And if you take all 52 or 54 Commonwealth countries, they make up just 9% of all our exports.\u201d\n\nExports to the 51 other members of the Commonwealth\u2014a club of mostly former British colonies, some of which are very small countries\u2014were just 9% of UK exports in 2015, figures assembled by the House of Commons Library show. The value of those exports has actually fallen in the past few years.\n\nBy contrast, 44% of exports go to other EU countries. That share was declining until 2013 but has been steady since.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that the top 10 Commonwealth export destinations make up 8% of total exports\u2014and two of those (Cyprus and Malta) are also in the EU. Pakistan, incidentally, falls outside the top 10.\n\nThat said, if you were to expand the Commonwealth to include countries with significant historical ties to the UK that just happen not to be members\u2014Ireland and the United States\u2014its share of UK exports would rise to around one third.\n\nThe Commonwealth isn\u2019t a trading bloc like the EU. While its members trade with one another, there\u2019s no free trade agreement linking them all together.\n\n\u201cConventional thinking among trade policy experts and policy makers suggests that a free trade area of the Commonwealth would be an utter impossibility for legal and political reasons\u201d, according to a 2013 report for the International Trade Centre. But Brexit provides the opportunity to make trade agreements with individual Commonwealth countries, which we can\u2019t as an EU member.", "lang": "en"}
