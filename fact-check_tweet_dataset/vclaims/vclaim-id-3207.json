They did \u2014 with varying success. President Bill Clinton signed bills in the 1990s that banned certain semi-automatic weapons and created the background check system for prospective gun buyers. President Barack Obama developed a plan in 2013 to reduce gun violence, but it was blocked by Congress.\n\u2022 Trump suggested that Obama might have been looking for \u201can excuse not to sign\u201d a bill in 2013 that would have expanded gun background checks. Obama endorsed the bill, which was defeated largely along party lines.\n\u2022 Trump claimed that if \u201cone person \u2026 could carry a gun\u201d at the Pulse nightclub in 2016, that mass shooting \u201cwouldn\u2019t have happened, or certainly not to the extent it did.\u201d In fact, an armed police officer working security for the club that night traded gunfire with the shooter.\n\u2022 The president also cited the disputed statistic that \u201c98 percent of all mass shootings in the United States, since 1950, have taken place in gun-free zones.\u201d Another count of mass shootings since 1966 put the figure at about 16 percent.\n\u2022 Trump said Republican Sen. Toomey may have been \u201cafraid of the NRA,\u201d and therefore didn\u2019t include in his 2013 legislation a provision to increase the age to purchase some guns. The next day, Toomey said that was \u201cridiculous.\u201d In fact, the NRA did not support Toomey in his 2016 campaign.\n\nDuring the meeting, Democrats repeatedly told the president that as a Republican he is in an unique position to convince other Republicans to buck the National Rifle Association and pass a gun-control bill. Trump agreed, describing himself at the meeting as the \u201cbiggest fan of the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nSen. Christopher Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told Trump, \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be you that brings the Republicans to the table on this because right now the gun lobby would stop it in its tracks.\u201d\n\nPast presidents have \u201cstepped up,\u201d but with mixed results.\n\nIn 1993, President Clinton signed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act \u2014 so named after former White House Press Secretary Jim Brady, who was severely wounded in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan\u2019s life in 1981. The law initially imposed a five-day waiting period before a licensed firearm dealer could sell or transfer a handgun, providing law enforcement with time to conduct background checks on prospective buyers. It also required the creation of an instant background check system, which was implemented five years after the Brady bill took effect.\n\nIn 1994, Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a ban on certain semi-automatic weapons for 10 years. The ban expired in 2004, and Democrats \u2014 led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California \u2014 have attempted to revive it ever since. During the 2016 campaign, Trump opposed reinstating the ban, saying such weapons are needed for protection.\n\nPresident Obama had less success, although not for lack of trying. He proposed reinstating the ban as part of his 2013 plan to reduce gun violence. That plan also called for legislation requiring universal background checks for anyone trying to buy a gun and a 10-round limit for magazines. A divided Congress did not consider any of those proposals.\n\nObama also proposed 23 \u201cexecutive actions\u201d that did not require legislative approval, such as a rule that required \u201cfederal agencies to make all relevant records, including criminal history records and information related to persons prohibited from having guns for mental health reasons, available to the federal background check system.\u201d One of those agencies, the Social Security Administration, did enact a rule to expand its reporting requirements, but Trump signed legislation last year repealing it.\n\nTrump would have been right to say no meaningful legislation passed under Obama, but he ignores Clinton\u2019s success in passing gun laws and minimizes Obama\u2019s attempts when he says past presidents did not step up to address gun violence.\n\nLater in the meeting, Trump had this exchange with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who co-sponsored a bipartisan bill with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey to expand background checks for prospective gun buyers. Again, the exchange illustrates Democrats pressing Trump, as a Republican, to take a lead in pushing legislation through a GOP-controlled Congress, and Trump again being dismissive of his predecessor.\n\nManchin: Mr. President, the difference is this: There\u2019s not a person in West Virginia that believes that you\u2019re not going to defend their Second Amendment rights \u2014 not a person. With you taking a lead on something like this, it gives them the comfort that something reasonable \u2014 and this bill\u2019s been vetted for over five years, and over 70, 80 percent, even, of gun owners say, \u201cWe like your bill, Pat and Joe. We\u2019re just afraid that President Obama would take it further, and take more rights away.\u201d That\u2019s what I was running into in West Virginia. Trump: Or use that as an excuse not to sign it. Manchin: Well, this is not \u2026 Trump: Because he was not proactive in getting a bill signed, in all fairness.\n\nTrump misrepresents Obama\u2019s actions leading up to the April 17, 2013, vote on a bipartisan compromise offered by Toomey and Manchin as an amendment to the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Obama supported the bipartisan measure.\n\nHe put out a statement on April 10, a week before the vote, that said he wished it were \u201cstronger,\u201d but nevertheless it represented \u201cwelcome and significant bipartisan progress.\u201d He urged Congress to \u201cfinish the job,\u201d and asked the Senate to \u201covercome obstruction by defeating a threatened filibuster, and allow a vote on this and other commonsense reforms to protect our kids and our communities.\u201d\n\nA day later, he put out an official statement of support for the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act, and that weekend he turned over his weekly address to the mother of a child who was killed in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The weekly address was part of a public lobbying campaign to pressure Congress to pass the bill.\n\n\u201cNow that the Senate has agreed that commonsense gun safety reforms deserve a vote, they must finish the job and pass those reforms to protect our children and our communities,\u201d the Obama White House said on a web page hosting the weekly address. \u201cNow is the time for all Americans to help make this a moment of real change.\u201d\n\nThe bill received 50 votes from the Democratic caucus, but only four Republican votes \u2014 falling six votes shy of the 60 votes needed to end the filibuster.\n\nAfter the vote, Obama criticized the Senate for blocking \u201ccommon-sense gun reforms,\u201d calling the bill\u2019s defeat \u201ca pretty shameful day for Washington.\u201d\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s claim, Obama was proactive in trying to get the Manchin-Toomey legislation approved. And, contrary to Trump\u2019s speculation, there was no indication that Obama would use his desire for more sweeping gun control measures as \u201can excuse not to sign\u201d the Manchin-Toomey measure.\n\nThe president used a disputed statistic on mass shootings in \u201cgun-free zones\u201d and repeated a false claim he had made during the 2016 campaign about the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.\n\nTrump is wrong about the June 12, 2016, Pulse nightclub shooting in which 49 people were killed. There was indeed \u201cone person\u201d there who had a gun, \u201cknew how to use it\u201d and in fact did use it against the shooter.\n\nAn Orlando police officer, Adam Gruler, was working security for the club that night, and he traded gunshots with the gunman, Omar Mateen, near the club\u2019s entrance. Gruler had been a member of the Orlando Police Department since 2001.\n\nHere\u2019s the OPD statement on the exchange of gunfire:\n\nAlso, two of the responding officers were nearby and arrived not long after, firing at Mateen before he retreated to a club bathroom with hostages, several news reports said.\n\nDays after the shooting, Trump twice made the false claim that there were \u201cno guns on the other side.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201c98 percent of all mass shootings in the United States, since 1950, have taken place in gun-free zones,\u201d that figure has been disputed. It comes from an updated 2014 report from the Crime Prevention Research Center, founded by economist John Lott, whose work is often cited by gun rights advocates.\n\nCalculating such a statistic depends on one\u2019s definition of \u201cmass shooting\u201d and \u201cgun-free zone.\u201d\n\nLott\u2019s research cites \u201csix mass public shootings since at least 1950 that have not been part of some other crime where at least four people have been killed in an area where general civilians are allowed to have guns.\u201d\n\nBut in the book \u201cRampage Nation,\u201d Louis Klarevas, who teaches at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, identified 111 shootings since 1966 (where six or more people, not including the perpetrator, had been killed per incident, whether in a public or private place) and found 13 in a gun-free zone and five in a \u201cgun-restricting zone\u201d (where civilians can\u2019t have guns but there is regular armed security). That would be just 16 percent of mass shootings in a gun-free or gun-restricted zone.\n\nTo highlight one of the discrepancies: Lott says the 2015 shooting at an Oregon community college was in a gun-free zone, but as we found when researching the issue, that\u2019s not exactly the case. While Umpqua Community College does have policies prohibiting firearms on campus, a college official told us those prohibitions \u201cwould not apply to those with valid concealed weapon permits pursuant to Oregon law.\u201d\n\nKlarevas counts that incident as occurring in a gun-allowing zone.\n\nTrump joked (maybe?) that Republican Sen. Toomey didn\u2019t include a provision to increase the minimum age to purchase some guns to 21 in his 2013 amendment because he was \u201cafraid of the NRA.\u201d Toomey later called that suggestion \u201cridiculous.\u201d And, in fact, Toomey didn\u2019t get any contributions from the NRA in his 2016 Senate race.\n\nAs we explained, Toomey and Democratic Sen. Manchin were the co-authors of the 2013 Manchin-Toomey amendment, which would have expanded background checks to private sales by unlicensed individuals at gun shows and over the internet.\n\nIn the bipartisan meeting this week, Trump asked legislators to use that Manchin-Toomey amendment as a starting point and to consider adding a provision that would raise the minimum age required to purchase some guns, like the one used in the Parkland, Florida, shooting, from 18 to 21. Trump asked Toomey if such a provision was considered for inclusion in the 2013 amendment.\n\n\u201cYou know why?\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re afraid of the NRA, right?\u201d\n\nThe president was smiling, but it was a pointed comment.\n\nManchin responded that raising the age to 21 wasn\u2019t an issue back then, and such a provision never came up for a vote.\n\nOn \u201cFox & Friends\u201d the following morning, Toomey was asked about Trump\u2019s jab. He called it \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe NRA strongly opposed the Manchin-Toomey amendment. NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told us then that the vote on the Manchin-Toomey amendment \u201cwas considered a gun control vote\u201d and that it would have \u201cdiminished 2nd Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nOnly four Republicans, including Toomey, voted for the amendment, which failed to move forward after a 54-46 vote.\n\nAs a result of the legislation, Toomey\u2019s rating with the NRA dropped from an \u201cA\u201d to a \u201cC,\u201d and the endorsements and contributions Toomey got from the NRA in previous House and Senate races disappeared. In 2016, the NRA stayed out of Toomey\u2019s Senate race altogether; his Democratic opponent, Katie McGinty, had an \u201cF\u201d grade from the NRA. In that race, Toomey got the endorsement of a gun-control group, Everytown for Gun Safety, which ran ads supporting him.\n\nLater in the meeting, Trump boasted that while the NRA has \u201cgreat power over you people [congressmen], they have less power over me. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\n\nTrump may not need the NRA, but he got an awful lot of financial support from it in the presidential election. The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics wrote that while it is \u201cnot at all clear how much of a factor [Trump\u2019s] embrace of the NRA\u2019s hardline position on gun rights played into the outcome\u201d of the election, the NRA\u2019s $30.3 million investment in support of Trump and in opposition to Hillary Clinton was unmatched by any other outside group.", "lang": "en"}
