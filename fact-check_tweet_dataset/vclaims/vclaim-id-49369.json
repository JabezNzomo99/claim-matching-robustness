(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe claim is flawed in a number of ways.\n\nWhat the article says\n\nThe article appears on the website of Collective Evolution, which describes itself as a \"conscious media company focused on personal transformation.\"\n\nThe article claims the CDC might have to stop calling COVID-19 an epidemic because the death rate is becoming so low that it wouldn\u2019t meet the CDC\u2019s definition of epidemic. It does not cite any death rate figures.\n\nThe article cites a CDC webpage, but that page does not refer to death rates in describing what an epidemic is.\n\nThe CDC page says: \"Epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.\"\n\nHealth officials and leaders have made several official declarations about the novel coronavirus. But the major ones weren\u2019t about declaring an epidemic, and none were made by the CDC:\n\nWhat the CDC says\n\nIn its weekly summary of COVID-19 activity, the CDC gave no indication that a drop in deaths signaled a turning point. The latest report available when the Facebook post was made was for the week ended June 27.\n\nIt said about death rates:\n\n\"Mortality attributed to COVID-19 decreased compared to last week and is currently at the epidemic threshold, but will likely increase as additional death certificates are processed.\"\n\nThe same statement was made in the latest report, for the week ended July 4.\n\nThe epidemic threshold \"refers to the point at which the observed proportion of deaths is significantly higher than would be expected at that time of the year in the absence of substantial influenza, and now COVID-related mortality.\" Deaths are a lagging indicator of COVID-19, partly because of a delay in the processing of death certificates. Death rates alone don\u2019t \"have bearing on whether COVID-19 is still an epidemic,\" given that the extent of the outbreak is the primary factor.\n\nAn article widely shared on Facebook claimed: \"The CDC may have to stop calling COVID-19 an \u2018epidemic\u2019 due to a remarkably low death rate.\"\n\nThe latest CDC statement made public when the Facebook post was made said deaths attributed to COVID-19 decreased from the previous week, but remained at the epidemic threshold, and were likely to increase. Moreover, death rates alone do not define an epidemic.", "lang": "en"}
