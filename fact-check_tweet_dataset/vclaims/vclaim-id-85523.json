So far, 31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid eligibility.\n\nLike all health insurance markets, Medicaid is constantly churning enrollees. So people on Medicaid by the time the BCRA takes effect would not be the same population of people who are \u201ccurrently\u201d on Medicaid. Some people may leave Medicaid if, for example, they had access to employer health insurance. They may not be able to get back on Medicaid if they sought to later, if the eligibility changes.\n\nThe cap on federal reimbursements begins in fiscal 2020, and the reduction in federal matching rates for newly eligible adults in expansion states starts in fiscal 2021. Under Obamacare, the federal government initially paid 100 percent of the states\u2019 costs for the newly eligible population. That match will phase down to 90 percent by 2020 and beyond. Under BCRA, that match would be phased down to an average of 57 percent, according to CBO.\n\nStates can make choices that are best for them regardless of BCRA, and it doesn\u2019t mean that federal law would \u201ccause\u201d these changes, explained McConnell\u2019s staff. Some states would choose to keep their current level of Medicaid coverage, and change their state budget priorities to make that work.\n\nBut some states would scale back or eliminate coverage for newly insured Medicaid populations because of the financing changes in BCRA, according to CBO. Other enrollees would become eligible for subsidies for the individual market or could choose to enroll in their employers\u2019 insurance if they have the option.\n\n\u201cWith less federal reimbursement for Medicaid, states would need to decide whether to commit more of their own resources to finance the program at current-law levels or to reduce spending by cutting payments to health-care providers and health plans, eliminating optional services, restricting eligibility for enrollment through work requirements and other changes, or (to the extent feasible) arriving at more efficient methods for delivering services,\u201d CBO found.\n\nExperts say decreased federal reimbursement would place pressure on states to make changes on who and what they cover, and how they pay providers. Some states already are considering cuts due to state budget gaps. States have no easy options when responding to cuts to federal matches, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nKaiser Family Foundation\u2019s president and chief executive Drew Altman wrote about the reality gap in such rhetoric, in an op-ed in The Washington Post: \u201cThere is no way states can replace funds of this magnitude. \u2026 The idea that a phaseout would give states time to plan and adjust is driven by a belief that states can operate Medicaid with far less money if they have greater flexibility. In this case, with funding cuts this large, it\u2019s simply wishful thinking.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s staff noted that states still chose to expand Medicaid before Obamacare, even with lower federal matches. But at the time, there wasn\u2019t really a pathway for Medicaid eligibility for adults without dependents (the population newly eligible under Obamacare), except through Medicaid waivers that are budget-neutral to the federal government. That means the scope of eligible enrollees and federal financing was different pre-Obamacare than under Obamacare, where states expanded with the incentive of getting 90-plus percent of federal matching funds.\n\nMcConnell says the Senate GOP health overhaul bill does not \u201ccause\u201d anyone \u201ccurrently\u201d on Medicaid to no longer be covered. \u201cCurrently\u201d is a key word, because there is a constant churn in the Medicaid population. The population that is currently enrolled in Medicaid would not be the same population by the time BCRA takes effect.\n\nHis staff explained that the BCRA does not mandate any states to change or cut their Medicaid program, and people losing coverage would be a state choice, not something \u201ccaused\u201d by the proposal. But this is misleading. Mandate or not, the Senate GOP health bill would decrease federal reimbursement for Medicaid, and states would need to decide how to move forward with less federal money. This would create pressures on states to cut or eliminate coverage for certain populations, and some people would \u201ccome off\u201d Medicaid.", "lang": "en"}
