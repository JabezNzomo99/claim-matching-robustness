The claim, however, is misleading; the video shows an incident in Pakistan\u2019s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region that was sparked by a land dispute; in Islam, planting trees is considered an act of charity.\n\nThe one-minute and seven-second video was published here on Facebook on August 10, 2020. It has been viewed more than 5,500 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cImran Khan copied PM Shri Modi\u2019s \u2018Tree Plantation Drive\u2019 in Pakistan but his followers uprooted all trees because they feel 'Planting trees is against Islam'.\"\n\nThe second part of the caption in Hindi translates to English as: \u201cThank you Jinnah uncle for taking all the buffoons with you to the other side.\u201d\n\nImran Khan is the prime minister of Pakistan. On August 8, 2020, Khan tweeted that as many trees as possible should be planted across the country.\n\nMuhammed Ali Jinnah is the founder of Pakistan.\n\nThe video was also shared here and here on Facebook; and here and here on Twitter with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex found a similar video was published here on Facebook on August 9, 2020.

'One of the parties was present when the campaign was inaugurated, while the other was unaware about the drive and uprooted the saplings,' he said.\u201d\n\nIn Islam, planting trees is considered an act of charity.\n\nIn the book Sahih al-Bukhari, regarded as one of the most trusted collections of Prophet Muhammad\u2019s quotes and verses, a verse attributed to Muhammad reads: \"There is none amongst the Muslims who plants a tree or sows seeds, and then a bird, or a person or an animal eats from it, but is regarded as a charitable gift for him.\"", "lang": "en"}
