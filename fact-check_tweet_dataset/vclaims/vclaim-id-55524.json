Apart from the headline and the main photos, the rest of the page was blurred.\n\nThe facts: Revilla did not propose to make Culion Island in Palawan the next Bilibid prison. The photo of the Manila Bulletin frontpage in the post was manipulated to include Revilla's photo, a photo of Culion Island, and a fictitious headline.\n\nInstead, he grilled Bureau of Corrections (BuCOr) Chief Nicanor Faeldon over the photo of Sanchez which went viral following reports of his release. The photo, which included Sanchez and his daughter Councilor Ave Marie Tonee \"Amty\" Sanchez-Alcid, was supposedly taken in a hospital facility outside the prison.\n\nBy searching through manilabulletin.pressreader.com \u2013 the digital edition of Manila Bulletin \u2013 Rappler found what appears to be the issue that had some stories and photos similar to the ones in the TRAPOlitics post. Released on July 4, 2016, this issue contained the following stories and features similar to the headlines blurred in the manipulated photo:\n\nThe blurred headline below Revilla's picture, which reads, \"PH needs own Department of Homeland security, says DILG,\" was an ABS-CBN article published on September 9, 2019. A Google search yielded no results for the headline of the article at the center, which reads: \"Bilibid is already congested I suggest we transfer it to Palawan.\"\n\nThe idea of having an island prison is not new. In 2016, Senator Tito Sotto proposed a secluded prison in Palawan for convicted drug criminals. The idea resurfaced after Senator Miguel Zubiri filed a bill seeking to establish a special prison facility for those convicted of heinous crimes.\n\nSenate Bill No. 1004, which proposes the creation of a heinous crimes penitentiary \u2013 preferably in an island to prevent the prisoners from escaping or from having unwarranted communication outside \u2013 does not specify which island should be used.
