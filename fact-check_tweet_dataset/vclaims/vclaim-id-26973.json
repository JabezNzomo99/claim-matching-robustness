No, that's not true: the story was posted by some joker to a prank website where anyone can publish realistic-looking news articles but the \"news\" has not been confirmed anywhere.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on actualite.co on February 3, 2019 titled \"La mort de G\u00e9rard Jugnot t\u00f4t ce matin .\" (archived here) which read:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut actualite.co carries a disclaimer at the bottom of the page:\n\nThe site is part of a much larger network of sites that all work or worked on the same principle:\n\nUsers don't even need to upload their own image, there is a built-in search function that will pull an appropriate image from Google image search.\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of prank sites all using the same basic layout but sometimes in different languages. It appears to be run by a Belgian company named Mediavibes or Media Vibes which is managed by a man named Nicolas Gouriou according to registration records.\n\nEach site in the network comes with a disclaimer (sometimes translated into a different language) that reads:\n\nSo don't fall for this prank now that we've warned you about it!", "lang": "en"}
