It furthers instigates prison inmates and police to kill them.\n\nThe Hindi caption accompanying the images translates to the following.\n\n\u201cThis is a request for all the brothers who are jailed and their relatives. These people in the pictures have kidnapped children and taken their kidneys out to sell them. Police have caught them and they are now behind the bars. Request all my brothers in the prison to kill them inside the prison so that it is a lesson for the rest of the people who who think of doing something like this. If cops can kill them instead of arresting them, then it would be even better!\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that all the images are old and unrelated. The same were debunked by BOOM earlier on different occasions when they were used to falsely spread child abduction rumours through social media.\n\nThe images of three injured men are from Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. The incident occurred on August 7, when a self proclaimed godman and two of his disciples were beaten up on suspicion of being child kidnappers.\n\nThe Gwalior Police told the Quint that they were saved after two constables intervened.\n\nThe same was reported by Dainik Bhaskar. A video of the group being heckled by the mob was also doing the rounds on Facebook.\n\nThe third image was shared with a misleading caption which claimed that 25 people accused of child abduction were arrested by Ratlam Police.\n\nBOOM found that the image is originally of a sex racket that was busted in Ratlam last month.\n\nALSO READ: Child Kidnapping Rumours Fuelled In Madhya Pradesh With Unrelated Videos And Images\n\nA disturbing image of bodies of five children floating in a well was from Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Barwani district.
