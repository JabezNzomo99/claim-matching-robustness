Let us ascertain the veracity of these pictures.\n\nClaim: Photos of dead bodies of terrorists and building debris due to IAF strike on JeM training camp at Balakot Fact: The pictures being claimed as the dead bodies of terrorists and building debris struck by IAF jets are actually the images captured at the time of an deadly earth quake in the same place in the year 2005. Hence the claim is FALSE. The earthquake hit Azad Kashmir and Northen Pakistan then.\n\nA reverse image search on the photos show that the pictures being claimed as the dead bodies of terrorists and building struck by IAF jets are actually the images captured at the time of an deadly earth quake that hit Azad Kashmir and Northen Pakistan in the year 2005 and reportedly claiming 80,000 people and injuring about 1,00,000 persons. The original pictures can be found on gettyimages website as well here and here.\n\nFinally, the photos posted on Facebook as the outcome of Indian Air Force attack are actually those taken in the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake. Hence the claim is false.", "lang": "en"}
