Before Obamacare, insurance companies could consider a person\u2019s health status when determining premiums, sometimes making coverage unaffordable or even unavailable if a person was sick or had a condition that required expensive treatment. The ACA included a series of provisions that prohibited such practices, but then Republicans spent years trying to repeal the law.\n\nScott is not in the House or Senate, so we included his quote because of its \u201chuh\u201d factor. We will now turn our attention to Taylor and McSally, and their claims about having fought insurance companies.\n\nThe statement in Taylor\u2019s ad is cleverly divided into two parts. He says he \u201cstood up to insurance companies\u201d and voted to \u201cprotect people with preexisting conditions.\u201d It does not quite have the direct link in the other two ads.\n\nBut it\u2019s still fishy. The Taylor campaign cited a 2017 vote in favor of ending health insurance company anti-trust exemptions in the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945. In the House, this was not a controversial bill, as it has the support of dentists, surgeons and other physicians who want more clout to negotiate contracts with insurance companies. Insurers would be prohibited from engaging in price-fixing, bid-rigging and market allocation in an aim to increase competition and lower premiums. It passed 416-7, but the Senate.has taken no action.\n\nThe campaign also points to Taylor\u2019s co-sponsorship of a bill called the Transparent Health Care Pricing Act of 2018. No action has been taken on it. In addition, the campaign points to two relatively minor bills on drug pricing that became law. Both originated in the Senate and were passed by a voice vote in the House.\n\nTwenty Republicans voted against the AHCA, in part because of their uneasiness with the changes proposed for the provisions regarding preexisting conditions. That unease was confirmed when the Congressional Budget Office issued a critical report three weeks after the vote. (We have written at length about this before.) The CBO was skeptical that the AHCA would work without harming people with preexisting conditions, in part because of inadequate funding.\n\nSo while there was language in the bill saying nothing in it would \u201climit access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions,\u201d that still did not protect people from price increases. The CBO said that in some states, insurance might simply become unaffordable for people with certain diseases.\n\nRegarding the McSally ad, it says she was leading the fight \u2013 for something people already had under the ACA. Her campaign did not respond to a request for an explanation but told our colleagues at PolitiFact that she \u201csuccessfully negotiated $8 billion in additional funding to bring down insurance costs for people with preexisting conditions.\u201d The amendment helped swing some votes that assured passage, but remember how the CBO said the bill did not have enough funding? That was specifically referencing that $8 billion.\n\nWhile the CBO expects \u201cthat federal funding would have the intended effect of lowering premiums and out-of-pocket payments to some extent, its effect on community-rated premiums would be small because the funding would not be sufficient to substantially reduce the large increases in premiums for high-cost enrollees,\u201d the report said. \u201cTo evaluate the potential effect of the $8 billion fund, looking back at the high-risk pool program funded by the ACA prior to 2014 is useful. Within two years, the combined enrollment of about 100,000 enrollees in that program resulted in federal spending of close to $2.5 billion.\u201d The CBO then referenced a report that said \u201cthese high-risk pools likely covered just a fraction of the number of people with preexisting conditions who lacked insurance.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the $8 billion was woefully inadequate. During the debate over the Senate version of repeal, which did not pass, Trump said the House version was \u201cmean\u201d because it did not go far enough to protect individuals in the insurance markets. He urged the Senate to add more funds to cover people with preexisting conditions.\n\nUnder fire from their Democratic rivals for their votes on health care, McSally and Taylor are misleading voters. The protections for people with preexisting conditions are already pretty strong in the ACA. Both lawmakers cast votes that the CBO said weakened protections against price increases, especially in states that took advantage of waivers in the law. The money contained in the bill to mitigate those problems was inadequate, the CBO concluded.", "lang": "en"}
