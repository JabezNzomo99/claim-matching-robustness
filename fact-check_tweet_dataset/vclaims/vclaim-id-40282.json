There\u2019s been concern raised that this could confuse and may even discourage voters born in 2000 and 2001 who are eligible to vote.\n\nWe don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be worried about here. We contacted Cheshire West and Chester Council (where one of the postal ballot photos came from). They said that they do pre-fill the date of birth on postal ballots, but that voters born in 2000 or 2001 would receive a ballot prefilled accordingly with \u201c20..\u201d\n\nThat was also the response of Bromley Council (which was claimed to be the source of another of the questioned ballots). They told us that the chance of someone receiving an erroneously pre-filled ballot was very small, but that if anyone born in the 2000s does, they should just cross the \u201c19\u201d out and write their actual year of birth above.\n\nPostal ballots are pre-filled like this to discourage people from mistakenly writing in the current date, rather than their date of birth.", "lang": "en"}
