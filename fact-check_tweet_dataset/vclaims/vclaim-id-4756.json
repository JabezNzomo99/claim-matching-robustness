No, that's not true: the story was originally published by a website specializing in making up stories about bizarre crimes and weird sex acts purely for entertainment purposes. It did not really happen.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on July 5, 2018 titled \"Allergic man rushed to hospital after girlfriend spread peanut butter on her vagina\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nBakersfield, CA | A Californian man is being hospitalized after his girlfriend spread peanut butter on her vagina to punish her cheating boyfriend. Jane Lee Hopkins, 21, allegedly spread peanut butter on her vagina to teach her boyfriend a lesson after suspecting him of infidelity, fully knowing he had a severe peanut allergy. Mike Hunt, 24, was diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy since birth and luckily had an EpiPen when his allergic reaction to peanuts became evident moments during sexual intercourse.\n\nThe image used to illustrate the article is at least four years old and was posted to Reddit by someone who said it was his friend who took a selfie after getting an allergic reaction:\n\nFriend had an allergic reaction and took a hospital selfie\n\nAnd the photo of the \"girlfriend\" is actually taken from a video about a teen from Miami whose photos meant for her boyfriend leaked online:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: MH370 Pilot Did NOT Mysteriously Resurface Almost 2 Years After His Flight Vanished Over China Sea\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Sue Strip Club, Did NOT Contract Syphilis After Licking Dance Pole\n\u2022 Fake News: SeaWorld Employee NOT Arrested For Smuggling Penguin Penises To China\n\u2022 Fake News: 6-year-old Migrant In Sweden Was NOT In Fact A 35-year-old Midget From Syria\n\u2022 Fake News: Museum Employee NOT Arrested For Sexually Assaulting Wax Sculpture of Donald Trump", "lang": "en"}
