The idea was to give people an option similar to individual retirement accounts, and encourage people to shop around for cheaper health care since they would pay for much of the costs out of their own pockets.\n\nSantorum held a news conference announcing the bill on Feb. 5, 1992, with a coalition of House Republicans co-sponsoring the bill. The chief sponsors were Santorum and John Kasich of Ohio (now the state\u2019s governor and potential 2016 opponent). Former House minority whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, Richard Zimmer (N.J.), Dan Burton (Ind.) and Tom Delay (Texas) were among lawmakers unveiling the proposal that day. The bill was, indeed, the first proposal for medical savings accounts (MSAs) \u2014 precursor to the current health savings accounts (HSAs) \u2014 and it laid the groundwork for lawmakers to introduce alternative proposals for such accounts in 1992 and thereafter.\n\nSantorum continued to support such savings accounts in the Senate. HSAs, as they are known today, were authorized by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Santorum included HSA in the Medicare bill as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, and this \u201cfrankly, is one of the sole reasons he voted for it on the floor of the Senate,\u201d said Matthew Beynon, Santorum\u2019s spokesman. Beynon added that \u201cto suggest that anyone other than Senator Santorum is the father of the health savings accounts countless Americans benefit daily from is as wrong as calling the sky green.\u201d\n\nSantorum is correct on his legislative record, but he did not \u201cinvent\u201d HSAs. His name is not among the typical \u201cFathers\u201d who are credited with the concept of MSAs and HSAs, and several experts we reached out to scratched their heads at his comment.\n\nIn 1990, a task force of 40 think tanks, research groups and universities came up with a proposal. Patrick Rooney, former chairman of Golden Rule Insurance, was the first to offer MSAs to his employees. Goodman, Hixson, Musgrave and Rooney have all been called the \u201cFather\u201d of HSAs and MSAs. (This summary provides more details on the history of HSAs.)\n\nAround 1993-94, MSAs became especially popular as a consumer-focused alternative to the Clinton administration\u2019s ill-fated health-care proposal, which required employers to offer health insurance to employees. There were more than a dozen bills introduced as alternatives to what was seen by Republicans as a top-down approach to health care. (In 1994, Santorum introduced a bill with Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas to allow employers to provide medical savings accounts.)\n\nMSAs were authorized in 1996 under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which folded in several bills related to MSAs. The lawmaker whose name is most associated with MSAs is Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, then-chair of Ways and Means Committee who sponsored HIPAA. It gave small employers and self-employed individuals the option to create MSAs to reduce health insurance premiums and allow people to build a tax-free fund to pay for small medical expenses. These became known as \u201cArcher MSAs.\u201d\n\nTo the point about Gore, he never actually said he \u201cinvented\u201d the Internet. The Fact Checker previously found that Gore used an awkward phrasing that he \u201ctook the initiative in creating the Internet,\u201d to reference his work in Congress to advance funding for research to support creating the Internet. Then it was spun out of context, through media reports and other politicians, to the false claim now attributed to Gore.\n\nSantorum, not the economists, worked for 11 years in Congress to push HSAs and \u201cis the legislator who got the health savings accounts passed,\u201d according to Beynon. \u201cTo credit anyone else is like saying someone else deserves credit for a part of your college degree. You earned it. You deserve credit for it,\u201d Beynon told us. \u201cSame with health savings accounts and Rick Santorum.\u201d\n\nBut to claim he \u201cinvented\u201d HSAs goes too far. Success has a thousand fathers, as they say, and Santorum is not the only one who can claim paternity of HSAs. It took more than a decade of research by a wide coalition of think tanks, economists, analysts and academics before it took off on Capitol Hill. Even there, Santorum was among many lawmakers who shepherded legislation to create what are now known as HSAs.\n\nIn 2013, The Fact Checker wrote that Gore deserved at least Two Pinocchios for his statement about \u201ccreating\u201d the Internet. Had The Fact Checker existed in 1999, we would have made that ruling for the self-centered, exaggerated statement that obscured the fact that Gore passed legislation that helped foster the Internet. We will use the same standard we used for Gore. Santorum has a real story to tell about his achievements as a supporter of HSA. There is no need to go another step to exaggerate that he \u201cinvented\u201d it.", "lang": "en"}
