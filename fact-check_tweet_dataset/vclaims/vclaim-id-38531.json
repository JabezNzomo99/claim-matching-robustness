All of that needs to be investigated.\"\n\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, Fox News pointed to four TV segments where Hilton explained his theories at length. But we found no proof that Biden directed any aid earmarked for Ukraine to Burisma. And while the gas company did hire lobbyist David Leiter, Kerry\u2019s former Senate chief of staff, there\u2019s no evidence that any money was channeled in the way Hilton claimed.\n\nThere\u2019s no proof that U.S. aid money went to Burisma\n\nHilton\u2019s first claim \u2014 that U.S. aid dollars sent to Ukraine under Biden\u2019s supervision went toward Burisma, where Biden\u2019s son Hunter was a board member \u2014 is unsubstantiated, experts told us.\n\n\"It\u2019s indisputable that aid went to Ukraine's energy sector,\" Fox News said in its statement. \"No one knows how much, if any, Burisma specifically got as that has not been reported. It\u2019s about investigating possible corruption and exposing it.\"\n\nTrump and his allies have charged, without evidence, that Biden forced Ukraine to remove its lead prosecutor in order to protect his son from a then-dormant investigation into Burisma. The idea that Biden actively funnelled money to Burisma is also baseless, experts said.\n\n\"I can see no way that USAID money has gone to Burisma,\" said Anders \u00c5slund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\n\"I am not aware of Burisma receiving any U.S. funds,\" added Yoshiko Herrera, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who previously headed the university\u2019s center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia.\n\nUkraine has been a leading recipient of foreign aid since Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Data from the United States Agency for International Development indicates that the United States disbursed about $1.28 billion to Ukraine between 2014 and 2016, with roughly $53 million going to its energy department.\n\nThe United States also sent separate $1 billion loan guarantees in 2014, 2015 and 2016. And a 2014 law authorized $50 million to be sent between 2016 and 2018.\n\nBut the context is critical. After Russia invaded in 2014, the international community stepped in to bolster the new western-leaning government.\n\nMoney directed to Ukraine\u2019s energy sector was to help Ukraine scale back its dependence on Russia for energy sources by making it more energy efficient, according to the Congressional Research Service, which noted that the United States provided \"technical assistance.\"\n\nTo that end, the 2014 law authorizing additional funds took specific steps toward \"helping Ukraine reduce its dependence on natural gas imported from the Russian Federation.\"\n\nA November 2014 White House fact sheet said the United States was working with international donors to help Ukraine boost energy efficiency and supporting Ukraine\u2019s efforts to enhance energy production and restructure its state-owned gas company, Naftogaz, among other things.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that any of this aid or support went directly to Burisma, nor is there evidence that Joe Biden worked to guide it there.\n\n\"All this money went to the Ukrainian government,\" \u00c5slund said. \"None of it went to Burisma.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no proof of wrongdoing by Kerry or Democratic senators\n\nHilton\u2019s second claim \u2014 that a Kerry associate paid off Democratic senators to orchestrate the transfer of money to Burisma \u2014 is also unsubstantiated.\n\nWhat\u2019s true is that David Leiter, a lobbyist hired in 2014 by Burisma, served as Kerry\u2019s chief of staff for seven years while Kerry was a senator for Massachusetts. Kerry spokesman Matt Summers said Leiter left the office in 1997, 16 years before Kerry became secretary of state.\n\nBut the rest of Hilton\u2019s claim, which alleges a sequence of money transfers and bribes meant to line Hunter Biden\u2019s pockets, is an unsupported take on a series of unrelated events.\n\nIn short, Hilton\u2019s claim is that taxpayer money flowed from the United States to Burisma, from Burisma to Leiter, and finally from Leiter to Democratic Sens. Ed Markey and Jeanne Shaheen, who then pushed President Barack Obama to send more money Ukraine\u2019s way.\n\nThe conspiracy hinges on the fact that Leiter was hired by Burisma in 2014, while he was working as a registered lobbyist at a firm called ML Strategies. Lobbying disclosure forms show that ML Strategies took in $90,000 for Leiter\u2019s work with the Ukrainian company.\n\nHilton has alleged that Leiter used this money to pay off Markey, Shaheen and others, who sent a letter to Obama on June 27, 2014, urging his administration to \"leverage the full resources and expertise of the US government to assist Ukraine in improving its energy efficiency\" for the sake of \"eliminating its dependence on natural gas imports from Russia.\"\n\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, Shaheen\u2019s office pointed out that two weeks before the letter was sent, Russia had cut off all gas exports to Ukraine, a detail the senators noted in their letter.\n\nBut the biggest problem with Hilton\u2019s timeline is that the bulk of Leiter\u2019s donations to the Democratic senators who penned the letter came before he was hired at Burisma.\n\nAccording to Time, Leiter signed on to lobby for Burisma on May 20, 2014. He sent multiple donations to both Markey and Shaheen, but not one coincided with his stint lobbying for Burisma.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Shaheen\u2019s office also noted that the senators\u2019 goal \u2014 as expressed in the letter \u2014 was to reduce Ukraine\u2019s gas consumption and make the country more energy efficient, which would have been at odds with Burisma\u2019s ability to maximize profits.", "lang": "en"}
