If the word becomes red, an account is supposedly \u201csafe,\u201d but if it remains black, it is hackable and in need of a change in password. Another version alleges that a black \u201cgratula\u201d means the account is logged in on another device somewhere.\n\nThis is not true.\n\nThe word\u2019s color change does not determine the security of an FB account. It is due to an FB feature called Text Delight, which changes the color of certain words and phrases and provides animation like a flying star, a flower bouquet, or confetti. Most of these selected words and phrases are common greetings and remarks.\n\n\u201cGratula,\u201d for example, is the Hungarian word for \u201ccongratulations.\"\n\nThe same false advisory has circulated in other countries like France, Nigeria, South Africa and Malaysia much earlier. It has been fact checked by media organizations 20 minutes in 2018 in 2018, Africa Check in 2019 in 2019, and Agence France-Presse last July 28 last July 28.\n\nFilipino netizens, however, only started posting and sharing Filipino versions of the claim last July 29. The posts, according to CrowdTangle, experienced peaks in interactions on FB on July 31, as well as in Aug. 3, 6, and 8 or shortly after newly-appointed Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Lt. Gen. Gilbert Gapay expressed his desire to include provisions \u201cregulating social media\u201d in the implementing rules and regulations of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020. His remarks apparently made netizens more conscious of digital security, but in the wrong way.\n\nText Delight was the subject of a 2017 article published on Medium which attempted to list all of the keywords that may activate color changes and animations through the FB feature rolled out that year. The list included \u201cgratula\u201d and translations of \u201ccongratulations\u201d in many other languages.\n\nSome Filipino words and phrases\u2014such as \u201cmasaya (fun/happy),\u201d \u201ckaya mo ito (you can do this),\u201d and \u201cthe best ka (you\u2019re the best)\u201d\u2014are also on the list.\n\nThe same Medium article also reported that some FB users had encountered difficulties in activating and seeing Text Delight animations, crediting this to differences in the users\u2019 country and language settings.\n\nIn 2018, Facebook said there is no official list of words that trigger colors and animations under Text Delight, adding it just wants the features to be fun and unexpected and have users \"discover the effects themselves.\u201d\n\nCrowdTangle found 38 posts and re-posts published since July 29 by local FB pages and public FB groups carrying the spurious security-check claim. They collectively garnered nearly 23,600 interactions from FB users, with posts in groups Wowowin Supporter GMA7, ML DiscipleGaming Group, and iNSECTiON FAN's OFFICIAL receiving the most interactions.\n\nThese are aside from the reposts of at least four private Filipino netizens, which already got a cumulative total of over 5,200 reactions, 36,200 comments, and 69,700 shares to date.", "lang": "en"}
