Among those incidents, CSIS states, the rise of attacks by white supremacists and anti-government extremists is \u201cof particular concern.\u201d\n\nThe issue of white nationalism came to the forefront after a gunman opened fire at two mosques in New Zealand on March 15, killing at least 50 people. In a manifesto posted by the alleged shooter, he describes himself as an \u201cordinary white man\u201d whose goal was to \u201ccrush immigration and deport those invaders already living on our soil\u201d and \u201censure the existence of our people, and a future for white children.\u201d In it, he answers the question of whether he is a supporter of Trump: \u201cAs a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose? Sure. As a policy maker and leader? Dear god no.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter told Trump on March 15 about the reference in the manifesto, Trump condemned the attack, which he described as \u201ca horrible, disgraceful thing and a horrible act.\u201d\n\nThe president was also asked by a reporter whether he saw \u201ctoday, white nationalism as a rising threat around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cI think it\u2019s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. I guess if you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that\u2019s the case. I don\u2019t know enough about it yet. They\u2019re just learning about the person and the people involved. But it\u2019s certainly a terrible thing.\u201d\n\nShortly after Trump made his comment, a reporter asked New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern whether she agreed with Trump\u2019s belief that \u201che did not think white supremacy worldwide was a problem that was rising in any way.\u201d\n\nOn CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on March 17, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib said Trump \u201cneeds to pick up the phone and call the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nTlaib, March 17: There\u2019s real data and information currently right now of the rise of white supremacy right here in this United States of America. He needs to look at the data and the information and the facts and actually listen and understand the tremendous responsibility he has in being our president, our leader of our country. He cannot just say it\u2019s a small group of people. There\u2019s too many deaths, not only from the synagogue to the black churches to the temples to the \u2014 now the mosques. We need to be speaking up against this, and it has to start with him reiterating the importance of real information and data that says it\u2019s on the rise. You can\u2019t just say it isn\u2019t, when the facts say the complete opposite.\n\nSo, what do the data show?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Justice Department\u2019s FBI data on hate crimes, since that was specifically referenced by Tlaib.\n\nAccording to the FBI, there were 7,175 hate crime incidents in 2017, a 17 percent increase from 2016 and the third year in a row with an increase. The number of incidents in 2017 was also the highest yearly total since 2008. About 58 percent of the hate crimes in 2017 were motivated by race/ethnicity/ancestry.\n\nDigging deeper into the numbers, anti-black or African American hate crime rose 16 percent to 2,013 incidents in 2017; anti-Hispanic incidents rose 24 percent, with 427 incidents; anti-Arab crimes doubled to 102 incidents. Anti-Jewish hate crime incidents also rose 37 percent to 938 in 2017, but anti-Islamic hate crimes dipped 11 percent to 273.\n\nExperts, however, caution that the FBI\u2019s hate crime statistics are an imperfect way to track the rise of white nationalism. Not all of the hate crimes overall were committed by white nationalists (some of the documented incidents, for example, were anti-white). The data do not identify the perpetrators that way.\n\nThere was also an increase in the number of agencies participating in reporting hate crimes to the FBI and a subsequent increase in the population covered of 5.7 percent between 2016 and 2017. So some of the increase is likely tied to that alone.\n\nIssues also have been raised about inconsistencies in the ways different jurisdictions report hate crimes, which skews the data. There are clearly differences in reporting standards used by different agencies, Heidi Beirich, who leads the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, told us. She noted, for example, that there was just one assault reported as a hate crime in Alabama in 2017, compared with 242 in California \u2014 which she said suggests hate crimes are under-reported in Alabama.\n\nBeirich said there is a lot of evidence pointing to a rising threat from white nationalism, but, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure FBI hate crime statistics prove the point.\u201d She notes that a Department of Justice crime victimization survey in 2015 found \u201cU.S. residents experienced an average of 250,000 hate crime victimizations each year from 2004 to 2015.\u201d But the survey does not show trends over time, Beirich said.\n\nFBI hate crime data \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit into a neat package\u201d when it comes to tracking the threat of white nationalism, John D. Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator and acting under secretary for intelligence and analysis of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama, told us in a phone interview. But Cohen, who also served in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under President George W. Bush, agrees there are other, more telling measures.\n\n\u201cThere is pretty broad agreement among law enforcement in the U.S. and the European Union that violence as a result of far-right groups, particularly white supremacists, is on the rise,\u201d said Cohen, who is currently a professor at Rutgers-Newark. \u201cIt\u2019s a growing problem. We are seeing more hate crimes and targeted attacks by people who identify with that ideology.\u201d\n\nThe Montgomery, Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks domestic extremism, last month reported a 7 percent rise in hate groups in the U.S. in 2018, with 1,020 groups identified. White nationalist groups, specifically, surged nearly 50 percent, growing from 100 chapters in 2017 to 148 in 2018.\n\nLast year marked the fourth year in a row that the number of hate groups increased, after a short period of decline. The rise, SPLC says, was fueled by political polarization, anti-immigrant views and the ease of spreading those ideologies through the internet.\n\nBeirich noted that Alexa web traffic analytics show the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer site now gets about 4.3 million page views a month.\n\n\u201cMore and more people are interested in their ideas,\u201d she said.\n\nIn an ABC News/Washington Post poll taken just after the Charlottesville rally in August 2017, 9 percent of the respondents said they thought it was strongly or somewhat acceptable to hold neo\u2013Nazi or white supremacist views. As ABC News reported at the time, that\u2019s equivalent to about 22 million Americans.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, meanwhile, reports that white supremacy groups have stepped up their propaganda efforts.\n\n\u201cADL\u2019s Center on Extremism (COE) continues to track an ever-growing number of white supremacist propaganda efforts, including the distribution of racist, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic fliers, stickers, banners and posters,\u201d according to a recent ADL report. \u201cThe 2018 data shows a 182% increase of incidents from the previous year, with 1,187 cases reported, compared to 421 in 2017.\u201d\n\nThe group said that level of activity far exceeded any of its previous distribution counts.\n\nThe ADL also reported that the number of racist rallies and demonstrations rose last year. \u201cAt least 91 white supremacist rallies or other public events attended by white supremacist were held in 2018, up from 76 the previous year, with hate groups increasingly employing \u2018flash mob\u2019 tactics to avoid advance publicity and scrutiny,\u201d the ADL reported.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an increase in the public expression of far right, white supremacist ideological viewpoints,\u201d Cohen told us. \u201cIt is more open in its expression, both online and in protests like in Charlottesville.\u201d\n\nCohen said he prefers to look at the issue from the perspective of an overall threat assessment. In today\u2019s climate, he said, it\u2019s not just a matter of tabulating the number of members of various white nationalist groups. The internet and social media have changed the game. People self-connect with ideologies espoused by hate groups online. They often act independently of those groups, he said, though they may be inspired by their messages.\n\nSo while the number of white nationalists could have remained steady, the threat they pose may be increasing, Cohen said. Whereas people with these ideas used to be isolated geographically, they are now able via the web to reach people who are disaffected and mentally unwell, inspiring them to commit violent acts.\n\nA November report called \u201cThe Rise of Far-Right Extremism in the United States\u201d from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that \u201cthe number of terrorist attacks by far-right perpetrators rose over the past decade, more than quadrupling between 2016 and 2017. \u2026 There has also been a rise in far-right attacks in Europe, jumping 43 percent between 2016 and 2017.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe threat from right-wing terrorism in the United States\u2014and Europe\u2014appears to be rising,\u201d wrote the report\u2019s author, Seth G. Jones. \u201cOf particular concern are white supremacists and anti-government extremists, such as militia groups and so-called sovereign citizens interested in plotting attacks against government, racial, religious, and political targets in the United States.\u201d\n\nAnother indicator is the perception among minority groups about the threat they face. Cohen pointed to a December 2018 report from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights that surveyed nearly 16,500 individuals who identify as being Jewish from 12 European Union countries and found widespread fear of being targeted for harassment and attacks.\n\nTrump may be correct that those who are members of white nationalist groups, compared with the overall population, are a \u201csmall group of people,\u201d Cohen said. If one looks at the number of gun crimes in the U.S., for example, the number of violent attacks carried out by white nationalists is a relatively small subset, he said. But law enforcement officials are concerned about the rising threat of white nationalists, their growing influence through social media and the devastating impact hate-inspired attacks have on the public.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a hearing in April on the rise of white nationalism in the U.S. According to the Daily Beast, \u201cthe committee expects to bring in officials from within DHS and the FBI for questioning on the rise of white nationalism in the U.S and the efforts the agencies are currently adopting to combat it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
