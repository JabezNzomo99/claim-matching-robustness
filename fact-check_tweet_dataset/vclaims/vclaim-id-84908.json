When House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) asked whether Clinton had lied to the American public, Comey dodged: \u201cThat\u2019s a question I\u2019m not qualified to answer. I can speak about what she said to the FBI.\u201d\n\nAt another point, Comey told Congress: \u201cI really don\u2019t want to get in the business of trying to parse and judge her public statements. And so I think I\u2019ve tried to avoid doing that sitting here. \u2026 What matters to me is what did she say to the FBI. That\u2019s obviously first and foremost for us.\u201d\n\nAs for retroactive classification of emails, Comey did say many emails were retroactively classified. But he also said that some emails were classified at the time \u2014 and Clinton and her aides should have been aware of that.\n\nHere\u2019s how Comey put it in his lengthy statement when he announced the completion of the investigation: \u201cAlthough we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d\n\nComey said \u201cseven e-mail chains concern matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending e-mails about those matters and receiving e-mails from others about the same matters.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton\u2019s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.\u201d He noted that \u201ceven if information is not marked \u2018classified\u2019 in an e-mail, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.\u201d\n\nIn her response to Wallace, Clinton at one point appeared to deflect responsibility to her aides: \u201cI relied on and had every reason to rely on the judgments of the professionals with whom I worked. And so, in retrospect, maybe some people are saying, well, among those 300 people, they made the wrong call.\u201d\n\nTestifying before Congress, Comey said it was possible Clinton was not \u201ctechnically sophisticated\u201d enough to understand what the classified markings meant. But he said a government official should be attentive to such a marking.\n\nAs we have seen repeatedly in Clinton\u2019s explanations of the email controversy, she relies on excessively technical and legalistic answers to explain her actions. While Comey did say there was no evidence she lied to the FBI, that is not the same as saying she told the truth to the American public \u2014 which was the point of Wallace\u2019s question. Comey has repeatedly not taken a stand on her public statements.\n\nAnd although Comey did say many emails were retroactively classified, he also said that there were some emails that were already classified that should not have been sent on an unclassified, private server. That\u2019s the uncomfortable truth that Clinton has trouble admitting.", "lang": "en"}
