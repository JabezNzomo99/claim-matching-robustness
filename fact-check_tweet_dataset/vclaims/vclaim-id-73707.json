(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe image in the Facebook post also appears on the homepage of the Kenosha church\u2019s website. The church was not burned during protests, according to its minister, the Rev. Erik David Carlson.\n\n\"Despite the fact that we cannot condone the violent response to injustice, we understand and appreciate the anger and frustration that fueled the events of last night,\" Carlson wrote in a message on the church\u2019s website. \"While we are relieved that our church home mostly survived the inferno in the lot next door, we affirm that we would rather lose 100 buildings than one more life to police violence.\"\n\nIn the photo that appears on Facebook, the fire behind the church\u2019s sign is burning a used-car dealership next door, not the church. Ultimately, the church sign in the photo burned, but the church itself \u2014 which is to the left of the sign in the image \u2014 was only singed on one side. Everything else appears in working order, Carlson told us.\n\n\"There is no indication the sign or the church were targets of the arsonists,\" Carlson said. He credited a couple of journalists who saw the fire in the car lot and realized it could spread to the church, dousing flames closest to the building using the church\u2019s rain barrels and piling dirt on sparks using snow shovels from a shed behind the building.\n\nThe Facebook post claims that Bradford Community Church \"is a Black church in a Black community with a BLM sign out front.\"\n\nThe church\u2019s sign did say \"Black Lives Matter,\" but Carlson, who is white, said \"we are far from a \u2018Black\u2019 church.\" The vast majority of its members \u2014 historically and now \u2014 are white.\n\nThe church is located in the city\u2019s historic downtown area. It\u2019s not really residential, Carlson said, though it is relatively close to what would be considered a Black neighborhood.\n\n\"But I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re in the middle of a Black community,\" he said. \"We\u2019re more in the commerce district.\"", "lang": "en"}
