It showed the inside of a passenger aircraft and a panicked scene. A baby is heard crying and people are wearing oxygen masks.\n\nMany of those who\n\nclaimed it was of the final moments of the\n\nplane. The footage was even made a\n\nBut does it really show the moments before the tragedy?\n\nOxygen masks drop when planes are at high altitude\n\ntook off at 8:38 am local time and crashed about six minutes later, according to\n\n, indicate that the highest altitude it reached was 8,600 feet (about 2,620 metres) above sea level.\n\nOxygen masks usually descend for passengers to use when the pressure of the cabin falls while the aircraft is at high altitude.\n\nDarren Olivier, a military analyst and the editor of the\n\n, told Africa Check that commercial aircraft are pressurised during flight. This pressure is in order to maintain a comfortable and breathable atmosphere when planes are flying at high altitudes such as 30,000 or 40,000 feet. Here, the air outside the plane is simply too thin to support consciousness.\n\n\u201cOxygen masks deploy automatically based on cabin altitude. For example, for the airbus A320, as far as I know, that altitude is 14,000 feet,\u201d Olivier said.\n\nHe said \u201c10,000 feet\u201d was \u201cconsidered a safe altitude where passengers can breathe normally even if the oxygen runs out\u201d.\n\nIn the six minutes Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737-800-MAX was in flight, it did not breach this \u201csafe\u201d altitude. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that oxygen masks would have been deployed for passengers \u2013 as shown in\n\nOne aisle or two aisles?\n\nour Twitter followers to crowdsource this fact-check.\n\nobserved that the aircraft in the video had two aisles. \u201cThe 737 Max is a single-aisle aircraft, the one on the video is two aisles, a widebody aircraft, possibly a 787 or Airbus A350,\u201d he\n\nalso suggested inconsistencies in time. \u201cThe video looks to have been shot at night and the tragic incident happened in the morning hours Ethiopian (EAT) time.\u201d\n\nIt is clear that the\n\nhas two aisles. The\n\nand therefore cannot be that plane.\n\nMany people shared the video out of heartbreak and compassion for the 157 passengers and crew who died on Sunday morning. But sharing unverified videos does little to help.", "lang": "en"}
