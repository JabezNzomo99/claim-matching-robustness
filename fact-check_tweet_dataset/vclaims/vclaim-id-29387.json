Lewis wrote in his book \u201cMere Christianity\u201d that \u201chumility isn\u2019t thinking less of yourself \u2013 it\u2019s thinking of yourself less.\u201d\n\nLewis did not author this statement, which appears to only date back to the 1990s.\n\nA writer and academic at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, Lewis was a convert to Christianity and an influential apologist for the religion. His writings are still widely read today, decades after his death. Lewis is perhaps best known for his novel series \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia,\u201d considered a classic of the fantasy genre.\n\nThough Lewis does discuss humility in his 1952 work \u201cMere Christianity,\u201d the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post does not appear in that book, nor in any of his other writings. \u201cI\u2019ve examined this quote and with absolute certainty report that Lewis did not write it,\u201d William O\u2019Flaherty, author of \u201cThe Misquotable C.S. Lewis,\u201d told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\nThe C.S. Lewis Foundation includes the statement in its list of quotes misattributed to Lewis.\n\nThe quote does appear in Christian pastor Rick Warren\u2018s popular book \u201cThe Purpose Driven Life,\u201d published in 2002. While he quotes Lewis several times in that book, Warren does not attribute this particular statement to him.\n\nA similar statement can also be found in the 1998 book \u201cThis Was Your Life! Preparing to Meet God Face to Face.\u201d The authors quote Lewis the very next sentence, which may have led some people to misattribute the quote.\n\nThe origin of the quote may actually date back some years earlier. According to etymologist Barry Popick, a variation appeared in a March 1990 edition of The Democrat and Chronicle, where American author Ken Blanchard is quoted as saying, \u201cDon\u2019t think less of yourself, just think of yourself less.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
