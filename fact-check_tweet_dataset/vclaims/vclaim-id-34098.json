Attempting to delink the CAA from the National Record of Citizenship (NRC), Modi claimed that his government never mentioned the NRC since his government came to power in 2014. Any implementation of the NRC was limited only to Assam post the Supreme Court directive, claimed Prime Minister Modi.\n\nBOOM looked through Modi's own speeches and statements made by Home Minister Amit Shah and found this claim to be false.\n\nNot only has Modi mentioned NRC before, during the campaign trail before the Lok Sabha elections this year, Union Minister for Home Affairs Amit Shah has also mentioned it multiple times at various occasions, especially in association with the Citizenship Amendment Bill (now an Act) [CAA].\n\n\n\nAt his more than 2-hour long speech on Sunday, Modi said,\n\n\n\nHis statement can be seen here.\n\nModi was attempting to distance the government from the NRC process in this mega rally, which was one of the biggest since the contentious CAA became an Act on November 12. More than 20 people have died in the nationwide agitations against the Act. \n\n\n\nOn two earlier occasions, Prime Minister Modi had said that the NRC will be implemented.\n\nFirst, he made this statement at a rally in Silchar in Assam on January 4, where he reiterates the coming of NRC.\n\nHe later goes on to acknowledge the pain that citizens have faced during the process, but credits their sacrifice towards putting the the NRC issue away for good. \n\n\n\nHis statement can be seen here.\n\nOn April 19 this year, in an interview with Times Now, Modi also criticised the non-implementation of the provisions of the Assam Accord by previous governments.\n\n(\"After the NRC, we go to know that the picture (of infiltrators) is one of concern, and since it is of concern, it must be discussed in the country. Is there any country in the world which is a hospice? One which does not have a register of its citizens?\") \n\n\n\nThis statement can be seen here.\n\nOn September 18, 2018, Sorbananda Sonowal attended a seminar on the NRC in New Delhi, where he did mention the Assam model of the NRC for the rest of the country.\n\n\"Asserting that infiltration cannot be allowed to go unchecked which otherwise could have disastrous consequences on social harmony and territorial integrity of the country, the chief minister reiterated that the NRC process in Assam can be a model to emulate across the country for tackling the problem of illegal migration. He also said that Draft NRC has come out through a legal process and the State and Central Governments are doing their constitutional duties under the directions of the Supreme Court to bring out a flawless NRC.\"\n\nThe press release can be seen here. \n\n\n\nThe BJP in its election manifesto this year, said that the BJP government would implement the NRC as a tool to combat illegal infiltration, citing an adverse cultural linguistic impact on population in parts of India. \n\n\n\nA snapshot of the BJP's manifesto can be used here.\n\nEarlier, BOOM highlighted five instances where Home Minister Amit Shah made it quite clear that the NRC will follow the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Bill in parliament. \n\n\n\nThis can be read below.\n\nAmong these, Shah said during a press conference on April 23: \n\n\n\n\"Understand the chronology. First the CAB will come, and after the CAB the NRC will come; not only for Bengal, but for the whole country\".\n\nA similar statement was also given to ABP News, where he reiterates the same process. \n\n\n\nThe NRC is a process that tabulates a list of Indians who could prove their own or their ancestors' presence to legal Indian citizenship before March 24, 1971. Failure to do so could render one to be declared a foreigner. 19 lakh people were off the NRC in Assam, many of who were Hindu. \n\n\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 was passed by Parliament and approved by President Ram Nath Kovind. The Act permits six non-Muslim religious minorities, who come to India as refugees fleeing religious persecution, expedited access to Indian citizenship. While opponents of the Act say that it is discriminatory, the government says that it is a humane piece of legislation for helpless refugees with nowhere else to go. A combination of NRC and the CAA is being touted as collectively being a ticket to non-Muslims' re-integration into Indian society.", "lang": "en"}
