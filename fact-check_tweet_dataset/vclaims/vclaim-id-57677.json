Greg Abbott has banned all travelers coming into Texas from Louisiana.\n\n\u201cIt just got REAL REAL,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nThere is no travel ban on people coming from Louisiana. The executive order requires that people traveling by car from Louisiana self-quarantine for 14 days upon entering Texas.\n\nAbbott expanded quarantine orders for travelers entering Texas on March 29 to include \u201cevery person who enters the State of Texas through roadways from Louisiana.\u201d The mandate, which went into effect on March 30, requires people traveling by car from Louisiana to self-quarantine for 14 days upon entry into Texas.\n\nThe same day that Abbott made the announcement, local journalist Jason Whitely tweeted out what he believed to be a summary of the expanded quarantine orders. That tweet was later screen grabbed and posted on Facebook.\n\n\u201c#BREAKING: Governor @GregAbbott_TX issues executive order banning people from traveling into Texas from Louisiana,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cState troopers will stop motorists. Commercial activity, emergency response or critical infrastructure responsibilities is okay.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no mention of a travel ban on travelers entering Texas from Louisiana in the governor\u2019s executive order. A spokesperson for Abbott\u2019s office confirmed to the Daily Caller in a phone interview that \u201cno ban on travel between the two states\u201d exists.\n\n\u201cUPDATE: *Travel from Louisiana to Texas is NOT banned,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAnyone entering by care must quarantine for 14-days.*\u201d (RELATED: Does This Video Show Military Vehicles Arriving In New York City During The Coronavirus Pandemic?)\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) will enforce the quarantine mandate, which requires travelers to provide a quarantine location and other information. But a DPS spokesperson has said that enforcement doesn\u2019t include checkpoints at the Texas-Louisiana border, according to local affiliate KHOU 11.\n\nTravel related to \u201ccommercial activity, military service, emergency response, health response, or critical-infrastructure functions\u201d are exempt from the mandatory quarantine, according to the executive order.", "lang": "en"}
