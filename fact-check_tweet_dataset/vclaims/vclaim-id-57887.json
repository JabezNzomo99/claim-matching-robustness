This is a clear treachery and betrayal of faith by the Russians as Russia has been an ally of the British-Americans, which she should not have done. Please take note of it and do what you consider proper and fit. Yours sincerely, Jawaharlal Nehru.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the link to the above post (archive).\n\nUpon further research, we found some of these posts from as early as 2016.\n\nIn the letter, we noticed that the name \u2018Attlee\u2019 is misspelt in two places. Moreover, the letter addresses Clement Attlee as the Prime Minister of England but he was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nThrough a keyword search, we found a video interview of historian Ramachandra Guha from 2016 who clarified that the letter in concern is not authentic and was a \u201cdubious claim by a witness seeking publicity before the Khosla Commission in 1970.\u201d\n\nWe also found another article by Business Standard that states multiple reasons for why the letter is unauthentic. It mentions that all circulated versions of the letter have lingual errors and that different publications have reported different versions of the fax.\n\nHence, this proves that the letter and the mention from the letter about Subhash Chandra Bose are inauthentic.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
