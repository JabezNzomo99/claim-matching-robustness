She notes that she and other activists were getting COVID-19 tested weekly, and that she had tested positive for the virus five weeks earlier.\n\nObispo discusses her experience at the hospital where she was treated, saying she received the necessary care, including daily vitamins and medication, along with four quality meals a day.\n\nMaduro accompanied the video with a message: \"The simple and heartfelt testimony of Norkis Obispo, a warrior from the [Venezuelan] Plains recovered from the Coronavirus, thanks to the treatments, care and care of all health personnel.\u201d\n\nThe video and the president\u2019s message are misleading, and misrepresent how the coronavirus outbreak is impacting Venezuela.\n\nJust two days after Maduro\u2019s tweet, members of the nursing staff at Dr. Egor Nucete Hospital launched a sit-down strike. They refused to further treat COVID-19 positive patients until they were guaranteed proper biosafety equipment and supplies, along with \u201cdecent and optimal working conditions\u201d to treat patients without putting themselves at risk.\n\n\"We do not have biosecurity equipment, in addition to this there is no water or medical supplies or medical equipment to protect our lives. All these conditions violate the rules and laws [of the country],\u201d they said, citing \u201cdeplorable conditions\u201d at the hospital.\n\nSince the pandemic hit Venezuela, experts and international organizations have expressed concern over the effect it would have on its already-crippled healthcare system. As Polygraph.info reported in late June, Maduro has consistently downplayed the outbreak in Venezuela.\n\nAlianza Rebelde Investiga (ARI), a Venezuelan news media collaborative, reported on June 7 that \"hospital equipment, medical personnel and provision of basic services are insufficient\u201d in the country\u2019s 47 hospitals designated to treat coronavirus patients. Only 57 percent of the hospitals have a continuous water supply, and 43 percent have insufficient or no protective gear \u2013 such as gowns, surgical and face masks \u2013 for doctors and nurses. The investigation also found that only 15 ambulances were in operation for the entire hospital network.\n\nVenezuela has relied heavily on humanitarian aid from allies like Turkey and China, and international organizations like the United Nations, to acquire PPE and other medical resources. However, such aid has not been sufficient to counter the consequences of a crippled infrastructure, power outages and a scarce water supply.\n\nIn the video, Obispo urges people to get tested if they have coronavirus symptoms, but widespread and reliable testing is also an issue in Venezuela.\n\nRafael Orihuela, a former Venezuelan minister of health, told the Voice of America that there are not enough labs for COVID-19 testing, even though more could be built (and were promised). \u201cIt seems that there is an attempt not to do so in order to keep [the figures] murky,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrently, we have only one that is in Caracas where the test is done and it takes three weeks to deliver the results.\u201d\n\nDuring the last week, international media have reported on how Venezuela\u2019s government is handling the pandemic, including deploying security forces and putting those who test positive in warehouses with sub-minimal living conditions.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Aug. 19 that Venezuelans who are returning to their country because of the pandemic \u2013 denounced as \u201cbioterrorists\" by Maduro \u2013 are being put into crowded rooms with limited protection, food and water, and \"held under military guard for weeks or months for coronavirus tests or treatment with unproven medications.\u201d\n\nIn cities like Maracaibo, the capital of Zulia state, police patrol streets looking for Venezuelans who returned home without official approval, the Times reported.\n\nIn early June, 20 people infected with the virus asked to be released from the University Hospital of Maracaibo because they had no food or water. The state's doctors\u2019 association has decried a lack of hospital beds and supplies, use of low-budget hotels to quarantine coronavirus patients and the limited use of face masks.\n\nBloomberg reported on August 24 that patients and doctors are avoiding being tested so as not to be sent to state-run quarantine centers. \u201cVenezuela was already very short on medical staff. People are afraid. Now patients arrive immediately needing intensive care because they lived with the disease at home until they just couldn\u2019t any longer,\u201d Maria Graciela Lopez, head of Venezuela\u2019s Society of Infectology, told the news agency. Some people are relying on the black market for tests, so they are not monitored by the government.\n\nOn June 1, Maduro\u2019s government and the opposition-led National Assembly, along with the Pan American Health Associations (PAHO), signed an agreement committing to work together to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. They also committed to create official channels for PAHO to help in fight the pandemic in Venezuela, by delivering assistance aimed at increasing diagnostic capacity, protecting health workers, responding to confirmed cases, increasing epidemiological surveillance and improving risk communication with the population.\n\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, as of August 23, Venezuela had recorded a total of 39,564 COVID-19 cases and 329 deaths. Although the rate of daily new cases has decreased over the past week, experts warn that rates of infection are growing at a pace greater than the testing capacity. This is likely leading to an \u201cartificial flattening of the contagion curve,\u201d a lawmaker and medical adviser to opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 told Reuters.", "lang": "en"}
