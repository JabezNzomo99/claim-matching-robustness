Tammy Baldwin spoke out for universal background checks -- that is, requiring them for every gun sale.\n\nThe Wisconsin Democrat said universal checks are supported by 97 percent of gun owners, a claim we rated Mostly True, based on the latest national polling of households that have guns.\n\nClearly, the checks -- the potential buyer shows identification, completes a federal form and goes through an instant criminal background check -- are not required for all gun sales.\n\nIndeed, under federal law, only federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run the checks.\n\nSo, what percentage of guns are sold without a background check?\n\nOn March 7, 2018, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock -- a possible Democratic contender for president in 2020 -- visited Milwaukee to raise money for Wisconsin Democrats.\n\nInterviewed by WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee, he touched briefly on guns, voicing support for universal background checks and saying:\n\n\"It makes no sense that a quarter of our guns are sold outside of the background checks.\"\n\nAfter the Florida school shooting, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" that \"40 percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks.\"\n\nBut that was wrong. PolitiFact Florida rated his statement False. So did the Washington Post Fact Checker and FactCheck.org.\n\nAll three agreed, and Sanders\u2019 staff essentially acknowledged, he was using an outdated statistic from a 1994 study.\n\nThe fact checks, and experts we contacted, instead cited a study authored by researchers from Northeastern and Harvard universities that was published in January 2017. They did an online survey, in 2015, of 1,613 adult gun owners.\n\nAmong gun owners who said they obtained their most recent gun within the two previous years:\n\u2022 22 percent overall said they obtained the guns without a background check. But that includes guns that were purchased or received in another way, such as through a gift or an inheritance.\n\u2022 13 percent who purchased firearms -- for example, from a friend or online -- said they had done so without a background check.\n\nThe lower figure applies here, given that Bullock\u2019s claim is about gun sales.\n\nBullock says: \"A quarter of our guns are sold outside of the background checks.\"\n\nThe latest study that surveyed gun owners on the topic found that, among gun owners who had acquired a gun in some way within the previous two years, 22 percent had done so without a background check.\n\nThat\u2019s close to Bullock\u2019s figure. But it takes into account people who acquired guns either by purchasing them, or by simply receiving them, for example as a gift.\n\nAmong those surveyed who had purchased a gun within the previous two years, only 13 percent said they had done so without a background check.\n\n\n\n Go here for a review of our other gun fact checks since Parkland.", "lang": "en"}
