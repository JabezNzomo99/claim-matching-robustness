The post urges people to \u201cshare this information as many times as possible as one can never know if the next victim is our dear one.\u201d The alleged notification has been circulated with an image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, suggesting that the initiative was started by this government. It has been shared by nearly 3,000 people.\n\nThe announcement is also widespread on Twitter, with users sharing it in different languages.\n\nAlt News looked further and found that the message has been circulating on social media since 2014, with different claims of which government started the initiative \u2013 Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Delhi among others.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe initiative was actually started by Mumbai police in March 2014 on the occasion of International Women\u2019s Day after the rape and murder of Hyderabad techie Esther Anuhya. The helpline number was a joint venture between Mumbai police and MTNL. \u201cUnder \u2018Travel Safe When Alone\u2019 initiative, any women before taking an auto rickshaw or taxi could message the registration number of the vehicle to a dedicated helpline number 9969777888,\u201d reads a report by The Indian Express.\u201cPolice will keep the track of the vehicles that the woman is taking and would get her location through GPS,\u201d Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria was quoted in the article. However, the number has been circulating on social media with altered narratives ever since it was launched.\n\nBoth Delhi and Bengaluru police had debunked the false claims in 2016.\n\nAs the claim is still viral, Bengaluru police clarified again in May 2018 that no such protocol exists.\n\nMoreover, using PM Modi\u2019s photograph is immaterial because the initiative was started in Maharashtra in March 2014 \u2013 when Modi was neither the state\u2019s Chief Minister nor the country\u2019s Prime Minister.\n\nAlt News sent a message on the number and we received a reply saying \u2013 \u201cThanks for your Information. CALL 100 if any EMERGENCY. \u2014 Mumbai Police. In your Service- MTNL\u201d. However, the reply was auto-generated and the number no longer functions. A March 2017 report by Mid-Day says that the initiative was shut due to poor response from women.\n\nSM Hoax Slayer also debunked the rumours floating on social media last year, adding that the helpline number was shut down.\n\nA common proclivity of fake news purveyors is to change narratives to complement their propaganda. Earlier, a fake message of a \u20181098\u2019 service started by PM Modi was viral on social media. It claimed that calling on that \u201cchild helpline\u201d number will enable people to distribute their leftover food to needy children. Any viral message circulating on Whatsapp or other social media platforms should be taken with a tinge of doubt and cross-checked for facts.", "lang": "en"}
