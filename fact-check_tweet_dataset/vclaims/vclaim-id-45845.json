The CDC has recommended since early April that everyone should wear face coverings in public.\n\nThe image, posted on April 30, appears to show a screen grab of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\u2019s website, with a note about the CDC\u2019s guidance on wearing face masks during the coronavirus pandemic circled at the bottom.\n\n\u201cPlease note: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not recommend that people who are healthy wear facemasks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19,\u201d reads the circled text. \u201cFacemasks should be worn by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others.\u201d\n\nThat guidance was outdated when the image was posted on Facebook, and it remains so at the time of publication. (RELATED: Viral Image Gives Inaccurate Instructions For Wearing Surgical Masks)\n\nThe CDC issued new guidelines on April 3 that recommend everyone wear face coverings \u201cin public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\u201d Prior to April 3, the CDC had advised that people exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 or under investigation for having the virus should wear face coverings, not those who are healthy.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh Medical Center website has since been updated to reflect the change in the CDC\u2019s guidance.", "lang": "en"}
