He specifically cited Radio Svoboda (Radio Liberty), the Russian language service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which is funded by the U.S. Congress.\n\nThere is no evidence that Radio Svoboda or U.S. government-funded Voice of America made such a specific claim in its coverage of the Russian presidential election. RFE/RL has pointed out that the Kremlin is determined to achieve high turnout, but this is a well-established fact that has been reported by many outlets.\n\nOne recent Radio Svoboda story detailed the authorities\u2019 efforts to ensure voter turnout, but did not include anything resembling Klimov\u2019s claims. President Putin, himself, expressed concern about low voter turnout, calling the situation \u201ctough and difficult\u201d following a record lower percentage of voter turnout in 2016\u2019s State Duma elections.\n\nMoreover, Radio Svoboda has provided balanced coverage on Russia affairs, frequently featuring commentators like Sergei Markov, a professor of political science at Moscow\u2019s State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and an outspoken Putin supporter.\n\nKlimov did not point to any specific story or cite any sources to support his claim. Thus, his claim about a concerted campaign by Radio Svoboda or other U.S. state media to declare the upcoming Russian presidential elections illegitimate based on turnout appears to be unfounded.", "lang": "en"}
