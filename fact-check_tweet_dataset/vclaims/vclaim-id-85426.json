And one of the reasons you\u2019ve seen us repeal certain regulations already is we think that the previous administration didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nThe broadest requirement is in Executive Order 12866, which states that agencies are to \u201cassess both the costs and the benefits of the intended regulation and, recognizing that some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify, propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs.\u201d OMB Circular A-4 lays out how agencies are to do cost-benefit analysis for major rules (such as those with a $100 million annual impact on the economy). But both the EO and the Circular have phrases like \u201cwhere feasible\u201d and \u201cto the extent permitted by law.\u201d\n\nSo, basically, these requirements are not legally binding. However, there are a few cases, such as Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2015, in which the courts have struck down regulations for an agency\u2019s failure to consider costs.\n\nMore than half of the major rules issued during this period were transfer rules (such as setting reimbursement and prospective payment levels for Medicare and Medicaid), which primarily involve federal funds flowing to beneficiaries \u2014 not rules involving traditional regulatory costs and benefits. For the remaining non-transfer rules issued during this period, agencies provided monetized estimates of both costs and benefits in 51 percent of the cases.\n\nIndeed, contrary to Mulvaney\u2019s claim, federal agencies were much more likely to only estimate costs (54 rules) than to only estimate benefits (16 rules). In the 16 rules where only benefits were estimated, 15 of them were Interior Department migratory bird hunting rules (e.g., setting duck seasons). The one remaining rule involved federal agency disbursement practices.\n\nIn response to a query, Mulvaney\u2019s staff walked back his statement a bit. \u201cThere are relatively few statutes that call for a benefit-cost analysis as explicitly as OMB\u2019s Executive Orders,\u201d an official acknowledged. But the official added: \u201cThere have been many high-profile rules of the previous Administration halted or overturned by the courts or Congress, including the Clean Water Act Jurisdictional rule, the Department of Labor\u2019s so called Fair Pay rule that has since been overturned under the congressional Review Act, and the Clean Power Plan. We believe that developing a better analysis would have led to a better and more justified outcome for these rules, and we intend to do just that.\u201d\n\nIn any case, the three cases cited by the official did not involve problems with an agency\u2019s cost analysis. The \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d rule was challenged over the reach of federal regulations on wetlands and waterways, not regulatory costs and benefits. The \u201cFair Pay\u201d rule was stopped by a court order, and later overturned by Congress using the congressional Review Act \u2014 not because of inadequate consideration of costs, but because of concerns that contractors would have to \u201cpublicly disclose mere accusations of labor law violations that have not been fully adjudicated.\u201d Similarly, the Clean Power Plan was not challenged over inadequate consideration of costs but on legal, constitutional and procedural grounds.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s sweeping claim is not supported. Instead of ignoring costs, the Obama administration clearly considered the cost side of the equation in a majority of the rules. Mulvaney may believe that the Obama administration had an incomplete or inadequate consideration of the costs \u2014 what he called at one point \u201cfudging the analysis\u201d of costs \u2014 but that\u2019s different from suggesting a complete refusal to consider costs. Indeed, the career people at the Office of Management and Budget who now work for Mulvaney probably worked on these costs estimates, so he might consider asking them what they did.", "lang": "en"}
