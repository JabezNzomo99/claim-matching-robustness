AdvaMed\u2019s electronic survey of its members reaffirmed the group\u2019s earlier findings of job losses in the industry in 2013 (the first year of the tax) and the years leading up to it.\n\nThe survey found that there were 18,500 job losses in the industry between 2010 and 2014. (The tax was implemented in 2013.) It also found that the industry will forgo hiring about 20,500 employees over the next five years. Using the combination of jobs reportedly lost and jobs that may not be created, the survey predicts that the tax will result in 39,000 fewer industry jobs.\n\nA January Emergo Group survey asked 685 senior managers at U.S. medical device companies about the effect of the tax. More than one response was allowed per company, and the respondents do not provide their company name. Using e-mail addresses, Emergo Group found at least 440 unique company domain names (or 440 unique companies). An additional 130 used free e-mail domains and could indicate unique companies, according to Emergo.\n\nRespondents represented a cross-section of company sizes: 22 percent were from companies with one to nine employees; 37 percent were from those with 10 to 49 employees; 22 percent were from those with 50 to 240 employees; and 18 percent were from those with 250-plus employees. More than 80 percent of medical device companies have fewer than 50 employees, according to Emergo.\n\nAbout 14 percent of respondents said they cut staff to make up for the medical device tax, and nearly 57 percent said they did not make any significant changes in response. Larger companies were more likely to use staff reduction to cut costs, compared with smaller companies, which could not afford to do so.\n\nBut most companies in the U.S. medical device industry are small businesses whose assets are less than $1 million, according to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service (Table 1). In contrast, the top 1 percent of firms by asset size account for the majority of revenue. So the companies in the AdvaMed study may comprise a larger share of the industry revenue but a small portion of the actual industry.\n\nThe CRS report, updated in January, estimated between 0.01 percent and 0.2 percent of industry jobs being lost as a result of the tax. (AdvaMed said the CRS findings are \u201cseriously flawed\u2026ignore the most recent data on the actual as opposed to the hypothetical impact of the tax, and fail to acknowledge critical facts about the industry and the tax.\u201d The group also criticized a similar, earlier version of the CRS report.)\n\n\u201cThe BLS data reflects total employment in the industry, which is affected by a whole host of commercial factors other than the device tax. Our survey asked for layoffs specifically due to the device tax. At a time when the industry was impacted first by the recession and then by the recovery, aggregate figures don\u2019t really tell you anything about the device tax impact,\u201d AdvaMed said in a statement.\n\nScalise said the tax \u201chas led\u201d to more than 30,000 jobs being lost, which inaccurately described the AdvaMed survey results. If you believe the survey, 18,500 jobs have been lost from 2010 to 2014; you get to 30,000 only by adding in jobs that respondents supposedly expect to forgo over the next five years.\n\nMoreover, there are strong reasons to be wary of the AdvaMed research. A broader survey found that smaller companies \u2014 which make up the majority of the industry in the United States \u2014 have not cut jobs in response to the tax. About 18 percent to 25 percent of the larger companies (with more than 50 employees) had cut staff, but the majority of the industry did not make any significant changes related to the tax.", "lang": "en"}
