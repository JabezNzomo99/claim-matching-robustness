The attendance numbers were disappointing for the Trump campaign, to say the least, as they had boasted in the days leading up to the event that they had received more than a million RSVPs for the event.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s defenders attempted to explain away the rally\u2019s poor attendance, some social media users attempted to flat out deny that the event was poorly attended by claiming that the media was lying about attendance figures, and by circulating photographs that they claimed showed how the arena was actually packed during the event.\n\nBelow is one such posting:\n\nThis appears to be a genuine photograph from a Trump rally \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t taken at the Tulsa rally in June 2020. This image appears to have been taken at a November 2019 Trump rally at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida.\n\nThe BOK Center has the capacity for 19,000 people. According to the Tulsa Fire Department, the arena was less than half full during Trump\u2019s rally, with an attendance of 6,200 people.\n\nWhile the above-displayed post claims that the viral images of empty seats at Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally were taken before the event started, there are plenty of images showing these empty seats while Trump was on stage:\n\nTim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump reelection campaign, disputed the fire department\u2019s count, arguing that there were closer to 12,000 people at the rally. Regardless, the above-displayed image was not taken at the BOK Center in Tulsa in June 2020.\n\nThe image in the viral Facebook post appears to show the scene at President Trump\u2019s rally at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida in November 2019. While it\u2019s difficult to read, the words \u201cFlorida Welcomes\u201d seem to be written at the top of the jumbotron. Photographs and videos from this rally appear to show the same blue banner wrapped around the arena, the same division and color of seats, the same jumbotron, and the same setup for the stage as seen in the viral image.\n\nFurthermore, shortly after this image went viral, Facebook user Sheri Chaires posted a second image to Facebook. This image clearly showed Trump\u2019s November 2019 rally at the BB&T Center \u2014 it was the same image shared by the official Florida GOP Twitter account \u2014 along with the caption, \u201cthis is how we protest\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
