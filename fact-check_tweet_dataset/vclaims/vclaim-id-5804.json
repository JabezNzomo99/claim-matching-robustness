Comments include, \u201cThings are getting juicy !! These sick people need to go !!!!\u201d and \u201cit's hard for them to fathom that their celebrity heroes are not what they expected. The truth is what we need more of!\u201d\n\nThe comments refer to \u201cPizzagate\u201d, a conspiracy theory which stemmed from a fake online report that a Washington DC pizza restaurant was cover for a child sex trafficking ring ( here ). The New York Times explains the conspiracy theory in depth here .\n\nSome social media users are reviving these theories in the run up to the November election. Reuters recently debunked a viral conspiracy involving the furniture maker Wayfair, which was accused of trafficking children in their closets ( here ), as well as other conspiracy claims involving Hanks, DeGeneres and Winfrey ( here , here , here , and here ).\n\nTom Hanks did recently get issued a Greek passport but not because of a conspiracy theory link.\n\nIn late July, Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson became honorary Greek citizens because of their work spreading awareness of the 2018 fires that devastated Greece\u2019s Attica region and their promotion of Greek tourism through their frequent trips to Antiparos, where the family owns a house ( here , here ). Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis shared a photograph with the couple on his Instagram page on July 26 here .\n\nRita Wilson also has Greek heritage. Her mother was Greek and she was raised Greek Orthodox ( here , here ).\n\nReuters Fact Check recently debunked claims that Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 show had been cancelled here .\n\nThe suggestion that Ellen\u2019s show is under investigation likely stems from recent allegations of a toxic work culture at the popular talk show. A Buzzfeed report from mid-July included damning allegations from former employees, blasting the show for not being true to Ellen\u2019s \u201cbe kind\u201d mantra ( here ).\n\nOn July 30, DeGeneres sent an emotional message to the staff of her television talk show saying she was taking steps to improve the culture on set following accusations of a hostile working environment. The email followed an internal investigation by Warner Bros. Television, which produces \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d of complaints ranging from bullying to racism among production staff.\n\nWarner Bros. Television said in a statement that although \u201cnot all of the allegations were corroborated, we are disappointed that the primary findings of the investigation indicated some deficiencies related to the show\u2019s day-to-day management.\u201d It said several staffing changes and other measures were being implemented, but did not give details ( here ).\n\nWhile DeGeneres\u2019 show was investigated by Warner Bros. Television because of allegations of a toxic work culture by former employees, Facebook posts and comments implying or linking this to the Pizzagate conspiracy are unfounded.\n\nTo claim Oprah Winfrey\u2019s magazine is ending is misleading. The billionaire\u2019s iconic magazine, O, recently announced a halt to print editions only ( to.pbs.org/30unkfT ) After 20 years of publication, Hearst, which publishes the magazine, told PBS it would largely end print publishing in December 2020 to become \u201cmore digitally-centric.\u201d\n\nIt is not unusual for publications to shift to digital platforms as audiences move increasingly online ( here ).\n\nPartly false. Winfrey\u2019s magazine is not cancelled but transitioning from print to digital-only. Warner Bros. is investigating claims of \u201ctoxic work culture\u201d at DeGeneres\u2019 show and Tom Hanks did receive honorary Greek citizenship. However, these events are not connected to a debunked conspiracy theory.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
