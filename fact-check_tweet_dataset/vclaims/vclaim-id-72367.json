Harambe\u2019s death sparked thousands of social media posts or memes memorializing his death.\n\n\"The Legend Of Harambe Continues As The Dead Gorilla Received Over 15,000 Votes For President,\" reads a Nov. 9 headline from Coed, an online entertainment magazine.\n\nA post from 9GAG got over 79,000 reactions on Facebook.\n\nAnd of course there were the social media posts:\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible a handful of people voted for Harambe (see here), the stories that Harambe received thousands of votes \u2014 which ranges between 11,000 and 15,000 depending on the story \u2014 are not based on fact.\n\nWrite-in votes for Harambe would be treated like provisional or absentee ballots, meaning they wouldn\u2019t be counted until after all the other votes, which takes weeks. We\u2019re still counting votes in California, for instance.\n\nSeeing as these Harambe stories popped up immediately after the election, there\u2019s no way they were based on real data.\n\nPlus, every state decides on their own requirements for write-in candidates, so not all votes for Harambe would count depending on the state.\n\nMore than 30 states require a write-in candidate to file paperwork in order to be an official candidate and at least eight states don\u2019t even allow write-in candidates. The remaining states have no-filing requirements.\n\nHow many of these write-in votes actually get counted? Well, in 2012, 136,040 write-in votes were counted, which is .11-percent of the total votes, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe day after the presidential election, bloggers took to social media to share stories claiming Harambe received thousands of votes in this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nMost of those stories were written the day after the election, and any write-in votes for Harambe wouldn\u2019t have been counted. Moreover, more than half of states require write-in candidates file paperwork in advance of the election, while another nine don\u2019t even permit write-in candidates.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
