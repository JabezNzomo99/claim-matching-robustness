The most recent cycle, which began in late 2008, peaked with sunspots in April 2014 and then steadily decreased until reaching a \"solar minimum\" \u2014 or a period with zero sunspots \u2014 in late 2019 and 2020. That means, yes, by spring 2020, solar activity had reached a so-called \"lockdown,\" or solar minimum.\n\nIn mid-May 2020, as people worldwide remained quarantined to limit the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, social media posts claimed not only were humans on Earth sheltering-in-place during the pandemic, but our life source \u2014 the sun \u2014 had gone on \u201clockdown,\u201d too.\n\nRecirculating sensational headlines on the concept \u2014 including the New York Post\u2019s May 14 article \u201cThe sun has entered a \u2018lockdown\u2019 period, which could cause freezing weather, famine\u201c \u2014 numerous people reached out to Snopes to investigate the validity of the claim: that the power of our solar system\u2019s star had decreased to the point that life on Earth would be threatened by famine, earthquakes, and freezing temperatures.\n\nFirst, we considered the definitions of key terms in helioseismology (the study of the sun) to make sense of the claim.\n\nPer astronomers\u2019 research over centuries, the sun generates powerful magnetic forces that are constantly changing, affecting the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and X-rays from the ball of gas that illuminates Earth. In areas of the star where the magnetic fields are particularly strong \u2014 thus restricting some heat from the sun\u2019s core from reaching its surface \u2014 dark spots appear, or what astronomers call sunspots. In other words, sunspots are places on the sun that are cooler than other areas. Sarah Scoles, a writer for the peer-reviewed Science Magazine, of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, wrote in 2019:\n\nIn contrast, flashes of light on the star\u2019s surface occur when magnetic fields tangle or cross each other, causing a sudden explosion of energy \u2014 a phenomenon astronomers call solar flares.\n\nAll of these factors \u2014 the number of sunspots, their locations, and the intensity of solar flares, etc. \u2014 are known as solar activity, which, like Scoles pointed out, fluctuates on a relatively predictable cycle every 11 years or so. Astronomers measure this 11-year timeframe, the sun cycle, in two major phases: when sunspots gradually increase over roughly five or six years, peaking for a solar maximum, and when sunspots diminish over the next approximately five or six years until there are few or zero sunspots, called a solar minimum. NASA writes:\n\nIn late 2008, the sun began its 24th solar cycle since scientists began taking accurate measurements of solar activity. The cycle\u2019s solar maximum, or when the sun was at its most active state with its highest level of sunspots, occurred in April 2014, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). And from that point on, the number of sunspots decreased until late 2019, when the sun had zero sunspots, or reached a solar minimum.\n\nAs of May 2020, the sun remained at a solar minimum, which meant one facet of the claim \u2014 that the sun had entered a so-called \u201clockdown\u201d period, or solar minimum, by spring 2020 \u2014 was true. Dr. Tony Phillips, a former NASA researcher who now runs a daily website with astronomy updates for scientists, said in a May 19, 2020, email to Snopes that scientists expected the latest phase to last through much, if not all, of 2020.\n\nFor solar scientists like him, the phases in the sun cycle are important because they can change how satellites or natural debris orbit the Earth; different periods can also intensify cosmic rays and slightly dim the brightness of the sun\u2019s rays.\n\nWith little or zero sunspots on the star\u2019s surface, there\u2019s greater likelihood of long-lived coronal holes, which are low-energy regions in the outermost part of the sun\u2019s atmosphere where magnetic forces open up and allow streams of solar particles to escape the star \u2014 and those flows of solar wind can cause space weather effects if, or when, they hit Earth\u2019s magnetic field, according to NASA. In a 2017 article about the upcoming solar minimum in 2019 and 2020, NASA said:\n\nFurthermore, in other periods of the solar cycle, the star\u2019s ultraviolet radiation heats up the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in a way that causes friction for anything hovering and orbiting the globe. That friction causes what scientists call \u201cdrag,\u201d a phenomenon that prevents natural and manmade space debris from reaching low-orbiting rings closest to the Earth\u2019s surface. But during a solar minimum, the NASA article stated, \u201cthis natural heating mechanism subsides,\u201d adding:\n\nThat means it is accurate to say solar minimums can affect space weather, though the impacts remain at the atmospheric level.\n\nNext, to fully investigate the claim, we looked for any indication from scientists that the latest solar minimum \u2014 or the 25th sun cycle \u2014 was forecasted to affect humans in ways that most cycles in modern history had not: by causing low-crop production, earthquakes, and freezing weather.\n\nAccording to a panel of scientists sponsored by NOAA and NASA that makes such projections, as of April 2019, the upcoming roughly 11-year sun cycle (the 25th) was expected to \u201clikely be weak\u201d compared to others in modern history, yet similar to the previous cycle (the 24th) in terms of its number of sunspots and how they pendulate over time. NASA released the following graphic to help people visualize the prediction:\n\nThat means, as of this writing, astronomers were not predicting any catastrophic damages as a result of the 2019-2020 solar minimum. Phillips said:\n\nSince the start of astronomers\u2019 research into the sun\u2019s patterns, it has always produced sunspots after a solar minimum, even after the 17th Century\u2019s Maunder Minimum, or \u201cprolonged sunspot minimum,\u201d from 1645 to 1715, when sunspots were exceedingly rare for about 70 years. \u201cHowever, there is no evidence that the sun is currently \u2018stuck\u2019,\u201d Phillips said of the 2020 claim. \u201cOn the contrary, we are already starting to see the first sunspots of the next solar cycle. By the end of this year, we will probably be on the up-swing again.\u201d\n\nLastly, to complete our examination, we looked at where the concerns about the sun had originated; the New York Post\u2019s article was a recycled report by the British tabloid newspaper, The Sun, which appeared to have been the first publication to dub what is a normal occurrence in the sun\u2019s 11-year cycle a \u201clockdown\u201d without any specific attribution. The tabloid stated declaratively in the report\u2019s first paragraph:\n\nDespite the plurality of that tagline (\u201cscientists say\u201d), The Sun\u2019s story appeared to have been based on just one source: Phillips. The tabloid article quotes him directly, giving readers the assumption that he talked directly to writers of the report and shared comments to support the sensationalist headline and first paragraph.\n\nBut in his email to Snopes, Phillips set the record straight: He did not provide an interview to The Sun and, instead, he said its writers used statements on his website, Spaceweather.com, under the misleading pretense that the solar minimum would cause catastrophic effects. Of the tabloid article, the astronomer said:\n\nIn sum, given the sensational, inaccurate news reporting that spurred the claim, the fact that solar minimums impact space weather but do not typically cause catastrophic impacts for humans on Earth \u2014 as well as the prediction by scientists that the 2019-2020 solar minimum would be similar to the last one \u2014 we rate this claim \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
