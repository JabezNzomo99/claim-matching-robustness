The Always marketing team replied with a comment that Saunders, 18, posted on Twitter, reading: \u2018We are glad to inform you that as of December we will use a wrapper design without the feminine symbol.\u2019 The message stated that sanitary towels with the new packaging would hit the stores by January 2020 and added: \u2018We are absolutely grateful for having people like you voicing their opinions.\u2019\n\nIn addition to claiming that the same \u201ctransgender lobby\u201d had \u201cforced\u201d Procter & Gamble \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest consumer-products companies \u2014 to make the change, the Daily Mail used the words \u201ckowtow\u201d and \u201ccave-in\u201d to describe the packaging decision.\n\nSimilar articles were published by the U.K. tabloid The Sun and the right-leaning U.S. websites Daily Wire and PJ Media, all of which also claimed the company had been \u201cforced\u201d to remove the Venus symbol by trans activists or the \u201ctransgender lobby.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for the Always brand did tell Saunders of their intention to remove the female Venus symbol from menstruation products beginning in December 2019 and did indicate the decision had been influenced, at least in part, by the concerns expressed by some trans people. That position was broadly reiterated by a company spokesperson in a statement to Snopes.\n\nHowever, it was misleading and sensationalist to claim the company had been \u201cforced\u201d into taking the action they took. The available facts simply do not support that characterization.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when Always first added the Venus symbol to the packaging of their menstruation products, but Twitter users in the U.S. and U.K. (likely among other countries) first began to raise concerns about it in March 2019:\n\nThose concerns and requests persisted over the course of the summer and into the fall of 2019. The tweets were strikingly civil, respectful, and assertive in tone, rather than threatening or intimidating, as were the responses from the Always brand\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nOn 16 October, activist Ben Saunders tweeted out a screenshot of an email from \u201cThe Always Team\u201d at Procter & Gamble. Saunders\u2019 account has been set to protected, but we have been able to capture the tweet, as shown below. The company confirmed the email\u2019s authenticity to Snopes. In the email, which can be read in full here, a person named Sheryl wrote:\n\nI wanted to come back to you regarding your message about the Always wrappers\u2019 design with the female symbol on it you sent 18/06/2019. We listened to you and our marketing team worked [up] a solution! We are glad to inform you that as of December we will use a new wrapper design without the feminine symbol. Please just be aware that you might still find products with the old wrapper design in the stores for some weeks after December, as the distribution of the new packages might take some time \u2014 the new designs should be in store Jan/Feb 2020. We are absolutely grateful for having people like you voicing their opinions. Thank you for contacting us, your comments help us improve every day!\n\nA spokesperson for Procter & Gamble told Snopes the Venus symbol would be removed from menstruation products in \u201cmultiple markets at various dates,\u201d and confirmed this process would begin in early 2020. The statement read:\n\nFor over 35 years, Always has championed girls and women, and we will continue to do so. We\u2019re also committed to diversity and inclusion, and are on a continual journey to understand the needs of all of our consumers. We routinely assess our products, packaging and designs, taking into account consumer feedback to ensure we are meeting the needs of everyone who uses our products. After hearing from many people, we recognized that not everyone who has a period and needs to use a pad, identifies as female. To ensure that anyone who needs to use a period product feels comfortable with Always, we\u2019re adjusting our pad wrapper design as part of our next round of product changes. As a global brand, our design updates will be adapted by multiple markets at various dates beginning in January/February 2020.\n\nSaunders\u2019 tweet prompted multiple news reports and an angry response from some women and feminists, who objected to the planned removal of the Venus symbol. The hashtag #BoycottAlways appeared on Twitter in October, a more aggressive and inherently coercive form of dissent than had ever emerged on social media among those trans activists who had objected to the inclusion of the symbol beginning in March.\n\nProcter & Gamble\u2019s decision to introduce the Venus symbol certainly prompted a concerned response among trans activists (especially trans men) in 2019, and some of those activists expressed those concerns and requests to the company in no uncertain terms. However, the proverbial \u201cangry backlash,\u201d including online calls for a boycott of Always \u2014 an inherently coercive form of opposition \u2014 only came in October, when news emerged that the company would be removing the symbol.\n\nCompanies make marketing and public relations decisions for various reasons, and such choices are typically arrived at after careful consideration of multiple strategic, commercial, financial, ethical, and legal factors. Requests and appeals such as those made by Saunders and other trans activists certainly appear to have played a role in Procter & Gamble\u2019s decision, based on the company\u2019s own statement.\n\nHowever, it is a gross distortion of the actual sequence of events to claim that those activists, or an ill-defined \u201ctransgender lobby,\u201d somehow forced the company into its U-turn on the Venus symbol. They did not.", "lang": "en"}
