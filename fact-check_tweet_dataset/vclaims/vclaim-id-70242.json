Jason Smith, a Republican, who was recent", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-70242", "url": "http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2018/nov/19/jason-smith/rep-jason-smith-not-far-small-business-job-creatio/", "vclaim": "In a Nov. 9 Twitter post, after receiving an award from the National Federation of Independent Business, Smith said that \"in fact 7 out of 10 new jobs in America are created by small businesses.\"\n\nPolitiFact Missouri verified a similar statement by Sen. Claire McCaskill in 2017, except she claimed that it was two out of three new jobs.\n\nFor background, a small business, as defined by the government, is a business that employs fewer than 500 people. As of 2013, according to the Small Business Administration, there were 28.8 million U.S. small businesses.\n\nAs of how many jobs small businesses created, the past fact-check cited a Small Business Administration article saying \"small businesses provide 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of all net new jobs since the 1970s.\" That\u2019s a bit lower than what Smith cited.\n\nTo understand where that \"seven out of 10\" statistic came from, we reached out to Smith\u2019s office for evidence. Joey Brown, his communications director, pointed to two files from the Small Business Administration. Those two cited close to a 66 percent net new job creation.\n\nAfter all the searching, we went straight to the source itself for the most recent data \u2013 the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes annual gross job gains and losses based on firm size.\n\nIt measures firm size in two ways: base size (the size of a business at the start of a year) and average size (the average between the sizes at the beginning and end of the year). The reason for this split is that the size of a business or firm isn\u2019t static, said BLS economist Sadeghi Akbar.\n\n\"If a business grows from five to 100 employees in a year, what size do you take?\" he said. \"A lot of research has shown that average sizing is the least biased when assigning size to a company.\"\n\nTherefore, using the average-sizing data, we calculated how many net new jobs small businesses have created from 1994 to 2017 compared to big businesses. The result: around two out of every three.\n\nWhen we calculated using only job gains and ignored any job losses since 1994, the number came to around 70 percent \u2014 closer to what Smith said. Even from calculating with data from just 2017, it was also around 70 percent of all new jobs.\n\nBased on our calculations, he is correct for job gains. Factoring in job losses, as is standard with most economic measurements, would put the statistic closer to two out of every three new jobs.", "lang": "en"}
