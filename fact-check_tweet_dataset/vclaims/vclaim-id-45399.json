Floyd, an unarmed Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after a Minneapolis police officer held him down and kneeled on his neck. Protests around the country against police brutality followed, with some people carrying posters with Floyd\u2019s face to commemorate him.\n\nIn early June, social media users stumbled upon an Obama Foundation tweet dated May 17 that featured a photograph of a poster with Floyd\u2019s face on it. They questioned how the photo could have been shared days before Floyd\u2019s death and how a Twitter post allegedly could be edited retroactively:\n\nThe Hal Turner Radio Show, a far-right program, said about this and some other tweets that featured the same image, \u201cSomething stinks here.\u201d Some social media users speculated that the foundation somehow knew in advance that Floyd would die.\n\nThis rumor has no truth to it. The Obama Foundation\u2019s tweets shared links to its website, Obama.org. The preview image for that page updates dynamically on Twitter when the platform\u2019s web crawlers (bots) re-index (restructure the website data for) the preview image for the website every week.\n\nIn other words, at a certain point following Floyd\u2019s death the foundation changed the Twitter Card image for the website, which retroactively updated the image on past tweets. A Twitter spokesperson told Snopes that the image shown in the card updates when the foundation updates the data used to generate the card. The group did not edit the tweet, according to the spokesperson, but may have changed the data associated with the link. This is the image shared on May 16, in a screenshot:\n\nWe reached out to the Obama Foundation to ask about the photo on June 8. On June 9, the image from the May 16 post had been changed to the foundation\u2019s logo:\n\nAn Obama Foundation spokesperson confirmed for us that the rumor is false, and that the preview image for Obama.org updates dynamically based on information set in the link. The photograph of the poster with Floyd\u2019s face on it was taken on May 30, 2020, according to the foundation, and was first used on the site on May 31.\n\nWe therefore rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
