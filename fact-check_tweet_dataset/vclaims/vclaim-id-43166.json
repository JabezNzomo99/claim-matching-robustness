The latest example focuses on the nomenclature of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.\n\n\u201cHate to break this to all of the morons who call themselves journalists,\u201d claims a March 23 post. \u201cCOVID literally stands for \u2018Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease\u2019 and the number 19 is due to this being the 19th virus to come out of China.\u201d\n\nThat is incorrect, however. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Feb. 11 that COVID-19 stands for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019,\u201d referring to the year the virus was first detected.

And I will spell it: C-O-V-I-D hyphen one nine,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, at a Feb. 11 press conference. \u201c\u2018CO,\u2019 C-O, stands for \u2018corona,\u2019 V-I stands for \u2018virus,\u2019 \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018disease,\u2019 so \u2018COVID.'\u201d\n\nWHO guidelines on \u201cBest Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases\u201d state that disease names may not include geographic locations, people\u2019s names, animal species or groups of people, among categories. The naming guidelines aim to prevent any potential negative affiliation with the disease.\n\nThe post appears to reference President Donald Trump\u2019s usage of the term \u201cChinese virus\u201d when referring to the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, a move that some have called racist and xenophobic. His defense for using the terms is that the virus \u201ccomes from China, that\u2019s why,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nSome Asian Americans have reported being the targets of verbal and physical harassment since the coronavirus pandemic started, according to CBS News.", "lang": "en"}
