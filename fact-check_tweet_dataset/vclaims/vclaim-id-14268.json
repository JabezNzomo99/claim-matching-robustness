We first checked the same graphic back in July 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s based on government analysis, produced in January 2018, of three fairly broad possible post-Brexit trade scenarios with the EU. The analysis compares how each deal might affect the economy.\n\nNot only is this analysis now over a year old, the graphic\u2019s reporting of it is highly misleading. For a start, the government report explicitly stated that it was based on hypothetical modelling and should not be used to make economic forecasts for each trade deal. This means it can\u2019t be used\u2014as the graphic does\u2014to estimate the future size of GDP, or number of jobs.\n\nEven if we ignore this, most of the figures reported by the graphic were still incorrect. The GDP figures were roughly accurate at the time, but the phrasing may have been confusing\u2014the government analysis still expected GDP to grow in each scenario, just more slowly. So \u201c8% lower GDP\u201d under \u201cno deal\u201d meant GDP would still have grown, but more slowly than on the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s (OBR) latest economic forecasts at the time, over a fifteen year period.\n\nThe \u201cless per year\u201d figures were wrong, as they referred to how much less the economy might grow by over fifteen years, not every year. And there was no evidence for the estimated job losses they reported, in either the government analysis or wider research.\n\nYou can read the full assessment we made back in 2018 here.", "lang": "en"}
