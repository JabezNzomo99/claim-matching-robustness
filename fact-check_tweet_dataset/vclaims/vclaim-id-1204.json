This primary claim is false. The original model of the statue was inspired by the figure of a female Arab peasant, enlarged to colossal proportions.\n\nThe full text of the post reads, \u201cThe original statue was a black woman given to us by France to pay homage to the slaves that were brought here by force. The original was refused by America so they made a new one with a white face on it! BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU WE ARE QUEENS!!!\u201d\n\nExamples of this claim are visible here and here .\n\nIn 1876, French craftsmen and artisans started construction of the statue in France, designed by sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi as a celebration of the centennial of the U.S. Declaration of Independence ( here ).\n\nBartholdi had proposed a monumental figure of a \u201crobe-clad woman representing Egypt\u201d during the construction of the Suez Canal in Egypt in the 1850s. While Egypt rejected the idea as too costly, Bartholdi\u2019s initial vision of an \u201cArab peasant\u201d evolved into one of a \u201ccolossal goddess\u201d that he\u2019d later apply to his Statue of Liberty design ( here ).\n\nThe early designs of this statue, per the work of scholars Barry Moreno and Edward Berenson, took the form of a veiled, peasant woman. The proposed work was entitled \u201cEgypt Carrying the Light to Asia.\u201d ( bit.ly/2Dv9Vet and bit.ly/2ZVYVOJ ).\n\nBerenson writes, \u201cBartholdi produced a series of drawings in which the proposed statue began as a gigantic female fellah, or Arab peasant and gradually evolved into a colossal goddess\u2026\u201d The final rendering for this monument, Berenson notes, was perched on a pedestal in loose-fitting robes holding a torch above its head ( bit.ly/30bGfuH ).\n\nBartholdi had also studied ancient classical figures of massive proportions. The statue of Helios, also known as the Colossus of Rhodes, influenced his plans for the eventual construction of Libertas, the subject of the Statue of Liberty ( bit.ly/3fheoj1 ).\n\nBartholdi was ultimately not commissioned for the work due to budgetary restraints, but he revisited these early models when designing what is now known as the Statue of Liberty, formally entitled \u201cLiberty Enlightening the World.\u201d ( www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm ).\n\nThe National Park Service confirms that the statue was modeled after the Roman Goddess Liberty, or Libertas, also stating that classical images of Liberty are often depicted in the female form ( here ).\n\nThe broken chains near the statue\u2019s feet, the NPS states, likely represent breaking free from \u201ctyranny and servitude.\u201d ( here )\n\nBy 1884, the entire statue was completed and put together in Paris, while construction workers, many of whom were recent immigrants, began building the statue\u2019s pedestal on Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor ( here and here ). The workers who reassembled the statue once it arrived in New York were also largely new immigrants.\n\nLess than a mile from Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty \u201cgrew as an inspiration to immigrants who sailed past her on their way to America,\u201d according to the Liberty Ellis Foundation ( here ), particularly with the inscription of Emma Lazarus\u2019s poem \u201cThe New Colossus\u201d ( here ) on the plaque of the pedestal in 1903.\n\nReuters recently debunked a claim alleging that Taylor Swift had called for the Statue of Liberty to be taken down ( here ).\n\nFalse. The Statue of Liberty was not modeled after an enslaved Black woman.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
