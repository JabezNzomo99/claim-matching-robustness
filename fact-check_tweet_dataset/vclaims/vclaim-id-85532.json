I mean, they will say anything to be able to win this. I mean, this is time and time again, lie after lie. You notice he won\u2019t say, well, I say this. We hear experts. You know, here\u2019s (INAUDIBLE) at home once said that this is what\u2019s happening with the Russians. It\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s so phony. I watched him bumble through the interview, I was able to hear it on audio a little bit. I mean, I can\u2019t think of bigger lies, but that exactly goes to show you what the DNC and what the Clinton camp will do. They will lie and do anything to win.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Donald Trump Jr. said: \u201cIt was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.\u201d He added: \u201cI was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter pleasantries were exchanged,\u201d he said, \u201cthe woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton. Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.\u201d He said she then turned the conversation to adoption of Russian children and the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. The 2012 law so enraged President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that he halted American adoptions of Russian children. \u201cIt became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting,\u201d Mr. Trump said.", "lang": "en"}
