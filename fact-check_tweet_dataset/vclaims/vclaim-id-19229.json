The note is being shared in two versions: the Facebook version and the Instagram version. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Posting the note on Facebook and Instagram profiles will prevent Facebook and Instagram from using one\u2019s data. Fact: The message (note) is a hoax which is being circulated on social media for the last 7 years. Both Facebook and Instagram have specified in their privacy/data policies that they use users\u2019 data for specific operations. So, when a user sign\u2019s up on these platforms, he/she gives permissions to these platforms to use his/her data. Instagram also mentions that a user \u2018can end this license anytime by deleting your (his) content or account. However, content will continue to appear if you (he) shared it with others and they have not deleted it\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen looked for the news on this change in Facebook/Instagram\u2019s privacy policy, it was found that the message/note is a hoax which is in circulation on social media from the last 7 years. The message again went viral this week. In an article by CBS News, it was found that a Facebook spokesperson (Facebook owns Instagram) has said to CBS News that there is no truth in this post.\n\nIn the \u2018Terms of Use\u2019 of Instagram, it can be seen that a user gives Instagram the license to use his content when he agrees to the permissions while signing up on the platform. Instagram also mentions: \u201cYou can end this license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it.\u201d So, just posting a notice on your wall/feed will not prevent Instagram from using your content. Similar provisions can be seen in the \u2018Data Policy\u2019 of Facebook, where it mentions that it uses user data to show relevant ads and for customized experience.\n\nA fact-check article by Snopes, when the same post went viral in 2012, can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, posting a note on Facebook/Instagram will not prevent Facebook/Instagram from using your data.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
