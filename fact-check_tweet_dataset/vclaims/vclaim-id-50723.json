The caption along with the video says, Please send this to all the people you know around the world to show them what the Indian ARMY is doing to the Kashmiri Muslims.\n\nTo verify the claim with the viral video, we broke down the clip into several keyframes and ran a reverse search on one of them. We found the viral video uploaded on a website named military.com with the caption: Warning Graphic: A former associate of Fazlullah (Mullah FM) in the Taliban who ran their criminal rule on Swat.\n\nThe video started with a warning, This is how Pakistan interrogates innocent Pashtuns without a court or a trial. It was uploaded on March 9, 2011, but the story behind the video was still not revealed.\n\nTaking a lead from this, we ran a search on Google with the keywords Pakistan army beating Pashtuns swat. We found a news report published on aljazeera.com explaining the incident with screen grabs from the viral video.\n\nAccording to the news article published on October 2, 2009, the video shows Pakistan army beating up men suspecting their links with the Taliban.\n\nThe news report also has a statement of then Pakistan Army spokesperson, Major Gen Athar Abbas, who said that the army was investigating the alleged abuse. However, the report also says that it was not clear where or when the video was shot and how authentic it was.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the viral video is around nine years old and from Pakistan. It has nothing to do with Kashmir.", "lang": "en"}
