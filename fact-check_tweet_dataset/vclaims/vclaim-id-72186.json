He said Clinton should be \"ashamed\" of herself for deleting 33,000 emails.\n\n\"There has never been anything like this,\" Trump said at the Oct. 9 event in St. Louis. \"You get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails.\"\n\nClinton and her campaign don\u2019t dispute that she deleted these 33,000 emails. They argue that these were personal in nature, rather than work-related, and therefore were not necessary to turn over.\n\nHowever, they have denied that they deleted the emails after receiving a congressional subpoena from the House Select Committee on Benghazi on March 4, 2015. But an August 2016 FBI report on its investigation shows that Trump\u2019s claim has some merit.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the timeline of relevant events, according to the FBI report. (The most pertinent information is on pages 15-19 of this document.)\n\nFeb. 1, 2013: Clinton serves her last day as secretary of state.\n\nJuly 23, 2014: The State Department reaches an agreement with the Benghazi committee about producing records for its investigation into the 2012 attack on a U.S. embassy in the Libyan city.\n\nOct. 28, 2014: The State Department sends an official letter to Clinton\u2019s staff requesting \"emails related to their government work.\" Clinton\u2019s lawyer, David Kendall, and aide Cheryl Mills oversaw the review of Clinton\u2019s email archives to produce work-related documents to the department.\n\nDec. 5, 2014: Clinton\u2019s team provides 55,000 pages of emails, or about 30,000 individual emails, to the State Department. Mills tells an employee at Platte River Networks, which managed the server, that Clinton does not need to retain any emails older than 60 days.\n\nMarch 2, 2015: The New York Times breaks the story that Clinton used a personal email account while secretary of state.\n\nMarch 4, 2015: The Benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring Clinton to turn over all emails from her private server related to the incident in Libya.\n\nBetween March 25-31, 2015: The Platte River Networks employee has what he calls an \"oh s---\" moment, realizing he did not delete Clinton\u2019s email archive, per Mills\u2019 December 2014 request. The employee deletes the email archive using a software called BleachBit.\n\nMarch 27, 2015: Clinton\u2019s lawyers send a letter to the Benghazi committee saying that the State Department already has the relevant emails, as they were included in the Dec. 5, 2014, turnover.\n\nTrump\u2019s timeline is correct. The congressional subpoena came on March 4, 2015, and an employee deleted the emails sometime after March 25, 2015, three weeks later.\n\nHowever, the implication \u2014 that Clinton deleted emails relevant to the subpoena in order to avoid scrutiny \u2014 is unprovable if not flat wrong.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s investigation did find several thousand emails among those deleted that were work-related and should have been turned over to the State Department. However, FBI Director James Comey said in a July 2016 statement that the FBI investigation \"found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\"\n\nComey added in a later congressional hearing that the FBI learned no one on Clinton\u2019s staff specifically asked the employee to delete the emails following the New York Times story and subpoena. Rather, the employee made that decision on his own.\n\nClinton told the FBI that she did was not involved in deciding whether individual emails should be sent to State Department, nor \"did she instruct anyone to delete her emails to avoid complying with FOIA, State or FBI requests for information.\"\n\nTrump said, \"You (Hillary Clinton) get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails.\"\n\nClinton\u2019s staff received a subpoena for Benghazi-related emails March 4. An employee managing her server deleted 33,000 of Clinton\u2019s emails three weeks later.\n\nThe FBI found no evidence that the emails were deleted deliberately to avoid the subpoena or other requests. Clinton\u2019s team requested for the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena came. They also argued that all the emails that would be relevant to the subpoena had already been turned over to the State Department.", "lang": "en"}
