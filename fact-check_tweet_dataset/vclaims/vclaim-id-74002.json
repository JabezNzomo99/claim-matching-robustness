This year, Janmashtami was celebrated on August 11. In the backdrop of this, a set of photographs showing injured peacocks are being circulated.\n\n\n\nThe text accompanying the post asks whether the peacock feathers are more important than their lives during Janmashtami. Further, the post asks why only the sacrifice of goats is hyped during Eid and not this.\n\nA simple google reverse search led to a report by The Quint which carried the viral photos.\n\nAccording to the report which was published on August 4, 2018, the residents of a neighbourhood in Marudhankulam, Madurai had found carcasses of peacocks strewn all over the ground.\n\nForest officials had suspected that rice grains mixed with poisonous substances led to the incident. However, residents had informed that there were no agricultural fields nearby.\n\nThe report added that rice grains were seen strewn all over the ground.\n\n\"Around 70 peacocks used to come every morning.
