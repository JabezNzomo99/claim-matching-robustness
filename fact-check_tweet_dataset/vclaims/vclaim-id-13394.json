Just this February, a number of UP students staged a mass walkout over the president\u2019s war on drugs, proposed shift to federalism, tax reform, and several other policies.\n\nQS ranks Asian universities based on 11 metrics: academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty-to-student ratio, international research network, citations per paper, papers per faculty, staff with a PhD, international faculty ratio and international student ratio, proportion of inbound exchange students and proportion of outbound exchange students.\n\nUP has also never placed in the top ten of the QS\u2019s annual review and ranking of universities, contrary to the impression trendingbalita.online gave in its story that it has done so in the past.\n\nThe misleading report was published four days after QS released on Oct. 24 the 2019 Asian University Rankings.\n\nIt could have reached almost 2.3 million people with social media traffic to the story largely coming from the pages PRESIDENT RODY DUTERTE -FEDERAL MOVEMENT INTERNATIONAL, Tulfo Brothers Worldwide, and Duterte Supporters.\n\nTrendingbalita.online has been publishing stories since July 6, 2017.", "lang": "en"}
