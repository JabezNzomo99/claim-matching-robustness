Republic did not provide a disclaimer stating that the image was for 'representational purpose' only.\n\nThe exact same photograph was used by international media in April 2017 to report about the hermit nation conducting a massive live fire drill to mark the anniversary of the foundation of its military on April 25, 1932.\n\nOn January 9th, the Supreme Court of India modified its November 2016 interim order that made it mandatory for the national anthem to be played in cinemas before movie screenings.\n\nThe decision was hotly discussed on most news channels during which the former major tweeted that as a soldier, one could not expect him to stand for those who couldn't stand for the national anthem.\n\nHis tweet drew mixed reactions on Twitter including a few responses from some veterans who berated his stance. At the time of writing this story, the tweet had attracted over 1200 comments, nearly 5,900 retweets and over 12,000 Likes.\n\n\"That man who guards the border believes in a cause.

The dubious comparison with North Korean state TV, a mouthpiece for the country's supreme leader Kim Jong Un, caught on after former BJP union minister Arun Shourie in an interview in 2017 drew parallels with Indian TV channels.\n\nRepublic ultimately relented and changed the image on the story but an archived version of the page can be viewed here.", "lang": "en"}
