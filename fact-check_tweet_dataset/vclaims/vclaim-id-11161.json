This is just one team within HMRC looking at both tax evasion and avoidance among wealthy individuals. Even then, there are another 400 staff in another team who focus on even wealthier people.\n\nHMRC employs over 26,000 staff working in enforcement and compliance.\n\nMr Robertson has a point if he means to compare staffing on benefit fraud and error with avoidance and evasion among just the very rich.\n\nThe two teams we\u2019ve mentioned add up to about 700 staff focused on these wealthy individuals. Meanwhile just under 3,800 staff work at the DWP\u2019s Fraud and Error Service.\n\nInvestigating fraud and error at the DWP\n\nThe DWP confirmed to us that currently 3,765 staff do work relating to benefit fraud and error at what\u2019s called the Fraud and Error Service. Mr Robertson\u2019s figure is an older version of this.\n\nBenefit fraud is illegal\u2014it happens when people knowingly claim too much. Error, on the other hand, involves accidents on the part of claimants or officials. Benefit fraud was estimated to cost \u00a31.3 billion in 2014/15. Adding in error there was a total of \u00a33 billion overpaid in benefits.\n\nWelcome to the Affluent Unit\n\nTax evasion is illegal activity where people conceal or misrepresent information in order to reduce the tax they pay. Avoidance is the exploitation of tax rules to gain an advantage which wasn\u2019t intended by Parliament, but which is legal.\n\nEvasion was estimated to cost \u00a34.4 billion in 2013/14, and adding in tax avoidance puts the total at just over \u00a37 billion. Other activities also add to the bill for lost tax.\n\nThe Affluent Unit works within HMRC, and is tasked with investigating where wealthy individuals are avoiding or evading taxes. It was set up in 2011, and covers people with incomes of over \u00a3150,000, or wealth of between \u00a31 million and \u00a320 million.\n\nThe unit has about 300 staff, although it\u2019s difficult to get a precise, up-to-date figure. It reportedly employed 327 to look at evasion and avoidance in 2014/15.\n\nThere\u2019s also another unit which covers people with wealth over \u00a320 million called the High Net Worth Unit. It has around 400 staff.\n\nSo the parts of HMRC covering these activities among the wealthiest individuals could be said to have around 700 staff.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t include everybody else\n\nHMRC told us it had over 26,000 people working across the range of its enforcement and compliance business, which is focused on stopping both tax evasion and avoidance. It said its dedicated units were important parts of that, but far from the sum total.\n\nThe SNP told us it acknowledged the HMRC figure was just for the very rich and not a like-for-like comparison with the DWP staff. It said it wanted to highlight the lack of transparency with the figures, given that it\u2019s not possible to get specific breakdowns of what HMRC staff are doing, beyond looking at individual teams like the Affluent Unit.\n\nThat may well be the case, but Mr Robertson\u2019s claim still wasn\u2019t justified by the available figures.\n\nAn earlier version of this factcheck appeared in our roundup from Prime Minister\u2019s Questions yesterday.", "lang": "en"}
