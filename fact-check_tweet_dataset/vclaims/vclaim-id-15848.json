(Hindi translation: \u092f\u0947 \u0924\u0940\u0938\u0930\u093e \u0939\u093e\u0925 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0915\u093e \u0939\u0948 ?)\n\nSeveral of the captions insinuate that the Congress party shared a photoshopped or fake image of Gandhi to boost his public image.\n\nThe same picture was tweeted by several verified Twitter handles including that of Smriti Irani and Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga.\n\nThe archived version of the viral posts can be accessed here, here, and here.\n\nWhen BOOM ran a reverse image search on the viral image, we found a similar image tweeted from the handle @i_theindian on January 8,2019 as a reply to a tweet by wire agency ANI.\n\nThis image makes it clear that there is another man standing beside the old woman, which explains the ghost hand.\n\nA further search shows the image is from December 2015, when Gandhi visited Puducherry to meet locals affected by devastating floods.
