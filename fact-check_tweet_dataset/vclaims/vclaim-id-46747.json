The claim is false; the video has circulated online since at least 2017 and shows police conducting a drill in Jharkhand, a state in eastern India; AFP previously debunked another misleading claim about the same video.\n\nThe 15-second clip was published here on Facebook on December 13, 2019. It has been viewed more than 11,000 times.\n\nThe video\u2019s Bengali caption translates to English as: \u201cIndiscriminate firing on agitators opposing the CAB. This is the BJP. Share it with all.\u201d\n\nCAB is an acronym for the Citizenship Amendment Bill, which became known as the Citizenship Amendment Act after the legislation was passed by the Indian Parliament on December 11, 2019. The law grants Indian citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, as reported by AFP here.\n\nBJP is an acronym for the Bharatiya Janata Party, India's ruling party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe video also includes a superimposed geotag that claims the location is in the northeastern state of Assam, which has experienced deadly unrest in recent weeks in response to the new law, AFP reported here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe claim is false; the video in fact shows police conducting a drill in Khunti, Jharkhand and has circulated online since at least 2017.\n\nEarlier this year, AFP debunked misleading posts which falsely claimed the video showed violence in Kashmir.\n\nA longer version of the video was published on YouTube here on November 1, 2017.\n\nThe video is titled: \u201cMoke Dreal [mock drill] of Khunti Police\u201d.\n\nAn announcement in Hindi by police at the end of the video translates to English as: \u201cThis was just a demo to show that the Khunti police is fully prepared to act against any untoward situation.\u201d\n\nA separate video of the same drill shot from a different angle was published here on November 3, 2017.\n\n\u201cIn Khunti rehearsal for police how we all police take charging and controlling on crowds at towns and other places. ( it's only and only rehearsal),\u201d the video\u2019s description reads.\n\nFreelance journalist Anand Dutta told AFP the video was recorded near Khunti\u2019s main square around the same time as celebrations for the Hindu festival of Diwali in 2017.\n\nDutta also sent photos taken on August 13, 2019, via WhatsApp of the street in Khunti where the drill was conducted.\n\nBelow is a comparison collage of the photos sent by Dutta (L) and screenshots taken from the video in the misleading Facebook post (R), with similar elements highlighted in green:", "lang": "en"}
