It was taken by Barry Z. Levine on Aug. 15, 1969.\n\nPictures of the recent Trump rally in Pennsylvania show a smaller crowd gathered at the airport where the rally was held.\n\nBoth Trump and Fred Keller, whom the president endorsed for a vacant seat in Congress during the rally, posted pictures of the spectators on Twitter. Trump posted four photos with this caption: \u201cMassive crowds in Pennsylvania tonight. Thank you for joining me!\u201d\n\nOne of those photos shows most of the crowd.\n\nKeller, who won the Pennsylvania special election the day after the rally, retweeted a photo of the crowd posted by Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, with this caption: \u201cGreat crowd building at the airport in Montoursville, PA for #MAGA rally.\u201d\n\nMost news coverage of the rally didn\u2019t report on the size of the crowd, but many outlets included pictures or video that show the crowd. One local Pennsylvania newspaper estimated that \u201cthousands\u201d were in the crowd.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
