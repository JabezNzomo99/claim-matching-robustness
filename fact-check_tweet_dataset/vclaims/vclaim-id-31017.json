Blu in the movie is the last known male of his species, and he must travel to Rio de Janeiro from his captivity in Minnesota to meet the last remaining female of his species to save their kind from extinction.\n\nBack in the real world, scientists in September 2018 recommended that the Spix\u2019s macaw, also known as the \u201clittle blue macaw,\u201d be reclassified from \u201ccritically endangered\u201d to \u201cextinct in the wild.\u201d\n\nThis recommendation has not yet been formalized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which maintains a \u201cred list\u201d of endangered species. The organization last assessed the Spix\u2019s macaw on Aug. 7, 2018, prior to the aforementioned study first published online on Sept. 1, 2018. In their paper, the scientists described the last known sightings of Spix\u2019s macaw in the wild:\n\nLast known from near the rio S\u00e3o Francisco in north Bahia, Brazil, where only three birds remained in 1985\u20131986, and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw (Propyrrhura maracana), was discovered at the site in July 1990, and survived until the end of 2000. There have been no subsequent records of wild birds, despite searches and fieldworker presence in the area. An observation in 2016 in the Curaca area is believed to relate to a release from captivity. Loss of gallery woodland and trapping for the cagebird trade likely drove declines.\n\nWhile wild individuals have likely not been seen since 2000, a captive population of about 60 or 70 species in the hands of both breeding programs and private owners still exists. In 2018, the Brazilian government announced that a population of around 50 Spix\u2019s macaws from Europe would be transferred to a reintroduction facility in Brazil:\n\nThe current batch of survivors being repatriated from Europe will initially stay in a special center due to open in Berlin next Thursday, where they will be prepared for the transition. They will then move to a 72-acre reintroduction center in a conservation area of Brazil\u2019s north-eastern state of Bahia, with the first being released into the wild in 2021. Brazil\u2019s environment ministry said that international breeding programs for the birds in captivity have seen the population grow from 79 in 2012 to 158 this year.\n\nThe number of blue-named and/or blue-colored macaws has created some internet confusion about what birds are \u2014 and are not \u2014endangered or extinct. A viral meme from the French Facebook page Jadore Les Animaux, for example, shared a picture of a blue-colored macaw with the text: \u201cThe world is in mourning. The blue macaw has been declared extinct.\u201d\n\nFirst, while there are multiple species of blue macaws, \u201cblue macaw\u201d is not the common or informal name for any of them. The closest match to that name would be the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna), whose population is not threatened.\n\nSecondly, as Agence France-Presse noted in a fact check of that viral post, the species shown in the photo was actually a different species of macaw known as the hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus). This species is classified as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the IUCN.\n\nBut because scientists have determined the wild population of Spix\u2019s macaw to be likely extinct in the wild, we rate the claim about the bird species fictionalized in the \u201cRio\u201d movies as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
