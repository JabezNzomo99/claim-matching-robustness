The claim is false, the video has circulated online since 2018.\n\nThe video has been posted repeatedly on Facebook, for example here where it has been viewed 2.2 million times since it was uploaded February 26, 2019.\n\nThe footage appears to show an Indian journalist reporting live near the India-Pakistan border as civilians evacuate the area amid heavy shelling from Pakistan.\n\nThe misleading posts, for example here and here, were all uploaded hours after India said its warplanes had launched airstrikes against militant camps in Kashmir on February 26, 2019.\n\nHere is an AFP story on the strikes.\n\nThe posts' caption says: \"Pakistan starts heavy shelling\". Below is a screenshot of one of the posts:\n\nIn the video, a journalist wearing a bulletproof vest and helmet is speaking to the camera in Hindi as local police help residents evacuate the area behind him.\n\nIn the audio, the journalist can be heard saying: \u201cIndian army is saving civilians and people are being taken to safer places. We are at Arnia sector where heavy firing from Pakistan rangers is going on.\n\n\"Police are clearing the area and taking the local population to safer places. I have been asked to board the armoured vehicle as it is unsafe to stay out. I will also ask my cameraperson to come inside the vehicle.\"\n\nA reverse image search using keyframes taken from the footage found that the original video has been posted here on News Tak's verified YouTube channel on May 23, 2018.\n\nThe video's caption says: \"Jammu & Kashmir: The tension at the international border in RS Pura and Arnia sectors escalated as Pakistani Rangers continued to fire on Indian posts and civilian areas.\"\n\nAaj Tak is an Indian Hindi language news channel and News Tak is the group's digital news channel.\n\nThe reporter and the original caption both say the incident on camera is happening in Arnia sector, which is located in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nA Google search with the keywords 'Arnia sector shelling' found news articles from May 23, 2018 which reported the incident on the border, for example here from India Today and here from the Times of India.", "lang": "en"}
