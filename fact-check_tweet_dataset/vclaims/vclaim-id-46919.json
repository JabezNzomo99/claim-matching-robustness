The post says that one of the people photographed with then-President Barack Obama and then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is the same person. \"Also guy who led the storming of the U.S. embassy,\" the wording over the Facebook image reads.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe looked into it. And while it we can\u2019t verify what role this man played in the Dec. 31 U.S. Embassy raid (we find nothing indicating he \"led\" it as the post suggests), it does appear he was in attendance there as well as being a White House visitor years earlier during the Obama administration.\n\nNews outlets like the Associated Press are reporting that a man named Hadi al-Amiri was among commanders of militia factions loyal to Iran who joined protesters outside the embassy on Dec. 31. In 2011, Amiri, then Iraq\u2019s transportation minister, did indeed visit the White House. (You can read more on the criticism his appearance drew here.)\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted the first photo that appears in the Facebook post alongside two others on Dec. 31.\n\n\"The attack today was orchestrated by terrorists \u2014 Abu Mahdi al Muhandis and Qays al-Khazali \u2014 and abetted by Iranian proxies \u2014 Hadi al Amari and Faleh al-Fayyad,\" he wrote. \"All are pictured below outside our embassy.\"\n\nThis photo of that 2011 White House meeting is similar to the one that appears in the Facebook post, though Obama is obscured by a lamp. If you zoom in on the man in the blue tie, it appears to be Hadi al-Amiri, though the photo caption doesn\u2019t identify him.\n\nWe don\u2019t know Amiri\u2019s role in the December attack. Fox News reported \"it is unclear what Amiri\u2019s level of involvement was in the siege.\" The Associated Press said he \"joined the protesters outside the embassy in a strikingly bold move.\" In a story headlined, \"These 3 pro-Iran militia leaders are provoking protesters at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad,\" the Washington Post said he was \"also in attendance.\"\n\nBut he is the same person who visited the White House in 2011.\n\nA viral Facebook post displays two pictures \u2014 one taken at the White House in 2011 and one taken at a protest outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in December 2019 \u2014 and says they show the same man was at both.
