This is not the case.\n\nThe lengthy post is visible here . It claims: \u201cAsk any biostatistician what it means when you test hundreds of thousands of people a day for an infectious disease and return a consistently lowering positivity rate. I\u2019ll give you a clue: it means heard (sic) immunity has been reached and the virus is dying out.\u201d\n\nThis fact check will focus on that primary claim, not on the remaining content of the post.\n\nHerd immunity, also referred to as herd protection, describes a scenario where enough people in a population have immunity to an infection to be able to effectively stop that disease from spreading. This can be achieved either through vaccination, which is still not available for COVID-19, or from people having had the disease. (See a Reuters explainer here ).\n\nExperts estimate that to achieve herd protection from the new coronavirus through infection, at least 70% of the population in the U.S. would need to have recovered from the disease and developed antibodies against future infection ( here , here ). Recent projections range between 43 and 66% ( bit.ly/3koj8WY , bit.ly/2Do75Z8 )\n\nBut there are still questions about whether the antibody response to the virus is robust and how long it lasts ( here ). Emerging evidence suggests that the body\u2019s antibody response against COVID-19 may only last months after infection ( here ).\n\nWHAT DOES THE RATE OF POSITIVE TESTS MEAN?\n\nThe claim features a graph by John Hopkins University ( archive.vn/xZMuz ) that shows the total daily number of virus tests conducted in the U.S. and how many of these tests were positive.\n\nThe rate of positive tests actually provides an insight into how much testing is being conducted and what kind of patients are being included in the testing. John Hopkins University explains that a high positivity rate suggests that tests are largely being conducted to the \u201csickest patients\u201d, possibly meaning that milder or asymptomatic cases are not being tested. A lower rate, on the contrary, may indicate that testing is also including these \u201cmilder\u201d patients. ( here )\n\nThis question of whether positivity rates are an indication of herd immunity was addressed by a team of global health scientists and infection preventionists at the Meedan Digital Health Lab, a public health information hub here .\n\nThe experts note two elements to disprove this claim: first, evidence to support COVID-19 long-term immunity is lacking. \u201cHerd immunity would require a large majority of the population to become infected with the virus and obtain long-term immunity to COVID-19 \u2014 but since we know so little about long-term immunity right now, we can\u2019t say anything about herd immunity in relation to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThey also mention that positivity rates can mean \u201ca wide variety of things\u201d. It could mean an increasing spread of the disease if \u201cthe rate of positive tests increases while the amount of testing stays the same\u201d. It could also indicate that not enough tests are being conducted, if \u201cmore tests come back with positive results but tests were conducted on a smaller percentage of the population than the week before,\u201d for example.\n\nIn an op-ed for the New York Times here , Yale immunobiology professors Akiko Iwasaki and Ruslan Medzhitov wrote: \u201cGiven the severe consequences of COVID-19 for many older patients, as well as the disease\u2019s unpredictable course and consequences for the young, the only safe way to achieve herd immunity is through vaccination.\u201d\n\nOn June 29, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that even with a vaccine that was 70-75% effective, the U.S. would \u201cunlikely\u201d achieve herd immunity if, as one opinion poll suggested, up to a third of Americans are not willing to get vaccinated ( here ) .\n\nFalse. The rate of positive COVID-19 tests in the United States does not indicate that herd immunity has been reached.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
