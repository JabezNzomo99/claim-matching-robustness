One bogus story, however, claimed that the outcome was due to voter fraud, and it has been shared on social media with a combined 3.8 million followers.\n\nThat story, posted on the conservative site Gateway Pundit, proclaimed in its headline: \u201cVOTER FRAUD: Orange County Numbers DON\u2019T ADD UP \u2013 Democrats Had 300,000 More Votes for Congressional Seats than for Governor.\u201d\n\nBut it offered no evidence to support the claim of voter fraud and incorrectly calculated the vote totals.\n\nGateway Pundit, Nov. 19: 300,000 (299,931) more Democrats voted for the Democrats in the Orange County Congressional races than voted for Democrat Gavin Newsom for governor. And Republican John Cox beat Newsome [sic] by 12,000 votes in Orange County. This makes no sense and points to fraud.\n\nThe story reaches that conclusion by adding up the number of votes cast for the Democratic congressional candidates in six districts within Orange County and subtracting the number of votes cast in the county for Newsom, the Democratic candidate for governor.\n\nBut there are a few things wrong there:\n\u2022 The story gets the numbers wrong. Cox beat Newsom in Orange County by 2,934 votes, not 12,000, according to the unofficial results from the county as of Nov. 21.\n\u2022 There are actually seven congressional districts in Orange County, but the story doesn\u2019t account for the 38th Congressional District.\n\u2022 Most importantly, the story uses vote tallies for six entire congressional districts when some of those districts include voting precincts in neighboring counties. Only three of the districts are wholly within Orange County, so the total number of votes cited in the story is inflated.\n\nFor example, the 49th Congressional District lies mostly in San Diego County with only part of the district in Orange County. In that district, Orange County voters cast 31,958 ballots for Democrat Mike Levin out of a districtwide total of 150,536 ballots for Levin. Although Levin won the district, his Republican opponent, Diane Harkey, got more votes in Orange County. Harkey received 36,978 votes in the county.\n\nCounting only the votes cast by Orange County voters for Democratic congressional candidates (including the 38th District), the difference between that total and the number of votes cast for Newsom is 37,027, not 300,000, as of Nov. 21.\n\nThat means that 37,027 people may have split their votes between parties, if they voted in both the congressional and gubernatorial races.\n\nGateway Pundit later updated its story, changing the headline and adding county vote tallies, too. But, the story says, \u201cThis (still) screams of voter fraud,\u201d without offering any evidence to support the fraud claim.\n\nNeal Kelley, the registrar of voters for Orange County, didn\u2019t see anything suspect in the numbers. About a third of the county\u2019s voters aren\u2019t registered with a party, he said in an interview with FactCheck.org, and those voters frequently split their votes between parties. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing doesn\u2019t surprise me at all,\u201d he said.\n\nKelley also said that none of the complaints of potential voter fraud that his office has investigated have resulted in a legitimate case.\n\nStuart Rothenberg, a senior editor at Inside Elections and a nonpartisan political observer, offered another explanation for the split ballots in an interview with FactCheck.org. Voters see congressional midterm elections as a referendum on the sitting president, he said, and \u201celecting a governor is a completely different matter.\u201d\n\nAlso, Rothenberg said, college-educated white suburban women moved substantially away from supporting Republican candidates for federal office in the midterms. \u201cThose are the demographics in Orange County,\u201d he said, adding that those voters might well maintain support for Republican candidates in state or local elections.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nHoft, Jim. \u201cVOTER FRAUD: Orange County Numbers DON\u2019T ADD UP \u2013 Democrats Had 300,000 More Votes for Congressional Seats than for Governor.\u201d TheGatewayPundit.com. 19 Nov 2018.\n\nKelley, Neal.
