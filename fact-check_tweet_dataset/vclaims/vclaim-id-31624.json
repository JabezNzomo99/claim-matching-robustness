No, that's not true: The video does not appear to show Chinese people but rather Filipino men. They are heard speaking a mixture of Arabic and Tagalog, the latter of which is widely spoken in the Philippines. The original video was shared before the novel coronavirus was first widely reported.\n\nThe claim originated from a video post (archived here) published by Maamud Kamara on February 16, 2020, under the title \"20m Chinese converted to Islam after it was proven that the corona epidemic did not afflict muslims.\"\n\nThe video claimed that 20 million Chinese people converted to Islam because the novel coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, would not affect Muslims. The video does not support these claims.\n\nWe spoke to a media executive based in Manila (who preferred that we not publish her name). She and a colleague from Indonesia analyzed the video for Lead Stories. On the clip, they said, the men are heard reciting the Shahada, a Muslim declaration of faith, first in Arabic and then again in Tagalog. Here is their translation:\n\nI bear witness \n\nthat there's no one \n\nmore rightful \n\nand exceptional \n\nthat should be praised \n\naside from the true God, \n\nAllah. \n\nI also bear witness \n\nthat Muhammad \n\nis a servant, \n\nsubservient, \n\na messenger of Allah. \n\nAnd I also bear witness \n\nthat Jesus, \n\nson of Mary, \n\nsubservient, \n\na servant, \n\nand messenger of Allah. \n\nThank you very much, \n\nyou may now take your seats.\n\nOur sources said the men appear to be Filipino, not Chinese.\n\nAlso, it is implausible to suggest that Muslims would become immune to the coronavirus. Vox reported that there are concerns about the virus affecting China's Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority, who are being held in internment camps.\n\nTurnBackHoax.ID, an Indonesian fact-checker, has already rated the video as false. It concluded that the video had been shared before the outbreak was first reported. Here is a Google translation of its reporting:\n\nAs of February 20, 2020, at least 2,118 deaths are blamed on the coronavirus, according to The New York Times.\n\nWe wrote about fake news on YouTube before.
