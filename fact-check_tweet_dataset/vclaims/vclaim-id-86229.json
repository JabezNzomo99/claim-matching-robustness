Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who started this line of attack last summer. Ocasio-Cortez, at the time a novice politician who had just won her primary, went way too far and earned Four Pinocchios.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the percentage of people working two jobs has actually declined since the Great Recession \u2014 and been relatively steady at around 5 percent since 2010. The percentage bounced around a bit but it was as low as 4.5 percent in August 2017 and was 5.0 percent in the February jobs report, the most recent available.\n\n\u201cAfter reaching a peak of 6.2 percent during 1995-96, the multiple job-holding rate began to recede,\u201d the BLS noted in a report. \u201cBy the mid-2000s, the rate had declined to 5.2 percent and remained close to that level from 2006 to 2009. In 2010, the multiple job-holding rate decreased to 4.9 percent and has remained at 4.9 percent or 5.0 percent from 2010 to 2017.\u201d\n\n\u201c[They say] \u2018the economy is great, it is doing great for everybody.\u2019 And then you ask them, well, how is that? Well, they\u2019ll point to the stock market. Well, that\u2019s fine if you own stocks. Then you\u2019ll ask them, what\u2019s your other measure? And they\u2019ll talk about well, the unemployment rate is down. That\u2019s fine. Yeah, well, I\u2019ve been traveling our country. People are working. They\u2019re working two and three jobs to pay the bills. It\u2019s not working for working people.\"\n\nBut Harris is much more careful than Ocasio-Cortez. She does not link it directly to the unemployment rate. She appears to suggest this is an anecdote. We had earlier faulted her for not stating that directly, and now she\u2019s added a sentence to make that clearer: \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019ve been traveling our country.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke was apparently speaking to a teacher when he made this aside. His spokesman says that O\u2019Rourke was referring to a study released by the Texas State Teachers Association (TSTA). In August, the union said that a survey of its members found that 39 percent of teachers expect to take extra jobs outside the classroom to meet family expenses.\n\nBut most of those extra jobs are part time, not full time. And as we noted, the \u201cmillions\u201d of people amount to just 5 percent of Americans with jobs. So that means 95 percent are not working two or three jobs \u201cjust to survive.\u201d The percentage has been roughly steady since the Great Recession, and in fact is lower than in the mid-1990s, when it hovered around 6 percent.\n\nEach of these 2020 candidates are straining to make the economy appear worse. In doing so, they are following the example of President Trump, who in his campaign for the presidency repeatedly used to make a similar claim about people having to hold more than one job, such as saying in September 2016: \u201cMany people, because of Obamacare and for other reasons, are holding two jobs.\u201d\n\nActually, no matter how hard politicians try to spin it, the percentage of people with two or more jobs has been around 5 percent for almost a decade. Democrats suggesting this is something new \u2014 in an era of unusually low unemployment \u2014 are misleading their supporters.", "lang": "en"}
