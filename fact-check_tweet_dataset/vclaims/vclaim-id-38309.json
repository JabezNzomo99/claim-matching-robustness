February 22, 2020 \u2014 they\u2019re getting closer!\u201d\n\nClaiborne pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. in April 2019, after sharing information with Chinese agents in exchange for money and gifts. There is no evidence she worked directly with Hillary Clinton or as her \u201cspokesman\u201d while Clinton was secretary of state.\n\nClaiborne began working at the State Department in 1999 as an office management specialist and had overseas postings in Beijing and Shanghai, among other places, according to Fox News.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2016, she passed Chinese intelligence agents non-classified documents in exchange for money and gifts, according to a Justice Department press release. The FBI arrested Claiborne in March 2017.\n\nThe viral post, however, gets key facts about Claiborne\u2019s case wrong. (RELATED: Did Hillary Clinton Lie To The FBI?)\n\nClaiborne pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. \u2014 not treason, as the post incorrectly suggests \u2014 and was sentenced to 40 months in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000, per the Justice Department press release. Prosecutors dropped other counts of felony obstruction, lying to the FBI and wire fraud after she accepted that plea deal, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe date of her guilty plea is also wrong. Claiborne accepted the plea deal in April 2019 and got sentenced three months later in July.\n\nWhile Claiborne was employed at the State Department during Clinton\u2019s tenure, there is no evidence she worked as Clinton\u2019s \u201cspokesperson\u201d or worked directly with her in any capacity.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
