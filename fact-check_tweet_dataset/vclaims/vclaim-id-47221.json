Three of the claims are true, while claims about vaccination, a bill proposing funding for contact tracing, defunding the World Health Organization and the president's executive orders are false or misleading.\n\nThe post, shared since May 2020 in the United States and in Canada, begins, \u201cWhile the msm [mainstream media] works tirelessly to make Donald Trump out to be a buffoon, over the last week he did the following, but you probably won't hear about it:\u201d before listing nine achievements credited to the US president.\n\nThe post was also shared in South Africa while a similar list was shared in French.\n\nClaim 1: \u201cMade vaccines voluntary not mandatory. Military will check purity and distribute vaccines\u201d\n\nTrump has weighed-in regarding vaccines while president, including telling Americans that the measles vaccine is \u201cso important\u201d during a 2019 outbreak and recently expressing hope for a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nHowever, vaccination regulations are set by states and not at the federal level, meaning Trump does not have the power to make vaccines voluntary.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cAll states require children to be vaccinated against certain communicable diseases as a condition for school attendance. In most instances, state school vaccination laws expressly apply to both public school as well as private schools.\u201d This also applies to daycare attendance.\n\nAll states offer medical exemptions and some offer religious and philosophical exemptions as outlined in this AFP fact check and here by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThere is no evidence that the US military will \u201ccheck the purity\u201d of vaccines. However, Trump said in this May, 2020 press conference that they would be involved in the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nClaim 2: \u201cDefunded WHO forever and wants an investigation into its operations\u201d\n\nTrump did halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) pending a review into WHO\u2019s role in what he said, in an April 2020 press conference, was \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThis does not mean that the funding will be permanently withdrawn as suggested in the post.\n\nAs of May 31, the United States owed the WHO more than $203 million in outstanding assessed contribution fees according to the WHO\u2019s contributions overview.\n\nA legal analysis by Zachary Price, professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law, explained that the US Congress has the power to mandate funding of the WHO in future appropriations, and could still do so.\n\nClaim 3: Cancelled the Democrats HR6666 bill, known as the Covid19TRACE Act\n\nH.R.6666, the \u201cCOVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act\u201d was introduced to congress by Democratic Congressman Bobby Rush on May 1, 2020.\n\n\n\n The bill proposes a $100 billion fund to be managed by the CDC, \u201cfor testing, contact tracing, monitoring, and other activities to address COVID-19\u201d.\n\nThe bill remains in the committee stage of the legislative process. It would still need to go through a vote in the House of Representatives, another in the Senate and a mediation between the two, before arriving on the president\u2019s desk for signature or veto.\n\nAt this stage, Trump has not \u201ccancelled\u201d HR6666 and has not publicly commented or expressed a desire to veto the bill.\n\nThere is no evidence to support the claim that ID2020 has been \u201ccancelled.\u201d As of June 16, 2020, the organization remained active and the claim the ID2020 is a \u201cBill Gates project\u201d is misleading.\n\nAs explained in this AFP fact check, the ID2020 is an alliance coordinating governments, NGOs and private businesses, including Microsoft, but is not led or exclusively run by Microsoft. The project\u2019s board of directors has representatives from a variety of global companies and organizations.\n\nThe alliance states its goal is to provide verified digital identity to \u201cover 1 billion people worldwide (who) are unable to prove their identity through any recognized means.\u201d\n\nBill Gates has been at the center of many conspiracy theories since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which were debunked in this AFP fact check.\n\nAdditional claims that the Gates Foundation is implanting microchips during coronavirus testing have also been debunked by AFP.\n\nClaim 5: \u201cOpened a complaint platform to report censorship on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It was overrun with complaints. They got the evidence\u201d\n\nIn May 2019, the White House launched this platform for \u201cAmericans to share their stories of suspected political bias\u201d on social media platforms.\n\nAs of June 16, 2020, the platform was no longer open to submissions, stating that the \u201cWhite House received thousands of responses\u201d.\n\nClaim 6: \u201cExecutive Order to reopen states: Governors who refuse to reopen will be sued\u201d\n\nAccording to the official Federal Register of Executive Orders Trump has not issued an Executive Order to reopen states, and a legal expert said if he attempted to sue governors over their individual public health orders, he would likely be unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cTrump has not issued such an executive order lifting state pandemic restrictions. His power to affect state restrictions on activities during a public health emergency are quite limited,\u201d Keith Whittington, Professor of Politics at Princeton University, told AFP by email.\n\nWhittington added that the \u201cconstitutional authority of the states is pretty expansive when it comes to responding to a public health emergency, and the states are fairly well positioned to win most such legal challenges. The president does not have any independent constitutional or statutory authority to simply lift the public health orders issued by state officials.\u201d\n\nClaim 7: \u201cExecutveOrder (sic) for W.H. to take over all Electrical Grids: Which will include Internet servers, Broadcasting systems, Electronic systems\u201d\n\nThe Federal Register of Executive Orders shows that Trump issued this order which aims to limit the involvement of foreign \u201cadversaries\u201d from \u201ccreating and exploiting vulnerabilities in the United States bulk-power system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a \u2018takeover\u2019 of \u2018all electrical grids,\u2019 and the president does not have the statutory or constitutional authority to engage in such a \u2018takeover,\u2019\u201d according to Whittington.\n\nFurthermore, the order makes no mention of \u201cinternet servers\u201d, \u201cbroadcasting systems\u201d or \u201celectronic systems\u201d as stated in the post.\n\nClaim 8: \u201cDeclares places of worship 'EssentialSevices.' (sic) Some mayors are fining people for going to church\u201d\n\nTrump announced in this May 22, 2020 press conference that he was calling on all governors to reopen places of worship, declaring them as \u201cessential places that provide essential services.\u201d He added: \u201cif they don\u2019t do it, I will override the governors.\u201d\n\nTrump does not have the direct ability to reopen churches. \u201cHe could direct the Justice Department to investigate potential state violations of religious liberty, which in practice would mean the government filing supporting briefs in existing lawsuits by churches objecting to restrictions on church services,\u201d said Whittington.\n\nThe City of Greenville, Mississippi fined a pastor and churchgoers $500 for attending a drive-in service, although the fines have since been cancelled.\n\nSimilar fines were ordered in Chicago and Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nClaim 9: \u201cApplauded Australia and 116 countries for insisting on a China Probe into the spread of Covid19 despite several threats from China about refusing critical exports.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted his support on May 18, 2020 after Australia and others called for an independent probe into the spread of COVID-19. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo echoed this support of the \u201cmore than 120 nations\u201d who \u201chave taken up the American call for an inquiry into the origins of the virus.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cthreats\u201d referred to in this claim are illustrated in this interview with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, saying his country would \u201cnever be intimidated by threats.\u201d\n\nBoth China and the World Health Organization have since agreed to an independent review \u201cat the earliest appropriate moment\u201d as reported by AFP here and here.", "lang": "en"}
