For-profit institutions tend to have higher tuition, and a vast majority of their students take out federal loans to pay for that tuition. One study found that tuition and fees in 2009-2010 for public community colleges averaged just $2,300 for in-state students, while for-profit two-year colleges charged more than six times as much, averaging $15,000.\n\nAs the department put it in a statement to The Fact Checker: \u201cA good program, or one that prepares students for gainful employment, results in students who have jobs and have earnings that allow them to pay their educational debt. Conversely, a poor-performing program is one where students are not able to find jobs, or who find jobs with earnings so low that they are unable to manage their debt.\u201d\n\nFirst, note that the statistic concerns a percentage of \u201cprograms,\u201d not overall graduates. The Education Department does not have individual student data, so it could well be that most graduates do fine, especially from the larger programs. The list of 8,000 programs that were measured includes everything from massage therapy to nursing or becoming a legal assistant. The programs could be very big \u2014 or relatively small. But each is counted as one program.\n\nAs an example of how this might work, imagine taking the same approach to evaluate different departments at an elite college. Three years after graduation, how would the philosophy department fare, on average? Suppose you had five philosophy majors, and one was unemployed, one made $20,000 a year, one made $24,000, one made $30,000 a year and one made $45,000. \u201cOn average,\u201d the wage is in the program is $23,800 \u2014 just enough for the philosophy department at Ivy League U to be labeled as producing graduates earning less than high school dropouts under the department\u2019s metric. The median figure would be $24,000, also below the cut-off point.\n\nThe research on the earnings potential from for-profit colleges is mixed. Part of the issue is that people entering such programs often don\u2019t make a lot of money to begin with, and so they start at a low base \u2014 and have high borrowing costs. But a review of the academic research shows that there is some sort of earnings gain. \u201cWe find lower earnings for for-profits than other college students but not so low that they would imply no earnings gain at all,\u201d said Lawrence Katz of Harvard University, who recently co-authored a lengthy examination of for-profit programs.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that there will not be earnings gains,\u201d Ritsch said. \u201cThere may very well be earnings gains in the vast majority of these programs. A student may be making much less than a high school dropout before they enroll in a program, and three years after they graduated they are still making slightly less than a high school dropout. That\u2019s a problem if you have accumulated debt that requires a couple of thousand dollars a year in loan payments.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
