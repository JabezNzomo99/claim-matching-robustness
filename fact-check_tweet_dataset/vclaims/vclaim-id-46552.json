Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The granddaughter of Elvis Presley singing \u2018It\u2019s Now or Never\u2019. Fact: The name of the girl singing in the video is Angelina Jordan and she is not the grand-daughter of legendary singer Elvis Presley. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshot of the girl from the video was run through the Google Reverse Image Search, a link to a website with a similar image of the girl can be found in the search results. According to the \u2018See it Live\u2019 website, the girl in the video is Angelina Jordan, a 13-year-old singer from Norway. In the video, she was singing \u201cIt\u2019s Now or Never\u201d for a show at Fredricksten Castle in Halden, Norway. She was the winner of \u201cNorway\u2019s Got Talent\u201d (Norske Talenter) in 2014. More information about her can be found on her website.\n\nWhen checked for the names of grand-daughters of Elvis Presley, it was found that he did not have any grand-daughter with the name Angelina Jordan. He has three grand-daughters (Riley Keough, Harper Vivienne Ann Lockwood, and Finley Aaron Love Lockwood).\n\nTo sum it up, the girl singing in the video is not Elvis Presley\u2019s grand-daughter. She is Angelina Jordan, a Norwegian singer.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
