In May, a number of Facebook posts and news articles asserted that police had warned users to avoid the feature because it was supposedly \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nAccording to TIME magazine\u2019s coverage, which was a bit less bombastic than the warnings, the \u201cFacebook Reactions\u201d feature eroded user privacy:\n\nFacebook has already had difficulties in Belgium, with privacy authorities there having forced it to stop tracking non-users with its browser cookies. But this is a new one. Explaining that Facebook\u2019s users are the product, the Belgian police wrote that the new reaction symbols help the social network to evaluate the effectiveness of its advertising.\n\nThe claim indeed originated from an advisory published by police in Belgium, in which they said that using the function affected Facebook\u2019s algorithmic arrangement of content and ads by assessing a user\u2019s mood:\n\nLimiting them to six, Facebook account the fact that you express your thoughts more easily allowing the algorithms running in the background to target you. With your clicks, it will be possible to determine those contents that put you in a good mood. So that will help Facebook find the perfect location, on your profile, allowing it to display content that will arouse your curiosity but also to choose the time you present it. If it appears that you are in a good mood phase, so it can deduce that you are more receptive and able to sell spaces explaining advertisers that they will have more chance to see you react.\n\nA number of posts and articles reported that police in general warned that the function was \u201cdangerous,\u201d but the original comment from Belgian police simply said said that the function could position Facebook better to \u201carouse your curiosity.\u201d No information was included to substantiate the claim that Facebook Reactions constituted a meaningful threat to privacy.", "lang": "en"}
