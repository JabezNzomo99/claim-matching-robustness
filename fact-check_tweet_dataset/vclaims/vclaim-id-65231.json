No, that's not true: Granato woke up on April 25, read a fake news story about her own demise, and responded that she was alive and well.\n\nThe claim originated in an article (archived here) published by n5ti.com on April 25, 2020, titled \"First volunteer in UK coronavirus vaccine trial has died - News Oxford,\" which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nGranato made a tweet (archived here) to confirm that she was alive, and asked people to not give this fake news any attention. For an alternative to reading fake news, she offered a video of a kitten. Before changing her Twitter account privacy settings to \"protected,\" she had publicly written:\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care also made a tweet:\n\n\n\nThese reassurances did not prevent some people from wondering if there wasn't a cover-up. Why would Granato hide her Twitter account? Why did she post a video of a kitten instead of a more satisfying proof of life, like a video holding a newspaper? While many commenters focused on the human target blindsided by this fake news story, few turned around to question the publisher making this claim.\n\n\n\nAlmost two weeks earlier, on April 14, 2020, a spammer, Vida Werenkye, posted a link to a N5ti.com story into a New York Buy/Sell/Trade group. The story was titled, \"First person who received Covid-19 vaccine has died; two others in critical condition\".\n\nThis article was written by James Alami, the same author who wrote the false story about Granato. The earlier story, now removed from the n5ti website, was nearly identical to the other, only it was based in Seattle and was about a woman named Jennifer Haller. \n\n\n\nThe spammer employed a trick that Lead Stories has seen many times before from this network, which also includes the websites AB-TC.COM, CBTVN.COM, and MCMNT.COM. They turn the commenting off on the post so the people exposed to the fake news in Facebook groups do not have the opportunity to discuss the story amongst themselves -- or to warn others before they are tricked into clicking on the link.\n\n\n\n This is how the now-deleted April 14 article (cached here) began:\n\nThe first person to get the Covid-19 vaccine has died, officials have said.\n\nThe 43-year-old mother-of-two from Seattle after almost a month after availing herself for a jab in the first human trial of a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus pandemic. After taking the vaccine, Jennifer Haller said it was an amazing opportunity for her \"to do something.\" Two other patients who received the vaccine are in critical condition.\n\nFour patients received the jab at the Kaiser Permanente research facility in Seattle, Washington, reports the Associated Press news agency. Officials say the fourth person is being monitored against any adverse effects of the vaccine.\n\nCompare the sentence in each of the stories as the \"underlying health condition\" is introduced. When Granato's name was substituted for \"the Seattle woman,\" the word \"the\" was left in.", "lang": "en"}
