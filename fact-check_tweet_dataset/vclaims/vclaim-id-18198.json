But that campaign website acknowledges that Clinton does, indeed, have a plan. It says: \u201cDonald J. Trump\u2019s Plan Is More Complete Than Hillary Clinton\u2019s Plan.\u201d\n\nAs fact-checkers, we pay close attention to the words that politicians use. Words matter. And voters watching Trump\u2019s speech or Ivanka Trump\u2019s interview would have been falsely led to believe, as they both said, that Clinton had no plan that pertained to these issues.\n\nIvanka Trump also incorrectly said in an interview with ABC News that all of the employees of her father had a paid parental leave benefit. The Trump Organization later said in a statement that the policy varied \u201cfrom property to property.\u201d\n\nIn his Sept. 13 speech on child care in Aston, Pennsylvania, Trump talked about his proposal for tax deductions for child care expenses, which he first announced Aug. 8, and a new plan he was announcing to provide paid maternity leave to working mothers. He claimed Clinton didn\u2019t have any such plan:\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign website contains a child care and early childhood education plan \u2014 calling for universal access to preschool for 4-year-olds within 10 years and a doubling of the federal investment in Early Head Start and the Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership program, child development and support programs for children under age 3 and pregnant women. It also has a separate plan for 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.\n\nBoth plans have been posted on the site since at least early February, according to the cached images available through the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.\n\nIn a June 15, 2015, speech at a YMCA in Rochester, New Hampshire, two months after she had declared her candidacy, Clinton began talking about her policy ideas on child care.\n\n\u201cI will be rolling out specific policies over the weeks to come, but I do believe with all my heart that everything we need to do in our country really starts with how we treat our children and how we try to raise them, taking care of their needs, being able to stimulate them, to give them a better chance in life, helping them become successful and good citizens,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong her proposals in that speech: universal access to preschool, a \u201cmiddle-class tax cut\u201d aimed at reducing child care costs, and a doubling of the funding in the Early Head Start programs.\n\nSince then, Clinton has announced more details and how she would pay for her proposals \u2014 by increasing taxes on the wealthy.\n\nIn late November 2015, Clinton proposed a tax credit of up to $1,200 for those caring for an elderly family member. In a speech in May in Kentucky, she proposed capping the amount a family spends on child care at 10 percent of income, a goal her website says she would achieve \u201cby significantly increasing the federal government\u2019s investment in child care subsidies and providing tax relief for the cost of child care to working families.\u201d On her website, she also calls for a program to give scholarships of up to $1,500 per year to students who are parents to help pay for child care.\n\nAs for family leave, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, signed by President Bill Clinton, requires certain employers to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave with existing medical benefits and job protection for workers to care for a newborn or adopted child, an ill family member or because of a personal illness. The federal requirement pertains to workplaces with 50 or more employees within 75 miles, and workers who have been on the job at least 12 months.\n\nIn January, Clinton proposed guaranteeing up to 12 weeks of paid leave covering at least two-thirds of a worker\u2019s salary (with a ceiling) \u201cto care for a new child or a seriously ill family member, and up to 12 weeks of medical leave to recover from a serious illness or injury of their own.\u201d That mirrors congressional legislation introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, though Clinton proposes paying for it by \u201cmaking the wealthy pay their fair share,\u201d rather than the 0.2 percent increase in the payroll tax on employees and employers under the bill. Gillibrand and DeLauro\u2019s legislation would set up a new trust fund under the Social Security Administration to operate the program.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, proposed on Aug. 8 to allow parents to deduct the average cost of child care in their state from their income taxes. His website says the deduction is limited to those earning under $250,000 a year or $500,000 for couples. And for low-income workers, his website says, he proposes increasing the earned income tax credit by an amount equal to up to half of payroll taxes. He also proposed on Sept. 13 allowing tax-free contributions, up to $2,000 per year, to dependent care savings accounts, with a 50 percent federal government match for low-income parents who contribute up to $1,000. Both programs are available for eldercare as well.\n\nFor maternity leave, Trump proposes six weeks of paid leave through the unemployment insurance program for \u201cany mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit.\u201d Mothers would get partial pay, equal to \u201cwhat would be paid to a laid-off employee,\u201d his website says. That was 46 percent of a worker\u2019s normal wages on average for the United States in 2014 and 2015, though the percentage varies by state. States also have a cap on unemployment compensation.\n\nTrump said in his Sept. 13 speech that the maternity leave program would be \u201ccompletely self-financing\u201d by ending \u201cfraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program.\u201d His other child care policies, his website says, \u201ccan more than be offset by additional growth,\u201d which he says his tax, trade, energy and other plans will bring about.\n\nAs we noted, the Trump campaign website acknowledges that Clinton has a child care plan, despite Trump\u2019s claim that she didn\u2019t. We reached out to the campaign for clarification of the contradictory statements, but we haven\u2019t received a response.\n\nOur fact-checking colleagues at PolitiFact.com reported that the Trump campaign had told them that by \u201cchild care,\u201d Trump was referring specifically to policies that affect children ages 0 to 4, and that maternity leave is a separate policy area. But it\u2019s not true to say that Clinton has no plans affecting children in that age range \u2013 nor did Trump make such an age stipulation when he made his claim.\n\nTrump claimed in his Sept. 13 speech that if Clinton\u2019s talk of child care \u201cever evolves into a plan it\u2019ll never get done anyway.\u201d Not being able to implement a policy \u2014 and not having a policy at all \u2014 are, of course, different things. And it\u2019s an open question whether either candidate\u2019s proposals could get through Congress, and whether the funding mechanisms the candidates have proposed can cover the cost.\n\nWe can\u2019t predict the future, as we often say, but we can note that given recent history and the positions of those in Congress, these policies face a tough road ahead.\n\nOn maternity or family leave, for instance, Clinton\u2019s plan is similar to Democratic legislation in Congress that was referred to committee in March 2015 and hasn\u2019t moved since. Trump\u2019s maternity plan was immediately met with resistance by those in both parties, as the Wall Street Journal reported. The Washington Post wrote that Trump\u2019s plan was similar to one pushed by advocates, and then President Bill Clinton, in the late 1990s called \u201cBaby UI,\u201d for \u201cunemployment insurance.\u201d\n\nAs for paying for it, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated in a June report that neither candidate had proposed ways to fully pay for all of their spending plans, but Clinton had come closer. And at that time, Trump\u2019s child care policies weren\u2019t yet part of his spending plans.\n\nClinton\u2019s early childhood education proposals would cost about $200 billion over 10 years and the paid family leave proposal would cost $300 billion, CRFB estimated. CRFB found that all of Clinton\u2019s spending proposals were $250 billion short over 10 years of being covered by her proposed tax increases.\n\nAnd that assumes that Clinton could enact the tax increases on the wealthy that she has proposed. Republican lawmakers have generally opposed enacting tax increases, although Congress in 2012 did approve bipartisan tax legislation that allowed the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for individuals earning $400,000 a year or more and couples making $450,000 or more.\n\nCRFB didn\u2019t give estimates for Trump\u2019s plans on those topics, because he hadn\u2019t yet announced them. But it still found that Trump came up $11.5 trillion short in paying for his plans over 10 years, mainly because of the tax cuts he has proposed.\n\nAs for his new child care policies, Trump claims his pro-growth policies would pay for those tax benefits. But that\u2019s far from clear. The Tax Policy Center and Tax Foundation both found Trump\u2019s tax plan didn\u2019t pay for itself. The candidate has scaled down his plan since then, and the two tax organizations haven\u2019t analyzed Trump\u2019s more recent proposals.\n\nTrump estimates his maternity leave plan would cost $2.5 billion a year, providing an average benefit of $300 a week. That\u2019s significantly less than the CRFB estimate for Clinton\u2019s family leave proposal, which would be about $30 billion per year. Trump says he would pay for his plan by reducing improper payments under the unemployment insurance program, which, the campaign puts at \u201c$5.6 billion per year.\u201d But the amount of estimated improper payments varies year to year: It\u2019s higher when total UI payments are higher, as in times of economic downturns, and lower when the program is paying out less in benefits overall.\n\nThe $5.6 billion figure was the estimate for fiscal 2014 from the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which said that was mainly due to recipients not following state laws on work search activities or \u201ccontinuing to claim UI benefits after they have returned to work.\u201d For 2015, the figure was down to $3.4 billion. The overpayments have been around 10 percent or 11 percent of total outlays over the past decade, and there has been under 1 percent in underpayments as well.\n\nSteve Ellis, vice president of the budget watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us that he\u2019s \u201calways skeptical\u201d when politicians say they\u2019ll eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. It\u2019s not possible to completely eliminate it, and how much one could reduce improper payments, Ellis says, is \u201copen to speculation.\u201d\n\nWe leave it to voters to evaluate these proposals and determine which they\u2019d support. But voters\u2019 ability to do that is hindered when one campaign falsely claims that the other has \u201cno plan.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump also incorrectly said that all of Trump\u2019s thousands of employees had a paid parental leave benefit. They don\u2019t, according to the Trump Organization and reporting by the Huffington Post.\n\nIvanka Trump made the claim in a Sept. 14 interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d:\n\nBut the policy isn\u2019t available to all of the employees of Trump\u2019s many businesses. The Huffington Post reported that employees at the \u201cTrump SoHo, New York and Miami hotels, as well as the Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, all said that they do not offer workers paid maternity leave.\u201d Huffington Post also cited an undated employee manual for the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, which said that workers could get unpaid family leave, as federal law required, and that employees must use vacation days and personal days toward that leave.\n\nA statement from the Trump Organization confirmed that not all Trump employees had paid parental leave benefits. It said the \u201cpolicies and practices \u2026 vary from property to property.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d for the weekly fact-checking video that it produces as part of a partnership with FactCheck.org that the campaign did not dispute Huffington Post\u2019s report.\n\nUpdate, Sept. 16: Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us that CRFB\u2019s estimates on savings from waste, fraud and abuse were in the hundreds of millions \u2013 not billions, as would be needed to cover Trump\u2019s maternity leave plan.\n\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget estimates savings of $1.5 billion over 10 years for improving program integrity of unemployment insurance. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, however, estimates such improvements would cost $399 million over 10 years, and bring in $170 million in revenue.", "lang": "en"}
