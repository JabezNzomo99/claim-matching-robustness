I just can\u2019t stand this. I don\u2019t want to get involved. Can you get me off?\u201d (On the tape, Clinton says the prosecutor asked if she could take the case \u201ca favor to him.\u201d)\n\nIn other words, Clinton was a court-appointed attorney, given the case despite personal objections. (As Newsday put it, \u201cHer approach, then and now, was to immerse herself in even unpleasant tasks with a will to win.\u201d) Once appointed, she aggressively defended the alleged rapist; at one point, she attacked the 12-year-old\u2019s credibility, writing in an affidavit that she had been informed \u201cthe complainant is emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and to engage in fantasizing.\u201d An investigator on the case told Newsday that there were \u201cserious inconsistencies\u201d in the victim\u2019s statements about the incident, in part because of her \u201cinfatuation\u201d with a 15-year-old boy who was also present and told authorities he had sex with her.\n\u2022 None \u201cOf course he [the defendant] claimed he didn\u2019t [rape]. All this stuff. He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.\u201d (Both Clinton and the reporter laugh)\n\u2022 None \u201cSo I got an order to see the evidence and the prosecutor didn\u2019t want me to see the evidence. I had to go to Maupin Cummings [the judge] and convince Maupin that yes indeed I had a right to see the evidence before it was presented. (Clinton laughs lightly between \u201cevidence\u201d and \u201cbefore\u201d)\n\u2022 None \u201cI handed it [a biography of her expert witness] to Mahlon Gibson, and I said, \u2018Well this guy\u2019s ready to come up from New York to prevent this miscarriage of justice.\u2019\u201d (Clinton laughs, as does the reporter)\n\u2022 None \u201cSo [judge] Maupin had to, you know, under law he was supposed to determine whether the plea was factually supported. Maupin asked me to leave the room while he examined my client so that he could find out if it was factually supported. I said \u2018Judge I can\u2019t leave the room I\u2019m his lawyer!\u2019 he said \u2018I know but I don\u2019t want to talk about this in front of you.'\u201d (Reporter says, \u201cOh God, really?\u201d And they both laugh.)\n\nThis is a famous statement by Hillary Clinton, which came after she referenced what she believed were false attacks by Republican foes: \u201cHaving seen so many of these accusations come and go, having seen people profit, you know, like Jerry Falwell, with videos, accusing my husband of committing murder, of drug running, seeing some of the things that are written and said about him, my attitude is, you know, we\u2019ve been there before, we have seen this before, and I am just going to wait patiently until the truth comes out.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
