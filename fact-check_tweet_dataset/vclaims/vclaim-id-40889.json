The claim is false; the video was published online in reports about an event in Brazil before Modi\u2019s calls for solidarity.\n\nThe 42-second video was shared on Facebook here on April 4, 2020. It has been viewed more than 2,800 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cBrazilian TV channels broadcasted Prime Minister Modi\u2019s speech and see what the Brazilians did the night before.\u201d\n\nIn a televised speech on April 3, 2020, Modi urged Indians to light lamps, candles and mobile flashlights on the evening of April 5 as a gesture of \u201ccollective resolve and solidarity\u201d during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe video of people holding lights out on the street was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here and here and on Twitter here, here and here.\n\nThe same video was shared in other posts, for example on Facebook here, here and here and in tweets here and here, alongside a different claim that the footage shows people in Switzerland participating in India\u2019s vigil.\n\nA reverse Google image search using video keyframes extracted with InVID-WeVerify, a video verification tool, found the same video was published on Facebook here on March 28, 2020, six days before Modi called for the vigil.\n\n\u201cLook in the streets of Brazil! The people are turning to Jesus in prayer and worship. Can I get an Amen?\u201d the post\u2019s caption reads.\n\nThe same video was also shared on March 27, 2020 here on a Facebook page for Christians in Brazil.\n\n\u201cOur greatest goal is to reach the promises of the god together and live together with him,\u201d reads the introduction of the Facebook page.\n\nAudible voices in the video can be heard making religious remarks in Portugese. The audio translates to English as \u201cI am in the hands of my Jesus.\u201d\n\nLocal media reports, for example here on Brazilian news site Folha Vitoria and here on the website for Brazil's Radio 93 FM, stated Brazilians took to the streets nationwide to show solidarity during the COVID-19 crisis.", "lang": "en"}
