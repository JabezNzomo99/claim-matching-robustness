The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, made a reference to the estimate in a recent speech.\n\nHe didn\u2019t give a precise time-frame for when this could happen. The Bank based its calculations on a study of jobs in the USA, which listed which types of job were at \u2018high\u2019, \u2018medium\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 risk of automation. The study made \u201cno attempt to estimate the number of jobs that will actually be automated,\u201d and judged the probabilities over \u201csome unspecified number of years\u201d.\n\nSo although the report suggested that that jobs in the high risk category such as rubbish collectors, paralegals, or receptionists might be automated, \u201crelatively soon, perhaps over the next decade or two,\u201d it didn\u2019t make any hard predictions.\n\nIt also noted some of the potential barriers to automation, including costs, regulatory worries, and political or social resistance.\n\nThese estimates aren\u2019t hard facts. Predicting what technology will look like in a few years\u2019 time is \u201cnotoriously difficult\u201d, as the authors of the report put it.\n\nWhat we can say is that economists in leading roles at the Bank of England are taking these ideas seriously, and thinking about what they mean for the future of the economy.\n\nIn one sense, replacing human labour with machines isn\u2019t anything new. There have been concerns about automation at least since the Luddite movement started smashing up factory machines in the 19th century. One difference is that this time it\u2019s also white-collar jobs like accountancy (or factchecking) rather than manual jobs that might soon be done by machines.\n\nSo far, new technology has tended to be good for workers overall. New technologies create demands for new types of products, and that means new types of jobs \u2013 often with higher wages. For example, people used to be able to get jobs as human \u2018computers\u2019 \u2013 a job now stolen by a kind of robot \u2013 but there are new kinds of jobs, like web design, which didn\u2019t exist before. In the long term, these kinds of gains are a main cause of economic growth.\n\nSo it would be a mistake to assume that there are a fixed number of jobs in the economy, some of which can be replaced by machines. Just because your job is automated won\u2019t necessarily mean you stay unemployed.\n\nBut on the other hand, you may need to retrain to do something else.\n\nNew technology is only an advantage to workers who have the skills to use it. Andy Haldane, Chief Economist at the Bank of England, has suggested that this is one reason behind the widening gap between high and low wages we saw in the 20th century.\n\nNo-one knows what the future looks like. But it\u2019s true that leading economists are thinking seriously about things like machine learning, what that means for our idea of jobs and work, and the future of capitalism.", "lang": "en"}
