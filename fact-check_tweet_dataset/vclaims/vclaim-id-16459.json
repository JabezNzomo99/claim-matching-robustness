Francis Pangilinan, chair of the committee on electoral reforms and people\u2019s participation, does not support the claim.\n\nA screengrab of his slide titled \u201cPoorest Provinces are Rich\u2026 in Fat Dynasties\u201d shows a list of the 15 poorest provinces in the country and details about their respective political dynasties.\n\nThe list does not match the provinces enumerated in the Robredo speech transcript.\n\nThe poorest provinces in Mendoza\u2019s presentation are Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Northern Samar, Saranggani, Sulu, Bukidnon, Siquijor, Zamboanga del Norte, Sultan Kudarat, Agusan del Sur, Western Samar, Eastern Samar, Masbate, Negros Oriental and Lanao del Norte.\n\nA January 2017 working paper \u201cDynasties Thrive under Decentralization in the Philippines\u201d authored by Mendoza and Miann S. Banaag contains almost the same statement in the Robredo transcript, except for the part about dynastic provinces consistently ranking among the poorest:\n\nIn his Senate presentation, Mendoza showed a link to the website \u201cBuilding an Inclusive Democracy,\u201d which contains information on the proportion of elected officials occupied by dynasties per province.\n\nDetails here also do not match the provinces mentioned in the Robredo speech transcript.\n\nOnly seven are in the top ten: Maguindanao, 64 percent dynasty share, 1st; Batangas, 62 percent, 2nd; Sulu, 62 percent, 3rd; Ilocos Norte, 61 percent, 4th; Lanao del Sur, 59 percent, 6th; Pampanga, 61 percent, 5th, Bulacan, 59 percent, 7th.\n\nPangasinan, 55 percent dynasty share, and Nueva Ecija, 53 percent, are 13th and 18th respectively.\n\nRizal, 50 percent dynasty share, is outside the top 20 provinces at 23rd.\n\nUPDATE: The Office of the Vice President, in a letter to LSE associate professor James Putzel, has apologized for the mix up.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that there was an inadvertent misinterpretation of the list that was presented in the (Mendoza) study, which was integrated in the speech,\" the letter read.\n\n\"The study enumerated the same ten provinces for being part of the Top 20 Most Dynastic Philippine Provinces from 2004 to 2016, not for being part of the Top 20 Poorest Provinces,\" it added.\n\nThe letter also said the office has \"instituted the necessary corrective action to prevent similar incidents in the future.\"\n\nOffice of the Vice President, Overcoming Poverty in the Philippines and the Role of Politics in Economic Development, Transcript of speech by Leni Robredo, London School of Economics and Political Science, April 6, 2018\n\nSenate of the Philippines, Committee on Electoral Reforms and People\u2019s Participation, Hearing on Anti-Political Dynasty Act, February 15, 2018\n\nMendoza, R & Banaag MS 2017, \u201cDynasties Thrive under Decentralization in the Philippines Ronald U.
