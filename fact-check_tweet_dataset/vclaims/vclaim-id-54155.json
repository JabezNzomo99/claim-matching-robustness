The air conditioning device is not \u201ccost-free\u201d and appears to be sold by a Hong Kong-based company.\n\nThe video, titled \u201cHow To Cool Any Room Without Expensive AC,\u201d tells the story of a supposed orphan named Billy from Albuquerque, New Mexico, who allegedly designed a \u201ccost-free\u201d portable device that can quickly and effectively cool rooms.\n\n\u201cA 15 year old just destroyed the billion dollar air-con industry with a device that pumps out ice-cool air for barely a dime,\u201d text in the video states, showing footage of the purported young inventor. \u201cAfter word got out about what he\u2019d made\u2026 top colleges fought for the chance to give him a scholarship.\u201d\n\nWhile the device, called the Blaux Portable AC, is a real air conditioning unit, it is not \u201ccost-free\u201d and appears to sell for about $125, according to the official website. The backstory of it being invented by a 15-year-old orphan appears to have been fabricated. No mention of Billy is included on the company website. Nor did an internet search by the Daily Caller find any credible record of a 15-year-old orphan inventing such an air conditioning unit.\n\nThe footage of the young person identified as Billy in the video was actually taken from a short 2013 YouTube documentary about a computer programmer named Santiago Gonzalez, who was a 14-year-old student at the Colorado School of Mines at the time of filming. Gonzalez\u2019s parents appear in the documentary, proving that he wasn\u2019t an orphan.\n\nGonzalez, whose Twitter profile now lists him as 22 years old, replied to a tweet on July 5 about misuse of the documentary\u2019s footage, saying, \u201cApparently I\u2019m also an orphan from Albuquerque; crazy how these scammers know more about my life than me.\u201d (RELATED: Did An 11 Year-Old \u2018Shark Tank\u2019 Contestant Invent A Device To Give The World Free Wi-Fi?)\n\nThe Blaux Portable AC appears to be sold by the Hong Kong-based company Strong Current Enterprises Limited.
