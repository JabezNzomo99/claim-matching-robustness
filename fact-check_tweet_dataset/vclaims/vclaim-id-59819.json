Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video showing Pakistani national flags being waved at a rally of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. Fact: The flags seen in the rally of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot are not Pakistan national flags. In the Pakistan national flag, along with a green field with a large white crescent and star, at the hoist end, there will be a vertical white stripe. But the flags seen in the video do not have any such vertical stripe. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we subjected the screenshots of the video to reverse image search technique, the same video was found on the Facebook page of Ashok Gehlot. The video was posted by Ashok Gehlot in November 2018 and states that Gehlot had flagged off a procession in Jodhpur organized on the occasion of Milad-un-nabi. The video posted by Gehlot is much clearer and it can be seen that the flags seen in the rally have a green field with a large white crescent and star on them. Those flags are Islamic flags, not Pakistani national flags. For a Pakistan national flag, along with a green field with a large white crescent and star, at the hoist end, there will be a vertical white stripe. Several photos of the Pakistan flag can be seen on \u2018Alamy\u2019 stock photo website.\n\nTo sum it up, flags seen in the rally of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot are not Pakistani National flags.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
