The claim is false and the man shown in the post is not a police officer.\n\nThe November 28, 2018 Facebook post shares a photo it claims shows one of the three policemen involved in the 2017 shooting death of Kian delos Santos in Manila, which led to protests against President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s drug war.\n\nPolice claimed Santos fired at them while resisting arrest but CCTV footage showed the unarmed 17-year-old being dragged off by two officers moments before he was shot dead.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe text on the photo, when translated to English, says: \u201cProof! This is the man who shot Kian! Look! He's a police scalawag of the Yellows! with FAKE VP.\n\n\u201cYellows\u201d refers to the opposition Liberal Party and \u201cFake VP\u201d is a reference to the Philippines\u2019 Vice President Leni Robredo, the woman on the left of the picture.\n\nUnder Philippine law the president and vice president are elected separately. Robredo is from the opposition Liberal Party (LP) and is one of Duterte\u2019s staunchest critics.\n\nThe post adds: \u201cLP is the one behind EJKS (illegal drug war killings) in the country, evidence shows!\u201d\n\nThe claims in the misleading Facebook post first appeared online in August 2017, soon after the Santos killing sparked protests.\n\nHere is a screenshot of one August 21, 2017 Facebook post:\n\nThe post, which has the same photo of a man with Robredo, says: \u201cThis is said to be the police who shot Kian delos Santos\u201d.\n\nThe caption adds: \u201cthis is the police who shot your son, he is with fake VP Leni.. you be the judge\u2026\u201d\n\nThe photograph used in the misleading Facebook post was taken in Angono town, near Manila, local authorities said in a statement.\n\nThe misleading post is \u201cfake news\u201d, they said, adding that the image was taken at their offices when Robredo visited during her 2016 campaign.\n\nThe man in the photo is actually local resident Alberto Florentino III, local authorities in Angono said in a separate statement.\n\nHe is not a policeman, the Philippine National Police told AFP.\n\n\u201cNo, we don't have an Alberto Florentino III,\u201d police spokesman Benigno Durana Jr. said.\n\nThe three police officers convicted in November 2018 for Delos Santos\u2019 killing were: Arnel Oares, Jeremias Pereda and Jerwin Cruz.\n\nFlorentino has filed a cybercrime complaint over the misleading post which claims he was involved in the Delos Santos killing.\n\nIn a report from local broadcaster ABS-CBN he speaks about his experience since the post first surfaced:\n\nHe says: \"I haven't slept yet. I've been thinking about my family, they could be hurt. Some may believe I was the one who did the killing. It's scary.\u201d\n\nThe misleading Facebook post has been shared more than 1,700 times since it was posted November 28, 2018.", "lang": "en"}
