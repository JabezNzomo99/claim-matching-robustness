This means a total of 24 CAs were granted but liquidated \"beyond the prescribed dates of liquidation\" which is December 31, 2017. Five Accountable Officers were also granted CAs despite having unliquidated CAs previously.\n\nIn a May 11 Philippine News Agency (PNA) report, PCOO Audit team Supervising Auditor Edna Salaguban said in a letter to former Communications Usec Noel Puyat that COA \u201c(does) not have any knowledge on an ongoing investigation of a P647.11 million fund.\u201d This was also reported by Inquirer on May 18.\n\nPuyat had officially resigned on May 30 and denied any anomalies in the spending of the ASEAN Summit budget. He added that there were an unspent P600 million in the ASEAN budget but PCOO has returned it to the National Treasury.\n\nFor Cayetano's alleged P1-billion \"unliquidated fund,\" there are no mentions of this in COA\u2019s 2017 annual audit report on the Department of Foreign Affairs. In the COA report\u2019s Observation and Recommendations section, there were no significant findings on unliquidated funds. Cayetano assumed office as DFA Secretary in May 2017.\n\nUson has resigned on October 3 after lawmakers, citizens\u2019 groups and Uson\u2019s own colleagues at the PCOO called on her to step down or for President Rodrigo Duterte to fire her. She then filed a bid to run as a party-list representative in the May 2019 polls.", "lang": "en"}
