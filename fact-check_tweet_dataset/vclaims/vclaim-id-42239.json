The traffic policeman came and started hitting him on the head...he also started asking for Rs 500.\"\n\nThe same video was uploaded on Youtube by the same page on April 21, 2018.\n\nBOOM also contacted the Udhampur police who denied that any such incident had happened in the protests that broke out on February 15 of this year. Speaking to BOOM, Rajiv Pandey, Senior Superitendent of Police, Udhampur said, \"The video that is circulating is old and no such incident has been reported in Udhampur.\" He added that the video circulating is fake.\"\n\nBOOM further found that The Jammu and Kashmir police on February 16, 2019, had put out a tweet quoting the Senior Superintendent of Police of Udhampur alerting people about rumors being spread about an attack on Kashmir based drivers/vehicles at Udhampur.", "lang": "en"}
