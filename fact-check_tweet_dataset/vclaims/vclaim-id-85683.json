A few days ago he had stolen the tongs (chimta) of one of the sadhus for which he had been reprimanded on Monday. He was asked to return the tong. There was no motive or enmity. The accused is from the same village where the temple is,\" Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar Singh told BOOM.\n\nThe SSP also told BOOM that in his confession the accused had said that he had come to the temple at around 10 pm on Monday, saw a stick kept on the premises and then 'according to the orders of god' he battered them to death. Later he hid in the neighboring area.\n\nSingh also told us that the priests were attacked with a stick and not a sharp weapon as claimed in several news reports.\n\n\"On the evening of the murder, villagers saw Murari roaming around with a sword. Since he is an addict and indulges in such acts quite often, villagers did not bother. But, when they saw blood at the temple on Tuesday morning, they thought Murari might have killed the sadhus with the sword. However, he later told us in his confession that the murder weapon was a wooden stick\", the SSP said.\n\n\n\nBulandshahr police also tweeted about the incident from their verified twitter handle.", "lang": "en"}
