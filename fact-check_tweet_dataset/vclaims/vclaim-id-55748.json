But, \u2018FACTLY\u2019 has found the claim to be false. As per 13 February 2020 article of \u2018Times of India\u2019, the video shows birds flocking together at a riverfront in Ahmedabad (Gujarat). So, the video is not from Chandigarh (Punjab) and is of an incident prior to the announcement of nationwide lockdown which came into effect from 25 March 2020.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
