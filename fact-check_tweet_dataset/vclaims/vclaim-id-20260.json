The claim is false; the photo has been manipulated to change a positive message in the banner about the revolution.\n\nMultiple posts, such as this one and this one \u2013 both published on February 26, 2019, and each shared around 240 times since \u2013 contain a photo showing people standing beside a highway overpass with a banner.\n\nThe text on the banner, translated into English, says in capital letters: \"We are EDSA. United people's action\".\n\nEDSA refers to the \"People Power\" revolution that ended the two-decade rule of Marcos on February 25, 1986. Here is a Philippine government website about the revolution.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:\n\nIn the doctored image, the first letter of each word on the banner appears in yellow and the rest of each word is written in white.\n\nThe letters highlighted in yellow spell out the Filipino profanity \"tae\", which means \"shit\" in English.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says in Filipino: \"You're the one who said it yourselves! You even have a banner!!! You even highlighted it!!! EDSA is SHIT!!!!\"\n\nHowever the banner did not have the letters 'T', 'A' and 'E' highlighted in yellow. AFP tracked down multiple images of the banner with the same people at the same event in which those letters are not highlighted.\n\nThose images show the event was held on February 23, 2019, and that the banner celebrated the revolution rather than criticised it.\n\nOne of those images was shared in this tweet posted on February 23, 2019, by the small political party Kabataan, which represents Filipino youth.\n\nThe tweet, translated into English, says: \"WE ARE EDSA! WE ARE THE HOPE! FIGHT THE DICTATORSHIP! Different sectors from the ranks of students, workers, peasants and the church came together to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of EDSA People Power 1.\"\n\nIn the photo from the Kabataan tweet, the people holding the banner appear in the same location wearing the same clothes. However the banner text does not include letters in yellow.\n\nThe image in the doctored banner and the one from the Kabataan tweet are shown below:\n\nThe Union of Catholic Asian News, a Catholic news site in the Philippines, also published a similar photo in this report dated February 26, 2019.\n\nThat image shows people in white religious dress carrying a blue banner with white text in front of an overpass.\n\n\"Priests, nuns and seminarians lead a protest march reminiscent of the 1986 'people power' uprising in Manila on Feb 23,\" the photo caption in the article says.\n\nA search using online tool IntelTechniques found a third example of the banner's original appearance in this video, published February 27, 2019, on the Facebook page of Altermidya or The People\u2019s Alternative Media Network.\n\nThe people holding the banner \u2013 with no yellow letters spelling out \"tae\" \u2013 appear four seconds into the video, as seen in the screenshot below:\n\nComments on the misleading Facebook post, such as the two below, indicate that some people believed the banner really did criticise the 1986 revolution.\n\nTranslated to English, the comment below says: \"It's all written by them\u2026. They themselves are the ones who said what they are hahaha\u2026.. But they don't know it\u2026\"\n\nAnd this comment below, translated to English, says: \"That is where you will see how intelligent those people are in white. Maybe they probably thought long and hard about the design of the banner? I wonder how much is the cost of having that banner made. It's a good reminder to all. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha!\"", "lang": "en"}
