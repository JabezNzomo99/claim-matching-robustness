Unfortunately, some of these pleas are misleading. Among recent instances, one that went viral shows a man and a woman weeping while holding an unconscious child. The message on the picture reads that the child is suffering from cancer and needs financial aid.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\n\n\nIndia Today Fact Check found that the message attached to the picture is totally false as the child died in August this year due to pneumonia in Bihar\u2019s Siwan district.\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: Obama never said terrorist attacks impossible in India till Modi is PM\n\nThe picture is shared by a Facebook user, Manish Jaiswal, in the public group - WE SUPPORT PM MODI - which has more than 22 lakh members.

According to them, the child was undergoing treatment at Dinesh Nursing Home in Siwan, where he died in August this year. The reports said that according to the family, the child died due to wrong medication. However, doctors claimed that the child was brought dead at the nursing home.\n\n\n\nNone of the reports said that the child was suffering from cancer.

He denied the claim that the child was suffering from cancer. Our local correspondent also confirmed the news.\n\n\n\nWe also tried to contact Manish Jaiswal regarding the post but didn\u2019t receive any response. Jaiswal claims himself to be a businessman from Mumbai but belongs to Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh. \n\n\n\nSensitive and emotional posts like this on social media are often used as click baits as such posts generate huge number of interactions.\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: Don't trust the viral message about no toll charges for 12 hours journey\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: Truth behind this viral picture depicting farm distress", "lang": "en"}
