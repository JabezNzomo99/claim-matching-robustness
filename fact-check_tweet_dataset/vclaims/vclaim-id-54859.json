The posts are misleading; the first numbers of a barcode indicate the country in which the company registered for the label prefix, they do not represent where the item was produced.\n\n\u201cWith all the food and pet products now coming from China, it is best to make sure you read the label,\u201d claims one version of the posts shared thousands of times since mid-April 2020. \u201cBUY USA & CANADIAN MADE by watching for \u20180\u2019 at the beginning of the number,\u201d it claims.\n\n\u201cVery simple: Pick up a product. Look at the barcode. If the first 3 numbers are 690 or 691 or 692, the product was made in China,\u201d claims another version of the posts which implore people to \u201cBuy American.\u201d\n\nThe misinformation is not new -- fact-checking organization Snopes addressed the topic as far back as 2008 -- but according to social media monitor CrowdTangle, posts making these claims have been shared thousands of times in North America in April 2020 including, on Facebook here, here and here and on Instagram here and here.\n\nThe posts surfaced as US states and Canadian provinces ordered residents to stay at home, causing huge spikes in unemployment, but they do not accurately explain barcode prefixes.\n\n\u201cThe information being spread is inaccurate,\u201d according to Shannon Sullivan, senior director for public relations at GS1 US, a non-profit organization that issues company prefixes for barcodes.\n\nCompanies wishing to create a Global Trade Item Number to uniquely identify products through barcoding must register for a company prefix.\n\n\u201cThe company prefix does not determine the country in which a product was manufactured \u2013 it only indicates the country where the company prefix was obtained,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThis was confirmed by Andy Verb, president and owner of Bar Code Graphics, Inc.\n\n\u201cWhere the product is sourced is not a factor with GS1 company prefixes,\u201d Verb told AFP by email.\n\nThis list details the prefixes assigned to different countries, but clearly states: \u201cNote that since GS1 member companies can manufacture products anywhere in the world, GS1 prefixes do not identify the country of origin for a given product.\u201d\n\nConsumers wanting to buy American products can look for a \u201cMade in America\u201d designation on a product. The US Federal Trade Commission oversees companies to ensure they comply with standards to market their products as \u201cMade in America.\u201d\n\nIn Canada there are separate guidelines for companies wishing to make \u201cProduct of Canada\u201d or \u201cMade in Canada\u201d claims. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said: \u201cProducts that contain foreign ingredients, regardless of their source, are not eligible to bear a \u2018Product of Canada\u2019 claim.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
