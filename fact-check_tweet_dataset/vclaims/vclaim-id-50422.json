{"title": "UP Police Debunk False Communal Claim About Meat Thrown At A Temple", "subtitle": "Hathras Police has debunked any communal angle to the incident.", "author": "www.boomlive.in", "date": "2020-03-11T18:46:52+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-50422", "url": "https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/up-police-debunk-false-communal-claim-about-meat-thrown-at-a-temple-7180", "vclaim": "Social media posts claiming local Muslims in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras district threw pieces of raw meat at a temple, are false with the police itself debunking the communal rumour.\n\nDismissing any communal angle to the incident, Hathras police clarified that a local chicken shop owner had discarded poultry waste in a dustbin and stray dogs in the area had dragged the carcasses out.\n\n\n\nA 30-second clip showing a stray dog pick at pieces of raw meat strewn across a street as police officials and people gathered nearby look on, is doing the rounds of Twitter and Facebook with the false claim.\n\n\n\nThe claim in Hindi, translates to the following: \"Muslims have thrown pieces of meat at a holy temple site of Hindus in Nai Ka Nagla colony, Janpad Hathras where the population is mixed. Till when will Hindu temples will be treated this way?? @Banswal_IPS @dgpup @igrangeagra @digrangealigarh @Uppolice @myogiadityanath\"\n\nThe post can be accessed below.\n\nThe screenshot of the above tweet has been shared on Facebook as well.\n\nBOOM looked at the comments section of the tweet and found a reply of UP Police tagging Hathras Police to take action on the incident mentioned in the viral tweet. In response, Hathras police replied that it had taken cognizance of the incident and deployed a team to investigate the same.\n\nUttar Pradesh's tweet can be seen below, which translates to @hathraspolice this is to inform and to take immediate action.\n\nThe probe, however, found no communal angle to the incident and the Hathras police tweeted refuting the viral claim.\n\n\n\nThe Hathras police wrote, \"The above information has been refuted by Hathras police\"\n\nBelow is a translation of police's statement\n\n\n\nA video is being circulated on social media in which a claim accusing Muslims has been made that the Muslims have thrown pieces of meat at a holy temple site of the Hindus in Nai Ka Nagla colony in Hathras Janpad. When the area in-charge visited the incident site, they found that it was not meat but chicken pieces that have been dragged by dogs from a dustbin. No information from any source has been received regarding that the Muslims have thrown meat at a holy temple of Hindus. Police also found waste material thrown by someone (a shopkeeper) in a dustbin.\n\nTherefore, Hathras police are denying the claim.\n\nIt is not clear whether there is a temple in the vicinity as the video does not show the same.\n\nThe visual investigation by BOOM shows and one can see a pile of garbage later in the video. This substantiates the police verification that stray dogs dragged the pieces of meat on to the road. \n\n\n\nThe photo above shows that the pieces of raw meat are in fact discarded poultry. The photo below is a screengrab of the viral video when the person who shot it turned around. It shows garbage and a stray dog in the frame.", "lang": "en"}
