Of course not, that story was a complete work of fiction from a satirical website.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on March 30, 2018 by World News Daily Report under the headline \"Nursing home employee addicted to sex force-fed elderly with Viagra\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nOklahoma City, OK | A former Oklahoma City nursing home aide has been arrested and charged with sexually assaulting multiple nursing home residents.\n\nGiselle Horney, 49, a nursing home aid at Parkview Nursing Center, has been arrested this week after multiple allegations of sexual assault and abuse. The abuses occurred during a three-year time period on the behalf of over 78 residents, male and female, aged from 72 to 103 years of age. Horney is also accused of having given Viagra on a daily basis to a number of residents before forcing them into sexual intercourse without their consent.\n\nThe story was properly formatted to look like a real news article when viewed in isolation on social media:\n\nAccording to mugshots.com the woman in the picture is actually Elizabeth Starr McAllister-Stafford and she...\n\nSo, not a nurse, not in Oklahoma, not Giselle Horney.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are some other hoaxes they published recently:\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Suffer Heart Attack After Eating 21 Burritos, Did NOT Sue Taco Bell for $4M\n\u2022 Fake News: New Zealand Emu farmer NOT Arrested For Running Illegal Animal Brothel\n\u2022 Fake News: Cops Did NOT Beat Up Teen After Bank Teller Mistakes His Erection For A Pistol\n\u2022 Fake News: 101-Year-Old Woman Did NOT Give Birth To Her 17th Baby in Italy\n\u2022 Fake News: Teenager Did NOT Accidentally Chop Off His Genitals During Sex With A Blender\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.

Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.", "lang": "en"}
