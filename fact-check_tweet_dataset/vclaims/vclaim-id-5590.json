Mike Huckabee, have made similar claims.\n\nBut FBI Director James Comey has said that the FBI over the course of two preliminary investigations in 2013 and 2014 recorded Mateen\u2019s conversations, followed him, introduced him to confidential sources, interviewed him, \u201creview[ed] transactional records from his communications, and search[ed] all government holdings for any possible connections.\u201d Both investigations closed without the FBI taking any action against Mateen, because, Comey said, there was no reason at that time to suspect Mateen had terrorist ties or intentions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also going to look hard at our own work to see whether there is something we should have done differently,\u201d Comey said at a June 13 press briefing. \u201cSo far, the honest answer is: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t see anything in reviewing our work that our agents should have done differently, but we\u2019ll look at it in an open and honest way, and be transparent about it.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed for USA Today, Chris Cox \u2014 who heads the NRA\u2019s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action \u2014 explained why the NRA opposes new gun-control measures \u2014 particularly the reinstatement of a federal ban on certain military-style, semi-automatic firearms \u2014 in response to the nation\u2019s worst mass shooting in modern history on June 12 in Orlando. Of course, Cox has a right to that opinion.\n\nBut in stating his case, Cox makes an unsubstantiated claim about the FBI\u2019s prior contact with Mateen, a U.S.-born Muslim who pledged allegiance to the terrorist Islamic State on the night of the attack.\n\nWe asked NRA-ILA spokeswoman Amy Hunter what evidence Cox has that political correctness prevented the FBI from fully investigating Mateen. We have yet to receive a response, and we will update our article if we do.\n\nBut what we know so far does not support Cox\u2019s claim, and in fact contradicts it.\n\nAt his June 13 press briefing, the FBI director said the agency became aware of Mateen in May 2013, when Mateen was working as a security guard at a local court house.\n\n\u201cHe made some statements that were inflammatory and contradictory that concerned his co-workers about terrorism,\u201d Comey said. \u201cFirst, he claimed family connections to al Qaeda. He also said that he was a member of Hezbollah, which is a Shia terrorist organization that is a bitter enemy of the so-called Islamic State, ISIL. He said he hoped that law enforcement would raid his apartment and assault his wife and child so that he could martyr himself.\u201d\n\nMateen\u2019s odd behavior was reported to the FBI, and its Miami office opened a preliminary investigation. Under its Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide, the FBI must complete its preliminary investigation in six months, although it can get an extension of up to six additional months.\n\nComey said the first investigation in 2013 lasted 10 months, so it must have received an extension.\n\n\u201cOur investigation involved introducing confidential sources to him, recording conversations with him, following him, reviewing transactional records from his communications, and searching all government holdings for any possible connections, any possible derogatory information,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then interviewed him twice. He admitted making the statements that his co-workers reported, but explained that he did it in anger because he thought his co-workers were discriminating against him and teasing him because he was Muslim. After 10 months of investigation, we closed the preliminary investigation.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the preliminary investigation closed after 10 months indicates that the agency felt its investigation was completed. FBI rules discourage conducting preliminary investigations beyond a year, but a longer extension can be approved \u201cby the appropriate FBIHQ operational section for \u2018good cause.'\u201d\n\nDon Borelli, a retired FBI counterterrorism supervisor in New York, told the New York Times that the danger in keeping an investigation open without good cause is the impact that it can have on innocent people. \u201cImagine if you can\u2019t get a job because you\u2019re on some watchlist and there\u2019s no basis for it,\u201d Borelli told the Times.\n\nOr imagine that someone cannot buy a gun because he or she is on a terrorist watch list and there\u2019s no basis for it.\n\nIn fact, that is the very argument that the NRA chief lobbyist makes in response to gun-control advocates who want to give the attorney general the power to prevent people from buying guns if they are on the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Watchlist \u2014 which, as we have written, contains about 800,000 names, including foreigners and U.S. citizens. (Mateen, a U.S. citizen, was on the watch list while under FBI investigation.) In a press release issued June 15, Cox said that \u201cdue process protections should be put in place that allow law-abiding Americans who are wrongly put on a watchlist to be removed.\u201d\n\nTwo months after it closed its preliminary investigation of Mateen, the FBI opened a second one after discovering that he knew a Florida man who carried out a suicide mission in Syria. That was in July 2014.\n\n\u201cOur Miami office was investigating the Florida man who had blown himself up for the Nusra Front in Syria. Again, the Nusra Front being a group in conflict with ISIL. We learned from the investigation that the killer knew him casually from attending the same mosque in that area of Florida,\u201d Comey said. \u201cOur investigation turned up no ties of any consequence between the two of them.\u201d\n\nComey said the FBI again interviewed Mateen \u201cto find out whether he had any significant contacts with the suicide bomber,\u201d and determined that he did not, and that ended the second investigation. We asked the FBI how long that investigation lasted and whether any other investigative actions were taken, besides interviewing Mateen, but \u200bit declined to comment beyond Comey\u2019s earlier remarks.\n\nWe understand that there are legitimate questions of the FBI. On CNN\u2019s \u201cAt This Hour,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham also questioned why the FBI closed its investigation. \u201cWhat do you have to do to stay on the terrorist watch list? What are the criteria to close a file? To me, I want to know the answer to that question,\u201d he said.\n\nFair enough. But Cox goes too far \u2014 and Huckabee even further \u2014 in blaming political correctness without any evidence.\n\nIn a June 14 blog post, Huckabee said that \u201cpolitical correctness kills, and it just set a new US record.\u201d\n\nThere is simply no evidence to support such a claim.\n\nClarification, June 16: This article was updated to clarify that Chris Cox is executive director of the NRA\u2019s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, and Amy Hunter is its spokeswoman.", "lang": "en"}
