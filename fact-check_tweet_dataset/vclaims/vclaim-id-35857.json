The performance is a commentary on human nature and God.", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Feb 12, 2020 10:48 AM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-35857", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/photos-chinese-man-having-human-baby-soup-improve-health", "vclaim": "In the photos, the man appears to be taking a bite at the baby\u2019s body. The pictures were purportedly evidence that Chinese eat fetuses to \u201cimprove their health and boost sexual performance.\u201d\n\nAccording to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, the link had been shared on Facebook as early as March 2019. However, the content was shared by several pages and in groups again in 2020 following the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak. It has since accumulated 10,511 total interactions as of writing.\n\nThe man eating a baby in the photos was Zhu himself. A 2003 BBC article said the performance was titled \u201cEating People\u201d and was originally shown at the Third Shanghai Biennale in China.\n\nAn excerpt of the documentary is available on ZCZ Films\u2019 official YouTube account. The excerpt described Zhu\u2019s act as \u201ca performance piece.\u201d It is unclear whether or not the fetus in the photos was real, but the excerpt said that Zhu later revealed that \u201cthis was all faked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of it this way \u2013 humans have their own moral standards and our behavior is regulated by these values. Our subconscious tells us that eating babies is not right\u2026 but on the other hand, it is not prohibited by any law. So I wrote a statement saying that no religion forbids cannibalism,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cI took advantage of this space between morality and the law and based my work on it.\u201d \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
