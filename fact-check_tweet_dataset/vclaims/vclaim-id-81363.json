The video is being shared in a misleading context; the first section of the video shows shoppers queuing outside a shoe shop in mainland China; the rest of the video shows guests queuing at a hotel in Macau.\n\nThe 15-second video was published here on Twitter on June 16, 2019 where it has been viewed more than 44,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of this misleading tweet:\n\nThe traditional Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201cHong Kong citizens are crowding to exchange cash of U.S. dollars from Chinese banks and cancel their Chinese bank accounts! As long as we withdraw $10,000 per person, we would almost drain the U.S. dollar cash within the Hong Kong market, then would put the Hong Kong dollar and the Renminbi in crisis. Such a punch is as powerful as millions of people protesting on the street!\u201d\n\nThe video was shared the same day a mass protest was held in Hong Kong over a controversial extradition law which would allow some criminal suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China. Here is an AFP story about the protest published on June 16, 2019.\n\nThe same video and a similar claim was viewed tens of thousands of times on Twitter here and on Facebook here.\n\nThe claim is false; the first section of the video shows shoppers queuing outside a shoe shop in mainland China; the rest of the video shows guests queuing at a hotel in Macau.\n\nThe first three seconds of the video in the misleading posts shows dozens of people gathering outside a building.\n\nComments by social media users on the misleading posts suggest it was filmed outside a Jordan shoe store in Changzhou, Jiangsu province in eastern China.\n\nAFP found the same store listed on Chinese online directory dianping.com here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video (L) and the photo posted by a user on dianping.com (R):\n\nThis photo was published on the Injoy shopping mall\u2019s official Weibo account on June 11, 2018, of a crowd queuing for shoes at the same Jordan store.\n\nThe Weibo post\u2019s simplified Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201c#AJ1# The crowded signing up scene outside the store is really unusual for a rainy day. A lot of people came early in the morning, but the shoes are really cool.\u201d\n\nBelow are two screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the Weibo photos (R):\n\nFrom the four second mark to 15 second mark in the video in the misleading posts, a group of people can be seen queuing inside an elaborately decorated building.\n\nComments on the misleading posts suggested the building was The Parisian Macao hotel.\n\nAFP found a corresponding photo of the hotel\u2019s lobby published in this post by The Parisian Macao\u2019s official Facebook account on April 11, 2019.\n\nThe bilingual caption in part says: \u201cCapture beautiful shots of 35-metre-high rotunda, hand-painted renderings at hotel reception and concierge, and dramatic sculptures!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo showing the lobby:\n\nBelow are two screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the photo posted by the hotel (R):", "lang": "en"}
