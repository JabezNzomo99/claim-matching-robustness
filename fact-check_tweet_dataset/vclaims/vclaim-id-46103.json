To be exact, according to Trump\u2019s financial disclosure for 2018 \u201chis three family trusts each had investments in a Dodge & Cox mutual fund, whose largest holding was in Sanofi.\u201d\n\nConfusion over how best to interpret the numbers quickly flooded Twitter, with some overplaying the significance of Trump\u2019s investments:\n\nOthers incorrectly suggested that Trump\u2019s investment in Sanofi could be as low as $99:\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s most recent Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report reveals that, as of the end of 2018, Trump had invested in two different Dodge & Cox funds: the Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund and the Dodge & Cox Income Fund. The Income Fund is comprised of a portfolio of mainly \u201chigh-quality bonds and other debt securities,\u201d whereas the International Stock Fund \u201cinvests primarily in a diversified portfolio of equity securities issued by non-U.S. companies from at least three different countries.\u201d It is the International Fund that has a stake in Sanofi, and Trump\u2019s disclosure states that his three family trusts each have investments valued between $1,001 and $15,000 in the International Fund. Dodge & Cox\u2019s website states that a minimum initial investment of $2,500 is required, putting Trump\u2019s total investment in the fund somewhere between $7,500 and $45,000.\n\nDespite being the fund\u2019s largest holding, Sanofi shares represented only 3.3 percent of the International Fund\u2019s investments at the end of 2019. If the president\u2019s level of investment hasn\u2019t changed, he has at most $1,485 invested in Sanofi and possibly as little as $247.50.\n\nMarketWatch pointed out that the Trump trusts contain other funds that have a stake in Sanofi. His three family trusts also contain investments in iShares MSCI EAFE Index, each falling in the $15,001 to $50,000 range, and iShares Core MSCI EAF ETF, which has an investment in the $1,001 to $15,000 range in Family Trust 1 and investments in the $15,001 to $50,000 range in Family Trusts 2 and 3.\n\nBased on the information from Trump\u2019s 2018 fiscal year disclosure, his total investment in iShares MSCI EAFE Index ranged between $45,003 and $150,000. Given that, as of April 6, .91 percent of the fund\u2019s holdings are in Sanofi, Trump\u2019s financial interest in Sanofi through this fund is at least $409.53 and possibly as high as $1,365.\n\nLess than 1 percent\u2014.78 percent to be exact\u2014of iShares Core MSCI EAF ETF\u2019s holdings were in Sanofi as of April 6, meaning that of the $31,003 to $115,000 Trump has in the fund, between $241.82 and $897 are invested in Sanofi.\n\nTotaling all of these figures, Trump\u2019s financial interest in Sanofi is at most $3,747 and could be as low as $898.85. It\u2019s important to note that this is based on the most recent information on Trump\u2019s investments available, meaning it is not necessarily an accurate reflection of what Trump\u2019s investments currently look like. Provided Trump\u2019s investments have not changed much since the end of 2018, and assuming that those disclosures are accurate, Trump\u2019s investment in the French company does not represent a significant portion of his net worth.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
