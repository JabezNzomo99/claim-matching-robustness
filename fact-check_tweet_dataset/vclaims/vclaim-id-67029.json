The claim originates from a satire website.\n\nPelosi, who currently is running for reelection as the representative of California\u2019s 12th congressional district and serves as House speaker, is often the subject of dubious claims online. This particular Facebook post alleges Pelosi said she would resign if Trump wins reelection in November.\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to support the post\u2019s claim. If Pelosi had made such an announcement, it would be reported on by national news media, yet the DCNF found no such reports. There are also no similar comments on her social media pages.\n\nIn fact, in an Aug. 23 interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, Pelosi said \u201cof course\u201d she would accept the results of November\u2019s presidential election as legitimate no matter who wins.

In January, Check Your Fact debunked the claim that Pelosi said, \u201cIf impeachment fails, I will immediately resign.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
