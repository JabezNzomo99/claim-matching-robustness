The people and organizations mentioned have not been charged with war crimes.\n\nAt first glance, the document appears authentic. The letterhead includes two official-looking seals, while also claiming to be from the \u201cHuman Rights Tribunal International\u201d of the U.S. government.\n\nIt alleges to be a notice of acknowledgment for documents filed related to \u201cthe matter of The Government of The United States v Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, Anthony Fauci, Christine Grady, Tedros Adhanom, National Governors Association, CDC, WHO, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\u201d It later states the case involves alleged \u201cwar crimes with intent to commit mass genocide.\u201d\n\nHowever, a closer inspection of the document reveals that it is not genuine. The U.S. does not have such a tribunal, and the notice uses language atypical of legal documents such as \u201c49th Day, Year of Yahweh, 6022\u201d for the date.\n\nThe notice also provides two dubious websites to access the alleged case documents: reignoftheheavens.com and humanrightstribunal.international. The latter website, which is insecure, explains on one page that \u201cthe present Human Rights Tribunal started within the Reign of the Heavens before it was placed in trust,\u201d further adding to its dubiousness.\n\nHad any of the people or organizations been charged with war crimes, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet no reporting could be found.
