No, that's not true: The law in question applies only to documents that are considered official government records - not copies of speeches, like the one Pelosi had in hand. Pelosi will not face charges under the federal law for ripping the speech in half.\n\nThe claim originated from a tweet (archived here) where it was posted by Charlie Kirk on Twitter on February 4, 2020, hours after Trump's State of the Union address. It opened:\n\nUS Code prohibits the destruction of government records Nancy Pelosi may have just committed a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2071, Section 2071 (a) when she ripped up President Trump's State of the Union address This violation is punishable by up to three years in prison\n\nUsers on social media saw this:\n\nCharlie Kirk is the founder of Turning Point USA, a conservative group, and chairman of Students for Trump. The claim he put out on social media was soon spread by others.\n\nHigbie's followers on Twitter saw this:\n\nDonald Trump Jr. chimed in, and this is what his followers saw:\n\nAnd Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, told Fox News' Laura Ingraham that he would be filing ethics charges agaist Pelosi for ripping up her copy of the speech as Trump finished. On social media, he shared a copy of his letter to the House Committee on Ethics.\n\nThis is what Gaetz's followers saw:\n\nThe statue referenced by those promoting this claim reads as follows:\n\n(a)Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b)Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\n\nThe papers Pelosi had in hand were never \"filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States.\" So, this federal statute has no bearing on what she did to the copy when she tore it in half, according to legal experts. What she ripped up was a copy of Trump's speech, not an official government record, the sort that would be filed in the National Archives - and the sort that this statute exists to protect.\n\nSome legal experts weighed in with Politifact, which included the following:\n\n'Her copy of the State of the Union address is not a government record or government property at all,' said Douglas Cox, professor of law at the City of New York University School of Law and an expert in the laws governing the preservation of government records. 'It is personal property.' Under House rules, members of Congress are encouraged to preserve records or donate them to a research institution for historical study, Cox said. Unlike congressional committees, members are not legally required to hold onto their office's files. 'They can keep them private, they can destroy them, or they can rip them up,' he said. This is in contrast to presidential records, which have been considered government property since the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and are supposed to be stored with the National Archives for safekeeping. 'The State of the Union is a presidential record, which must go to the National Archives under the Presidential Records Act,' Nourse said '(Pelosi) did not mutilate the record that is filed with the Archives.'\n\nWe wrote about twitter.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Vitamin C Does NOT Slow Or Stop Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Bernie Sanders Is NOT Seeking Medical Release From Life Sentence In Prison\n\u2022 Fake News: Video From China Does NOT Show People Trying To Escape Coronavirus Quarantine\n\u2022 Fact check: Eight Iowa Counties Do NOT Have Total Registration Rates Larger Than Eligible Voter Population - NO 18,600 Extra Names on Voter Rolls", "lang": "en"}
