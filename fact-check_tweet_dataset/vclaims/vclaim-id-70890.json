The ruling remains the same.\n\nIn the debate over whether marijuana should be legalized, one issue is the question of potency. Critics of legalization argue that the street drug now available for sale is not the marijuana that a lot of baby boomers and Generation Xers have used.\n\nOne of them, Heidi Heilman, director of New England field development for and president of the , raised the issue March 13 in in The Providence Journal.\n\n\"Today\u2019s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear,\" she wrote. \"Such dangerous levels of THC heighten mental illness and addiction risks for those who smoke marijuana \u2014 especially for kids with developing brains.\"\n\nTHC or tetrahydrocannabinol, available by prescription, is the key active ingredient in marijuana.\n\nIt's well established that the potency of marijuana has increased over time. On Jan. 24, that when former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy said that marijuana today is \"genetically modified,\" with THC levels that \"far surpass the marijuana\" of the 1970s, his statement was Mostly True.\n\nHeilman was being more specific. Because something 100 percent more potent is actually twice as potent, she was saying that the potency of today's marijuana is now four to nine times greater than \"yesteryear,\" a rather vague starting point. Nonetheless, we wanted to see if her statement was on target or her statistic was a bit high.\n\nHeilman was quick to send us several pieces of information.\n\nThe first was showing a rapid increase in potency from 1960 to 2011, a 52-year span. It shows the ratio of THC in marijuana going from 0.2 percent to 11.4 percent. That's an increase of 5,700 percent, well outside the range cited by Heilman.\n\nBut are those numbers reliable?\n\nThe graph says the information came from a study in the Journal of Forensic Science . But that study was published in 2010, and only covered a 16-year period that ends in 2008.\n\nIts authors, researchers at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, examined 46,000 samples of marijuana seized during law enforcement raids. They found that the THC concentrations of marijuana had risen by about 171 percent in that time period, well below the 300 to 800 percent increase cited by Heilman.\n\nWe also contacted the Drug Enforcement Administration in Boston and Washington and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. They referred us back to the research center at Ole Miss, which has been monitoring THC content at least since the early 1970s.\n\nThe researchers there sent us copies of their reports, all published in the journal, along with test results that included the most recent data. We also secured some of their quarterly reports.\n\nWe found that even though the report Heilman cited didn\u2019t back up her claim, the Ole Miss data did.\n\nIn 2012, the most recent year in which testing has been completed, the average THC concentration was 12.3 percent.\n\nThat would be 300 percent higher (or four times stronger) than 1992 levels, when the average was 3.08 percent. And it would be 800 percent higher (or nine times stronger) than the average level of 0.98 percent found in 1976.\n\nHow high could the THC content potentially go?\n\nOne specimen, seized on Sept. 11, 2007, was found to have a THC content of 37.2 percent.\n\nHeidi Heilman said, \"Today\u2019s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear.\"\n\nLong-term testing shows that, on average, today's marijuana is three times more potent than pre-1993 marijuana and eight times more potent than grass seized in 1976 and earlier.\n\nWe rate her claim as .", "lang": "en"}
