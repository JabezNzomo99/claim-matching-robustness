The original image almost certainly comes from the funeral of IRA member Tony Catney. The image of Mr Corbyn, which has been edited in, comes from a separate picture of him wearing a blue t-shirt. The text on the t-shirt has also been changed.\n\nThe image has been circulating online for a number of years and has been the subject of scrutiny throughout.", "lang": "en"}
