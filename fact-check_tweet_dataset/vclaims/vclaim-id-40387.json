While not directly denying the accusations against Russia, he implied they were the product of a \u201cWestern anti-Russian\u201d conspiracy.\n\n\u201cThere are those who want to put Russia in the position of being on the defensive, in the position of the accused,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cMoreover, the accused in everything and everywhere, whatever area of international life you take: conflicts, the economy, energy, gas pipelines, trade in military products -- everywhere Russia violates something or does something that is disadvantageous to one or several Western countries.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFrom their point of view, the more such decisions are made, the better, they think, for their anti-Russian line of argument.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first such comment by Russia\u2019s top diplomat, who said earlier this year that the \u201cAnglo-Saxon group of states\u201d had invented and imposed the anti-doping rules. Polygraph.info debunked that claim.\n\nLavrov\u2019s suggestion that an anti-Russian conspiracy was behind the recommendations by WADA\u2019s CRC is likewise false.\n\nAs the CRC document clearly states, Russia is receiving same treatment as any other nation under investigation for doping its athletes.\n\nIn order to avoid the sanctions, Russia needed to provide WADA\u2019s investigative team with authentic copies of the database of the Moscow laboratory that was at the center of the doping scandal. Instead, the CRC said, Russia forged the data -- falsifying, altering and deleting hundreds of files.\n\nIn response, WADA gave the Russian authorities yet another opportunity to rectify the situation, sending to Moscow a list of technical questions and giving them additional months to respond.\n\nInstead, Russia responded with \u201clies and propaganda,\u201d the newly-appointed CEO of RUSADA, Yury Ganus, said in October.\n\nCommenting on the latest WADA CRC recommendations, Ganus said \u201cyou can use political slogans as much as you like,\u201d but the \u201creality of the situation\u201d is that Russia\u2019s sports authorities \u201cdid not do what could have been done\u201d to explain the alterations to the database.\n\n\u201cThere are no legal grounds to dispute the non-compliance (decision),\u201d he said. \u201cI am speaking about this realistically and with understanding of the matter,\u201d Ganus said.\n\n\"There is minimal hope that WADA will make a different decision, but we are the most disgraced country in the history of world sports, and, apparently, the world sports community is disposed towards taking a hardline,\" said Vyacheslav Fetisov, a member of the State Duma (the lower chamber of Russia\u2019s parliament) who was a famous professional hockey player and coach.", "lang": "en"}
