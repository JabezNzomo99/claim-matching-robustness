This claim is false; the video shows a police incident in the Canadian city of Toronto.\n\nThe nine-second video was published here in a Facebook group with more than 5,200 members on April 13, 2020.\n\nIt has been shared more than 3,200 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cA video showing the double standard of US human rights\u201d.\n\nThe same video has also been viewed hundreds of thousands of times after being shared here, here and here on Twitter, and here and here on Weibo alongside a similar claim.\n\nA reverse image search of screenshots extracted from the video in the misleading posts found this report published by the Canadian television network Global News on April 12, 2020.

Officers located a man on scene wielding a knife who was subsequently arrested. The man and an officer were taken to hospital with injuries. The Special Investigations Unit was notified and have now invoked their mandate.\u201d\n\nThe location seen in the video corresponds with Google Street View imagery here.\n\nThe arrest was also reported by other local Canadian news outlets, including the television network CTV News here, and daily newspaper Toronto Star here.\n\nThe same video was also debunked by Hong Kong fact checker Kauyim Media here.", "lang": "en"}
