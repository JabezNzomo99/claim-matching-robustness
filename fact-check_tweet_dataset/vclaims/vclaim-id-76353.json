Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that \"of all the people on this stage, (Donald Trump) performs the worst against Hillary Clinton\" in head-to-head matchups for the general election.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich later added that he\u2019s the candidate best positioned to take on Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\"I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points,\" Kasich said. He was referring to the four Republicans on the debate stage -- himself, Rubio, Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nWas Kasich correct? We turned to the polling averages at RealClearPolitics.com, a popular aggregator of comprehensive polling data.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by noting that polling experts typically urge caution when comparing head-to-head matchups for the general election this early in the campaign cycle.\n\nThat said, we looked at the polling results a couple of different ways. One was the RealClearPolitics poll average, which averages the most recent polls. The other was the range of results since Feb. 1. Here\u2019s a table summarizing the results:\n\nWhat does this tell us? First, it confirms Kasich\u2019s assertion that he beats Clinton \"by more than anybody\" still in the race. The average of recent polls shows that Kasich\u2019s edge over Clinton is 7.4 points, which is larger than the leads over Clinton being posted by Rubio, Cruz or Trump. (In fact, on average, Trump actually loses to Clinton by 3.4 points.)\n\nThe one element of Kasich\u2019s statement that isn\u2019t entirely supported by the data is that he beats Clinton by 11 points. It\u2019s true that in his strongest recent poll, Kasich defeated Clinton by 11 points -- it was a USA Today-Suffolk poll taken between Feb. 11 and Feb. 15. But emphasizing that one poll is a bit of cherry picking.\n\nIt also tells us that Rubio was correct that Trump does the worst against Clinton, as he loses to her by an average 3.4 percentage points in recent polls.\n\nKasich said that in head-to-head polls for the general election, \"I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points.\"\n\nThe RealClearPolitics average of recent polls shows Kasich faring better against Clinton than Rubio, Cruz or Trump. But focusing on the 11-point margin in his best poll is a bit of cherry picking.\n\nThe statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
