It has reached no conclusions, as of Dec. 21.\n\nHowever, two stories gaining popularity on Facebook claim that a Muslim man has been arrested for causing the crash. Users of the social media site have flagged them as potentially false. They are.\n\nOne story, with the headline, \u201cBREAKING: FBI Identifies Muslim Terrorist Who Derailed Amtrak Train,\u201d appears on Reagan Was Right, a self-described fictional website. It claims that the FBI raided the man\u2019s Delaware home and found \u201cBomb making materials as well as a \u2018cache of weapons\u2019 and instructions on making improvised explosive devices.\u201d\n\nBut, the FBI conducted no such raid and has made no arrests related to the crash, said David Fitz, spokesman for the FBI\u2019s Baltimore field office, which covers the state of Delaware.\n\nThe story claims that the man put a Sacajawea coin on the tracks to derail the train and refers to a fictional professor to lend authority to the idea that that could work. It refers to \u201cHarvard physics professor, Dr. James Wright,\u201d but there is nobody by that name on the physics faculty at Harvard University. Also, it is extremely unlikely that a coin could derail a train.\n\nThe story also says the name of the man arrested is \u201cMuhammad Christopher Blair.\u201d Christopher Blair is the name of the person who runs a network of so-called satirical websites, including Reagan Was Right. The photo that ran with the story also appears to show Blair, himself.\n\nThe other story, which originated from another of Blair\u2019s sites called No Fake News Online, has a headline that says: \u201cUPDATE: Derailed Amtrak Train Was No Accident After All, Muslim Man Arrested.\u201d\n\nThat story has an unrelated picture of Shaker Aamer, who spent more than 13 years in the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay without being charged, next to a picture of the Washington train crash. It also repeats the false claim that a Sacajawea coin on the track caused the crash.\n\nIt also makes up quotes that it attributes to the conservative new site, Breitbart.\n\nBoth stories were picked up and posted by other websites that don\u2019t have a satire disclaimer.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nTollefson, Rodika et al. \u201cAmtrak train hurtles off Washington state overpass, killing 3 people and injuring about 100.\u201d Washington Post. 18 Dec 2017.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: FBI Identifies Muslim Terrorist Who Derailed Amtrak Train.\u201d Reagan Was Right. 19 Dec 2017.\n\n\u201cUPDATE: Derailed Amtrak Train Was No Accident After All, Muslim Man Arrested.\u201d NoFakeNews.Online. 18 Dec 2017.\n\nRose, David. \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Guantanamo Briton Shaker Aamer relives his 14-yearnightmare of savage abuse \u2013 including agony of being \u2018hog-tied\u2019 for 45 minutes at a time \u2013 and the joy of finally seeing his family again.\u201d Daily Mail. 17 Dec 2015.", "lang": "en"}
