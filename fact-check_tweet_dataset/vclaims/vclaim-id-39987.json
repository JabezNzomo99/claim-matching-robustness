But he falsely suggests none could be fired before a 2017 law.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-09-17T07:00:15.850Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-39987", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/17/president-trumps-claims-about-va-firings/", "vclaim": "In Trump\u2019s telling, such as in his recent remarks to House Republicans, before the law there was no way for the agency to fire underperforming workers. That\u2019s simply wrong. Government records show that hundreds of Veterans Affairs employees were fired every month before the law was enacted. In 2014, Congress passed a law that was said to make it easier to remove senior officials because of poor performance or misconduct.\n\nThe publicly available data is limited and somewhat contradictory. We dug into a database called \u201cFedScope\u201d maintained by the Office of Personnel Management (warning: it really only works with Firefox), but the Veterans Affairs data goes only through the end of June 2018. So that gives us just one year of data after passage of the act. (We searched for terminations or removal for discipline/performance of permanent workers.)\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs used to post monthly and annual reports on actions taken under the law, but those were removed this year as the result of a grievance filed by the American Federation of Government Employees. The union argued that too much personal data was released, making it easy to identify who was fired. (We did find the 2017 annual report still floating around on the Web but will not include a link to it.)\n\nAccording to our parsing of the OPM data, there was an uptick in firings after the law was enacted. In the 12 months before the law, 2,619 VA employees were fired, compared with 3,473 in the 12 months after the law. At a pace of 290 employees a month, in theory that would get you to 7,600 by the end of August.\n\nThat would suggest an additional 7,000 people were fired since May 31, 2018, or almost 500 people a month. She said the number was calculated via HR*SMART, the official record for VA human resources transactions. It\u2019s unclear if this data set is comparable to the report to Congress or what we found via OPM\u2019s FedScope database.\n\nThe VA Accountability Act was supposed to make it easier to fire higher-level officials, but it also shortened the removal process for all employees. In the 12 months after enactment, only three people in the senior executive service were terminated, according to our count. (The report to Congress also says only three members of the senior executive service were fired.)\n\nThe 2017 annual report suggests that many of those fired were in relatively low-level positions. We counted 227 housekeeping aides, 166 nursing assistants and 114 food service workers who were removed, demoted or suspended more than 14 days, as well as 22 laundry workers and nine cemetery caretakers. We identified 90 people with \u201csupervisor\u201d or \u201csupervisory\u201d in their title, though many were demoted or suspended, not fired.\n\nJ. David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in 2018 congressional testimony that less than 1 percent of those fired were supervisors. \u201cHousekeeping aides were the largest number fired, followed by nursing assistants, registered nurses, food service workers and medical support assistants,\u201d he said. \u201cIn contrast, supervisors (across the entire Department) ranked in 19th place.\u201d As he put it, \u201cExtremely few managers were being held accountable under a law that was justified largely as a management accountability tool.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that many of those targeted for firing were disabled veterans, because many of the affected positions, such as housekeeping aides or cemetery caretakers, are historically set aside for disabled veterans. \u201cA disabled veteran with a chronic condition requested a reasonable accommodation for telework to accommodate his condition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe accommodation would have obviated the alleged conduct. The Agency never responded to his request, then issued a proposed removal.\u201d\n\nDepending on how you do the math, it might be possible to tally the termination of 7,600 VA employees. VA says that Trump is actually lowballing the figure and it\u2019s really more than 8,600. That\u2019s a huge jump from the available public data.\n\nThe biggest problem with these numbers is that Trump ignores the fact that hundreds of VA employees every month already were being fired before the law was passed; in fact, he falsely suggests that firings were not possible before, even if employees \u201cstole or were sadists.\u201d On top of that, the available data suggests the law is mainly being used to target low-level employees, not necessarily senior officials said to avoid accountability.", "lang": "en"}
