(Swatantra Dev Singh has accused the National President, Akhilesh Yadav- These people used to live a luxurious life and had spent a 100 crores rupees in Ac and tiles of the bungalow which they took away. You see Mr. Rajnath Singh\u2019s Bungalow. After all, why doesn\u2019t the media show it? How it has been turned into ruins! -translated)tweeted Preeti Chobey, National Secretary of Samajwadi Party. The photographs attached are allegedly of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh\u2019s house in UP, which he has vacated after a notice from the estate department based on a Supreme Court order asking all the former CMs to vacate their government bungalows allocated to them.\n\nSwatantra Dev Singh, Minister of State with Independent Charge for Transport & Protocol had demanded a probe against the Former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for having illegally taken the Government owned properties of the bungalow. In response, Akhilesh Yadav had held a press conference in which he sarcastically offered two taps back to the government.\n\nMoreover, the same post from a Samajwadi party leaning Facebook page Jai Jai Akhilesh- AZMI(@lucknowsp) has been shared more than 6400 times and \u2018liked\u2019 more than 3400 times. It has also been shared more than 6200 times from a Facebook account Amit K. Yadav Saifai.\n\nThe photographs of the ruined bungalow have their own distinct watermark which gives a clue of their source. The text of the watermark says \u2018123RF\u2019. Alt News did a Google Image Search for each image to verify its original source. Here are the results:\n\u2022 This is from Shutterstock, an American stock photography website. This image was clicked by a Polish photographer named Mariusz Niedzwiedzki, titled \u2018Interior of a ruined house\u2019.\n\n2. This photograph is from Dreamstime, another stock photo website. This image was taken on 23rd October 2012 by a photographer, Alexandre Zveiger, titled \u2018Old kitchen destroyed, interior abandoned house\u2019.\n\n3. This image has a familiar news agency\u2019s watermark. So, Alt News did a search on the official Reuters photo gallery with the words \u2018ruined house\u2019, and found that it is an image of a house which was damaged during a fight in the town of Debaltseve in Ukraine on February 25, 2015. The photo was clicked by Baz Ratner.\n\n4. \u2018Long corridor of old destroyed house, interior\u2019 was also clicked by photographer Alexandre Zveiger for another stock content agency, 123RF.\n\nAll of the above photographs are unrelated and anachronistic. It takes only a glance to see the images have a watermark of different organizations and thus raise suspicion of their genuineness.", "lang": "en"}
