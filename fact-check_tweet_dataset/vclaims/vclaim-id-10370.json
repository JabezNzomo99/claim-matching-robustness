The Comelec even supposedly answered: \"Are you sure there were INC (members) there?\"\n\nComelec spokesperson James Jimenez told VERA Files the claims are untrue. \"There was no such exchange. The statement that's attributed to the Comelec was never made by any Comelec social media operator,\" he said.\n\nThe screen grabs also appear to have been photoshopped.\n\nElection results from the ABS-CBN election page show Marcos got 5,425 votes in Lamitan City, while 20,382 votes went to then candidate and now Vice President Leni Robredo.\n\nThe January story was reposted by several social media pages on April 6, the week the vote recount for the vice presidential post began. Marcos filed an election protest in June 2016 contesting Robredo's win.\n\nThe biggest traffic generators on social media: Duterte Kami, Unite Pinas and Marcos Loyalist.\n\nEditor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.", "lang": "en"}
