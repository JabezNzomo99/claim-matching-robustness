The claim is false; the video actually shows firefighters staging an exercise in Sichuan, China, in 2015.\n\nThe video has been shared repeatedly online, for example in this Facebook post on February 23, 2017, where it has been viewed more than 8,300 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same video has been shared on Facebook with a similar claim here, here and here, on YouTube here and here, and on Twitter here.\n\nThe misleading posts were all uploaded the same day that a fire broke out at 23 Tuas View Circuit in Singapore on February 23, 2017, according to this post on the official Facebook page of the Singapore Civil Defence Force.\n\nBut the claim is false; the video shared in the misleading posts actually shows firefighters staging an exercise in Sichuan, China, in 2015.\n\nA reverse image search on Google using keyframes from the video found that the misleading clip has been edited from footage that has circulated online since 2015.\n\nIt was published here on YouTube on November 17, 2015.\n\nAFP located photos of the same fire in this post published by the official Sichuan Public Security Fire Brigade on Chinese social media platform Weibo on November 13, 2015.\n\nThe Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201c[Here comes the blockbuster! Fire rescue drill for emergency relief department leaders from member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization]. A rescue drill display was held at the Chengdu Public Security Fire Brigade Training Base on the afternoon of November 12th for the eighth meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization\u2019s emergency relief department.
