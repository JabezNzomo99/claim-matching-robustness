The information focuses on Yevgeny Prigozhin, and updates the section below detailing the Putin ally\u2019s involvement.\n\nThe Wagner Group, allegedly a \u201cprivate military company,\u201d attracted worldwide attention after some of its personnel in Syria were killed and wounded in a devastating air and artillery strike by the U.S. military targeting pro-Syrian government militia forces on February 7.\n\nMercenary forces are illegal in Russia, yet there is evidence the government established and supported Wagner\u2019s early growth, operations in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, and their operations in Syria.\n\nEstimates of the number of Russian citizens killed in the February 7 incident ranges from \"five,\" to more than 200, according to Wagner personnel.\n\nThe Conflict Intelligence Team, an NGO that investigates reports of military activity in Ukraine and Syria, has confirmed the deaths of ten \u201ccontractors\u201d -- nine Russians and one Ukrainian.\n\nRussian officials from the Kremlin, Foreign Ministry, and Defense Ministry initially denied or downplayed the number of Russian victims. Statements have been contradictory, at times accusing the press of spreading \u201cdisinformation\u201d and other times admitting higher casualty figures while still denying any knowledge of the Russian citizens\u2019 activities in Syria.\n\n\u200bThis week, (February 21) the Russian Foreign Ministry admitted there were \u201cdead citizens of Russia and the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries\u201d and \"several dozen\" wounded in the clash.\n\n\u201cOur guys were going to commandeer an oil refinery and the Yankees were holding it,\u201d said a paramilitary fighter in an audio recording obtained by Polyraph.info from a source close to the Kremlin and published February 16.\n\n\u201cSo they tore us to pieces for sure, put us through hell, and the Yankees knew for sure that the Russians were coming,\u201d the unidentified soldier said.\n\nIn recent days, some Russian state media started acknowledging higher Russian casualty figures even while reporting on official denials. In reporting, earlier, that \u201cdozens\u201d of \u201cRussian and CIS citizens\u201d had been killed in the attack, RT quoted the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying:\n\n\u201cThere are Russian citizens in Syria, who went there on their own will and for various purposes. It\u2019s not up to the Foreign Ministry to judge the legality of the decisions taken by those people.\u201d\n\nThe same article noted: \u201cMoscow denies any direct involvement with such paramilitary troops and insists that they act as private citizens. Being a mercenary or organizing a mercenary force is a crime in Russia, although in practice only a handful of people have been prosecuted for it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, despite overwhelming evidence that Russian citizens crossed international borders to wage wars to advance Russian state interests in such places as Ukraine, very few have been prosecuted for mercenary activities. On the contrary, some have been lauded as heroes by the state media specifically for their mercenary service. One Russian video on Youtube calls Wagner \"our heroes.\"\n\nA pair of individuals who were arrested for mercenary activities, however, has an interesting connection to the Wagner Group, and its story may shed some light on the role of the Russian security services in organizing this \u201cprivate military company.\u201d\n\nIn the spring of 2013, a Hong Kong-registered \u201cprivate military company\u201d called \u201cSlavonic Corps\u201d went to Syria to conduct combat missions on behalf of the Assad government. The organization recruited mostly on Russian Web sites and sought to attract former members of elite Russian military units in the airborne forces, naval infantry, and special forces (spetsnaz). Officially, the Slavonic Corps had been \u201chired\u201d by another Russian Hong Kong-based firm known as the Moran Security Group. Moran Security Group is a security company, specializing mainly in anti-piracy and security for high-value sites. While private security companies are legal under Russian law, private military companies are not.\n\nThe story of Wagner begins with the Slavonic Corps and its failed mission in Syria. In fact, \u201cWagner\u201d was the code name of one of the group\u2019s contractors, Dmitry Utkin, a Russian former special forces officer. When Wagner and his comrades returned to Russia, two of the \u201ccompany\u2019s\u201d executives were arrested by the Federal Security Services (FSB), charged with mercenary activity and sentenced to jail terms.\n\n\n\nUtkin and his new \u201cPMC\u201d (Private Military Company) Wagner would again appear in 2014, during Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, where the unit fought against Ukrainian government forces in the Donbas region. Hacked emails reveal that the FSB was closely involved in recruitment operations for this supposedly \u201cprivate\u201d outfit. But subsequent investigations by the Russian independent news outlet Fontanka revealed far more connections between Wagner and the state.\n\nFirst, Wagner was allowed to use a military facility as its training base. The facility, located in Molkino in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region, is also home to the 10th Special Forces Brigade of the GRU (military intelligence).\n\nThe Russian news agency RBC talked to a former mercenary who spoke about his experiences with the outfit during its first deployment to Syria in 2016. According to him, the company was well supplied. Ammunition was plentiful, and the unit, organized as a \u201cbattalion tactical group\u201d with an estimated total strength of over 2,000 men, was equipped with modern T-72 tanks, D-30 122mm howitzers, and BM-21 \u201cGrad\u201d multiple rocket launchers. Pay was high and always on time.\n\nIn addition to the generous supply of money and equipment, as well as the right to use a Russian military base, members of Wagner also received state medals typically awarded to members of the Russian armed forces. These individuals received state medals despite the fact that their activities appear to be illegal and Russian authorities, from the Kremlin to the Defense Ministry, have routinely denied knowledge about this group\u2019s operations in Syria.\n\n\u200bIn addition, some sources claim Wagner troops have been transported to and from Syria on Russian military transport aircraft, and that its food and other essential supplies come from the Russian Defense Ministry. Fighters wounded in the February 7 attack have been found in Russian military hospitals in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nAll this would seem to cast doubt on the initial claims of the Kremlin, Foreign Ministry, and Defense Ministry that they know next to nothing about the Wagner Group and the fate of its personnel in Syria. It is possible that the outfit lost some of its state support in 2017. This is based on claims that during the group\u2019s second deployment to Syria that same year, soldiers suddenly experienced unexplained pay cuts and salary arrears. There were also complaints about severe shortages of ammunition and that, in contrast to the modern equipment they received for their 2016 deployment, in 2017 they were furnished with out-of-date weapons.\n\nThis theory is also supported by reports of Evgeny Prigozhin\u2019s involvement. He is the owner of a number of businesses that are linked to the Kremlin and a close associate of Vladimir Putin. The Washington Post reported February 22 that U.S. intelligence had intercepted communications between Prigozhin and a Syrian official, in which he claimed to have received permission from an unnamed Russian government minister to move forward with a \u201cfast and strong\u201d initiative which would take place between February 6-9. Prigozhin reportedly told the Syrian official that his initiative would be a \u201cgood surprise\u201d for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Post report said \u201cU.S. intelligence believes that Prigozhin also \u2018almost certainly\u2019 controls Russian mercenaries fighting in Syria,\u201d specifically Wagner.\n\n\n\n Prigozhin is also linked to a company called Evro-Polis, which opened an office in Damascus in 2017. According to AP and Fontanka, Evro-Polis signed a deal with Syria\u2019s state-owned oil company whereby it would receive 25% of any oil and gas revenues produced at facilities it recaptured from the Islamic State or rebel forces. Fontanka\u2019s report on Wagner found that it was cooperating with Evro-Polis in 2017. Survivors of the February 7 battle claimed their mission was to take control of an oil refinery. Prigozhin is also the owner of the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, better known as the \u201ctroll factory.\u201d He was sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2016 over his business activities in Ukraine and recently he was indicted by the FBI for alleged involvement in election interference in 2016.\n\nMark Galeotti, a researcher with the Institute of International Relations in Prague, has written extensively on the topic of Wagner and Russia\u2019s use of mercenaries as a potentially deniable asset. According to him, Wagner cannot be considered a legitimate private military company.\n\n\u201cI tend to call Wagner a pseudo-mercenary outfit because it is somewhere in between,\u201d Galeotti told Polygraph.info. \u201cGiven that it seems largely bankrolled through Evro Polis [a company owned by Prigozhin], and it has a contract with the Syrian government worth 25% of the output of any gas and oil fields it recovers, there is clearly some truly mercenary aspect, even if much of the time it is working for the Russian command cell in Damascus.\u201d\n\nBut while he acknowledges a possible change in Wagner\u2019s ownership, Galeotti agreed that the organization was undoubtedly tied to the Russian state, at least in the beginning: \u201cI don't think there is any question they were originally a state-sponsored op, is there?\u201d\n\nAnd given the fact that wounded fighters still appear to be receiving treatment at Russian military hospitals, possibly arriving on Russian military transport aircraft, it appears that Russian authorities know far more about Wagner and its activities than they have so far admitted in public.", "lang": "en"}
