It said Kelley was \"an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by \u2018targeting white conservative churches\u2019 and causing anarchy in the United States.\"\n\nThe post also said he \"was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers \u2018this is a communist revolution\u2019 before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times.\"\n\nNone of those details have been confirmed by law enforcement agencies, or reported by reputable media outlets. Authorities said their initial investigation showed the attack was likely motivated by a family dispute, and not a broader movement.\n\nThe story was an incomplete copy of a longer post on fake news website YourNewsWire.com, which attributed many of its assertions to Kelley\u2019s alleged Facebook profile.\n\n\"Devin Kelley\u2019s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included \u2018Civil and social rights\u2019 and \u2018Civil rights\u2019 as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons,\" the post read.\n\nYourNewsWire.com claimed that they had Facebook images of Kelley and an AR-15-style rifle, although there was no indication it was the Ruger AR-556 rifle police have reported finding at the scene.\n\nWe could not find a Facebook profile for Kelley, so we could not independently verify the content of his alleged profile. The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, among others, reported that the profile with those photos had been taken down shortly after the shooting.\n\nThe top of the YourNewsWire.com story contained the two images, plus a third of an Antifa flag. Antifa United debunked the use of the flag image in a Facebook post.\n\n\"Let's go ahead and lay this to rest right now. The far-right (badly) put together a collage of images/mock up of a FB profile and are claiming the Texas shooter uploaded a picture of his antifa flag. How do we know its fake?\" the group posted on Nov. 5. \"That's OUR picture. Pulled from our shop website when we had that flag design in stock. The person holding it in the picture is me. The admin of this page. In my office. You can only see a part of my torso but yeah\u2026\"\n\nFor the record, the only official image of Kelley released by authorities was his drivers license photo.\n\nThe YourNewsWire.com post also contained an image that purported to show two individuals having a text conversation about the shooting, with one of them saying they had \"talked to some people who were inside.\"\n\nThere was no attribution for the conversation, which contained some of the bogus details YourNewsWire.com was reporting \u2014 including the Antifa flag, the number of shooters and a reference to Das Kapital, a Karl Marx book criticizing capitalism.\n\nWe attempted to contact Baxter Dmitry, who is listed as the author on the post, to confirm the sources of these details, but did not get a reply.\n\nThe idea that Kelley was an antifa member targeting conservatives was a popular talking point among the so-called alt-right following the shooting. Other conservative outlets focused on Kelley\u2019s supposed atheism and Facebook \"like\" of CNN.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety confirmed on Nov. 6 that it appeared Kelley\u2019s attack was related to a family dispute.\n\n\"This was not racially motivated, it wasn\u2019t over religious beliefs,\" agency spokesman Freeman Martin said in a news conference. \"There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws.\"\n\nCNN reported that Kelley killed his wife\u2019s grandmother, Lula White, in the attack. NBC reported he may have been targeting his mother-in-law.\n\n\"The suspect\u2019s mother-in-law attended this church,\" Freeman said. \"We know that \u2026 she had received threatening texts from him.\"\n\nHe declined to elaborate, saying the investigation was ongoing.\n\nA fake news post said Kelley was Antifa and wanted to start a \"communist revolution.\"\n\nThe story originally came from YourNewsWire.com, a website we know to post articles full of bogus details. Law enforcement has not reported the sensational particulars in the site\u2019s story. A spokesman attributed the massacre to a domestic dispute among Kelley and his family members, not connecting Kelley to Antifa or communism.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
