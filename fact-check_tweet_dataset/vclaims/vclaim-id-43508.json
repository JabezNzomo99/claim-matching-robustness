Jeff Merkley released a document that he said shows nearly $10 million that could have been used for hurricane recovery efforts was recently diverted from the Federal Emergency Management Agency \u2014 which oversees federal response to hurricane disasters \u2014 to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both agencies, responded, \u201cUnder no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from [FEMA] to immigration enforcement efforts.\u201d\n\nDHS said the money taken from FEMA came from its Operations and Support account and represented savings from \u201cmanagement expenses that came in under budget.\u201d According to DHS budget documents, though, the O&S account can also be used for recovery and response efforts. In any case, all told, the $10 million is minuscule compared with FEMA\u2019s $26.5 billion Disaster Relief Fund.\n\nWe\u2019ll sift through the conflicting statements and present the facts.\n\nMerkley, a Democrat from Oregon, first shared the document \u2014 DHS\u2019 Transfer and Reprogramming Notifications for FY 2018 \u2014 with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow. It shows (on page 29) that $9,755,303 was taken from FEMA accounts with labels such as \u201cResponse and Recovery\u201d and \u201cMission Support\u201d and transferred mostly to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for \u201cEnforcement and Removal Operations.\u201d Merkley told Maddow he found the transfer \u201cextraordinary\u201d as \u201cHurricane Florence [is] bearing down on the Carolinas.\u201d\n\nAccording to the 39-page document, without the additional funds, \u201cICE will not be able to fulfill its adult detention requirements in FY 2018. Insufficient funding could require ICE to release any new book-ins and illegal border violators. ICE will not be able to deport those who have violated immigration laws. ICE could also be forced to reduce its current interior enforcement operations, curtailing criminal alien and fugitive arrests-which would pose a significant risk to public safety and national security by permitting known offenders to remain at large.\u201d\n\nConversely, the report stated, the \u201cmission impact\u201d to FEMA \u201cis minimized as FEMA will curtail training, travel, public engagement sessions, IT security support and infrastructure maintenance, and IT investments.\u201d\n\nMerkley later released a statement saying, \u201cThis is a scandal. At the start of hurricane season \u2014 when American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still suffering from FEMA\u2019s inadequate recovery efforts \u2014 the administration transferred millions of dollars away from FEMA. And for what? To implement their profoundly misguided \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy. It wasn\u2019t enough to rip thousands of children out of the arms of their parents \u2014 the administration chose to partly pay for this horrific program by taking away from the ability to respond to damage from this year\u2019s upcoming and potentially devastating hurricane season.\u201d\n\nDHS pushed back on that claim, with DHS spokesman Tyler Q. Houlton tweeting that money was taken from FEMA\u2019s \u201croutine operating expenses\u201d not hurricane disaster response. \u201cUnder no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from [FEMA] to immigration enforcement efforts,\u201d Houlton tweeted.\n\nA DHS official told us the roughly $9.8 million was transferred from FEMA\u2019s Operations and Support account, which supports FEMA headquarters\u2019 operational expenses. The money was \u201cmanagement expenses that came in under budget,\u201d including for \u201cemployee travel expenses, training, basic purchase cards, office supplies, HQ overhead support.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was money that was in savings and was going to expire at the end of this fiscal year on September 30th,\u201d the official told us. And, the official said, \u201cOperational (O&S) account funding cannot be used for disaster response. \u2026 The mission-impact on FEMA response and recovery of this transfer of funds is zero.\u201d\n\nThere is a separate Disaster Relief Fund that showed a balance of $26.5 billion at the end of August. That fund can only be tapped when a president declares a major disaster, and it allows FEMA to \u201cdirect, coordinate, manage, and fund eligible response and recovery efforts associated with domestic major disasters and emergencies that overwhelm State resources.\u201d\n\nSo to put that in context, the DHS official said, the Disaster Relief Fund is 2,500 times larger than the amount diverted from the FEMA Operations account.\n\n\u201cNot to be too jaded, but my first thought was the $10 million figure would get people\u2019s attention but considering the likely scale and cost of Florence it represents a tiny fraction of the cost,\u201d Steve Ellis of the budget watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense told us via email. \u201cIt\u2019s also a small fraction of the [nearly $1 billion] O&S budget.\u201d\n\nEllis said it\u2019s also true that FEMA\u2019s Operations and Support funding is \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d and expires at the end of the fiscal year (though as a fiscal watchdog, Ellis said he\u2019d rather see the money going toward the federal deficit).\n\nNonetheless, Ellis said, it is \u201cdisingenuous at best\u201d for DHS to claim that the $10 million couldn\u2019t be used for disaster-related activities.\n\nEllis referred to FEMA\u2019s budget request for Operations and Support \u2014 the fund from which the $10 million was taken.\n\nSpecifically, the budget document says that O&S\u2019 Response and Recovery \u2014 from which more than $2 million was transferred \u2014 includes efforts to assist in the aftermath of disasters like hurricanes.\n\n\u201cAnyone who knows FEMA knows it\u2019s parsing words,\u201d Moira Whelan, a former chief of staff in the Office of Gulf Coast Rebuilding at DHS\u2019 National Joint Information Center under President Obama, told the Washington Post. According to the Post, \u201cThe disaster relief funding left untouched by the transfer covers post-storm assistance and the rebuilding of public structures, while \u2018Response and Recovery\u2019 money tapped for the transfer pays for plans, logistics, supply-chain management and after-action reports that seek to improve on previous seasons, said Whelan.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Merkley told us the transfer document \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Sen. Merkley has said, the bottom line is that FEMA is the agency that is most critical to hurricane response,\u201d the spokeswoman said via email, \u201cand that FEMA today has $10 million less in its coffers than it would have otherwise thanks to the actions of this administration.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
