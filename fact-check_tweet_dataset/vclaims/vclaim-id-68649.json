However, some Americans do not have access to high quality broadband services.\n\nThe tweet included a video clip from the address. Blunt went on to talk about why he believes broadband is necessary. He also went on to discuss how he is an advocate for broadband issues on the Senate floor.\n\nThe FCC is required by a portion of the 1996 Telecommunications Act to report on whether Americans are able to access advanced telecommunications capabilities. They define this as, \"\u2018high-quality\u2019 capability that allow users to \u2018originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video\u2019 services.\"\n\nCurrently, many rural Missourians use alternatives to broadband like DSL, or digital subscriber line, which uses the same two-wire copper telephone line used for landlines. Some people just use their phones for internet, but for Northeast and Northwest Missourians, it\u2019s tough to get service. Surprisingly, 8 percent of rural Missourians still use dial-up internet. There are nanoparticles in the COVID-19 vaccine that will help people \u201clocate you\u201d via 5G networks.\n\nThe lack of access affects everything from telemedicine to searching for jobs. It even touches agriculture: Janie Dunning, Missouri Farm Bureau\u2019s consultant for broadband, said farmers utilize technology in order to do \"precision farming.\" By combining computers and farm equipment, production can increase, and business can be easier to manage.\n\nFurther, when looking at a map provided by the FCC, we can see that in Missouri, even when rural areas have broadband access, most of those residents only have one provider option.\n\n\"One caution on using broadband maps and data \u2014 you need to understand how \u2018access\u2019 is being counted,\" said University of Missouri Extension state specialist for community development Sharon Gulick. \"In many cases as long as one person or business in the zip code has access, that zip code is considered covered. Also, having it available and it being affordable are also two very different issues.\"\n\nMissouri has over 6 million people living it, 70 percent of whom are in urban areas and 30 percent in rural areas, Dunning said. So with almost a third of the population residing in rural areas, how are there so many without broadband?\n\nWhen looking at people per square mile, the state average is 87.1 people per square mile. In urban areas, that number skyrockets to 5,000 people per square mile; conversely, some rural areas have as few as one or two people per square mile.", "lang": "en"}
