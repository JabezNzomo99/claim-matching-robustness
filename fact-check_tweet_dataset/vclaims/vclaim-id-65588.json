These claims are false, according to Toronto Public Health, Ontario\u2019s Health Ministry and the Catholic and Greek Orthodox Archdioceses of Toronto.\n\nOne post has been shared by multiple accounts since July 8, 2020. Versions of the post link to different articles (here, here) and a July 5 YouTube video of a priest in the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas in Toronto. In it, he claimed that the City of Toronto \u201cforbade the holy communion\u201d and said that \u201cit looks like the persecution of the church\u201d continues.\n\nThe claims were also shared in Russia and the United States.\n\nThis link was also shared in a now-unavailable tweet by Fox News host Laura Ingraham.\n\nThese claims are false and both the Greek Orthodox and Catholic Archdioceses of Toronto have worked with health authorities to ensure communion could continue safely.\n\nIn March, places of worship in Toronto were instructed by the Province of Ontario to close in response to the coronavirus pandemic which saw 15,377 confirmed cases and 1,150 deaths in the city.\n\nThey were allowed to reopen at 30 percent capacity when the city entered stage 2 of reopening on June 24.\n\nThe advice issued by the province on June 15 and by the city on July 8 said places of worship should \u201csuspend activities that increase risk of disease transmission,\u201d ranging from sharing books to prayer mats and communion materials.\n\nHoly communion was not banned and was not singled out from other faith practices in the public health suspension.\n\n\u201cFor the period between June 12 to July 3, 2020, the churches dispersed Holy Communion normally until one or more persons... complained to the government authorities in Canada that the Greek Orthodox Churches are giving Holy Communion with a common spoon,\u201d Archbishop Sotirios of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese said in a press release shared with AFP.\n\nArchbishop Sotirios said he contacted government officials to discuss a protocol for communion in accordance with public health advice. This \u201cwas accepted by government authorities in Canada and on Sunday, July 12, 2020, the priests in our churches gave Holy Communion with a separate spoon for each believer,\u201d he said,\n\n\u201cIt is noted here that all Christian churches, as well as places of worship of all other religions, have received and continue to receive the same treatment on behalf of government authorities.\u201d added Archbishop Sotirios.\n\nThe same is true of Catholic churches in Toronto.\n\n\u201cChurches in the Archdiocese of Toronto re-opened for public worship in mid-June. We have distributed Holy Communion in the hand only [as opposed to directly in the mouth] during this time of pandemic,\u201d Neil MacCarthy, Director of Communications for the Archdiocese of Toronto, told AFP by email. The Catholic archdiocese also set out a protocol which was approved by health authorities, as explained in this tweet.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford announced that, as of July 31, 2020, Toronto would progress to Stage 3 of reopening with churches and other religious facilities continuing to operate at 30 percent capacity.", "lang": "en"}
