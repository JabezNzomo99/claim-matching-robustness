He denied being the author in a July 10 tweet.\n\nRamsey, a New York Times bestselling author, provides financial advice to listeners on his nationally syndicated radio program \u201cThe Dave Ramsey Show.\u201d He was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 2015, according to the Radio Hall of Fame\u2019s website.\n\nFacebook users recently attributed to Ramsey a long statement that advocates against a \u201ccashless society.\u201d It lists many alleged implications of such a society, including \u201cno more money in #birthdaycards,\u201d \u201cno more #charitycollections\u201d and \u201cno more cash for a #rainydayfund or for that something special you have been putting $20 a week away for.\u201d\n\n\u201cA cashless society means no cash,\u201d reads the beginning of the long statement. \u201cZero. It doesn\u2019t mean mostly cashless and you can still use a \u2018wee bit of cash here & there.\u2019 Cashless means fully #digital, fully #traceable, fully #controlled. I think those who support a cashless society aren\u2019t fully aware of what they are asking for.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence Ramsey produced the statement. A search of his social media pages didn\u2019t turn up anything matching the text in the Facebook post. It also doesn\u2019t appear in his books or on his website, where many editions of his \u201cDave Says\u201d column can be read.\n\nFurther adding to the attribution\u2019s dubiousness, the long statement appears to have first started circulating on Facebook without being credited to Ramsey. Data from CrowdTangle shows instances of the statement being shared without Ramsey\u2019s name attached in early July.\n\nRamsey tweeted on July 10 that the author of the long statement was \u201cNOT me,\u201d appearing to satirically attribute the words \u201cEverything on the internet is true\u201d to former President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nIn the past, the radio host has commented on businesses not accepting cash payments.

But in most cases I don\u2019t think anything about it. I\u2019ll just use my debit card, and buy what I need.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
