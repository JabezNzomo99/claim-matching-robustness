A reader\u2019s daughter received this letter in the mail; in fact, many students in the girl\u2019s school received similar letters. Perhaps mindful of John Oliver\u2019s takedown of the Miss America contest, the reader asked us to vet the numbers in the solicitation. (Note that the letter above has \u201ccollege scholarships\u201d in boldface type.) So we decided to investigate and are presenting the results as a reader service for families considering participation in National American Miss contests.\n\nThe National American Miss is a pageant contest for girls in either five different age groups (at the state level) or six (at the national level), ranging from as young as age 4 to as old as 20. The organization bills itself as less of a \u201cbeauty pageant\u201d and more as a way to help girls build confidence and communication skills. About 60 percent of the scoring is based on communications skills rather than appearance. For participants under the age of 12, there is a \u201cno make-up\u201d rule. (Here are some videos of recent competitions.)\n\nMayes provided extensive documentation of the prizes awarded at the state and national level, including a full breakdown of the checks given at the last national contest (with names of recipients obscured). He asserted that the numbers actually showed that awards totaled $47,580 (rather than $25,000) for the state contests and $623,035 (rather than $500,000) for the national contest.\n\nBut those numbers include the cost of the crowns, banners and other paraphernalia given to winners, which for the national contest total nearly $28,000. There\u2019s also nearly $50,000 allotted for $22 trophies given to participants. Winners of the state pageants earn a waiver of $795 participation fee, so that\u2019s another $100,000. And there is nearly $78,000 devoted to complimentary hotel stays, more than $50,000 for complimentary Disneyland tickets, as well as $21,000 for flowers.\n\nThe actual cash awards are listed as totaling $76,480, while there is another $15,000 for $1,000 scholarship checks. (Twelve of these checks are for modeling courses.) There are also six $325 scholarship checks. So the cash and scholarship portion of the prize pool totals less than $100,000. (Mayes noted that the year before, the organization ended up giving out more than $90,000 in checks, which he said \u201cis a reflection of our policy that we are always certain to award more than we publish.\u201d)\n\n\u201cAs a practical solution, we provide all cash awards and scholarships as checks, written in full at the time of the event, to the recipient with an admonishment to use the funds for their education,\u201d he said. \u201cThe checks are handed to the parent in person and signed for at the time of receipt.\u201d Thus the only specific scholarship award is for a modeling course.\n\nIn last year\u2019s competition, the records provided by Mayes show the six top winners in the \u201cNational America Miss\u201d category received a $5,000 check. (These are competitors who were state title winners, and thus had their entry fee waived.) The next biggest check was for $2,000, for the six winners of the \u201cAll-America Miss.\u201d (These competitors qualified in the state pageant, but were required to pay the $795 entry fee.) Then there were checks for $1,000 or $800 for winners of individual talent contests. The most a runner-up can win is $250; the fourth runner-up wins $100.", "lang": "en"}
