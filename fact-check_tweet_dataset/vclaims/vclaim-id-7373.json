They didn't know she was a representative of the Russian government, and indeed, she's not a representative of the Russian government. So, this is much ado about nothing.\n\n\"I don't even know if they knew she was Russian at the time,\" Giuliani added during the Aug. 19 interview.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s claim is starkly at odds with the facts.\n\nEmails between Donald Trump Jr., and his father\u2019s business associate \u2014 emails that the younger Trump himself published on Twitter \u2014 directly contradict Giuliani\u2019s assertion.\n\nOn June 3, 2016, Donald Trump Jr. received an email from Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump senior. Their correspondence set in motion the Trump Tower meeting that would take place six days later.\n\nIn emails, Goldstone told the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father\u2019s candidacy, and that a Russian government official could pass on incriminating evidence against Clinton.\n\n\"The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary (Clinton) and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,\" Goldstone wrote.\n\n\"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump,\" he added, noting that a \"Russian government attorney\" would be willing to meet with Trump Jr.\n\nThe younger Trump replied: \"If it\u2019s what you say I love it.\"\n\nTrump Jr. forwarded the email chain to then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the elder Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nDays later, on June 9, Trump Jr. and campaign members met with a Russian national and several others. According to reports, at least eight people attended the meeting.\n\nThe key Russian national was Natalia Veselnitskaya, who Goldstone referred to in his email to Trump Jr. as a \"Russian government attorney.\"\n\nVeselnitskaya later acknowledged having close connections with Russian prosecutors. In her capacity as an attorney, she has counted Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior government official among her clients.\n\nVeselnitskaya has denied having ever worked for the Russian government. But around the time of the meeting \u2014 and contrary to Giuliani\u2019s claim \u2014 she entered the Trump orbit based on a promise that she was acting as a Russian government agent who could bruise the Clinton campaign.\n\nThis fact may prove legally significant. While experts cautioned against drawing any premature legal conclusions, they told us the Trump Tower interaction raised serious concerns about whether U.S. federal election law was broken.\n\nGiuliani said the Trump campaign \"didn\u2019t know\" that Natalia Veselnitskaya \"was a representative of the Russian government\" or even Russian.\n\nEmails between Trump Jr., and his father\u2019s business associate \u2014 emails that the younger Trump himself published \u2014 directly contradict Giuliani\u2019s assertion.\n\nThose emails show Trump senior\u2019s business associate Rob Goldstone telling the younger Trump that a \"Russian government attorney\" would be willing to meet with Trump Jr. to supply the campaign with incriminating evidence against Clinton.\n\nThe younger Trump replied: \"If it\u2019s what you say I love it\" \u2014 and several days later, the meeting took place.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
