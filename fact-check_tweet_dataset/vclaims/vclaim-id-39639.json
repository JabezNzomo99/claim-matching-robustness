Yet both also have tapped millions of dollars left over from previous campaigns \u2014 from a time when they had not yet adopted the strict fundraising practices they currently follow. That complicates their claim to \u201c100 percent\u201d grass-roots purity.\n\nTime magazine reported in December 2015: \u201cSanders has hosted at least nine medium- to high-dollar, closed-door fundraisers in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere to directly fund his own presidential campaign. Even though Sanders\u2019 efforts sometimes have a proletarian flair \u2014 he held one $200-per-ticket fundraiser at a dive bar near a grungy Seattle park \u2014 some aspects of the Democratic insurgent\u2019s fundraising are similar to the candidates he condemns.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported in October 2015: \u201cMr. Sanders was cheered at a fancy campaign fund-raiser at the Hollywood home of Syd Leibovitch, a high-end real estate agent, and his wife, Linda, on Wednesday night. Tickets for the event sold for a minimum of $250. Those who spent the maximum, $2,700, or who raised $10,000, were invited to a \u2018pre-event reception,\u2019 according to the invitation.\u201d\n\nFor her 2018 Senate reelection campaign, Warren raised money at events with high-dollar donors. A search of her FEC records showed max contributions of $5,400 from the chief executives of DreamWorks and Yelp, media mogul Haim Saban, philanthropist Alexander Soros, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, hedge fund owners and wealthy investors, and some donors who have given millions to the Democratic Party. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, film director Steven Spielberg and actress Barbra Streisand each donated $2,700 to Warren\u2019s Senate campaign. (The contribution limit for individuals is $2,700 per race, but they can give that amount for both a primary and general election.)\n\nWarren raised $6 million in donations of $1,000 or more to her 2018 Senate campaign, a spokesman said. That\u2019s about 23 percent of her total $25.8 million fundraising for that race. According to OpenSecrets, Sanders raised nearly $28 million in donations of $1,000 or more to his 2016 presidential campaign, a little more than 10 percent of his total $232 million haul for that race.\n\n\u201cElizabeth\u2019s schedule is filled with town halls and selfie lines, not closed-door fundraisers with millionaires and billionaires, because she believes that to take back the White House we need to build a grassroots movement,\u201d Warren spokesman Chris Hayden wrote in an email. \u201cWhen we made the decision to run the campaign this way, the players in the usual money-for-influence game dismissed it as naive and said it would never work and it would kill the campaign. We're pleased that our grassroots strategy has been so effective that they're now threatened enough to be attacking us for it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
