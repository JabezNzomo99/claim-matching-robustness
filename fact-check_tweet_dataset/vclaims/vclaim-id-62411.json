My forefathers and foremothers were on the First and Second Fleets. It was a pretty brutal place, but there was no slavery in Australia.\"\n\nIs it correct that there was no slavery in Australia when NSW was founded as a colony? RMIT ABC Fact Check delves into history.\n\nHis claim goes to the question of whether there was slavery when NSW was founded as a colony.\n\nAs harsh as the new settlement undoubtedly was, the preconditions for slavery \u2014 including the treatment of individuals as property \u2014 were not met, at least not in the early years of NSW.\n\nArthur Phillip, the first governor of the new colony, declared that among the first laws he would like enacted was that there could be no slavery and no slaves.\n\nAs experts consulted by Fact Check pointed out, convicts sent to NSW had many legal rights not typically afforded to slaves.\n\nAlthough they were \"lent\" out to private settlers under a model known as the \"assignment system\", unlike convicts sent to other parts of the world, they could not be privately traded.\n\nPunishment could only be legally inflicted by the state, having firstly been ordered by a magistrate.\n\nConvicts could, among other things, appear as witnesses in court and petition the governor.\n\nThey were freed after the expiry of their sentences, and their children were born free in the eyes of the law.\n\nMoreover, convicts could, with some constraints, sell some of their labour to the free market, and were encouraged to grow food in their private time.\n\nThe question of whether or not Australia had slavery when NSW was founded as a colony does not take into account other aspects of Australia's often troubled history spanning more than two centuries.\n\nThat history is replete with examples of practices that might be regarded as forms of slavery, including forcibly removing Indigenous people from their families and incarcerating them in institutions where they were trained to labour for colonists, among other things.\n\nMr Morrison\u2019s claim was interpreted by some as referring to slavery since NSW was settled as a colony.\n\nFor example, various commentators have pointed out that tens of thousands of Melanesian people were brought to Australia to work on sugar plantations as bonded labourers between 1863 and 1904 under a bonded labouring system known as\n\n\"blackbirding\" that could be viewed as a form a slavery (though this is debated by historians).\n\nIt has also been noted, including in the 2006 Senate report, Unfinished business: Indigenous stolen wages, that many Indigenous Australians were denied wages and forced to work in conditions akin to slavery.\n\nHowever, Mr Morrison put a clear time frame on his claim by stating there was no slavery in Australia when it \"was founded as a settlement\".\n\nHe also refers to his forefathers and foremothers as being on the First and Second Fleets, which arrived in 1788 and 1790 respectively.\n\nDuring a news conference held shortly after his radio interview, Mr Morrison said he did not intend his comments to be offensive, while clarifying his position as referring to there being no \"lawful slavery\" at the time NSW was settled as a colony.\n\nFact Check consequently examined Mr Morrison\u2019s claim on the basis of whether slavery existed during the early years of the colony, established by Arthur Phillip in January, 1788.\n\nThis somewhat narrows the question to whether or not the early convicts were treated as slaves.\n\nThis is not to argue that slavery did or did not exist in various lawful and unlawful guises after this period.\n\nThe United Nations Slavery Convention, signed in Geneva on September 25, 1926, defines slavery as \"the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised\".\n\nIt adds: \"The slave trade includes all acts involved in the capture, acquisition or disposal of a person with intent to reduce him to slavery; all acts involved in the acquisition of a slave with a view to selling or exchanging him; all acts of disposal by sale or exchange of a slave acquired with a view to being sold or exchanged, and, in general, every act of trade or transport in slaves.\"\n\nIn Australia, the 1999 Criminal Code Amendment (Slavery and Sexual Servitude) Act defines slavery in a similar manner, as \"the condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised, including where such a condition results from a debt or contract made by the person.\"\n\nIn the book The Fatal Shore, which explores the convict era, historian Robert Hughes was more expansive with his definition when analysing whether convicts could be compared to slaves:\n\nFact Check was unable to find a clear historical definition of slavery that would have applied in the 1780s and 1790s, at the time of the First and Second Fleets.\n\nPerhaps because the slave trade was such a palpable part of commerce at the time, involving the capture, transportation and sale of mostly African people, it did not require a concise definition in the minds of those debating the subject.\n\nWas slavery explicitly banned when Australia was first colonised?\n\nNSW was established as a penal colony around the time debates about slavery were gaining momentum in Britain.\n\nAbolitionists such as William Wilberforce graphically described the horrors of the slave trade, including in a famous speech to British Parliament delivered in 1789, the year following the arrival of the First Fleet, and the year before the arrival of the Second Fleet.\n\nGovernor Phillip was appointed as the representative of the crown across a massive area roughly covering the eastern half of Australia and extending into the Pacific.\n\nHe was given almost complete authority.\n\nAs the Australian Dictionary of Biography puts it:\n\nIn 1787, Phillip set out details of how he intended the convicts would be treated following the fleet\u2019s arrival in the new colony.\n\nAmong his many rulings was an edict which he said would take place from the moment of arrival: there would be \"no slaves\".\n\n\"The laws of this country will, of course, be introduced in [New] South Wales, and there is one that I would wish to take from the moment his Majesty\u2019s forces take possession of the country: That there can be no slavery in a free land, and consequently no slaves.\"\n\nPhillip\u2019s argument was that laws that applied in England would also apply in the new colony. Unlike America, slavery, as a trade, had long been banned in England although the legal status of slaves brought from the New World to England was seen as ambiguous.\n\nThe Somerset ruling of 1772, some 15 years before Phillip proclaimed there could be \"no slaves\" in NSW, found that \"no master ever was allowed here [England] to take a slave by force to be sold abroad because he deserted from his service\".\n\nIt did not mean emancipation of slaves in England, but it did mean no slave could be forcibly taken from Britain and sold into slavery.\n\nIn The Fatal Shore, Hughes describes Phillip\u2019s words as the only ones \"verging on the description of a social ideal that would be muttered in, or about, Australia for the rest of the 18th century\".\n\nWas the treatment of convicts akin to slavery?\n\nThe question of whether the convicts transported to NSW could be considered slaves has been much debated.\n\nThe scathing Molesworth inquiry report to the British House of Commons of 1837 argued that the transportation of the convicts was a form a slavery.\n\n\"Transportation, though chiefly dreaded as exile, undoubtedly is much more than exile; it is slavery as well; and the condition of the convict slave is frequently a very miserable one \u2026\"\n\nCan the concept slavery, as defined above, be applied to the early convict experience?\n\nStuart Macintyre, a professor of history at the University of Melbourne, said although critics of the transportation system often likened convicts to slaves \"they were not\".\n\n\"Their condition was less favourable than that of bonded labour (those who sold their service for an extended period) but they had civil rights denied to slaves, and these were tighter than had operated previously when convicts were sent to America (strictly sold to contractors who in turn sold their services over there),\" Professor Macintyre told Fact Check in an email.\n\nJennie Jeppesen, an expert in early convict law from the University of Melbourne, said convicts were not slaves. Rather, they were part of a system of coerced, unfree labour.\n\nDr Jeppesen said unlike slaves or convicts sent to work in the United States (specifically, the state of Virginia), Australian convicts were never the property of private individuals.\n\nIn a legal sense, Dr Jeppesen said, the services of convicts upon their arrival in NSW were controlled by the state, and, although convicts were \"lent\" out to private individuals under a framework known as the \"assignment system\", they were never bought or sold.\n\n\"There is a big difference between a convict in the American context who is traded and sold \u2026 and a convict in the Australian context,\" Dr Jeppesen told Fact Check.\n\nConvicts, for example, could not be moved between employers without a court order, and could be taken away from employers in cases of mistreatment.\n\nMoreover, by law, convicts could only be punished by the state, on the orders of a magistrate.\n\nUnlike slaves, convicts also had some control over their labour.\n\nGovernor Phillip, for example, set working hours for convicts from 5am to 3pm to allow convicts time to cultivate their own food.\n\nKristyn Harman, an associate professor at the University of Tasmania and an expert in early colonial history, said convicts could be assigned to public works or to private individuals.\n\n\"For a number of reasons, this did not, in my view, amount to slavery,\" Associate Professor Harman told Fact Check in an email.\n\n\"Convict women and men were able to exercise agency and could act in ways that saw them removed from the service of masters or mistresses for whom they no longer wished to labour. They could be reassigned or returned to hiring depots or other places of incarceration.\"\n\nSome convicts even had bank accounts, she added.\n\n\"Once convicts had completed their set hours of labour for the day or week, they could then market their skills to others willing to pay to employ them privately for work completed outside of the convict system.\n\n\"They were therefore able to earn private income. Some convicts had bank accounts for which records still survive. And, of course, those who did not die within the convict system could eventually gain their ticket of leave (a forerunner to today\u2019s probation) or certificate of freedom when their sentence expired (their original sentence may have been extended once or multiple times, though, depending on whether they were found guilty of committing other offences while they were convicts).\"\n\nIn The Fatal Shore, Robert Hughes argued that none of the conditions of slavery applied to the convicts exiled to Australia, with convicts serving a fixed term of punishment before being freed.\n\n\"All of them, within limits, had the right to sell some portion of their labour on the free market. Harsh and rigorous as their social world often was, it was replaced by concepts of right and law, not of simple ownership,\" Hughes wrote.\n\nWhat about the treatment of the Indigenous population?\n\nThere are numerous examples since 1788 of Indigenous Australians being kept against their will, forcibly removed from their families and incarcerated in \"training\" homes or schools to be trained as labour for colonists.\n\nIn her book Aboriginal Convicts: Australian, Khoisan, and Maori Exiles, Associate Professor Harman describes how more than 60 Aboriginal men from the eastern Australian colonies were incorporated into the convict system and laboured alongside other convicts (including some indigenous convicts from other British colonies).\n\nShe said while the Australian colonies were replete with examples of forced labour, slavery did not exist in the strict contemporary sense of the term, in that people were not owned as chattels and nor were they born into slavery.\n\n\"However, I fully respect the views of some Indigenous Australians that slavery did, indeed, exist in Australia and that they and their kin were enslaved by colonists through being kept against their will in various institutions.\n\n\"Being born Aboriginal could certainly see people taken away from their families and incarcerated in training homes and other such institutions where they were trained to labour for colonists.\"\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the 2006 Senate report, Unfinished business: Indigenous stolen wages, noted that Indigenous Australians were routinely denied wages and forced to work in conditions akin to slavery.\n\nHowever, these practices, however abhorrent, did not tend to apply to the era of the First and Second Fleets referred to by Mr Morrison.\n\u2022 Thalia Anthony, Stephen Gray, 'Was there slavery in Australia?
