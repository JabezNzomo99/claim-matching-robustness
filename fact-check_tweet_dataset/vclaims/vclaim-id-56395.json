Kremlin. Putin.\" broadcast by Rossiya-1 state television on June 21.\n\nIn the documentary, Putin said that with the Soviet Union\u2019s breakup in 1991, some of the newly independent former Soviet republics took away \u201cRussia's traditionally historic territories\" they had acquired while part of the Soviet Union. These states should have \u201cleft with what they arrived, rather than taking with them gifts from the Russian people,\u201d Putin said.\n\nPutin claimed that when the Soviet Union was created, the right to leave it was written into its founding documents, but the procedure for quitting was not specified.\n\n\"Putin talked about previous systemic mistakes in the constitution that failed to envision a whole number of situations, developments which could have negative consequences for our state,\" Peskov stated. He declined to comment on Putin's use of the word \"gifts\" but stated:\n\n\u201cNo, Russia doesn\u2019t have any territorial claims against its neighbors.\u201d\n\nThat is misleading. Call it \u201cclaims\u201d or not, Russia\u2019s territorial meddling with neighbors is fact.\n\nLet\u2019s start with some Soviet history and international law.\n\nThe former Soviet republics emerged as independent states within the territories they possessed before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, following the principle Uti possidetis juris \u2013 Latin for \"as you possess under law.\" According to international law, \u201cnew states will come to independence with the same boundaries that they had when they were administrative units within the territory or territories of one colonial power.\u201d Uti possidetis juris has been applied in numerous regions, such as South America, Africa, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.\n\nDuring its roughly 70-year existence, the Soviet Union\u2019s borders changed many times. They expanded in the 1930s and 1940s with annexation of the Baltic states, Bessarabia, Eastern Galicia and Karelia, to name a few. Its internal borders were repeatedly redrawn by creating or abolishing autonomous republics. Abkhazia became an autonomous republic in Georgia in 1931, the Karakalpak Autonomous Republic was made part of Uzbekistan in 1936. Crimea was transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954.\n\nIn the 1940s, the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) was at first divided between Stavropol Krai, the Dagestani ASSR, the North Ossetian ASSR, and the Georgian SSR, then restored in 1957. Finally, in May 1991, it was declared the independent Checheno-Ingush Republic and subsequently split into the Chechen Republic and the Republic of Ingushetia.\n\nThe 15 Soviet republics, as defined by the December 1922 treaty creating the Soviet Union, became independent states within their existing borders, which became international borders.\n\nIn the documentary, Putin did not specify which of the former republics took \u201cgifts,\u201d but it can be assumed he meant Crimea. The peninsula has had multiple identities over time.\n\nThe Russian Empire annexed Crimea from the Ottoman Empire in 1783. Under Soviet rule, Crimea became an autonomous republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In 1954, the peninsula was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nBetween February and March 2014, Russia took over. The annexation was preceded by a hybrid warfare campaign involving masked Russian soldiers, the so-called \u201clittle green men\u201d who supported local radicals. On March 16, 2014, Russia conducted a referendum for Crimea and Sevastopol to join Russia. Two days after the referendum, the Russian Federation signed a treaty of accession for Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.\n\nSince then, these annexed Ukrainian territories have been administered as two Russian federal subjects \u2013 the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol. (A United Nations resolution supported by 100 countries condemned the 2014 Crimean annexation, and the United States and others have imposed economic sanctions on Russia as punishment.)\n\nRussia\u2019s de facto annexation of the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia dates to 2008. The two autonomous republics fought wars in the early 1990s. Following a ceasefire between Tskhinvali (South Ossetia) and Tbilisi (Georgia) in 1992, and between Sukhumi (Abkhazia) and Tbilisi in 1994, Russian peacekeepers were deployed in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. These territories remained beyond the control of Georgia\u2019s central government, and the local de facto authorities enjoyed Russian protection and influence.\n\nRussian peacekeepers remained until the Russian military officially arrived with the 2008 Russo-Georgian war. The war erupted that August following worsening relations between Russia and Georgia. Russia occupied both these territories and, on August 26, 2008, declared them as independent states.\n\nNow, Abkhazia and South Ossetia are effectively under the control of Russia, which has been enhancing its grip. On Nov. 24, 2014, Russia and Abkhazia signed an Alliance and Integration Treaty, under which Abkhazia coordinates its foreign, defense, economic and social policies with Moscow.\n\nThe treaty also created a joint Russian-Abkhazian military unit and a \u201cjoint information/co-ordination center of the organs of internal affairs.\u201d Georgia denounced the move as a step towards the \u201cannexation of Georgia\u2019s occupied territories\u201d by Russia.\n\nIn March 2015, South Ossetia signed a similar agreement, handing over control of its border, military, and economy to Russia. That treaty also created a joint defense and security zone and integrated South Ossetia\u2019s and Russia\u2019s customs agencies. Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili saw this as an attempt to bring the Russia occupation \u201cto the level of an annexation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis 'treaty' \u2013 which includes references to a transfer of powers in some areas \u2013 clearly violates Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" EU Foreign Policy coordinator Federica Mogherini said.\n\nRussia stirred an ongoing secessionist conflict in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, which has resulted in large parts of its Donetsk and Luhansk territories separating from the central Ukrainian government. Estimates are that more than 13,000 have died in fighting since 2014. A Russian-sourced missile is believed to been used to shoot down a Malaysian passenger jet MH-17 that year, killing all 298 aboard.\n\nNone of these separatist territories \u2013 Luhansk and Donetsk in Ukraine, and the statelets of Transnistria (in Moldova), South Ossetia and Abkhazia \u2013 have been recognized internationally. They survive thanks only to Russia\u2019s protection and support.", "lang": "en"}
