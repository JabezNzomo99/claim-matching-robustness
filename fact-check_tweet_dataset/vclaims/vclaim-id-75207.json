There may also be search results where different\n\npublishers vetted the same claim and arrived at different conclusions.\n\nThe fact checks are not done by Google but are presented so that users can make more informed decisions, the company said.\n\n\"Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it\u2019s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree,\" Justin Kosslyn, product manager at Jigsaw, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google's parent company) and research scientist Cong Yu, wrote in a blog The Keyword.\n\nThe new Fact Check feature will not affect the order of search results or rankings of sites doing the fact checks, nor will it label sites known to spread false information as untrustworthy.\n\nIf users disagree with the results of a fact check, they should contact the website owner that published it , Google said.\n\nHow does it work for publishers?\n\nGoogle said for publishers to be included, they should be using the online collaborative community Schema.org's\n\nClaimReview markup on the specific pages where they fact check public statements, or they can use a 'Share the\n\nFacts' widget developed by the Duke University Reporters Lab and Jigsaw.\n\nOnly publishers that were algorithmically determined to be an authoritative source of information will qualify for\n\nGoogle said fact checks carried out by publishers need to meet certain requirements for its search page to carry a\n\n1) An algorithm will determine if the publisher of a fact check can be taken as a trusted source of information.\n\n2) The fact check must clearly spell out the following.\n\nc) How they arrived at that conclusion", "lang": "en"}
