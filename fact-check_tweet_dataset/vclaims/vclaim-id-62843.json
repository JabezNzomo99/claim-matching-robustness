These helicopters are particularly effective against armoured formations like tanks and infantry vehicles. These tanks and infantry have been deployed in strength by the Chinese side along LAC in Eastern Ladakh. In a more recent development, top military commanders of Indian and Chinese armies held a meeting in Ladakh's Chushul on July 1 as part of their third attempt to ease tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as Indian forces ramped up deployment along the border in a response to China's aggressive build-up of force. Video shows Apache helicopters flying over Pangong Lake in Ladakh as part of Indian Army build-up to counter China A Google Reverse Image search was done by breaking the video into individual frames using InVid and related keyword search led to a Facebook Page called Hangar 24 Craft Brewing, which had posted the video on June 23. \"Hangar 24 Lake Havasu City Hangar 24 Orange County Hangar 24 Redlands,\" reads the caption of the video.\n\nFurther, the IAF insignia (roundel) and tricolour stamp (green white orange stripes) are missing on the helicopters in the viral video. The Indian Air Force had tweeted photos of Apache helicopters on May 2019 when India had first acquired it.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343 Also Read: Fact Check: No, You Are Not Being Tracked By Apple, Google's 'Exposure Notifications System'", "lang": "en"}
