Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post\n\nFact: The video is an old one. The same video was found to be published on YouTube in December 2013. So, it is not related to COVID-19 deaths in the State. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn listening to the audio in the posted video, it is found that there is no mention of COVID-19 anywhere in the video. So, when we searched with the keywords \u2013 \u2018Osmania dead bodies\u2019, the same video was found in the search results. The video was found to be uploaded by \u2018Ind ToDay\u2019 on their YouTube channel in December 2013 with the title \u2013 \u2018Unclaimed bodies pile up at OGH mortuary | Hyderabad Osmania General Hospital\u2019. So, the video is not related to COVID-19.\n\nAlso, the same visuals can be seen in another video uploaded on YouTube in 2013. In the video, Kishan Reddy (then MLA and current Union Minister of State for Home Affairs) is seen asking the State government to provide proper cremation to the dead bodies piled up at the Osmania Mortuary.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video of Osmania mortuary from 2013 falsely linked to COVID-19 deaths.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
