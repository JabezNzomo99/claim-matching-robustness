Floyd had a criminal conviction for a 2007 aggravated robbery ( here , here ).\n\nVera Lynn\u2019s picture is shown alongside Floyd\u2019s with the label \u201cBritish Icon\u201d.\n\n\u201cGuess whose funeral the BBC decided to show live?\u201d, the text says. Many users have responded with comments critical of the BBC.\n\nThe post makes a false assertion based on misleading information. Lynn\u2019s funeral on July 10 was a private event at a crematorium in Brighton ( here, here ), which is why no coverage took place.\n\nThe beginning of the funeral procession was public, however \u2013 and this part was broadcast live. It showed the cortege leaving Lynn\u2019s home in Ditchling, Sussex, and pausing at a crossroads for mourners to pay their respects and to wait for a Royal Air Force flypast in honour of the singer, who died in June at the age of 103. This was shown in the BBC broadcast ( here ).\n\nThe BBC confirmed to Reuters in an email that it broadcast the procession live. The funeral of Floyd, whose death provoked protests around the world, was shown live on June 9 here .\n\nFalse. The BBC did not decide against broadcasting Vera Lynn\u2019s funeral. The funeral was private, but the BBC did broadcast live coverage earlier of her funeral cortege.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
