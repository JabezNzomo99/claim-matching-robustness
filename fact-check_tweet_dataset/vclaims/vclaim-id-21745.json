Marco Rubio of Florida suggested on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that there\u2019s no need for President Barack Obama to even try making a nomination.\n\n\"But why not go through this process?\" host Chuck Todd asked.\n\n\"Because actually, it's not just for the Supreme Court, even for appellate courts, both parties have followed this precedent,\" Rubio responded. \"There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating, or you stop the advice and consent process.\"\n\nIs it true that presidents \"stop nominating\" both Supreme Court and appellate court judges in their last year in office?\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from the Rubio campaign, but our research shows Rubio is overstating matters.\n\nLet\u2019s first note that the scenario that Rubio is describing \u2014 a Supreme Court vacancy in the last year of a presidency \u2014 is pretty rare to begin with. Since 1900, it\u2019s only happened once to a \"lame duck\" president, and twice more to presidents who lost re-election bids. All three times, the exiting president made nominations:\n\u2022 1968: President Lyndon Johnson \u2014 who announced he would not run for re-election \u2014 nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas as Chief Justice and Homer Thornberry to fill Fortas\u2019 vacancy. Fortas\u2019 nomination failed, Thornberry withdrew his nomination and Chief Justice Earl Warren remained on the bench, delaying his retirement. (More on this later.)\n\u2022 1912: President William Taft successfully nominated Mahlon Pitney to the Supreme Court. Taft lost to Woodrow Wilson.\n\nThree other presidents made successful Supreme Court nominations while running for re-election, but unlike Taft and Hoover, they won another term:\n\nWhen it comes to the lower courts, Rubio is on even less firm ground, experts told us.\n\n\"He\u2019s clearly wrong,\" said Russell Wheeler, a judicial expert with the Brookings Institution. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the most recent examples of lower court nominations made in the last year of a presidency, courtesy of Wheeler:\n\nConfusion over judicial confirmations in the election years stems from the \"myth of the so-called \u2018Thurmond Rule,\u2019 \" said Wheeler. Named for former Sen. Strom Thurmond, who opposed Johnson\u2019s 1968 Supreme Court nominations, the informal rule suggests that judicial nominations shouldn\u2019t be confirmed in the months leading up to a president election.\n\nThough Wheeler and all the other experts we spoke with agreed that it becomes increasingly difficult to push through a nominee as the end of a presidency nears, the Thurmond Rule doesn\u2019t actually hold up.\n\nFor example, George W. Bush forwarded nominees to the Court of Appeals \"as late as September of his last year in office,\" said Lisa Holmes, a University of Vermont professor who specializes in judicial politics.\n\nAnd that month, the Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee \"shepherded through\" many of Bush\u2019s nominations even though \"it did look very promising for President Obama\" at the time, said Sheldon Goldman, a University of Massachusetts at Amherst professor who specializes in the politics of judicial selection.\n\nThe evidence against Rubio\u2019s claim also multiplies if we expand the criteria to beyond lame-duck presidents. From 1947 to 2014, there have been 79 appellate court nominations and 416 District Court nominations in presidential election years, according to Sarah Binder, a George Washington University professor who studies the federal judiciary.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s an example sitting on the Supreme Court right now that contradicts Rubio, pointed out Goldman. Justice Stephen Breyer was nominated by Jimmy Carter to the Court of Appeals in November of 1980, after Ronald Reagan won the White House.\n\nRubio said, \"There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating\" both Supreme Court justices and Court of Appeals judges. Rubio suggested that point is now.\n\nThe chance for an outgoing president to make a Supreme Court nomination in his last year in office has only happened once in the past century, in 1968.\n\nBut presidents do continue to nominate appellate judges in their final year. Out of the last four presidents who served two terms, all of them made nominations to the Court of Appeals (as well as the District Courts) in their last year.\n\nCorrection: Ronald Reagan's final full year in office was 1988.
