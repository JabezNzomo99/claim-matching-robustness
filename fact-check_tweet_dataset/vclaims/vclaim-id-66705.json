In it, he attacked Republican incumbent Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s budget decisions. \"Rick Scott raised property taxes,\" the ad said. A narrator doubles down on the claim, saying Scott raised \"your\" property taxes.\n\nScott came into office promising to cut property taxes, so PolitiFact Florida thought this claim deserved an audit. Did Rick Scott raise Florida\u2019s property taxes? We\u2019ll budget some time to sort this one out.\n\nCrist\u2019s campaign said the claim came from a May 5, 2014, story in the Tampa Tribune detailing a projected increase in the property taxes municipalities contribute to public schools.\n\nThis portion of your property tax bill, called the Required Local Effort, has been a Scott target since his 2010 campaign, when he promised to cut the rate first by one and later by two mills over seven years (we rated both ).\n\nBoth the Legislature and the governor have a say in the millage rate, which is used to calculate taxes on the assessed value of a property (one mill is equal to $1 in taxes per $1,000 in value). When Scott took office, the rate was 5.38 mills, which then went up to 5.446 in 2011, but was set at 5.18 in 2013.\n\nFor 2014, Scott and the Legislature didn\u2019t move the rate either up or down, leaving it at 5.18. Because of the way the rate is calculated, the state Department of Education in July adjusted the rate down to 5.08 mills . That\u2019s important to note, because that means this year\u2019s rate is actually lower than the year before.\n\nWith a steady increase in property values across the state, the current rate will be bringing in more tax money than before, despite no action from the governor or lawmakers.\n\n\"If Charlie Crist is accusing us of raising property tax rates, that\u2019s just not true,\" Scott campaign spokesperson Matt Moon told PolitiFact Florida. Instead, Crist is focusing on the higher tax revenue.\n\nThe latest Florida Education Finance Program calculations from the Department of Education estimate collections for the Required Local Effort would increase by about $370 million in an $18.9 billion budget.\n\nCritics (including the Crist campaign) have equated that rise in collections with a tax increase. Crist campaign spokesman Kevin Cate told PolitiFact Florida \"inaction is also an action. And in this case, Rick Scott\u2019s actions raised taxes.\"\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, the same logic could apply to Crist.\n\nThe campaign doesn\u2019t mention that Crist also oversaw changes in both the tax rate and collections from the Required Local Effort. We checked going back to before former Gov. Crist took office in 2007 and found that Crist also saw ups and downs among both.\n\nMost notable is 2007, Crist\u2019s first year, when the budget lowered the tax rate. But because of increasing taxable values just before the Great Recession, tax collections still went up. In subsequent years, Crist-era budgets kept raising the tax rate but saw falling collections by the end of his term.\n\nThe current rate and projected collections under Scott are both less than they were during Crist\u2019s last approved budget.\n\nAs Florida homeowners know, the taxes they pay are based on both tax rates and what the current property values are. What Crist means is that because taxable values are rising, collections from school property taxes are going up, even though the tax rate for the Required Local Effort is not going up.\n\nScott did sign a budget his first year that briefly raised those rates, but collections dropped anyway -- a phenomenon that happened to Crist, as well. Even as collections are projected to increase, both the rates and tax revenue are now less than when Scott took office. Collections are increasing because property values are going up after a historic recession and loss of real estate values.\n\nGiven all these factors, we rate Crist\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
