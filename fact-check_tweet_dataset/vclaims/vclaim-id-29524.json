All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Hemingway said this quote. The first known attribution to the novelist appeared years after his death.\n\nHemingway was a Nobel Prize-winning author famous for works like \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d and \u201cFor Whom The Bell Tolls.\u201d\n\nHis writings show that he did consider writing to be a challenge. \u201cWriting is something that you can never do as well as it can be done,\u201d he said in an August 1935 letter. \u201cIt is a perpetual challenge and it is more difficult than anything else that I have ever done \u2013 so I do it. And it makes me happy when I do it well.\u201d\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no reason to believe that Hemingway equated writing with bleeding, as the Facebook post claims. The quote appears nowhere in his collected works or selected letters.\n\n\u201cThis quote is one of the most persistent of the apocryphal Hemingway quotes, but no one has ever been able to pin down its origin,\u201d Verna Kale, assistant research professor at Penn State University and associate editor of \u201cThe Letters of Ernest Hemingway,\u201d told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\nThe first known attribution to Hemingway occurred in 1973, more than a decade after his death, according to the website Quote Investigator.\n\nThe saying may have originated in print during the 1940s, when sportswriter Walter Wellesley \u201cRed\u201d Smith was asked whether he had difficulty writing a daily column. \u201cWhy, no,\u201d he was quoted as saying in 1949. \u201cYou simply sit down at the typewriter, open your veins, and bleed.\u201d\n\nAmerican writer Paul Gallico penned a similar metaphor in 1946. \u201cIt is only when you open your veins and bleed onto the page a little that you establish contact with your reader,\u201d he said in \u201cConfessions of a Story Writer.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
