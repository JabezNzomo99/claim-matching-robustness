The FTBA, the organization mentioned on the card to \u201creport\u201d potential violations to, also does not appear to be officially recognized by any government agencies as an enforcing body.\n\nThe ADA requires that businesses with mandatory mask rules for customers due to COVID-19 also must accommodate people who may not be able to wear masks due to medical conditions or disabilities. In many cases individuals do not need to disclose or provide proof of those medical conditions.\n\nMandatory mask-wearing in public gradually became the law of the land in regions across the United States in 2020 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. Seemingly in response to such regulations, images of cards and flyers citing the Department of Justice (DOJ) began cropping up across the internet, proclaiming certain laws made the bearer exempt from wearing face masks\n\nThese cards were shared on California-based Facebook groups in June, around the same time the state issued an executive order requiring Californians to wear face masks in public. Snopes readers asked us if the cards were valid. We learned they were not.\n\nPresented like a business card, it mislabeled the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as singular \u201cDisability\u201d act, included the ADA information line\u2018s phone number, and claimed there would be steep fines for any violation.\n\nIn an announcement on ADA.gov, while not explicitly referencing the above card, the Department of Justice (DOJ) declared such postings or flyers on the internet that used its seal as fraudulent. The San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department, California, reiterated this:\n\nThe Freedom to Breathe Agency (FTBA), according to its Facebook page, was previously known as the Anti-Mask Task Force, and described itself as a \u201cmovement of proud American citizens who are dedicated to protecting their freedom and liberty.\u201d They would not be able to enforce any action against offenders because they are not connected to a government agency.\n\nBut the card\u2019s fake credentials implied that able-bodied bearers could exploit legitimate ADA regulations meant to protect people with disabilities. Snopes fact-checked a similar story in May 2020, when we learned that the ADA requires that businesses with mandatory mask regulations must accommodate individuals who cannot wear masks due to their health or a disability.\n\nCoinciding with claims made in the card\u2019s text, in many parts of the U.S., people aren\u2019t required to disclose their physical condition if a business asks for proof of disability. But able-bodied people who seek to exploit such protections would not be supported by the ADA if, for example, they tried to sue a business for refusing them entry. In our previous investigation, we reached out to numerous ADA centers across the country. The New England ADA Center, for instance, told us:\n\nIn sum, even though their arguments rely on existing protections for people with disabilities, such cards arguing that bearers can be exempted from wearing masks are totally fake. We thus rate this claim as \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
