Of course not all the public spending cuts would fall on the NHS. But it could still be as much as \u00a310 billion a year by the end of the decade.\u201d\n\nIn a speech delivered yesterday, Frances O\u2019Grady of the TUC claimed that the yearly cost to the government of leaving the EU would be equivalent to about 25% of the total budget of NHS England\u2014so enough to fund it for three months.\n\nMost economists agree that the government's budget would suffer, if the UK left the EU.\n\nThe claim has been properly qualified and the figures add up. The TUC\u2019s analysis takes average cost to the government budget predicted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent think-tank, and compares them to the projected annual budget for NHS England in 2019-20.\n\nThe IFS builds on the view of most economists, that the economy would suffer if we left the EU, to show how this would affect government finances.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting quickly that economic models are never perfect.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that less money would be spent on the NHS.\n\nMs O'Grady suggests that this might mean a loss of \u00a310 billion each year to the NHS budget. This is a claim about what future political decisions on public sector spending might look like if there were less money to go around.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say whether or how many cuts would fall on the NHS, as Ms O\u2019Grady says. The Coalition government committed to increase spending on the NHS in the aftermath of the 2008/09 recession. It\u2019s possible that future governments would choose to protect NHS spending too.\n\nThe analysis also assumes that the UK government would maintain its commitment to a \u00a310.4 billion budget surplus by 2019/20.\n\nThe 'Brexit Budget' is also a hypothetical look at possible political decisions.\n\nWriting in today\u2019s Times, current Chancellor George Osborne and his predecessor Alistair Darling also draw on the IFS calculations in framing their own hypothetical Brexit budget.\n\nThe pair say that a post-Brexit government would have to plug a \u201c\u00a330 billion a year black hole\u201d in the public finances. This is the middle of a range suggested by the IFS for the possible cost of leaving the EU to the government\u2019s budget, from \u00a320bn to \u00a340bn by 2019/20.\n\nMr Osborne and Mr Darling suggest that if half of the \u00a330 billion were covered through extra taxes and the other half through extra cuts, the NHS could be asked to take a \u00a32.5 billion hit (about 2% of its budget).\n\nAgain, it\u2019s important to distinguish between two steps in the analysis.\n\nThe first suggestion is that leaving the EU would cost the government overall, a view shared by most economists.\n\nThe second is a set of judgements about what impact these additional costs might have on future political choices about public sector taxation, borrowing and spending. Any cost to the NHS budget would be the result of political decisions about public sector spending, not a direct economic consequence of leaving the EU.", "lang": "en"}
