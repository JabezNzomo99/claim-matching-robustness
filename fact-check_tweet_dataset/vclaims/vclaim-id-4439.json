It suggests that he has \"severe cancer\" and every share will generate money for his care.\n\nThe post, which has gotten over 141,000 shares, reads:\n\n\"This boy has severe cancer. Facebook will donate 1 dollar for every share! Type AMEN and SHARE!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because it isn\u2019t true. Facebook does not make donations based on the number of shares or comments a particular post or photo may receive.\n\nThe post is an example of a long-running scam that is employed to generate user interaction by falsely claiming that shares or comments will help pay for a sick child\u2019s care.\n\nWhile it may seem harmless at first, research indicates the tactic exploits children for another entity\u2019s personal gain, makes people believe they are helping and inadvertently bumps up the page\u2019s visibility, in turn allowing scammers to gain followers and cook up more hoaxes.\n\nIn 2015, the Better Business Bureau released a statement about such scams, calling them \"like-farming,\" and warned that some use the scheme to collect and sell information about users who interact with the posts.\n\n\"Once the page creators have piled up hundreds of likes and shares, they may strip the page and promote something else, such as products that they will receive commissions for selling,\" the organization said in the statement. \"They may also sell the page and information that was collected from the \u2018likes\u2019 with a more direct threat of gaining access in an attempt to gather credit card numbers that may be stored for certain Facebook apps, passwords or other personal information.\"\n\nThe Better Business Bureau encourages people to refrain from interacting with these posts and report them to Facebook instead.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
