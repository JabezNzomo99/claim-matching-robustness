It dates to at least 2004 \u2014 the same year that Facebook began \u2014 when John Pisciotta, an anti-abortion activist in Waco, Texas, bought ads on a local Christian radio station calling for a boycott of Girl Scout cookies.\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, host Lester Holt interviewed Pisciotta and Kathy Cloninger, who had become the CEO of the national Girl Scouts six months earlier, about a local boycott that made national headlines.\n\nPisciotta opened the interview, which took place on March 5, 2004, by praising the \u201cGirl Scouts for taking the decision to separate themselves from the controversial organization of Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nDays earlier, in response to Pisciotta\u2019s call for a boycott, \u201cthe Bluebonnet Council of Girl Scouts, which oversees troops in the Waco area and 13 other counties, announced \u2026 that it would not be affiliated with Planned Parenthood sex-education programs this year,\u201d the Associated Press reported in a March 3, 2004 story. The Girl Scouts in Waco had been affiliated only with the local Planned Parenthood\u2019s sex-education program \u2014 not with the organization\u2019s clinical services.\n\nLater in the show, Pisciotta announced that he had ended his boycott. \u201cIt is over, and I encourage everyone to go out and buy Thin Mints,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the unfounded claim that Girl Scout cookies support Planned Parenthood lives on \u2014 in large part because of Cloninger\u2019s interview that day on the \u201cToday\u201d show.\n\nHolt asked Cloninger, \u201cYou say there is no formal relationship between the Girl Scouts and Planned Parenthood. Can you describe what the relationship is or was?\u201d After criticizing Pisciotta as a \u201cbully,\u201d Cloninger went on to say:\n\nCloninger, March 5, 2004: The Girl Scouts in Waco, Texas, really made a decision based on local community context, they decided that in this particular situation that it would be in the best interest of girls and their families to discontinue the relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts is the largest voice for, and advocate for girls across the country. Know that girls grow up with very complex issues facing them. And so we do, across the country, tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the thing that\u2019s girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs, and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring information-based sex education programs to girls.\n\nThe last part of Cloninger\u2019s answer has lived on as the primary piece of evidence used by critics of the scouts.\n\nBut the national organization, Girl Scouts of the United States of America, takes no position on birth control or abortion and has no relationship with Planned Parenthood, according to its website. And it didn\u2019t at the time, either, according to the AP\u2019s 2004 story.\n\nAlso, there is no evidence of funds going to the group in the scout\u2019s 990 tax form.\n\nAs for the suggestion that cookie sales \u201csupport\u201d Planned Parenthood, there is no evidence of that, either. Proceeds from Girl Scout cookie sales stay within the local councils \u2014 that\u2019s the tier between the national organization and the troops in the Girl Scouts\u2019 structure. Those councils largely decide on the programming and events that will be offered to scouts in their area.\n\nAccording to the Girl Scout\u2019s governing rules, the councils can work with local businesses, but those businesses have to maintain \u201cpolicies and operations compatible with the values of Girl Scouting.\u201d And, of course, the national organization \u201cdoes not have a relationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood,\u201d as it says on its website.\n\nWhile the Girl Scouts don\u2019t have a relationship with Planned Parenthood, they have historically had one with the Catholic Church. Prompted by questions about the potential relationship between the Girl Scouts and Planned Parenthood (among other related questions), the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops spent two years examining the issue. It did find the \u201cpossibility of local councils or troops collaborating with or forming a relationship with Planned Parenthood to be an area of serious concern deserving close attention at the local level,\u201d but it didn\u2019t give any examples that showed a relationship between the two organizations on a local level and it didn\u2019t recommend that the church cut ties with the scouts. Rather, it recommended that dioceses develop a memorandum of understanding with local councils, as has been done by at least two dioceses.\n\nSo, although there has been concern over the years about a relationship between the Girl Scouts and Planned Parenthood, there is scant evidence that there is one.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nAssociated Press. \u201cGirl Scout cookies, and troops, crumble in Texas.\u201d NBCnews.com. 3 Mar 2004.\n\nGirl Scouts of the United States of America.
