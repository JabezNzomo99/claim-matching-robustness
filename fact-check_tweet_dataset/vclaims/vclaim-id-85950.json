And we\u2019ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 the skills today\u2019s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cOverwhelming majorities of Americans \u2014 Americans who believe in the Second Amendment \u2014 have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they\u2019re tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned.
