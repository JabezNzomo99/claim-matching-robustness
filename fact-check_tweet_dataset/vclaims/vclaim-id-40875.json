COLLINS: In January, there was a tweet. TRUMP: Well, you know, if I\u2019m so good to China, how come I was the only person \u2014 the only leader of a country that closed our borders tightly against China?\n\nSocial media users took that last comment and contrasted it with the earlier Trump remark Collins was referring to, which came in a tweet posted on Jan. 24, 2020, in which Trump did, in fact, praise the Chinese government for its transparency. Here is an example of one such tweet with the user\u2019s name cropped out for privacy purposes.\n\n \n\n Because Trump did make the transparency comment about China in regards to the coronavirus pandemic, we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
