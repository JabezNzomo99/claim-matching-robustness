No, that's not true: the story was originally published in 2016 by a satirical website and went viral again in 2018 after it was reposted by a fauxtire website. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe story reappeared in an article published by 8Shit on July 4, 2018 titled \"Feminist Picnic Falls Apart After All Women Refused To Make The Sandwiches\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe picnic was supposed to celebrate the capabilities of women in a safe, women-only environment, but things didn't quite go as planned. With the sun hanging high in the sky it seemed to be perfect weather for a picnic. But the seven proud feminist friends were in for a big surprise when none of them brought any food at all. 'I brought a communal picnic hamper for us to all throw in the food we'd brought. I was expecting the usual picnic fare: sandwiches, crisps, a nice fruit salad, and so on - but no-one else brought a single thing. Not so much as a sausage. I was even more furious about my lot in life than usual. I ended up storming off and shame eating three Big Macs from the nearest McDonalds. I'm a vegetarian so it was particularly galling for me to have to do that,' said picnic organiser Rachel Queen.\n\nBut 8shit.net carries a disclaimer on its about page that reads:\n\nAnd an additional disclaimer in the footer of every page:\n\n8Shit is a satire news and humor website.
