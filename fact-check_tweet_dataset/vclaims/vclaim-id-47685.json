The country will start reopening on May 1.\n\nThe South African government instituted a three-week nationwide lockdown beginning on March 27 and later extended it through April 30 in response to the coronavirus outbreak, requiring civilians not to leave their homes except for reasons deemed essential.\n\nThe Facebook post alleges that Ramaphosa announced a significant extension to the lockdown, as well as specific measures concerning foreign nationals in the country.\n\n\u201cThe government of SOUTH AFRICA is going to add three months of Totally lockdown which will start on 21 June , And president is asking all foreigners to vacate so that the country can left with its only citizens who will be given free food , water , electricity and free rent,\u201d reads the post. \u201cAnd the president also add that if the foreigners fail to vacate the country they will face great consequences since they will face military soldiers who will be moving door to door to ensure that the country is left with its only citizens.\u201d\n\nThese claims are false, however. There is no evidence that Ramaphosa has asked foreign nationals to vacate the country. Nor that the lockdown is now set to last until June 21.

The country is set to begin gradually reopening May 1, according to Reuters.\n\nJackson Mthembu, the minister in the presidency, addressed similar rumors via Twitter on April 7.\n\n\u201cFAKENEWS ALERT !!!
