Jaclyn Schildkraut, associate professor at the State University of New York at Oswego and co-author of \u201cMass Shootings: Media, Myths, and Realities,\u201d said her review of Lott\u2019s report suggests he \u201cdrastically inflated the number of international shootings and minimized the context of the U.S. mass shootings picture.\u201d She said his count of 43 incidents in the United States was too low; her count for the same period, with a different definition for mass shooting, is 188. Lott said he used the same definition as indicated by Lankford in his report.\n\nLott's response: Three unidentified criminals armed with automatic weapons without warning started firing wildly on people in the Snezhinka cafe-bar. A news report says this was possibly a drunken quarrel but police do not exclude the \"response\" of the Russian population to the hostage-taking in Beslan, since the visitors of this cafe are mainly from the Caucasus. \u201cIf a drunk person uses a machine gun to randomly shoot up people (and the [Global Terrorism Database] says that this is neither terrorism nor insurgency or guerrilla related), it would appear to fit the type of case that you are still willing to include,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think that it is revenge for the Beslan school massacre where 385 people were shot to death and something over 500 more were wounded, I leave it to you whether you want to count it as terrorism.\u201d\n\nLott's response: \u201cWe have provided all the info that we had, including that the Philippines classified that as a terrorist attack, but our rule has been to rely on the University of Maryland GTD as the determining factor for whether it is a terrorist attack. Countries can have political reasons for classifying attacks in different ways, and rather than get into a debate on these issues we relied on the GTD. We spent a lot of time talking to the GTD, and they seemed to have good reasons for how they generally classified cases.\u201d\n\nWe appreciate Lott's willingness to recalculate his results based on our questions, as well as his decision to make public the voluminous data he has collected as he tried to replicate Lankford's findings. Lankford has chosen to keep his data set private, which makes it difficult to understand how the two researchers come to such different conclusions. Indeed, Lott was unaware that Lankford did not include the Mumbai attacks in his data set until The Fact Checker learned that from Lankford. (That's because Lankford refused to respond to his queries.) Lott's results changed when he removed cases that might not fit the public's definition of a mass shooting, just as they would change if a different definition of mass shooting is used.", "lang": "en"}
