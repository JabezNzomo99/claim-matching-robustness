Alt News has debunked several such claims in past weeks. A video is now viral on social media with the claim that in the light of the epidemic, China is allowing Muslims to read the Quran which was previously banned.\n\n\u201cThe Holy Quran was banned in China. Now the ban has been lifted. Chinese Muslims are allowed to read Holy Quran. Look at the Joy!!!!! ALLAHHUAKBAR,\u201d reads the viral text shared with the video. It is also getting shared with the same message in Hindi.\n\nAlt News has received multiple requests to fact-check this video on its official mobile application.\n\nAlt News broke the video into multiple key-frames with the help of digital verification tool InVid. According to an article published on March 19, 2013, by a website called \u2018Gospel Prime\u2018, the video depicts the moment when people saw the bible for the first time. Although, the article states that it is unclear where and when was the video made.\n\nThe video was later uploaded by a YouTube channel named International Christian Concern on March 17, 2014. Some reports also claimed that the video is from the 1980s.\n\nAlt News couldn\u2019t independently verify the video and its content. Suffice to say, it is unrelated to the recent outbreak of coronavirus since it has existed on the internet at least since 2013.", "lang": "en"}
