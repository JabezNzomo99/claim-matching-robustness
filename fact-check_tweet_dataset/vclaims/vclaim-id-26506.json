It was recently posted again \u2013 as spotted via tool CrowdTangle \u2013 by Facebook group President Rody Duterte-Federal Movement International on July 31. Sangkay Janjan TV\u2019s post has since been widely shared over 105,400 times with 63,000 reactions and 12,000 comments.\n\nThe facts: Palparan was found guilty over the kidnapping and serious illegal detention of two missing UP students Karen Empe\u00f1o and Sherlyn Cadapan in 2006. The Malolos Regional Trial Court (RTC) handed down the guilty verdict on September 17, 2018. (READ: People of the Philippines vs Jovito Palparan)\n\nThe testimony of several eyewitnesses strengthened the evidence to warrant the conviction of the retired general. Aside from Palparan, Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Anotado and S/Sgt Edgardo Osorio were also indicted by the court.\n\nOn June 26, 2006, Cadapan and Empe\u00f1o went missing in Hagonoy, Bulacan. During that time, they were UP students who were accused of being members of the Community Party of the Philippines (CPP).\n\nIn December 2011, the Department of Justice (DOJ) found probable cause to charge Palparan, Anotado, and Osario with kidnapping and serious illegal detention. The Malolos RTC ordered Palparan's arrest the same year. He went into hiding until he was arrested in Sta Mesa, Manila on August 12, 2014. (TIMELINE: The search for Jovito Palparan)\n\nThe page which claimed Palparan was innocent did not provide strong proof that the NPA, or the communists, were the ones who abducted the UP students.\n\nIn its \"About\" section, Facebook page Sangkay Janjan TV said that its posts are \"more on 'opinion' [since] we have freedom of speech in our country so I am free to express my own opinion here.\" Meanwhile, the Facebook page President Rody Duterte-Federal Movement International is under Rappler's watchlist of Facebook pages that spread false information on social media. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/ Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
