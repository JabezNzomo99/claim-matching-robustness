The report said that Warren had 10 times more Native American ancestry than the reference set from Utah, and 12 times more than the set from Britain. The report also said that the long segment on Chromosome 10 indicated that the DNA came from a relatively recent ancestor.\n\nThose are significant findings. But reporters focused on the language indicating a range of between the sixth to 10th generation. That raised the prospect of an ancestor amid hundreds of great-great-great-etc.-grandparents. The image below of eight generations (256 ancestors), via the UC Davis genetics lab, indicates how the generations quickly expand (red is for female and blue is for male). It shows an even distribution, with each successive ancestor contributing equally to the DNA of an individual.\n\nBut ancestors do not contribute genetic material equally over time. Here\u2019s the image of 11 generations of ancestors by genetic material they contributed to a particular individual. Some ancestors contribute a lot \u2014 while others nothing at all. In other words, as you go back in time, the number of your ancestors keeps increasing but not nearly as fast as the number of genealogical ancestors. Look closely at the sixth generation, and you will see some strong contributors of genetic material \u2014 and many weak ones.\n\nThe most important point is this: The results in Warren\u2019s DNA test are static. The percentage of Native American DNA in her genome does not shrink as you go back generations. There could be one individual in the sixth generation \u2014 living around the mid-1800s, which is similar to Warren family lore \u2014 or possibly a dozen or more ancestors back to the 10th generation, which would be about 250 years ago. Her results are consistent with a single ancestor, however.\n\nThis basic error in understanding the test results was compounded by the RNC\u2019s reference to the 2014 New York Times article, which was about a genetic profile of the United States, based on a study of 160,000 people drawn from the customer base of 23andMe, a consumer personal genetics company. With reporters believing that Warren\u2019s genome was only as little as 0.01 percent Native American*, the article\u2019s line that \u201cEuropean-Americans had genomes that were on average 98.6 percent European, .19 percent African, and .18 Native American\u201d made it appear as if Warren\u2019s sample was even smaller than that of the average American. (*Note: an earlier version of this article mistakenly referred to the high end of range, 1.56 percent.)\n\nIn fact, the 23andMe study used a different methodology, so it cannot be compared to the Bustamante report. Moreover, the reference to an average \u201cEuropean-American\u201d is misleading, because there are wide variations in the genetic makeup, with the vast majority of European Americans having no Native American ancestry. The small percentage of European Americans with more than two percent Native American ancestry are concentrated in a handful of states, such as North Dakota, New Mexico and Louisiana. But the majority of European Americans in the study have zero.\n\nKim TallBear, associate professor at the University of Alberta, said the \u201cvery desire to locate a claim to Native American identity in a DNA marker inherited from a long-ago ancestor is a settler-colonial racial understanding of what it is to be Native American.\u201d In an email, TallBear said that Native Americans' own definitions of legitimate Native American or tribal identity focus not on long-ago ancestors identified through a test but are based on a living community: \u201cclose social and biological relations of people one can name, indeed people one probably knows (huge LOL here) \u2014 one\u2019s family, community, and tribe.\u201d\n\nWe are not trying to defend Warren\u2019s decision to release the test, just to set the record straight about what the test shows. The media bungled the interpretation of the results \u2014 and then Warren\u2019s opponents used the uninformed reporting to undermine the test results even further. We fell into this trap as well, and were too quick to send out a tweet (now deleted) that made an inaccurate comparison. We should have not relied on media reporting before tweeting.", "lang": "en"}
