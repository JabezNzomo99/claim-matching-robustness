Those sharing this meme claimed that this term stood for either \u201c1 female 1 boy,\u201d or \u201c1 female 1 baby,\u201d and that cars were being tagged with these codes by sex traffickers. The meme received a viral boost when it was posted to actor James Woods\u2019 Twitter account:\n\nA very close friend of mine was out today doing shopping with her child at the Bricktown Walmart. When she left the store a lady stopped her and made her aware of what was written on her back window (1f1b) im just going to assume that it stands for 1 female 1 baby. She was then informed that this is now how sex traffickers are tagging cars.. please please mothers, fathers, grandparents.. aunts & uncles. Be AWARE! Feel free to share! Wont be tagging my friend for personal reasons.\n\nThe claims made in this viral social media post are unfounded.\n\nPolice in Bricktown, New Jersey, have said that they are unaware of any such activity. But before we get to the police statement about this matter, let\u2019s take a look at the game of telephone that helped this rumor go viral.\n\nThe text of this post states that this happened to a \u201cfriend of mine.\u201d When we read a little further, we see that this \u201cfriend\u201d was warned about this new criminal tactic by a random stranger. Not a police officer, a news reporter, or even a Walmart employee \u2014 just an anonymous \u201clady.\u201d The original post received a few thousand shares, but this post received far wider circulation. And the farther we moved away from the rumor\u2019s origins, the muddier the details got. One poster, for instance, informed people that this incident took place in Bricktown, Oklahoma City, despite the fact that there is no Walmart in this location.\n\nWhen we try to boil down this rumor to its origins, we see that the claim is based on something someone saw on Facebook, written by a person claiming that their friend had heard from a stranger that the code \u201c1f1b\u201d was being used by sex traffickers to flag future targets. In other words, this rumor doesn\u2019t exactly have credible origins.\n\nBrick Township Sgt. Jim Kelly said the department had not been notified. \u201cWe have no reports for anything like this,\u201d Kelly said. He also said the department has not been alerted by state or federal authorities of any information that indicates criminals are marking vehicles \u201cas a method for anything.\u201d It\u2019s simply another Facebook rumor without any facts, Kelly said.\n\nThis is not the first time that this type of baseless warning has gone viral on social media. In July 2019, for example, we wrote about the false claim that sex traffickers were flagging targets by placing zip ties on houses, mailboxes, or vehicles. In December of that year, a false rumor circulated that sex traffickers were laying down in front of vehicles in order to trick them into stopping. That same month saw the spread of another false rumor holding that roses were being placed on cars to mark potential targets.\n\nHuman trafficking is a real problem in the world, but the schemes described above are not based on any real-world threats. In fact, The Polaris Project, a non-profit that runs the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, writes that the forced kidnapping aspect of the aforementioned rumors is one of the most prevalent myths when it comes to trafficking:", "lang": "en"}
