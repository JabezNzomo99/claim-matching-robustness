The accompanying text said the picture had been taken \u201ctoday\u201d (26 May) and that it was his birthday.\n\nWe have seen other pictures posted on 26 May that show Mr Corbyn visited a cafe in Waltham Abbey that day too. He is wearing the same glasses, distinctive green t-shirt and orange gloves, and seems to be holding the same coffee cup.\n\nThe text accompanying the picture in question said the Facebook user had encountered Mr Corbyn at \u201cRomney Marsh Lock\u201d, which seems to be a misspelling of \u201cRammey Marsh Lock\u201d which is also where the cafe is.\n\nA photo posted on 26 May from Mr Corbyn\u2019s son\u2019s company\u2019s Twitter account also seems to show him wearing the same outfit.\n\nWe have asked Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office for comment.\n\nHow did they make this mistake?\n\nThe post we are checking claims the image was actually taken in 2016. Comments under the post show that some users used Google\u2019s Reverse Image Search tool to come to this conclusion.\n\nOne commenter has posted a screenshot from Google of the picture of Mr Corbyn accompanying a Daily Mail article from 2016. But on closer inspection, this article has nothing to do with Mr Corbyn, and is actually about a wildlife photographer called Iain Scott, and was published in November 2016.\n\nDoing a reverse image search on the photograph of Mr Corbyn is likely to have surfaced this article from 2016 as the 2020 image of Mr Corbyn may have appeared in the sidebar of the 2016 article\u2019s page (where the most recent articles are advertised).\n\nAlthough Google\u2019s Reverse Image Search can be a useful tool in identifying misinformation, it does not always tell the full story.", "lang": "en"}
