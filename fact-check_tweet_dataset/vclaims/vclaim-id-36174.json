This particular interview of Tiwari happened nearly a month ago, much before the exit poll. Tiwari, in this interview, got emotional about his humble upbringing.\n\nThe viral video shows that Tiwari was giving an interview to the TV9 news channel as one can see the channel logo on the mic held by the reporter.\n\nSearching on YouTube, we found the exact interview uploaded by TV9 Bharatvarsh on January 14, 2020. The caption of the interview says besides giving challenge to Kejriwal, listen why Manoj Tiwari became emotional in this exclusive interview given to TV9 correspondent Abhishek Upadhyay.\n\nWhen the correspondent asked Tiwari about his family and upbringing, the Delhi BJP chief broke into tears while giving details about his struggle in the early years.\n\nHence, it is clear that Manoj Tiwari cried on TV but it wasn't on the day of exit poll results. The viral video is nearly a month old.", "lang": "en"}
