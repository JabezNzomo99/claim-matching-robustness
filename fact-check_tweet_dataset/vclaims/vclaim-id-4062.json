She left \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Comedy Central in December.\n\n\n\nMichelle Wolf\u2019s jokes at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner have stirred up a lot of strong reactions. President Donald Trump called the comedian \u201cfilthy,\u201d while feminist icon Gloria Steinem called her \u201csmart, funny and daring.\u201d\n\nA host of opinion pieces expressing similar viewpoints have cropped up since the April 28 event. And writers of false stories are capitalizing on the controversy surrounding Wolf\u2019s performance.\n\nOne story has been circulating on Facebook with the headline, \u201cBREAKING: Michelle Wolf Fired \u2014 Comedy Central Apologizes To Sarah Sanders.\u201d\n\nSome Facebook users rightly flagged it as potentially false. It is.\n\nThe story originated on Daily World Update, a website that describes its content as satire. But other websites have copied it and presented it as news \u2014 without a disclaimer.\n\nThere are a couple of things that indicate the story is made up. First, it claims that the CEO of Comedy Central is someone named Art Tubolls, a fictitious character who was used in other stories on a related, now-defunct website as a \u201ccorrespondent,\u201d a \u201clegal analyst\u201d and a \u201cpublicist.\u201d But Comedy Central doesn\u2019t have a CEO. The TV channel is owned by Viacom, whose CEO is Robert Bakish.\n\nAlso, the story claims that Wolf was \u201cfired\u201d from her job at Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d But the show\u2019s host, Trevor Noah, included a segment in his April 30 show, panning Wolf\u2019s critics and explaining that she left the show in December to pursue her own series on Netflix.\n\nAccording to Netflix, \u201cThe Break with Michelle Wolf\u201d is due to start streaming online May 27.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah. \u201cMichelle Wolf\u2019s \u2018Disgraceful\u2019 Performance at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner.\u201d YouTube. 30 Apr 2018.\n\nNetflix. \u201cThe Break with Michelle Wolf Comes to Netflix on May 27.\u201d 11 Apr 2018.", "lang": "en"}
