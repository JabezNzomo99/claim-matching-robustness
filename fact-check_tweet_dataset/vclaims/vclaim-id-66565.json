But they found the state had no women in the U.S. House, U.S. Senate or in statewide elected office.\n\nOnly Louisiana rated lower than Georgia, with women making up 10.3 percent of its state Senate and 13.3 percent of the state House but holding no seats in Congress and no statewide offices.\n\nNew Hampshire is No. 1 for 2015, up from 42nd place in 2004, with three of its four congressional seats held by women. The state has a female governor, and women fill about one-third of the state\u2019s House and Senate seats, according to the institute.\n\nWe checked the institute\u2019s data against information on female legislators available at the website of the National Council of State Legislatures.\n\nThe NCSL reported 1,782 female legislators, nationally, and 53 in Georgia, numbers just slightly different, as of February, from the institute\u2019s totals. The NCSL pointed out that the data were subject to change due to resignations, appointments and special elections.\n\nThe National Women\u2019s Political Caucus reported the number of women serving in state legislatures in 2013 was 1,779, essentially what it is today.\n\nThe institute\u2019s report notes that women haven\u2019t made the gains in elected offices in recent years that they did in the past couple of decades. It points out that, in the six years from 2009 to 2015, the female members of Congress grew only minimally, from 16.8 percent to 19.4 percent.\n\nThere are various theories on why more women aren\u2019t officeholders. Some research suggests that women generally win elected office at similar rates as men but fewer women run for office.\n\nVeteran state Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, said politics is frequently a rough business and one where \"men assume they are qualified and ready to be elected or appointed, women are more hesitant to take the leap.\"\n\nBut when they are willing to serve and willing to compete for opportunities to lead, as well as just to be there, women can do really well, Oliver said.\n\n\"They can be a moderating influence. They are more collaborative and they can be better at identifying a variety of issues that affect real people, and that\u2019s true of both Democratic and Republican women,\" she said.\n\nState Rep. Debbie Buckner, a Democrat from Junction City, said she believes the House lost more than the normal number of female lawmakers after redistricting.\n\n\"Maybe it is \u2018Southern\u2019 manners or disdain for conflict, but there were some who chose not to run against their colleagues,\" said Buckner, who was first elected to the House in 2002.\n\nShe said it is difficult for a woman to serve in the Legislature when it means juggling family, job, campaigning, fundraising, constituent concerns and legislative duties that include preparing for committee meetings and floor debates.\n\n\"My first year of service my daughter was only six,\" Buckner said. \"I was asked repeatedly: \u2018Don't you worry about her? How can you leave her? Or how do how do you do this with such a young child at home?\u2019 \u2026 I have often wondered how many male legislators were asked any of those questions.\"\n\nBuckner said she believes \"intelligent and thoughtful women add much to the process.\"\n\n\"Their perspective is more broad and encompassing and many times more collaborative,\" she said.\n\nOur conclusion: A new report from the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research says Georgia is 49th among the 50 states for women serving in elected state and federal offices. It cites the state\u2019s all-male congressional delegation, its 77 percent-male Legislature and its lack of any women in statewide elected office. Other sources report similar data.\n\nWe rate the statement as True.", "lang": "en"}
