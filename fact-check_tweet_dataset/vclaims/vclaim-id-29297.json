These posts question that where were they when the Pulwama attacks happened and claiming that they are only concerned only when their religion is involved. Let\u2019s analyze the truth in their claims. The archived version of a post can be found here.\n\nClaim: Aligarh Muslim University held a candle march protesting against New Zealand shooting but not for Pulwama attacks. Fact: While it is true that Aligarh Muslim University held a candle march protesting against New Zealand shooting, a simple look at their twitter handle will indicate that they also did the same after the Pulwama attacks as well. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nAs per this article published by ANI, Aligarh Muslim University Students\u2019 Union (AMUSU) took out a candle march in the university campus to provide a tribute to the people who lost their lives in the Christchurch terror attack. A simple look at their twitter handle indicate that they did a similar candle march after the Pulwama attacks as well. A Google search also provides articles and videos which mention AMU condolences and deep sympathies with the families of killed CRPF personnel.\n\nFinally, Aligarh Muslim University held a candle march protesting against violence in both Chirstchurch shooting and Pulwama attacks. Hence the claim that they did not protest against Pulwama attacks is False.\n\nUpdate (18th March 2019): We spoke with Prof. M Shafey Kidwai from Public Relations Office of AMU who stated that the student union has carried out the candle march for Pulwama attacks on the same day and AMU administration condemning the Pulwama attack is also mentioned in their official website.", "lang": "en"}
