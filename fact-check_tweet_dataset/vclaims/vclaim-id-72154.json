If it is implemented, they say, local communities will be forced to cede authority to the federal government on issues such as affordable housing and land use, and individual property rights will be under threat.\n\nSupporters, including Governor Chafee and the planners and community leaders who drafted the plan, say it\u2019s a well crafted, comprehensive guide that will help move the state\u2019s economy forward over the decades ahead. They say there\u2019s nothing in the plan that would infringe on individual property rights or local home rule.\n\nThe debate grew so heated at one meeting a shouting match broke out, with charges of racism and bigotry hurled. And last week, at a meeting of the Statewide Planning Council, opponents called it unconstitutional, socialist and even treasonous. Nonetheless, the council voted unanimously to adopt it.\n\nMike Stenhouse, CEO of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, a conservative research group, has led the opposition. A few weeks ago, he talked about the plan on WPRO-AM\u2019s \"The Dan Yorke Show.\"\n\nYorke asked Stenhouse to cite a component of the plan \"that highlights what you think is problematic.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m going to give you my interpretation,\" Stenhouse responded. \"I don\u2019t have their plan in front of me. What we believe, for instance, take Poppasquash Point in Bristol. According to HUD, it is patently unfair and socially unjust that wealthy people can live in an exclusive neighborhood.\"\n\nWe wondered whether Stenhouse was right about HUD\u2019s view of wealthy neighborhoods such as Poppasquash Point, one of the state\u2019s priciest enclaves.\n\nWhen we asked Stenhouse about his statement, he told us he was not directly quoting HUD, but said that his statement was \"an accurate interpretation of HUD\u2019s openly stated intent.\" He provided links to multiple documents to support his position.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t view Stenhouse\u2019s statement as a direct quote of HUD policy, we do believe that listeners who heard Stenhouse\u2019s preface -- \"according to HUD\" -- would assume he was summarizing HUD\u2019s policy.\n\nStenhouse\u2019s backup is comprised primarily of links to a news story and an editorial in Investor\u2019s Business Daily and links to various legal documents and HUD regulations.\n\nThe Dec. 13, 2013 news story quoted an official from New York\u2019s Westchester County -- more on Westchester in a moment -- as saying that, in HUD\u2019s view, \"even quarter-acre (lot) single-family zoning \u2026may very well be discriminatory and perpetuate 'segregation.\"\n\nStenhouse characterized those comments as \"HUD\u2019s words,\" but they are actually the words of a HUD critic, not the agency itself.\n\nThe June 20, 2014 editorial criticized HUD\u2019s proposed \"Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing\" rule, characterizing it as a mechanism to force communities to change zoning laws to allow construction of \"subsidized and other affordable housing to bring more low-income minorities into `white suburbs.\u2019\"\n\nBut again, these are the words of a HUD critic, not the agency.\n\nThe other documents largely come from a long-running legal dispute in Westchester County.\n\nIn 2006, the Anti-Discrimination Center, a fair housing advocacy group, sued Westchester County in federal court, arguing the county had defrauded taxpayers by accepting $50 million in HUD grant money while failing to remove barriers to fair housing as required by law. A federal judge ruled in the group\u2019s favor.\n\nIn 2009, the county reached a landmark settlement agreeing to spend some $50 million to build or acquire 750 affordable-housing units, 630 in communities in which African Americans comprise less than 3 percent of the population and Hispanics make up less than 7 percent.\n\nThe conflict continues as Westchester County has yet to complete an analysis of local zoning and, thus, has lost more than $20 million in federal grants.\n\nStenhouse highlighted passages in the Westchester settlement agreement that show HUD seeking to enforce the Fair Housing Act by requiring wealthy communities, such as Bedford and Scarsdale, to take steps to increase housing availability for Hispanics, African Americans and low-income residents.\n\nThe act, adopted in 1968, prohibits discrimination by housing providers, such as landlords and real estate agencies, based on race, religion, sex, national origin, whether a family has children, or disability. Any community that accepts HUD funds must comply with the act.\n\nStenhouse also refers to the federal Community Development Block Grant program regulations and to HUD\u2019s proposed Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule.\n\nUnder the rule, communities that receive HUD grants would be required to certify that they\u2019ll work toward analyzing and removing barriers to fair housing.\n\nNone of the documents, however, show HUD targeting wealthy people or describing exclusive neighborhoods as \"unfair\" or \"unjust.\"\n\nAfter reviewing the documents Stenhouse provided, we came to two conclusions.\n\nFirst, it is clear that HUD and the federal government say it is illegal for communities to enact zoning and other ordinances that, in effect, exclude low-income, minority and other protected groups.\n\nSecond, HUD\u2019s policies relate to the planning and zoning actions of governing bodies, not the personal actions of individuals. We found nothing in the documents to support Stenhouse\u2019s claim.\n\nWe also reached out to national housing experts and academics specializing in housing law. Four got back to us. None agreed with Stenhouse\u2019s characterization of HUD\u2019s regulations.\n\n\"I\u2019ve never seen that language used by HUD or anyone at HUD,\" said Daniel Lauber, past president of the American Planning Association and of the American Institute of Certified Planners and current president of Planning/Communications, a national firm that assists communities with land-use issues.\n\nThe Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule and Community Development Block Grant regulations \"are all aimed at removing barriers to fair housing that artificially force segregation on us,\" Lauber said. Such obstacles include discriminatory real estate practices; zoning policies imposing large lot sizes; and artificially increasing the cost of housing.\n\n\"When they enter into these contracts to take HUD money, they know they are going to have to further fair housing.\"\n\nAccording to David Reiss, a professor of real estate and housing policy at Brooklyn Law School, \"HUD does not interpret the FHA [Fair Housing Act] to mean that `wealthy people\u2019 can\u2019t `live in an exclusive neighborhood.\u2019\"\n\n\"An exclusive neighborhood is an expensive one \u2013 the FHA does not ban expensive neighborhoods.\" Reiss continued in an email statement. \"What it does do is ban exclusionary practices. Exclusionary practices are those that exclude people based on certain of their characteristics such as their race, sex or religion. To my knowledge, HUD has never taken the position that merely living in an exclusive \u2013 that is, expensive -- neighborhood violates the FHA.\"\n\nWe also asked HUD whether Stenhouse had accurately characterized its rules.\n\n\"There are simply no policies, practices, regulations or anything that can validate such hyper hyperbole,\" Brian Sullivan, a public affairs officer with HUD, said in an email statement.\n\nMike Stenhouse said \"According to HUD, it is patently unfair and socially unjust that wealthy people can live in an exclusive neighborhood.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that HUD has challenged what it considers to be discriminatory practices at the community level, including exclusionary zoning ordinances.\n\nBut that\u2019s not nearly the same as objecting to the right of wealthy people to live in expensive neighborhoods.", "lang": "en"}
