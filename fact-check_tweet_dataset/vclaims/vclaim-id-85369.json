He was not talking about Meals on Wheels, but about a program in the Housing and Urban Development Department known as CDBG, or community development block grants.\n\nThere are some scattered municipalities that use some of their CDBG funds to help fund nutrition programs for the elderly. But most of the funding for Meals on Wheels comes from a separate program run out of the Health and Human Services Department, said Jenny Bertolette, vice president of communications at Meals on Wheels.\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed a 17.9 percent cut in funding for HHS, but it has provided no detail on whether that would also impact the Administration for Community Living, which funds nutrition programs for the elderly. Bertolette said it was fair to assume there would be an impact.\n\nAs for the CDBG, Bertolette said, \u201cThere\u2019s no nationwide breakdown of how these block grants are allocated within each state. Some programs will be hit hard and some might not be affected. It really depends on the state.\u201d She pointed to a provider in Ypsilanti, Mich., that she said faced a 30 percent cut in funding.\n\nAlison Foreman, the director of Ypsilanti Meals on Wheels, said while government funding made up about 30 percent of its funds, almost all of that came from the HHS program. But \u201clast year Washtenaw County Office of Community and Economic Development did issue pass-through dollars to YMOW for vehicle updates and staff support,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs you know, or I think you know, that Meals on Wheels is not a federal program. It\u2019s part of that community \u2014 the CDBG \u2014 the block grants that we give to the states. And then many states make the decision to use that money on Meals on Wheels. Here\u2019s what I can tell you about CDBGs because that\u2019s what we fund \u2014 right? \u2014 is that we spend $150 billion on those programs since the 1970s. The CDBGs have been identified as programs since I believe the first \u2014 actually, the second Bush administration as ones that were just not showing any results. We can\u2019t do that anymore. We can\u2019t spend money on programs just because they sound good. And Meals on Wheels sounds great \u2014 again, that\u2019s a state decision to fund that particular portion to. But to take the federal money and give it to the states and say, look, we want to give you money for programs that don\u2019t work \u2014 I can\u2019t defend that anymore. We cannot defend that anymore. We\u2019re $20 trillion in debt. We\u2019re going to spend money, we\u2019re going to spend a lot of money, but we\u2019re not going to spend it on programs that cannot show that they actually deliver the promises that we\u2019ve made to people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy understanding of Meals on Wheels is that that is a state determination. The federal government doesn\u2019t directly fund that; it funds the central Community Development Block Grants, the CDBGs. And some states choose to take the money and do Meals on Wheels. Other states and localities might choose to do something else with them. We look at the CDBGs. And when we do that, we look at this as $150 billion spent over 40 years, without the appreciable benefits to show for that type of taxpayer expenditure. And that\u2019s why we have the reduction.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear from the context that Mulvaney is referring to CBDG. Reason, a libertarian magazine, has written a number of reports that have criticized the program for waste and corruption. Mulvaney certainly could have taken the opportunity to explain that Meals on Wheels is mainly funded through HHS, but he did not do so. (A spreadsheet on the HUD website indicates that about one percent of CDBG funds goes to \u201csenior services\u201d and 0.17 percent goes to \u201cfood banks.\u201d No specific breakdown is given for Meals on Wheels.)\n\nLater in the briefing, Mulvaney was asked about after-school programs that might be cut. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to help kids who don\u2019t get fed at home get fed so they do better in school,\u201d he said. \u201cGuess what? There\u2019s no demonstrable evidence they\u2019re actually doing that. There\u2019s no demonstrable evidence of actually helping results, helping kids do better in school.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
