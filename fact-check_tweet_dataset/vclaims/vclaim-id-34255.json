No, that's not true: The claim that Speaker Pelosi offered a financial bribe for impeachment support was published as satire by a known and well-labeled satire website. Unfortunately, more than a few readers see the fake headline, believe it is real, and share the story. Also, other sites steal the photo and copy and republish it without the satire labeling. Lead Stories can confirm this is a fake story published by a liberal who trolls conservatives into sharing false stories.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by BustaTroll.org on November 20, 2019 titled \"Nancy Pelosi Approves $1 Millon Expense Accounts For Any Rep That Votes For Impeachment\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe satire includes this beyond-belief quote purportedly from Pelosi:\n\n\"Those voting to impeach the traitor in the White House will have the added benefit of taxpayer-funded expense account up to $1 million to help cover personal protection and party supplies to celebrate, as well as armored vehicles and full-time Secret Service protection. \"I hope you will come celebrate with me this weekend at Nicholas Cage's compound in Venice over margaritas and mimosas. We're gonna light up the town and drink until Trump quits!\"\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bustatroll.org as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
