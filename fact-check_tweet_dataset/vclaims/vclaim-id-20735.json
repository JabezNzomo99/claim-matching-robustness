No, that's not true: the fake quote came from a website that makes money by taking bits and pieces of real news and adding invented \"facts\" to the headline and first paragraph of their own version in order to drive traffic that earns them advertising money. She did not say this, the quote is not real.\n\nThe quote appeared in an article published by YourNewsWire on June 6, 2018 titled \"Melinda Gates: We Must Discriminate Against All White People\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nMelinda Gates has called on governments and corporations to start discriminating against white people in order to redress racial discrimination. The billionaire founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told Fortune magazine that she intends to begin sending money to people based purely on their sex and skin color, and encourages others to follow suit. \"It's been incredibly disappointing to watch how few women-led businesses are getting funded,\" Gates said. \"Ultimately, if we want more innovation and better products, we've got to put more money behind women and minorities. That wasn't happening, so I decided to step in and see what I could do to help a little bit.\"\n\nWhat she basically said was that she preferred investing money in companies and startups run by women or minorities. Whatever her motives may be for this, it is her own money and the fact that she chooses to invest it based on certain criteria does not mean she is calling on everyone to \"discriminate against all white people\". That's just misleading.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt.
