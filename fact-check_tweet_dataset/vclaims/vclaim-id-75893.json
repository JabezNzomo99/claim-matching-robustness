Okay? It was beyond heartbreaking and beyond infuriating.\"\n\nStevens' body was not dragged through the street, at least not in the way Ingraham suggests, multiple accounts and three official reviews make clear.\n\nand the facts remain the same.\n\nThe bottom line: Good Samaritans took Stevens to a hospital where he could receive medical treatment.\n\nThe most recent summary of the events came from the in January 2014. In an appendix, the report provides a timeline. It has this entry for 1 a.m. Sept. 12, 2012:\n\n\"Local Libyans found the Ambassador at the Mission Facility and brought him to a local hospital. Despite attempts to revive him, Ambassador Stevens had no heartbeat and had perished from smoke inhalation.\"\n\nTwo other government bodies said much the same thing. An , headed by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering, declared that Stevens was brought to the hospital by six civilians. \"To the best knowledge of the Board these were \u2018good Samaritans\u2019 among the hordes of looters and bystanders,\" the review concluded.\n\nThe -- controlled by Republicans -- reported that \"local Libyans found the remains of Ambassador Stevens in the main diplomatic building at the Benghazi Mission and transported him to the hospital. The Libyans apparently did not realize who the Ambassador was, but they alerted the State Department of his location by using the cell phone that was in the Ambassador\u2019s pocket. Libyan doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate Ambassador Stevens upon his arrival at the hospital.\"\n\nThe Associated Press interviewed the Libyan doctor who treated Stevens. CNN spoke to Libyans who said they had found Stevens. The CNN report includes amateur video that shows rescuers pulling Stevens through a window.\n\nIt seems established fact that Libyans brought Stevens directly to the hospital and there were no signs that anything else took place.\n\nIngraham said that the body of Ambassador Stevens was dragged through the street. We reached out to Ingraham but did not hear back.\n\nAfter reading three government reports and independent press accounts, we find that Stevens, overcome by smoke from the fire, was brought to a Libyan hospital where efforts to revive him failed. To be dragged through the streets implies disrespect. There are no reports of public abuse of his body.\n\nThis claim was debunked long ago and the truth has been widely available. We rate Ingraham's claim False.", "lang": "en"}
