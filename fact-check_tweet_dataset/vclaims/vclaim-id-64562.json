Mukesh Goyal, another BJP leader, was given the ticket instead, which led to supporters of Hansraj protesting by burning effigies of some prominent BJP leaders and the party flag.\n\nFurther, The Quint reached out to a local reporter in Kotputli, who confirmed that in the run-up to the incident, there had been rumours of Hansraj having been given the ticket for Kotputli, leading to celebration amongst his supporters.\n\nHowever, the next day, when it came to light that the ticket had actually gone to Goyal, his supporters staged this protest. Post this incident, Hansraj reportedly filed his nomination as an independent candidate.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that a two-year-old unrelated incident is being shared on social media now without the correct context.", "lang": "en"}
