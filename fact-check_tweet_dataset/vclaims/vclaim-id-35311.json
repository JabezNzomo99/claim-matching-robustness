Till mid-80s it was sold by Govt. Because of Rajiv Gandhi and western Pharma companies it got bad name,\u201d he wrote, ending his tweet with the following appeal: \u201cMake cannabis legal.\u201d\n\nA few other also claimed that cannabis kills coronavirus after Agnihotri\u2019s tweet.\n\nA simple reverse-image search revealed that the screenshot shared by Agnihotri does not correspond to a news broadcast but is a meme. It was created on the website en.dopl3r.com.\n\nThe website gives users the option to select a meme temple, a category and add images and text.\n\nAlt News Science editor Dr Sumaiya Sheikh weighed in on the claim that cannabis, commonly termed as \u2018weed\u2019 has antibiotic properties: \u201cThere is some ongoing research with natural fibre hemp plants (cannabis plant) to have cannabinoids that show some anti-bacterial activity. The research is ongoing for various biomedical applications. However, unlike bacteria which is a single-celled pathogen, viruses are even smaller pathogens that can have bacteria or other live cells such as human, animal and plant cells for growth and reproduction. There is no evidence that cannabis (hemp plants) can have any effect on coronavirus infections.\u201d\n\nHence, not only did Vivek Agnihotri share a meme as \u2018news\u2019, but he also circulated potentially dangerous misinformation that cannabis can kill coronavirus.
