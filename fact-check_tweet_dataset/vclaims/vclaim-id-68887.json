But the legislation, signed into law by Democratic President Barack Obama, remains deeply unpopular among Republicans, and some state governments \u2014 including North Carolina\u2019s \u2014 are refusing to expand Medicaid coverage.\n\nIn North Carolina, a bill to expand Medicaid through a program called \"Carolina Cares\" was authored by Republicans but doesn\u2019t have enough support to pass in the GOP-controlled legislature. So on June 26, a member of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s cabinet urged Republican legislators to follow in the footsteps of another prominent conservative: Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nMandy Cohen, secretary of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, told the crowd at a \"Close the Gap Advocacy Day\" event that Pence approved Medicaid expansion while governor of Indiana.\n\n\"When (the Vice President) was Governor of Indiana, he expanded Medicaid,\" Cohen said, according to this tweet by the executive director of NC AIDS Action.\n\nCohen\u2019s comments came in the waning days of the N.C. General Assembly session, when legislators could have taken up the Medicaid expansion bill but didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen PolitiFact contacted Cohen\u2019s office, spokesman Cobey Culton referenced the websitefor Indiana\u2019s health care program to support her claim.\n\nThe ACA, also known as Obamacare, allowed states to expand Medicaid programs to adults earning 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2015 was about $2,743 a month for a family of four. And it encouraged states to expand coverage by offering to pay for a large majority of the cost.\n\nUnder standard Medicaid, the federal government offers states a cost-match ranging from 50 to 73 percent.\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government paid 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs between 2014 and 2016. It then dropped its support to 95 percent in 2017 and plans to cut its support to 90 percent by 2020.\n\nIn 2015, then-Indiana Gov. Pence reached an agreement with the Obama administration to expand Medicaid under a custom program known as the \"new Healthy Indiana Plan.\"\n\nThe words \"Medicaid\" and \"expansion\" rarely appear together on Indiana\u2019s health care website. The state describes the program as a \"homegrown consumer-driven health care coverage program for low-income adults.\" And, upon announcing the news, Pence avoided praising Medicaid as an effective coverage option.\n\n\"I believe Medicaid is not a program we should expand. It's a program that we should reform \u2014 and that's exactly what we're accomplishing,\" Pence said during a speech at an Indiana hospital. \"HIP 2.0 is not intended to be a long-term entitlement program. It's intended to be a safety net that aligns incentives with human aspirations.\"\n\nBut expand Medicaid, Indiana did. And, by the time Trump and Pence were elected to the White House, Pence was one of 10 Republican governors to expand Medicaid.\n\n\"Indiana and Arkansas have different names for their programs, but they are accessing federal funds through the ACA Medicaid expansion legislation,\" said Robin Rudowitz, associate director for the program on Medicaid for the Kaiser Family Foundation. KFF is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that focuses on health care issues.\n\nAs a result, about 381,000 people were enrolled in Indiana\u2019s program by 2016, according to the State Health Reform Assistance Network.\n\nSome conservatives oppose the idea of expanding Medicaid mainly because they fear the government might shift more of the financial burden to state governments over time. (Despite expanding Medicaid in Indiana, Pence wants to repeal the ACA and has falselyclaimed that expansion made it harder for disabled Ohioans to obtain coverage.)\n\nIndiana\u2019s expansion plan gained support from Republicans in part because the Hoosier state implemented controversial qualification requirements. For example, all participants in Indiana\u2019s program must contribute money \u2014 from $1 to $27 per month \u2014 to a health savings account. Enrollees who miss payments face a reduction in benefits.\n\n\"In Indiana\u2019s case their waiver contained elements like some increased cost sharing and health savings accounts \u2014 other states that have expanded Medicaid have used some of these ideas too,\" said Adam Searing, an associate professor at Georgetown University\u2019s school of public policy.\n\nAt the time, Indiana was the 28th state to expand Medicaid and one of the first to require premium payments. Since then, that list of states has grown to 33, and Utah is putting the issue to a vote via a statewide referendum this November.\n\n\"While Indiana\u2019s expansion doesn\u2019t look exactly like say California\u2019s or New York\u2019s where they just expanded coverage under their existing Medicaid program to the new group of adults, it does look a lot like Arkansas or Kentucky or Arizona or Montana which all used such waivers when they expanded Medicaid,\" Searing wrote in an email.\n\nThe latest Medicaid expansion proposal in North Carolina (Carolina Cares) is modeled after Indiana's program. It would charge premiums and impose work requirements.\n\nCritics worried that Indiana\u2019s rules would hinder its ability to cover more people. A recent study found that insurance coverage increased in states that expanded Medicaid \u2014 including Indiana.\n\nAaron E. Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University\u2019s School of Medicine and a critic of Indiana\u2019s payment requirements, summarized the findings in a July 2 article for The New York Times.\n\n\"The good news is that even with these extra requirements, Indiana saw significant gains in Medicaid coverage,\" Carroll wrote.\n\n\"But we don\u2019t know if gains would have been even larger without them,\" he continued. \"It\u2019s possible that the churn caused by cost-sharing requirements may be causing the state to underperform. Neighboring states did see larger gains than Indiana itself. But Indiana overperformed compared with other, more distant states, making this unclear.\"\n\nCohen said Indiana expanded Medicaid while Pence was governor. Though Indiana doesn\u2019t refer to its program as Medicaid expansion, the state did expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act while implementing controversial conditions.
