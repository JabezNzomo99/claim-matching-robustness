Read more about our partnership with Facebook.\n\nWe reached out to Hodges through his website to learn the source behind his statement. We didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nWe searched the Nexis database of news reports and did not find anything that backed up this claim, but it\u2019s possible that he\u2019s conflated a couple of speeches from the pope.\n\nPope Francis spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations in September 2015. There, he called for a world free of nuclear weapons, and an end to \"violence against ethnic and religious minorities.\"\n\nSpeaking of the Middle East and Africa, he decried the situations where innocent people \"have been forced to witness the destruction of their places of worship, their cultural and religious heritage, their houses and property, and have faced the alternative either of fleeing or of paying for their adhesion to good and to peace by their own lives, or by enslavement.\"\n\nIn that speech, Francis spoke of \"the negative effects of military and political interventions which are not coordinated between members of the international community.\"\n\nIf that\u2019s the source of Hodges\u2019 statement, it doesn\u2019t match what he described. There\u2019s no call for universal collection of guns, nor did he specify that the United Nations would be the only group that can coordinate military interventions.\n\nIn fact, when the pope visited Central African Republic, his call for peace between warring Christian and Muslim factions acknowledged there is an appropriate role for arms.\n\n\"To all those who unjustly use weapons in this world, I appeal: Put down your weapons of death; arm yourselves instead with justice, love, mercy and authentic guarantees of peace,\" he said August 2015.\n\nPope Francis opposed the unjust use of weapons, meaning in his eyes, there can be a just use of weapons.\n\nIn his 2015 speech to the U.S. Congress, Francis also called for an end to the international arms trade.\n\nHodges might have also reworked fake news that twisted remarks the pope made three years ago in Turin, Italy, in 2015, when he was at a rally of thousands of young people.\n\nThe pope was talking about war, trust and politics. And he singled out the weapons industry.\n\n\"People, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons, that leads to a bit of distrust, doesn\u2019t it?\" he said, as reported by Reuters.\n\nIn the minds of some, that translated into the pope saying that gun owners can\u2019t be Christians.\n\nWe rated that interpretation Pants on Fire.\n\nAn online program said Pope Francis had called for worldwide gun confiscation, except for the United Nations.\n\nThe pope has not said those words or called for such a change. The most generous reading is that this is based on interpretations of remarks the Pope has made about regional and ethnic conflicts.\n\nIn keeping with Christian doctrine, one would expect the pope to speak against violence. What is striking is even with that, the pope said that there can be just uses of weapons.\n\nWe shoot down another bit of fake news and rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
