This claim is false; this video has circulated since at least 2016 in media reports about Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to a mosque in northwest China.\n\nThe one-minute video was published here on Facebook on February 3, 2020. It has been viewed more than 250 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe logo of Chinese state media CCTV can be seen in the top-right corner of the video.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cChina PM who told we\u2019ll translate the Quran as our own realised that the only one way to protect from the korona virus is doing \u2018sajtha\u2019 to Allah and went to mosque to pray, Masha llah.\u201d\n\n\u201cSajtha\u201d, also romanized sajda, is an Arabic word meaning prostration to God, a posture often adopted during prayer.\n\n\u201cMashallah\u201d is also an Arabic word meaning \u201cGod willing\u201d, most commonly used to express joy.\n\n\u201cKorona virus\u201d, or novel coronavirus, is an epidemic that has killed at least 630 people and infected some 30,000 others in China since its emergence at a wildlife market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, according to this AFP report dated February 7, 2020.\n\nThe current Chinese prime minister is Li Keqiang. Here is his biography at the Chinese government\u2019s website.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than 17,000 times after it was shared here, here, here on Facebook; here and here on Twitter; here and here on YouTube, alongside similar claims.\n\nHowever, the claims are false; this video shows Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to a mosque in northwest China in July 2016.\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes extracted from the video found this footage, published on the official YouTube channel of Chinese news agency CCTV, on July 20, 2016.\n\nThe video description reads, in part: \u201cChinese President Xi Jinping paid a special visit to the Xincheng Mosque in Yinchuan City Tuesday morning, during his current fact-finding tour of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China.\u201d\n\nBelow are screenshot comparisons of the misleading Facebook video (L) and the CCTV video (R):\n\nPresident Xi\u2019s visit to the mosque in July 2016 was also reported by local and international media here and here.", "lang": "en"}
