Epstein, a financier, was awaiting trial in the fall of 2019 when authorities say he committed suicide in a jail cell.\n\nJeffrey Epstein\u2019s confidant Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested in New Hampshire on Thursday morning on multiple sex abuse charges including conspiracy to entice minors to engage in sexual acts. Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend and accused madam was taken into custody at 8:30 a.m. in Bradford, N.H., the FBI confirmed to Fox News. She had purportedly been hiding out in Paris, France before her arrest. Maxwell, the daughter of late British media magnate Robert Maxwell, has been accused in civil court filings of facilitating a sex-trafficking operation that brought girls \u2014 some as young as 14 \u2014 to Epstein\u2019s Manhattan home, though until Thursday she had not been formally charged with any criminal wrongdoing.\n\nShortly after the news broke, social media platforms were flooded with videos and photographs that supposedly showed U.S. President Donald Trump and Maxwell together.

Epstein, too, had a number of a high profile acquaintances, including both Trump and former President Bill Clinton.\n\nIt should also be noted that all of the following photographs were taken prior to Maxwell\u2019s arrest in July 2020, and before authorities first started investigating Epstein for sexual crimes against minors in 2005.\n\nAll of these images of Maxwell with Trump are real.\n\nThe image on the top left is still from NBC\u2019s archival footage shown above.
