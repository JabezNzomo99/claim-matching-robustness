The photographs are actually an old stock image of ID cards and a picture of evidence in a fraud case; neither has any links to foreign workers.\n\nThe post, which was published on Facebook on February 24, 2019 and has been shared scores of times, contains two photographs and text that translates as: \u201cE-KTP for foreign workers from China\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe presence of Chinese nationals working in Indonesia is sometimes used against president Joko Widodo by his political opponents. Here is a report in the Jakarta Post on this issue.\n\nA Google reverse image search found the photographs do not show ID cards that have been issued to Chinese workers.\n\nThe first image is a stock photo from local media group Merdeka.com.\n\nIt has been used as an illustration for multiple articles on Indonesia\u2019s electronic ID cards, for example, this April 16, 2012 report and this December 8, 2018 story. Neither of the reports mentions Indonesia giving ID cards to Chinese workers.\n\nThe second photo used in the misleading post was taken from this report by Indonesian state news agency Antara dated June 10, 2011.\n\nThe report is headlined \u201cBRI: Online system reveals credit card fraudsters\u2019 documents\u201d, referring to Indonesian state lender Bank Rakyat Indonesia.\n\nThe photo\u2019s translated caption reads: \u201cThe evidence in an important document forgery case is shown at the Surabaya City Police headquarters, June 9. The Surabaya City Police\u2019s criminal investigation unit has uncovered a syndicate that created fake documents used by alleged fake credit card applicants in Bank Rakyat Indonesia. The case has caused billions of rupiah in losses for BRI.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
