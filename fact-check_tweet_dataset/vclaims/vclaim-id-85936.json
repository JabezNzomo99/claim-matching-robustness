That\u2019s because Congress did not merely lift the debt ceiling to a new height but actually eliminated it until March 16, 2015. That little wrinkle has received little media attention so let\u2019s take a closer look. (Why is there a debt limit in the first place? Read our history lesson.)\n\nGenerally, Congress has lifted the debt ceiling to cap the amount the Treasury Department can borrow, but twice in the last year, it opted to briefly \u201csuspend\u201d the debt ceiling and then automatically increased the limit to the level of debt outstanding when the suspension expired. Now, in the bill that passed Congress last week, the debt ceiling is suspended for a full year.\n\nBoccia acknowledged that that two-thirds of federal spending stems from laws that Congress passed years ago, establishing such programs as Medicare and Social Security, and thus more or less operates on autopilot. Any change in that spending, in other words, would require a new law passed by Congress. Only about one-third of federal spending is what is known as discretionary spending\u2014money subject to annual appropriations. But she said the debt limit is \u201ca decisive, action-forcing moment for Congress to take charge of the automatic spending increases that are driving the U.S. spending and debt crisis.\u201d\n\nBoccia\u2019s commentary was mostly focused on Congress but Mike Gonzalez, spokesman for Heritage, defended DeMint\u2019s phrasing that this was a blank check for Obama. \u201cCongress has now removed the one leverage it had to stop the President from happily borrowing excessive amounts,\u201d he said. \u201cIf President Obama succeeds in pushing an agenda that expands federal spending through Congress, there is no limit on borrowing to discourage it.\u201d\n\nEd Lorenzen, a congressional budget expert who is senior adviser to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, said that lifting or suspending the debt ceiling accomplishes essentially the same thing\u2014restricting the issuance of debt for a finite period of time. \u201cSuspending the debt limit for a specified period of time does provide somewhat more certainty about the amount of time when Treasury\u2019s authority to issue debt will expire, but it does not give any greater ability to issue debt than an increase in the dollar amount,\u201d he said. \u201cIn both cases, Treasury is only able to issue debt necessary to meet existing obligations already in law.\u201d\n\nLorenzen noted that section 3 of the bill explicitly limited the suspension to debt issued to meet obligations in law that must be paid during the suspension period (\u201csuch obligation was necessary to fund a commitment incurred pursuant to law by the Federal Government that required payment before March 16, 2015\u201d) and prohibited the issuance of debt to increase cash balances in excess of normal operating balances.\n\n\u201cIf the country experienced a recession this year during which revenues fell sharply and welfare payments rose steeply, the Treasury could borrow hundreds of billions more with no debt limit through March 15, 2015,\u201d Woltornist said. \u201cBy point of contrast, if the Treasury didn\u2019t have a blank check to borrow, then the department would have to appeal to Congress for additional borrowing authority once the debt limit was reached. As it is with the suspension, regardless of how much borrowing occurs between now and March 15, 2015, the Treasury will not run out of borrowing authority but will simply fill in the dollar amount on its blank check on March 16, 2015.\u201d\n\nBut Stan Collender, another longtime budget analyst, predicts that the suspension will demonstrate that the debt ceiling is not necessary to control federal spending. Restraints on government spending are \u201caccomplished with other statutes like the Budget Control Act that put in place caps on appropriations, and with authorizations that govern each mandatory program,\u201d he wrote on his blog. \u201cThe debt ceiling only allows the government to borrow to make good on the spending and revenue laws that are already on the books. Not being able to borrow more in no way eliminates the government\u2019s legal obligation to spend and tax.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, perhaps DeMint was simply making a rhetorical point, though one that was highly partisan. (He faulted Democrats for handing out a \u201cblank check\u201d to Obama, but one could also argue that the Democrats acted to prevent a default on the national debt that would have alarmed the markets.)\n\nBut in the federal budget, it takes two to tango. The Treasury is only authorized to pay bills that Congress has approved, and thus it is a stretch to claim that Obama has been handed a \u201cblank check.\u201d Suspending the debt limit for a defined period of time, as opposed to setting the debt limit at the defined level, does not change that balance of power. While Woltornist is correct that a recession or some other economic crisis would automatically boost spending, without Congress being forced to immediately deal with the debt ceiling, such spending would merely be the result of laws that Congress previously passed. In any case, the time limit in the law means Congress would be forced to confront the issue again.", "lang": "en"}
