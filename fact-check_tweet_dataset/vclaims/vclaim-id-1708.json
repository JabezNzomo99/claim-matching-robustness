On average they spent about 40% less per head than London councils.\n\nNot all spending by the government comes via councils, and if we look at government spending overall the difference seems about half as stark. People outside London received about 14% less public spending per head than Londoners overall.\n\nThe comparison only covers \u2018identifiable expenditure\u2019\u2014money that\u2019s obviously set to benefit a particular region.\n\nSome public spending can\u2019t be split up between different regions (defence spending is often used as an example) and other spending is a bit ambiguous.\n\nFor example, in the past we\u2019ve looked into statistics on transport infrastructure spending and found they\u2019re pretty imperfect. It\u2019s not always clear what public money is earmarked for which regions, or how well this reflects the different needs of different areas.\n\nFinally, there will be a difference between how much councils spend and how much they get from the central government. It\u2019s possible that those outside London might get relatively more in grants but have less capacity to raise revenue locally. We\u2019ll look into this in more detail.", "lang": "en"}
