Our Father, Who Art in Heaven\u2026.\u201d\n\nReuters could not find any record of Pelosi saying this. A declaration of this kind by the speaker of the House would have been widely reported on by news organizations.\n\nDrew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff confirmed to Reuters via email that this claim is false.\n\nIn an August 23 CNN interview, when Pelosi is asked if she will accept the election results as legitimate if Trump is re-elected, she said:\n\n\u201cOf course.

It doesn't mean that we ignore the Russian interference into our election, and they try to cloak it by saying, 'Well, we look at many countries.'\u201d ( here )\n\nFalse. Speaker Pelosi did not say she will resign if President Trump is re-elected.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact-checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
