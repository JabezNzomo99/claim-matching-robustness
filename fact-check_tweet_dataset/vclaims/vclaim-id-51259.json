Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar have vowed to take benefits like Social Security and Medicare away from senior citizens.\n\nThe Daily Caller found no evidence Ocasio-Cortez or Omar ever called for such action. The claim actually comes from an article published on a satire website.\n\nOcasio-Cortez and Omar have become popular targets for fake news since their respective elections to Congress in 2018. This particular meme purports that the freshman congresswomen have promised to take benefits away from senior citizens.

Such a vow does not appear on either of their Twitter accounts or ProPublica\u2019s archive of their deleted tweets. The congressional record has no account of either proposing the cuts either.\n\nIn fact, both congresswomen have actually called for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a single-payer, government-run health insurance program that would cover all Americans. Ocasio-Cortez also recently released a video calling for the House to vote on a bill that would expand Social Security benefits.\n\nThe claim may originate with a satirical article published on Daily World Update, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d\n\nThough Daily World Update has a disclaimer noting that it\u2019s a satire website, the meme shared on Facebook not only fails to issue a similar warning, it deceptively insists that the claim is real.", "lang": "en"}
