Why are you living in our country and loving other countries? I don\u2019t mind you not liking me but I don\u2019t think you should live in our country and like other things. Get your priorities right.\u201d\n\nThe video instead of promoting the app landed Kohli in a soup after fans criticised his reaction and also pointed out how he supports many international players across sports.\n\nThe parody account @imVlkohli created on November 3, 2018 was quickly racing towards gaining 2000 followers with just 32 tweets, at the time of writing this story.\n\nThe real Virat Kohli is followed by a whopping 27.1 million followers on Twitter.\n\nWhile the fake account was earlier trolling the cricketer for frequently brand-name dropping, it changed tact after Kohli's recent comments.\n\nOn November 7, the fake account tweeted that it was discontinuing endorsing foreign brands and would only endorse Indian brands from now on.\n\nThe tweet received over 1700 likes and was retweeted more than 600 times. Many Twitter users believed it to be true with many hailing the decision and even suggesting Indian brands that Kohli could promote.\n\nOn Diwali, the parody account once again tweeted using a photo of Kohli with actor and wife Anushka Sharma.\n\nSome of the replies to the tweet are below.\n\nThe real Twitter account of the cricketer is @imVkohli while the fake account has an extra 'l' in the handle @imVlkohli. While the real account has a blue tick given only to verified accounts, the fake one does not.\n\nAdditionally, the bio of the real account reads, \"The Official twitter account of Virat Kohli, Indian cricketer, gamer, car lover, loves soccer and an enthusiast.\"\n\nThe fake account states it is a parody account and says, \"Indian cricketer who loves Brand Promotions & hates DRS. Parody\"", "lang": "en"}
