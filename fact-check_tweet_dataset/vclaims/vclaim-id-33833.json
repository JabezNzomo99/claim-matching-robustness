The claim is false; the video actually shows a stunt staged by a Brazilian influencer with his friends in Brazil.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on July 16, 2019. It has been viewed more than eight million times and shared more than 140,000 times.\n\nThe 33-second video shows an airborne drone launching fireworks at a narrow street, while onlookers duck for cover.\n\nThe post's caption states: \u201cWhoah! Guy Gets Annoyed At His Neighbor's Loud Party, Attacks It With A Fireworks Drone\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video was also published here, here and here on Facebook, here, here and here on Twitter, and here and here on YouTube alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video shows a stunt designed by Brazilian influencer Lucas Albert with his friends in Brazil.\n\nA keyword search found that Albert, who has more than two million followers on Instagram, published the same video to the social networking site here on July 14, 2019. The post is embedded below.\n\nThe Portuguese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cMy friends had a barbecue on the street and didn\u2019t invite me, look what I did to them lol Trolled them out of nowhere. Next week there\u2019s \u2018guerra dos bruxos???\"\n\nThe video has since been shared widely in a misleading context, prompting Albert to issue a clarification on Twitter and Instagram Stories.\n\nTranslated from Portuguese to English, his tweet reads: \u201cThey took my video trolling my friends, threw it on a sensationalist newspaper website saying that it was a neighbor angry with the noise in Sao Paulo that fired bombs lol Dude, how far can these fake news go?\u201d\n\nAlbert made a similar statement in an Instagram Story, which was included in this July 15 news report by Brazilian newspaper Jornal de Brasilia.\n\nThis video was also debunked by AFP Brazil here.", "lang": "en"}
