The said press conference was held shortly after Patnaik announced that he would be contesting the Odisha polls from a second seat as well, that of Bijepur, apart from his home turf of Hinjili. According to the doctored letter, the \u2018State Intelligence Branch\u2019 (SIB), after carrying out a review of some Assembly constituencies, had recommended that Patnaik not contest from Hinjili owing to a variety of reasons. The letter even went on to provide a list of viable options that the CM should rather contest from.\n\nNews organisations picked the letter after the conference and ran stories assuming it was real, while some people on Twitter tweeted about the letter, questioning Patnaik\u2019s decision and saying it was playing safe or cowardice.
