The headline of the report read \u2018Rohingya refugees at Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh\u2019.\n\nAt the end of the article, the photo credit was given to a Bangladeshi photographer, Mobarak Hossain.\n\nWe found the original picture on his Facebook account published on September 10, 2017.\n\nThe team at NewsMobile has also reached out to Hossain to get a confirmation about the authenticity of the picture. The reply is awaited and we shall update the article post that.\n\nHowever, our investigation definitely proves that the picture is old and is not related to the ongoing economic crisis due to COVID-19 in India.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
