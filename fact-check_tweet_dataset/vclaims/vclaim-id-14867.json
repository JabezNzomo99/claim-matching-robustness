(1 liter = 0.264 gallon.)\n\nThe actual dynamics of retail gasoline prices in Russia are difficult to identify accurately, based on Russian sources due to discrepancies between the numbers reported by state agencies and those reported by independent sources. For instance, the most recent report by Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) shows a 1.7 percent to 2.1 percent spike in prices varying across Russia\u2019s 63 regions between December 2018 and January 2019.\n\nGazeta.ru, citing independent analyses, reported that the median increase of retail gasoline prices for the same period was 11 percent.\n\nNotably, the Rosstat graph reflecting the dynamics of gasoline prices between January 2017 and January 2019 shows a 110 percent median increase for \u0410i-92 gasoline, which corresponds with U.S. \u201cRegular\u201d grade gasoline.\n\n\u200bAccording to a research by FinExpertiza, a Russian network of professional auditors and business consultants, the increase of gasoline prices across Russia by the end of 2018 was between \u201cmore than 5 per cent\u201d in three regions \u2013 the highest in the country \u2013 and 0.7 percent in one region \u2013 the lowest in the country.\n\nNina Kozlova, CEO of FinExpertiza concluded the increase in gasoline prices \u201coutpaced inflation in Russia by an average 2.89 times, and in some regions more than 25 times.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIf these trends continue, gasoline prices may serve as the main driver of inflation growth in the current year.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info gives Putin\u2019s claim a false verdict, since his numbers are considerably lower compared to these reported by every other source in Russia.\n\nYet, even with the increase in prices, Russia still ranks ninth in the Bloomberg\u2019s rating of the countries with cheapest retail prices for gasoline.", "lang": "en"}
