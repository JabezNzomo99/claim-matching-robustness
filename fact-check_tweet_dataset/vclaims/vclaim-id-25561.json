Kadyrov complained the only reason he was on international sanctions lists was his advocacy for the rights of Muslims, and \u201cnothing else.\u201d\n\nThe United States imposed financial and travel sanctions against Ramzan Kadyrov on December 20, 2017 \u201cfor being responsible for extrajudicial killing, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the head of the Chechen Republic, Kadyrov oversees an administration involved in disappearances and extra-judicial killings. One of Kadyrov\u2019s political opponents was believed to have been murdered at Kadyrov\u2019s direction after making allegations of torture and ill-treatment taking place in Chechnya, including alleged torture carried out by Kadyrov personally,\u201d the U.S. Treasury said.\n\nThe European Union sanctioned Kadyrov in July 2014 for \u201cpublicly supporting violations of Ukrainian sovereignty\u201d through his support for Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean peninsula.\n\nWhile Kadyrov has not explained how he is \u201cdefending the rights of Muslims,\u201d his aspirations of being perceived as the leader and protector of Muslims in Russia has long been documented, prompting criticism from both experts and many Islamic clerics.\n\nThe two most widely reported instances when Ramzan Kadyrov spoke on behalf of the Russian Ummah (Islamic community) were when condemning the French magazine Charlie Hebdo\u2019s publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammed and more recently, the treatment of Myanmar\u2019s Muslim Rohingya minority. On both occasions Kadyrov organized mass protests in Chechnya \u201cthat might foster perceptions of him as the protector of oppressed Muslims,\u201d RFE/RL Caucasus expert Liz Fuller wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile Kadyrov enjoys posing as the defender of oppressed Sunni Muslims worldwide, his chances of being formally recognized as such, let alone ever being empowered to act in that capacity, are minimal, because many prominent and respected Muslim theologians consider him a heretic, even though they may not necessarily say so publicly,\u201d Fuller concluded.\n\nKadyrov\u2019s claim of being blacklisted by the West for his protection of the rights of the Muslims is therefore not credible, while his record of human rights atrocities is decades-long and well-documented.\n\nKadyrov stands accused of committing human rights atrocities \u201cso widespread and systematic, that they constitute crimes against humanity,\u201d said a 2006 report from the New York-based NGO Human Rights Watch.\n\nApart from the long list of atrocities, including forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture in secret prisons, gay purges, intimidation, and public humiliation, Kadyrov\u2019s name is affiliated with numerous political assassinations \u2013 including journalist Anna Politkovskaya, human rights activist Natalia Estemirova, and opposition leader Boris Nemtsov.\n\nIn September 2017, a Swedish-based Islamic NGO, \u201cChechen Charitable Association Veyfond\u201d posted a video statement on YouTube accusing Kadyrov of ordering the kidnapping a family of five, including women and children, followed by the kidnapping of two young women \u2013 all within two weeks. Vayfond said Kadyrov-orchestrated mass protests for Muslim rights were \u201chypocrisy\u201d, calling the Chechen strongman \u201cthe murderer of Muslims.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
