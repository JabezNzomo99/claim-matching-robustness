The Portuguese soccer player's management company told AFP the story was false, \"like many other stories about Ronaldo\".\n\nIdentical headlines in various online publications make the same claim, stating that the alleged donation was intended to feed Palestinians for Iftar, the meal eaten after sunset during Ramadan.\n\nAFP first found the false information on May 7 in an Arabic-language Facebook post shared 7,000 times. Social media posts in Spanish and French shared it further.\n\nOn May 16, Venezuelan television channel Telesur picked up the story in an article on its English website, referring to a tweet from \"Onwadan\u2019s Charity Foundation\", which presents itself as a charity organisation in Lagos, Nigeria, on its Facebook page.\n\nThat tweet didn't fit the narrative of the text as it included a picture of children holding a banner reading \"Orphans in Syria. Thank You Cristiano Ronaldo.\" That picture was already tweeted in 2016 by Syria Charity, a humanitarian group.\n\nThe next day, the English website of Russian television channel RT picked up the false story in an article shared 17,000 times. They later corrected the story but RT\u2019s original headline still appeared in Google search results for \"Ronaldo donates $1.5 million\" on May 27, and the hoax remained uncorrected on many other news websites, such as here and here.\n\nThe hoax gained further traction on social media platforms, for example here and here, as people quoted the original sources of the hoax.\n\nIt is not the first time Cristiano Ronaldo has been subject to rumors related to Palestinians.\n\nAn altered photo of the Portuguese player holding an \u201cAll with Palestine\u201d (\u201cTodos con Palestina) sign has been circulating on the internet since 2012, as found in a search on Tineye reverse search.\n\nAn AFP picture from 2011 shows the original picture in which Real Madrid players hold a sign reading \u201cAll with Lorca\u201d(\u201cTodos con Lorca\u201d), referring to the Lorca earthquake, which killed nine people that same year.\n\nRonaldo is not the only soccer player to fall victim to false stories online.\n\nIn June 2018, false remarks regarding the cancelation of a friendly game between Argentina and Israel were attributed to Ronaldo\u2019s Argentinian rival Lionel Messi.", "lang": "en"}
