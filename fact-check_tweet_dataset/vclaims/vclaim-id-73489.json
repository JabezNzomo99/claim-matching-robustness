According to Fateh, the video shows Pakistani's uprooting trees in order to better the practice of \"killing infidel kaafirs\".\n\nPakistani citizens uprooted trees as part of their religious practice. The claim is false. The incident in the video is true and recent but there is an unnecessary communal angle being assigned to it. A keyword search was done on Google which led to news reports on the incident.\n\nAccording to a report by The International News, on April 9, the residents of the Mandi Kas area uprooted plants which were planted during the plantation campaign of a Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province) lawmaker.\n\nImmediately after Members of the National Assembly Iqbal Afridi's campaign which was part of the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami initiative being commemorated on Tiger Force Day concluded, the local people arrived at the site to remove the newly-planted trees. According to one of the men, the plantation drive had been \"forcefully\" carried out \"on private land\" of citizens. MNA Afridi confirmed later that the plantation had indeed occurred on private property. \"The locals were angry over the unauthorised tree plantation campaign,\" the lawmaker was quoted as saying. \"We're trying to have negotiations with them,\" he added. According to the official one of the groups gave permission for the plantation drive, while the other uprooted them.\n\n Other reports on the incident can be accessed here, here and here. Pakistan PM Imran Khan on April 9 had attended a ceremony which was the biggest tree plantation drive undertaken by the government and aimed at planting 3.5 million saplings across the country in a day. Thus the video getting viral doesn't have anything to do with the claims it is being shared.
