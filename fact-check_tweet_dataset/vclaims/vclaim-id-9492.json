Daily Feed News describes itself as a \u201csatirical publication,\u201d and says in a disclaimer: \u201cWe present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop other websites \u2014 like libertyinfo.net and anews-24.com \u2014 from posting the same story as though it were real news, regardless of the fact that its claims can\u2019t be substantiated.\n\nFor example, the story says that the city council in San Juan held an emergency meeting on Oct. 12 to \u201cinitiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.\u201d But no such meeting was noted on the council\u2019s calendar, and nothing was scheduled for Oct. 16, when the proceedings were alleged to start.\n\nThere wouldn\u2019t even be a need for a meeting of the city council, since, according to the law that governs how Puerto Rico\u2019s 78 municipalities operate, anyone can file charges to remove a mayor from office with the Commission to Air Municipal Complaints, a state agency.\n\nThe story, which was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, also falsely says that the U.S. isn\u2019t required to provide Puerto Rico with disaster relief.\n\nPuerto Rico has been a U.S. commonwealth since its constitution was approved in 1952, and people born there have been U.S. citizens since President Woodrow Wilson signed the Jones-Shafroth Act in 1917.\n\nPlus, the Stafford Act, which regulates the administration of disaster relief, treats Puerto Rico \u2014 along with the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands \u2014 the same as the 50 U.S. states.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nAutonomous Municipalities Act of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 30 Aug 1991.\n\nJoint Resolution approving the the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
