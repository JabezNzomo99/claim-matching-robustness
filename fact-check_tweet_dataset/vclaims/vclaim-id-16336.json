How can Michigan \u2014 which is still dealing with the fallout of its own mismanagement of its watershed \u2014 consider giving even more water to a foreign corporation with an annual profit in the billions? The answer from Michigan\u2019s government is 20 jobs. Yes, that\u2019s right \u2014 20 jobs in return for over 100 million gallons a year of nearly free groundwater.\n\nThe petition cited two articles: A Michigan Live piece published on 3 November 2016 and an article by the Guardian from 5 November 2016, which reported:\n\nMichigan regulators were deluged with angry comments this week, after reports that the state had drafted a permit approval for Nestl\u00e9 to nearly double the amount of groundwater it pumps from a plant in Evart, Michigan to 210m gallons a year. The pumping increase is only expected to cost the Swiss food giant $200 a year, and possibly the price of a permit fee, because its bottling plant in Evart is considered a private well under state law, regulators said. In a statement, Nestl\u00e9 touted the move as a boon to the state because it is created \u201csome 20 new jobs\u201d. The company is valued at $219bn.\n\nThat article mentioned Flint as a problem that paralleled Evart\u2019s, not one that was directly related. Regardless of what happened in Evart, Flint residents still remained without clean and safe drinking water, a circumstance that is close by, but unrelated to the Evart plant\u2019s activities:\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 plant at Evart is just 120 miles from Flint, where a recent move by public officials to save money by switching water sources caused lead to contaminate the city\u2019s water. Flint\u2019s water is still not safe to drink without a filter and health have officials said bacterial illnesses are on the rise because residents fear bathing. Flint\u2019s mayor is still lobbying Congress for cash to fix the city\u2019s pipes \u2026 The lawyer who represented plaintiffs in that case, Jim Olson, criticized regulators for not giving the public more notice of the new proposal. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an erosion of public notices and more internal official decisions,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThat\u2019s at the heart of the Flint water crisis, and now we have the same kind of institutionalized expediency here.\u201d\n\nAs of 22 November 2016, no decision had formally been reached:\n\nMichigan Citizens for Water Conservation sued Nestl\u00e9 in 2001 over the potential damage to lakes, rivers and streams that its bottled water plant\u2019s groundwater withdrawals would cause. After years of court battles, the two sides reached a settlement agreement in 2009, reducing Nestl\u00e9\u2019s siphoning to 218 gallons per minute from 400, with additional restrictions on spring and summer withdrawals. The litigation cost the nonprofit more than $1 million, which was covered by supporters. Now, the proposed permit from the DEQ would take the bottled-water plant\u2019s groundwater withdrawals back up to the level that prompted the lawsuit, though the suit involved four other, Nestl\u00e9-owned wells nearby in Mecosta County, where water withdrawals remain at 218 gallons per minute on average.\n\nSumofUs\u2019s petition implied that Nestl\u00e9\u2019s proposed increase was a done deal, when in actuality the public comment period remained open well after the petition appeared. The inclusion of Flint\u2019s ongoing water crisis was also misleading, as the problems in Flint cannot be resolved by approving or denying plans to expand the Evart plant.\n\nPrevious efforts by SumofUs included petitions claiming developers planned to put a mall in the Grand Canyon and that Starbucks colluded with Monsanto to sue Vermont over labeling of genetically modified organisms.", "lang": "en"}
