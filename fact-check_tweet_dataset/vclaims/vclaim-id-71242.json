PolitiFact deemed Trump\u2019s insistence that he got the call \"almost completely wrong\" the most significant falsehood of 2019.\n\nWe compared the whistleblower complaint with the White House memorandum of the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, and the House impeachment report.\n\nHere are the excerpts from the whistleblower\u2019s filing, followed by whether the information is confirmed.\n\nThis was confirmed by the memorandum of the call.\n\nSetting aside the characterization of the purpose as \"personal interests,\" the allocation of the number of words between pleasantries and a request for help with investigations accurately reflects the memorandum.\n\nThe complaint then describes what Trump wanted Ukraine to do.\n\nConfirmed, according to the memorandum that quotes Trump as saying the following: \"The other thing. There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.\"\n\nConfirmed, according to the memorandum.\n\nTrump is quoted as saying: \"I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you\u2019re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\"As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\"\n\nConfirmed, according to the memorandum: Zelensky is the first to bring up Giuliani\u2019s name. As for what Trump said, he did mention both men several times and in tandem.\n\nTrump: \"Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what\u2019s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.\"\n\nTrump: \"I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people.\"\n\nTrump: \"I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous. Trump made no reference to Lutsenko by name. What he said was, \"I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that\u2019s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.\"\n\nTrump might have been thinking of the previous prosecutor general Viktor Shokin; that would fit more with a prosecutor who had been \"shut down.\" The current prosecutor at the time, however, was Lutsenko. From the memorandum, which indicates that certain sections were left out and doesn\u2019t name the prosecutor, we can\u2019t tell for sure.\n\nThe memorandum shows that only the DNC server and the Bidens came up.\n\nHe was told wrong. Brechbuhl wasn\u2019t on the call. His boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was.\n\nTrump said that the intelligence community inspector general passed along a \"terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report.\" In reality, the complaint got nearly every detail correct, as the memorandum released by the White House and the impeachment inquiry showed.\n\nIt was correct on the request that Ukraine investigate the Bidens and the notion that Ukraine might have the DNC server that was hacked by the Russians in the 2016 election.\n\nIt was correct that Trump aimed to connect the Ukrainians with Giluiani and Barr, even down to the detail of Trump mentioning the two in conjunction.\n\nThe complaint described Trump as attempting to pressure Ukraine. In the impeachment inquiry, Democrats concluded that was correct, and most Republicans said it was wrong. But the key details the whistleblower offered to back that up were correct.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
