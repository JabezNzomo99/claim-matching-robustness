The data refers to NHS trusts closing at least one of their maternity units\u2014but some trusts have more than one maternity unit. Also, not all trusts provided information on their closures, and the closures reported were temporary.\n\nData obtained by the Labour party found that just under a third (41) of all NHS trusts in England had to temporarily close at least one of their maternity units at some point in 2017. A further third (48) of trusts didn\u2019t close their maternity units during 2017, and the final third (46) didn\u2019t respond to Labour\u2019s request.\n\nWe can\u2019t say whether a similar proportion of the trusts that didn\u2019t respond would also have closed units during 2017 or not. Labour told us it couldn\u2019t provide us with the data it collected.\n\nTrusts can have more than one maternity unit\n\nThe number of NHS trusts doesn\u2019t directly equate to the number of maternity units. NHS trusts sometimes manage more than one maternity unit\u2014for example Barts Health NHS Trust in East London runs five maternity units. So the fact that half of trusts closed at least one unit temporarily doesn\u2019t mean that half of all units closed.\n\nSaying that the units had to \u201cclose their doors\u201d could also suggest that they have closed permanently, when in fact the closures were temporary. The majority of trusts that did close units closed them for less than 24 hours. According to Labour, eight units shut for longer than 24 hours.\n\nThe Royal College of Midwives said it supported decisions by midwife managers to shut maternity units when the \u201clevels of staffing are not safe\u201d.\n\nLooking at the issue more widely, it said that NHS England is short of around 3,500 full-time midwives. We\u2019ve got more on this here.\n\nIn a study of maternity units published last year the Institute for Fiscal Studies also concluded that \u201cClosures are not necessarily bad for women, given the resource constraints that [maternity units] face on the day of closure. It may be safer for the affected women to travel elsewhere or wait at home until the unit reopens.\u201d It found the most common reasons for closures were a lack of capacity, such as staff or beds.", "lang": "en"}
