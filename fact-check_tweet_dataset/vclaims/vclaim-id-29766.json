The sports news site ESPN reported that Garrett was set to meet on Dec. 31 with team owner Jerry Jones and Jones\u2019 son, Stephen, who is the Cowboys\u2019 executive vice president.\n\nOn Jan. 5, 2020, the team made it official with an article on the Dallas Cowboys website reporting that the team opted to part ways with Garrett:\n\nTeam owner/general manager Jerry Jones confirmed the news in an official statement. \u201cWe are extremely grateful to Jason Garrett for his more than 20 years of service to the Dallas Cowboys as a player, assistant coach and head coach,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHis level of commitment, character and dedication to this organization has been outstanding at every stage of his career.\u201d The news gives some clarity to a story that has gotten quite confusing since the Cowboys were eliminated from the postseason last weekend. Following that win against Washington, Jones declined to comment on Garrett\u2019s future, stating he had no timetable for a decision.\n\nAccording to a press release issued by the NFL on Jan. 6, 2020, the Cowboys are expected to hire former Green Bay Packers Coach Mike McCarthy.", "lang": "en"}
