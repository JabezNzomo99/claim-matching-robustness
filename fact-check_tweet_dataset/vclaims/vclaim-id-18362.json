It was during that May visit that Trump first visited with the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office, whose officers responded to the shooting.\n\nShe met with them again last Monday, including Sheriff Tony Spurlock, who shared a picture of the visit on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThrilled to visit with Ivanka Trump again during her visit to Colorado,\u201d tweeted Spurlock. \u201cThankful for her support for law enforcement!\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post uses a photoshopped version of this picture to cast Trump in an anti-semitic light. \u201cWTF is she wearing?\u201d reads the caption. \u201cIt is like the Trumps are making it normal to be a NAZI.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ivanka converted to Judaism in 2009, the same year that she married her husband Jared Kushner. The couple and their children observe the Sabbath and keep kosher, she told Vogue in an interview.\n\nThe logo in the manipulated image likely comes from a political art poster created by Mark Fox and Angie Wang of graphic design company Design is Play. Their \u201cTrump 24K Gold-Plated\u201d poster features four rotated gold T\u2019s to form a swastika. According to the description, it reveals the \u201cmetaphoric negative spaces created by [President] Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
