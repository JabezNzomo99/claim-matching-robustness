The violence broke out after members of far-right Danish party Stram Kurs burned a copy of Quran on August 28, 2020.\n\nThe viral post shows two men holding a flag by its edges while another man sets fire to it.\n\nA caption with the post reads 'Last year #Muslim #refugees in Switzerland demanded removal of Cross from the SwissFlag. How thankless a community can be to a country which has given them rufuge on their homeland?' #Sweden #swedenriots #swedenburning. (Sic)'.\n\nThe picture is viral from several Facebook pages with similar claims.

An article published in The Independent on 13 February, 2008 carries the same image crediting it to stock image site Getty and wire agency AFP.\n\nThe caption with the photo reads 'A Danish flag is burnt at protests in 2006 ( AFP/Getty )'.\n\nBOOM then looked for the image on the website of Getty and found the same image dated February 23, 2006.\n\nThe caption with the image reads 'Karachi, PAKISTAN: Pakistani Muslims torch a Danish flag during a demonstration in Karachi, 23 February 2006. Pakistani hardline Islamic parties continued country wide protests denouncing the publication of cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed in several European newspapers. Five people died last week during anti-cartoon protests in Lahore and Peshawar that targeted Western businesses. AFP PHOTO/Rizwan TABASSUM (Photo credit should read RIZWAN TABASSUM/AFP via Getty Images)'.\n\nThe caption with the image makes it clear that the incident was reported in Karachi, Pakistan and was not demanding the removal of the cross from Switzerland's flag.\n\n\n\nCartoons of Prophet Mohammed were published in Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in September of 2005. In January 2006, these cartoons were reprinted by a Norwegian newspaper. On February 1, 2006 newspapers across France, Germany, Italy and Spain reprinted the cartoons. This led to worldwide protests by Muslims.\n\nRead more about the issue here and here.\n\nBOOM also compared the flags of Denmark and Switzerland which are visibly different.
