It has been shared with text that says: \u201cMexican official being dragged by the caravan. Anyone up for open borders??\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not true. The photo doesn\u2019t show migrants who are currently traveling north from Central America. It shows protestors during a clash with police in 2014. That demonstration had followed the disappearance, and suspected massacre, of 43 students in the Mexican city of Iguala. The clash with police in the photo happened in Acapulco.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that an old photo has been paired with misinformation about the so-called \u201ccaravan.\u201d Earlier we wrote about three old photos \u2014 one showed a bloodied officer from 2012; one showed an officer with a bloody nose from 2011; one showed an officer kneeling during another demonstration about the missing student teachers in 2014. Those three unrelated photos were circulating with this bogus claim: \u201cMexican police are being brutalized by members of this caravan as they attempt to FORCE their way into Mexico \u2013 And WE are supposed to believe these are just poor, helpless refugees seeking asylum???\u201d\n\nAlthough the photos have been shared thousands of times on Facebook, they have nothing to do with the group of migrants who are currently in the news.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nTuckman, Jo. \u201cMexican police injured in Acapulco during protests over student massacre.\u201d The Guardian. 10 Nov 2014.", "lang": "en"}
