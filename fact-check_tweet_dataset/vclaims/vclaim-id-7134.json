NATO made it clear it was aware of the Russian media reports.\n\nImmediately prior to the Russian media reports, a journalist from Canada\u2019s CTV National News tweeted that the Canadian armed forces denied the report on the alleged incident issued the previous evening by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. \"The Ministry of National Defense and the Canadian Armed Forces state that no Canadian person was injured or killed,\" the CTV journalist wrote.\n\nStopFake.org, a fact-checking service fighting disinformation about Ukraine, says that the DNR\u2019s statement is not supported by any evidence.\n\nAfter checking the claim with the Ukrainian military\u2019s press office, StopFake reported that one Ukrainian soldier was critically wounded and died in fighting on May 12. On May 11 and 13, Ukraine did not report any casualties in the fighting in the occupied Donbas regions, StopFake said.\n\nThe fact that the source of the false information was the DNR website was addressed by freelance journalist Nicholas von Twickel, who covers events in Ukraine.\n\n\u200bVon Twickel also noted that Canada has been a target of information warfare, and he drew attention to the fact that the DNR website distributed the false information in English, as well as in Russian.\n\nStevenson described the process in her Tweet, too.\n\n\u201cThe false claim Canadian troops had been killed in Ukraine today came from right off this website, then onto Russian language twitter now English accounts tweeting it,\u201d wrote Mercedes Stevenson. \u201cInteresting study in how #inforwars work.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
