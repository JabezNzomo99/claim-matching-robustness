Affected with the COVID 19. They are shipping it to Africa. So we need to be Aware.\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the photo is false. The picture has been available on the Internet for at least seven years. It has nothing to do with coronavirus.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the post by \"Thee Talkingbook\" was shared more than 1,500 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nUsing reverse image search, we found that a Facebook user \"Brech\u00f3 OLD CHIC\" posted this image in August 2013. This clearly proves that the viral picture is years old and it can't be related to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe picture has been in use for many years on various e-commerce websites with the title 'Used Clothes', for export purposes. The picture is mostly used on trading websites to export second-hand clothes to various countries.\n\nChina has almost recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. Reports say China's Wuhan, where the pandemic began, has no more Covid-19 patients in its hospitals. Restrictions are also being gradually eased out.\n\nChina reported almost 83,000 cases of coronavirus infections, with more than 4,600 deaths and nearly 77,500 recoveries.\n\nAfrica, on the other hand, fared much better compared to other continents in controlling the spread of Covid-19. Till late on April 27, the whole continent reported below 34,000 cases, with less than 1,500 deaths and more than 10,000 recoveries.\n\nIndia Today Fact Check is part of IFCN Alliance on Covid-19.", "lang": "en"}
