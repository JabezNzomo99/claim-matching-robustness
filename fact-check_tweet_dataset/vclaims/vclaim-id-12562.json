He has asked successive Ukrainian governments to return that facility to him.\n\nZhirinovsky, however, accused the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv of hypocrisy for condemning the \u201csham elections\u201d in \u201cthe pseudo-republics Russia created in eastern Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Europeans and Americans always evoke democracy and elections and free speech but do the exact opposite,\u201d Zhirinovsky said, before going off on a tangent about Americans probably \u201closing their mind\u201d amid a spate of mass shootings.\n\nThe position of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine is that the elections in eastern Ukraine are internationally illegitimate, \u201care not in line with either the Minsk agreements or Ukrainian law\u201d, and are ultimately \u201ca charade since the Kremlin has already anointed leaders to serve as its proxies in the so-called \u2018DPR\u2019 and \u2018LPR\u2019\u201d \u2013 the Russian-backed self-proclaimed \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDuring his appearance on Solovyov\u2019s program, launched into one of his trademark \u201chistory\u201d lessons, declaring: \u201cUkrainians in the Polish Army in 1612 already seized Moscow. Can you imagine? Of course it was a big government, a commonwealth, with Poles and Lithuanians, there could have been people who weren\u2019t Poles, and those who would later call themselves Ukrainians, but in 1612 the word \u2018Ukraine\u2019 was not heard anywhere.\u201d\n\nRussian nationalists have long sought to deny the existence of an independent Ukrainian people or language.\n\nFor example, in 1863, a secret decree issued by the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire, which essentially banned the printing of the Ukrainian language, said that \u201cno separate Little Russian [Ukrainian] language ever existed, doesn\u2019t exist, and couldn\u2019t exist.\u201d In effect, the document claimed the Ukrainian language was nothing more than Russian corrupted by Polish influence.\n\nYana Prymachenko, a senior researcher at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine\u2019s Institute of History of Ukraine, told Polygraph.info that Russian nationalists do not believe that Ukraine could exist as an independent state, adding that Putin himself called Ukraine an artificial state.\n\nSpeaking at the Selgier Youth Forum in 2014, Putin said: \u201cThere are historians here, and people with their own views on our country\u2019s history might argue with me, but I think that the Russian and Ukrainian peoples are practically one single people, no matter what others might say.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Putin reiterated that point: \"Friends, we in Russia always saw the Russians and Ukrainians as a single people. I still think this way now,\u201d he said at a concert in Moscow marking the one year anniversary of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.\n\nAnd at a 2008 NATO Summit in Paris he allegedly told then-U.S.President George Bush: \u201cUkraine is not even a state. What is Ukraine? Part of its territories are in Eastern Europe, but the greater part is a gift from us.\"\n\nZhirinovsky himself has called Ukraine an \u201cartificial state cobbled together by the Bolsheviks.\u201d\n\nBut the historical record paints a different picture. The word Ukraina (Ukraine) first appears in the Hypatian Codex, a compilation of three primary historical chronicles, in 1187. According to the Encyclopedia of Ukraine, \u201cthe terms Ukrainiany appears in the chronicle under the year 1268.\u201d\n\n\u201cUkrainnyky, and even narod ukrainskyi (the Ukrainian people) were used sporadically before Ukraintsi attained currency under the influence of the writings of Ukrainian activists in Russian-ruled Ukraine in the 19th century,\u201d according to the encyclopedia.\n\nAs noted by Prymachenko, the 1652 Guillaume de Beauplan map presents the territory included within modern day Ukraine as \u201cUkraina.\u201d That map roughly corresponds with the creation of the first modern Ukrainian state (the Cossack Hetmanate).\n\nDenying the existence of a historical Ukraine does not provide a legal pretext for Moscow\u2019s current military incursion into eastern Ukraine or its 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nWhile Zhirinovsky might be correct that the term Ukrainian itself was not in wide use in 1612, that has no bearing on the existence of a Ukrainian people then or on the rights of Ukrainian people today.\n\nPolygraph.info, therefore, finds his statement to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
