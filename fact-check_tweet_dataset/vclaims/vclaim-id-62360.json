The claim is false; on June 25, 2020, Facebook said no accounts will be automatically deleted for posting criticism on Aung San Suu Kyi's profile; as of June 29, there has been no official announcement from the social media company of the purported policy.\n\nThe claim was published on a news website here on April 3, 2020. The article was then shared thousands of times on Facebook here and here.\n\nThe article\u2019s Burmese title translates to English as: \u201cMark Zuckerberg will have an account auto-remove system if there is any harassment on Aung San Suu Kyi account.\u201d\n\nThe article also reads, in part: \u201cFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a statement, at 8 pm US standard time yesterday, that an automatic deleting system will be introduced for nasty and rude comments under Aung San Suu Kyi's Facebook profile.\u201d\n\nThe article circulated online just days after Aung San Suu Kyi opened a Facebook account on April 1, 2020. Suu Kyi said the profile was created to increase communication with the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that we are automatically deleting accounts that are critical of Myanmar\u2019s State Counsellor,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told AFP by email on June 25, 2020.\n\nThe spokesperson added that content would only be removed if it was deemed to be in violation of Facebook\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cOur Community Standards are clear about where we stand on issues like hate speech and bullying - we do not allow it on the platform. Other violations include people who misrepresent their identity or who impersonate others. The consequences for violating our policies vary depending on the severity of the violation and a person\u2019s history on our platform,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAs of June 29, a search on Facebook\u2019s online newsroom also found no announcement about the purported policy.", "lang": "en"}
