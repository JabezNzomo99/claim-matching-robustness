The post suggests this is a conflict of interest.\n\nHe did not personally receive that money. In 2008, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was awarded grant funding of over $46.4 million (about \u00a323 million at the time) by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and $12.7 million (about \u00a36.3 million) from other partners for research into treatment and prevention of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe largest portion of that funding went to the ACT Consortium, a body of research institutions around the world that conducted research into treatment for malaria and of which the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was a member. The ACT Consortium received around $40 million (around \u00a320 million) of the funding.\n\nAt the time, Professor Whitty was a director and Principal Investigator of the ACT Consortium, but the money did not go directly to Professor Whitty. According to reports from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the money went via the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\n\nMany universities, hospitals and research institutions receive grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
