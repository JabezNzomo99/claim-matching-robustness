For one, are coal exports up? What makes the coal clean? And most important, Trump claims \u201cthings are changing\u201d in states such as West Virginia, suggesting that those changes are a result of his administration\u2019s policies, but is that the case? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nBut in 2017, coal exports soared. In the first quarter of 2017, coal exports were 58 percent higher than in the same quarter of 2016, according to preliminary data from the EIA. The exports are expected to slow as the year progresses, but the EIA\u2019s 2017 forecast of 72 million short tons is 19 percent higher than 2016 levels.\n\nThe United States exports both thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity, and metallurgical coal, which is used to produce steel. And over the past year, U.S. exports of both types of coal have increased. But China primarily imports metallurgical coal from the United States. In 2017, more than 920,000 of the million short tons imported were metallurgical coal.\n\nThe distinction matters. The term \u201cclean coal\u201d refers to coal used for energy production. But the term is a confusion of concepts. When coal is burned to generate electricity, it releases a slew of noxious chemicals into the air, including sulfur dioxide, mercury and other heavy metals. Burning coal also releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. The \u201cclean\u201d part of the coal refers to electricity-generating plants that \u201cscrub\u201d sulfur dioxide from smokestacks and bury carbon dioxide emissions underground.\n\nThe term was first popularized by the coal industry in 2008, after the Environmental Protection Agency asserted that carbon emissions were subject to regulations under the Clean Air Act. The coal burned is not cleaner, but the plant uses technology to reduce the effects of burning the fossil fuel. Yet Trump has made a habit of calling coal \u201cclean.\u201d We\u2019ve called him out on the term in a previous column, but the correction didn\u2019t seem to stick.\n\nMetallurgical coal, in contrast, is not combusted. Instead it is carbonized and turned into coke, which is used to manufacture steel. In the process, most of the carbon is maintained in the coking coal. So Trump\u2019s claim that the United States is exporting more \u201cclean coal\u201d to China doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nStill, it is clear from the data that coal exports to China are on the rise. In China, domestic production of coal has declined just as demand for the resource has increased, according to a report on the commodity from the Reserve Bank of Australia. Investments in property and infrastructure have underpinned the demand for steel products within China. As a result, the price of coal, and coking coal in particular, has sharply increased.\n\nIn 2014, the value of coal exports to China from West Virginia ranked 13th out of the top 15 in the state, according to the Bureau of Business and Economic Research in West Virginia. And in 2015 and 2016, the bureau reported \u201cessentially no coal\u201d exports to China, causing a 90 percent contraction in exports from the state. (A report on the state\u2019s economic outlook by West Virginia University said the increase in coal production in the state was due to a surge in demand for metallurgical coal from the Asia-Pacific region as well as a temporary boost in demand from Australia after Cyclone Debbie damaged the country\u2019s rail infrastructure, but it did not specify China.)\n\nThe bureau estimates that the state will continue to see a modest decline in its overall share of U.S. coal exports as new construction along the Gulf Coast and in the state of Washington support the expansion of coal shipments to Asia and Europe from the Powder River basin in Montana and Wyoming and the Illinois basin in Illinois.\n\nTrump claims West Virginia is exporting \u201cclean coal\u201d to China. But this is wrong for two reasons. One, in 2015 and 2016, West Virginia exported virtually no coal to China. Two, there is no such thing as \u201cclean coal.\u201d Electricity-generating plants can mitigate some of the effects of burning coal by capturing carbon dioxide and burying it underground, but that doesn\u2019t make the coal itself cleaner. And more important, the bulk of the exports of coal to China involve metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel, not generate electricity.\n\nTrump claims \u201cthings are changing\u2019 in West Virginia thanks to his administration\u2019s policies. But again Trump is trying to take credit for things outside his control. Market forces and external factors, such as China imposing regulations on mining its domestic coal supply coupled with an increased demand for coking coal, have contributed to a price surge, making it cheaper to import coal from the United States.", "lang": "en"}
