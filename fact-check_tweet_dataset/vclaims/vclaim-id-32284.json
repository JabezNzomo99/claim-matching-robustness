Alt News did a keyword search and found a quote-tweet by Tata Group from February 15, 2016, where the company reiterated the same.\n\nMoreover, had the company made such an announcement, it would have been reported in the media. The lack of reports and no mention of any such decision on the company website also hint that the viral message is false.", "lang": "en"}
