As the controversy over the release of the movie gains steam, BJP supporters are quick to wash their hands off the key players who have threatened violence and insist that they belong to other parties. Let us do a quick fact check of the four claims mentioned in the tweet to see if there is any truth behind them.\n\nThe man at the center of the Padmavati uproar, Lokendra Singh Kalvi is the founder president of Rajput Karni Sena. He is the person reported by ANI as saying \u201cJauhar ki jwala hai, bahut kuch jalega. Rok sako to rok lo.\u201d (This is the fire of jauhar, a lot of things will burn. Stop us if you can.)\n\nBJP spokesperson would like us to believe that he is from Congress. Is he? Let us find out.\n\nKalvi is the son of Kalyan Singh Kalvi who was Cabinet minister in Chandra Shekhar\u2019s four-month Union government in 1990-91. He fought the 1993 assembly polls from Nagaur as an independent but lost. In 1998 Lok Sabha polls, he was the BJP candidate from Barmer. He lost this time as well.\n\nHe joined Congress before 2008 Rajya Sabha elections but didn\u2019t get a ticket and finally in 2014 Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhra Raje inducted him into BJP in what was called a \u201cmasterstroke\u201d. Rajasthan state BJP President stated that \u201cHe had left BJP for some time. He has rejoined the family. Whenever a family member rejoins the party it\u2019s a happy occasion\u201d\n\nTo sum up, Kalvi had fought election on a BJP ticket in 1998, joined Congress in 2008 and returned to the BJP family in 2014 and his current political inclinations are not documented. We are not sure on what basis BJP spokesperson is now claiming that Kalvi is from Congress.\n\nIt was Mahipal Singh Makrana, president of Rajasthan unit of Rajput Karni Sena who said that they would not hesitate to chop Deepika\u2019s nose like Shurpanakha.\n\nMakrana has one picture with Arvind Kejriwal, on the basis of which it seems the conclusion was made that he is from AAP.\n\nMakrana has several pictures with other leaders including Togadia. In the past he has supported Adityanath and even supported Hardik Patel last year. There is no evidence to suggest that he belongs to AAP.\n\nOn the Padmavati controversy, you can see him here sharing the stage with Diya Kumari, BJP Rajasthan MLA.\n\nRegarding his picture with Arvind Kejriwal, he himself has described it as a meeting between AAP leaders and Thakur Bane Singh, father of Gajendra Singh who died in an AAP rally. Makrana accompanied the father of Gajendra Singh to this meeting. His Facebook post can be seen below.\n\nFurther in a comment, he had stated that the purpose of going to Delhi was not to meet Arvind Kejriwal but to raise the issue that the promises made after Gajendra Singh\u2019s death were not fulfilled. In this comment, he further stated that after Karni Sena\u2019s warning, the Delhi Government promised to execute the pending issues within a month.\n\nAs seen from his Facebook posts and pictures, Abhishek Som seems to be a Samajwadi Party supporter. He announced a 5 crore bounty on Bhansali, Deepika Padukone\u2019s head.\n\nWe tried to get in touch with the SP Spokesperson regarding the same but haven\u2019t been able to yet. We will update the article when we get a response from SP regarding this issue.\n\nMaking no further comments on this claim, we list here statements of BJP leaders on Padmavati controversy:\n\n1. Telangana BJP MLA Raja Singh threatened to set theaters on fire if they screen \u2018Padmavati\u2019\n\n2. Suraj Pal Amu, Haryana\u2019s BJP Chief Media Coordinator: \u201cWant to congratulate Meerut youth for announcing Rs 5 crore bounty for beheading Deepika, Bhansali. We will reward the ones beheading them, with Rs 10 crore, and also take care of their family\u2019s needs\u201d\n\nThe theory that those who threatening the cast of Padmavati film were members of AAP/SP/Congress was repeated by many of those who support BJP on social media.\n\nOut of all the claims that Mahipal Makrana is from AAP, Abhishek Som is from SP, Lokendra Kalvi is from congress and that BJP doesn\u2019t endorse violence, the only one which has some basis is that Abhishek Som is a SP sympthaizer. None of the others are based in facts. Yet, this rumour has made many rounds of social media.", "lang": "en"}
