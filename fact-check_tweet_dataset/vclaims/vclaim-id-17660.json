So, like for example, like in the case of China: China was growing double digit every year. So within a span of 20 years, China was able to uplift more than 700 million Chinese from poverty.\n\nSenatorial candidate Glenn Chong is wrong on two counts about China\u2019s economy: one, that it posted double-digit growth \u201cevery year\u201d; two, that it extricated more than 700 million Chinese from poverty within 20 years.\n\nChina\u2019s economy indeed rapidly grew when Deng Xiaoping initiated economic reform and opened up China\u2019s economy in 1978.\n\nIn the first 20 years of reform from 1978 to 1997, China\u2019s gross domestic product grew by an average 10.05 percent yearly, according to World Bank data. But contrary to Chong\u2019s claim, double-digit growth was not recorded \u201cevery year,\u201d only in 10 years during that period: 1978, 1983-85, 1987-88 and 1992-95. In 1990, GDP growth was 3.91 percent.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2017, China\u2019s GDP rose yearly by an average 9.13 percent, according to the same data. In those two decades, the Asian giant experienced double-digit growth only in six years\u20142003-07 and 2010\u2014not \u201cevery year.\u201d\n\nIt also took China nearly 37 years to cut its poor population by more than 700 million, not 20 years as Chong claimed.\n\nAccording to the China Statistical Yearbook, China\u2019s poor population stood at 765 million in 1980. At the turn of the millenium, China still had 462 million people living in poverty. It had reduced poverty headcount by 303 million by then.\n\nBy 2017, China\u2019s poor numbered under 31 million. After 37 years, China lifted 735 million from poverty.\n\nAs of posting, the YouTube video of Chong\u2019s interview has garnered 13,000 views and 626 likes. It was also shared on Facebook and had 755 interactions.\n\nFang, C., Garnaut, R. & Song, L.
