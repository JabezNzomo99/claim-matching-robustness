The Democrat-then-Republican-then-Independent former mayor of New York City has devoted part of his considerable fortune to environmental and anti-gun causes. But that has meant that Democrats running in red states have scurried to avoid any association with him.\n\nRep. Bruce Braley (D), who is running to fill an open Senate seat in Iowa, said during a debate with his opponent Joni Ernst (R) that he had never met Bloomberg, even though Bloomberg is featured in NRA ads attacking Braley. With phrases like \u201che can\u2019t stick to the truth,\u201d the NRA all but calls Rep. Bruce Braley a liar in this advertisement.\n\nBack in 2010, Braley spoke at an event sponsored by No Labels, a nonpartisan group which seeks to urge politicians to move beyond party labels to focus on pressing issues. After he spoke, his office issued a news release (featured in the NRA ad) that noted that Braley, who spoke of growing up in a bipartisan household, was \u201cjoined by a bipartisan group of current and former elected officials, including Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Rep. Bob Inglis (R-SC) and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I), among others.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that Braley and Bloomberg were there at the same time, let alone met. The video of the event shows that Braley spoke for about five minutes during the morning session, while Bloomberg appeared as part of an afternoon panel hours later. Busy politicians generally don\u2019t hang out at conferences such as this, but simply show up when scheduled.\n\nThe NRA skates past this choreography by using weasel words \u2013 they were \u201cboth at the same event\u201d and \u201clook at this\u201d \u2014 while juxtaposing a photograph of Bloomberg during his panel with a photograph of Braley speaking. There is a small rip between the photographs, framed by an American flag, so a casual viewer might think it is a single photograph. (The Fact Checker had to pause the video to notice the rip, as the two photos only appear for three seconds in the 30-second ad.)\n\nThe Braley staff points to two tweets that they say show that Braley and Bloomberg did not cross paths that day \u2014 one from Sarah Benzing, Bruce\u2019s current campaign manager and former chief of staff, and the other from Matt Canter, who was staffing Gillibrand that day\n\n\u201cThe intent of the ad is to tell Iowa voters Braley and Bloomberg share the same views and support the same extremist gun control measures,\u201d said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam, who acknowledged that the photos were taken separately.\u201cOur charge is that they are allied, they were at the same event, and Braley is slick.\u201d\n\nCertainly, the NRA has a serious policy dispute with Braley, who earns an \u201cF\u201d rating from the NRA. He is also running against a proud gun owner who displays her weapon in her ads, vowing to unload on Obamacare.\n\nThe NRA has no idea whether Bloomberg and Braley ever met, but this ad certainly suggests that Braley is lying when he says had never did. Ironically, the only evidence the NRA can cite is that both men, hours apart, attended a meeting designed to break down barriers between people with different political views. That\u2019s pretty slick \u2014 and worthy of Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
