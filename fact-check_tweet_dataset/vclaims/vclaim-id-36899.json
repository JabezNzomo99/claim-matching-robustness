It has been shared more than 950 times.\n\nThe post reads: \u201cSo who\u2019s really to blame here? In 2010 Bob Brown led the Australian Greens with the ALP which allowed Prime Minister Julia Gillard to form government. As a result of this the Greens gained the balance of power and signed the Native Forest Protection Act, which defunded National Park Rangers and Control Burn Programs.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nOther Facebook posts with a similar claim were published here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nThe posts are misleading; it is true that Gillard\u2019s Australian Labor Party (ALP) formed a coalition government with the Greens in 2010, but the government did not -- and has never -- passed a law called the Native Forest Protection Act.\n\nFollowing a federal election in 2010 that resulted in a hung parliament, the ALP and the Greens signed a parliamentary agreement that allowed Gillard to form and maintain a government.\n\nThe photo in the misleading post, which was taken by an Australian Associated Press photographer, shows the agreement being signed on September 1, 2010 in Canberra, Australia's capital.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo on the AAP website:\n\nThe photo was also published in this ABC News report on the deal.\n\nBut the coalition government never passed a law called the Native Forest Protection Act.\n\nA search for \u201cNative Forest Protection\u201d on the Federal Register of Legislation, a database of Australian laws, produces no results. The purported law also does not appear in the alphabetical list of Acts currently in force, no longer in force or as made.\n\nA search on the Parliament of Australia\u2019s website found the \u201cNative Forest Protection Bill\u201d was introduced in Parliament in 1996 but was never passed into law.\n\nThe purpose of the bill, as per its explanatory memorandum, was \u201cto provide protection for native forests through: prohibition of logging in high conservation value native forests\u201d and the \u201cphasing out and subsequent prohibition of the export of woodchips derived from native forests.\u201d\n\nThe bill did not propose any cuts to national park rangers or control burn programs.", "lang": "en"}
