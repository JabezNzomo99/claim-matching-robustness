Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: A man has poured milk on the Kabba (in Mecca) and said that their ancestors are Hindu. He also shouted that the Kabba is holy Shivaling. Fact: The person in the video was pouring petrol on the Kabba, not milk. Also, nothing was reported about him shouting about Hinduism or Shivaling. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched about the news on Google with the keywords \u2018Man pours milk on Kabba\u2019, many newspaper articles published in 2017 on this issue can be found in the search results but the exact posted video was found to be in circulation only from 2018. According to the \u2018Gulf Today\u2019 tweet, the man in the video was arrested by the security forces for pouring gasoline on the holy Kabba. According to an article in the \u2018Gulf News\u2019, the security forces clarified that the man was trying to set himself on fire, not the Kabba. The exact video can be found to be uploaded by \u2018The Islamic Information\u2019 and \u2018Diva Magazine Pakistan\u2019 with a similar description of a man throwing petrol on the Kabba.\n\nAlso, if the bottle in his hands is properly observed, it can be found that the colour of the liquid in the bottle is reddish. So, it cannot be milk.\n\nAlso, nothing was reported in the articles about him shouting the slogans related to Hinduism or Shivaling.\n\nTo sum it up, the man in the video was throwing petrol on the Kabba, not milk. Also, nothing was reported about him shouting pro-Hindu slogans.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
