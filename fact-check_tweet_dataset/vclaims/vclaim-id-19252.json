(RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, \u2018Information Is The Currency Of Democracy\u2019?)\n\nWashington\u2019s estate at Mount Vernon has encountered so many quotes falsely attributed to Washington over the years that it keeps a list of \u201cspurious quotations.\u201d The specific statement about the importance of firearms appears on that list.\n\n\u201cThis quotation does not show up in any of Washington\u2019s writings, nor does any closely related quote,\u201d writes his Mount Vernon estate.\n\nIndeed, the Caller searched his writings, as well as his recorded speeches, yet found no matching or similar expressions anywhere.\n\nQuote Investigator, a website that traces the origins of quotations, credits C. S. Wheatley with writing the statement about firearms. The earliest instance of the quote occurs in a 1926 opinion piece Wheatley wrote for an outdoors magazine, where it appears in close proximity to a reference to an address made by Washington.\n\n\u201cThe passage was composed by C. S. Wheatley and not by George Washington,\u201d writes Quote Investigator. \u201cUnfortunately, the text was misread, and the words were incorrectly attributed to Washington. The faulty ascription was widely propagated in newspapers by the 1970s and 1980s.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
