April 17, 2019.\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Ms Ganley\u2019s claim that small-scale fracking in the NT\u2019s Beetaloo Basin would create more than 6500 full-time jobs and deliver economic impact over 25 years of up to $2.8 billion for the territory, plus over $9 billion for the nation. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck found Ms Ganley\u2019s claim to be mostly true.\n\nFederal Resources and Northern Australia Minister Matt Canavan was in Darwin on April 17 to publicise an April 2 federal budget announcement of $8.4 million in funding to fast-track development of gas reserves in the Northern Territory\u2019s Beetaloo Basin.\n\n\u201cWe want to get on with the job. We want to get the gas up out of the ground and into people\u2019s homes and businesses as quickly as we can,\u201d Senator Canavan said in a statement. [2]\n\nKathy Ganley, the Country Liberal Party candidate for the NT seat of Solomon, joined Senator Canavan in Darwin and said that the NT would greatly benefit from even small-scale development of the Beetaloo Basin. Solomon is one of two federal seats in the Northern Territory. It\u2019s held by Labor\u2019s Luke Gosling with a margin of 6.1 per cent. [1]\n\nThe Beetaloo Basin is about 500km south-east of Darwin in the Sturt Plateau region between the towns of Katherine and Elliott and includes pastoral land and indigenous communities. Around 70 per cent of the Territory's shale gas resources are estimated to lie in the Beetaloo Basin, reserves that could potentially raise Australia's global ranking of gas resources from seventh to sixth. Farmers, businesses and industry are divided over whether fracking should be permitted because of the risk of pollution to rivers and bores. Pro-fracking advocates argue it will be a boon for jobs and economic growth. [3]\n\nThe $8.4 million federal budget pledge to fast-track development of the NT\u2019s gas reserves received little publicity and surprised anti-fracking groups when it was announced in the April 2 budget. [4]\n\nThe NT had a moratorium on fracking or hydraulic fracturing pending an independent inquiry into the gas extraction. [5]\n\nAAP FactCheck asked the Country Liberal Party for the source of Ms Ganley\u2019s jobs and growth figures and was directed to the 2018 Scientific Inquiry into Hydraulic Fracturing in the Northern Territory final report.\n\nThe report was conducted by Justice Rachel Pepper and a panel of scientists who took 15 months and made 135 recommendations. Justice Pepper stated the report was \u201ctruly independent\u201d of government. [6]\n\nThe Pepper report concluded the challenges and risks associated with any onshore shale gas industry in the NT could be \"appropriately managed\". [3]\n\nThe Pepper report was required to determine the economic risks and impacts of hydraulic fracturing in the NT and engaged economic consultants ACIL Allen Consulting Pty Ltd (ACIL Allen), to compile an assessment contained in the Pepper report, titled The Economic Impacts of a Potential Shale Gas Development in the Northern Territory. [7]\n\nThe ACIL Allen assessment divided the economic impact of any onshore shale gas development into four scenarios based on whether or not the moratorium was lifted and how much exploration was permitted.\n\nThe figures quoted by Ms Ganley came from the middle-range scenario whereby the moratorium is lifted and \u201cmoderate-scale development\u201d occurs with the majority of gas sold into the east coast market aided by additional gas pipeline infrastructure. [8]\n\nThe exact same jobs and economic figures were published in a media report about the $8.4 million pledge immediately following the federal budget. \u201cThe money would also help the Territory meet some of the 135 recommendations from the Pepper report to help launch the basin as a prospective gas field,\u201d the report said. [9]\n\nThe assessment supports Ms Ganley\u2019s claim of more than 6500 full-time jobs and an economic impact over 25 years of up to $2.8 billion for the Northern Territory and over $9 billion for Australia. However, these figures come from the middle-range scenario with moderate-scale development, not \u201csmall scale\u201d as Ms Ganley stated. [8]", "lang": "en"}
