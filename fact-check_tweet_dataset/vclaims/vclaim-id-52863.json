It\u2019s a very unfortunate situation and we have just begun the fight, we will fight... Does the government want the youth of Madhya Pradesh to sink in a sea of alcohol?\u201d\n\nHe then went on to say, \u201cWhat is the excise department doing? What are they for? Why does not it stop the selling of illegal liquor? Will you send the alcohol to everybody\u2019s home. It will make the youth hollow and destroy the state. But the farmers should not ask for loan waivers, youth should not ask for unemployment allowance, the poor should not talk about Sambal Yojana, nobody should ask for money from the chief minister, and that\u2019s why spread the alcohol in the state to such an extent that people drink and stay drunk.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
