But not data shows that the country generates over 62 tonnes of waste a year.\n\u2022 None Two claims on Lagos\u2019s waste generation and the city\u2019s population were unproven. \n\n\n\nPiling waste posed a \u201cgrave danger\u201d to people in Nigeria, a national newspaper said, putting them at risk of environmental hazards and epidemics.\n\nAs Africa\u2019s most populous country struggled to come to grips with the problem, recycling solid waste could help prevent disasters, Nigeria\u2019s\n\nThe article made a number of claims about waste in Nigeria. We checked four of them.\n\nThe article\u2019s statistics were gathered during\n\nin Lagos in March 2019, its author Adaku Onyenucheya told Africa Check.\n\nShe could not recall who had provided the figures as a recording had been lost. But she said she had been referring to waste in general, not only solid waste as the headline of\n\ndefines waste as \u201cmaterial left over after products have been made by producers and after they have been used by consumers\u201d.\n\nBut the statistic was for sub-Saharan Africa. The report\n\nthat Nigeria alone produced 40,959 tonnes of municipal solid waste a day,\n\nas waste collected by municipalities from residences, industries, institutions and construction.\n\nof the report has data for 2016, when solid waste generation in Nigeria rose to\n\n. But it did not have data on non-solid or liquid waste, according to the\n\nWe therefore rate this claim as incorrect based on the most recent publicly available national data.\n\n\n\n \n\n How were these figures calculated?\n\n\n\n To arrive at its most recent estimate, the World Bank relied on a number of sources. peer-reviewed journal articles and cited academic papers. Where data was not available, it relied on its studies and those from other donors or project documents. \n\n\n\n Models were then used to project future waste generation. These suggested that Nigeria would produce 54.8 million tonnes of solid waste in 2030, and 107 million tonnes in 2050. \n\n\n\n There was an acute lack of data on waste management in Nigeria and many other African countries, said \n\n\n\n told Africa Check it did not have data on waste generated by Nigerians. \n\n\n\n Waste generation was a \u201chighly variable parameter\u201d affected by factors such as the city and even the seasons, said Dr Chidozie Nnaji, a water resources and environmental engineering \n\n\n\n Nnaji said most waste generation studies were localised, and there was a danger in \u201cover-generalising\u201d their results. \n\n\n\nIn its 2018 report, the World Bank\n\neach person in Nigeria generated an average of 0.5 kilograms of solid waste a day in 2016.\n\nThe report gave Nigeria\u2019 population as 186 million people in 2016. But the country\u2019s statistics bureau\n\nthe 2016 population at just over 193 million. There's been no official population count since 2006, and those figures\n\nOther sources showed that each person\u2019s average waste generation was close to the claim, analysts told Africa Check.\n\nA survey of waste management in Abuja by\n\n, estimated it at 0.63 kilograms per person.\n\nObiora Ezeudu is an environmental engineer and researcher at the\n\nHe told Africa Check that this study \u201cassumed that Abuja has equal representation of all Nigerian entities in terms of culture and ethnicity and socio-economic\u201d. These factors influenced the waste generation rate, Ezeudu said.\n\nDr Thaddeus Nzeadibe, a senior lecturer in the geography department of the\n\n, said Ogwueleka\u2019s rate of 0.63 kilograms per person was a sound estimate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t seem to have an idea of any other study done on Nigeria\u2019s per capita waste generation,\u201d said Nzeadibe, who has a doctorate in environmental management. \u201cHis rate is a clear representation of Nigeria\u2019s per capita waste generation.\u201d\n\nBut he added that \u201cbecause it was done in 2013, it is possible the rate would change if the study was done in 2019\u201d.\n\n2016, the National Bureau of Statistics estimated Lagos\u2019s population at\n\nBut this figure is contested. The Lagos state government\u2019s website\n\n21 million, the number given in the Guardian\u2019s article.\n\nWhat could explain this difference?\n\n. He told Africa Check that to e\n\nstimate Nigeria\u2019s 2016 population, the agency used both its own survey and projections from the National Population Commission.\n\nBut Lagos took a different approach, Olarewaju said.\n\n\"The commission based its calculations on who was seen physically during the census, whereas Lagos state based its calculations on those who were usual residents of Lagos state, whether seen or not seen during the period.\"\n\nis responsible for the state\u2019s waste collection and disposal.\n\nhas headed the agency for more than 10 years. He chose to use a \u201csafe\u201d population figure 20 million, and estimated that an average person in Lagos generated 0.5 kilograms of waste daily.\n\nBut this \u201cmay have increased to 0.6 kilograms because of an increase in affluence and rate of generation\u201d, he told Africa Check. The city produced about 10,000 to 12,000 tonnes of all forms of waste a day, he estimated.\n\nBut, again, Lagos\u2019s population is contested, with estimates ranging from 12 million to 21 million. And the World Bank\u2019s\n\nestimated that only 10% of the city\u2019s waste was collected.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim as unproven.", "lang": "en"}
