The Galleries stripped RT of credentials to cover the U.S. Congress in person. While it may appear that RT has been singled out, it is not entirely clear which outlets registered as foreign agents continue to have the credentials.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "December 10, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-3301", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-says-fara-registration-resticts-rt-operations/28905889.html", "vclaim": "In a letter dated November 21, the Executive Committee of the Radio and Television Correspondents\u2019 Galleries at the U.S. Congress notified RT that it had voted unanimously to withdraw the Russian government-funded international broadcaster\u2019s credentials after the U.S. Justice Department forced RT to register as a foreign agent earlier that month.\n\nRT posted the letter on its website. It reads: \u201cThe rules of the Galleries state clearly that news credentials may not be issued to any applicant employed \u2018by any foreign government or representative thereof.\u2019 Upon its registration as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), RT Network became ineligible to hold news credentials.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Congress created the original press gallery in the late 19th Century, to take the responsibility of journalist accreditation from the shoulders of the House Speaker, the elected leader of the House of Representatives. In 1939, Congress established the Radio-Television Correspondents Galleries to handle broadcast media accreditation. The Galleries are under the control of separate committees of correspondents, which decide on which news outlets qualify for press credentials. The Galleries handle \u201caccreditation, liaison, distribution of information, management of logistics, and enforcement of rules.\u201d\n\nThe decision means that RT is no longer able to access the press galleries of the U.S. Congress, and assign reporters to attend congressional sessions, hearings and news conferences.\n\nCommenting on the decision, RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan stated: \u201cTo all the self-righteous defenders of 'freedom of speech' who oh-so-ardently proclaimed that FARA registration places no restrictions whatsoever on RT's journalistic work in the US: Withdrawal of Congressional credentials speaks much louder than empty platitudes.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cAnd to borrow from Orwell, all \u2018foreign agents\u2018 are equal, but looks like only RT is denied congressional accreditation on the basis of FARA status, while the likes of NHK and China Daily carry on business as usual, and US officials continue to claim that the forced FARA registration for RT America's operating company isn't at all discriminatory.\u201d\n\nIn its piece criticizing the decision, RT quoted George Galloway, a former British lawmaker who is now one of its broadcasters, as saying: \u201cYou make someone register as a foreign agent, and then you ban them because they are foreign agents. It is the ultimate Catch-22.\u201d\n\nRT also quoted Richard Black, a Republican Virginia state senator, as describing the decision as \u201cabsolutely censorship.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info previously fact-checked similar statements, including by Simonyan (fact-check 1, fact-check 2, and fact-check 3), made in the context of the outlet\u2019s registration as a foreign agent.\n\nObjecting to its registration under FARA, RT has been portraying itself as a bona fide media outlet engaged in journalism. However, many experts accuse it of spreading propaganda, as well as socially- and politically-polarizing content, on the Kremlin\u2019s behalf.\n\nAsked by the newspaper Kommersant in a 2008 interview why Russian taxpayers should finance their government\u2019s foreign-language media, Simonyan replied: \u201cWell, roughly speaking, for the same reason the country needs the Ministry of Defense.\u201d RT, she added, led an information war against the entire Western media during Russia\u2019s war with Georgia in 2008 and stands ready to do so again if needed.\n\nAsked how RT\u2019s governmental objectives fit with journalistic integrity, she said: \u201cWell, the same way as for all the other channels. There is no impartiality.\u201d\n\nA January 2017 U.S. intelligence report probing Russia\u2019s alleged interference into the 2016 U.S. presidential election concluded that RT \u201cconducts strategic messaging for [the] Russian government\u201d and \u201cseeks to influence politics, [and] fuel discontent in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAccording to Charles Lewis, a professor at American University\u2019s School of Communication and executive editor of its Investigative Reporting Workshop, over the past year RT \u201chas been found to have worked in direct and obvious tandem with the Russian government at the same time as its apparent interference in the recent 2016 presidential election.\u201d\n\nAs such, he says, RT \u201cno longer has the appearance or the apparent reality of just another international, foreign government-funded broadcast organization.\u201d\n\nOn November 13, RT complied with the U.S. Department of Justice order to register as a foreign agent.\n\nFollowing the Gallery\u2019s executive committee decision, the Russian broadcaster aimed harsh criticism at the U.S. government, hinting it was a violaton of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment free speech protections.\n\nOn November 25, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill allowing designation of news outlets receiving foreign funding as foreign agents. Authorities have designated nine U.S. outlets, including the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, as well as Polygraph.info\u2019s partner Factograph, as foreign agents and banned their journalists from the Russian parliament.\n\nThe decision to strip RT\u2019s news credentials came after the U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert stated just a day earlier that \u201cFARA does not police the content of information disseminated, does not limit the publication of information or advocacy materials, and does not restrict an organization\u2019s ability to operate.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department, which administers the FARA filings, states that foreign registration \u201cdoes not inhibit freedom of expression\u201d or \u201crestrict the content of information disseminated.\u201d It merely \u201crequires public disclosure of certain activities and relationships through registration by \u2018agents of foreign principals\u2019 with the Justice Department...it requires only registration, labeling of informational materials and broadcasts, and recordkeeping.\u201d\n\nIn addition, FARA \u201cdoes not restrict registrants from operating,\u201d the U.S. Justice Department says. \u201cOther U.S. agents of foreign media entities are currently registered under FARA and continue to operate freely in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Gallery executive committee\u2019s RT decision invoked its own rules which \u201crequire all Gallery members to be bona fide news gatherers and/or reporters whose chief attention is given to\u2014or more than one-half of their earned income derived from\u2014the gathering or reporting of news.\u201d Gallery members must not be employed \u201cby any foreign government or representative thereof\u201d or be \u201cengaged in any lobbying activities.\u201d The Galleries also rely on \u201cadditional criteria\u201d set by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration\u201d to approve membership applications.\n\nThe chairman of the executive committee did not return calls from Polygraph.info, but on December 8, Gallery executive committee put out a statement on the RT claim that NHK, Japan\u2019s publicly funded TV agency, was also a foreign agent.\n\n\u201cThis is not accurate,\u201d said the executive committee, in an e-mailed statement. \u201cThe company in question, NHK Cosmomedia America, Inc., is a separate entity that has never been issued credentials by the Congressional Radio-TV Correspondents\u2019 Galleries.\u201d\n\nChina Daily is not listed as a credentialed publication by the U.S. Senate Press Gallery, which approves traditional print media. News reports indicate China Daily has filed as a foreign agent, although Reuters reports China People\u2019s Daily has not.\n\nPeople\u2019s Daily is, in fact, listed on the press gallery Web site as a credentialed organization and as the foreign principal under the title of People's Daily Overseas Edition in a FARA registration record, according to a report from RFE/RL and FARA website.\n\nRFE/RL further reports that the most recent Justice Department compliance record, published in early 2017, listed NHK, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., and China Daily.\n\nA search on the FARA website leads to a FARA registration document identifying NHK as a registrant, though it is not clear if that registration remains active.\n\nFinally, the list of members with admission to the daily press galleries as of February 2016 includes NHK, China People\u2019s Daily, and Canadian Broadcasting Corp, though it is unclear if the list is up to date.\n\nTo add a complication, a source on background tells Polygraph.info the credentialing rules of the two correspondent organizations vary.\n\nFirst Amendment experts debate whether the correspondents\u2019 decision on RT constitutes censorship or violates the First Amendment, and whether FARA restricts the operations of media entities designated as foreign agents.\n\nIt is not censorship, says Lata Nott, executive director with the Newseum\u2019s First Amendment Center, \u201csince RT is still free to publish the stories that it wants to publish. It probably doesn\u2019t infringe on the First Amendment\u2014the press galleries aren\u2019t really considered public forums so RT\u2019s freedom of assembly isn\u2019t being violated.\u201d\n\n\u201cCensorship generally means restricting the publication of specific content,\u201d says Gregory Magarian, a professor of law at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, Missouri. \u201cThis situation doesn\u2019t seem to fit that definition,\u201d though he did say it\u2019s possible RT could claim the executive committee violated free speech principles.\n\n\u201cThe general public can\u2019t access the press galleries so it\u2019s probably not unconstitutional for RT to be denied access to them as well,\u201d said Nott of the Newseum, who points out the U.S. Supreme Court \u201chas been pretty clear that a media outlet\u2019s right to information isn\u2019t any greater than the general public\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would argue that discriminating against RT violated the First Amendment, but I would probably lose,\u201d Magarian agreed. \u201cCourts give the government a lot of latitude to regulate foreign actors. In addition, courts are leery of second-guessing Congress\u2019s control of its own proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe experts say while the FARA law, itself, doesn\u2019t sanction a foreign government media company, there appears to be nothing barring the correspondents\u2019 executive committee action.", "lang": "en"}
