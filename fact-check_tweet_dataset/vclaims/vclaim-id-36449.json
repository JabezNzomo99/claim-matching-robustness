No, that's not true: it is a hoax we found on a site that recently published a viral death hoax about Clint Eastwood. It appears the new hoax has not been promoted yet so this might be the first time in history a fact checker pre-emptively debunks a death hoax before it even started spreading.\n\nWe found the hoax on this site (archived here) under the title \"TOM CRUISE Died Filming A Deadly Jet Fighter Dogfight Stunt For His New Movie TOP GUN 2\". It did not contain any text except for a link to a second page that had this video embedded (archived here):\n\nNote that the video is just a snippet from a real news report about an air crash that did not involve Tom Cruise:\n\nThe site tricks people into sharing a link to the hoax by obscuring the video after a few seconds with a \"sensitive content\" warning and then demanding they share the link on Facebook to keep watching.\n\nThe exact same thing happened with a different hoax about Clint Eastwood that was also run by the same site. We wrote up the technical details of that hoax here:\n\nIt was an investigation of that hoax that Lead Stories stumbled on the (unreleased) Tom Cruise death hoax.", "lang": "en"}
