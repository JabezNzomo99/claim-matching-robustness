In fact, soldiers were at the scene in the town of Chimanimani helping them to cross the wreckage left by a mudslide after the cyclone struck. The photo was taken by an AFP photographer who confirmed that members of the Zimbabwean military were at the scene but asked not to be photographed.\n\nAs reported by AFP, more than 300 people have been confirmed dead in Mozambique and Zimbabwe since Idai made landfall on March 15 and aid officials have warned that hundreds of thousands of lives are at risk due to spiralling humanitarian needs.\n\nIn Chimanimani, where the photograph was taken, at least 217 people are listed as missing. The district remains cut off after roads were swallowed by massive sinkholes and bridges were ripped to pieces.\n\nA tweet which has been shared more than 350 times, and which we\u2019ve archived here, implies that Zimbabwe\u2019s President Mnangagwa favoured a photo opportunity instead of helping those affected by the cyclone, one of the worst storms to hit southern Africa in decades.\n\nAnother tweet said: \u201cIf #CycloneIDAI was a demonstration by the opposition, the government of #Zimbabwe would have long sent police and soldiers in trucks and helicopters to beat, teargas, arrest and shoot it back to where it came from.\u201d\n\nThe image carried by the first tweet shows children in school uniform trying to cross a fallen tree branch, their feet covered in red mud.\n\nBut contrary to the tweet\u2019s criticism that the children had to \u201cfind their own way to safety\u201d, members of the Zimbabwean military were at the scene to help them.\n\nThe photo was taken in Chimanimani by AFP photographer Zinyange Auntony -- who explained that the soldiers instructed him to not take photos of them.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers cleared way for them, otherwise they would not been able to get to the junction where I photographed them,\u201d Auntony told AFP Fact Check.\n\n\u201cZimbabwean soldiers are generally never comfortable with being photographed and this case was no different. I managed to have a gentlemen's agreement that I photograph only with them (the military) behind me,\u201d he added.\n\nThe original photo can be found here along with others taken by Auntony in Chimanimani.\n\nAs for the photograph of President Mnangagwa, it was indeed taken after the cyclone hit.\n\nIt can be seen in a tweet from Zimbabwe\u2019s Ministry of Information, Publicity & Broadcasting posted on March 18, when Mnangagwa swore in Oliver Chidawu as a minister.\n\nMistrust in Zimbabwe\u2019s army was amplified when deadly protests erupted in the country in January this year after the government more than doubled fuel pump prices -- AFP reported on this here.", "lang": "en"}
