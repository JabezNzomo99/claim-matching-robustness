(READ: The devil's in the details: 10 logistical blunders at SEA Games 2019)\n\nThe caption of the post, credited in the screenshots to journalist Ricky Velasco, reads: \u201cBut wait there\u2019s more. This to all the blunders in the SEA Games 2019. Meals are served to participating athletes. But using our flag as a table cover mantle? Notice that the flag even touches the floor.\u201d\n\nThe photos have been shared by various Facebook groups and personal accounts accumulating total shares of over 2,600 with 200 reactions and 100 comments.\n\nThe facts: The photos were not taken at any SEA Games events. These were originally captured in 2015 in an \"undisclosed event,\" according to Papina.\n\nPapina told Rappler in a Facebook message that he took the photo from his friend\u2019s post dated November 2015. \u201cWhat I gathered from my friend\u2019s post is it happened in 2015 in an undisclosed place,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a Facebook message to Rappler, Velasco said that his post was \"rigged\" or altered by trolls, as he did not actually mention the SEA Games. Velasco's post has since been deleted.\n\nIn a text message to Rappler, Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) chairman Butch Ramirez denied that a Philippine flag was used as a tablecloth at a SEA Games event, saying it was \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nPSC executive director Guillermo Iroy also said in a report that they checked various SEA Games venues and confirmed that the photos were not taken in any of those.\n\nRepublic Act (RA) No. 8491 or the Code of the National Flag states that the flag should not be used \u201cas a drapery, festoon, tablecloth.\u201d\n\nThis is just one of the false posts about the SEA Games circulating on social media. Another is the claim about Rizal Memorial Stadium being \u201cnot part of the official venues\u201d for 2019. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
