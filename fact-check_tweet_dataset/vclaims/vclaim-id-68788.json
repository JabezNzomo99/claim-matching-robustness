The Facebook page was later found to be set up by a consultant working for Kurz\u2019s opponent, Christian Kern.\n\nThe article\u2019s birthplace, YourNewsWire.com, is known for producing controversial and often falsified news stories. YourNewsWire.com says it delivers \"the news you want and the news other people won\u2019t report\".\n\nThis claim is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
