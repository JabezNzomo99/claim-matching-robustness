Kay Hagan for being missing in action as the ISIS threat grew.\n\n\"In January, President Obama refers to the Islamic State as a \u2018JV team,\u2019 \" the narrator says. \"Days later the Armed Services Committee holds a hearing on new global threats. Sen. Kay Hagan? Absent. In fact, Hagan\u2019s missed half the Armed Services Committee hearings this year.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve already checked whether Obama referred to the Islamic State as a JV team ( ). Here, we\u2019ll review Tillis\u2019 characterization of Hagan\u2019s attendance record on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nWe went through all the committee\u2019s meeting transcripts for 2014 to see which lawmakers were in attendance for each hearing.\n\nIn compiling the information, we ran into an obstacle.\n\nBecause the Senate Armed Services Committee often reviews confidential national-security information, it sometimes meets behind closed doors. Minutes for those meetings are not released to the public. Therefore, we\u2019re not able to determine attendance for those meetings.\n\nIn 2014, it appears there have been 11 closed hearings by the full committee. However, the committee has also held 22 open meetings this year, so we limited our calculations to those.\n\nHow many of the public meetings has Hagan attended? The record shows the answer is nine.\n\nThat\u2019s not a great percentage \u2014 41 percent \u2014 but is nine par for the course for a busy senator?\n\nNot exactly. While Hagan didn\u2019t have the worst attendance among the 26 members of the Armed Services Committee this year, she came close. Only five senators \u2014 Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; David Vitter, R-La.; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; and Mark Udall, D-Colo. \u2014 attended fewer meetings.\n\nMeanwhile, six of her colleagues attended at least 20 of the 22 meetings. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., as the chairman, and Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., as the ranking Republican, would be expected to have perfect or near-perfect attendance. But Sens. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., Tim Kaine, D-Va., and John McCain, R-Ariz., were present for at least 20 hearings.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s go back a year and look at 2013.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee held 28 open hearings in 2013, of which Hagan attended 14, putting her among those who attended hearings least often.\n\nFor those two years combined, then, Hagan was present for 23 of 50 open hearings. Only six senators have attended fewer open meetings. Republicans Vitter and Cruz attended the fewest hearings, 16, of any of the committee members.\n\nHagan\u2019s campaign did not dispute those numbers, but staffers said they were taken out of context.\n\nThey pointed us to an article by the Charlotte Observer that , spokeswoman for Levin. According to the Observer, Andringa said, \"Hagan appeared to have \u2018one of the best attendance records on the committee.\u2019 \"\n\nThat didn\u2019t mirror our findings, so we reached out to Andringa for clarification. We didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nHagan\u2019s campaign also explained that scheduling conflicts and other duties \u2014 including constituent issues, other committee hearings and bill drafting \u2014 kept her from attending all the committee meetings.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the February hearing \"on new global threats\" that Tillis highlighted in his ad.\n\nHagan\u2019s campaign said she did not attend that hearing on Feb. 11 on \"Current and Future World Threats\" because she had a constituent meeting with Jerry Ensminger, a former Marine who had discovered that families living on the Camp Lejeune military base in North Carolina were getting sick and, in some cases, dying from contaminated tap water used on the base from 1957 to 1987. (Congress to assist the victims of this problem in 2012 and Ensminger and others continue to lobby Congress .)\n\nThe Feb. 11 meeting, which included testimony from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, continued in a closed session on the afternoon of Feb. 27. It\u2019s unclear whether Hagan attended the closed hearing (and they didn\u2019t tell us). However, her campaign said she missed another Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in the morning of the same day to attend a banking committee meeting.\n\nTillis said that Hagan \"has missed half of the (Senate Armed Services) Committee's hearings in 2014.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t know the number of closed meetings she attended, so it\u2019s more accurate to say that Hagan missed half of the committee\u2019s public hearings.\n\nStill, Tillis has a point \u2014 in 2014, Hagan attended nine of the 22 open hearings, which is not only below half but which also ranked near the bottom among committee members.\n\nThe comment is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 3, 2014, 11:00 a.m.: This version of the story reflects additional information about why Hagan was unable to attend the Feb. 11 Senate Armed Services Committee meeting and about her schedule on Feb. 27. The additional information does not affect the ruling, which remains Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
