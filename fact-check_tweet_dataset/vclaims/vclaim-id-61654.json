Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced his intention to run for president, a political action committee attacking him for his foreign policy views, claiming that Paul sides with President Barack Obama on Iran.\n\n\"The Senate is considering tough new sanctions on Iran,\" the ad\u2019s narrator says. \"President Obama says he\u2019ll veto them, and Rand Paul is standing with him. Rand Paul supports Obama\u2019s negotiations with Iran, and he doesn\u2019t understand the threat.\"\n\nThe TV ad comes from the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, a Republican political action committee, and will run nationwide.\n\nThe United States and several other world powers reached an agreement with Iran in late March, expected to set in motion a final deal curbing Iran\u2019s ability to develop nuclear weapons, with a June 30 deadline. In a speech officially announcing his 2016 presidential campaign, Paul distanced himself from President Barack Obama\u2019s position on Iran.\n\n\"Successful negotiations with untrustworthy adversaries are only achieved from a position of strength,\" Paul said April 7. \"The difference between President Obama and myself, he seems to think you can negotiate from a position of weakness.\"\n\nWe wanted to know if Paul really does support the ongoing negotiations. We found that, in short, while Paul supports the idea of negotiating with Iran -- as opposed to say, military action -- it\u2019s misleading to equate his position to Obama\u2019s.\n\nPaul\u2019s staff and the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America pointed us to the same interview to support their respective sides -- a with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer.\n\nOn the one hand, in the interview, Paul critiqued Obama\u2019s current position. He said Congress should be able to review and approve a deal, which might force a tougher agreement. \"In doing so, maybe the president will negotiate a more appropriate deal where we actually get Iran to give up their nuclear ambitions,\" Paul said.\n\nOn the other hand, Paul said he is \"one of the senators who's in favor of negotiations with Iran. I want there to be a peaceful outcome, but I want to strengthen the president's hand.\"\n\nPaul has expressed support for negotiations instead of military action for keeping Iran from getting nuclear weapons for a while now.\n\n\"I want the outcome to be one that's not war,\" he said on Fox News in 2013. \"I think we've had quite a bit of war in the last decade. I would like to have an outcome where Iran agrees not to have nuclear weapons, but at the same time we have that without having a war.\" (David Weigel of compiled a timeline of Paul\u2019s Iran positions.)\n\nThe spokeswoman for the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, Lisa Booth, noted that Paul hasn\u2019t pushed for the new that some Republicans have promoted. he would veto any such bill because of the possibility that it could derail negotiations.\n\nAt a January Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Paul seemed to align with Obama on this point. \"As we move forward, I've been one who says new sanctions in the middle of negotiations is a huge mistake and may well break up the sanctions coalition, may well drive Iran away from the table,\" he said.\n\nBut the fact that Paul and Obama have similar views on this particular point does not mean that Paul supports Obama\u2019s negotiations with Iran as a whole. Another segment from Paul\u2019s remarks at the hearing better outlines his position -- that he\u2019ll wait and see before passing judgment on the substance of the deal, but also that he wants Congress to have some say.\n\n\"There's several of us on this side who do not blanketly (sic) say, no, we will not vote to approve an agreement,\" he said. \"But we want (the White House) to know that (members of Congress) have the right to vote to it, so you come talk to us.\"\n\nThe fact that Paul believes any deal needs to go through Congress is a pretty big difference between his and Obama\u2019s positions.\n\nPaul recently signed the to Iranian leaders informing them that Congress or a future president could scrap any deal reached this year. It\u2019s hard to argue that a senator who signed that letter supports Obama\u2019s policies, considering the administration and Democrats loudly , saying it was counterproductive to the negotiations.\n\nAdditionally, Paul is a cosponsor of pending legislation that would require Congress to review any deal with Iran -- legislation opposed by the White House. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest the bill, if passed, \"could potentially interfere with the ongoing negotiations.\"\n\n\"To say that Sen. Paul supports the administration's \u2018go at it alone\u2019 effort with the negotiations in Iran is a blatant distortion of his record,\" said Paul spokeswoman Eleanor May, adding that Paul has \"consistently attacked\" Obama for executive overreach and \"weak and inconsistent foreign policy.\"\n\nPaul hasn\u2019t been especially vocal about his views on the outcome of the most recent negotiations, concluded at the end of March. In fact, his first statement came just on April 6 -- and it shows neither outright support nor criticism.\n\n\"We don't know the details of the deal yet,\" Doug Stafford, a spokesman for Paul's PAC, told . \"Sen. Paul will be watching closely and believes any deal must make clear Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon, allows for full verification and is approved by Congress. He voted for sanctions both times they were put before Congress and believes only Congress should remove those sanctions.\"\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t germane to the specific claim we\u2019re checking, we wanted to give some context to a Paul quote included in the ad. The ad has audio of Paul saying, \"It\u2019s ridiculous to think that (Iran is) a threat to our national security.\" This quote came from a 2007 interview with right-wing radio host Alex Jones, where he spoke out against military hawks that he said were interested in invading Iran.\n\nNeedless to say, Paul has changed up his rhetoric on this point in the last eight years. In 2013, the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons was \"the most pressing issue of the day.\"\n\nAn ad attacking Paul said, \"Rand Paul supports Obama's negotiations with Iran.\"\n\nThe nugget of truth here is that Paul has expressed support for the idea of negotiating with Iran. Additionally, he has not outwardly critiqued nor praised the substance of the Obama administration\u2019s ongoing negotiations. However, Paul believes Congress should play a role in approving any deal, a notable difference from Obama\u2019s position.\n\nPaul differs from some other Republicans who unequivocally oppose the ongoing negotiations, but this difference isn\u2019t enough to say he supports Obama. We rate the statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
