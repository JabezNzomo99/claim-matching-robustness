He has promoted Gujarat ever since Modi was its CM, but this is the first time, I think, he\u2019s promoted Modi himself,\u201d is a claim accompanying a video viral on social media that features photographs of PM Modi appearing successively to the tune of a poem recited by Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nBJP MP and the party\u2019s treasurer for Jharkhand, Mahesh Poddar, was among those who shared the video (archive).\n\nSeveral other social media users and pages have shared the video claiming that Bachchan lent his voice in support of PM Modi. The Hindi poem recited by Bachchan starts with the words \u2013 \u201c\u092e\u0941\u091f\u094d\u0920\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0938\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u0932\u0947\u0915\u0930 , \u092d\u0930\u0915\u0930 \u091c\u0947\u092c\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u0936\u090f\u0902 ..\u0926\u093f\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0948 \u0905\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u092f\u0939\u0940, \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0915\u0930 \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0901, \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0915\u0930 \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0901\u2026\u201d\n\nWe found that the video was also shared with Kannada and Nepali captions. It seems to have been circulating on WhatsApp as well.\n\nAlt News looked by a few words of the poem on Google and found that it was recited by the Bollywood actor in 2018 during the opening episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati season 10. Bachchan can be heard reciting the same poem in the video below, which was uploaded by SonyLIV on September 3, 2018.\n\nThe actor had also shared a photograph of himself recording the poem two years ago.\n\nFurthermore, we were unable to locate any reports in the media claiming that Bachchan recited the said poetry in support of the Prime Minister. The assertions on social media are, thus, baseless.", "lang": "en"}
