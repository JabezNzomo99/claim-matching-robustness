A message is going viral on social media that says \u201c\ud83d\udce9\ud83d\udce9 Pradhan Mantri Mudra Shiksha Yojana\u201d. Under this scheme, your son / daughter will be provided free education from class 5 to college. .. add your son / daughter\u2019s name \u2026. \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 Registration form: \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/pradhanmantri_mudra_yojna .. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f Please share this message \ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\ude4f. \u201d Actually this post is wrong. There is no govt scheme like Prime Minister\u2019s money education scheme. The Government started the PMMY scheme in year 2015 for the assistance of people who have started small enterprises. Under this, a small amount of loan is given to people to start their venture (business).\n\nTo start your investigation, we clicked on the link in the message. Clicking on this link opens a page with URL http://pradhanmantri-mudra-yojna.imazesoft.com/. The page has an image of Prime Minister Modi with the logo of the Prime Minister\u2019s Mudra Scheme.\n\nBeneath this logo is a form. On this first page it says: \u2018Giving correct answer to the following 2 questions is necessary\u2019. And the two questions are: \u2018Q1: Are you a citizen of India?\u2019 And \u2018Q2: Have you opened the bank account under the Prime Minister\u2019s Jandhan scheme?\u2019. You can answer with \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 .\n\nWhether you press Yes or No, when you submit it, you are forwarded to the next page. Next they ask you about your state.\n\nAfter this you are asked to fill a form that needs your name, your child\u2019s name and your own mobile number. On the next page, you are asked to forward this message to 10 people.\n\nAfter you share this message with 10 people, you are asked to download a mobile app named True Balance. True Balance is a division of Balance Hero India Pvt Ltd. Truebalance is a mobile wallet app. We called and mailed the office of Truebalance but we did not get any response from there.\n\nWhen we searched about the Prime Minister Mudra Scheme, we came to know that Prime Minister Mudra Yojana is a govt scheme which was started by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 8, 2015. According to Moneycontrol.com, Over 165,000 people have been benefitted from this scheme so far.\n\nWe spoke to a PMMY official and he told us that \u201cthere is no scheme like Pradhan Mantri Mudra Shiksha Yojana. PM Modi launched a scheme called Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana in 2015. MUDRA is a refinancing institution. PMMY was launched to help those who have started their own small enterprises. MUDRA do not lend directly to the micro entrepreneurs / individuals. Mudra loans under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) can be availed of from nearby branch office of a bank, NBFC, MFIs etc. Borrowers can also now file online application for MUDRA loans on Mudramitra portal (www.mudramitra.in). There are no agents or middleman engaged by MUDRA for availing of Mudra Loans. The borrowers are advised to keep away from persons posing as Agents of MUDRA . PMMY\u2019s full name is Micro Units Development Refinance Agency.\u201d\n\nYou can have look at this website for full information on PMMY.\n\nConclusion: In our investigation, we found that the viral message is wrong. There is no Govt scheme by the name \u2018Prime Minister\u2019s Mudra Shiksha Yojna\u2019. Rather, there is a scheme called Prime Minister Mudra Yojna under which a small amount of loan is given to people to establish their own business.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
