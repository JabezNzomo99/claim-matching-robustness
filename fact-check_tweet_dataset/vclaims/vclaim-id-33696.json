This claim is false; the AFP photo actually shows R. David Edelman, who left his role at the White House two years prior to the whistleblower complaint being filed; Edelman has also refuted the claim.\n\nThe meme says: \u201cRemember this picture of Obama\u2019s White House staff crying the day after Trump won the election? Meet the alleged Ukraine call whistleblower.\u201d\n\nThe post was also shared on Facebook here and here and on Twitter here.\n\nThe anonymous whistleblower, whose August 2019 complaint about Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden prompted the impeachment inquiry, is described only as an intelligence official who worked at the White House, AFP reported here on November 14.\n\nA 1989 law protects federal government employees who report possibly illegal activity, gross mismanagement, abuse or waste of funds. The law bans any retaliation against such persons.\n\nLawyers for the whistleblower released a statement on November 6, 2019, which said: \u201cIdentifying any suspected name for the whistleblower will place that individual and their family at risk of serious harm. We will not confirm or deny any name that is published or promoted by supporters of the President. Disclosure of any name undermines the integrity of the whistleblower system and will deter any future whistleblowers.\u201d\n\nWhat we know about the image\n\nThe photo is real. It was originally taken by AFP photographer Nicholas Kamm on November 9, 2016. Here it is on AFP Forum:\n\nThe caption only names then-US national security adviser Susan Rice, third from right, and then-White House communications director Jen Psaki, third from left.\n\nWho is the man?\n\nThe man who the red arrow in the meme pointed to is actually R. David Edelman.\n\nEdelman served Obama as special assistant to the president for economic and technology policy, but he left government service and joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Internet Policy Research Initiative in March 2017. He was listed in the 2016 annual report to Congress of White House staff, but not in a report of staff issued on June 30, 2017, after Trump assumed office.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint was filed on August 12, 2019 and raises concerns about Trump\u2019s actions in July 2019.\n\nOn November 7, 2019, Edelman tweeted a correction to a slightly different version of the claim which said, \u201cLeft government in 2017. Sorry to disappoint, y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nThis topic was also fact-checked by Politifact and FactCheck.org.", "lang": "en"}
