Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of women being paid for their participation in Shaheen Bagh protests against CAA. Fact: At Shaheen Bagh, women are protesting against CAA since 15th December 2019. But, the video in the post is found to exist on the internet at least since 2017. So, the video has no connection with the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFrom the article of \u2018Indian Express\u2019, it can be found that women are holding a sit-in protest at Shaheen Bagh since 15th December 2019 against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).\n\n\n\nIn the video, the women with Congress Party scarves and flags can be seen collecting money. So when searched on Google with keywords \u2018Money distributed during Congress rally\u2019, many search results were obtained. In the results, the same video was found. The video has the timestamp \u2013 \u2018October 30, 2017\u2019 and the title as \u2018Congress Rally distribution of money\u2019. No additional information was found regarding the video. But, as the video is on the internet at least since 2017 and hence it can be ascertained that the video is in no way connected to the ongoing Shaheen Bagh protests.\n\nTo conclude, an old video falsely shared as \u2018women being paid for participation in Shaheen Bagh protest\u2019\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
