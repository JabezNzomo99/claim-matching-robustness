Michael P. Murphy, a deceased U.S. Navy SEAL, and a wall of names with graffiti over them.\n\n\"When is enough, enough, before We The People fight back against Soros funded AntiFU, BLMs and other radical groups that hate our nation for profit?\" the June 2 post says. \"Pure Evil. These men and women died so that those thugs could be free and this is how they show their gratitude. It sickens me. Arlington Memorial Cemetery, Washington D.C.\"\n\nThese posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nHere\u2019s why: None of these photos are from the Arlington National Cemetery, and all but one are from previous years, unrelated to the protests that started over George Floyd\u2019s death after a police officer pressed his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck.\n\nLet\u2019s take these one by one.\n\nThe photo of the fallen crosses is from May 2016, when a man in Henderson, Ky., was accused of driving a car through a Memorial Day display in the city\u2019s Central Park. The man, who reportedly said he was intoxicated at the time, was convicted the following year.\n\nThe second photo is an AFP image taken by Daniel Slim. The graffiti was \"left by demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd\" in Lafayette Square, according to the caption. The building is not a memorial; a spokesperson for the U.S. Park Police told PolitiFact it was a public bathroom.\n\nThe cracked memorial to Murphy, who was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2005, was vandalized in July 2018. A teenage boy was arrested after the stone engraved with Murphy\u2019s image was found smashed at a lake on New York\u2019s Long Island, Stars and Stripes reported at the time.\n\nAnd, finally, that image of graffiti covering rows of names? It\u2019s a Vietnam memorial in Venice, Calif., that was vandalized in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
