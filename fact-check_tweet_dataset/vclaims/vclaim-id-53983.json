The National Security Council confirmed in a tweet that text message rumors are fake.\n\nScreen grabs of text messages warning that the federal government plans to institute a national quarantine and martial law have been circulating on social media since at least March 15. (RELATED: Did Costco Recall Kirkland Toilet Paper Due To Coronavirus Contamination?)\n\nThis particular post attributes the warning to a boyfriend\u2019s dad working in the military and a friend\u2019s sister-in-law working at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Others posts credit \u201cmilitary friends,\u201d the \u201cDC mayor\u201d or \u201ca physician at the Clev. Clinic\u201d with similar warnings, according to FactCheck.org.\n\nThe National Security Council debunked these viral rumors in a March 15 tweet.\n\n\u201cText message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE,\u201d reads the tweet. \u201cThere is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus.\u201d\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio also took to Twitter to pour water on the claim the following day, calling the rumors \u201cCOMPLETELY FALSE.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop spreading stupid rumors about marshall (sic) law. COMPLETELY FALSE,\u201d Rubio tweeted. \u201cWe will continue to see closings & restrictions on hours of non-essential businesses in certain cities & states. But that is NOT marshall law.\u201d\n\nMartial law is defined as \u201cthe replacement of civil rule with temporary military authority in a time of crisis,\u201d according to the Military Times. But there is no evidence the federal government plans to enact such a measure for 30 days, and President Donald Trump has said he is not considering it at this time.\n\nThe claim of martial law seems to stem from Trump invoking the Stafford Act when he declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency on March 13. However, that federal disaster relief law actually empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist state and local governments in dealing with the outbreak and coordinate the country\u2019s response.", "lang": "en"}
