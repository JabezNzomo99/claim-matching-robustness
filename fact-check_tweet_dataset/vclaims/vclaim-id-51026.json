The article has been shared repeatedly in multiple Facebook posts on pages with thousands of followers. The claim in the posts is false; the man pictured has been wrongly identified as the suspect in the case; he told AFP he is the hospital's acting medical officer; the real suspect in the case has been remanded in custody until January 21, 2020.\n\nThis article was shared on a public Facebook page with more than 12,000 followers on January 8, 2020.\n\nIt features a photo of a man, circled in white, identifying him as a doctor arrested over alleged sex abuse of minors at a hospital in the Sri Lankan district of Ampara.\n\nThe Tamil-language caption on the Facebook post translates to English as: \u201cShameful act of Ampara doctors...shocking information that comes out regarding abuse of schoolgirls\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe report reads in part: \u201cA doctor attached to the Senarathpura Rural Hospital in Ugana Divisional Secretariat Division of the Sinhala village of Ampara District has been arrested by the police and placed under arrest.\n\n\u201cStudents from a nearby Sinhala school have gone to the hospital to receive a medical examination report for a sports competition.\n\n\u201cIt is reported that the doctor who tested them have abused them.\"\n\nThe article was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false. The man photographed in the article is the acting medical officer in charge of Senarathpura Hospital, where the alleged sex abuse occured, not the suspect.\n\nIn a phone conversation with AFP on January 10, 2020, Dr. Niroshana Liyanage said the photo in the article shows him. He said he was \u201cdisheartened\u201d by the way his photo had been used in news reports.\n\n\u201cIt was very disappointing to see some local news websites had used my photograph, carelessly identifying me as the doctor from the Senarathpura hospital who abused four minors. I left the service of this hospital in 2017, but have been overseeing the administration as the Acting Medical-Officer-in-Charge. The doctor who was arrested joined this hospital about three months ago,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the photo in circulation appears to have been taken from this post on the hospital\u2019s Facebook page of a staff meeting, published December 13, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading article (L) and the hospital\u2019s Facebook post (R):\n\nDuring the conversation with AFP, Liyanage said he has since filed a police report on January 10, 2020 against several local news websites for the unlawful use of his photo that has resulted in defamation.\n\nBelow is a photo of the police complaint receipt Liyanage has shared with AFP:\n\nAccording to this report by English-language Sri Lankan newspaper Colombo Gazette published Janury 7, 2020 a doctor was arrested for allegedly sexually abusing four minors at a hospital in Ampara.\n\nThis Sinhala-language report by the online news website Gossip Lanka News identifies the suspect as Milan Fernando, who was remanded in custody until January 21, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
