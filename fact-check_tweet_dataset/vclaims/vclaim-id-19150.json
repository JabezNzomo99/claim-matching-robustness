We have to eliminate all these people. These traitors, the sloganeering brigade, you think we have not given you chance? We now need to have a tough military option. And I\u2019m saying as a proud Indian, I am prepared for collateral damage. Kill thousands.\u201d\n\nWhile millions of people in Kashmir are under a military siege, Arnab Goswami says, \u201cAs a proud Indian, I am ready for collateral damage\u2026.kill them\u2026kill them in thousands\u201d. Prime Time journalists in India are baying for the blood of Kashmiris. #StandWithKashmir\n\nThe video was first put out by a Twitter handle \u2018With Kashmir (WithKashmir_)\u2018 but was later taken down (archive). It was shared with the caption \u2013 \u201cWhile millions of people in #Kashmir are under a military siege, Arnab Goswami says, \u201cAs a proud India, I am ready for collateral damage.\u201d\n\nThe video was quote-tweeted by several journalists, including Rituparna Chatterjee and Abhinandan Sekhri. The former has now deleted her tweet. @WithKashmir_\u2019s tweet was also retweeted by Anoo Bhuyan, Omar Waraich and Mahwash Ajaz.\n\nActress Gauhar Khan referred to the contents of the video in a recent tweet.\n\nThe video, while in context of Kashmir, was not broadcast after the government\u2019s decision to deem provisions of Article 370 ineffective. It was broadcast on February 24 after the Pulwama attack where panellists debated on the topic \u2013 \u201cWill Pro-Azadi Gang Unite Against Pakistan?\u201d\n\nIn the video below, Goswami can be heard saying at 1:07:47 onwards, \u201cI am saying that we now need to have a tough military option and I\u2019m saying as a proud Indian, I am prepared for collateral damage to take on terrorists within Jammu and Kashmir and their supporters because now operation elimination will start and we will have to eliminate all these people.\u201d At about 55:12, he says, \u201cKill thousands, kill them,\u201d with regard to stone-pelters in Kashmir. A little further into the debate Goswami suggests that the only solution for Kashmir is the use of force and strong military action. He also says that the sole fix for the problem of stone-pelters is to round them up, hold them by their hair and thrash them up.\n\nThe video doing rounds on social media, while replete with hate-filled and provocative language, is not recent and was broadcast post-Pulwama attack.", "lang": "en"}
