The claim is false; an electoral commission official issued a flat denial, labelling the claim \u201cnonsensical\u201d.\n\nA post on this Kenyan Facebook group with more than two million followers shared a link to the article alongside this text: \u201cPresident Museveni has postponed next Years Election to 2023 Due to CORONAVIRUS. We cannot Risk the life of millions of people of Uganda we will have our elections in 2023 - Museveni (sic)\u201d.\n\nAccording to the article, the Ugandan leader made the announcement during a press conference at his official residence.\n\nSimilar claims were made in other Facebook posts here, here, here, and here.\n\nSome online users appeared to believe the claims, commenting that it could be a ploy by Museveni -- who has ruled since 1986 -- to extend his term. He has already been endorsed by the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) for re-election.\n\nHowever, Museveni has made no such declaration.\n\nDon Wanyama, Museveni\u2019s press adviser, told AFP via phone that \u201cthe president does not have powers to postpone elections\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is silly, obviously. It is fake news,\u201d Wanyama said in dismissing the claims.\n\nUganda holds its general election every five years and according to electoral laws, a presidential election may be suspended in the event of war or a state of emergency. The law allows parliament to reschedule the date for the election.\n\nUganda's constitution gives the president the powers to declare a state of emergency.\n\nThe claim coincides with a petition filed in a Ugandan court by Abey Mgugu, a citizen who is pleading with the state to postpone next year\u2019s polls because of fears associated with the novel coronavirus, local media reports here. No response has been forthcoming from the government yet. Uganda has not reported any case of coronavirus and no official communication has been issued regarding next year\u2019s election.\n\nHowever, the president is set to address the nation regarding the coronavirus pandemic during the afternoon of Wednesday 18 March, 2020.\n\nJotham Taremwa, Electoral Commission spokesman, told AFP that the claims should be ignored, stating: \u201cThat is nonsense.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the president has the power to postpone elections or what the process for such an event would be, he said: \u201cI don't want to give any credit to discussing these false stories. Why should I? It is false.\u201d\n\nMuseveni, 75, got the clearance to run for the presidential seat after a bill that scrapped the presidential age limit of 75 was signed into law. This move by Uganda\u2019s parliament sparked demonstrations and an outcry from the opposition which accused the president of seeking to rule for life. Read AFP\u2019s report here.", "lang": "en"}
