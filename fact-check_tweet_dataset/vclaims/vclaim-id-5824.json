This claim is false. He in fact posted the photo in 2015, and both versions of it used in the claim have been digitally altered.\n\nRecent posts with the claim are visible here and here .\n\nThe text in the posts reads: \u201cThe left picture was posted by Tom Hanks on Facebook tonight to indicate that he is self-quarantined at home. The picture on the right was found on a Greek website in 2017. What. Is. Going. On. CREDIT: @RASINGBLEDSOES- thank you so much for this amazing find.\u201d The implication is that Hanks lied about self-isolating by recycling an old photograph, with comments including \u201cPeople think he\u2019s faking being sick\u201d, \u201cThey are playing us, people!\u201d and \u201cMaybe he\u2019s in custody right now.\u201d\n\nThe claim was originally posted on Instagram here on March 16, days after Hanks announced he and his wife Rita Wilson had tested positive for the coronavirus in Australia ( here ).\n\nThe original photo was actually posted by the actor on July 29, 2015 ( here , here ) and shows him wearing a jersey from the U.S. women's soccer team ( here ). The image has been subject to digital manipulation in the past ( here , here ).\n\nIn the claim, the image on the left features a fabricated Facebook post with the caption \u201cStaying home\u201d. Reuters did not find the alleged post on Hanks\u2019 page here . The t-shirt has been edited to include the logo of the campaign \u201cMenoume Spiti\u201d (\u201cWe Stay at Home\u201d) organized by the Greek Ministry of Health to promote social distancing ( menoumespiti.gr/ ).\n\nThe altered photo on the right was indeed uploaded on April 1, 2017 here on a website called MyGreekHeart. The disclaimer on the page reads: \u201cThis photo is not real and is simply hosted to celebrate April Fools\u2019 day 2017,\u201d showing that it was edited on purpose.\n\nHanks and public figures have recently being targets of misinformation as a result of the QAnon conspiracy theory that powerful celebrities are part of a sex trafficking ring ( here, here ).\n\nSee Reuters Fact Checks on similar claims here and here .\n\nAltered. The original photo was posted by Tom Hanks in 2015 and not in 2020. The claims feature a fabricated post and two manipulated photos.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
