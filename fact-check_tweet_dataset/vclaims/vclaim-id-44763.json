{"title": "No, LIC Staff Didn\u2019t Attempt Suicide Over PM\u2019s Call to Sell Stake", "subtitle": "A video showing a man attempting suicide is being widely circulated on social media with a claim that unhappy over Narendra Modi\u2019s decision to sell LIC company, an employee tries to attempt suicide in Surat, which is an old and unrelated video.", "author": "www.thequint.com", "date": "2020-02-03T21:11:27+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-44763", "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/lic-employee-kills-self-after-govt-sells-stake-no-video-is-old", "vclaim": "The video hasn\u2019t been doctored in any way, but the claim with which the video is being circulated is false. Firstly, it is from Madurai and not Gujarat, as the viral post claims, and the incident happened on 8 January 2020. Recalling his wife\u2019s suicide, after she was harassed by his parents, the man, identified as Shakti, climbed on to a nearby transformer and tried to kill himself. He had suffered some minor burns and is now out of danger.\n\nOn fragmenting the video into several keyframes and conducting a reverse search, we came across a news report by Tamil Web Dunia from 8 January 2020, which had reported on the incident. According to this article, the man, Shakti, is a soldier from Madurai. Taking a cue from there, we searched on Google with the keywords \u2018Madurai soldier attempts suicide Shakti\u2019. We, then, came across several reports by media outlets, including Times of India and DT Next, which state that Shakti attempted suicide due to domestic issues.\n\nShakti\u2019s wife, Thenisha, had consumed poison and died, following which a police inquiry was set up. When Shakti, along with his relatives, approached the Madurai Collectorate for the inquiry, fearing police action, Shakti attempted suicide. Evidently, the video being circulated is old and has nothing to do with the government selling its stake in LIC.", "lang": "en"}
