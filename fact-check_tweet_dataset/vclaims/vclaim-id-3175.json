In this case Russia in 2017 rated 51st by the IMF.\n\nIncreasing the PPC by 1.5 times in the next 7 years, if achieved, would make Russia equivalent to Japan, France, the United Kingdom or South Korea today.\n\nHowever, if the total GDP is estimated by the PPC, then the group of leaders, according to the same measures by the IMF, looks different.\n\nAs early as 2014, China advanced, according to this measure, with the U.S. topping the chart and Russia ranked 6th.\n\nBut, whichever of the two \u201cfive largest economies\u201d was meant by the report, the conversation is about the need to significantly speed up the pace of economic growth in Russia.\n\n\u201cWe need an economy with rates of growth higher than the global rates,\u201d said Putin. Today those rates are 2.5 times lower than the global rates.", "lang": "en"}
