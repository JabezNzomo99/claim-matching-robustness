A book, authored by Monika Arora, Sonali Chitalkar and Prerna Malhotra, on the violence that gripped the national capital in February claims to be a \u201cserious document of intense research\u201d which needs to be \u201cseriously studied by the Government of India\u201d. The book ran into trouble when its initial publisher Bloomsbury pulled the plug on it, as a massive debate on its veracity erupted online. We at The Quint have accessed and scanned the Bloomsbury draft of the book and found that far from being based on a \u201cfact-finding mission\u201d it is replete with factual errors, unsubstantiated claims, and conspiracy theories.

Former IPS officer PC Dogra, in his foreword, relies on a falsely attributed quote of Jawaharlal Nehru to say that he called himself \u2018Muslim by culture and Hindu only by accident of birth\u2019.

No, Viral Claim is False Several users on social media have claimed that the Supreme Court has changed its motto from \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019 to \u2018Yato Dharma Tato Jaya\u2019 as can be seen in the collegium's statement released on 17 August regarding the elevation of six advocates to judges of the Delhi High Court. However, the SC's logo has always included the motto \u2018Yato Dharma Tato Jaya\u2019, while that of the Government of India and High Courts reads \u2018Satyamev Jayate\u2019. It hasn't been changed recently.

However, we found that while the brawl happened, it had no communal angle and took place between members of the same family. You can read the story here.\n\n4. MP Govt\u2019s Old Ad Against Wearing Masks Revived Out of Context A public health advisory issued by the Madhya Pradesh government and the National Health Mission in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was in its early stages, is now being revived without the context that its advice against wearing masks was before the guidance was changed by health bodies. At the beginning of the pandemic, several health bodies across the world had a similar take on wearing masks, saying that only those who were sick or taking care of a sick person were required to wear masks. The advice was also coming in light of a sudden shortage of masks as people rushed to buy them when COVID-19 hit. You can read the story here.\n\n5. Mojo\u2019s Video of Cop Beating Boy is 8 Months Old? No, Fake Claim! Many on social media are claiming that a video of a policeman on a road beating a boy with a stick is eight months old and that the boy is a chain snatcher and had attacked the cops as well. They are reacting to a video of the incident which was uploaded by media outlet Mojo. An archived version of this post can be seen here. However, in a press release, Delhi Police has said that the incident is from the intervening night of 22-23 August. They have also lodged an enquiry into the conduct of the policeman seen in the video.", "lang": "en"}
