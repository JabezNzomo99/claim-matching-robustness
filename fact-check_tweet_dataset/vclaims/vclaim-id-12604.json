He said its purpose was to teach the basics of China\u2019s Mandarin language to police officers who work at community service centres in Eastern Cape police stations.\n\nTonjeni said the Mandarin learning programme started in 2016, but the centre itself only opened on 28 October 2018, the day the photos of commissioner Liziwe Ntshinga and the Chinese Embassy staff were taken.\n\nJie Zhang, the head of the centre, said it was a nonprofit organisation working to improve relationships between the police, local communities and Chinese people living in the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality.\n\n\u201c[The centre] is focused on the safety of Chinese nationals and being a platform for good relations with police to assist Chinese nationals because there is a huge language barrier,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn our centre, we have colleagues who work 24/7 who know English and Chinese.

But also, the policing forums themselves have not been as proactive as they could be in terms of communicating with the rest of the country exactly what their work is.\u201d -\n\nEastern Cape province\u2019s police commissioner Liziwe Ntshinga (top left) at the opening of the new Chinese Community and Police Cooperation Centre in Port Elizabeth on 28 October 2018.
