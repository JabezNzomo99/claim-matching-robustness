If you put up a solar plant, what do you when the sky is cloudy?\"\n\nAquino, however, was not referring to the windmills of Ilocos. He made the statement in reference to the Supreme Court's 2012 ruling to temporarily halt the $1.28 billion coal plant project in Subic.\n\nFacebook group Solid Duterte-Marcos Supporters and Facebook page The News Gear shared the story a day after Sen. Richard Gordon released a report recommending graft charges be filed against Aquino for his role in the Dengvaxia vaccine controversy.\n\nEditor's note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.", "lang": "en"}
