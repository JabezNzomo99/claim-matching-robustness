But that doesn\u2019t make such attack-snippets any more accurate.\n\nTelemundo Reporter: What did the gubernatorial candidate of Virginia say? Ken Cuccinelli: It is worse than our immigration policy. You can\u2019t break up rat families\u2026and you can\u2019t even kill \u2018em. Narrator: What type of person would say that? A person we just can\u2019t trust. Ken Cuccinelli. He\u2019s focused on his own agenda \u2013 not us.\n\nIn a call to conservative radio show The Morning Majority (WMAL 105.9 FM) in early 2012, Cuccinelli waded into a debate about D.C.\u2019s Wildlife Protection Act of 2010, one of the toughest wildlife laws in the nation. We won\u2019t rehash a debate about whether his claims about the law were accurate, but WTOP (103.5 FM) did an interesting fact check in which it concluded that many of his claims were actually false.\n\nCuccinelli: Well, I saw the same rat story about D.C. that y\u2019all have been talking about. What you may not know is that last year, in its finite wisdom, the D.C. City Council passed a new law, or a triumph of animal rights over human health, where those pest control people you suggested they bring in aren\u2019t allowed to kill the rats. They have to relocate the rats and not only that \u2014 that\u2019s actually not the worst part \u2014 they cannot break up the families of the rats. Now, as actual experts in pest control will tell you, if you don\u2019t move an animal at least 25 miles, it\u2019ll come back. And so what\u2019s the solution to that? Well, cross a river. Host: Send \u2019em over to Virginia, that\u2019s right. Cuccinelli: Guess why I care about that sort of thing? Cuccinelli: Anyway, it is worse than our immigration policy \u2014 you can\u2019t break up rat families. Or raccoons or all the rest and you can\u2019t even kill them. It\u2019s unbelievable.\n\nThe reference to immigration policy appears to be a poor attempt at humor. Certainly Cuccinelli appears to suggest he thinks it is appropriate to break up immigrant families, and one might question why he thinks of immigrants when he is discussing rodent issues. But is he really \u201ccomparing immigration policy to exterminating rats,\u201d as the ad claims?\n\nThe Huffington Post article had this headline: \u201cKen Cuccinelli Once Compared Immigration Policy To Pest Control, Exterminating Rats.\u201d But the article doesn\u2019t back up the inflammatory headline. It simply says he made \u201ca comparison\u201d but never states that he said that immigration policy was like exterminating rats.\n\n\u201cHe says the pest control policy is worse than our immigration policy, because you can\u2019t break up the families and you can\u2019t even kill them. How else can one read/hear that statement other than a comparison between immigration policy and pest control?\u201d Coy said. \u201cIn the full context of his statements, Cuccinelli compares how rat families are treated in D.C. to how immigrant families are treated under current policy (and seems to prefer the policy of breaking families up). That\u2019s the point we convey in the ad.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli\u2019s reference to immigration policy may have been inappropriate, but it\u2019s still a stretch to claim that he was comparing it to \u201cexterminating rats.\u201d The actual sentence in question is about breaking up rat families, not extermination. And the full context of the conversation shows that the reference to immigration policy was a throw-away line, not part of a substantive discussion on immigration policy.", "lang": "en"}
