The same photo is also being shared (archived) as that of Delhi. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of a family having their tea while sitting in flood water in Surat, Gujarat. Fact: The photo is captured in Mansa (Punjab), not Surat (Gujarat). Also, the photo is old and is taken in 2016. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we subjected the photo to reverse image search technique, a tweet of Barnala constituency (Punjab) MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer was found. The tweet is dated \u201818 July 2016\u2019 and it is mentioned in the tweet that the photo is captured at Mansa district of Punjab.\n\nIn the comments section of that tweet, a user attached a news article from the e-paper of \u2018Punjab Kesari\u2019 that had the same photo as that in the post. The article also mentioned that the photo was taken in \u2018Mansa\u2019.\n\nOther Facebook posts mentioning that the photo is taken at \u2018Mansa\u2019 can be seen here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, an old photo of a family from Mansa (Punjab) having their tea while sitting in flood water is being shared as in Surat (Gujarat).\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
