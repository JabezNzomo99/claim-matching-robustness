White House press pool reports also place him at the White House.\n\nDelta Force commandos executed a nighttime raid in northwestern Syria on Oct. 26 that resulted in the death of al-Baghdadi. The ISIS leader retreated to a tunnel beneath his compound and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children. No Americans were killed in the operation.\n\nTrump announced the result of the mission in a press conference the following day.\n\n\u201cLast night, the United States brought the world\u2019s number one terrorist leader to justice,\u201d said the president. \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.\u201d\n\nDuring a question-and-answer session with reporters at the press conference, Trump said he watched the raid from the Situation Room at the White House, noting it was \u201cas though you were watching a movie.\u201d\n\nSome, including Palmer Report and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, alleged that the president was playing golf at the time that the raid occurred. But, according to the timeline of events reported by numerous media outlets, this claim is untrue.\n\nThe Washington Post, The New York Times, and Reuters all place Trump at the White House at the time of the raid. So do White House pool reports.

The Washington Post and Reuters reported that Trump was present in the Situation Room around 5 p.m., when the raid approximately began.\n\nIndeed, a photograph released by the White House shows Trump and military advisors in the Situation Room, appearing to watch the raid unfold. Metadata from the picture dates it to 5:06 p.m., according to The Washington Post.\n\nHelicopters carrying U.S. special forces operators departed from a military base in Iraq at roughly the same time \u2014 5 p.m. EDT \u2014 and arrived at the al-Baghdadi compound around 6:10 p.m., according to several media outlets. By 7:15 p.m., al-Baghdadi\u2019s remains had been recovered, and he was confirmed dead. The operation lasted approximately two hours, according to Reuters.\n\nA tweet from Pete Souza, the former chief White House photographer under former President Barack Obama who took the now-famous bin Laden raid photograph, suggested the mission had taken place at 3:30 p.m., citing inaccurate early reports. That tweet, which garnered more than 38,000 likes, appears to have spurred the incorrect claim that Trump was playing golf at the time.\n\nSouza later corrected his alleged timeline of events, but did not delete his original tweet containing the erroneous information.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
