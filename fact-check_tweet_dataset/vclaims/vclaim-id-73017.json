A video accusing Gates of wanting \"to eliminate 15 percent of the population\" through vaccination and electronic microchips has racked up nearly two million views on YouTube.\n\nSince the start of the crisis, AFP Fact Check has debunked dozens of anti-Gates rumours circulating on platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram in languages including English, French, Spanish, Polish and Czech.\n\nA number of accusations, including posts claiming that the FBI arrested Gates for biological terrorism or that he supports a Western plot to poison Africans, share a common thread.\n\nThey accuse the tycoon of exploiting the crisis, whether it is to \"control people\" or make money from selling vaccines.\n\n\"These conspiracies are powerful enough to drive down institutional trust around health organisations, and as a result, possibly drive down vaccination rates, which is worrying,\" Smith said.\n\nGates' vocal criticism of US President Donald Trump and support for vaccine development made him \"the perfect scapegoat for a crisis that emerges on the intersection of technology and (medical) science,\" Kinga Polynczuk-Alenius, a social sciences researcher at Finland's University of Helsinki, wrote in a university blog post.\n\nIt is not the first time Gates has found himself at the mercy of conspiracy theorists. When Zika virus broke out in 2015 in Brazil, he was one of several powerful Western figures blamed for the disease. Other rumours claim that he is secretly a lizard, an old favourite among online trolls.\n\n\"He hasn't become conspiracists' favourite target, he has been (their favourite target) for a long time,\" Sylvain Delouv\u00e9e, a social psychology researcher at France's University of Rennes, told AFP.\n\nThe recent explosion in false claims could be explained as a coping mechanism during the global crisis, Smith said.\n\n\"People are constantly looking for information to make sense out of this reality, and having these conspiracies offers a convenient way of having power over your situation,\" he said.\n\nThe pandemic has also provided fertile breeding ground for attacks on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, particularly by anti-vaccine campaigners whose influential online presence was already brewing years before the virus emerged.\n\nThe charity's humanitarian work in Africa, where misinformation about Gates is particularly present, and financial support of the World Health Organization -- it is the agency's second-largest donor -- have fed rumours of dark secrets and ploys for power.\n\nSeveral widely shared posts point to photographs of Gates attending a \"coronavirus conference\" in 2015. Conclusion? He predicted the pandemic.\n\nIn reality, he was meeting with a research institute that had filed for a patent to potentially be used for a vaccine against a different type of coronavirus that affects animals.\n\nLike many scientists, Gates had already warned of an imminent pandemic years before the novel coronavirus outbreak.\n\nGates has also come under attack from celebrities.\n\nConservative US television host Laura Ingraham claimed in a tweet that Gates was developing \"tracking\" mechanisms. She was referring to a widely misinterpreted Reddit post by the billionaire about \"digital certificates\" to show who has recovered, been tested or -- eventually -- vaccinated.\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr, the anti-Trump, anti-vaccine nephew of the former American president John F Kennedy, has accused the philanthropist of dictating global health policies. \"We are his guinea pigs,\" he wrote in an Instagram post attacking the entrepreneur.\n\nMeanwhile, French \"Chocolat\" actress Juliette Binoche sparked controversy when she blasted Gates on Instagram and called for the rejection of \"a microchip implant for all\".\n\nDebunking misinformation is \"not about saying that everyone is a good guy\", said Delouvee at France's University of Rennes, pointing to privacy concerns around the race to build coronavirus tracking apps and governments' use of medical data.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has come under fire in publications such as The Lancet medical journal, which accused it of a lack of transparency over its financial investments.\n\nHere are our fact checks in English on claims circulating about Bill Gates during the pandemic.\n\nBill Gates did not say COVID-19 vaccine could kill nearly a million people\n\nMisleading Facebook post claims Bill Gates wants to introduce 'digital tattoos' to check who has been tested\n\nVideo falsely purports to show a protest over a new Bill Gates vaccine\n\nDoctored photo claims to show Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's \"Center for Global Human Population Reduction\" (which does not exist)\n\nYou can find more fact checks, tips and resources in our COVID-19 verification hub.", "lang": "en"}
