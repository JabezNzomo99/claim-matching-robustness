Incidentally, a blog, 24Reports, published on April 1 that the president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari has dismissed his Chief of Staff. Apparently, Buhari made this decision owing to Abba Kyari\u2019s COVID-19 status, according to this blog. Per the report, Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, broke the news. The report quoted him thus:\n\nNews of Abba Kyari\u2019s COVID-19 status is currently mainstream. He reportedly developed symptoms days after he arrived from his trip to Germany; subsequently going for a test which came out positive. After confirming his COVID-19 status, rumour had it that Abba Kyari was sneaked out of the country for treatment along with the president.\n\nHowever, Dubawa\u2019s findings revealed this was false. The check further confirmed that the duo was present in the country. While Kyari was receiving treatments in Lagos, no evidence suggested the president was infected with the virus.\n\nThere has been no credible news publication that speaks to the removal or replacement of Abba Kyari.\n\nMeanwhile, it seems this claim has been making the rounds on WhatsApp prior to blog publication. President Buhari\u2019s personal assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmaad attested to this in a tweet where he debunks the claim. He further advised the public to disregard and dishonour the viral claim. Another iteration names Alhaji Babagana as Kyari\u2019s replacement.\n\nBesides, other verification platforms such as CDD also rated this false. So why does this conjecture persist? Well, evidently falsehoods persist post verification; thus buttressing the need for the repetition and emphasis of truth and facts! Hence, we advise that before you share anything be sure it is not fake news and when in doubt, don\u2019t share.", "lang": "en"}
