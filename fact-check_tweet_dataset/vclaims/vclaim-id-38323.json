The claim is false and such an order would require a special proclamation from the country's president.\n\nA Facebook post shared more than 160 times and archived here warns people that the Zambian army is enforcing a 9:00 pm curfew.\n\nAn image that appears to show soldiers being transported on the back of military vehicles is included in the poorly written post.\n\nA screenshot taken on February 24, 2020 of the misleading Facebook post\n\nThose who ignore the curfew risk being taken to \"military jail\", according to the claim.\n\nALSO READ: Articles Falsely Claim Canada To Welcome 3 Million Immigrants In 2020\n\nVariations of the claim appear here and here on Facebook.
