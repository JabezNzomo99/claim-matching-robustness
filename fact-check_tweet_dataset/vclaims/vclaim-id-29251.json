Our readers have also asked us to look into these claims.\n\nThe claims describe Article 24 as a WTO trading rule which will allow the UK to temporarily carry on trading with the EU under the current zero-tariff system even if we leave the EU\u2019s customs union and single market on WTO terms.\n\nBut it\u2019s not that simple and experts have said this is unlikely to happen. That\u2019s because Article 24 only allows countries negotiating a free-trade area or customs union to have an \u201cinterim\u201d agreement in place (which in the case of the UK and EU could allow tariff-free trade to continue) provided they have a \u201cplan and schedule\u201d agreed for what their final deal will look like. The EU would also have to agree to this plan before we leave the EU.\n\nWhere does the claim come from?\n\nThis claim has had a long shelf-life. The earliest instances we could find of \u2018Article 24\u2019 being mentioned in connection with the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU were from news reports around March 2017.\n\nIn February 2018, the pro-Brexit group of Conservative MPs known as the European Research Group wrote a letter to Theresa May suggesting how Brexit could be best achieved ahead of negotiations with the EU.\n\nThis included the following: \u201cAny \u2018implementation period\u2019 should be based on WTO principles. Any implementation period must not restrain the UK from negotiating or signing other trade agreements. Legally, that means it should be an interim period in contemplation of a free trade agreement, compliant with GATT Article 24 (7) b.\u201d\n\nSince then it\u2019s been raised as a possibility by a number of politicians, including prominent Leave campaigners.\n\nIts proponents argue that in a situation where we leave the single market and customs union and begin trading with the EU on WTO terms, we could then begin a trade deal negotiation with the EU. This negotiation, the argument goes, would be conducted during an \u201cinterim period\u201d\u2014asset out in Article 24\u2014that could last up to ten years and allows us to maintain tariff-free trade with the EU.\n\nAs we\u2019ve looked at before, if we leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement we will automatically begin trading with it on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms.\n\nThe precursor to the World Trade Organisation was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) agreed in 1948. The GATT still forms the basis of most of the WTO\u2019s rules on trade today and it is Article 24 of this agreement to which people have been referring.\n\nGenerally Article 24 sets out the rules under which a customs union or free-trade area can be created between WTO members.\n\nFor countries that want to create free-trade areas or a customs union, but haven\u2019t yet concluded the final deal, Article 24 allows them to put in place an interim arrangement. During this interim period, Article 24 says that tariffs and regulations can \u201cnot on the whole be higher or more restrictive\u201d than before the interim agreement (there are currently no tariffs on trade between the UK and EU). These countries can only put such an interim agreement in place if they have a \u201cplan and a schedule\u201d to form the free-trade area or customs union within \u201ca reasonable length of time\u201d.\n\nFurther on in Article 24 it says that a reasonable length of time \u201cshould exceed 10 years only in exceptional cases\u201d.\n\nThe House of Commons Library says that \u201cThis recognises the fact that a customs union or a free-trade agreement cannot be concluded rapidly and might need gradual implementation. It is this idea that those promoting [Article 24] have in mind.\u201d\n\nSo could we leave on WTO terms and keep tariff-free trade under Article 24?\n\nAlmost certainly not.\n\nThe Article 24 plan is possible in theory, but very unlikely in practice. Article 24 does not remove the need to strike a deal with the EU.\n\nBoth the UK and the EU would have to reach an agreement about going into such an interim period\u2014the UK couldn\u2019t make the decision by itself\u2014and they\u2019d also need to agree on what the \u201cplan and schedule\u201d for the final deal would look like.\n\nArticle 24 also says that the future agreement must cover the \u201cduties and other restrictive regulations of commerce\u201d of \u201csubstantially all the trade\u201d between the countries involved. Other members of the WTO could also ask for changes to the agreement if they have concerns about it.\n\nThis would all need to be agreed before we leave the EU. Experts have said such an agreement is unlikely.\n\nWithout such an agreement, or some kind of withdrawal agreement as proposed by the government being in place, the UK will leave the EU and being trading with it on WTO terms\u2014meaning tariffs on trade.\n\nArticle 24 itself only covers trade, so other elements we might want to include in any future deal with the EU, services for instance, wouldn\u2019t be covered under Article 24 or the GATT, it would be under separate agreements.\n\nThe government has weighed in on the issue too\n\nIt has said the suggestion we could use Article 24 \u201cis a misunderstanding of what the rules are\u201d.\n\nDr Liam Fox, the Secretary of State for International Trade, said in the House of Commons on January 14: \u201cThere are two immediate problems facing that suggestion. The first is that it would require the agreement of the EU and be based on the expectation of a future trade agreement or customs union to be operable in WTO law. Although it might be argued, as I am sure many in the House [of Commons] would, that that would be in the economic interests of the EU27, we all know from experience that the politics of the EU can take precedence over economic pragmatism. In the political atmosphere of no deal, it would be difficult to cultivate the good will necessary for that to proceed. Secondly, that suggestion would not deal with all the regulatory issues\u2014the non-tariff barriers\u2014that are so important to many businesses.\u201d\n\nWhy can\u2019t we just have no deal and zero tariffs with the EU?\n\nIt would be possible for the UK to unilaterally remove or reduce tariffs on any or all EU goods without an agreement post-Brexit. But because of WTO rules known as \u2018Most Favoured Nation\u2019 the UK would then have to do the same for all other countries. Even if we did do this there would be no guarantee that the EU would do the same in return.\n\nOn 13 March the government published its plans for temporary tariffs in the event of a no deal Brexit. They would remove tariffs from \u201c87% of total imports to the UK by value\u201d, according to the government\u2019s figures, but would apply tariffs to some categories of imports, including some food products, vehicles and fuel. This would last for up to 12 months, and we don\u2019t know what tariffs the EU might place on goods imported from the UK to the EU.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about how the WTO works here.", "lang": "en"}
