This video has been manipulated. It combines Hilary Clinton\u2019s endorsement video from August 28, in which Joe Biden is seen looking down for several seconds, with a video of the singer Harry Belafonte appearing to fall asleep on live TV in 2011.\n\nThe posts, shared over 13,000 times ( here , here , here , here , here , here ), are often accompanied by the text, \u201cJoe Biden is asleep during live interview.\u201d The video starts with a TV presenter saying, \u201cjoining us live this morning from New York\u201d, and then moves to a shot of Joe Biden who appears to have his eyes shut, and the TV presenter saying \u201cwake up,\u201d with a snoring noise in the background.\n\nThe clip of the TV presenter is from 2011, when then 84-year-old singer Harry Belafonte appeared to fall asleep live on air on KBAK, a California TV station. The video can be seen here . Ken Sunshine, Harry Belafonte\u2019s spokesperson made a statement at the time, blaming the incident on a technical issue: \u201cThere was a technical glitch in the feed to a local station in Bakersfield, CA. His earpiece wasn\u2019t working, so he decided to take the time to meditate before the rest of his Day-O.\u201d (here) There is no snoring sound on this clip.\n\nThe video of Biden is taken from former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton\u2019s endorsement of Joe Biden on August 28 2020 (here). Several times during the endorsement video, Biden appears to either be looking down or to have his eyes shut for a few seconds, before looking back up at the camera. At one point Biden has his eyes down for 14 seconds (here), but there is no evidence to suggest Biden was asleep during that time.\n\nThe sound of snoring has been added to the edited video, as has the text reading, \u201cOn air: Joe Biden, The importance of this election.\u201d\n\nTwitter user @damonimani (twitter.com/damonimani) confirmed to Reuters he created the edited video. In a tweet, he explains that he added the sound effects and mixed the two videos (here) and told Reuters, \u201cI\u2019m an artist with a wild imagination that I put into my parodies,\u201d confirming the creation was intended as a joke.\n\nWhile some users understood the video was satirical, others did not. Some comments include, \u201cthis is your candidate you crazy libs (sic),\u201d \u201che cannot run America,\u201d and \u201cif elected this will define his presidency!\u201d Others questioned fact checks pointing out the video\u2019s edited nature, with one user saying \u201c\u201dNow they say the video is altered. All they want to do is cover it up. Pathetic!!\u201d\n\nAltered. Joe Biden did not fall asleep on air, this video has been edited.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
