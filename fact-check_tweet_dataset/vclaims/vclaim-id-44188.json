Fox News has not reported that Trump tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe video, posted on May 18, shows footage of the White House, along with a chyron that reads, \u201cTrump tests positive for COVID-19.\u201d (RELATED: Did An MSNBC Reported Say, \u2018I Hope Enough People Die From Coronavirus That It Harms Trump\u2019s Re-Election\u2019?)\n\n\u201cBrought to you just a moment ago, Fox News alert: the White House medical team confirming President Donald Trump has confirmed positive for the coronavirus,\u201d a news anchor can be heard saying. \u201cThe White House just put out a statement.\u201d\n\nThrough a keyword search, the Daily Caller found the original clip published on Fox News\u2019 official YouTube channel on May 7. A comparison of the two videos revealed that the Facebook clip has been deceptively edited.The original segment, which features anchor Sandra Smith, discusses how one of Trump\u2019s personal valets tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nIn the Facebook video, the words \u201ca valet to\u201d have been cut out of Smith\u2019s delivery to make it seem like the president, rather than the valet, tested positive. The word \u201cvalet\u201d has also been digitally removed from the Fox News chyron, which actually read, \u201cTrump valet tests positive for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nShortly after the valet tested positive, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for the coronavirus, The Associated Press reported May 7. Trump more recently told reporters on May 21 that he had tested \u201cpositively toward negative\u201d in his daily coronavirus test that morning, according to The Hill.\n\nThere is no record of Fox News reporting that the president had tested positive for COVID-19.", "lang": "en"}
