This is false; Pompeo did not make these comments, and the US Diplomatic Mission in Nigeria says the posts are \u201cmanufactured content\u201d. Abubakar has also never been formally charged with any offence in the United States.\n\nThe most shared version of the post, bearing a photo of Pompeo, is captioned: \u201cBREAKING NEWS : I personally refused to meet him or have anything to do with him (Atiku). I am really surprised that an individual indicted in the United States of America of huge corruption is being considered for Nigeria President and citizens are even supporting him - U. S Secretary of State, Michael R. Pompeo.\u201d\n\nOthers were posted here and here.\n\nThe posts attempt to play on Abubakar\u2019s recent visit to the United States, which was intended to disprove rumours that he was unable to travel because of the corruption charges. In January, Atiku visited Washington and met some congressmen, but not the secretary of state.\n\nThe US mission in Nigeria said the comments were not made by Pompeo, describing them as \u201cmanufactured content\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nPompeo called Atiku and Buhari less than 24 hours before the initial election date on February 16 seeking a fair and peaceful vote, according to a statement from the US State Department.\n\nAbubakar, Nigeria\u2019s vice-president from 1999 to 2007, is the chief challenger to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari in the February 23 presidential election.\n\nHe has faced many allegations of corruption and abuse of public office, but has denied any wrongdoing, stating that he has never been indicted of corruption in Nigeria or elsewhere.", "lang": "en"}
