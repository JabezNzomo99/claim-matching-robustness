Jerry Brown claimed: \"two million new jobs have been created,\" in California since 2011.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of new employment, we thought, especially for a state ranked by some as having the nation\u2019s , thanks to high taxes and regulation.\n\nBrown has staked his legacy, at least during his second stint in the governor\u2019s office, largely on what he calls the \"California comeback.\"\n\nWe decided to fact check his claim about job creation, which is a big part of that comeback.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2010, California lost more than when the state\u2019s housing and construction sectors collapsed.\n\nThe loss of tax revenue and past skimpy savings meant multi-billion dollar budget shortfalls for California. It also meant heavy cuts in services for the poor, shuttering state parks and allowing levees, bridges and highways to crumble.\n\nIn his speech at the state Capitol, Brown took some credit for the financial turnaround, noting that he\u2019s helped pay down huge debts and create the state\u2019s Rainy Day Fund.\n\nHe didn\u2019t take all the credit for the new jobs.\n\n\"Two million new jobs have been created and unemployment has dropped in half,\" since 2011, he said in his record 14th State of the State address. \"Of course, the global recovery has a lot to do with that. So, we should applaud, but we can\u2019t control it, too.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll leave the global impact on California\u2019s recovery as a question for another day. Our focus is on Brown\u2019s comment that \"two million jobs have been created\" since 2011, the year he returned to the governor\u2019s office, and more than two decades after his initial stretch as the state\u2019s top executive.\n\nSifting through jobs data can be dizzying. And there are many ways to look at the numbers.\n\nFor some guidance, we turned to Chapman University economist Esmael Adibi, who tracks state employment.\n\nAdibi pointed to \"nonfarm payroll jobs\" by the state and federal governments. Economists consider that category the most reliable because it eliminates farm employment, which fluctuates considerably. Everyone in the nonfarm category is listed on a payroll and considered an employee.\n\nData from that category show that California had 14,301,300 nonfarm jobs in January 2011, when Brown\u2019s third term started.\n\nA released the day after Brown\u2019s address shows the state had more than 16,320,100 of those jobs in December 2015.\n\nThat\u2019s a growth of just over two million jobs.\n\nExperts we spoke with said this is a \u2018net job creation\u2019 total. And because many jobs were also lost during this period, the gross number of positions created would have been well over two million.\n\n\"I believe the governor is correct,\" Adibi told us. \"The economy actually has done pretty good during his leadership.\"\n\nFor some perspective, the two million jobs created in California accounts for about one-sixth of the nation\u2019s net 12.4 million jobs added during the same period, according to\n\nIt\u2019s also roughly 600,000 more jobs than Texas added during the same period, the show. Texas officials, including former Gov. Rick Perry, have made repeated efforts to siphon jobs away from the Golden State.\n\nAsked for the source of information for the California governor\u2019s job creation claim, the Brown Administration pointed to the same non-farm payroll data as Adibi.\n\nIn his State of the State address, Gov. Jerry Brown said \"two million jobs have been created\" in California since 2011.\n\nThe most reliable data used by both independent economists and the Brown Administration show California had about 14.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs when the governor returned to office in January 2011 and just over 16.3 million jobs last month. That\u2019s a net growth of more than two million jobs.", "lang": "en"}
