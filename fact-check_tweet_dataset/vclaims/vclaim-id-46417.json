Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nOn doing Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was not found in the search results. But it was found that a similar photo was tweeted by Priyanka Gandhi in 2019 with the text \u2013 \u2018Morning puja on the day of my wedding (22 years ago)\u2019. When searched with keywords, an India Today article on \u2018Priyanka Gandhi-Robert Vadra wedding\u2019 can be found in the search results. In the article, it can be read that \u2018the same priest that married her grandmother will grace this occasion too\u2019. But no details about the priest were given. In the \u2018Daily O\u2019 article, it was written that \u2018the family priest, Iqbal Kishan Reu, performed the rites\u2019. So, when searched with that name on Google, an article on the \u2018Kashmiri Pandit Network\u2019 website was found. In the article, it can be read that Pandit Iqbal Kishen Reu was a practising Kul Purohit and performed the marriage of Priyanka Gandhi with Robert Vadra according to Kashmiri Pandit\u2019s traditions. More articles regarding the marriage can be found here and here.\n\nThe \u2018Alt News\u2019 had also spoken to an ex-journalist and confirmed that the man in the photo is Iqbal Kishan Reu, a Kashmiri Pandit, not a maulana. More photos from the puja event were posted by multiple users on social media, which can be found here.\n\nTo sum it up, the man in this Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s wedding photo is neither a maulana nor MP Shafiqur Rahman Barq. He is Iqbal Kishan Reu, a Kashmiri Pandit.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
