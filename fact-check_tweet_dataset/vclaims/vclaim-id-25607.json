Below is the screenshot of the WhatsApp forward.\n\nTwitter user Shivam Maurya posted another video of the same incident with a similar narrative.\n\nAlt News was unable to locate any credible news reports about the incident. However, the license plate of a motorcycle visible in the video hinted that the incident took place in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Unnao district.\n\nOn checking a publically available data of vehicle registration in India, we found that the vehicle is registered under the name of one Pankaj Kumar Tripathi. We then Google searched with keywords, \u201c\u092a\u0902\u0915\u091c \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092a\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0935 \u201c, and found an article on a website circle.page.\n\nOn August 23, a father, along with his three sons and a relative, was searching for his missing son and was beaten up by a mob over false suspicion of child-lifting. The incident took place in UP\u2019s Unnao district. Moreover, we found one more article on the incident published by a news website Manvadhikar Media. A 65-year-old resident of Unnao town Gaya Prasad Tripathi along with his family members had gone to Dharmapur village to search for his missing son Munesh, according to the report. They were looking for him in a forest while their vehicles were parked on the road. When they inquired with the villagers about Prasad\u2019s missing son, they were mistaken for child-kidnappers. In a complaint given to the police, Prasad said that a missing complaint of his son was filed at Maurawan police station. Purwa police have lodged an FIR against unidentified people.\n\nAlt News contacted Purwa police station to inquire about the claims circulating on social media. We were informed that these men were not child-kidnappers and a case has been filed against some unidentified men.\n\nIn conclusion, a video where family members looking for their missing kin were falsely accused of child-lifting and beaten up by a mob in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, is circulating on social media to give credence to the false rumour.", "lang": "en"}
