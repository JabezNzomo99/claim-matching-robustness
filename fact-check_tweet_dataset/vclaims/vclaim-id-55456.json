You Have A Body\u2019?", "subtitle": "", "author": "checkyourfact.com", "date": "2019-09-18T18:31:17.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-55456", "url": "http://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/18/fact-check-cs-lewis-soul-body-quote/", "vclaim": "A post shared on Facebook alleges that Christian apologist C.S. Lewis once said, \u201cYou do not have a soul. You are a soul. You have a body.\u201d\n\nThis saying does not appear anywhere in C.S. Lewis\u2019s collected works.\n\nC.S. Lewis, widely regarded as an influential 20th century writer and theologian, is perhaps best known for his fantasy novel series \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia,\u201d which has since been adapted for the big screen. He also wrote extensively about religious matters in works like \u201cThe Problem of Pain\u201d and \u201cReflections on the Psalms.\u201d\n\nHowever, nowhere in his writings or \u201cThe Quotable Lewis,\u201d a book that contains more than 1,500 verified quotes, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to Lewis in the Facebook post. The C.S. Lewis Foundation includes the saying on a section of its website labeled \u201cQuotes Misattributed to C.S. Lewis.\u201d\n\nThe DCNF reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the expression originated with Lewis. Other experts, like \u201cThe Misquotable C.S. Lewis\u201d author William O\u2019Flaherty, have also debunked it online.\n\nThe quote may actually originate with Scottish author and minister George MacDonald, according to O\u2019Flaherty. In his 1867 book \u201cAnnals of a Quiet Neighborhood,\u201d MacDonald wrote a similar expression, \u201cThey ought to be taught that they have bodies; and that their bodies die; while they themselves live on \u2026 that we talk as if we POSSESSED souls, instead of BEING souls.\u201d\n\nA monthly journal called \u201cThe British Friend\u201d later attributed a shorter version of the quote to MacDonald in an 1892 article. That truncated version, O\u2019Flaherty theorizes, was subsequently associated with Lewis, who enjoyed MacDonald\u2019s work.\n\nYet, while there is no evidence that Lewis coined the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post, he did discuss the relationship between the soul and the body in his writing. In \u201cLetters to Malcolm,\u201d for example, Lewis wrote, \u201cAt present we tend to think of the soul as somehow \u2018inside\u2019 the body. But the glorified body of the resurrection as I conceive it \u2013 the sensuous life raised from its death \u2013 will be inside the soul.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
