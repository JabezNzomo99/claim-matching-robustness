As part of that document, the campaign tried to anticipate the types of attacks that might be aimed at her by Republicans. The document said some were generic to all Democratic Senate candidates (\u201ctoo liberal\u201d) while others dealt with Nunn\u2019s record, including her tenure at Points of Light. The reason for identifying these potential attacks was so the campaign could prepare \u201cpushback\u201d materials to answer the charges, which is standard operating procedure for any serious campaign.\n\nIn other words, the document was not saying that she funded organizations linked to terrorists, only that she might be attacked by Republicans on this issue. So it\u2019s pretty cyclical (and cynical) for Perdue\u2019s campaign to use this material in this way.\n\nNunn, who is on leave from Points of Light during the campaign, began running it in 2007 when another civic organization she headed merged with Points of Light. Before she came on board, an arm of Points of Light known as MissionFish in 2003 struck a deal with eBay Inc. in which sellers on the auction site could direct their proceeds to the charities that had been verified by MissionFish as tax-exempt. Eventually, in 2011, Points of Light sold MissionFish to eBay; in 2013, eBay renamed it PayPal Giving Fund.\n\nWhat\u2019s the alleged terrorism link? One of the thousands of charities verified by MissionFish is Islamic Relief USA. Though the organization is not mentioned in the campaign memo, National Review highlighted the fact that donations of more than $13,000 flowed through MissionFish to Islamic Relief USA, resulting in the contributions being listed in some of Points of Light\u2019s public filings (a 990 form) with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nNational Review noted that in June, the Israeli defense minister signed an order barring Islamic Relief Worldwide, an umbrella group based in the United Kingdom, as illegal, claiming it was \u201canother source of income for Hamas,\u201d the militant group that controls Gaza. The action was part of a crackdown on Hamas in the wake of the abduction of three Israeli students \u2014 which ultimately led to a war this summer between Israel and Hamas.\n\nSecond, Islamic Relief Worldwide adamantly denied Israel\u2019s allegations, saying in a statement on June 19 that it was \u201cextremely surprised and concerned by this, and categorically denies any links with Hamas.\u201d The group noted that \u201cIslamic Relief Worldwide is regulated in the U.K. by the Charity Commission and has rigorous internal control and compliance systems in place to ensure we uphold our humanitarian principles of impartiality, independence and neutrality.\u201d\n\nFinally, Islamic Relief USA says it is a legally independent entity. \u201cOf the many projects IRUSA works on simultaneously, we currently assist in providing aid to the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cIn Gaza, this is done exclusively through our partner UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency], the United Nations agency that is mandated to assist those affected by this conflict. In fact, IRUSA was the only non-governmental organization to be officially recognized by UNRWA in a press release and comments at the United Nations in Geneva.\u201d\n\nThis is a pretty smarmy ad, so one can see why Neil Bush is demanding it be withdrawn. The Perdue campaign tries to give itself cover by saying it was quoting from a Nunn campaign document, when in fact that document simply said this would be an expected campaign attack.", "lang": "en"}
