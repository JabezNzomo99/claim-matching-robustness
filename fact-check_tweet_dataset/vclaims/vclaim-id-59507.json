The proposals seek to build on the current system, where many Americans get coverage through work.\n\nThe plans do, however, implement new consumer protections and introduce new ways of regulating health insurance companies.\n\nThese new rules will surely change the current health care system. The bill in the House of Representatives gives employer-provided insurance five years to come into compliance with new rules, such as caps on out-of-pocket expenses and coverage for preventive care.\n\nRight now, employers have the freedom to change or drop coverage, and they will continue to have that freedom under health reform. Doctors, too, can opt in or out of accepting various insurance plans, including Medicare. Because of this inherent instability to the health care system, and because of the new regulations, we rated one of Obama's earlier statements on the effects of reform \u2014 \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan\" \u2014 Half True .\n\nGiven what we know about reform, it seems likely that at least some people will have employers who decide to change plans when insurers alter their offerings under the new regulations. This would be most likely for any small businesses that currently offer health insurance. They will be allowed to use a national exchange where insurers compete to offer insurance, and prices are expected to be lower.\n\nObama's statement from the speech is more carefully phrased than his earlier statement. In his speech, he said that if you are \"already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have.\" That is true, there is nothing in the plan that proactively forces these kinds of changes, and the bills clearly intend to leave much of the current health care system in place. We rate Obama's statement True.", "lang": "en"}
