The post identifies the body of water as Pangong Lake and the helicopters as belonging to the Indian Air Force. Pangong Lake is currently divided between Indian and Chinese-controlled territory, according to Forbes.\n\n\u201cIAF attack helicopters Apache patrolling over Pangong Tso lake in Ladakh recently,\u201d the caption reads.

U.S. military pilots and veterans posted the video on Instagram with captions identifying the location as Lake Havasu, and the Google Maps street view of the lake shows similar hills in the background to those in the video being shared.\n\nThe Lake Havasu City Convention Center and Visitors Bureau appeared to respond to rumors about the footage in early July, posting India Today\u2019s article debunking the claim that it shows Pangong Lake on Facebook.\n\n\u201cLake Havasu finds its way into the news in the oddest ways sometimes,\u201d the bureau wrote in the Facebook post. \u201cThank you to India Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room for debunking this story.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Lake Havasu City Convention Center and Visitors Bureau also confirmed that the video was filmed on Lake Havasu in an email to AFP Fact Check, adding, \u201cOur airport has a fueling contract with the US military, so we see these types of aircraft from time to time.\u201d\n\nIn the comments section of the bureau\u2019s Facebook post, a user named Daniel Warner claimed that he filmed the footage on June 17, 2018, sharing two additional video clips of the helicopters flying above Lake Havasu.", "lang": "en"}
