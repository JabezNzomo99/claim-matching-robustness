Do your thing Facebook!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe image being shared on Facebook is of another protest leader known as River, according to news reports. According to KIRO 7 News, he was arrested after a brief chase from Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood to Interstate 5. Police said he was suspected of possessing a stolen vehicle.\n\nFor weeks, protesters calling for racial justice occupied several blocks of the Capitol Hill neighborhood after Seattle police abandoned the precinct there. The result was an \"experiment in police-free governance,\" in The New Yorker\u2019s words, that drew criticism from conservatives and President Donald Trump. It was ultimately cleared by police.\n\nSimone was a regular figure at CHOP, leading protesters in marches and speaking to the media. But we found no news reports that he has been arrested.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
