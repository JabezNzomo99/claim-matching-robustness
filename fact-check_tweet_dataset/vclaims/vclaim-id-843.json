Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, recently defended Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s decision to restore voting rights to about 206,000 felons who have served their time and said Republicans opposing the action want to suppress turnout in this fall\u2019s presidential election.\n\nLocke participated in a May 8 of McAuliffe\u2019s decree conducted by NewsOne.com, an outlet to presenting news to black Americans.\n\n\"There\u2019s this feeling that somehow, since the governor did this, that somehow this state is once again going to vote for a Democrat for president of the United States,\" she said. \"So that is the fear, that somehow, these 206,000 individuals are going to vote for a Democrat.\"\n\n\"We do not have voters in this country flocking to the polls,\" she added. \"The United States has a low voter turnout rate. You would think that you would want individuals voting in this country.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of Republicans who are accusing McAuliffe of issuing the blanket restoration of rights to help presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton - his good friend and fellow Democrat - carry Virginia this fall. What caught our attention is Locke\u2019s claim that the U.S. has a low voter turnout. We wondered if she\u2019s right.\n\nLocke pointed us to a May 2015 by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. It examined voter turnout in the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 democratic nations - mostly with industrialized economies - seeking to improve trade.\n\nPew looked at OECD members\u2019 most recent national elections. It computed the votes cast as a percentage of each country\u2019s estimated voting-age population.\n\nIn the U.S., Pew estimated that 53.6 percent of citizens old enough to vote participated in the 2012 presidential election. That ranked 31st among OECD nations. The only trailers were:\n\nBy contrast, the five countries with the highest age-eligible turnout were:\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that three of the top five - Belgium, Turkey and Australia - have mandatory voting laws. There are in the world that enforce such statutes, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.\n\nIf Pew\u2019s 53.6 percent voting-age participation estimate for the U.S. in 2012 sounds low to you, there\u2019s a good reason.\n\nTurnout often is expressed as the percentage of registered voters who cast ballots and, under this measure, the U.S. does fairly well. In 2012, when President Barack Obama won a second-term challenge from Republican Mitt Romney, 84.3 of registered voters went to the polls - ranking seventh in that measurement among OECD countries.\n\nBut Pew says national turnout comparisons based on registered voters \"may not be very meaningful.\" That\u2019s because \"in most countries, the government takes the lead in getting people\u2019s names on the rolls - whether by registering them automatically (as in, for example Sweden or Germany) or by aggressively seeking out and registering eligible voters (as in the U.K. and Australia). As a result, turnout looks pretty similar regardless of whether you\u2019re looking at voting-age population or registered voters.\n\n\"In the U.S., by contrast, registration is mainly an individual responsibility,\" Pew says. \"And registered voters represent a much smaller share of potential voters in the U.S. than just about any other OECD country: Only 65 percent of the U.S. voting age population (and 71 percent of the voting-age citizenry) is registered, according to the Census Bureau, compared with 96 percent in Sweden and 93 percent in the U.K.\"\n\nFor these reasons, Pew said that political scientists \"typically\" measure turnout by looking at the percentage of age-eligible people who went to the polls.\n\nWe found one other data source that compares election turnouts based on countries\u2019 voting-age population. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance compiles that information for 109 nations and territories. The U.S., with its 53.6 percent turnout in 2012, ranked 73rd.\n\nTop on its list is Uzbekistan, a landlocked former member of the Soviet Union, where 98.4 percent of age-eligible people voted in its 2015 presidential election. At the bottom is Haiti, an impoverished Caribbean nation, had an 18.9 percent turnout.\n\nLocke said \"The United States has a low voter turnout rate.\"\n\nShe based her statement on a Pew study that shows the U.S. ranks 31st among 34 OECD nations in the percentage of age-eligible people who cast ballots in recent national elections. Wider data, compiled by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, ranks the U.S. 73rd among 109 nations and territories.", "lang": "en"}
