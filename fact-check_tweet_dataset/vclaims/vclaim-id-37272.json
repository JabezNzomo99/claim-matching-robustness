The aerial photo, on the other hand, is mapping website mapio.net's undated photo of Metro Manila taken from an airplane.\n\nFacebook detected the fake news circulating on its platform the same week news about Boracay's re-opening in October was published. The Duterte administration closed off the tourist destination in April for rehabilitation and clean-up.\n\nSocial media traffic to the story largely came from the pages Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos, SNP - Social News Philippines and President Rodrigo Duterte Supporters Around The World, and could have reached over 1.5 million people.", "lang": "en"}
