Amid this, a photo of a crying man is doing the rounds on social media with the claim that this is the Italian Prime Minister who could not control his tears over the rising death toll due to Covid-19 in his country.\n\nClaiming that the Italian PM has lost all hopes, social media users are sharing an article by a website called \"The Daily Bihar\". This article too has used the same picture and claims that the Italian PM broke down over Covid-19 deaths in his country. The archived version of the article can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral post is misleading. The man seen in the picture is not the Italian PM but Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The picture was taken last year in December when Bolsonaro got emotional while recollecting an incident during an official event.\n\nThe misleading post has been shared by thousands of social media users.\n\nWith the help of Google reverse image search, we found a Brazilian website \"PODER 360\" which used the viral picture in an article in December 2019. As per the translation of this article, Bolsonaro got emotional during a 'Thanksgiving' event at his office. During this, he also broke down while remembering the knife attack he suffered during an election campaign in 2018.\n\nWe also found a YouTube video of the event. The video was uploaded by a verified channel showing Bolsonaro getting emotional and crying. AFWA could not find any credible news report saying Italian PM Giuseppe Conte broke down over Covid-19 deaths in his country.\n\nTherefore, we can say that the man seen crying in the viral picture is Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and not Italian PM Giuseppe Conte. Also, the picture was taken a few months back and has no relation to coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
