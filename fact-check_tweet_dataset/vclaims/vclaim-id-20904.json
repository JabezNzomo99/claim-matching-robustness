Most of them were in families where at least one person is in work (\u2018working families\u2019) and most of them are not in poverty.\n\nHere\u2019s how they break down according to the relative poverty measure (the figures differ a little on different measures). According to the estimates, nearly 29 million adults are both out of poverty and in a working family. 4 million are in a workless family but still out of poverty. Meanwhile, 3.2 million are in a working family but also in poverty. And 2.6 million are both in a workless family and in poverty.\n\nWe made a table to set that out more clearly:\n\nThis shows, for example, that most adults in relative poverty (55%) are actually in a working family, as Jeremy Corbyn said this afternoon. At the same time, adults in working families are much less likely to be in relative poverty than those from workless families.\n\nThat 3.2 million adults in poverty from a working family rises to 4.6 million if you add in housing costs.\n\nAs we\u2019ve looked at before, over time people in poverty are increasingly likely to be in work, although the trend has flattened in recent years.", "lang": "en"}
