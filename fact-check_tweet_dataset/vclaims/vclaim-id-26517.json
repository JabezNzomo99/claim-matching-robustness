The survey it\u2019s based on likely overestimates the amount that has been stockpiled, and consumer spending data shows no evidence of people stockpiling to this degree. We can\u2019t definitively say this amount of stockpiling hasn\u2019t occurred, but there are very strong reasons to be sceptical.\n\nWhere does the \u00a34 billion figure come from?\n\nThe finding comes from a survey conducted by the research company Consumer Intelligence, on behalf of the finance provider Premium Credit.\n\nThe press release says Consumer Intelligence surveyed a representative sample of 1,052 adults in the UK, and found that 20% had stockpiled goods in preparation for Brexit. (It didn\u2019t specify in preparation for a no deal Brexit).\n\nIt calculated that this meant around ten million Britons have stockpiled for Brexit, based on the total adult population of the UK being just over 52 million.\n\nThe survey also found that, among those who had stockpiled, the average amount stockpiled was \u00a3380. They multiplied this figure by the roughly ten million people they estimated to have stockpiled across the country, to come up with the \u00a34 billion figure.\n\nThere is a problem with this calculation.\n\nThe \u00a34 billion figure is likely too high\n\nIn extrapolating the survey findings to work out the total amount stockpiled the general population, Consumer Intelligence used the total number of UK adults rather than the total number of households. In doing this, it\u2019s likely that Consumer Intelligence overestimated the amount Britons are stockpiling.\n\nThat\u2019s because there is a strong likelihood that people responded to the survey on behalf of their household, rather than themselves as an individual.\n\nTo illustrate this, imagine you live with a partner and together you\u2019ve stockpiled \u00a3400 worth of food. If a survey asks you how much you\u2019ve stockpiled, you\u2019d probably say \u00a3400, rather than working out your individual share of \u00a3200.\n\nIt seems likely that at least some\u2014and probably most\u2014 respondents would report a household figure rather than their individual sum.\n\nSo Consumer Intelligence\u2019s data is likely to more accurately represent the amount the average household had stockpiled, rather than the average individual. If it does indeed reflect household stockpiling, it would have been more appropriate to use the total number of households to extrapolate the findings to the national level, rather than the total number of UK adults.\n\nOverall, there are around 28 million households in the UK. We know that Consumer Intelligence\u2019s extrapolation is based off the figure of 52 million adults.\n\nSo if even a minority of respondents reported a household figure rather than an individual figure, the extrapolation could have considerably overestimated the total amount stockpiled in the country.\n\nWe cannot know for certain if this has happened, as we haven\u2019t seen the original survey results. But based on what we\u2019ve seen of the methodology, and the fact that respondents were asked \u2018how much have you spent on stockpiling\u2019, it seems likely that this problem has affected the results.\n\nThe wording of the press release added to the confusion\n\nThe press release reporting Consumer Intelligence\u2019s findings stated that the survey was based on \u201c1,052 consumers in the UK currently in employment\u201d. We pointed out in the original version of this article that this would mean that the findings could not be representative of the UK as a whole, because they did not survey anyone who was unemployed or retired. We also stated that it was reasonable to expect that the stockpiling habits of unemployed and retired people might differ to those of employed people.\n\nSince we first published the article, we\u2019ve been told that there was an error in the original press release, and that the survey did in fact include retired and unemployed people and is representative of the UK as a whole.\n\nIt remains unclear why much of the media coverage of the story referred to the \u00a34 billion figure as the total amount stockpiled by \u201cBritons\u201d or \u201cBrits\u201d when the wording of the original press release suggested that the findings could not be representative of the UK as a whole.\n\nOther evidence suggests \u00a34 billion is too high\n\nIf such a high level of stockpiling were occurring, you\u2019d expect that to show up in consumer spending data.\n\nWe asked the British Retail Consortium, which compiles a monthly measure of UK retail sales, whether it had seen any evidence of people stockpiling in preparation for Brexit.\n\nAndrew Opie, Director of Food & Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing evidence of individual stockpiling in sales and there\u2019s no need for consumers to do so. Retailers have increased stocks of longer life products we typically buy to cope with any disruption. The biggest problem in a no deal Brexit is fresh fruit and vegetables where supplies are likely to be disrupted and it\u2019s impractical for anyone to stockpile.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
