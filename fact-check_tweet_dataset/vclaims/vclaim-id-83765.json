There is no new airport in Manila and the false reports use an image from a design for a planned Chinese airport to mislead.\n\nWebsites such as this and this claim that Manila has a second airport alongside the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).\n\nThe reports, and the accompanying posts when shared on Facebook, show a montage of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and the purported new airport terminal.\n\nBelow is a screengrab of one of the posts.\n\nThe headline in the post, when translated to English, says: \u201cBoom, amazing! NAIA has no match for the newest airport in Manila: WOW watch!\"\n\nThe headline in the misleading articles are the same as in the Facebook posts.\n\nThe image of the terminal used in the false posts is not of a new one in the Philippines. It can be traced back to a Chinese project by the international architecture firm Corgan.\n\nThe firm\u2019s website says the image is part of its design for a proposed airport in the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian.\n\nPhilippine aviation authorities and the state-run media have also not reported that there is any new airport in Manila.\n\nNAIA is the only airfield listed on the website and official Facebook account of the Manila International Airport Authority, which operates the city\u2019s airport.\n\nThe government\u2019s official TV station, People\u2019s Television Network, has no reports of there being a new airport in Manila.\n\nThe post has been widely shared by Facebook groups that support Duterte and his political allies.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of data from social media monitoring platform CrowdTangle, which shows that one of the reports has been shared to more than 800,000 people on Facebook.\n\nAnd below is a snapshot of a replica article from a different URL that has been shared to more than 200,000 people on Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
