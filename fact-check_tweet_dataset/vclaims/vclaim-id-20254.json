It reminded us of the time in mid-2018 when he repeatedly claimed the quarterly trade deficit had declined $52 billion and complained that \u201cnobody reports it.\u201d\n\nRegular readers know that we frequently say that Trump\u2019s obsession with trade deficits is misplaced. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price.\n\nThe trade-deficit numbers are also shaped by underlying factors, such as an imbalance between a country\u2019s savings and investment rates. A bigger federal budget deficit \u2014 caused by, say, a large tax cut or more government spending \u2014 can boost the trade deficit because the country saves less and borrows more from abroad. The booming economy can also be at fault \u2014 the more money people have, the more they can spend on goods from overseas. And a strong currency means those foreign goods are cheaper for a particular country and its goods are more expensive for foreign consumers. (The video above explains this in more detail.)\n\nThe day before the president spoke in Hanoi, the Commerce Department released an advance report of the December trade deficit. It showed the deficit for trade in merchandise \u2014 the figure Trump often refers to \u2014 was $79.5 billion in December, up $9 billion from $70.5 billion in November.\n\nWe presume Trump was not paying attention to trade data while he was involved in high-level diplomacy. So it\u2019s safe to assume he was referring to the November figures. (We did not get an explanation from the White House.)\n\nIndeed, the earlier report shows that the goods deficit decreased $6.7 billion, to $71.6 billion. But, as we have just shown, the deficit went up the next month \u2014 to what turns out to be a record high (before inflation) for the goods deficit. Actually, a better measure would be to compare November 2018 to November 2017. That shows the trade deficit increased year over year.\n\nMoreover, despite that drop in November, the trade deficit for all of 2018 is expected to be one of the highest on record. The Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019s report on the fourth-quarter gross domestic product, released hours after the president spoke to reporters in Hanoi, indicates that the gap between goods and services exports and imports widened to more than $625 billion, compared with $566 billion in 2017. That would be the highest trade-deficit number in 10 years.\n\nThe GDP report also indicates that the goods deficits will widen to more than $900 billion, compared with $810 billion in 2017. This presumably will be a crushing blow to a president who spent the past year falsely claiming the United States \u201clost\u201d $800 billion on trade.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s claim that the deficit came down because of \u201ctariff money,\u201d that\u2019s poppycock. We\u2019d previously estimated that the Trump tariffs brought in about $3 billion in November (and a roughly equivalent amount in December). But that pales in comparison to monthly deficits of $70 billion to $80 billion. Moreover, the tariffs would affect the deficit only by decreasing imports, not by reducing the trade-deficit figure.\n\nBut there\u2019s been no decline in imports. Using three-month moving averages to smooth out the data, we see imports generally kept moving up, until a slight drop from October to November. Comparing individual months in 2018 to 2017, imports were higher every month in 2018.\n\nThe president keeps seizing on scraps of data \u2014 a month here or a quarter there \u2014 to falsely claim the trade deficit is being reduced. But over the course of the year, it kept growing. Attributing a small one-month shift to tariffs is especially silly.\n\nIt would be better for the president to end his focus on the trade deficit, because whether it grows or shrinks is largely beyond his control. But in the meantime, he earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
