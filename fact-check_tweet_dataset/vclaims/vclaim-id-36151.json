But AFP photos show he did attend Yokohama summit\n\nSupporters of a pro-Biafran separatist group in Nigeria said images of President Muhammadu Buhari arriving in Japan for a summit were faked and cast doubt on his attendance. He did attend the event in the city of Yokohama. An AFP photographer in Japan took pictures of the president at the summit on African development.\n\nOne post from August 27, 2019, archived here, said footage and pictures used by reputable Nigerian media outlets of Buhari arriving in Japan for the summit were \u201cfake photoshopped images and digitally altered videos\u201d.\n\nThe account, named after the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, said that the media had been used \u201cin the propagation of deliberate falsehood\u201d that Buhari \u201cis in Japan when clearly he was in Oman\u201d.\n\nAnother post here pushed by those sympathetic to IPOB claimed to show a flight log for the presidential jet showing it was flying to Muscat, Oman before heading to Japan.\n\nMany other posts claiming the same information have been shared on Twitter, Facebook and blogs in Nigeria. We archived some of them here, here, here, here, and here.\n\nBuhari actually was in Japan\n\nDespite the various claims made in the posts, Buhari did indeed attend the summit with leaders from Africa and Japan. AFP pictures taken at the event on August 28 show Buhari smiling in a group photo with the other leaders and dignitaries at the event. A picture from the Imperial Household Agency of Japan also showed him at a meeting with Japan\u2019s crown prince and princess.\n\nNigerian officials dismissed the claims that footage of Buhari\u2019s arrival had been faked. Nigerian media also carried numerous reports and images showing the leader attending the summit and other events in Japan.\n\nAn AFP video also shows Buhari in Yokohama, attending the conference.\n\nIn the past, IPOB had claimed that Buhari had died and was replaced by a lookalike called Jibril from Sudan.
