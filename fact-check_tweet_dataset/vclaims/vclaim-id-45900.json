The move comes amid protests against police brutality and a national outcry to remove Confederate statues and symbols around the country.\n\nNow, a Facebook post is sharing an outrageous claim that the racing association \"forces\" its drivers to participate in Muslim prayer. It features a photo of a row of drivers kneeling down, bent over with their heads touching the floor.\n\nThe caption reads: \"So NASCAR bans the confederate flag but FORCES all their drivers to do Muslim prayer? I wouldn\u2019t have believed it if I didn\u2019t see it with my own eyes. Unacceptable!!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis is bogus. NASCAR does not force its drivers to participate in Muslim prayer, or any other religious activity, and the photo displayed shows drivers taking part in a tradition called the \"kissing the bricks.\"\n\nThe tradition takes place at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's yard-length section of bricks called the \"Yard of Bricks\" and was started in 1996 by Dale Jarrett.\n\nAfter his Brickyard 400 victory, Jarrett and his crew walked out to the start-finish line and kissed the bricks. Since then, winners of various races at the speedway have done the same.\n\nA reverse-image search shows that the photo in the post was taken on July 24, 2016, when Kyle Busch won the Combat Wounded Coalition 400 at the speedway. Busch, his wife, and others took part in the tradition.\n\nA Facebook post that displays a photo of NASCAR drivers kneeling down kissing the floor claims that the racing association forces its athletes to participate in Muslim prayer, yet banned the confederate flag.\n\nThis isn\u2019t true. NASCAR doesn\u2019t force or require drivers to partake in any religious activities. The image shows drivers taking part in a longstanding tradition called the \"kissing the bricks\" at the Indianapolis Speedway.\n\nThis is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
