The claim is false; a US court did award compensation to children who fell ill after vaccinations, but from brain injury and not from autism.\n\nThe article by Alternative News Network dates from May 29, 2017 and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook pages including \u2018Illuminati Exposed (This is the resistance)\u2019, which has more than one million followers.\n\nThe article headlined \u2018Courts quietly confirm MMR vaccine causes autism\u2019 says: \u201ccourts, governments and vaccine manufacturers have quietly conceded the fact that the Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine most likely does cause autism and stomach diseases\u201d. It repeats claims published in a 2013 article by The Liberty Beacon website. A second article citing The Liberty Beacon is also circulating in French.\n\n\u201cPharmaceutical companies have even gone so far as to pay out massive monetary awards, totaling in the millions, to the victims in an attempt to compensate them for damages and to buy their silence,\u201d Alternative News Network says.\n\nThe article bases these claims on two cases dating back to 2012 where children were awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars by the US National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\n\nIn the first case, the parents of Ryan Mojabi, then aged nine, claimed that their son suffered \u201ca severe and debilitating injury to his brain, described as Autism Spectrum Disorder\u201d after receiving several vaccinations between 2003 and 2005, including \u201cmore specifically, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations\u201d (see below).\n\nIn fact, the US court found no link between the MMR vaccination and autism, contrary to what Alternative News Network says.\n\nThe court actually found that Ryan suffered encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) within five to fifteen days of his first MMR vaccination on December 19, 2003. They awarded nearly a million dollars in compensation to Ryan\u2019s family.\n\nBrain damage is a very rare possible side effect of the MMR vaccine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s website.\n\nIn the second case, the Alternative News Network says a girl named Emily -- daughter of Jill Lowrie -- \u201cwon compensation following vaccine-related brain injury that, once again, involved MMR and resulted in autism\u201d.\n\nThis claim was reported in a Huffington Post article in January 2013. Its author David Kirby said the US vaccine court awarded Emily\u2019s family millions of dollars after they alleged she was \"severely injured by a reaction to the DTaP vaccine at 15 months (when MMR, HiB and prevnar were also given)\". He added that Emily \"has seizure disorder and PDD-NOS, a form of ASD (autism spectrum disorder)\".\n\nBut the US Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) \"did not admit that vaccination caused encephalopathy or autism\", he says.\n\nThe alleged link between the MMR vaccination and autism is added into the Alternative News Network\u2019s article, published four years later.\n\nHowever, the ruling in Emily\u2019s court case does not mention the words \u2018MMR\u2019 or \u2018autism\u2019. It actually says her mother, Jillian, claims she suffered brain inflammation after receiving a diphtheria, tetanus and a cellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccination.\n\nThe ruling refers to Jillian Lowrie rather than \u2018Jillian Moller\u2019, as the woman is named in the Huffington Post article, but includes the same dates and first names for the woman and child.\n\nEmily was awarded a lump sum of more than one million dollars, plus several hundreds of thousands of dollars for \"lost future earnings\", \"pain and suffering\" and \"life care expenses\", as the Huffington Post article mentions.\n\nThe US \u2018vaccine court\u2019 \u2013 the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program \u2013 was rolled out in the 1980s when lawsuits against vaccination companies and healthcare providers \"threatened to cause vaccine shortages and reduce U.S. vaccination rates, which could have caused a resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases\", the programme says on its website.\n\nBrain inflammation is recorded in fewer than one in 10 million doses, the French medical agency (ANSM) says. \u201cThe risk of developing brain inflammation after receiving a vaccine is much lower than the risk of developing it because of natural infections,\u201d ANSM added.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that many people with autism do suffer from brain inflammation, as this 2015 study says. But \u201cit would be false to say that the measles vaccination can cause autism because inflammation of the brain can cause autistic spectrum problems,\u201d said professor Kumaran Deiva, head of paediatric neurology at Bic\u00eatre hospital in France.\n\n\u201cYou will not find, except well-established genetic causes, any viral infection which causes autism,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cInflammation of the brain can cause autistic traits, but not \u2018real\u2019 autism, which is characterised by language, behaviour and social interaction difficulties.\u201d\n\nAlternative News Network also bases its claims on a study published in The Lancet medical journal in 1998 by British doctor Andrew Wakefield. The site says that Ryan Mojabi and Emily Moller\u2019s cases \u201cconfirmed Dr. Wakefield\u2019s original concern\u201d about the link between the MMR vaccination and autism.\n\nHowever, Andrew Wakefield was struck off as a doctor in the UK and the study was retracted from The Lancet in 2010 after it was found the study included falsified data.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the study caused \u201cpanic that led to dropping immunization rates\u201d and \u201csubsequent outbreaks\u201d of diseases. \u201cThere is no evidence of a link between MMR vaccine and autism or autistic disorders,\u201d it added.\n\nThe number of measles cases rocketed by 50 percent last year, the WHO said on February 14. Cases of the disease had already spiked 30 percent between 2016 and 2017.\n\n\u201cThe increase in measles cases is deeply concerning, but not surprising,\u201d Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance said. He said, \u201ccomplacency about the disease and the spread of falsehoods about the vaccine in Europe\u201d had contributed to its spread.", "lang": "en"}
