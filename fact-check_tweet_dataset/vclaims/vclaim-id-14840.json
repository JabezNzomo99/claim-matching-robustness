He actually said they would be built across the country. \n\n\n\n, after a week of protests about service delivery in the township.\n\nThe country is set to hold national elections on 8 May 2019.\n\nThe protests were widely covered by the media, as was Ramaphosa\u2019s speech to angry residents.\n\n\u201cWe have built more than 4 million houses and, here in Alexandra, I want you to know we are still going to build houses so our people can get houses,\u201d Ramaphosa\n\nreported that he \u201cpromised to build a million houses for the residents of Alexandra\u201d.\n\nHas the government built more than 4 million houses? And did Ramaphosa promise to build 1 million in Alexandra? We checked.\n\nAccording to the\n\n, 3.3 million houses or \u201chousing units\u201d were built from the 1994/95 financial year to December 2018.\n\nThese include subsidised houses, rental accommodation, hostel upgrades and council houses where ownership was granted, departmental spokesperson Xolani Xundu\n\nAlmost 1.2 million \u201cserviced sites\u201d were delivered in the same period. These are plots of land supplied with water, electricity and sanitation. Nearly 370,000 units were also provided under the Enhanced Extended Discount Benefit Scheme (EEDBS).\n\nThis scheme \u201cprovides state subsidies to repair and/or rehabilitate and even demolish and rebuild, where necessary, government rental houses built before 1994 and then transfer houses into the ownership of legitimate occupants\u201d.\n\nIn total, the government has provided 4.8 million housing opportunities.\n\nBut the statistics have not been independently verified. A housing expert previously\n\nthat they should be \u201cread with caution, as indicative rather than entirely conclusive\u201d.\n\nreported that Ramaphosa promised to build 1 million houses in Alexandra. A recording of his speech shows this is incorrect.\n\nnews, the country\u2019s public broadcaster. At around the\n\n\u201cI am here with our minister of human settlements and, listen carefully, they have a programme for the whole of South Africa to build 1 million houses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOne million houses will be built and, here in Alexandra, we will look into the issue of land so that when we build houses we build them in the correct manner.\u201d\n\nabout the misreporting, saying it was a \u201chuge distortion\u201d.\n\nHis tweet reads: \u201cThe ANC government intends to build 1 million over the next 5 years throughout the country. Every province will be given a target that they must meet. This is something that I would like to see and it is possible.\u201d\n\nIs there a programme to build 1 million houses?\n\nAfrica Check asked the department of human settlements if they had a plan to build 1 million houses over the next five years.\n\nBut the department\u2019s spokesperson would not say if there was an official programme.\n\n\u201cIf the president says we are going to build a million houses, we are going to build a million houses,\u201d said Xundu.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like an instruction to the department.\u201d\n\nDirector of research and advocacy at the\n\n, Alana Potter, told Africa Check that the goal was ambitious.\n\n\u201cLooking back on our track record over the last 25 years\u2026 to do a million seems like quite a big ask,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt would require a really rapid land release programme so they\u2019d really need to move fast to get that happening.\u201d\n\nThe construction of houses peaked in 1998/98 when 235,635 units were built. Delivery has\n\nsince then, with just 86,006 units built in 2017/18.\n\nNo government administration has managed to build 1 million houses during their five-year term. The highest number of houses was built from 1999/2000 to 2003/04.\n\nWe have determined what Ramaphosa said to the residents of Alexandra. But it\u2019s not possible to fact-check if 1 million houses will be built - we\u2019re not fortune tellers.\n\nAfrica Check will log this commitment on our\n\n.
