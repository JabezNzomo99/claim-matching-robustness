His previous articles on this issue have used UCAS data so that\u2019s what we have looked at.\n\nThere are some flaws with UCAS\u2019 data on Scottish education. This means that comparisons with England should be done cautiously. However, we can roughly say that 18 year olds living in the least advantaged areas in England are about twice as likely to go to university as 18 year olds in the least advantaged areas in Scotland, based on UCAS figures.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that this is the case for higher education more generally, because this excludes a significant number of students in Scotland who study higher education in colleges.\n\nEducational disadvantage isn\u2019t always the same thing as being \u2018poor\u2019, even if you might expect to find them side by side\n\nUCAS uses a measure called POLAR3 to measure disadvantage, which ranks small areas in the UK according to how many people living in that area are in higher education by the age of 19. There are five different groups. Each group contains about 20% of young people in the UK.\n\nAccording to this measure, nearly twice as many 18 year olds in the least advantaged areas in England got a place at university\u201419.5% compared to only 10.7% of their Scottish counterparts in 2016.\n\nUsing POLAR3 isn\u2019t ideal to check claims about poverty. The Higher Education Funding Council for England, which produces the measure, notes that POLAR3 is only a measure of educational disadvantage relating to participation in higher education, and \u201cis not necessarily an appropriate substitute for other measures of disadvantage\u201d.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another problem with this comparison.\n\nPOLAR3 categories don\u2019t compare the same numbers of people in England and Scotland\n\nThis is a flawed comparison according to UCAS.\n\nFar fewer young people live in the areas defined as least advantaged by POLAR3 in Scotland as do in England (relative to the total number of young people in each nation). This tends to push down the entry rate for these areas in Scotland, making it hard to single out the effect of being disadvantaged.\n\nTo be more confident in our comparison, and to focus more on poverty, UCAS suggested another option is to look at the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). Like POLAR3, this ranks local areas into five different groups. But unlike POLAR3 there aren\u2019t fewer Scottish young people in the areas defined as \u201cleast advantaged\u201d.\n\nThe SIMD also looks at more things than just education, such as income and health.\n\nThis measure paints a similar picture. 10.9% of Scottish 18 year olds in the least advantaged areas by the SIMD measure got offered a higher education place in 2016.\n\nSo that's roughly the same proportion as the POLAR3 measure for Scotland. And UCAS said it was likely that the equivalent measure for England would be at least twice that (but that more research would be needed to map them over exactly).\n\nSo UCAS said on this basis, it\u2019s reasonable to say that the least advantaged 20% of 18 year olds in Scotland seem roughly half as likely to get into university, even if we're not directly comparing like-with-like.\n\nThere is another aspect of higher education in Scotland that UCAS figures don\u2019t cover\n\nWe\u2019ve been talking about \u201chigher education\u201d entry rates but these figures actually exclude a substantial part of the Scottish higher education system.\n\nAbout one third of young full time undergraduate study is provided by further education colleges in Scotland.\n\nMany of these Scottish colleges do not use the centralised UCAS system and so don\u2019t provide information for UCAS to include in their entry rates. So in Scotland there is \u201ca substantial section of provision that is not included in UCAS' figures\u201d.\n\nThis means that we can use the UCAS figures to roughly compare entry to university between Scotland and England (since UCAS told us most of the provision in England is in universities), but they don\u2019t provide the full story about educational disparity in Scotland.\n\nYoung people may not be going to university as much in Scotland but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they aren\u2019t studying to a higher level of education. Scotland actually has a relatively high overall participation rate in higher education in UK terms.\n\nThese colleges make a difference to comparisons of access because students from the most deprived areas are over-represented in colleges in Scotland, and underrepresented in Scottish universities, according to the Scottish Funding Council's 2014/15 data.", "lang": "en"}
