The claim itself relies on lifelike images of murder scenes depicted in various Nigerian movies that belong to a portfolio of work by a local special-effects artist.\n\nGRAPHIC CONTENT DISCLAIMER: All the images in this post are movie stills and do not show real-life violence.\n\nThe pictures were used in this Facebook post by an account called \u201cBiafra Broadcasting cooperation - BBC\u201d on January 11, 2020. The post contains six images and has been shared 226 times.\n\nPart of the post reads: \u201cFulani herdsmen attack in plateau state yesterday leaving many dead\u201d.\n\nThree of the pictures depict the same man, but from different angles, with a machete apparently embedded in his skull and what appears to be a great deal of blood flowing from a wound. In the other images, a young boy is shown with objects seeming to protrude from his belly, while two men in the other pictures supposedly have suffered fatal head wounds.\n\nBut the claim of a murderous attack by Nigerian herdsmen is false and none of the pictures shows real instances of violence. Rather, they come from various movies in which Nigerian makeup artist James Akaie has used special effects to create lifelike murder scenes.\n\nFour of the six images bear the watermarks \"jamesakaieffect\" and \u201ctricksplanet\u201d.\n\nSeveral searches on Google with the two phrases led to Akaie's Instagram account where he had posted the same images -- and others -- more than four weeks before the false posts went up.\n\nAkaie describes himself as a \u201cmovie Maker, Special Effect Makeup Artiste and a Prosthetics builder, Special props maker and CEO Tricksplanet\u201d. All the pictures on his Instagram account carry the same two watermarks.\n\nAkaie told AFP that some of the gory scenes depicted in the pictures were created for a movie called The True Caller, which is yet to be released, and another \u201cproduced by BGT Films\u201d, a Nigerian movie production company.\n\nThe True Caller producer Eze Nnamdi Egege, in a telephone interview with AFP, confirmed Akaie\u2019s involvement as a special-effects specialist for the movie.\n\nEgege said: \u201cIt was James who made those things in the pictures,\u201d adding that the violent scenes were \u201cthe concept\u201d of the movie.\n\nA search on YouTube for The True Caller includes a link to this trailer for the unreleased movie. A warning to sensitive viewers; the trailer includes graphic scenes.\n\nA screenshot below left, taken 83 seconds into the trailer, shows a bearded man with a check shirt, almost identical to a picture Akaie posted on his Instagram account in May 2019, below right, describing a \u201cchopped head effect\u201d.\n\nThree of the pictures used to spread the false claim can be found on Akaie\u2019s Instagram page here, here and here. Two of the other three posted here and here have Akaie\u2019s two watermarks, while the last picture found here demonstrates how the special effect is created.\n\nThe false claims hark on repeated cases of violence between mainly Muslim Fulani cattlemen and largely Christian farmers in central Nigeria and the southern part of the west African nation.
