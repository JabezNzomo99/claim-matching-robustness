{"title": "Analysis | President Trump made 2,140 false or misleading claims in his first year", "subtitle": "In that period, the president averaged nearly 5.9 false or misleading claims a day.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-01-20T08:00:29Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85725", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/01/20/president-trump-made-2140-false-or-misleading-claims-in-his-first-year/", "vclaim": "While the president is known to make outrageous claims on Twitter \u2014 and that was certainly a major source of his falsehoods \u2014 he made most of his false statements in unscripted remarks before reporters. Prepared speeches and interviews were other key sources of false claims. That\u2019s because the president relies on talking points or assertions that he had made in the past \u2014 and continued to make, even though they had been fact-checked as wrong.\n\nBut there were also 12 days in which Trump made more than 30 claims. These were often days when he held campaign-style rallies, riffing without much of a script. On July 25, when he held a rally in Youngstown, Ohio, we recorded 52 claims. On Nov. 29, when he spoke in St. Louis, we counted 49 claims. On Dec. 8, he touted Senate hopeful Roy Moore at a rally in Pensacola, Fla., and that yielded another 44 claims.\n\nFrom his earliest days as president, Trump repeatedly took credit for events or business decisions that happened before he took the oath of office \u2014 or had even been elected. Sixty-two times, he has touted that he secured business investments and job announcements that had been previously announced and could easily be found with a Google search.\n\nAmong other deals, Trump took credit for a $1 billion investment by Fiat Chrysler (which the company said was due to talks with unions in 2015), a $1 billion General Motors investment (also in the works for some time), 10,000 jobs added by Walmart (announced in 2016), 10,000 jobs created by Intel (announced originally in 2011), 1 million planned jobs by Chinese e-company Alibaba (a plan outlined in 2015) and a $25 billion investment by Charter Communications (in the works since 2015). Trump also touted a big investment by Japanese company SoftBank \u2014 which announced its investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly asserted (61 times) that the Affordable Care Act was failing or on the edge of disaster or in serious trouble. But the Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges, despite well-documented issues, is not imploding and is expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Indeed, robust enrollment for 2018 has surprised health-care experts.\n\nTrump 57 times repeated the falsehood about having the biggest tax cut in U.S. history, even though Treasury Department data shows it would rank eighth. And 59 times Trump has claimed that the United States pays the highest corporate taxes (26 times) or that it is one of the highest-taxed nations (33 times). The latter is false; the former is misleading, as the effective U.S. corporate tax rate (what companies end up paying after deductions and benefits) ends up being lower than the statutory tax rate.\n\nTrump also made many misleading claims about the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, claiming 44 times a variation of the statement that it was a hoax perpetuated by Democrats. The CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency had announced that they had \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign to influence the election, with a clear preference for Trump. Robert S. Mueller III, the special prosecutor, was appointed by Trump\u2019s Justice Department, and the congressional committees investigating the matter are headed by Republicans.\n\nConsidering that he has been president for a year, we continue to be surprised to see that the president still does not speak correctly about trade deficits and trade policy. On 35 occasions, Trump managed to inflate the U.S. trade deficits with Mexico, South Korea and Canada, or falsely claim the United States had no trade surpluses with any nation \u2014 even though the United States has one with its neighbor to the north.\n\nWe also track the president\u2019s flip-flops on our list, as they are so glaring. He spent the 2016 campaign telling supporters that the unemployment rate was really 42 percent and the official statistics were phony; now, on 50 occasions he has hailed the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years. It was already very low when he was elected \u2014 4.6 percent, the lowest in a decade \u2014 so his failure to acknowledge that is misleading. Eleven other times, Trump claimed credit for good African American unemployment numbers, which had plummeted during President Barack Obama\u2019s term.\n\nAn astonishing 95 times, Trump has celebrated a rise in the stock market \u2014 even though in the campaign he repeatedly said it was a \u201cbubble\u201d that was ready to crash as soon as the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. Well, the Fed has raised rates four times since the election \u2014 and yet the stock market has not plunged as Trump predicted. It has continued a rise in stock prices that began under Obama in 2009. Again, Trump has never explained his shift in position on the stock market, making his consistent cheerleading misleading.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. stock market rise in 2017 was not unique and mirrored a global rise in equities. When looking at the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which is less influenced by individual stocks than the Dow Jones industrial average, it\u2019s clear U.S. stocks haven\u2019t rallied as robustly as some foreign equivalents. The percentage gain in the S&P 500 during Obama\u2019s first year tops Trump\u2019s numbers \u2014 though any president bragging about stock market performance soon finds out it\u2019s a fool\u2019s game. (The percentage gain under Trump ranks fifth in the first years of presidential terms.)", "lang": "en"}
