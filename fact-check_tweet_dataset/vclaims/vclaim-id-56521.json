The claim is misleading; multiple government health officials and the patient himself told AFP that he sought shelter at his sister\u2019s residence, as agreed with health officials, because he was locked out of his own home.\n\nNeth News, a Sri Lankan news website, published the claim here on its Facebook page on April 11, 2020. The post has been shared more than 670 times.\n\nThe Sinhala-language article\u2019s headline translates to English as: \u201cThe first patient from Puttlam who suffered from corona but recovered and returned home found wandering all over the village, violating health instructions\u201d.\n\nThe article reports that the man in Puttlam, a town in northwestern Sri Lanka, \u201cfailed to heed health instructions,\u201d which mandated that he remain in home isolation after he was discharged from hospital. The man\u2019s wife and children, the article adds, were also isolated at the same hospital.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nA similar claim about the man wandering his village in violation of the quarantine order was also shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here.\n\nBut the claim is misleading.\n\nThe Public Health Inspector in Puttlam assigned to monitor the recovered patient refuted the claims, saying that officials had confirmed the man sought shelter at his sister's house after being locked out of his home.\n\nThe man \u201creached home at about 7pm to find it was locked and his family was actually at the quarantine center. So he had sought shelter at his sister\u2019s home located close by,\u201d the inspector told AFP by phone on April 13, 2020.\n\nThe inspector added that authorities then ordered him to remain in quarantine at his sister\u2019s residence for 14 days.\n\n\u201cHe had not wandered the entire village and neither will he do so, as we took measures to station a police officer outside of his sister\u2019s home to keep tabs on him. We have checked on him daily since then and he has followed our instructions well,\u201d the inspector said.\n\nDr. Mohamed Ali Yaseer Arafath, an epidemiologist at the neighbouring Nuwaraeliya Regional Directorate of Health Services, said the Puttlam health services told him that the patient was in contact with them and did not violate quarantine orders.\n\n\u201cHe had informed the officials that he is locked out and that he has no option but to seek shelter at his sister\u2019s. To this, the officials had agreed and had even dropped him at the sister\u2019s house in the ambulance,\u201d Dr. Arafath told AFP during a telephone conversation on April 13, 2020.\n\nDr. Arafath also published this Facebook post on April 13, 2020, rebuking the claims in the misleading posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of his Facebook post:\n\nAFP spoke to the COVID-19 survivor, who said he had adhered to quarantine regulations enforced by local authorities.\n\n\u201cI never wandered the village. I was dropped here by the ambulance I came in and I intend to follow instructions set by the relevant officials,\u201d the man, whose identity is protected under Sri Lankan law on COVID-19 patients, told AFP by phone on April 13, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
