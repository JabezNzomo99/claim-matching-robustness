Biden made no such claim.\n\n Biden was in fact referring to educational debt associated with his children, a fact that could be gleaned by listening to his comments in their entirety.\n\nThe former U.S. vice president\u2019s original remark came during a campaign stop on Aug. 24, 2019, at Keene State College in New Hampshire. He was approached by a woman who spoke about the cost of her education and asked him to promise that, if elected, he wouldn\u2019t forget about college students.\n\nBiden responded by stating he would not forget and said that he is affected by the issue himself, having accumulated $280,000 in debt by putting three of his children through college and graduate school.\n\nCrowder, a Twitter and YouTube personality, later deleted the above tweet and noted the mistake, but not before the misinformation spread on the platform.", "lang": "en"}
