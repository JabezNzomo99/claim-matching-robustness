Andrew Cuomo reject a recommendation for his state to buy 16,000 ventilators in 2015 in preparation for a pandemic? No, that's not true: That is disinformation being spread among conservatives, misinterpreting the facts of a 2015 report by a New York task force about the need for ventilators during a pandemic.\n\nThe reports of Cuomo \"rejecting a recommendation to buy 16,000 ventilators\" came from an article published by The Gateway Pundit on March 22, 2020, titled \"NY Gov. Cuomo Rejected Buying Recommended 16,000 Ventilators in 2015 for Pandemic, Established Death Panels and Lottery Instead\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLife comes at you fast, as the saying goes, or as the case may be in this era of a viral pandemic, death comes at you fast. Sadly it is the latter for the citizens of New York who will pay the price for Gov. Andrew Cuomo's (D) 2015 decision to not fix a shortfall and buy the recommended 16,000 ventilators to shore up the state's stockpile in case of a pandemic. Cuomo spent more money than the cost of the ventilators on a solar panel boondoggle, reports former New York Lieutenant Governor Betsy McCaughey (R) in a syndicated column published this past week . McCaughey reports the Cuomo administration decided instead to establish \"triage officers\" to decide in a crisis who would get a ventilator and who would be left to die.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe report referred to is called Ventilator Allocation Guidelines, and it outlined in stark details who would -- and who would not -- get ventilators if a pandemic hit the state and healthcare facilities began to run out of the life-saving equipment. The report did not make recommendations for the state to purchase 16,000 more ventilators; however, it did make clear that, in a severe pandemic, the state would have a shortfall of nearly 16,000 ventilators. The report was an update to 2007 guidelines.\n\nThere was no recommendation or even a proposal to buy enough ventilators to fill the shortfall, according to the report, which explained:\n\nThe Gateway Pundit article gained traction after U.S. President Donald Trump cited the story in an interview on Fox News with Bill Hemmer, holding up a printed copy and offering to give it to the news anchor. The Gateway Pundit was citing a column by Betsy McCaughey, the New York lietenant governor under Republican Gov. George Pataki from 1995-1998.\n\nThe reports come as Democrat Cuomo's popularity has been rising from his daily news conferences, and as he has become increasingly critical of what he deems a slow federal response to the state's needs brought on by the coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic. In an impassioned plea on March 24, 2020, the governor implored the Trump administration to do more to help his state, which has become the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States.\n\nThe governor said he needs 30,000 ventilators as soon as possible, as New York might see a peak demand of 140,000 urgent care patients in a matter of weeks.\n\nFor his part, Trump tweeted the next day - early on March 25, 2020 - that he is doing all he can, and that 4,000 ventilators are on its way to New York.\n\nIf anything, the 2015 report underestimated the severity of a pandemic, with Cuomo and state health officials now saying the state needs 30,000 ventilators -- nearly double what the report anticipated.\n\nWhile the report did not recommend buying more ventilators, it did outline how ventilators would need to be allocated when sick patients overwhelmed hospitals. The report talks about a color-coded system to help prioritize who gets a ventilator and who doesn't. It also details \"tie-breaker\" possibilities and a lottery system. In fact, the word \"lottery\" appears 29 times in the report.\n\nThe report describes a color-coded system of blue, red, yellow or green to determine one's level of access to a ventilator. Blue represents those who have an underlying medical condition on the \"exclusion criteria list or those who have a high risk of mortality;\" the \"blue\" patients \"do not receive ventilator therapy when resources are scarce,\" the report said.\n\nRed patients are those who get the highest priority \"because they are most likely to recover with treatment,\" according to the report. It adds, \"Patients in the yellow category (intermediate access) are those who are very sick, and their likelihood of survival is intermediate and/or uncertain. ... Patients in the green color code (defer/discharge) are those who do not need ventilator therapy.\"\n\nAll of this, the report said, will weigh heavily on stressed-out healthcare workers.\n\nThe report was made by the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, the state's bioethics commission formed in 1985. It consists of about \"23 Governor-appointed experts who volunteer their time to assist the State in developing public policy on issues arising at the interface of medicine, law, and ethics,\" according to the health commissioner's press release at the time.\n\nOn March 25, 2020, Cuomo was asked about the ventilator issue, and he told reporters that the 2015 report was based off the Spanish Flu:\n\nSee the video here:\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes thegatewaypundit.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
