January 16, 2019\n\nThe price of West Australian rock lobster is set to fall according to WA Premier Mark McGowan thanks to his government\u2019s plan to increase the commercial catch and quarantine a percentage for the domestic market [1].\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the veracity of Mr McGowan\u2019s statement that virtually all WA rock lobster is exported to China, which has led to local lobster prices of around $100/kg. His assertion that prices would fall once a percentage of an increased commercial rock lobster catch was quarantined for the WA market has also been tested.\n\nGovernment and industry data support Mr McGowan\u2019s statement that nearly all commercially-caught WA rock lobster is exported to China.\n\nA WA Government fisheries fact sheet dated December 2018 states \u201ccurrently more than 95 per cent of commercially caught WA rock lobster is exported to China\u201d [2].\n\nIn 2017, a Western Rock Lobster Council report found \u201cstrong demand for live exported western rock lobster to China has seen the price rise steadily, taking market share away from traditional markets of Japan, Taiwan and the USA. Today it is estimated that China is the destination for more than 90 per cent of the live export market\u201d [3].\n\nMeanwhile, seafood retailers in WA were advertising online sales of rock lobster for more than the $100/kg highlighted by Mr McGowan.\n\nA live WA rock lobster weighing between 971g-1221g can be purchased from WA\u2019s Geraldton Fishermen\u2019s Co-operative Ltd for $113 [4]. Manetta Seafood Market sells WA rock lobster online with \u201cpricing calculated on a minimum weight of 500g at $120.00/kg\u201d [5].\n\nThe claim that quarantining a percentage of an increased commercial catch for the domestic market would make more WA rock lobster available to local consumers is also backed up by industry and government figures.\n\nThe WA Government\u2019s fisheries fact sheet [2] outlined plans to increase the lobster catch to the sustainable maximum of 8,000 tonne per annum within 5 years, representing an overall increase of 1,700 tonnes. \u201cOf the 1,700 tonne increase, 315 tonnes will be issued to current licence holders in 2019 with the remaining 1,385 tonnes made available to the Western Australian Government,\u201d it said.\n\nFishing Families WA, a coalition of fishers, processors and unit holders, concurred, saying under the McGowan government plan, 27 per cent more lobsters (1,700 tonne) would be fished with the state government taking 17.3 per cent (1,385 tonne) [6].\n\nMr McGowan\u2019s prediction that the above measures would make WA rock lobster more affordable for consumers cannot be verified. Mr McGowan told Radio 6PR \u201cIf you increase supply it puts downward pressure on prices. Market economics means that if you increase supply, competition and availability will mean prices will go down.\u201d [1] What remains unknown is what demand there will be from WA consumers for the increased supply of lobster and what impact that will have on current price.", "lang": "en"}
