These are called type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively. \n\n\n\n of death in lower and middle income countries. WHO notes that over the past decade, the prevalence of diabetes has risen faster in low and middle-income countries than in high-income ones. that in 2014, about 25 million people in sub-Saharan Africa were living with the disease, up from 4 million in 1980. \n\n\n\n If not well controlled, diabetes may cause blindness, kidney failure and lead to limb amputation, in addition to other long-term consequences.\n\nIn support of his claims, Ikeme directed Africa Check to two studies on diabetes in Nigeria. One,\n\n, cited WHO estimates that 1.7 million Nigerians were living with diabetes while the other\n\n\u201cI fear the [media] reports may be slightly overrepresented as the publications indicate that about 4 million are suggested to have diabetes and 70%-80% of these remain undiagnosed. The prevalence of known diabetes is suggested at 1.7 million Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIkeme specifically spoke of new cases of diabetes in Nigeria (incidence) at the media briefing. But the World Health Organisation\u2019s\n\non diabetes does not include specific data on new cases in Nigeria or sub-Saharan Africa,\n\nThere isn\u2019t any such diabetes data from the global health agency or any other source, Dr Gojka Roglic, who is with the WHO\u2019s department for non-communicable diseases, told Africa Check.\n\nthat in 2015, only 17% of countries in sub-Saharan Africa had a diabetes registry.\n\n\u201cHowever, no data is available on incidence for any country in Africa, so the claim is unsubstantiated,\u201d Roglic added.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s most recent data on Nigeria estimates\n\n\u201cGiven that there are about 90 million adults in Nigeria by United Nations 2015 estimates, the number of adults with diabetes comes to around 3.9 million,\u201d he said. The prevalence in Nigerian children isn\u2019t known, but it wouldn\u2019t \"substantially change the total\", Gojka added.\n\n, an estimated two thirds of people with diabetes in Africa are undiagnosed. In Nigeria the last nationwide survey on the burden of diabetes\n\n\"Because we have poor routine health data collation in Nigeria those [IDF and WHO] estimates are not really reflective of what is happening in the country,\u201d\n\n, who is with the department of demography and social statistics at the\n\ndone on diabetes in Nigeria between 1985 and 2016 in which\n\nAdeloye is a co-author. The research, published in October 2017, found that about 4.7 million Nigerians aged between 20 and 79 years had type 2 diabetes.\n\nIt would thus be correct to say more than five million Nigerians have the two common types of diabetes, said Adeloye.\n\n\u201cEven from the IDF and WHO estimate, 80% of that estimate goes for type 2 diabetes. That means there could be an interval of 20% for other types of diabetes,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo if 4.7 million is 80%, and if we want to model, we could say more than 5 million Nigerians are living with diabetes.\"", "lang": "en"}
