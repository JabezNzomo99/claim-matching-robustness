Later that day, President Trump spoke at the annual Future Farmers of America (FFA) convention in Indianapolis, Indiana, and began his speech by talking about the mass shooting in Pittsburgh, calling it a \u201cwicked act of mass murder\u201d and \u201cpure evil\u201d:\n\nHowever, President Trump was criticized for joking in his later remarks that he had considered cancelling his appearance because he was having a \u201cbad hair day.\u201d Many of those who condemned this joke did not also note that Trump had commenced his FFA speech by addressing and condemning the synagogue shooting.\n\nIn the days following the shooting and President Trump\u2019s response to it, reports emerged that singer/songwriter and music producer Pharrell Williams had been unhappy with another aspect of Trump\u2019s appearance at the FFA convention: his alleged use of Williams\u2019 song \u201cHappy,\u201d of which the Hollywood Reporter wrote:\n\nFor their part, Slate declared in their headline that \u201cTrump Played \u2018Happy\u2019 at a Rally Hours After the Pittsburgh Shooting, and Pharrell Is Not OK with It,\u201d and stated that the song was played at a rally in Illinois, not Indiana:\n\nWilliams\u2019 letter also formed the basis of segments on the late night shows of Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert, both of whom claimed that Trump had been responsible for the use of the song \u201cHappy\u201d before his speech at the FFA convention in Indianapolis:\n\nNone of these reports included any actual evidence that the song \u201cHappy\u201d had been played before Trump\u2019s Indianapolis speech.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Howard King, a high-profile entertainment lawyer who has represented hugely successful musical artists and acts including Metallica and Dr Dre, did indeed send President Trump a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter on behalf of his client Pharrell Williams, accusing Trump of having played the song \u201cHappy\u201d at \u201ca political event in Indiana.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s law firm sent us a copy of the letter, which read as follows:\n\nWe write to you on behalf of our client, Pharrell Williams, composer and performer of the hit song \u201cHappy.\u201d On the day of the mass murder of 11 human beings at the hands of a deranged \u201cnationalist,\u201d you played his song \u201cHappy\u201d to a crowd at a political event in Indiana. There was nothing \u201chappy\u201d about the tragedy inflicted upon our country on Saturday and no permission was granted for your use of this song for this purpose. Pharrell Williams is the owner of the copyright in \u201cHappy,\u201d with the exclusive right to exploit same. Pharrell has not, and will not, grant you permission to publicly perform or otherwise broadcast or disseminate any of his music. The use of \u201cHappy\u201d without permission constitutes copyright infringement in violation of 17 U.S.C. Sec. 501. This also violates Pharrell\u2019s trademark rights under the Lanham Act. Demand is hereby made that you cease and desist from any further unauthorized use of Pharrell Williams\u2019 music.\n\nThe letter is undoubtedly authentic, and Williams\u2019 demand that Trump never use any of his music, on pain of legal action, is real. However, a few significant factual problems exist with the allegations contained in the letter,as well as some of the subsequent news media coverage of it.\n\nFirst, neither the White House nor President Trump himself was responsible for the playing of the song \u201cHappy\u201d at the FFA convention on 27 October 2018. That decision was made by the organizers of the event (and generally the operators of a venue are the ones responsible for rights clearance and royalty payments associated with the use of music played during events held there).\n\nWe tracked down video footage which shows that a live, instrumental version of the song \u201cHappy\u201d (not Pharrell Williams\u2019 own recording of it) was played in the auditorium at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse, around 25 minutes before President Trump\u2019s speech began. The event was streamed live on Facebook by Mercedes Heiner, and the use of \u201cHappy\u201d can be heard in the first four minutes of that video stream:\n\nIn response to our inquiries, a spokesperson for the National FFA Organization, the organizers of the convention, clarified that the song \u201cHappy\u201d was part of a roster of songs which a live organist performed throughout the weekend at the convention and that it had not been chosen by the White House:\n\nThe allegation contained in Williams\u2019 letter, and the subsequent news coverage highlighted above, was that either the White House or Trump himself had \u201cplayed\u201d the song or had at least been responsible for its use. This is false: That decision was made by the organizers of the FFA convention.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s not accurate to describe Trump\u2019s FFA speech as being part of a \u201crally\u201d or \u201cpolitical event.\u201d He was speaking in his capacity as President of the United States at the annual national FFA convention. The event was organized by the National FFA Organization and President Trump was an invited guest there; it was not a political or partisan rally. The FFA spokesperson also emphasized that point in their response to our questions.\n\nFurthermore, some confusion was evident in the reporting about where the song \u201cHappy\u201d was played. Slate wrote that Trump had been responsible for playing the song at a \u201ccampaign rally in Illinois,\u201d but this does not appear to be true.\n\nTrump did speak at a political rally in Murphysboro, Illinois, later on 27 October, but we could find no evidence that the song \u201cHappy\u201d was played there despite our checking almost two hours of footage covering the period from the build-up to his speech.\n\nA viral tweet posted by anti-gun violence activist Shannon Watts falsely claimed that President Trump had walked on stage to the song \u201cHappy.\u201d This is also false: Trump walked on stage to the song \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.\u201d by Lee Greenwood, as shown in another live Facebook video recorded by a convention attendee:\n\nFinally, The Week magazine reported that Trump had \u201cdefended\u201d playing the song \u201cHappy\u201d at the Indianapolis event, declaring \u201crallies are meant to be fun\u201d:\n\nThis was a particularly misleading passage, because although the President did make the comments attributed to him in his interview with Ingraham, absolutely no reference to the song \u201cHappy\u201d had occurred during the interview up to that point. Rather, President Trump was offering an explanation for why he decided to go ahead with his engagements in Indianapolis and Illinois in the wake of the synagogue shooting:", "lang": "en"}
