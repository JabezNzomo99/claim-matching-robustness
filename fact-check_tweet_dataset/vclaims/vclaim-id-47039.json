While both sides have blamed the other for provocation, speculations on the number of Chinese casualties are on a rise. Journalists and media organisations had first claimed that five soldiers of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) were killed and 11 were injured. The figure turned out to be unverified. It was subsequently claimed that 43 Chinese troops lost their lives. This too was misleading information.\n\nAnother figure was shared by Times Now as \u2018breaking news\u2019 on June 17 \u2014 \u201cChina accepts 30 soldiers have been killed during the Ladakh standoff\u201d \u2014 citing China-based Global Times as the source. The tweets were later taken down.\n\nTimes Now also aired a broadcast on the claim where anchors Rahul Shivshankar and Navika Kumar read out 30 names of Chinese soldiers who allegedly died. This can be watched from 4:30 minutes. However, in the end, Kumar said \u201cEven this list put out by Global Times could be a fake forward.\u201d\n\nThe claim that 30 Chinese troops were killed was also tweeted by Prashant Patel Umrao who has often been found promoting misinformation on social media.\n\nA widely circulating claim across Facebook and Twitter suggested, \u201cA spokesperson for the Western Theatre Command that oversees defences of #China\u2019s border with India has released the names of 30 Chinese troops killed by Indian action.\u201d These were the same names read out by Times Now anchors.\n\nAmong those who tweeted the message was retired major general GD Bakshi, a frequent panellist on Times Now.\n\nThe message, which also sites Global Times as the source, shares a link to the website chinanews.com. Times Now\u2019s broadcast was aired at around 6:40 PM while the channel tweeted the claim at 6:49 PM. Alt News received a query for the message at 5:43 PM on WhatsApp.\n\nThe message was circulating on Twitter as well before Times Now\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe link to chinanews.com leads to the website\u2019s homepage and not a report. In the past as well, Alt News has debunked elaborate forwarded messages that carry a link to the homepage of news websites to give the message an illusion of credibility.\n\nA search on the Twitter page and website of Global Times reveals that the organisation has not published any number on Chinese casualties. The last two tweets (1, 2) about the military dispute on Global Times talk about the telephonic conversation between Indian foreign minister and his Chinese counterpart. In fact, the names of the \u201c30 dead Chinese soldiers\u201d were also not found on the website.\n\nAs of this writing, Beijing has not released the number of casualties, dead or injured. This was tweeted by the editor-in-chief of Global Times Hu Xijin on June 16.\n\nThe only numbers floating right now are \u201c43 casualties\u201d reported by ANI based on \u201csources\u201d and \u201c35 casualties\u201d quoted by \u201cUS intelligence sources\u201d according to a website called usnews.com. However, neither has any prominent defence reporter confirmed these figures nor have the governments of both countries released an official number on Chinese casualties.\n\n[Update: Former Indian army officer GD Bakshi\u2019s tweet was added to the report on June 18, 2020.]", "lang": "en"}
