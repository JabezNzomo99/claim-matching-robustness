The claim is false; the Chinese consulate in Melbourne said it had received no reports about a Chinese citizen being arrested over the Australian bushfires; the video was captured by Australian television channel 7NEWS and does not mention the suspect\u2019s nationality.\n\nThe video was shared in this Facebook post on January 15, 2020. It has been viewed more than 200,000 times.\n\nThe 11-second video shows a handcuffed man being taken into a vehicle by police. The 7NEWS logo can be seen on the video, with the text \u201cEXCLUSIVE\u201d.\n\nThe voiceover on the video says: \u201cIn the middle of the bushfire emergency, a 36-year-old appeared at Bairnsdale Court, accused of deliberately lighting a fire at Johnsonville overnight. He\u2019s been denied bail.\u201d\n\nThe Bairnsdale Magistrates' Court is located in Bairnsdale, a city in East Gippsland, Victoria, where more than a dozen bushfires were burning at the same time late December 2019, according to this AFP report.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201c[Breaking] One of the arsonists who set off the Australian bushfires, a Chinese national, was arrested. The so-called climate change may in fact be another yellow peril.\n\n\"The Australian government has caught a deliberate arsonist from China. In order to retaliate against the Australian government for protecting a Chinese spy defected to Australia and influencing Taiwan's election, he set fires to multiple forests. As a result, firefighters worked their fingers to the bone.\n\n\"Up until now, more than 100 million wild animals in Australia have been killed by the biggest and most intense fire in human history. Some of the species are facing extinction.\u201d\n\nAt least 32 people, including three US firefighters, have died in Australia during deadly bushfires that started in September 2019, as reported here by AFP on January 23, 2020.\n\nThe same video and keyframes from it were also shared here and here on Facebook, here on Twitter and here on Instagram, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe video has been shared in a misleading context; a spokesperson for the Chinese consulate in Melbourne said it was not informed of any arson arrest involving a Chinese citizen in Australia; the video was captured as part of a report by Australian television channel 7NEWS, which did not mention the suspect\u2019s nationality.\n\nTranslated to English, a January 24 email from the Chinese consulate in Melbourne to AFP states: \"At the moment, our consulate has not received any notification from Victoria Police regarding the arrest of a Chinese citizen over arson in Australia.\"\n\nA keyword search on Google found this video filmed by and published on the verified Facebook account of Australian broadcaster 7NEWS Melbourne on January 2, 2020.\n\nThe clip in the misleading posts corresponds with the 7NEWS clip from the five-minute 10-second mark.\n\nBelow are two sets of screenshot comparison of keyframes from the video in the misleading post (L) and 7NEWS video (R):\n\nAFP found this tweet published on January 2, 2020, on the official account of Australia\u2019s Victoria Police about an arson arrest in the same area as mentioned in the 7NEWS video.\n\nThe tweet states: \u201cPolice arrested and charged a man last night following reports he allegedly started a small fire in Johnsonville about 6.45pm.\u201d\n\nVictoria Police\u2019s media officer Cameron Scott told AFP by email on January 17, 2020, that police would not confirm details of the suspect\u2019s nationality for privacy reasons.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that information on hand and we wouldn\u2019t be able to confirm due to the limitations of the Privacy Act,\u201d said Scott.\n\n\u201cI can tell you the accused will appear at the Bairnsdale Magistrates\u2019 Court on 1 April. The details you are looking for might come to light during this court hearing.\u201d\n\nThe man was described as Australian in reports published by the Latin Times here and the MailOnline, the website for UK-based newspaper The Daily Mail, here.", "lang": "en"}
