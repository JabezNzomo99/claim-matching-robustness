The sender asked us to check the authenticity of the letter as they were issuing the job offers in the name of Agriculture Ministry, Government of India. Another screenshot was also received where a job applicant was complaining in a consumer complaint forum (complaint 1 and complaint 2) that he paid money to \u2018Urbancroptc.org\u2019 and received an offer letter, but they are not responding to his calls thereafter. Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the offer letters being sent in the name of Agriculture Ministry. \n\n\n\nClaim: Central government jobs available under the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Scheme by Urbancroptc.org, which works with the Agriculture Ministry. Fact: There is no central government scheme with the name, \u2018Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Scheme\u2019. There is a scheme called \u2018Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme\u2019 but it comes under the Ministry of Rural Development and guarantees only unskilled work for a specific period (at least 100 days) in a financial year, not for 14 years. Also, there are a lot of spelling and grammatical mistakes in the offer letter and on the company\u2019s website. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the offer letter, it can be found that \u2018Ministry of Agriculture\u2019 was written on the letterhead. But, the Agriculture Ministry in India is called as \u201cMinistry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare\u201d, not \u201cMinistry of Agriculture\u201d. It was also written in the letter that the salaries and other benefits to the selected candidates would be provided under the \u2018Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Scheme\u2019 for fourteen years. So, when you search for the scheme, it was found that there is no scheme with that name. There is a scheme called \u2018Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme\u2019 but it is under the Ministry of Rural Development and guarantees only unskilled work for a specific period (at least 100 days) in a financial year for people in rural areas, not for 14 years.\n\nIn the offer letter and on the company\u2019s website, it can be seen that there are a lot of spelling and grammatical errors. No genuine reputed company, which works with the government, will have such errors.\n\nThe Company Registration Number is also given in the offer letter at the bottom. So, when searched for the company on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs website with the name \u2018urbancroptc\u2019, it was found that no such company was registered with the government.\n\nAlso, none of the phone numbers and social media hyperlinks given on their website are working. The address of the office is given as \u20183rd Floor-Kohinoor Plaza-Mumbai\u2019, which does not exist and is a modified version of the name of an iconic building \u2013 \u2018Kohinoor Square\u2019 (Mumbai).\n\nFACTLY has also contacted relevant officials in the Ministry and the screenshots of the letter were sent to them. This article will be updated once they respond.\n\nTo sum it up, \u2018Urbancroptc.org\u2019 is a dubious organization and the \u2018central government job offers\u2019 from them are fake.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
