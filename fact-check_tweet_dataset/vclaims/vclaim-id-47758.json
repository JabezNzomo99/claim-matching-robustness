It contains ethanol glycol that\u2019s also found in anti-freeze that\u2019s toxic to them!!\u201d\n\nThe post concludes: \u201cThey might lick the area you\u2019ve touched them. Please share to make others aware.\u201d\n\nThe post has been viewed over 200,000 times, shared over 3,600 times and attracted more than 30 comments.\n\nThe April 1 Facebook post claims that people should not touch dogs or other pets after using hand sanitiser because it \u201ccontains ethanol glycol, that\u2019s also found in anti-freeze\u201d.\n\nEthanol glycol is not a real chemical compound. The post may be referring to ethylene glycol, an industrial compound found in many consumer products including antifreeze. Ethylene glycol is toxic to humans and animals, with sufficient consumption of the substance sometimes proving fatal, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.\n\nEthylene glycol is not used in hand sanitiser formulations. Hand sanitisers authorised for sale in Australia in the form of hand rubs contain between 60-95% alcohol as ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, with small amount of other chemicals.\n\nHand sanitisers that claim to combat viruses are regulated as \u201ctherapeutic goods\u201d by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).\n\n\u201cEthylene glycol is not included as an ingredient in any hand sanitisers that are registered in the ARTG,\u201d a TGA spokesperson told AAP FactCheck via email.\n\nOther hand sanitisers made for domestic and personal use are classified as \u2018cosmetics\u2019 and the chemicals used in them are regulated by the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NINCAS).\n\nIn a statement to AAP FactCheck, a NINCAS spokesperson said: \u201cWe are unaware of any use of ethylene glycol in hand sanitisers\u201d.\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and a national shortage of hand sanitiser the TGA introduced legislation that relaxed the requirements for approval of hand sanitiser formulations. The newly formulated products must follow two recipes developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Neither recipe calls for the use of ethylene glycol.\n\nUniversity of Sydney Professor of Veterinary Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Jacqueline Norris told AAP FactCheck hand sanitiser can be dangerous for pets if they lick the substance off a person\u2019s hands directly after they have applied the rub.\n\n\u201cMost animals are adverse to licking hands with alcohol on it \u2014 fortunately the alcohol evaporates very quickly, but if they did (lick hand rub containing alcohol) it could cause central depression and vomiting mainly due to the high levels of alcohol,\u201d Professor Norris said.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the post to be misleading. Hand sanitisers do not contain ethylene glycol and only pose risks to animals if they lick hand sanitisers with high alcohol quantities off someone\u2019s hand directly after use. False \u2013 The primary claim of the content is factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
