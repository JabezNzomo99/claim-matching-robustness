Shawn Harrison, R-Tampa, told a reporter that Hogg and another student were \"actors\" who \"travel to various crisis (sic) when they happen.\"\n\nThe aide was fired, and the Broward County School District said Hogg and his classmate are \"absolutely students at Stoneman Douglas.\"\n\nHere are the facts.\n\nThe genesis of the \u2018crisis actor\u2019 claims\n\nConspiracy theorists have latched on to a CBS news video of Hogg in Los Angeles from 2017 as evidence that the teen might be a plant.\n\nHogg posted a video that showed an argument between his friend and a lifeguard on Redondo Beach. The argument was unrelated to guns.\n\nAfter Hogg\u2019s friend put a boogie board on a trash can on the beach, a lifeguard asked him to remove it. The friend complied with the lifeguard's request, but the interaction turned sour after the friend made a snide remark.\n\nHogg\u2019s video of the dispute went viral. CBS later interviewed Hogg about the dispute and the video.\n\nFrom there, websites like the conspiracy-minded Infowars reached for straws, including Hogg\u2019s appearance after the shooting on CBS This Morning.\n\n\"Interestingly, Hogg has reconnected with CBS for an appearance on CBS This Morning as the mainstream media unabashedly features high school students as figureheads for a new anti-gun push,\" InfoWars wrote in a blog.\n\nFolks on the internet took the claim one step further and claimed that the video was proof that Hogg was just pretending to be a high school student in a different state. At one point, the No. 1 trending video on YouTube was a video suggesting that Hogg was an actor, but the video has since been removed.\n\nHogg says he was visiting California, which is corroborated by his personal Twitter account.\n\n\"I love going to LA for the summer,\" he tweeted August 5, 2017.\n\nShortly after, on Aug. 10, 2017, Hogg posted a short vlog (video blog) on YouTube about his experience in California. And finally, The Eagle Eye, Marjory Stoneman Douglas' newsmagazine, published a story about his vacation and viral video.\n\nMore on the California connection\n\nSome social media users took the claim further and said that Hogg actually graduated from Redondo Shores High School in California.\n\nBut evidence that supported those theories \u2014 like a supposed yearbook photo of Hogg in California \u2014 was debunked by fellow Stoneman Douglas High students on Twitter.\n\nOne student, Sarah Chadwick, said that the images of Hogg allegedly pictured in a California yearbook were really from Stoneman High.\n\n\"She claims it\u2019s not a Douglas yearbook (which I promise it is, I know multiple people in that picture) yet there\u2019s someone in the pic wearing a douglas t-shirt????\" Chadwick tweeted.\n\nAnother Stoneman Douglas High alumnus tweeted a video, which showed him flipping to Hogg\u2019s photo in a Douglas yearbook.\n\n\"There\u2019s a photo going around claiming David Hogg did not attend Douglas, but a school in California. Here\u2019s a video to debunk that:\" tweeted Joey Wong.\n\nSome, meanwhile, have used Hogg\u2019s criticism about the FBI, combined with the fact that his father is a former FBI agent, to suggest some conspiracy aimed at hurting President Donald Trump.\n\nConspiracy-minded websites are claiming Stoneman Douglas High students are crisis actors hired to stir up controversy.\n\nNot only is there no credible evidence to support this claim, plenty of evidence contradicts it entirely. The school district has confirmed that the targeted students are, in fact, students. Broward County Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie and Stoneman High students on Twitter have confirmed that Hogg is a senior at Stoneman Douglas, not a crisis actor.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
