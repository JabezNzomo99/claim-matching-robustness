Another platform also published the story with the same headline.\n\nIn July, about 602 repentant Boko Haram members graduated from the Federal Government\u2019s de-radicalization program, otherwise dubbed Operation Safe Corridor.\n\nThe Punch newspaper published a feature on one of the rehabilitated Boko Haram members, Abdulwahab Usman. who admitted that he had killed many people. He, however, did not specify the victim\u2019s ethnicity or religion.\n\nReproducing the news, an online medium \u201cecocitynews\u201d on August, 2, published a version of the story with the headline \u201cI have killed many Christians to the extend, I can\u2019t remember the lives I have wasted \u2013 Freed Boko Haram member said.\u201d\n\nThe ecocitynews attributed the source of the story to Punch newspaper.\n\nBeing a religiously diverse country, unguided utterances and misinformation such as this has\n\nin the past resulted in religious violence and claimed lives, hence the need for a verification.\n\nGoing through the report from Punch, it was noted that Usman indeed submitted that he had killed many people, however, he did not specify the religion of his victims.\n\n\u201cI was forced into the group for about five years. I can\u2019t remember the number of people I killed as a Boko Haram member because they are many,\u201d Usman was quoted as saying by Punch.\n\nA closer look at the Ecocity News version shows that the headline of the story, which claimed that Usman had killed many Christians, did not align logically with the body of the story. So while the headline suggests the killing of Christains, Usman, never mentioned any of his victim\u2019s religion all through the story.\n\nFrom all indications, Ecocity News culled the story from Punch and gave it its own misleading headline.\n\nWhile Abdulwahab Usman, a de-radicalised Boko Haram insurgent, admitted to killing many people, he did not say he killed Christians. The headline of the story by Ecocity News is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
