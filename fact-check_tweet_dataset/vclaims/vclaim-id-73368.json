The claim is false; the image has been doctored from a photo of a Singapore Navy submarine to include the lottery numbers.\n\nThe image was included in this video published on Facebook on September 1, 2020.\n\nIt purports to show a submarine with the numbers \u201c99999-7\u201d printed on its side.\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201c\"This is where the [winning] lottery number came from. The previous winning numbers were found on the Prime Minister\u2019s car, and this time it\u2019s on a submarine. The draw is clearly a scam.\u201d\n\nThe winning numbers for the first prize in Thailand's National Lottery were announced on September 1, 2020 as 999997.\n\nIn June 2015, the same lottery made headlines after the last three digits of the winning numbers matched the licence plate numbers on Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha's vehicle.\n\nThe image was also shared here, here, here, here, and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the same image published here on the website of the Hong Kong-based newspaper Asia Times, on February 21, 2019.\n\nThe report is headlined \u201cSingapore launches next-gen submarine in Germany\u201d.\n\nThe report reads in part: \u201cThe Singapore Navy launched its first customized submarine, known as Invincible, in Germany this week in a ceremony attended by naval officials from both sides...The Invincible is the first of four customized submarines designed for operations in Singapore\u2019s shallow and busy tropical waters.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading Facebook post (L), and the photo in the Asia Times report (R):\n\nSingapore's acquisition of the German-made submarines was also reported by Singapore-based newspaper The Straits Times here and Channel News Asia here in 2019.", "lang": "en"}
