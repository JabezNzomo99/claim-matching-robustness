And perhaps one of the protection is against themselves. You know when you are 16 or 17, you are also hormonally very challenged. So, to protect you from your own hormonal outbursts, perhaps a certain protection, \u201cLakshman Rekha\u201d is drawn. Now you can make it 6, you can make it 7, you can make it 8, that depends from college to college, but it is really from your own safety point that it is given. It is not simply against rapists or against something else, it could also be against traffic accidents, it could also be against something else. If you choose to live with in the campus, then there are certain disciplines that every campus follows, and it is not just in India, but it is all over the world.\n\nNot only does the Minister recommend regressive measures to \u2018protect\u2019 women, she also thinks that \u2018hormonal outbursts\u2019 can happen only past 6 p.m. Earlier this year, in March 2016, Maneka Gandhi had also opposed marital rape being made an offence. In a written reply, she\u2019d said:\n\nIt is considered that the concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context due to various factors like level of education/illiteracy, poverty, myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs, mindset of the society to treat the marriage as a sacrament.\n\nFurther in the interview with NDTV, when a student asked if the issue could be solved by improving security in universities, Maneka Gandhi said:\n\nNo, it cannot be solved by putting two Bihari Gentleman on the gate with Dandas, it can\u2019t be solved liked that. It has to be solved literally by giving time limits for everything.\n\nApparently, Maneka Gandhi thinks that all security guards are \u2018Bihari gentlemen with Dandas\u2019. Such racist outlook of a Union Minister is disturbing.", "lang": "en"}
