Many of them shared an article by NDTV from 2019.\n\nSeveral other individuals on Twitter and Facebook promoted the claim. A Twitter user sent Alt News an infographic with text in Kannada claiming the same \u2013 \u201c52,000 \u0cb8\u0cbe\u0cb5\u0cbf\u0cb0 \u0c95\u0ccb\u0c9f\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cb3 \u0cac\u0cc3\u0cb9\u0ca4\u0ccd \u0cae\u0cca\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4 \u0ca6 \u0c95\u0cca\u0cb0\u0ccb\u0ca8 \u0ca7\u0ca8 \u0cb8\u0cb9\u0cbe\u0caf \u0caa\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0c95\u0c9f\u0cbf\u0cb8\u0cbf\u0ca6 \u0cae\u0cc1\u0cb8\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cbf\u0c82 \u0c89\u0ca7\u0ccd\u0caf\u0cae\u0cbf \u0c85\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0c82 * \u0caa\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cc7\u0cae\u0ccd \u0c9c\u0cc0 \u0c87\u0cb7\u0ccd\u0c9f\u0cc1 \u0cac\u0cc3\u0cb9\u0ca4\u0ccd \u0cae\u0cca\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4 \u0ca7\u0cbe\u0ca8 \u0cae\u0cbe\u0ca1\u0cc1\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0cbf\u0cb0\u0cc1\u0cb5\u0cc1\u0ca6\u0cc1 \u0cad\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ca4\u0ca6 \u0c87\u0ca4\u0cbf\u0cb9\u0cbe\u0cb8\u0ca6\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cc7 \u0c87\u0ca6\u0cc7 \u0cae\u0cca\u0ca6\u0cb2\u0cc1.\u201d\n\nAlt News spoke with a representative of Azim Premji Foundation and was informed that the news currently circulating is from March 2019. The claim about Premji donating Rs 50,000 crores is indeed true but the news is a one-year-old.\n\nA Google search with the figures \u2013 Rs 50,000 and Rs 52,000 crores \u2013 throws several articles including an NDTV March 2019 article. \u201cThe billionaire chairperson of Wipro Limited has just added to the billions of dollars worth he has already donated by committing 34 per cent of shares in his company \u2013 worth 7.5 billion dollars or 52,750 crores,\u201d reads the report published on March 15, 2019.\n\nAccording to the report , this donation last year brought the total value of his philanthropic donations to Rs 1,45,00 crores. \u201cThe Foundation\u2019s extensive fieldwork in education has been in some of the most disadvantaged parts of India, to help contribute to the improvement of quality and equity of the public (government) schooling system. All this work has been in close partnership with various State Governments. Currently, this fieldwork is spread across Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Puducherry, Telangana, and Madhya Pradesh, along with some work in the north-eastern states of India,\u201d said the press release by Azim Premji Foundation.\n\nOn April 1, Azim Premji Foundation and Wipro Ltd together contributed a sum of Rs 1,125 crore tackle the coronavirus crisis.\n\nTherefore, a year-old news item was passed off as a recent donation pledged by philanthropist Azim Premji in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Several prominent social media users, journalists and media outlets fell for the misinformation.\n\n[Update: The contribution made by Azim Premji Foundation on April 1, 2020 has been added to the report.]", "lang": "en"}
