Ted Cruz has talked tough on immigration, saying he would deport all 12 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nCNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer asked Cruz what is wrong with letting the \"good ones\" come back to the United States during the Feb. 25 GOP debate in Houston.\n\nCruz referenced a Feb. 9 Wall Street Journal article and said Arizona\u2019s strict immigration laws have prompted undocumented immigrants to flee the state. As a result, it has become tougher for business owners in the state to find skilled workers, but at the same time state spending decreased.\n\n\"Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state. ... Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Cruz said. \"And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop, are seeing wages rise. That's who we need to be fighting for.\"\n\nArizona is no stranger to controversy with some of its immigration laws. But has the departure of undocumented immigrants after legislation helped Arizona\u2019s economy to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars?\n\nBut first, some background on Arizona immigration policy.\n\nArizona\u2019s undocumented immigrant population was on the climb prior to 2007, according to a Pew Research Center study. The population peaked in 2007 with about 500,000 undocumented immigrants in-state.\n\nBut from 2007 to 2012, the undocumented immigrant population dropped 40 percent. However, immigrants across the state were already leaving because of the December 2007 recession.\n\nArizona\u2019s housing market crashed and construction jobs, one of the state\u2019s major sectors, dried up.\n\nImmigrants \"have left long before the passage of these anti-immigration laws,\" said Lisa Maga\u00f1a, an associate professor in the School of Transborder Studies at Arizona State University.\n\nArizona passed Proposition 200 in 2004, which requires citizenship to receive social services such as childcare and housing assistance.\n\nThe state passed Proposition 300 two years later, which bars in-state tuition for college students without a lawful immigration status.\n\nBut the meat of Arizona\u2019s policies toward undocumented immigrants did not start until 2008.\n\nArizona required employers to use the federal E-Verify system in 2008, which requires an employee to have a Social Security number to legally work.\n\nFinally, then-Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 into law in April 2010. The measure allowed law enforcement officers with \"reasonable suspicion\" to ask for a person\u2019s immigration papers when engaging in a stop. Most of the law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, but last September a U.S. District Court Judge upheld the law\u2019s provision that allows police to question the immigration status of those they suspect are undocumented.\n\nWelfare has \"never gone\" to undocumented immigrants, Liz Schott, a senior fellow and welfare expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said.\n\nHowever, some children of undocumented immigrants are eligible for benefits if they were born in the United States and are citizens.\n\nSteven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors reduced immigration, noted that these U.S.-born children could share their cash welfare benefits with their undocumented parents.\n\nIn 2008, Arizona spent more than $121 million in cash welfare. In 2014, they spent more than $32 million on cash welfare.\n\nAccording to Schott, Arizona just spends more in other welfare areas, such as child-care assistance for those working and/or attending school.\n\n\"They\u2019re spending it all, they\u2019re just spending it elsewhere,\" Schott said.\n\nBecause it is difficult to determine how many undocumented immigrants receive cash welfare, it\u2019s hard to credit this drop to people leaving the state.\n\nAs for state prisons, Arizona\u2019s Department of Corrections tracks noncitizens, either documented or undocumented, with a felony conviction.\n\nFrom fiscal year 2010, which ran from July 2009 to June 2010, to fiscal year 2015, the state\u2019s noncitizen prison population has declined almost 23 percent, but that\u2019s just about 1,400 inmates.\n\nThe daily cost of keeping a noncitizen in a state prison hasn\u2019t changed much, either.\n\nIn fiscal year 2010, it cost $59.85 per day to house a noncitizen. In fiscal year 2015, it cost $61.55. Because of the dip in noncitizen inmates, that\u2019s a savings of almost $28 million.\n\nHowever, overall state spending on prisons has increased almost 17 percent between 2008 and 2015.\n\nElliott Pollack, CEO of his own Scottsdale-based economic consulting firm, said Cruz\u2019s rationale bothers him.\n\n\"The cause and effect might be there to some extent, but I just don\u2019t see how it saves hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Pollack said. \"There\u2019s no evidence of that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Camarota said the departure of undocumented immigrants \"makes things a little better.\"\n\n\"Could he (Cruz) be right? He could be,\" Camarota said.\n\nHowever, Cruz\u2019s points are subject to error. Camarota also notes that undocumented immigrants \"paid something\" in taxes.\n\nA February 2016 report from the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that Arizona\u2019s undocumented immigrants pay more than $231 million a year in state and local taxes.\n\nOn education, the state also does not track spending on undocumented immigrants in schools.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal article Cruz described uses the state\u2019s decline in intensive English student enrollment -- about 80,000 students between 2008 and 2012 -- as a potential cost-saving measure, noting that it could save the state about $350 million per year.\n\nBut it\u2019s not that simple.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s a combination of factors,\" Arizona Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said, noting that the decline could be attributed to students leaving the system or being reclassified elsewhere.\n\nPlus, that measure correlates intensive English with undocumented immigrants, which isn\u2019t tracked to begin with.\n\nWe reached out to the Cruz campaign for comment but did not hear back.\n\nCruz said, \"spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars\" because of Arizona\u2019s exodus of undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhile it\u2019s technically possible to receive cash welfare through U.S.-born children, undocumented immigrants do not receive cash welfare directly. And, the state\u2019s prison and education budgets do not solely account for those without papers.\n\nEven then, any potential savings would be hard to calculate. It is not an apples to oranges comparison.\n\nThe recession played a significant role in Arizona\u2019s immigrant population decline, too. There\u2019s been no noticeable windfall in the state budget for welfare, education and prisons that we could document.\n\nWe rate Cruz\u2019s claim as Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
