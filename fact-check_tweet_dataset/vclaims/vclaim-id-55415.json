Another version also claims that she\u2019s already back in the UK and \u201cwill now be given a new identity\u201d.\n\nThere is no evidence for this story and no evidence to suggest it\u2019s anything but made up. The only source is some tweets from early September that give no evidence.\n\nCherie Blair\u2019s office confirmed to us that neither she nor her law firm represent or have ever represented Shamima Begum.\n\nThe solicitor who represented Ms Begum\u2019s family, Tasnime Akunjee, told Full Fact that he was working under the understanding that she was still in the al-Roj camp in Syria.\n\nHe said that neither her family nor her lawyer, Gareth Peirce, were \u201caware of her return or imminent return\u201d.\n\nGareth Peirce\u2019s law firm did not respond to Full Fact\u2019s request for comment.\n\nWe also asked the Home Office for comment, which it would not do on the record.\n\nThe legal grounds for her ability to return are unclear. Then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid revoked her British citizenship in February. The family\u2019s lawyer, Mr Akunjee, said at the time that she didn\u2019t have Bangladeshi citizenship. The Home Office said Mr Javid had \u201cthe power to deprive someone of their British citizenship where it would not render them stateless.\u201d\n\nIn early September, the Metropolitan Police lost their bid in court to view journalists\u2019 notes and material they did not broadcast from interviews with Shamima Begum earlier this year in Syria.\n\nThe post also claims that the press are banned from reporting on her claimed return. We are aware of no such ban. The post doesn\u2019t mention any particular type of ban, but we\u2019ve written more about so-called reporting bans or D-notices here.", "lang": "en"}
