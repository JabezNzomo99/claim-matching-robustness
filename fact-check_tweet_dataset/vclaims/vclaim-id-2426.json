One way it wants to do this is by putting up a centre to service aircraft.\n\nA centre to service aircraft - known in the industry as a \u201cmaintenance, repair and overhaul\u201d facility - would help make Kaduna a hub for both passengers and cargo,\n\n. It would also save airlines the millions of dollars that they spend on maintenance abroad, the governor\u2019s official handle\n\nIt is \"important to note that in the whole of Africa, there are only 3 maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities\u201d,\n\nDoes this claim get off the ground?\n\nNo word from state officials on source of claim\n\nAfrica Check contacted Kaduna state authorities and governor El-Rufai\u2019s aide on new media, Maryam Abubakar, for the source of their data, but we received no response.\n\nMichal Swoboda, a freelance aviation consultant based in Poland, told Africa Check that maintenance, repair and overhauls \u201ccan be very limited, basic tasks performed at an airport (line maintenance) or complex maintenance checks including structural work (base or heavy maintenance)\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, MRO facilities can be inhouse (affiliated to airlines) or independent, aviation analyst Daniella Horwitz told Africa Check. She has\n\nSuch facilities need to be approved by aviation authorities - either the national authority where it is located or general ones such as the\n\nMaintenance is tightly regulated by a UN agency, the\n\n, as non-compliance can have fatal consequences.\n\nIn Nigeria, the idea isn\u2019t a new one. The state of Akwa Ibom is reported\n\nIf aircraft checks and repairs were done locally, Nigeria could save US$500 million annually and create up to 10,000 jobs, a June 2017\n\nthat the country\u2019s states had more pressing concerns, such as building more schools and hospitals.\n\nNo facilities listed for Nigeria or West Africa\n\nof aircraft maintenance and repairs in the directory of\n\nThis directory is continuously updated as data is received from the companies, Paul Ellis, a UK-based retired pilot\n\n15 companies that offer both heavy and light maintenance in at least 6 different airports.\n\nhas seven in at least 3 airports, while\n\nhas six in at least 3 airports. None is listed for\n\nor any country in West Africa.\n\nAnother directory, that of the industry lobby\n\n, with seven of these owned by major African airlines. These companies perform base, component, line or engine checks and repairs out of about 15 airports on the continent.\n\n\u201cIf the Kaduna state government is thinking only of sub-Saharan Africa, and excluding South Africa, and counting just those MROs that provide third-party heavy (base) maintenance, he [the state government] might be correct. Otherwise, not!\u201d Ellis said.\n\n\u201cI do not think it is correct to say there are only three MRO facilities in the whole of Africa,\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are many small MRO facilities all over Africa, but they are not really hubs, as they probably only service one airline and tend to have one hangar.\u201d\n\nShe said that at the start of 2017, there were three major MRO hubs on the continent: in Johannesburg (South Africa), Nairobi (Kenya) and Addis Ababa (Ethiopia). These are big centres\n\nwhere airlines from other parts of the world come for aircraft maintenance and which generally have more than one operator for servicing.\n\na skills shortage and the lack of enough aircraft to sustain major\n\non the continent as key challenges for the region.\n\nConclusion: Africa has 3 aircraft maintenance hubs, but many more facilities\n\nNigeria\u2019s Kaduna state said that Africa has only three facilities to repair aircraft, as it made a case for building its own and become a key continental aviation player.\n\nBut aviation experts said the continent has more than three, with Africa Check counting nearly 50 firms that provide such services.\n\nSouth Africa, Kenya and Morocco have the highest number.\n\nIf Kaduna state were referring to major repair hubs it may have had a stronger case, as experts say there are currently three in the region.\n\nHowever, the governor\u2019s office specifically referred to \u201cfacilities\u201d, but we will be generous and rate the claim an exaggeration.\n\nExperts say there are more.Africa Check counted at least 49 providers Edited by Lee Mwiti", "lang": "en"}
