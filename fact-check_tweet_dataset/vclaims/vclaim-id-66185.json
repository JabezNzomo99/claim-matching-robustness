To me, Donald Trump is a modern civil rights icon.\"\n\nParks is credited as helping spark the civil rights movement after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955.\n\nParks died in 2005 at age 92. But she didn\u2019t have a daughter who spoke in support of Trump, because Parks never had any children. The photo with the story is actually of Ohio state lawmaker Nina Turner.\n\nThe story was originally posted on Aug. 19 on OurLandOfTheFree.com, a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we\u2019ve debunked, attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories.\n\nOurLandOfTheFree.com said at the bottom of its home page that the site\u2019s creators \"make no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not.\" Its About Us page noted, \"All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they\u2019re not.\"\n\nStories from sites like OurLandOfTheFree.com often are shared on other outlets, with no indication they are made up.\n\nNotably, the Republican Party of Virginia was fooled by this story. A volunteer for the group posted the original link on the party\u2019s Facebook page, but it was eventually removed.\n\nThis claim came from a website that fabricates all of its content.
