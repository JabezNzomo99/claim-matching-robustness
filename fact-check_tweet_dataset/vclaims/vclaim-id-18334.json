Yesterday at 3.30 am (early morning) it bloomed in Manas Sarovar, said the claim with the picture. Utpal Kumar Bose posted this claim on Facebook in 2016 but it has resurfaced again on social media. More than 16,000 people have shared it so far.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this claim to be completely wrong. This is not any rare Himalayan plant, but a marine invertebrate (animal without a backbone) known as a \"sea pen\".\n\nBy using a reverse image search, we found that the original photograph was taken by Gordon B Bowbrick in 2013.\n\nSea pen is a marine invertebrate more like corals, which belongs to 'Anthozoa' class.\n\nThe name sea pen derives from its resemblance to quill pens. They occur in shallow and deep waters from polar seas to the tropics.\n\nThe word 'Nagapushpa' is a Sanskrit word for a tree whose scientific name is 'Mesua ferrea'.\n\nThis is an evergreen tree and it even blooms during dry seasons every year.\n\nIn 2016, international fact-checking website Snopes debunked the same claim.\n\nThe claim about Nagapushpa blooming every 36 years in the Himalayas is wrong. Also, the viral picture is of a sea invertebrate, not of any plant.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: No, the viral photo of eco bridge is not from the Netherlands\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Bonhomie between Jews and Arabs in viral video is misleading", "lang": "en"}
