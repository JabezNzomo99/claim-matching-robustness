No, that's not true: the story was made up by a site that makes up stories about invented crimes and bizarre sex acts all the time for entertainment purposes. It did not happen, none of it is true.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on May 29, 2018 titled \"Retirement home raided by the FBI for running elderly fight club, 7 arrests\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSeven employees of a nursing home for elderly people were arrested by the FBI this morning in Charlottesville, Virginia, for forcing the elders under their care to fight each other. According to investigators, the 124 residents of the Retirement Village were forced to fight each other in order to obtain basic things such as food and medical treatments. The fights were filmed and relayed online on a specialized website, where they often attracted several thousand viewers and astounding amounts of money in bets. FBI spokesman, Bill Donovan, says the most popular fights were the ones in which contenders were \"armed\" with canes or walkers.\n\nThe screenshot illustrating the article is from a video that was online already in 2010:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: New Zealand Farmer NOT Arrested For Selling Sheep As Sex Slaves To ISIS\n\u2022 Fake News: Male Anal Rape Victim Did NOT Say 911 Operator Laughed At Him\n\u2022 Fake News: 17-year-old Teenager Did NOT Sue His Parents For Being Born White\n\u2022 Fake News: Babysitter NOT Arrested For Auctioning Kids Under Her Care On eBay\n\u2022 Fake News: Man's Hand NOT Cut Off For Masturbating During Ramadan In Saudi Arabia", "lang": "en"}
