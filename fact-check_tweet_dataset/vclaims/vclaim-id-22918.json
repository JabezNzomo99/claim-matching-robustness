The post further claims that, hot coconut juice has an effect on cysts and tumors. The message has been attributed to Dr. Rajendra A. Badwe of TATA Memorial Hospital. Vishvas News investigated and found that the claim is false.\n\nThe Facebook post claims that Dr. Badwe, Director, Tata Memorial Hospital clarified that hot coconut water kills cancer. The post further claimed that hot Coconut water releases an anti-cancer substance and hot coconut juice has an effect on cysts and tumors.\n\nWe started our investigation by breaking down various elements of the claim.\n\nAs per the viral claim, Dr. Badwe, Director, Tata Memorial Hospital clarified that hot coconut water kills cancer cells. Using relevant keywords (Dr. Badwe, Tata Memorial Hospital said hot coconut water kills cancer cells) we searched on Google whether the Director of Tata Memorial Hospital has given any such statement.\n\nWe found many news reports that stated doctors didn\u2019t say coconut water cures cancer. Here are some examples:\n\nAn article dated May 18, 2019, on timesofindia stated: The Tata Memorial Hospital statement on Thursday said the message was wrong as there was no scientific data to suggest that hot coconut water could cure cancer. Signed by Dr. Badwe, the message requested the public to not be misinformed by such harmful messages shared on social media.\n\nWe found another article dated May 17, 2019 by TheHindu that stated: Indian oncologists are increasingly battling unscientific miracle treatments for cancer shared widely on social media. On Thursday, Mumbai\u2019s Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), the country\u2019s premier cancer institute, issued a rebuttal on a strange cancer remedy attributed to them in a widely circulated WhatsApp message, which stated that hot coconut water can destroy cancer cells of all types.\n\n\u201cThere is no data to suggest that hot coconut water can provide cures for any type of cancer. Public are requested not to be misinformed by such false and harmful messages sent on social media,\u201d read a statement issued by the TMC\u2019s director Dr. Rajendra Badwe.\n\nAn article dated May 18, 2019 on Hindustantimes read: The director of Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Parel, has not endorsed hot coconut water as a cure for cancer, the hospital stated through a notice issued on Friday.\n\nThe clarification came after a message, saying that the director had made such a claim, started circulating on social media.\n\n\u201cWe would like to clarify to all concerned that this is a fake message and neither Dr [Rajendra] Badwe [the director] nor the TMH subscribe to this view. There is no data to suggest that hot coconut water can provide cure to any type of cancer. Public are requested not to be misinformed by false and harmful messages sent on social media,\u201d read the notice.\n\nOn reading through the articles it was clarified that the director of Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Parel, has not endorsed hot coconut water as a cure for cancer.\n\nWe further researched whether there is any study that states that coconut water kills cancer cells. We found a research at US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health. The paper stated that coconut water and vinegars have been reported to possess potential anti-tumour and immunostimulatory effects. However, the anti-tumour, anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory effects of coconut water vinegar have yet to be tested. Coconut water does have certain health benefits but nowhere it has been mentioned that hot coconut water can kill cancer cells.\n\nThe viral post also claims that coconut water is a proven remedy for all types of cancers. We further researched and found on Medical News Today, the hormones that help plants grow, also known as cytokinins, are also found in coconut water. These compounds are believed to have antiaging and cancer-fighting properties. However, to date no major studies have shown that coconut water wards off cancer.\n\nThe claim also states that add about 2 to 3 coconut flakes in a cup.. add hot water it will become alkaline water. Hot coconut water releases an anti-cancer substance.\n\nWe searched for any scientific study related to the same but could find any research.\n\nTo determine the truth, Vishvas News contacted Dr. Manish Singhal, Oncologist, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. He said, \u201cCuring cancer through coconut water is completely fake. It is a false gimmick!\u201d\n\nThis claim has been proven false by a cancer expert.\n\nAs per WebMd, Coconut water is commonly used as a beverage and as a solution for treating dehydration related to diarrhea or exercise. It is also tried for high blood pressure and to improve exercise performance.\n\nAlthough Coconut water has certain health benefits, but it is certainly cannot be scientifically proven that hot coconut water can kill cancer cells.\n\nAlthough coconut water has certain health benefits, but no research suggests that hot coconut water can kill cancer cells or cure all types of cancers. Also, Tata Memorial Hospital clarified that the message attributed to Dr. Badwe, the Director of Tata Memorial Hospital is fake.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
