Luther Strange, R-Ala., claims his opponent Roy Moore sought pay raises for politicians while the Alabama courts shut down due to a budget shortfall.\n\n\"FACT: Roy Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts had to shut down because of lack of funding,\" reads a claim on the Strange for Senate website.\n\nStrange and Moore face off in a Sept. 26 runoff vote for the Republican nomination to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general.\n\nIs it a fact that Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts shut down? We delved into the recent history of Alabama\u2019s court system to find out.\n\nDid Moore fight to give pay raises to two staffers?\n\nThe Strange for Senate website contains a footnote saying the pay raises went to \"two of (Moore\u2019s) top political staffers.\" The website also cites an Associated Press article from April 26, 2002, when Moore served as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, an elected position.\n\n\"Chief Justice Roy Moore gave pay raises to two of his top administrators this year as the state court system headed toward financial problems resulting in 170 layoffs,\" reads the article, which goes on to identify the pay raise recipients by name:\n\nScott Barnett, a lawyer who acts as spokesman for the court system, got a 2.5 percent merit raise in January that boosted his pay from $72,103 annually to $73,881, according to records kept by the Retirement System of Alabama.\n\nBoth men were appointed by Moore after he was elected chief justice in November 2000.\n\nWhen we reached out to Barnett, now an Alabama attorney in private practice, he disputed the notion that Moore was personally involved in giving him a pay raise in 2002. Barnett said it was a department head \u2014 not Moore \u2014 who recommended his merit raise.\n\n\"Judge Moore was not, to my knowledge, personally involved in decisions to grant merit pay raises to Administrative Office of Courts employees,\" Barnett said. \"The Alabama Administrative Office of Courts has its own personnel department that manages such issues.\"\n\nBarnett said that given the chief justice\u2019s role as the administrative head of the state's judicial system, it\u2019s unrealistic to think Moore would become involved in granular details like pay raises for individual court employees.\n\nBarnett added that, to the best of his knowledge, Moore would not even have needed to approve his pay raise.\n\nWe contacted two employees at Alabama\u2019s Administrative Office of Courts who corroborated Barnett\u2019s belief that Moore would not have needed to approve his pay raise.\n\n\"The chief justice would not have to approve a pay raise given to an employee, including a staff attorney, of the Administrative Office of Courts,\" Nathan Wilson, the assistant administrative director of courts and legal director of Alabama\u2019s Administrative Office of Courts, said in an email. (Officially, Barnett was staff attorney with the Alabama Administrative Office of Courts.)\n\nWhile Barnett received a 2.5 percent pay increase, he was eligible for 5 percent. This raises the question: If Chief Justice Moore had in fact \"fought for\" Barnett\u2019s raise, as Strange alleges, why did Barnett receive less than the full 5 percent increase?\n\nBarnett said he took issue with the amount at the time, and chalked it up to differences of opinion with his boss, the court\u2019s legal director \u2014 a position which we\u2019d note is subordinate to the chief justice.\n\nWith regard to Hobson, the other pay-raise recipient in question, court officials said his raise would have been approved by Moore.\n\nWe contacted Hobson, who now works as a consultant for Moore\u2019s Senate campaign. He said that while his pay raise did require Moore\u2019s approval, merit-based raises were \"standard operating procedure for deserving employees\" across the whole of Alabama\u2019s state government, which had some 34,500 employees in 2002, including some 2,500 judicial branch employees.\n\nWe found that nearly half of Alabama state government employees received a raise in 2002. That year, more than 15,000 state employees received a 5 percent merit raise, while another 1,300 received 2.5 percent merit raises, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHobson called it a distortion to say Moore \"fought\" to give him a pay raise.\n\n\"It\u2019s just not true,\" he said. \"I got a raise like everybody else who deserved one got a raise that year.\"\n\nWe contacted several election law experts and political scientists to ask if court employees like Hobson and Barnett are considered \"politicians.\"\n\n\"My understanding of a politician is someone who either holds or runs for elected office, or is an official of a political party,\" said James A. Gardner, a law professor at SUNY Buffalo Law School. \"I would not count civil servants as \u2018politicians.\u2019 Court administrators are civil servants.\"\n\nRichard Fording, a political science professor at the University of Alabama, said \"no reasonable person would refer to them as politicians.\"\n\nAlabama court officials told us appointees of the Administrative Office of Courts are considered \"state employees.\"\n\nBoth Barnett and Hobson told us they considered themselves court employees, not politicians.\n\nDid the pay raises coincide with the court shutdown?\n\nThe Strange for Senate website states that Moore fought for the pay raises during a court shutdown. (As an aside, we\u2019d note the differing language in the website footnote, which says Moore fought for the raises \"while budget difficulties confronted the courts.\")\n\nTo analyze this element of the claim requires some stage-setting. In 2002, a budget battle over Alabama court funding pitted the state\u2019s Democratically-controlled legislature and governor against Moore.\n\nAs the administrative head of the state's judicial system, Moore had requested $124.7 million from Alabama lawmakers. Instead, they approved $122 million, $2.7 million shy of Moore\u2019s request. The legislature ended its regular session on April 17 without appropriating the extra money Moore sought.\n\nThe next day, Moore\u2019s staff announced cost-cutting measures, including the curtailment of jury trials for five months. Notably, the Associated Press reported around this time that Moore \"told judges to continue merit raises promised through April 19,\" even as he ordered spending cuts. However, Alabama court officials said judicial branch merit raises were frozen after April 19.\n\nWe asked the Strange campaign if its claim applied to other pay raises than those given to Hobson and Barnett; a campaign aide indicated their claim concerned only those two employees.\n\nOn May 2, Moore ordered jury trials to resume, saying $500,000 in emergency funding provided by the governor would suffice. Jury trials resumed in June, according to the Birmingham News. (For his part, Hobson said he doesn\u2019t recall any jury trials actually being suspended, though we weren\u2019t able to independently verify this.)\n\nEither way, to the extent that Alabama courts were \"shut down,\" as the Strange campaign claims, it would have been from late April to some time in June 2002.\n\nBoth Barnett and Hobson say their pay raises came in January of that year, months before the budget fight reached a crescendo in spring.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Moore campaign backed up Hobson\u2019s claim that his pay bump came in January, though we were not able to independently verify the timing. An Associated Press article, citing records from the Retirement System of Alabama, corroborated Barnett\u2019s claim that his raise came in January.\n\nThe Strange campaign said, \"Roy Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts had to shut down because of lack of funding.\"\n\nOf the two pay raises at issue, Moore only needed to approve one. The notion that he needed to fight for these raises is undercut by the fact that nearly half of Alabama state government employees got raises that year.\n\nIn any event, experts we spoke to unanimously agreed the two pay raise recipients were not \"politicians.\"\n\nTo the extent that Alabama courts experienced a shutdown in 2002, it occurred months after at least one of the raises had been approved, and after Moore had publicly advocated for more funding for courts.", "lang": "en"}
