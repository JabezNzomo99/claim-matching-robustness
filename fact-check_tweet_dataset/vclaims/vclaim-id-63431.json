Odd days teachers will come and even days, students will come,\u201d reads the tweet. It suggests that Gandhi proposed the odd-even method to reopen schools while jokingly suggesting that teachers and students should come to school on different days.\n\nWhile the statement itself reads like a joke, some users have used it to mock Gandhi.\n\nWith a keyword search on Twitter, Alt News found that no such tweet has been put out by Rahul Gandhi. Moreover, there are no media reports claiming that he made the tweet. Considering Gandhi\u2019s political prominence, it is unlikely that such an absurd tweet went unnoticed.\n\nHowever, the most important point which highlights that the tweet is fake is the misalignment of the text and profile picture. In the comparison posted below, a screenshot of a recent tweet by Gandhi (top) has been juxtaposed with a screenshot of the morphed tweet (bottom).\n\nWe also found a tweet from May 12 which posted a similar message in the form of a joke. The message was not attributed to Rahul Gandhi when it initially started making the rounds on social media.\n\nTherefore, a fake tweet was circulated on messaging applications and social media platforms to mock Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Earlier, a morphed tweet was viral in Amit Shah\u2019s name, claiming that he said he has bone cancer.", "lang": "en"}
