No excuse for what you did. Absolutely disgusting.\u201d\n\nThe post shows photos of two women \u2013 supposedly the mother and grandmother \u2013 and a baby. It was published on 14 February 2019 and so far has been shared more than 1,900 times.\n\nIt comes after a baby was\n\nfrom a storm water drain in Durban in early February. Residents had heard faint cries coming from a manhole in the early hours of the morning. A rescue team took three hours to reach the infant girl who was then airlifted to hospital.\n\nBut details around the incident are still unclear. Initially,\n\ndenied that anyone had been arrested and cautioned readers about fake social media posts.\n\nOn 18 February, citing the police, it was\n\nthat a woman had been arrested for attempted murder in connection with the dumping of the baby.\n\nNo grandmother is mentioned in the report. There is no evidence that the women pictured in the Facebook post are involved in the crime. And a local community safety group has urged residents to stop circulating the picture.\n\n, if you suspect that a post may be false, or if a story has not been reported by other credible sources, it\u2019s best not to share. -", "lang": "en"}
