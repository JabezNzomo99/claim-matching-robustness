They pointed to a database maintained by the Vera Institute of Justice, which does show a 65 percent decrease in African Americans held from 1999 to 2006, compared with a 13 percent decrease in prisons. (Jails are for short-term stays, usually before trials, while prisons are for long-term detention, usually after trial.)\n\nWhen we looked at the Vera data for Hennepin, this is what jumped out at us: Just about all of the drop for jail incarcerations took place between 2000 and 2001. It fell in one year from a rate of 870 African Americans per 100,000 residents to 307 in 2001. After that, the rate basically flatlined: 342 in 2002, 262 in 2003, 269 in 2004, 320 in 2005, 287 in 2006, and 321 in 2007. (The data indicates it is collected on Feb. 1, so 2007 is effectively Klobuchar\u2019s last year.)\n\nIndeed, when we moved away from rates and looked just at raw numbers, we saw that the jail population did not change much from 2000 to 2001. The Vera website also breaks down the data according to white, African American, Latino, Asian and Native American. But whereas the five racial categories added up to 84 percent of the total jail population in 2000, they added up to just 46 percent of the population in 2001. That was primarily because the number of African Americans in the jail dropped by 380 people, or 63 percent. The number of white people also fell significantly: 170, or 39 percent.\n\n\u201cI dug into the source data,\u201d said Oliver Hinds, senior data scientist. \u201cIt seems that starting in 2001, Hennepin reported to the DOJ that about half of the people in their jail were of unknown race. This was not the case in 2000. This creates a false perception that both the number of white people and black people in the jail fell dramatically, while the total number of people in jail did not change very much. The 2006 data has the same issue.\u201d\n\nOf course, we\u2019ve been focusing on the trend in jail incarceration. The decline in the prison incarceration for African Americans, as we noted, was much lower. Jasmine Heiss, a spokeswoman for Vera, said the best measure of the impact of policy and practice changes on prison populations is the rate of admissions. \u201cPrison populations change slowly after a state implements all but the most drastic reforms, as most people are serving multiyear sentences,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 1999, the overall rate of prison admissions from Hennepin County to the state prison system was 168 people per 100,000 residents between the ages of 15 and 64. In 2006, Klobuchar\u2019s last full year in office, the overall rate of prison admissions was 169 people between the ages of 15 and 64.\n\n\u201cThe impact of prison incarceration on the county, therefore, remained virtually unchanged during Sen. Klobuchar\u2019s time in the county attorney\u2019s office,\u201d Heiss said. Still, between 1999 and 2006, the rate at which African Americans were admitted to the state prison system from Hennepin County decreased approximately 28 percent. But, she noted, African American prison admission rates were still 22 times higher than white prison admission rates in 2006.\n\nWe informed the Klobuchar campaign of our findings and received this statement from a campaign representative: \u201cThe senator was citing data from the Vera Institute, a reputable source and organization that is doing great work to improve our justice system. We have cited two stats from them relating to incarceration rates \u2014 one showing jail rates and another showing prison rates \u2014 and now that an anomaly with the jail rate has been discovered, we will use the prison rate moving forward.\u201d\n\nWhile Klobuchar relied on publicly available data from a credible source, we believe it should have been apparent to her that something was wrong with it. She claimed that the drop took place \u201cfrom the beginning of my term to the end.\u201d In reality, much of the drop took place in just one year \u2014 a year that should have been memorable to a prosecutor if such a change in the incarceration rate of African Americans actually had taken place.\n\nThe prison admission rate for African Americans did drop during her tenure, though how much credit she can claim is subject to dispute. (The population in jails is more closely associated with the policies of the local law enforcement.) The racial disparities remained huge. We wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios but ultimately tipped toward Four. On national television, Klobuchar claimed a figure that should have been unbelievable to herself.", "lang": "en"}
