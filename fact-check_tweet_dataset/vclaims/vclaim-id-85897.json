(The Fact Checker live-checked several claims for context during the speech.) This claim was the only reference to the state of the American criminal justice system in President Obama\u2019s speech.\n\nObama\u2019s claim was more general than Holder\u2019s, but they made the same point. Obama said: \u201cfor the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together.\u201d Holder announced during his September 2014 speech: \u201cSince President Obama took office, both overall crime and overall incarceration have decreased by approximately 10 percent. This is the first time these two critical markers have declined together in more than 40 years.\u201d\n\nThe national violent crime rate was 396 offenses per 100,000 people in 1971, and steadily increased until it peaked in 1991, at 758 offenses per 100,000. Then it began decreasing again, even though the overall population continued to grow. In 2013, the violent crime rate was 367.9 offenses per 100,000 people. The crime-rate decrease under the Obama administration is part of an ongoing trend over the past 20-plus years.\n\nThe overall rate for federal and state prison incarceration also decreased during the same time period. It was the first time both rates decreased since the early 1970s, records show. The key word is the \u201coverall\u201d rate. There are many ways to measure incarceration trends \u2014 for example: jail versus prison population, state prison versus federal prison population, and imprisoned population versus those under correctional supervision.\n\nSince Holder used overall state and federal prison incarceration rates, The Fact Checker analyzed the rate of prisoners sentenced to state and federal institutions, per 100,000 of the population. According to Bureau of Justice Statistics annual reports, the rate of state and federal prison incarcerations increased starting in 1973, then began decreasing around 2007. Since Obama took office, this rate has decreased by 4.8 percent. With jail populations included, the incarceration rate decreased even more \u2014 9 percent decrease from 2009 through 2013.\n\nNote that Obama uses crime and incarceration rates, not actual population numbers. The rate may decrease from year to year, but it does not always mean there were fewer people in prison. In 2013, the total number of prisoners in state and federal facilities increased over the 2012 total for the first increase since 2009. But because of the general population increase, the rate still decreased.\n\nDespite the recent decrease in incarceration rates, there has been a steady increase in state and federal prison populations since the 1970s. BJS reports show the 2013 rate of people sentenced to state and federal institutions was an increase of almost 400 percent from the rate in 1971. (In comparison, the 2013 crime rate is lower than it was in 1971.) This graphic illustrates the decades-long population increase:\n\nThe president listed accomplishments during his first six years in office. But some of the state-level changes that led to these rate decreases were underway or in place before 2009. (This anomaly, for example: California prisons had been overpopulated for a decade until the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011 mandated the state to reduce its prison population.)\n\nThe decrease in both rates is significant because it negates the long-held belief that crime would decrease at the expense of increased incarcerations, criminal justice experts said. But experts also were quick to warn: while it seems simple to connect the two rates, there is not as direct a relationship as some think. Incarceration rate climbed steadily since the 1970s despite the fluctuations in crime rates during the same period, noted Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project.\n\nConsistent with the nature of State of the Union claims, Obama\u2019s figures on crime and overall incarceration rates were accurate. But what he didn\u2019t say in reference to this topic is just as important. For example, the actual 2013 prison population increased for the first time since 2009, despite the rate decrease. While both rates decreased nationally, 40 percent of states did not experience the simultaneous change in 2008-2013. The president receives One Pinocchio for missing context.", "lang": "en"}
