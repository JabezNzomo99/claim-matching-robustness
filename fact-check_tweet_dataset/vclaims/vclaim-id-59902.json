Let\u2019s look at these one by one: BJP Leader Shares Old Image From Punjab As Flooding in Delhi We searched on YouTube using keywords \u201cBJP leader heckled\u201d and found a clearer version of the viral video uploaded by media outlet Prabhat Khabar in 2017. Prabhat Khabar had uploaded the same visuals in 2017. The description of the video mentioned that it showed the attack on BJP State President Dilip Ghosh and his supporters in Darjeeling. According to an article published by The Hindu in 2017, Ghosh and his supporters were allegedly assaulted by a group of locals in the Darjeeling Hills on 5 October 2017 while he was on a two-day visit to address a meeting. Ghosh had then alleged that supporters of rebel Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leader Binoy Tamang were behind the attack. The Quint had earlier debunked the visuals with a different claim in 2019.\n\nWe searched on YouTube using keywords \u201cBJP leader attacked\u201d and found a video uploaded by \u2018ANI News Official\u2019 with the caption: \u2018BJP leader Babul Supriyo attacked by TMC supporters\u2019. ANI had uploaded the video in 2016 mentioning that BJP leader Babul Supriyo was allegedly attacked by TMC supporters. The visuals seen in the viral video are same as that seen in the ANI video from 0:13- 0:17 seconds which was uploaded in 2016. The Quint, too, had then reported about the incident wherein Union Minister Babul Supriyo was allegedly attacked by a mob in Asansol, West Bengal in October 2016. Supriyo\u2019s vehicle was stopped allegedly by Trinamool Congress supporters near Asansol\u2019s BNR More and agitators pelted stones at him. According to reports, the mob even vandalised his vehicle and attacked two other BJP supporters who were accompanying Supriyo. Evidently, a compilation of two old incidents is going viral with the false claim that a BJP MLA was attacked in Bihar\u2019s Patna.", "lang": "en"}
