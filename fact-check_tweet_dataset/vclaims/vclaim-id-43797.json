While the original reporting focused on the trauma suffered by the child and the arrest of his parent, identified as Margarita \u201cN,\u201d later iterations included a wrinkle in the crime: The boy was supposedly murdered because he refused to wear a dress.\n\nIn December 2019, 10 months after the death of 7-year-old Karol R\u00e1mon, the website Newstarget.com reported that an \u201cLGBT-obsessed\u201d mother had beaten her son to death because he refused to dress like a girl:\n\nYet another innocent, underage boy has been brutally victimized by the Cult of LGBTQ for refusing to become one of them. Seven-year-old Karol R\u00e1mon, as the media is calling him, was reportedly \u201cbeaten with a belt, a chair, a whip and even a hammer\u201d by his lesbian mother, identified as Margarita, simply because he objected to her perverted fetish that he dress like a girl.\n\nThe assertion that this boy was beaten to death because he refused to wear a dress was not based on factual information. The Office of the Attorney General made no mention of clothing choice as a possible motive in the agency\u2019s March 2019 statement about the boy\u2019s death. A spokesperson for the Guanajuato Prosecutor\u2019s Office also told the news site AFP that the claim the boy was killed for refusing to wear a dress was not supported by evidence:\n\nThe tragic story was first reported on by local news outlets in March 2019, a few days after the boy was admitted to a private sanitarium and pronounced dead. Proceso.com.mx reported that hospital staff alerted authorities immediately after seeing the boy\u2019s gruesome injuries, and that his mother acknowledged to authorities she had \u201cinflicted so much physical abuse that the child\u2019s body did not resist.\u201d\n\nProceso\u2019s report also included a sentence about the boy\u2019s living situation that mentioned his mother was a lesbian. While this detail was not the focus of that news article, it eventually led to rumors about the nature of his death.\n\nA few days after Proceso\u2019s report, the website La Opinion published an article stating that a lesbian couple had beaten their son to death after he refused to wear a dress (translated via Google):\n\nA terrible crime has shocked the inhabitants of the community of Juventino Rosas in Guanajuato, and Mexico in general, claiming the life of a 7-year-old boy whose life was taken by his own mother and her same-sex partner, all because the child did not want to fulfill their whim. The minor, who was identified as Karol Ram\u00f3n, was constantly mistreated by his mother and her partner. But these women ended up giving him a brutal beating after the boy refused to dress in girls\u2019 clothes.\n\nLa Opinion cited no sources for the declaration that Karol was killed for refusing to wear a dress. Additionally, that article falsely stated that Margarita\u2019s partner was a \u201cfugitive\u201d and was wanted in connection with the boy\u2019s death. Although neither of these details was accurate, La Opinion\u2019s report was picked up and spread by a number of other news outlets.\n\nTabasco Hoy reprinted the La Opinion piece verbatim, and the erroneous report was also rehashed in an article published by ACI Prensa. On June 20, 2019, the story reached a larger English-speaking audience when the Daily Wire published an article headlined \u201cBoy, 7, Reportedly Beaten to Death by Mother for Refusing to Dress Like a Girl.\u201d\n\nThis version of events was spread widely, but the Guanajuato Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office stated no evidence supported it. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office also said no evidence linked the mother\u2019s partner to the crime.\n\nACI Prensa subsequently added a correction to its story: \u201cA previous version of this article indicated that a \u2018lesbian couple beat a child because he refused to dress as a woman\u2019 based on local media reports. The Guanajuato Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office based in Celaya told the Animal Politico website that only the child\u2019s mother, Margarita \u201cN,\u201d was involved and has no evidence that the motive was the child\u2019s clothing.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Wire added a similar update: \u201cAccording to a correction posted by ACI Prensa, the Guanajuato Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office reportedly said there is \u2018no evidence\u2019 that the motive for the child\u2019s murder was due to his clothing, contradicting local reports. The motive remains unclear.\u201d\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s office told La Republica that the boy was allegedly killed by his mother, that the mother\u2019s partner was not involved, and that there \u201cno basis\u201d existed to claim that the boy was killed because he would not dress like a girl:\n\nAccording to the investigation, the alleged murderer is the mother of Karol Ram\u00f3n. In declarations for the Republic, the Attorney General\u2019s Office of Guanajuato, Celaya headquarters, indicated that there is \u201cno element that establishes evidence to link your partner.\u201d In this way, the participation of \u2018Esmeralda\u2019 has been ruled out. Mexican institution also denied the information linking the clothing of the child with his death. To say he was killed \u201cbecause it would not dress like girl\u201d has no basis. \u201cIt is totally false,\u201d rejected the Attorney General of Guanajuato.", "lang": "en"}
