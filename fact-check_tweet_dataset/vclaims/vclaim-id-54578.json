Netizens are even accusing the duo of raping children. One such post on Twitter says, \u201cHey look @realDonaldTrump you and your pal before you raped some children #Epstein#TrumpOut2020#TrumpIsUnwell.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the image is doctored.\n\nThe picture is viral on WhatsApp too. The archived version of the Twitter post can be seen here.\n\nThere are several things about the picture that raise suspicion. Epstein\u2019s head appears to be out of proportion to the body. Also, on closely observing the picture, one can see a bunch of long smooth hair right beside Epstein\u2019s face, which again is out of proportion to his short curly hair.\n\nReverse-searching the photograph, we found the original picture with \u201cGetty Images\u201d wherein Trump is seen kissing his daughter Ivanka. The caption of the picture says it was taken in a limousine in 1990. Ivanka was 13 years old at that time.\n\nAll the elements in this image such as Trump\u2019s sitting position, his seatbelt and the remote kept on the car seat are exactly the same as the viral image. In the latter, Ivanka\u2019s face has been replaced with Epstein\u2019s. The image has been cropped and its quality is quite poor; perhaps edited in such a way so as to give the impression that the picture is old, and also to hide the flaws of a poorly done photoshop job.\n\nAmerican financier Jeffrey Epstein was accused of sex trafficking, and his case was among the most high-profile ones in the country. According to media reports, he died by suicide in a New York prison cell last year.\n\nAccording to a 2002 article by \u201cNew York\u201d magazine, Trump had said about Epstein, \u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it \u2014 Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\u201d\n\nBut the viral picture of Trump kissing Epstein is morphed. International fact-check website \u201cSnopes\u201d had also debunked the claim.", "lang": "en"}
