And is it a guide to what the UK might have to stump up if we wanted the same deal?\n\u2022 Norway makes \u00a3740 million (at current exchange rates) a year in payments linked to its relationship with the EU\n\u2022 The UK pays \u00a314,000 million a year to be a full member.\n\u2022 This translates to \u00a3140 per Norwegian, compared to \u00a3220 per Brit.\n\nIf the UK joined the EEA after it leaves the EU:\n\u2022 There would be some financial savings.\n\u2022 There would be some scope for negotiation on exactly how much the UK would have to pay.\n\u2022 There would still be significant financial costs.\n\nNorway pays into the EU programmes it is involved in, and gives out grants\n\nNorway\u2019s main payments are direct grants to poorer European countries, and participation fees for specific EU initiatives. Along with some other running costs, this will add up to around 890 million euros per year up until 2020, or \u00a3740 million at current exchange rates.\n\nThat figure doesn\u2019t include what Norway gets back.\n\nThe UK pays more per head for full membership\n\nThe UK\u2019s contribution to the EU budget as a fully paid-up member was set to be around \u00a3220 per head between 2015 and 2020, whereas Norway is set to put in around \u00a3140 per head.\n\nUnlike Norway, the UK contributes directly to the central EU budget. The size of its contribution is based on the size of its economy and its VAT income.\n\nThe UK was set to pay \u00a314,000 million per year in to the EU budget up to 2020, ignoring what it would get back. About \u00a34,500 million per year of the EU budget was earmarked for the UK public sector.\n\nSo the UK government was due to pay in about \u00a39,500 million each year on balance for its EU membership\u2014its \u2018net contribution\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to work out exactly how much Norway gets back from the EU\n\nThe Norwegian government doesn\u2019t regularly publish figures for its net contribution to the EU. It says that:\n\n\u201cIt is not possible to compare net payments between those of an EU Member State and those of a Non-Member state\u201d.\n\nThe House of Commons Library has estimated that, assuming that Norway didn\u2019t get a lot back, imitating its relationship with the EU would make the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU per head about 25% smaller.\n\nA more recent estimate from the think tank Open Europe says that the saving per head would be more like 12%.\n\nThe difference is largely down to taking into account research funding from the EU, which both British and Norwegian researchers get a lot of.\n\nNorway\u2019s payments and what they might mean for the UK\n\nNorway pays around \u20ac400 million a year in grants paid to some of the EU\u2019s poorer countries.\n\nWhile not formally a single market membership fee, this money is linked to trade relations with the EU.\n\nNorway\u2019s EU minister said last year that \u201cWe gain from being a member of the single market. That is correct and that is also why we are definitely prepared to contribute\u201d.\n\nSwitzerland has a series of treaties with the EU to be in parts of the single market, and also makes grant payments.\n\nSo the UK might be asked to pay similar grants if it wanted to be in the single market.\n\nThe other major cost to Norway of its relationship with the EU is for joining in particular bits of its work. For example, it pays its share to be part of the EU-run Erasmus student exchange programme.\n\nThe bill for Norway and other EEA countries joining in these EU programmes is calculated based on the size of their economies.\n\nThis suggests that if the UK took part in the same programmes, it could cost several billion a year.\n\nFuture payments into the EEA could be offset by the economic gains\n\nMost UK economists think that leaving the EU will be bad for the economy, but remaining part of the single market as an EEA member will be the least damaging option.\n\nThe membership fee, either to be an EU member or an EEA member, affects the public finances much less than changes to the wider economy.\n\nBut EEA membership might be seen as being in the letter rather than the spirit of the referendum vote. Among other things, it generally requires accepting free movement of people. The new government is reportedly against it.\n\nWe changed the conclusion at the top of the article as it did not reflect the main text.\n\nWe updated the article in light of a new estimate from Open Europe, and updated some of our own figures.", "lang": "en"}
