In fact, Bloomberg is a major Democratic donor who has given to this committee before.\n\nMichael Bloomberg, the wealthy former New York City mayor running for president in 2020, recently announced he would give $10 million to aid fellow Democrats in House races next year.\n\nThe donation, first made public in a Dec. 11 Washington Post story, was made to the House Majority PAC \u2014 an outside political action committee dedicated to expanding, or maintaining, Democratic control of the House.\n\nBut posts shared on Facebook claim that \u201cBloomberg says he will donate 10 million to House Dems if they vote to impeach Trump.\u201d He didn\u2019t say that.\n\nCaitlin Legacki, a spokeswoman for the super PAC, told us that the group received Bloomberg\u2019s donation on Dec. 16 \u2014 two days before the House voted on and passed two articles of impeachment. However, Legacki said Bloomberg does not control how that money will be used.\n\n\u201cThere were no strings attached, nor were there any conditions placed on the funds,\u201d Legacki told us by email. Legacki pointed out that the Post story noted that \u201cdecisions about the targeting and messaging\u201d funded by Bloomberg\u2019s contribution would be made by House Majority PAC.\n\n\u201cAt this point, no decisions have been made about how that money will be spent,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Bloomberg is a major donor to Democratic and liberal causes. He spent about $95 million in the 2018 cycle \u2014 much of it to his own super PAC, which poured money into electing Democratic congressional candidates.\n\nIn fact, he has given to the House Majority PAC before his most recent contribution. He gave nearly $2.8 million to the super PAC between 2014 and 2018, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe Post\u2019s story said that Bloomberg\u2019s money would help \u201cdefend vulnerable Democratic House members against paid Republican attacks on their support for impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\u201d But that is not the same as Bloomberg offering a \u201cquid-pro-quo,\u201d as one Facebook commenter called it.\n\nLooking to 2020, Democrats are seeking to support vulnerable incumbents who represent congressional districts that had voted for President Donald Trump in 2016. As a commentary piece published by the polling firm Rasmussen Reports observed after the 2018 elections, when the Democrats won the majority: \u201cRepublicans will need to make some of these new members one-term wonders to have any hope of retaking the House.\u201d\n\nThe Post story also referenced the fact that Republican groups recently committed \u201c$10 million\u201d in ads \u201cto attack Democratic members of Congress in their districts for embracing what one spot calls the \u2018impeachment charade\u2019 in lieu of other legislative priorities.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
