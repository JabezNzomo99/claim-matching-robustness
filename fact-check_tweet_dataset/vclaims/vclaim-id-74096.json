But the two states don\u2019t share a border. And the tweet isn\u2019t real.\n\nA screenshot of the fake tweet shows a July 4 time stamp. It appeared on Facebook a couple of days later. The full tweet reads:\n\n\"Thank you to the Great people of South Dakota. The state is doing a tremendous job with the coronavirus. I told the governor that everyone is fine without a mask. They just need to keep there border with California closed! That state is full of LOSERS!\"\n\nOne Facebook user who shared the tweet wrote, \"A president who can\u2019t bother to look at a map, has no clue where states are in relation to each other and is the most ignorant person to EVER be in the WH.\"\n\nThe tweet is fabricated. There is no record of it on Trump\u2019s Twitter timeline on July 4 or any other day, and it doesn\u2019t appear in Twitter searches for posts with that wording or in databases that track deleted tweets.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
