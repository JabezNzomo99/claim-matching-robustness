(Click here to read IFPRI's statement)\n\nBOOM breaks down how India\u2019s GHI numbers were misreported and what the ranking speaks about India\u2019s efforts in alleviating hunger.\n\nWhat is the Global Hunger Index?\n\nGHI is a tool to track long term progress made by countries in reducing hunger. The report detailing the rankings is published annually by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.\n\n1) Undernourishment \u2013 Measures share of population who are undernourished\n\n2) Child wasting \u2013 Measures share of children with low weight against their height\n\n3) Child stunting \u2013 Measures share of children with low height for their age\n\n4) Child mortality \u2013 Measures rate of deaths of children below the age of 5\n\nGHI defines \u2018hunger\u2019 as the deficiency of calories as well as micronutrients. GHI scores are at a 100 point scale with 0 being the best score and 100 the worst.\n\nWhy it's wrong to compare India's 2017 ranking (100) to its 2014 ranking (55)\n\u2022 India ranked 55 out of 76 countries in 2014. The ranking cannot be compared to GHI 2017 which includes 119 countries.\n\u2022 The GHI 2014 report did not include 44 countries with 'low hunger' scores (0-10). If these countries had been included, India\u2019s ranking in 2014 would have been 99 (55+44).\n\u2022 The formula to calculate the GHI score was revised in 2015. (In the earlier formula used between 2006-2014, 'child underweight' was used instead of the indicators - 'child wasting' and 'child stunting'.\n\u2022 Data sources for calculating 2017 GHI scores are from 2012-2016, of which the Congress was in power for two-and-a-half years.\n\nHow did India fare in 2017?\n\nIn 2017, India ranked 100 out of 119 countries with a score of 31.9. India\u2019s score falls in the \u2018serious\u2019 category. The report states \u2018India has consistently fallen into the upper half of the \"serious\u201d hunger levels category in the past few years.\u2019\n\u2022 4.8 / 100 children die before the age of 5\n\nAmong BRICS, India ranks the worst with a score of 31.9. Brazil scored 5.4, Russia \u2013 6.2, China \u2013 7.5 and South Africa \u2013 13.2.\n\nIndia also lagged many South Asian countries. Nepal scored \u2013 22, Myanmar \u2013 22.6, Sri Lanka \u2013 25.5 and Bangladesh \u2013 26.6. Only Pakistan (32.6) and Afghanistan (33.3) trail India.\n\nHow did India fare over the years?\n\nAlthough IFPRI discourages comparisons, it provided GHI scores for the years 1992, 2000, 2008 vs 2017. GHI scores for these years were recalculated using the revised 2015 formula. GHI scores prior to 2015 are not at all comparable with scores since 2015.\n\nNote: Lower the score, lower the hunger level. GHI score point scale is 0 \u2013 100\n\nGHI scores of India have lowered since 1992. In 2008 with a score of 35.9 India was at the lower end of \u2018alarming\u2019 category. Now in 2017, with a score of 31.9 India is still at the higher end of the \u2018serious\u2019 category.\n\nIndia\u2019s performance has been the worst in the indicator \u2018wasting\u2019. The GHI 2017 report shows that 21% or 1/5th of of Indian children (0-5) suffer from wasting and only three countries \u2013 Djibouti, Sri Lanka and South Sudan show prevalence of wasting above 20%. Child wasting measures share of children with low weight against their height, The report states that, \u2018India\u2019s child wasting rate has not substantially improved over the past 25 years.\n\nThough prevalence of stunting among children is quite high at 38.4%, it has drastically reduced over time.\n\nIFPRI said that countries should look carefully at their performance on the indicators that lie behind the GHI score. It also suggests that to improve its performance India needs to accelerate the progress made in larger states.", "lang": "en"}
