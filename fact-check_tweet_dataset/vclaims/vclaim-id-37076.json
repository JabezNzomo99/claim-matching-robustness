The post was made by a Facebook page Abhijit Raj who describes himself as a Congress politician. He has now taken down the image, however, its screenshot can be seen below.\n\nSeveral individual users also circulated the same imagery with the identical claim.\n\nThe photograph was also shared on Twitter.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe claim shared on social media is false. ABP News journalist Nidhi herself clarified the same via a tweet.\n\nNidhi did not cover her nose because of a smell of drugs from Chief Minister Raghubar Das but was merely rubbing her nose. This was earlier debunked by Dainik Bhaskar.", "lang": "en"}
