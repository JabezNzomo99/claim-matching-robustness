(RELATED: Does Trump Have No Financial Interests In Saudi Arabia?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that the Polish government has taken such action. Freedom of religion, including having places of worship, is protected under the Polish Constitution. A search of Polish legislation found no laws restricting the construction of mosques.\n\nThe Polish Embassy in London told Full Fact, a U.K.-based fact checking organization, that Poland had no policy of this nature.\n\nIn 2018, Polish parliament member Dominik Tarczynski tweeted two statements similar to the claim in the Facebook post. He made another comment to Breitbart the same year, saying that Saudi Arabia could build a mosque in Warsaw \u201conce they agree for Poland to build a cathedral in Saudi Arabia.\u201d These statements may have spurred the false claim that Poland refuses to allow the construction of mosques until the country can build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia.", "lang": "en"}
