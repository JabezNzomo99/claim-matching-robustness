It opened:\n\nFrance are to consider lowering the age of consent to as low as 11-years-old as the government draft a controversial new bill dealing with 'sexual coercion.' Is an 11-year-old girl old enough to agree to sex with an adult? That's the question French ministers are seriously considering, amid total outrage and revulsion by members of the public.\n\nThe entire article is more or less a garbled cut-and-paste job of an ABC News article. The key paragraph copied from that story is:\n\nFrance indeed does not have a legal definition of \"rape\" that doesn't involve coercion. But it does have a law that defines sex with a person under 15 as sexual abuse (\"atteinte sexuelle\") even if it is consensual. The problem for prosecutors trying to convict the two men who had sex with 11-year-olds was that they couldn't convict them of rape on top of that because they couldn't prove the coercion. Charging them with sexual abuse was all they could do but that carries a lesser sentence.\n\nWhat France is now considering is defining any sexual contact with people below a certain age as non-consensual, meaning it would automatically be considered rape. Debate is still raging if that age should be 13 or 15 or somewhere in between, but definitely not 11 as YourNewsWire claims. And having sex with someone under 15 but above the limit would still be considered sexual abuse even if it was consensual.\n\nThis isn't the first time YourNewsWire has published a fake article about the age of consent. Recently they wrote the EU was considering lowering the age of consent to 13 (based on an article copied from a satire website) so they don't seem to be very reliable when it comes to accurately reporting on these matters.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several other hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt.\n\nThe site was recently profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.", "lang": "en"}
