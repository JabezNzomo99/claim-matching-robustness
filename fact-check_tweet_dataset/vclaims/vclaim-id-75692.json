PolitiFact has fact-checked various incarnations of the statistic Carter uses as the basis of his claim. Speakers have ended up all over the Truth-O-Meter depending on how accurately they framed the results of the study upon which the numbers are based.\n\nPresident Barack Obama ended up on the Truth-O-Meter for his take on the numbers during his 2012 campaign. He got a ruling.\n\nCarter made a similar claim last year at a women\u2019s conference in Atlanta. He told the conference that women in the United States are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work. PolitiFact Georgia rated that statement .\n\nCarter\u2019s claim here is a bit different and more specific than the claim we checked last year. And this time, he was using the numbers to tout his book. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take another look.\n\nWe reached out to Carter, and his assistant, Steven Hochman, emailed this about Carter\u2019s television interview: \"In a conversation or an interview, sometimes we don\u2019t say all we want to say. In the United States for the same exact work, most women earn less than men. For full-time employees, the median annual earnings are about 23 percent less for women than for men.\"\n\nLet\u2019s start with a basic primer on wages and gender.\n\nExperts agree there is a gender-based wage gap. But it is not as simple as it seems. Differences in the life choices of men and women \u2014 such as women tending to leave the workforce when they have children \u2014 and other factors make it difficult to make simple comparisons.\n\nThe number Carter used in his TV interview comes from a U.S. Census Bureau study that looked at the total wages earned by male and female workers. The study found men\u2019s total wages were about 23 percent higher than the total amount of women's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours. The study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked.\n\nOther data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the -- yield smaller wage gaps.\n\nExperts say the figure, which is often used to bolster arguments for gender-based wage bias, is misleading. Advocates often use the Census Bureau report because it shows the largest wage gap.\n\nThe number does not take into account critical factors that could influence the figure, including specific occupation, time on the job and education level.\n\nAnd the gap drops dramatically if you compare men and women of similar education levels, job titles, time on the job and other relevant factors.\n\nEconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department. It found that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap vanished. It shrinks to the low single digits.\n\nCarter\u2019s public statements about the gender wage gap are also at odds with his book. On Page 168, Carter states that \"full-time female workers still earn about 23 percent less than men.\" There is no mention here of less pay for the \"same exact work.\"\n\nDuring his MSNBC interview, Carter took a legitimate statistic and described it in a way that makes it sound much more dramatic than it is. The 23 percent figure is real. But it does not factor in occupations held, hours worked or length of tenure.\n\nThat statistic does not refer to the pay of women doing \"the same exact work\" as men. There is a gender pay gap. But Carter vastly overstated it during his television interview.", "lang": "en"}
