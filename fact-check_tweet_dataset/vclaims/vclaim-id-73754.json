It said that 30 people would win P5,000 each, and another 5 customers would be chosen to win P10,000 each.\n\nThe post then added a link to the profile of Facebook page Palawan Pawnshop 35th Anniversary. As of writing, the post had over 6,100 shares, 47,000 comments, and 1,800 reactions. It is still racking up Facebook engagement as of August 24. The page also had 8,250 followers.\n\nThe page that posted the photo is not the official Facebook account of Palawan Pawnshop. The official account of the company is Palawan Pawnshop - Palawan Express Pera Padala. This is the Facebook page linked on the official website of the financial services shop.\n\nPalawan Pawnshop also issued an advisory on August 22, saying that they did not have an ongoing promo or giveaways. \u201cKapag kayo ay may makitang ibang account na may halos kaparehong pangalan at maging pati mga lalamanin, iyan ay peke at walang kaugnayan sa Palawan Pawnshop,\u201d the company warned its customers.\n\nPalawan Pawnshop launched its \u201cCashiyahan\u201d raffle promo on its official Facebook account on August 17, where it asked customers to comment on this specific post using a selfie and message of support to the company. The official Facebook page then livestreamed an event in the afternoon of the same day to pick the winners. The full set of winners can be found here.\n\nThe official account of the pawnshop also stressed that entries shouldn\u2019t contain any private information such as full name, card number, address, and contact number to avoid fraud and scams. It did not require customers to share their posts to various Facebook groups as the fake post said.\n\nThe photo used by the fake page in its post was also only taken from Palawan Pawnshop's official page. It was originally posted on August 16. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
