This would allow the country to keep supplying nearby countries with electricity.\n\nhas asked Ramaphosa\u2019s spokesperson, Khusela Diko, for the source of the claim, but she is yet to respond.\n\nis part of the\n\nin 2015 to oversee Eskom\u2019s turnaround. He said Eskom exported electricity to seven countries in southern Africa: Zimbabwe, Lesotho, eSwatini (formerly Swaziland), Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia.\n\n\u201cEskom has been adding new power generation capacity - for example, power units at Medupi, Kusile and Ingula that have been commissioned,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, electricity demand in South Africa is flat and is actually lower this year than in 2007.\u201d\n\nEskom\u2019s media department told ZimFact it had a \u201cfirm power supply agreement\u201d with Zimbabwe under which the country got 50 megawatts (MW) of electricity a day. Zimbabwe could also ask for more than that, as long as the electricity was available and the request made a day before.\n\nThis arrangement started on 1 April 2017 and will run to 31 March 2022. In Eskom\u2019s\n\n, exports to Zimbabwe added up to 2,250\n\nIt\u2019s import or lights out for Zimbabwe\n\n, said Zimbabwe also imported electricity from the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s power company and the Cahora Bassa hydropower plant in Mozambique.\n\n\u201cZimbabwe currently has low electricity demand but at its\n\n,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrently, most of our industries are functioning at low capacity. When our industry kick starts, demand will go up and Zimbabwe will experience a lot of load shedding.\u201d\n\nEbenhard said it \u201cmakes sense\u201d for Zimbabwe to import electricity. \u201c\n\nIts own power stations are badly maintained and don\u2019t produce enough electricity to meet local demand. If they did not import from Eskom they would have more blackouts.\u201d\n\nBut how long will Zimbabwe be able to rely on South Africa for the imports? Ebenhard said Eskom had extra power it could export - \u201cfor now, that is\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are reports that Eskom is struggling to contract enough coal to power its power stations. If those coal stockpiles continue to decline, then there may be problems in Eskom generating enough electricity.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Deal allows Zimbabwe to import at least 50 MW of electricity from SA daily\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa was asked in parliament for the details of a R33 billion loan from China.\n\nHe said the loan would help develop a new power plant so that South Africa could continue supplying electricity to the southern African region. He added that neighbouring Zimbabwe continued to import electricity from South Africa.\n\nZimbabwe imports 50 MW of electricity from South Africa every day, and may import more if extra power is available. This is in terms of a deal with Eskom, South Africa\u2019s power utility.\n\nThe deal runs from 2017 to 2022. But if Eskom has difficulty in getting all the coal it needs for its power plants, it may struggle to generate enough electricity. This could cause problems in the arrangement with Zimbabwe.", "lang": "en"}
