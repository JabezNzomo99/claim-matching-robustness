Contrary to the caption, Clooney appears to be briefly touching his stomach, not zipping up his pants.\n\nRather, it shows the men and someone else \u2014 we don\u2019t know who \u2014 on a boat on Lake Como in Italy with several other people, including Michelle Obama, Amal Clooney, Malia Obama, and other unidentified guests in 2019.\n\nIn photos published by the Daily Mail, different angles of the scene reveal that there are other people nearby but not in view in the image being shared on Facebook.\n\nSeveral media outlets covered the boat ride, including USA Today and The Today Show.", "lang": "en"}
