Several reports in Dutch and Belgian newspapers claimed this was the main reason on April 4, 2018 quoting a spokesperson for 999 Games, the company distributing the game.\n\nCorrection: In an earlier version of the headline above this article we said this was not the \"main\" reason and that the company said it was done for entirely different reasons. However given the latest statements by the company spokesperson we believe it is now more correct to say it was \"part\" of the reason so we have updated the wording of our title and our image caption accordingly.\n\nThe name change of the game already happened as early as 2015 according to this article on game review site Polygon:\n\nBut media reports about the supposed reason for the change have only now emerged in Belgian and Dutch newspapers. An exaple of the story is an article published on April 4, 2018 in Het Nieuwsblad titled \"'Kolonisten' van Catan? Dat mag niet meer\" (translation: \"Settlers of Catan? Not allowed any more\") wich we archived here and which opened:\n\nGames producer 999 Games has - quietly - changed the name of one of their most popular games: 'Settlers of Catan' is no more, from now on you just play 'Catan'. The games producer says they have been receiving complaints about the name of game for years. \"We would allegedly be going back to the white roots and were getting reminders about the Dutch colonial history. We were even accused of supporting the construction of Jewish settlements on the West Bank of the Jordan river\", according to Bert Calis, 999 Games spokesperson. The company wanted to get rid of that negative connotation, which was why the name of the game was quitely changed to 'Catan', without 'settlers'.\n\nLead Stories contacted 999 Games, the distributor of the game, and they issued following press release today denying this was the main reason for the name change (translated version):\n\nOn April 4th 2018 (newspaper) AD published an article about the name change of the board game \"The Settlers of Catan\". The story has been subsequently picked up by various media outlets. The new name has been changed to Catan in 2014 by the way. It is indeed true we received a few remarks in the past about the title \"The Settlers of ...\". Because we want to make fun games for everyone we always take criticism seriously. However the name Catan has been adopted for entirely different reasons. That is why the AD article in question is totally not relevant. Being one of the best selling board games in the past years Catan has grown into a world wide brand name that covers dozens of items. To be able to expand and protect the brand internationally the need grew for a internationally unified brand name for the main publisher and author. This name became \"Catan\" and it has been compulsorily applied worldwide since 2014. The discussion the AD brings into the world is unnecessary pot-stirring as far as we are concerned. The connection to our colonial past is unfounded and was never applicable.\n\nSo the company has officially denied that the complaints about the name were the main reason for the change. We asked 999 Games for comment on these quotes from their spokesperson in the AD article (archived here) because they do seem to suggest the complaints were also a factor in the decision:\n\nWe will update this article if we receive a response.\n\nWe also spoke with Peter Winterman of the AD, the journalist who wrote the original article. He stands by the quotes and told us he had been at a familiy gathering recently when he noticed the name change when somebody brought out the board game. He later contacted the spokesperson for the game company and got the quotes he printed in his article. He also noted that he was told the name change discussion started in 2012, well before the brand name decision mentioned in this morning's press release.\n\nUPDATE: The company spokesperson clarified to the AD the complaints about the word \"Settlers\" were actually a real factor in the decision:\n\nSpokesperson Bert Calis let us know in a clarification over the phone that the AD article is not incorrect but that he provided \"incomplete\" information to the newspaper yesterday. The 'negative connotation' of the word 'settlers' and the complaints about that were in fact reasons to change the name of the game. ,,But apparently there was another reason I didn't know about yesterday'', he says now. ,,We wanted to add that context with this press release.''", "lang": "en"}
