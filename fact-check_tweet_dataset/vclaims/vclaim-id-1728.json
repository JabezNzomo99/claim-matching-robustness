In remarks, Obama noted that the White House hosts an Iftar dinner each year, and said that the Eid event was a way to \u201cdo something a little different\u201d for his last year as president.\n\nBut this was a one-time engagement that the White House publicized, not \u201cone of Obama\u2019s most secretive rituals,\u201d as the Resistance story claimed.\n\nReaders shouldn\u2019t take the Resistance\u2019s claims at face value because the website admits to pushing fake news. A disclaimer on its \u201cabout us\u201d page says: \u201cThe Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real.\u201d\n\nThis time, however, the picture is the only real thing about the otherwise phony story. \n\n\n\nThis fake story fits a pattern we saw during Obama\u2019s presidency, with many viral claims saying or implying that he was Muslim, or otherwise questioning Obama\u2019s Christian faith.\n\nThe Resistance: The Last Line of Defense. \u201cAbout Us.\u201d Accessed 13 Jan 2017.\n\nStryker. \u201cObama Crushed After Trump Orders White House to Stop His Sickest Tradition.\u201d Thelastlineofdefense.org.
