Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Expressway seen in the video connects China with Pakistan. Fact: The bridge shown in the video is the 240 km long bridge highway that connects two Chinese cities Ya\u2019an and Xichang in Sichuan Province. Hence the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through the Invid, several keyframes were obtained. On using Google Reverse Image technique for each keyframe, a certain keyframe directed to the tweet by China\u2019s Xinhua News channel. This tweet embedded a video which describes the expressway. As per the video, the bridge in the video is the 240 km long Yaxi Expressway connecting Ya\u2019an city and Xichang city of Sichuan Province in China.\n\nTo sum it up, Yaxi Expressway in Sichuan of China is being falsely shared as the 880 km bridge highway connecting China with Pakistan", "lang": "en"}
