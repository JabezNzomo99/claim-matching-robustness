The claim is false; the image is a magnified photo of a weevil.\n\nThis Facebook post was published on March 8, 2020 alongside a link to a Youtube video.\n\nTranslated from Indonesian to English, the caption of the post reads: \u201cThe look of the coronavirus after being magnified 2,600x, God knows best\u201d.\n\nThe Arabic text across the top of the photo reads: \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak after being magnified 2,600 times.\u201d\n\nThe YouTube link in the post shows a two-minute and one-second video, titled: \u201cTake a look at the coronavirus outbreak magnified 2600 times and how to get rid of it.\u201d\n\nThe first four seconds of the video shows a photo of a creature.\n\nThe footage, posted on March 6, 2020, has been viewed more than 5,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading YouTube video:\n\nThe same photo, along with a similar claim, was also shared on Facebook here, where it was shared almost 80 times before it was removed.\n\nIt was also shared on Facebook here and on Twitter here, with a similar claim in Arabic. It was also shared with a similar claim in English here.\n\nThe novel coronavirus has killed more than 4,200 people and infected some 117,000 others in at least 100 countries. The majority of confirmed cases have been in China, where the disease was first identified in late 2019, according to this AFP report on March 11, 2020.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo shows a weevil.\n\nA Google reverse image search found the photo was first uploaded here on the Twitter account of an Arabic-language website, eheliosworld.com, on February 26, 2020.\n\nThe photo's caption reads: \u201cWeevils are from the Curculionoidea superfamily of beetles. They are quite small, measuring less than 6 millimetres (4 inch) and are herbivorous, with a particular love for flour, oats, barley and breakfast cereals.\u201d\n\nThe same photo was also posted with the same caption on the site's Facebook page here, on February 26, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the photo in the misleading post (L) and the photo posted on the Helios Twitter account (R):\n\nA weevil is not a virus. It is a type of insect from the family of Curculionidae, according to this article on Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\nThis and this video on the stock image website Shutterstock show similar images of the weevil, with a caption that says: \u201cTropical weevil from the Ecuadorian Amazon, close-up.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
