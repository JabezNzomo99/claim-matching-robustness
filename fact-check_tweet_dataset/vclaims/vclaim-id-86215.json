With North Korea continuing to engage in frequent provocations that threaten the stability of the United States and its Allies, the enduring strength of the Republic of Korea (ROK)-U. S. Alliance is paramount to the mission of the Combined Forces Command (CFC) and U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM).\u201d\n\nThe State Department says: \u201cThe United States and the R.O.K. [South Korea] share a long history of friendship and cooperation based on shared values and interests. The two countries work together to combat regional and global threats and to strengthen their economies. \u2026 The United States and the R.O.K. coordinate closely on the North Korean nuclear issue and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. As the R.O.K.\u2019s economy has developed (it joined the OECD in 1996), trade and investment ties have become an increasingly important aspect of the U.S.-R.O.K. relationship.\u201d\n\nThis is false. South Korea in 2018 paid the United States about $830 million under the burden-sharing agreement, covering approximately 40 percent of the cost of the U.S. deployment. So the total cost for the United States would be somewhere around $1.25 billion, not $5 billion. The U.S. share became greater than South Korea\u2019s in 2010.\n\n\u201cAlthough the U.S. spoke highly of the ROK\u2019s contribution for the alliance, it demanded the ROK to significantly increase the total amount of contributions corresponding to the ROK\u2019s national status and economic power,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in announcing the deal Feb. 10. \u201cHowever, the ROK Government agreed on an 8.2 percent increase, the same level as its defense budget increase for 2019, comprehensively taking into account USFK\u2019s contribution for the defense of the Korean Peninsula, the ROK\u2019s financial capability, and the security circumstances of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nTrump is not alone in raising concerns about the cost-sharing agreement. The Senate committee\u2019s report from 2013 noted that \u201ccontributions from the South Korean government \u2026 have not kept pace with U.S. costs\u201d and questioned several projects on which the funds were being spent at the time.\n\n\u201cU. S. contributions to the cost of maintaining forces in South Korea grew by more than $500 million between 2008 and 2012,\u201d according to then-Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee when the 2013 report was released. \u201cBy comparison, South Korea\u2019s contributions under the U.S.-Korea Special Measures Agreement grew by about $42 million during that same period.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, South Korea covered 90 percent of the cost of a new military base that came with a $10.8 billion price tag. It\u2019s the largest U.S. military base overseas. The country has increased its defense spending at a faster rate than the United States over the past decade, reaching $39 billion in 2017, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.", "lang": "en"}
