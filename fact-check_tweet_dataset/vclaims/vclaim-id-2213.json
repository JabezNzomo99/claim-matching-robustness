Vani Hari (FoodBabe) cites a couple of studies about the effects of glyphosate on animals. Are these studies legit? I was just wondering what your organization\u2019s take on this is. Also the organization in France has declared that glyphosate is carcinogenic. Any help understanding this issue would be great.\n\nMany of our readers have asked us to sort out the facts about whether glyphosate, the most used herbicide in the world by volume in 2015, causes cancer.\n\nOur readers often cited an article on FoodBabe.com, which outlines a report that found \u201calarming levels\u201d of glyphosate in various brands of cereal, cookies, chips and crackers. This article has spread through Facebook, with users sharing it roughly 2 million times.\n\nIn her post, Vani Hari of FoodBabe.com claims the report, commissioned by the environmental groups Food Democracy Now! and the Detox Project, shows \u201cmillions of people [are] being poisoned by\u201d glyphosate.\n\nHari also says that \u201c[i]ndependent research links glyphosate to cancer \u2026 and it has been deemed a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization,\u201d which are claims the report itself also makes.\n\nHari isn\u2019t wrong about findings by researchers at WHO. She also isn\u2019t wrong that glyphosate has been found in foods. But she doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nSome experts say that at very high doses glyphosate can cause cancer, but at low doses, typically found in foods, the herbicide is unlikely to cause the disease.\n\nIn March 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the cancer agency of WHO located in Lyon, France, did classify glyphosate as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d\n\nThe agency based its decision on \u201climited evidence for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate in humans\u201d and \u201csufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate in experimental animals.\u201d IARC also took into account \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that \u201cglyphosate or glyphosate-based formulations\u201d can be \u201cgenotoxic,\u201d which means it can damage genes. This damage may then lead to cancer.\n\nBut in May 2016, a group of pesticide residue experts at WHO and the United Nations also concluded that glyphosate is \u201cunlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans\u201d through their diets. These researchers noted that there\u2019s conflicting evidence on whether glyphosate leads to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes, in workers who handled the herbicide. They also pointed out that the \u201coverall weight of evidence indicates\u201d glyphosate isn\u2019t genotoxic in mammals at doses and routes \u201crelevant to human dietary exposure.\u201d\n\nAn FAQ page on WHO\u2019s website clarifies why the IARC\u2019s and the pesticide residue experts\u2019 conclusions aren\u2019t contradictory.\n\nThe 2015 IARC conclusion aimed to identify any potential cancer hazard glyphosate may pose to humans at some level of exposure, WHO explains. But in 2016, the pesticide residue experts at WHO and the U.N. assessed the actual cancer risk the herbicide poses to consumers at a specific level of exposure, namely the level commonly found in foods.\n\n\u201cThe same chemical can have different effects at different doses, which depends on how much of the chemical a person is exposed to,\u201d WHO adds. \u201cIt can also depend on the route by which the exposure occurs, e.g. ingestion, inhalation or injection.\u201d\n\nIARC and the pesticide residue experts also looked at different sets of data to make their conclusions. For example, IARC only took into consideration published research when making its conclusions, while the pesticide residue researchers also considered unpublished data.\n\nIn fact, a yet-to-be-published study that found no link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, may have changed IARC\u2019s 2015 analysis of the herbicide had it been published.\n\nAaron Blair, an emeritus scientist at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, who contributed to the unpublished study and led IARC\u2019s review of glyphosate, said the study \u201cwould have made it less likely that glyphosate would meet the agency\u2019s criteria for being classed as \u2018probably carcinogenic,\u2019\u201d reported Reuters in June 2017.\n\nHowever, IARC declined to comment on whether the unpublished study might have changed the agency\u2019s analysis in an email to Reuters.\n\nThe research came from the Agricultural Health Study, a primarily National Institutes of Health-run project that looks at cancer prevalence and other health issues in over 89,000 farmers and their spouses in Iowa and North Carolina.\n\nOther agencies also have weighed in on the potential glyphosate-cancer link.\n\nThe European Chemicals Agency, for example, concluded in March 2017 that \u201cthe available scientific evidence did not meet the criteria to classify glyphosate as a carcinogen.\u201d This assessment, like IARC\u2019s, looked for any potential cancer hazard glyphosate may pose to humans at any dose, not the actual cancer risk it poses at a specific dose.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has yet to complete a final assessment about glyphosate, however.\n\nHow Much Is Too Much?\n\nDifferent agencies use slightly different measures to assess how much glyphosate a person can be exposed to without incurring health risks. The U.N./WHO and the European Food Safety Authority assessments both use an \u201cacceptable daily intake\u201d measure, while the EPA uses a \u201cchronic reference dose.\u201d\n\nThe EPA defines \u201cchronic reference dose\u201d as a level of exposure over an extended period of time, usually a lifetime, that causes a low likelihood of risk, while an \u201cacceptable daily intake\u201d aims to measure the level of extended exposure that results in no risk.\n\nIn 2002, the EPA said glyphosate\u2019s chronic reference dose shouldn\u2019t exceed 1.75 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day. However, it\u2019s important to point out that the agency didn\u2019t set this amount specifically for cancer, but health effects in general.\n\nMeasures specific to cancer risk have specified lower doses \u2013 a daily intake no more than 1 mg/kg of body weight per day, according to the May 2016 assessment by U.N. and WHO experts, and 0.5 mg/kg of body weight per day, according to the European Food Safety Authority in 2015.\n\nBy the European Food Safety Authority\u2019s standard \u2014 the strictest of the three \u2014 a 175-pound adult could ingest nearly 40 mg of glyphosate a day without a risk of developing cancer. Alternatively, a child of half that weight could ingest 20 mg of glyphosate a day.\n\nThis brings us to how much glyphosate the report highlighted by FoodBabe.com found in common brands of cereal, cookies and crackers.\n\nThe report says the cereal Cheerios had the highest level of glyphosate out of any product at as much as 1,125.3 parts per billion. That translates to about 0.032 mg per 28 gram serving of the cereal.\n\nIn order to max out the acceptable daily intake of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight per day, a 175-pound adult would have to eat more than 1270 servings of the cereal a day. And a child of half that weight would have to eat more than 635 servings.\n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that the report says Cheerios had levels of glyphosate \u201cas high as\u201d 1,125.3 ppb, which means that other samples (though how many, the report doesn\u2019t say) of the cereal had lower quantities.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to point out that individuals can be exposed to glyphosate through other sources as well, such as drinking water.\n\nAccording to WHO, food and water are the \u201cmain routes of exposure\u201d to glyphosate for the general population (as in, not pesticide applicators). But WHO adds that \u201cthe major source of exposure to glyphosate is expected to be food\u201d because of the way the chemical interacts in solids and liquids.\n\nSo yes, glyphosate is found in some foods, but experts believe these doses of the herbicide don\u2019t pose a cancer risk to humans.\n\nWhat About the Studies Food Babe Cites?\n\nOur reader also asked us if the studies that Hari, or Food Babe, cites in her article are \u201clegit.\u201d They are legit, but they don\u2019t specifically concern glyphosate exposure through food.\n\nThe first source Hari cites is a 1994, and thus outdated, assessment of glyphosate by the International Programme on Chemical Safety, of which WHO is part.\n\nHari also points to a 2014 review of the scientific literature published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. These researchers did find evidence to suggest that glyphosate exposure at some workplaces is associated with one form of cancer, B cell lymphoma.\n\nA third study Hari cites, published in the journal Cancer in 1999, found that occupational exposure to glyphosate and other herbicides \u201cyielded increased risks\u201d for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But the authors of that study add that \u201cdefinite conclusions cannot be drawn for\u201d glyphosate because their sample was too small.\n\nAnother study Hari cites, published in Environmental Health Perspectives in 2005, used data gathered from the NIH\u2019s Agricultural Health Study, which at the time involved 57,311 licensed pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina.\n\nThe researchers concluded: \u201cGlyphosate exposure was not associated with cancer incidence overall or with most of the cancer subtypes we studied,\u201d including non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But they did find that exposure to glyphosate was associated with a \u201cmore than 2-fold increased risk of multiple myeloma,\u201d a form of bone cancer. However, the association was based on \u201ca small number of cases,\u201d they wrote.\n\nOne last source Hari cites is a 2003 study on rats published in the journal Toxicology Letters that looks at the teratogenic, not the carcinogenic, potential of Roundup, not just glyphosate alone. When a substance is teratogenic, it causes developmental issues, not cancer. Monsanto\u2019s Roundup is one of many glyphosate-based herbicides currently on the market.\n\nThe researchers did find that Roundup had teratogenic potential. But they gave rats much more of the herbicide than a member of the general public would consume through food \u2014 between 500 and 1,000 mg of Roundup over a nine-day period.\n\nBut that\u2019s still not the end of the story.\n\nGlyphosate is considered the active chemical in many herbicides, such as Monsanto\u2019s Roundup, but it\u2019s not the only chemical. Though research is sparse, there\u2019s evidence to suggest these other chemicals may make glyphosate more toxic than it is on its own.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for independent researchers to study the health and environmental effects of these other chemicals because most manufacturers of glyphosate-based herbicides consider their formulations proprietary, or trade secrets, explains Michael T. Meyer, a geochemist at the U.S. Geological Survey, and others in an December 2013 paper published in the Journal of Chromatography A.\n\nBut researchers have looked at one chemical \u2014 polyoxyethylene tallow amine, or POEA \u2014 which is surfactant in many glyphosate formulations. POEA increases the glyphosate\u2019s ability to penetrate plant leaves, thereby making the herbicide more effective. It\u2019s also used in a number of other products, such as cleaners and degreasers.\n\nMeyer and his group point out in their paper that \u201cstudies have shown POEA to be harmful to a variety of aquatic wildlife.\u201d Despite this evidence, the EPA calls POEA an \u201cinert ingredient\u201d in glyphosate-based formulations, the researchers add.\n\nThis raises an important question \u2014 even if low levels of glyphosate alone in food may not cause cancer, could low levels of Roundup and other glyphosate-based formulations in food cause cancer?\n\nUnfortunately, that question remains unanswered. And Monsanto, which manufactures Roundup, has admitted as much. A law firm involved in a suit against Monsanto released emails in which Monsanto executives discussed the topic, reported the New York Times on Aug. 1.\n\nIn 2003, Donna Farmer, a scientist at Monsanto, wrote in an email to colleagues: \u201c[Y]ou cannot say that Roundup is not a carcinogen\u2026we have not done the necessary testing on the formulation to make that statement,\u201d adding that the \u201ctesting on the formulations are not anywhere near the level of the active ingredient.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, William F. Heydens, the product safety assessment strategy lead at Monsanto, also wrote in an email to Farmer: \u201c[W]hat I\u2019ve been hearing from you is that \u2026 Glyphosate is OK but the formulated product (and thus the surfactant) does the damage.\u201d\n\nIn response to the release of emails, Scott Partridge, vice president of global strategy for Monsanto, told the Times: \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing are some cherry-picked things that can be made to look bad,\u201d adding, \u201c[b]ut the substance and the science are not affected by this.\u201d\n\nStill, multiple studies do suggest that glyphosate-based formulations can be more toxic than glyphosate alone. However, these studies are not definitive evidence that the formulations cause cancer in humans. More research still needs to be done.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.\n\nGuyton, Kathryn Z., et al. \u201cCarcinogenicity of tetrachlorvinphos, parathion, malathion, diazinon, and glyphosate.\u201d The Lancet: Oncology.
