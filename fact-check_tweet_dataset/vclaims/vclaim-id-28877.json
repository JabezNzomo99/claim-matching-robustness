The article claims that a mother\u2019s genetics determine how clever her children are. The father makes no difference.\n\n\u201cWomen are more likely to transmit intelligence genes to their children because they are carried on the X chromosomes and women have two of these while men only have one,\u201d the\n\nIt says \u201cscientists\u201d believe the genes for advanced cognitive function inherited from the father may be automatically deactivated.\n\n\u201cA category of genes known as \u2018conditioned genes\u2019 are thought to work only if they come from the mother in some cases and the father in other cases. Intelligence is believed to be among the conditioned genes that have come from the mother.\u201d\n\nTellingly, the article doesn\u2019t give its sources, simply crediting its claims to \u201cresearchers\u201d and \u201cscientists.\u201d\n\n, about the claim. Skuse heads the behavioural and brain sciences unit at the\n\nHe said X-linked genes are linked to brain development \u2013 but not intelligence. And women get one of their two X chromosomes from their father.\n\n\u201cWhilst it is true that X-linked genes are relatively highly specialised for brain development relative to other genes from the rest of the genome, that does not equate to intelligence,\u201d he told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cOnly one X chromosome is active in each cell of the female, despite her possession of two X chromosomes, and one of the X chromosomes comes from the father! Males get their single X from the mother of course. The logic behind this statement seems to be deeply flawed,\u201d he said.\n\n(XX) and males have a single X and a single Y chromosome (XY) \u2013 as do all other mammals.\n\nThe claim has been debunked by science journalist\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this out of the way: Intelligence\n\n,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhile maybe half of our intelligence as we currently define and measure it is inherited, that proportion is in turn fractured into many many genetic variants scattered across our genomes.\u201d\n\nExtra X-linked variants may be shut down\n\nShe explains that mothers pass on one X chromosome to their children, and fathers pass on either an X (to a daughter) or a Y (to a son).\n\nAnd only one X chromosome is genetically active in female cells.\n\n\u201cMothers do tend to have two X chromosomes, but they aren't identical chromosomes, and of course, they got one of them from their fathers. Mothers generally pass only one X to their children and those children in turn receive the second sex chromosome (X or Y) from their fathers.\n\n\u201cWhatever is on the X can pass from mother to child or father to (usually) daughter, but the two X chromosomes the mother has aren't the same and don't at all automatically double the odds of inheriting a specific variant.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, inheriting an X-linked gene variant is not a guarantee that it will be used because they may be deactivated.\n\n\u201cThe doubled \u2018gene dosage\u2019 for people with two (or more) X chromosomes is adjusted downward in a clever way: each cell turns off most of one X or the other. So inheriting an X-linked gene variant isn't a guarantee that it will even be used because some cells might just shut it down.\u201d\n\nby Africa Check, professor of metabolic medicine Fredrik Karpe told us that measured smartness of kids is even more determined by cultural, economic and social environment factors.\n\nThe claim has also been checked by\n\nand found to be unproven.\n\n, influenced by many different genetic and environmental factors.
