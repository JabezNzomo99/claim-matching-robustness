In meme form the page shared a screenshot of what was purportedly the text of Public Law 107-296, captioned: \u201cHERE IT IS. PASSED BY THE DEMOCRATS. ENOUGH OF THE LIES, DECEIT, & FAKE NEWS[.]\u201d\n\nObscured in the meme was the full title of Public Law 107-296, \u201cH.R.5005 \u2014 Homeland Security Act of 2002.\u201d A primary claim of the meme was that the legislation in question was passed \u201cby the Democrats\u201d; in fact, the bill was passed by the 107th Congress in November 2002. The 107th Congress met from 3 January 2001 until 2 January 2003, during which time the September 11th attacks occurred in 2001. On the date of Public Law 107-296\u2019s passage (25 November 2002), Senate.gov provided its majority as Republican, not Democrat:\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor was Rep. Richard Armey of Texas (a Republican). The bill had 118 co-sponsors, of whom 114 were Republicans and four were Democrats. Neither metric (majority or bill sponsors) indicated the bill was passed \u201cby Democrats.\u201d\n\nWho passed the law was part of the meme, the other being a suggestion that Public Law 107-296 mandated the separation of children from their parents at the border. The screenshot featured depicted the tail end of the portion titled \u201cSubtitle E\u2014Citizenship and Immigration Services\u201d (highlighted), and the following \u201cSubtitle F\u2014General Immigration Provisions.\u201d The section depicted pertained to \u201cSEC. 451. ESTABLISHMENT OF BUREAU OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES,\u201d which broadly established a Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services\u201d within the Department of Homeland Security:\n\nIn March 2003, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were formed to carry out the enforcement provisions of Public Law 107-296 (Homeland Security Act of 2002). The provisions of the law were broadened in scope after the bill was passed.\n\nThe snapshot displayed the \u201cdefinitions\u201d portion of Subtitle E (the italicized part was not shown in the meme):\n\n(3) TRANSFER AND ALLOCATION OF APPROPRIATIONS AND PERSONNEL.\u2014The personnel of the Department of Justice employed in connection with the functions transferred by this section, and the assets, liabilities, contracts, property, records, and unexpended balance of appropriations, authorizations, allocations, and other funds employed, held, used, arising from, available to, or to be made available to, the Immigration and Naturalization Service in connection with the functions transferred by this section, subject to section 202 of the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950, shall be transferred to the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement for allocation to the appropriate component of the Department of Health and Human Services. Unexpended funds transferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be used only for the purposes for which the funds were originally authorized and appropriated. (g) DEFINITIONS.\u2014As used in this section\u2014 (1) the term \u201cplacement\u201d means the placement of an unaccompanied alien child in either a detention facility or an alternative to such a facility; and (2) the term \u201cunaccompanied alien child\u201d means a child who\u2014\n\n (A) has no lawful immigration status in the United States;\n\n (B) has not attained 18 years of age; and\n\n (C) with respect to whom\u2014\n\n (i) there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States; or\n\n (ii) no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody.\n\nSimply put, Subtitle E of Public Law 107-296 (establishing the Department of Homeland Security, DHS) placed immigration and related functions in the scope of the newly established agency. Section G of Subtitle E defined the term \u201cunaccompanied alien child\u201d as a minor under the age of 18, lacking lawful immigration status in the US, and primarily, an individual for whom \u201cthere is no parent or legal guardian in the United States\u201d or \u201cno parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody.\u201d This did not mandate that children be separated from their families, but instead, created a legal classification for children with no parent or guardian present or for whom no parent or legal guardian was available to provide care and custody.\n\nDebate surrounding Public Law 107-296 was ill-defined, with many simply sharing the screenshot as a vague indication the policy of family separation came before the debate about it in May and June 2018. Many attributed its passage to Democrat lawmakers. However, the bill was passed in November 2002 under a Republican majority, and it simply defined an \u201cunaccompanied alien child\u201d as one with no available parent or guardian. It made no provision for separating a child from parents or legal guardians or for detaining any child separated by DHS agencies from their parent, and it was primarily passed by Republicans.", "lang": "en"}
