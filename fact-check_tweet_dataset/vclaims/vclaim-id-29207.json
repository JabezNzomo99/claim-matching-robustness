That followed a decree issued last September not to extend the agreement.\n\nThe treaty, signed in 1997, obliged Russia and Ukraine to \"respect the territorial integrity of each other and confirm the inviolability of current mutual borders.\u201d\n\nThe accord will officially expire on March 31.\n\nMoscow\u2019s attempt to portray Ukrainian authorities as manufacturing Russian aggression in order to \u201cviolate the rights of their own citizens\u201d is disingenuous.\n\nRussia clearly violated the treaty with its invasion, occupation and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014, followed by its use of force to control parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian takeover of Crimea in February 2014 began when Russian special forces, operating without national insignia, seized the Crimean parliament building and raised the Russian flag.\n\nThe bloodless invasion by the \u201clittle green men\u201d resulted in Russia taking control of the peninsula.\n\nIgor \u201cStrelkov\u201d Girkin, a leading \u201cself-defense\u201d commander in Crimea and later commander of Russia-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukrainian, admitted in a 2015 interview that members of the Crimean parliament were herded into a chamber at gunpoint and forced to support the annexation.\n\nThe referendum in Crimea, hastily carried out under Russian military occupation, did not allow for public debate or for political leaders from greater Ukraine to visit the peninsula. And, in accordance with Ukraine\u2019s constitution, all Ukrainian citizens should have been allowed to vote in the referendum, not only residents of the peninsula.\n\nFurther undermining the referendum\u2019s validity were the two options on the ballot, each of which made it impossible for Crimea to maintain the status quo.\n\nOn March 27, the United Nation General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262, which stated that the referendum, \u201chaving no validity, cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol.\u201d The resolution urged all countries \u201cnot to recognize any alteration of the status\u201d of Crimea.\n\nApart from violating the Friendship Treaty, the Kremlin\u2019s annexation of Crimea also violated post-Soviet agreements Russia signed ensuring Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and borders, including the 1991 Belovezha Accords and the 1994 Budapest Memorandum.\n\nIn Eastern Ukraine, Polygraph.info reported there was overwhelming evidence of Moscow\u2019s involvement in the so-called \u201cseparatist\u201d war in the Donbas, launched after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nLeaders of the so-called \u201ccivil war\u201d were Russian citizens, the presence of Russian \u201cvolunteers\u201d in the country is well-documented and Russian military technology, never purchased by Ukraine, was found.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled that Moscow\u2019s actions in both Crimea and eastern Ukraine constitute an international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nAs Polygraph.info previously reported, the ICC used the word \u201ccrime\u201d to describe the conflict in 2016. The war in Donbas has claimed nearly 13,000 lives.\n\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister on European and Euroatlantic Integration, Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, recently said that Ukraine did not terminate the treaty earlier so that Kyiv could file suit against Russia on the \u201cbasis of the violations of the treaty committed by Russia.\u201d\n\n\"And this means that all these violations, such as the illegal annexation [of Crimea], and the invasion of eastern Ukraine, and this attack and aggression in the Black Sea-Azov region, in the Kerch Strait, all these things are documented and are grounds for us to sue the Russian Federation,\" the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN cites Klympush-Tsintsadze as saying.\n\nIn light of Russia\u2019s clear and repeated violations of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, Polygraph.info finds Moscow\u2019s claim that Kyiv is responsible for the breakdown of bilateral relations to be false.", "lang": "en"}
