In this case, a viral Facebook post dubiously attributes to the House speaker a quote suggesting President Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t be president because he\u2019s one of the \u201ccommon people.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is NOT a politician, properly vetted by the political arena and we do not accept common people in the reins of power,\u201d the post credits Pelosi with saying. \u201cCommon people are NOT allowed to be president and we DON\u2019T care who this shutdown hurts, we will show the American people who runs this country.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is no record of Pelosi ever making the comment. It appears nowhere on her verified social media accounts. Searching the congressional record and press releases also turned up no matches.
