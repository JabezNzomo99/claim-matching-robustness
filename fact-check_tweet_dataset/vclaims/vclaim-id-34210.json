The claim is misleading; the photos have circulated online since August, about three months before the bushfires broke out.\n\nThe photos were published in this tweet on November 13, 2019, alongside the following caption: \u201cThis is so wrong, some wanker in my area cut the heads off all the fire hoses during #NSWfires catastrophic fire season, wtf is wrong with people.. #nswrfs thank you for your service! I hope they catch the idiot!\u201d\n\nThe photos were shared in the same week that more than 100 bushfires scorched the states of New South Wales and Queensland on Australia\u2019s east coast during an unusually early fire season. The fires have killed at least four people and destroyed hundreds of homes, AFP reported here on November 14.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe photos were also published here, here and here on Twitter, and here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThey were published alongside other images in this Facebook post about severed fire hoses found in New South Wales in November.\n\nThe photos were shared in a misleading context; they show damaged hoses found at a fire station in Grose Vale, northwest of Sydney, in August -- about three months before damaging bushfires erupted on the east coast of Australia in November 2019.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the same photos published here on August 11 to the Facebook page of Grose Vale Rural Fire Brigade, a \u201cvolunteer organisation located in Bowen Mountain and Grose Vale NSW\u201d, according to its profile.\n\nThe post's caption states: \u201cWe're really disappointed to hear that firefighting hoses were vandalised at Grose Vale Rural Fire Brigade. Our volunteers need this crucial equipment to help protect the community.\u201d\n\nThe firefighters reposted the photos in this update issued on November 13, which states: \u201cDue to recent fire activity, this post from August 2019 has attracted a great deal of attention. Please be advised that this is an old post and the hoses have been repaired.\u201d\n\nIn response to a query about the photos in the misleading post, New South Wales Police on November 13 emailed a copy of a statement to AFP, which was originally issued in August about the Grose Vale incident.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cPolice are investigating following the damage of several hoses at the Grose Vale Rural Fire Brigade. It appears between 4pm 10/08/19 and 6.30am 11/08/19 five hoses were damaged while hanging out to dry.\n\n\u201cThe nozzle of each hose was cut. The incident was reported to Hawkesbury Police for investigation.\u201d\n\nThe Hawkesbury Gazette, a local newspaper, also published a report about the vandalism here on August 15.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:", "lang": "en"}
