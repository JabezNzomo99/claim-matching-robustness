So, without further ado, we are going to excerpt from that Aug. 28, 1992, article by the distinguished historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who passed away in 2007. The entire \u201cfacts\u201d section, except for the noncomment by Kasich\u2019s spokesman, is from Schlesinger\u2019s report, which was titled \u201cThe History of Those Words Lincoln Never Said.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they truly don\u2019t understand,\u201d Reagan said, \u201cis the principle so eloquently stated by Abraham Lincoln: \u2018You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage-earner by pulling down the wage-payer. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe author of the less than immortal words Lincoln never said was an ex-clergyman from Erie, Pa., named William J. H. Boetcker. Having abandoned the pulpit for a more lucrative career as a labor relations adviser for employers, Boetcker in 1916 produced a booklet under the title of \u201cInside Maxims, Gold Nuggets Taken From the Boetcker Lectures.\u201d\n\nAmong the nuggets was: \u201cWe cannot strengthen the weak/By weakening the strong./We cannot help the Poor/By kicking the Rich.\u201d The next year Boetcker expanded his list into \u201cThe Industrial Decalogue: Ten Don\u2019ts,\u201d from which Mr. Reagan in his genial way ascribes points 2, 4, 5 and 10 to Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe \u201cTen Points\u201d were invoked from time to time in the 1930s by anti-New Deal businessmen: Thus Investor America in February 1940 published them under the title \u201cWarning Signs on the Road to Prosperity.\u201d The American Federation of Investors subsequently reprinted the maxims on a leaflet, and they soon showed up in Republican orations, in business house organs and even on Christmas cards.\n\nIn 1942 the Committee for Constitutional Government, a right-wing organization headed by the publisher Frank Gannett, put out a leaflet titled \u201cLincoln on Limitation\u201d with authentic Lincoln quotations on the face and Boetcker\u2019s \u201cDecalogue\u201d on the reverse. Some printings attributed the \u201cTen Points\u201d to Boetcker; others did not, and careless readers assumed Lincoln\u2019s authorship. In 1943 the Royal Forum, a Paterson, N.J., house organ, explicitly ascribed \u201cTen Things You Cannot Do\u201d to Lincoln.\n\nSo the false attribution passed into circulation. On Nov. 30, 1949, in his weekly broadcast, the commentator Galen Drake assigned the quote to Lincoln. In January 1950 Rep. Frances Bolton of Ohio read them into the Congressional Record as Lincoln\u2019s maxims, and Look magazine, to the subsequent chagrin of its editor, Gardner Cowles, gave them a full-page spread.\n\nEver since, Lincoln scholars have been busy swatting the fake quotes down. Republican orators, however, remain suckers for the \u201cDecalogue.\u201d In the 1960s the Republican National Committee even warned its speakers, \u201cDo not use them as Lincoln\u2019s words!\u201d but to no avail.\n\nOn Sept. 19, 1988, George H. W. Bush said in a speech before the Bucks County Chamber of Commerce, \u201cYou can\u2019t strengthen the weak by weakening the strong; you can\u2019t help small men by tearing down big men; you can\u2019t help the poor by destroying the rich; you can\u2019t lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.\u201d\n\nSo now Ronald Reagan\u2026gives this spurious Lincolniana new currency. But one must wonder how anyone who affects to admire Lincoln can possibly suppose that the most fastidious and felicitous writer ever to be president could have produced such tinny banalities. However Lincoln sounded, he never sounded like a tout for the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nClearly, this is worthy of Four Pinocchios. The only saving grace for Kasich is that he finds himself in good company. (President Obama also once earned Four Pinocchios for repeating a tall tale attributed to Reagan.)\n\nBut if Kasich is going to run for president, he probably should improve his staff work. A quick perusal of the Internet would have easily turned up evidence that these quotes are phony (though, as Schlesinger noted, it is a mystery why would anyone think Lincoln would utter such banalities). We especially liked a blog post with this amusing photograph:", "lang": "en"}
