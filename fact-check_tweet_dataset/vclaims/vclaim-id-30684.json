The caption when translated in English, \"Kejri taking blessings from Imran Khan ahead of Delhi elections.\" (Original text in Hindi: \"\u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u091a\u0941\u0928\u093e\u0935 \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0947 \u0907\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0936\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926 \u0932\u0947\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u0915\u0947\u091c\u0930\u0940\u0964\")\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one such post.\n\nAnother post speculates the reason why Kejriwal had to team up with Khan to win the election.

A Fact-Check Upon relevant keyword searches, BOOM found that Imran Khan had met Kejriwal in May, 2016, during his visit to Delhi. The two met at Kejriwal's residence in Flagstaff Road in the capital and had tweeted about the same.\n\nAn extended clip of their meeting can be seen below, which was uploaded by the Delhi Government's YouTube channel. Khan however has not met Kejriwal in the recent times.\n\nIn fact Kejriwal recently took on Pakistan's federal minister of science and technology, Ch Fawad Hussain who called on people to defeat the BJP in the Delhi elections. Kejriwal said that a Pakistan minister should not \"meddle with India's internal matters.\"\n\nThe photos had resurfaced in 2018, when The Quint debunked them. Read the fact-check here. A screenshot of a tweet by an unverified handle of Hamid Gul, former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) DG of Pakistan Army has been used in Facebook posts to claim that Pakistan has urged Indian netizens to vote for AAP. BOOM found that the tweet was shared by the handle @GenHameedGul in May, 2015. Gul died in August, 2015. The account appears to be fake as tweets were shared even in December that year.", "lang": "en"}
