The right sidebar has a title \u201c\u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0913 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f (Only for women)\u201d and has 5 big squares with some more intense porn action. In the main body of the post, there\u2019s a title section and thereafter a body section. At the end of this, there are 15 medium sized squares spread over 5 rows with 15 more GIFs of animated porn action. The sub-heading of the website describes the site as follows: \u201cHindi News, Taja Khabar, Latest News, Breaking News, Hindi Samachar, India News\u201d.\n\nThere are Modi supporters who actually believe that a piece of writing embedded between 21 squares of intense porn action can actually be real news. Not only do they believe that it is real news, they are also extremely enraged at CPI-ML leader Kavita Krishnan who in one of the articles on this website has been accused of calling PM Modi impotent and stating that she wants \u2018free sex\u2019 for women \u2013 \u201c\u0915\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0928 \u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0940\u090f\u092e \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u092c\u0924\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0928\u092a\u0941\u0902\u0938\u0915, \u0930\u0916\u0940 \u092b\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0938 \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0902\u0917\u201d.\n\nIn the article, it is alleged that while addressing an Adivasi women\u2019s meeting in Bastar, Chhattisgarh, she said that women should have the freedom to have sex with anybody. It is also claimed in the article that she accused Mr Modi of pushing Adivasis to starvation because of demonetisation while letting the rich defaultors get away scott-free. If is further claimed in the article that she called Mr Modi impotent on the pretext that Mr Modi abandoned his wife and if he can do so, how can he be trusted with the country?\n\nWhile the new screams \u201cFAKE\u201d in your face, we still decided to cross verify it with Kavita Krishnan. When we spoke to her over a phone call, she stated that she\u2019s never addressed any meeting in Bastar ever and the only time she went there was as part of a fact-finding team. When we asked her for her views about the fake propaganda that is going on against her, she stated:\n\nThis kind of news not only amounts to sexual harassment, it endangers me, as a woman, and exposes me to more sexual harassment and violence because it paints me as an immoral and sexually loose woman. Even if I do not share these notions of patriarchal morality, the fact remains that criminals feel they have a license to sexually assault or abuse women who are perceived as \u2018immoral\u2019.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Kavita also stated that she\u2019s planning legal action against all the sites/portals which carried this news.\n\nAfter speaking to Kavita, we dug in further to find the source of this news. By this time, the same piece of text, without a single word changed in the body of the text, but varying titles had already been posted to 15-20 sites and was shared thousands of time on social media. Here\u2019s a sample.\n\nWhich one of them was the culprit who initiated this chain reaction? Via Facebook Search, we found out that a post by Kumar Sanu Bhardwaj on a Facebook group called \u2018Rohit Sardana and Sudhir Chaudhary Fan Club\u2019 at 2:54 pm on April 5th was the first public post regarding this issue and the article was from a site called chakravyuhindia.in.\n\nMost of the websites that are shown in the screenshots above run because they post such fake news with click-bait headlines and they earn money from the advertisement clicks that follow. If one \u2018news item\u2019 goes viral, irrespective of the authenticity, the article is copied over verbatim to multiple sites hoping for some advertisement clicks on their websites too.\n\nRecently, we showed how one Nita Pandey who has been accused of corruption was passed off as NDTV India journalist Ravish Kumar\u2019s sister. We also showed how a website called newspur.in wrote about a non-existent fatwa against Zee Anchor Rohit Sardana and the issue trended the entire day on Twitter. Just like in the present case, newspur.in also runs purely because of advertisement clicks. Thus the fake news industry rolls on while the management of Facebook, Twitter, Google etc refuse to take action against such sites, thus endangering the lives and credibility of individuals who are being targeted by these fake news sites.", "lang": "en"}
