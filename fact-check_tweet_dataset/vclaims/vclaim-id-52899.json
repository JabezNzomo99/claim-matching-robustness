The screenshot of the tweet, which has been falsely linked to Shah, reads, \"I am sorry to hear about the passing of #SushantSinghRajput. A young & talented Cricketer gone too soon. My condolences to his family, friends & fans across the world.\" Rajput played former Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in his biopic, MS Dhoni: The Untold Story.\n\nBOOM found that the viral screenshot purporting to be Amit Shah's tweet is morphed and Shah did not misidentify the late actor as a cricketer. A similar fake tweet was attributed to Rahul Gandhi earlier. We checked Gandhi's Twitter timeline and found that he had correctly addressed Rajput as an 'actor' and not a 'cricketer' in his condolence tweet. The original tweet matches the date and time - 7.31 pm on June 14, 2020, as in the viral screenshot, and the text is also the same except for the word 'cricketer'. Amit Shah's condolence tweet on the actor can be seen here.", "lang": "en"}
