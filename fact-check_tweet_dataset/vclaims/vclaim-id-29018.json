He, however, did not provide any statistics about the state\u2019s debt profile.\n\nA check on the websites of the Debt Management Office (DMO), the official institution that coordinates the management of Nigeria\u2019s entire debt, and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the agency that provides official statistics on all the Mi nistries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in Nigeria, reveals that as at Decemb er 31, 2018, Gombe State\u2019s domestic debt was N63,337,930, 142.60 (N63 billion); while the external debt was $37,406.069. 57 ($37 million), which translates to N11,483,575,432. 00 (N11 billion).\n\n[To get the naira value of the external debt, Gombe state\u2019s external debt was multip lied by N307, the official exchange rate of a dollar to naira as at December 31, 2018.]\n\nIf the domestic debt of N63 billion is added to the external debt of N11billion, the result is N74,821,687, 574.60 (N74 billion); a figure which is less than the N110 billion the transitio n committee claimed is Gombe State\u2019s debt. This therefore means that the claim that Gombe State debt is N110 billion as at December 31, 2018 is FALSE.\n\nWhen the Secretary of the Tr ansition Committee, Zubairu Umar was contacted to provide co ncrete evidence about how they arrived at the state\u2019s debt, he said the committee relied on undisclosed \u201csources\u201d, and will provide us with more information in due course. [We are yet to receive further information].\n\nOUR CONCLUSION? The claim is FALSE!\n\nGbenga Samuel Salau is a graduate of Communication and Language Arts, University of Ibadan.
