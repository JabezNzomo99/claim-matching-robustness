Instead, we came across references to that quote dating back years, well before the 29-year-old political newcomer entered the public eye.\n\nAt a 2013 Liberty Fund event, for example, the economist Russell Roberts of Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution cited it in jest.\n\n\u201cMy view of capitalism has always been that under capitalism, man oppresses man. But under socialism, it\u2019s the other way around,\u201d he said to laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s not my line. I\u2019m told it came from MAD Magazine. And to be honest, it\u2019s not my view\u2014but it does capture the reality that all political and economic systems are imperfect.\u201d\n\nOthers have traced it, or some iteration of it, back to the late economist John Kenneth Galbraith.\n\nAnother remark often attributed to Galbraith is, \u201cUnder capitalism, man exploits man. Under communism, it\u2019s just the opposite.\u201d If he didn\u2019t say it, he might as well have. It has an authentically Galbraithian ring: It seems profound, and it\u2019s funny. But it encapsulates perhaps the worst error that a student of economy and society could have made in the past century\u2014the idea that, under the surface, those two systems are pretty much alike, not least ethically. The common man has no standing, no real power, in either case. The main difference resides in which small group of people is actually in charge. That is something that Galbraith certainly appeared to believe. It is a main theme of his writings. And it is a travesty of the truth.\n\nAppearing on Twitter in recent weeks, as well, the misattributed quote has been shared thousands of times across social media. Nugent\u2019s Facebook post of the meme alone garnered nearly 15,000 shares.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
