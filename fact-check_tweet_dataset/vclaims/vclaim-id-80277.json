The person in the image is actually a provincial governor.\n\nThe misleading post -- which has been shared some 1,900 times with 2,100 reactions -- was first shared to Facebook on September 6, 2018, with a caption that says: \u201cThis is the real leader of the people\u201d.\n\nThe post contains a screenshot from what appears to be a Whatsapp group chat. It includes a photo of a man resting on a stretcher beneath a pink sleeping bag.\n\nThe accompanying text says: \u201cThis is President Jokowi sleeping at an evacuation camp in Lombok. I\u2019m very proud to have a leader like this.\u201d\n\nThe man in the photo is actually Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo, the governor\u2019s spokesman Lilik Henry Ristanto told AFP.\n\nLilik said the photo was taken on September 2 when Pranowo was volunteering at an evacuation camp in northern Lombok, one of areas hardest hit by the quakes.\n\nEarthquakes and aftershocks since July have killed about 550 people on Lombok and forced hundreds of thousands into evacuation shelters or tents.\n\nThe image was posted to Pranowo\u2019s official Instagram account @ganjar_pranowo on September 3, with a caption saying: \u201cSleeping! After wandering around Lombok for a day\u2026 Thank God for your blessings.\u201d\n\nThe photo also appeared in an article by major Indonesian news website Tribunnews on September 3 about Pranowo cutting short his Lombok trip to attend his swearing-in ceremony in Jakarta.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s presidential press secretary Bey Machmudin told AFP the person in the picture was not Widodo.\n\nWidodo was in Lombok on September 2 and Machmudin said he had slept in a camp for people displaced by the earthquake.\n\n\u201cHe did indeed sleep in a tent but the pictures circulating online are most likely not of him because we don't expose him while sleeping,\"\n\n\"There were no photographers when he slept in the tent and we don't take pictures of him while sleeping,\" he added.", "lang": "en"}
