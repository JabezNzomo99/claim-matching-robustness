At the start of the year, following the death of Biden\u2019s son to brain cancer, the vice president took the lead in the administration\u2019s Cancer Moonshot project, an effort to rapidly accelerate cancer research.\n\nRuto cast cancer as a top public health priority for his country.\n\n\"Cancer and matters to do with kidney failure kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined,\" Ruto said Sept. 9, 2016.\n\nGiven that AIDS is the No. 1 killer in sub-Saharan Africa, and malaria ranks fourth, our Africa Check partners decided to check Ruto\u2019s numbers. He is wrong.\n\nFor the record, Ruto\u2019s office did not provide any supporting data.\n\nSolid data is sorely lacking in Kenya as it is in most sub-Saharan African nations. But the numbers that are available disprove Ruto\u2019s claim.\n\nKenya just launched a national cancer registry, but it won\u2019t be fully in place until 2019. For the time being, the highest estimate puts the number of cancer deaths at 28,000 in 2015.\n\nOn kidney disease, Kenya has no national data at all. The World Health Organization estimates 3,100 deaths for 2014.\n\nWHO is the most reliable source for tuberculosis death estimates in Kenya as well, with about 9,400 deaths in 2014.\n\nThe United Nations AIDS program relies on statistical models to derive the number of AIDS deaths in Kenya. UNAIDS says it is \"logistically impossible and ethically problematic\" to investigate all deaths. According to its statistical model, there were between 28,000 and 50,000 deaths due to AIDS in Kenya in 2014, with 38,000 being the most likely figure.\n\nFor malaria, the WHO said in its World Malaria Report for 2015 that it was unable to collect data for six East African countries, including Kenya, between 2000 and 2014 because of \"inconsistent reporting, or changes in health service accessibility or diagnostic testing\".\n\nThe best we could find for malaria deaths was Kenya\u2019s civil registration data, which provisionally shows 23,789 deaths in 2013 and 20,691in 2015.\n\nAs you can see, while the numbers are far from perfect, they do not support Ruto\u2019s point.\n\nThis table pulls the numbers together. Even using the lowest estimates for AIDS and malaria deaths, the combined toll is greater than for cancer and kidney disease.\n\nThere are efforts such as the Health Data Collaborative and the African Health Initiative that aim to beef up the health data collected in sub-Saharan Africa. But it will be a tough slog.\n\nRobert Black at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health helps oversee the data coordination program at the African Health Initiative and he told us it will take many years before these countries have robust systems.\n\n\"The funding that is available for this from both national and donor funds is grossly inadequate to reach that objective in the near term,\" Black said.\n\nIn May 2016, Kenya became the first African country to launch a national effort to ramp up its systems for collecting health data. One of the top priorities? Making sure that every death and cause of death is recorded.\n\nRuto said that cancer and kidney disease \"kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined.\" The precision of the numbers leaves a lot to be desired, but based on the best estimates, Ruto isn\u2019t even close. Using conservative estimates, deaths from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are double those from cancer and kidney disease.", "lang": "en"}
