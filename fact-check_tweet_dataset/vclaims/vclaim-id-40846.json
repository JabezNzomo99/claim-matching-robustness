We found no record of WHO objecting to the American policy specifically.\n\nOn Jan. 30, WHO declared that COVID-19 had reached the highest level of alert, a Public Health Emergency Of International Concern. It said \"all countries should be prepared for containment\" and urged them to launch testing and tracing programs.\n\nIn its statement, WHO said it \"does not recommend any travel or trade restriction.\" But it also acknowledged that countries could impose limits, saying, \"Countries must inform WHO about travel measures taken, as required by the International Health Regulations.\"\n\nThose regulations, first drafted in 2005 after China hid the SARS epidemic from the world, spell out what each country and bodies like WHO must do in the face of a new infectious disease. The document says that countries need to explain why a travel ban is warranted.\n\nThe United States had company in banning entry from China. Singapore moved on Jan. 29, Italy suspended all flights Jan. 31, and Australia imposed a ban on Feb.1, to mention just a few of the more than 40 nations that acted at about the same time.\n\nAs late as Feb. 29, WHO was not recommending travel restrictions. It said that \"restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations.\"\n\nEric Goosby, professor health at the University of California San Francisco and former U.S. global AIDS coordinator, said the research backs up WHO\u2019s policy. There\u2019s no proof that closing borders works against viruses. Worse, he said, they can be counterproductive.\n\n\"There\u2019s a risk with travel bans of domino effects that don\u2019t help fight the outbreak,\" Goosby said. \"And other steps, like testing, do more to help countries respond and contain an infectious disease.\"\n\nHealth experts say Trump is wrong about early, credible evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"There were questions, but no solid confirmation,\" Boston University global health researcher Davidson Hamer said. \"It wasn\u2019t until mid January that reasonable evidence began to come out.\"\n\nSo, Trump is right when he points to mid January as the pivot point, but he\u2019s off the mark about the quality of the information earlier.\n\nOn Jan. 12, WHO said that \"there is no clear evidence that the virus passes easily from person to person.\"\n\nOn Jan. 14, WHO\u2019s lead investigator Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters that \"it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission.\"\n\nVan Kerkhove however warned that a wider outbreak was possible and that WHO had told hospitals around the world to take steps to prevent spreading the infection.\n\nWe asked the White House and the Trump campaign to explain the basis for the claim about evidence from December. We did not hear back.\n\nThe closest match we found were reports about a doctor in Wuhan who warned his colleagues in a chat group about a disease that looked like SARS on Dec. 30. Local officials muzzled the doctor, who later died from COVID-19.\n\n\"We now have good evidence that Chinese authorities knew about the spread and were hiding it at this time,\" said Ashish K. Jha, Director, Harvard Global Health Institute. \"Whistleblowers and \u2018rumor mongers\u2019 among healthcare professionals were silenced. But it\u2019s unclear how much the WHO could have possibly known about that at the time.\"\n\nHamer said that he might have been too trusting of what China was reporting, perhaps because the government was much more transparent than it had been in 2002 with the SARS pandemic.\n\nHe was hearing from his global health colleagues at the time that \"this was the real deal.\" Hamer thinks WHO could have been faster.\n\n\"They took a little too long to declare this a major emergency,\" Hamer said. \"They waited a week to 10 days to come out and say this thing was moving quickly and was a global health concern.\"\n\nThis overstates WHO\u2019s ability to get a team into China, and exaggerates the impact WHO could have had if it arrived sooner.\n\nBy Jan. 12, China had shared the genetic sequence of the virus, but it delayed on accepting a mission of infectious disease specialists from WHO.\n\nAt the end of January, China agreed to work with a WHO group of doctors and epidemiologists. The group didn\u2019t arrive until mid February. The international regulations give each country full control over such visits.\n\n\"WHO has no additional authority they could have exercised,\" Jha said. \"As an organization made up of member states, they can only provide guidance, aid, and coordination, but not force member states to do anything.\"\n\nRELATED: What\u2019s true, what\u2019s not in Biden\u2019s attacks on Trump and getting experts in China amid coronavirus\n\nAccording to every expert we spoke to, the presumption that a WHO team would have had a major impact is suspect.\n\n\"The rules of engagement were unclear,\" Georgetown Law School professor Lawrence Gostin said. \"Could, for example, WHO have independent access to data, talk with scientists and doctors freely? It was never likely WHO would have significant access to China to work as genuine partners.\"", "lang": "en"}
