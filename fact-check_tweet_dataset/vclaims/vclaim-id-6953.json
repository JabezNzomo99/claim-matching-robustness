(We contacted the War Studies department at King\u2019s College in England seeking comment on those stories, but have yet to hear back.)\n\nMore recently, a 2002 column published in the Sri Lankan Sunday Observer calling coconut water \u201cthe fluid of life\u201d stated that it could be used as a stand-in for blood plasma \u201cbecause it is sterile, pyrogen-free and does not produce heat, and does not destroy blood cells.\u201d Health-related web sites like Body Ecology and Listverse have made similar claims. As the latter blog reported in December 2017:\n\nCoconut water can be used (in emergencies) as a substitute for blood plasma.The reason for this is that coconut water (the water found in coconuts \u2013 not to be confused with coconut milk, which comes from the flesh of the coconut) is sterile and has an ideal pH level. Coconut water is liquid endosperm \u2013 it surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition.\n\nThe claim also surfaced in a humorous post about \u201cvegan vampires\u201d circulating online:\n\nSo I learned from my friend that coconut water can be used as an emergency blood transfusion, and of course my first thought was \u201cSo, can a vampire drink coconut water?\u201d And of course we had this idea of these tropical vampires being horrified when these old world vampires come and are still drinking blood like some sort of monster.\n\nBut according to George Yaghmour, a licensed doctor and an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine, the consequences of using coconut water as a plasma \u201csubstitute\u201d are not funny at all; he told us:\n\nCoconut water and plasma are not equal fluids. Since 1942, there have been several studies confirming that coconut water mimicked intracellular fluids, not the extracellular plasma. While coconut water is a good source for calcium, potassium and magnesium as an oral hydration source, these same elements are concerning when it comes to intravenous use of coconut water, particularly when given in fluid boluses. Hypotonic fluids like coconut water could cause cerebral edema, blood hemolysis, worsening kidney failure, heart arrhythmia and many other neurological complications. There may also be irritation at the injection site.\n\nYaghmour also told us that during \u201cperiods of crisis,\u201d such as major conflicts or epidemics, coconut water may have served as an alternative for medical personnel to buy time for treatment. But \u201cthe acidity, hypotonicity, and high potassium do not make coconut water the ideal resuscitation solution.\u2019\n\nTo date, we have also been unable to confirm the existence of vampires \u2014 vegan, tropical, or otherwise.", "lang": "en"}
