A photo is going viral on social media in which a person can be seen bowing down in front of a Buddhist monk.

In fact, the second person seen in the photo stated that the age of the Buddhist monk is 114 years, not 144. The age of the Buddhist monk is not confirmed by Team Vishvas, but the person present with the monk in the photo confirmed it to us.\n\nIn the viral post, a person can be seen sitting in front of a Buddhist monk with his head down and hand folded. The post\u2019s caption reads: \u201c144 years old Buddhist monk.\u201d\n\nTo start our investigation, we took a screenshot of this viral photo and searched it on Google reverse image. In this search, we found that this picture was originally uploaded on social media website Instagram on 23rd June 2019 from an account named magie.du.bouddha. The post\u2019s description was written in French which translates to English as \u201c I had a meeting with the very venerable lp Saur Kantiko (114 years). This masters shows the real meaning of kindness and spirituality. I was really lucky that I was able to meet him at his temple. \u201dAccording to this post, he is 114 years old.\n\nAfter this we found the official website of magie du bouddha. According to magie.du.bouddha\u2019s website, the man who bowed down in front of the monk is a webmaster who collects and sells Buddhist amulets and items on his website.\n\nWe talked to Jerome, founder of the magie du bouddha website, for confirmation. Who told us, \u201cAt first I am not at all happy that my photo is\u201d going viral \u201cin India or anywhere. People are using this photo without my consent, which is wrong. This monk is actually 114 years old. He live in the Sisket region of Thailand. His name is LP Solar Kantikko and he is a monk in Wat Pho Si Temple. \u201d\n\nAfter this, we wanted to know who is the most aged person alive.
