The same video was also shared thousands of times in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French with the claim that it showed a demonstration in Colombia. Both claims are false. The video was recorded during a protest in Venezuela on January 23, 2019 when opposition leader Juan Guaido proclaimed himself interim president of the country.\n\nOn November 16, 2019 Republican senator and former US presidential candidate Marco Rubio tweeted a link to an Associated Press story which said Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido led a peaceful protest of thousands. Rubio said the report claimed the demonstration turnout wasn\u2019t large and tried to contradict it by adding a video with the statement: \u201cMaybe I am missing something but the videos I am getting look pretty impressive to me.\u201d Rubio represents the US state of Florida, home to a large Venezuelan community.\n\nThe exact same video was also shared thousands of times on Twitter on November 21, 2019 with the claim, \u201cSomething is sweeping South America, and the world. This is Colombia protesting their far-right government today.\u201d The English language post has since been deleted, but AFP archived it here.\n\nThe video caption was linked to the demonstrations on November 21 against the government of Colombian President Ivan Duque.\n\nIt was shared in Spanish (1,2), including by Manuel D\u2019Avila, a candidate in the 2018 presidential elections in Brazil, as well as in Portuguese and French.\n\nA key detail of the video indicates clearly that the images were not filmed in Colombia: the crowd is singing a passage from the Venezuelan national anthem.\n\nAs recognized by an AFP journalist, the crowd is chanting this passage from Venezuela\u2019s national anthem: \u201cA este santo nombre / tembl\u00f3 de pavor/ el vil ego\u00edsmo / que una vez m\u00e1s triunf\u00f3\u201d. (\u201cUpon this holy name / Trembled in great dread / The vile selfishness / That has once prevailed.\u201d)\n\nUsing a keyword search and a reverse image search, the AFP Factual team found the same video posted on YouTube on February 4, 2019. A tip from a reader also pointed to this version of the video posted on YouTube on January 23, 2019. According to both publications, the images were recorded on Cedeno Avenue, in the city of Valencia, in the Venezuelan state of Carabobo on January 23, 2019.\n\nA Twitter search from that date finds the same video shared several times (1, 2).\n\nOn that day, then-leader of the Venezuelan parliament Juan Guaido proclaimed himself interim president, which triggered major demonstrations throughout the country, including on Cedeno Avenue in Valencia. According to local media,(1,2,3), protesters took to the streets against President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe demonstration was also captured in other videos posted on Twitter (1, 2, 3) in January.\n\nAn analysis of the images of Cedeno Avenue available on Google Maps allows for the confirmation of the location in the video. Two of the buildings seen in the recording are visible on Google Maps,, as shown below.\n\nIn addition, protesters raise a flag with three bands of the same width -- one red, one blue and one yellow, like the flag of Venezuela. The Colombian flag, by contrast, has a larger yellow band than the other two colors.\n\nThe November 21 protests in Colombia were captured on video by AFP. Here is an AFP story about the protest.\n\nAFP photographers were also present at both opposition and pro-government demonstrations in Venezuela on November 16. This AFP report from the day estimated that about 5,000 people joined Guaido for a rally in Caracas while hundreds of Chavistas mobilized in support of Maduro.\n\nDespite multiple people commenting on Rubio\u2019s tweet that the video did not show a November 2019 protest in Venezuela, his tweet remained on his personal account, which has four million followers, as of November 26, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
