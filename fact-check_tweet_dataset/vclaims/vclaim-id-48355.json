It bore the headline, \u201cPhilippines Bracing for Direct Hit From Massive Typhoon.\u201d\n\nThe news report is over four years old, published on Oct. 16, 2015 by the National Broadcasting Company. Koppu, the name of the typhoon, as seen on the report\u2019s thumbnail, was locally called Lando and made landfall that Oct. 14. It left 58 people dead and over P14.3 billion in damages to agriculture and infrastructure in Luzon.\n\nSeveral public Facebook (FB) groups and pages began resurfacing the old story on April 15, even as the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reported that day that there is \u201cno low pressure area or storm within the Philippine Area of Responsibility.\u201d\n\n\n\nTraffic to the story largely came from the following social media accounts that dubiously revived the NBC report: FB groups SWERTRES HEARING - SMALL TOWN LOTTERY - LOTTO RESULTS and BANGSAMORO NEWS, and FB page I LOVE BENGUET.\n\nReaching over 1,000 interactions collectively, the revived posts were met with mixed reactions from netizens, some calling it out as misleading while others expressing worry and invoking prayers.", "lang": "en"}
