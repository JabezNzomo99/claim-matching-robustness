Such emergency declarations bolster state or local \u201cefforts in providing emergency services, such as the protection of lives, property, public health, and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States,\u201d the Federal Emergency Management Agency notes.\n\n\n\nThe federal government\u2019s response included measures such as distributing water and providing water filters and water sampling. The emergency declaration ended in August 2016.\n\nAccording to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, \u201c[s]ince July 2016, the city of Flint\u2019s water system has tested below action levels of the federal Lead and Copper Rule (LCR).\u201d In early 2018, the state declared the water quality \u201crestored\u201d after repeated tests showed that 90 percent of samples from \u201chigher risk\u201d locations were below half the federal threshold of 15 parts per billion (ppb) for the Lead and Copper Rule.\n\nObama also signed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act in December 2016. The act provided $170 million for communities grappling with drinking water emergencies and Flint was specifically mentioned as an intended recipient. The Environmental Protection Agency officially awarded Flint $100 million of the WIIN-authorized funding in March 2017, then under the Trump administration, to help fund water infrastructure replacements and upgrades.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the federal government\u2019s response was without criticism. The EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General, for example, said in a 2018 report that the agency\u2019s response was \u201cdelayed, in part, because the EPA did not establish clear roles and responsibilities, risk assessment procedures, effective communication and proactive oversight tools.\u201d It cited \u201cimplementation and oversight lapses\u201d at the local, state and federal levels.\n\nWork remains ongoing to replace lead and galvanized steel pipes throughout Flint, and distribution of donated bottled water has continued in the meantime. Even so, to say \u201cObama declared Flint water crisis a National Emergency and never fixed it\u201d is misleading in several respects.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cEPA Awards $100 Million to Michigan for Flint Water Infrastructure Upgrades.\u201d Press release, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 17 Mar 2017.\n\n\u201cFederal Response by the Numbers \u2013 Flint, Michigan.\u201d Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
