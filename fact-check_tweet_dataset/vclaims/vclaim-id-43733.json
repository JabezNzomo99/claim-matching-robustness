But at one point on the Iowa debate stage, there was also talk of losing \u2014 and losing and losing.\n\nIt came up during a back-and-forth between Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., over the question of whether Sanders had once told her that a woman cannot win the presidency.\n\nDuring the debate, Warren said, \"I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record. So, can a woman beat Donald Trump? Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women, Amy and me.\" Warren was referring to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.\n\nReaders asked us to track down the math behind this assertion. We found that Warren\u2019s count was correct.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the electoral win-loss records of the six candidates on stage during the CNN-Des Moines Register debate on Jan. 14. The 10 losses are listed in boldface.\n\n1972 Lost U.S. Senate special election (running on the Liberty Union party line)\n\n1972 Lost election for Vermont governor (running on the Liberty Union party line)\n\n1986 Lost election for Vermont governor (running as an independent)\n\nThis is Steyer\u2019s first race for public office.\n\nMeanwhile, after this exchange, Warren and Sanders faced off on another piece of their electoral win-loss records.\n\nWarren said that she was \"the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican any time in the past 30 years.\"\n\nThe two candidates sparred over the meaning of \"at any time in the past 30 years.\"\n\nAs the list above shows, Sanders defeated an incumbent Republican in 1990. That\u2019s right on Warren\u2019s cutoff of 30 years.\n\nWarren said, \"Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women, Amy and me.\"\n\nWe checked the electoral histories of the candidates on stage and found that Warren spoke accurately. We rate her statement True.", "lang": "en"}
