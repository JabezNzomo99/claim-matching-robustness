{"title": "Historically high levels of tax?", "subtitle": "In recent years the UK's tax take has varied between 30% and 35% of GDP.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-18618", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/are-we-collecting-historically-high-levels-tax/", "vclaim": "\u201cwe are already taxed to broadly the historic limit of taxation in the economy. If you look at figures going back to the 1970s, the tax take to GDP varies between 34% and 38%. If you look at the Treasury red book we are heading towards the 38% level.\u201d\n\nThe story Mr Rees-Mogg is telling seems to refer only to government income from taxes, although the figures he\u2019s using seem to be for all government income, which includes things like profits from government-owned companies, or the sale of government assets. We're trying to get in touch with his office.\n\nIf he\u2019s referring to all government income, he\u2019s right to say the government\u2019s income is about 36% of GDP\u2014roughly \u00a3680 billion\u2014which is forecast to rise to about 38% by the end of the decade.\n\nAnd it\u2019s true that the government\u2019s total income has varied around 36-38% of GDP in recent years.\n\n\n\nHowever, if we look back as far as the 1970s, as he suggests, the variation is much larger. There have been points where government income as a proportion of GDP has been higher than 40%.\n\n38% government income as a proportion of GDP would be the highest since the 1980s, but not an unprecedented proportion. The government took in receipts worth over 40% of the economy at points in the 60s, 70s and 80s, and was at its peak in the post-war years in the 1940s.\n\nThat said, if we just look at taxes, current tax receipts as a proportion of GDP do seem to be close to their historic high-point.\n\nA reader got in touch to point out that Mr Rees-Moggs use of the word \u201climit\u201d was contentious, since it implied that it would not be possible for a government to tax any more than that. This is a fair point. In our factcheck, we interpreted \u201climit\u201d to mean the \u201cupper limit\u201d of previous taxation levels, not the highest level of tax that\u2019s possible.", "lang": "en"}
