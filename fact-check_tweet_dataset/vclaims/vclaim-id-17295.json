It looked at survey data from the Office for National Statistics and found that middle-earning women born between 1981 and 2000 earned around 5% per hour less than their male counterparts, a smaller gap than in previous generations.\n\nIn other words, if you knew absolutely nothing else about two workers in the UK, aside from the fact that one was a woman, one was a man, and both were in their twenties, on average you would expect the woman to earn roughly 5% less per hour than the man.\n\nThe claim also happens to be justified if you look at the middle-earning woman each week aged 22-29. She earned around 6% less each week than the middle-earning man last year.\n\nGender pay gap stats are useful, but have their limitations\n\nAlthough there is a gap between the pay of men and women, it\u2019s harder to say what the statistic tells us.\n\nAs the Resolution Foundation pointed out, its measure of the \u2018gender pay gap\u2019 isn\u2019t comparing like-with-like. It\u2019s comparing median average earnings in the whole group of women who work, against the whole group of men who work.\n\nThat\u2019s a bit different from what people often think of as the \u2018gender pay gap\u2019: the idea that a woman will be paid less than a man for doing exactly the same job.\n\nFor one reason or another, men and women in the UK tend towards different kinds of jobs, tend to work different hours, and arguably develop different skills and experience.\n\nSo there are a range of additional reasons why the gender pay gap might exist, alongside the possibility of outright discrimination.\n\nAlthough gendered wage inequalities suggest a lot about the way we organise and value different kinds of work across society as a whole, and particularly how these kinds of social pressures and choices are gendered, they aren\u2019t a direct measure of discrimination in the workplace.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more than one reasonable way to measure them. The ONS suggests looking at full-time workers alone is a good headline measure. But the Resolution Foundation told us that it chose to include part-time workers this time, since it thinks the gap in hourly pay between full-time and part-time work is an important issue.\n\nAs the ONS has put it:\n\nDifferent measures of the gender pay gap will capture different aspects of how the UK labour market is shaped by gender.\n\nMany people cite motherhood as one key reason for the gap\n\nOn the one hand, there\u2019s evidence that the gender pay gap increases later in life, partly as women become mothers.\n\nA recent report by the IFS think tank chose a third measure of the gap to both the Resolution Foundation and the ONS, which helped illustrate a different point: it showed that although a gap in mean average pay for men and women exists before people become parents, the gap increases steadily and substantially for 12 years after the birth of their first child.\n\nThe IFS\u2019 main interpretation is that mothers who choose to take time out of work miss out on workplace skills and experience, and so lose the opportunity for career progression.\n\nAs with other statistics on gendered pay inequalities, there\u2019s room for a range of interpretations.\n\nOn the other hand, we haven\u2019t seen clear evidence yet that the same women are getting ahead of men in terms of pay before they have children. The IFS found that over a third of the eventual difference in average wages between mothers and fathers existed before the first child was born.\n\nJill Kirby pointed us to a Guardian article from 2015, which was based on data collected by the Press Association. This suggested that women in their twenties were earning more than men. It\u2019s not clear exactly how these figures were put together, or whether the analysis is still up-to-date, so we\u2019ve asked the Press Association for the original release.\n\nBack in 2015, it was true that women aged 22-29 working full-time earned more each hour than their male counterparts. That was no longer the case in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
