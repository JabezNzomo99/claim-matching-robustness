{"title": "Does re-offending cost \u00a313 billion a year?", "subtitle": "That's the upper range of an estimate for 2007/08.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-3933", "url": "https://fullfact.org/crime/does-reoffending-cost-13-billion-year/", "vclaim": "This figure comes from a National Audit Office (NAO) study in 2010. Back then the NAO estimated re-offending by recent ex-prisoners cost the economy between \u00a39.5 and \u00a313 billion in 2007/08.\n\nThis is a hugely uncertain figure. Versions of it date back to estimates by the Home Office in 2000 who called the practice of estimating the cost of crime \u201cinevitably imprecise\u201d. They suggested the cost of crime to society in England and Wales was around \u00a360 billion, and it was later estimated 18% of this was because of re-offending by recent prisoners. That gave birth to the figures which have since been built upon to reach the figures we hear today.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to see why it\u2019s uncertain either. As the original researchers admit, it\u2019s not at all easy to work out how much a crime costs society as a whole, and how you\u2019d compare the costs of murder to wounding, or theft, or burglary. Even then, we don\u2019t even have precise estimates of what crimes are even happening.\n\nSo we can\u2019t place much confidence, at this stage, in a figure so old and uncertain.", "lang": "en"}
