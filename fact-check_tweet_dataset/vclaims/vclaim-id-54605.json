An image shared on Facebook claims Perry, an American singer-songwriter, spoke positively about cannibalism during an interview with a French radio station.\n\nThe image appears to be a screen grab from a news article that quotes Perry as saying cannibalism is \u201cway more popular than you might think\u201d and has \u201cgotten a bad rap\u201d from \u201csqueamish Christians and their hypocritical virtues and morals.\u201d The screen grab of the article also references Perry\u2019s 2017 song \u201cBon Appetit,\u201d which features Perry being prepared and cooked by chefs in the music video.\n\nBut the quotes from Perry seem to be fabricated. The Daily Caller News Foundation reviewed several interviews Perry did with the French media and found no mention of cannibalism. No news reporting could be found to corroborate that the alleged admission ever occurred, and her verified social media accounts also make no mention of cannibalism.

An archived version of the website reveals it published the article screen grabbed in the Facebook post in November 2017. Before it stopped publishing, YourNewsWire had articles fact-checked over 80 times, including the one about Perry supposedly making positive comments about cannibalism.\n\nThis is not the first time social media users have shared a false claim about a celebrity that originated on YourNewsWire. The Daily Caller News Foundation recently debunked the claim that Mel Gibsons said Hollywood \u201cis an institutionalized pedophile ring.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
