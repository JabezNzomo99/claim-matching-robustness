Tea made of fenugreek seeds can relieve sore throat temporarily but it cannot be said that it can cure coronavirus.\n\nIn the viral video, it has been stated that fenugreek seed applied on a tape strip if pasted on thumb and left overnight, it can beat throat infection. We tried to find out whether it has any connection with acupuncture. We spoke to an acupuncture specialist in Dr. Lohiya Acupuncture Centre regarding the viral video. He said: \u201cThis is fake. There are points for the throat in hands and we put pressure on those points for relieving throat infections. We perform classic acupuncture on those points. But, this is a fake claim that pasting fenugreek seed tape on the thumb can cure a sore throat. This is completely fake.\u201d\n\nVishvas News also spoke to Dr. Nikhil Modi who is a Pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. He also said that the viral claim is completely fake.\n\nWHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines.\n\nThe most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to:\n\u2022 Clean your hands frequently and thoroughly\n\u2022 Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose\n\u2022 Cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue. If a tissue is used, discard it immediately and wash your hands.\n\u2022 Maintain a distance of at least 1 metre from others.\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named Ravinderjeet Singh. When we scanned the profile of the user we found that the user is based out of New Delhi.\n\nFenugreek seed tape isn\u2019t COVID-19 cure; health experts refute the viral claim.
