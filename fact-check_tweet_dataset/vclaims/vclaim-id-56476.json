Several media outlets have issued corrections and updates to their articles.\n\nBerardelli, who served as the main priest for the Italian town of Casnigo, died from the disease caused by the new coronavirus in March, according to Insider.\n\nNews outlets and social media users shared the story of Berardelli\u2019s death after Italian news website Araberara claimed the 72-year-old gave up a donated ventilator to a younger COVID-19 patient, citing an anonymous employee at San Giuseppe Rest Home. The story appears to be false, however.\n\nCatholic New Agency (CNA) and Crux Now, both religious media publications, reported that associates of Berardelli debunked the claim. Benedetta Franchina, an employee at the rest home, told CNA that her coworkers would likely not know the details of Berardelli\u2019s death because he died in a nearby hospital.\n\n\u201cIt is not like the way that some journalist wrote: that it was a respirator bought for him and then given by him to someone else,\u201d Giulio Dellavite, a fellow priest and friend of Berardelli for over 20 years, said in an interview with CNA.\n\nGiuseppe Foresti, sacristan of Berardelli\u2019s parish, told Crux Now that Berardelli \u201ccouldn\u2019t tolerate\u201d the ventilator because he had a pre-existing condition. BBC News also reported that \u201cclose friends\u201d denied the claim that Berardelli gave up a respirator bought for him to a younger patient.\n\nJames Martin, the editor-at-large for American Magazine, called the story \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cSources from the Bergamo Diocese have also confirmed that the story of the respirator (ventilator) is inaccurate,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nSeveral news outlets, including The Independent and the Daily Mail, have updated or issued corrections to their stories about Berardelli\u2019s death.

At press time, the new coronavirus has killed more than 21,000 people in Italy, making it one of the countries with the highest death tolls, per the Johns Hopkins University Resource Center.", "lang": "en"}
