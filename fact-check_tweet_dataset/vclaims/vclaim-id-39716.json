This is unproven.\n\u2022 None It said four out of every 10 women who died during childbirth in Nigeria had serious complications such as fistula. This was incorrect. \n\n\n\n, which works to improve sexual and reproductive health in\n\nIn a report on the event, national daily\n\nabout the reproductive health of women in the country.\n\nPunch attributed this claim to the\n\n, an arm of the United States\n\nThe centre told Africa Check the claim was from a paper on female genital mutilation in Nigeria. Published in the\n\ndue to its large population, has the highest absolute number of female genital mutilation (FGM) worldwide\u201d.\n\nIt said the national prevalence of FGM was 41% among adult women, citing a 2001 analysis by Unicef, the\n\nby another national daily that 27% of Nigerian women aged 15 to 49 were victims of female genital mutilation or cutting. We found the correct figure to be\n\n, according to the\n\n, which had the most recent data on the practice.\n\nThe survey was prepared by the country\u2019s\n\nand others, from interviews with\n\nNigeria has a lot of cases \u2018but not the highest\u2019\n\nThe most recent data on the share of females who have undergone the procedure is\n\nby Unicef, Dr Edmund Ossai, a lecturer in the department of community medicine at\n\nUnicef and the WHO also referred us to this database. Out of 38 countries, it shows that Somalia has the world\u2019s highest prevalence,\n\n. This is for females aged 15 to 49.\n\nNigeria\u2019s prevalence is given as 18%, with the data\n\nThe database estimates that 200 million women and girls are affected worldwide, Helen Wylie from Unicef\u2019s communication team told Africa Check.\n\nsaid the claim was inaccurate. \u201cNo, this is not correct. Nigeria is home to a large number of girls and women who have undergone FGM, but not the largest.\u201d\n\nAt least three other countries have higher numbers\n\nA larger number of girls and women had undergone the practice in Indonesia, Ethiopia and Egypt, she said. And Nigeria had a lower prevalence than many other countries in Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that compared to other countries, the relatively high number in Nigeria is due more to the large population than to a high risk of FGM.\u201d\n\nBut was the claim of higher absolute numbers correct?\n\nWylie said the age structure of Nigeria\u2019s population and the changing prevalence over time made calculating a national burden \u201csomewhat more complex than a straight product of the national prevalence and the population\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor instance, FGM is less common among the younger cohorts than among the older cohorts, and given the young age structure of Nigeria, this results in a lower sum than if the national prevalence was assumed for all ages.\u201d\n\nNigeria doesn\u2019t account for a quarter of this number, she said.\n\n\u201cNo, this is not correct. Nigeria\u2019s share of this [200 million] number is about 8%,\u201d Wylie said.\n\nHow did Unicef come up with this 8%? Wylie said that for each country, the share of affected females was drawn from the latest available estimates of prevalence among girls and women. For Nigeria, this was the 2016/17 multiple indicator cluster survey, which was then combined with demographic data from the\n\n(UNFPA) told Africa Check that Eugene Kongnyuy, its Nigeria country representative, had been accurately quoted in the Punch\n\nThe claims published [in the article] are facts. 111 were from Nigeria because the country loses over 40,000 maternal lives every year,\u201d said Andat Dasogot, a UNFPA monitoring and evaluation specialist.\n\n, estimates prepared by the WHO, the World Bank and three UN agencies.\n\nThe WHO defines maternal mortality, or a\n\n, as the death of a woman during pregnancy or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, from any cause.\n\nthere were 303,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, or about 830 deaths a day. Uncertainty in counting means the number could be as low as 291,000 or as high as 349,000.\n\nmaternal deaths, and India, with 45,000, were estimated to account for more than a third of all maternal deaths worldwide. In Nigeria, this was about 159 deaths a day.\n\nHowever, the country doesn\u2019t have any recent reliable data on maternal mortality. Its\n\n, which collects internationally comparable information on the situation of women, has no information on it. (\n\nthe director of household statistics at the\n\nsaid the sample size [of 36,176 women] was not large enough to code for it in the survey.\n\n\u201cTo get an accurate estimate of maternal deaths, you need a sample size of not less than 100,000. Anything less than that would not be reliable.\u201d\n\nEugene Kongnyuy, was not specific to the country, as the Punch article suggests. This is according to Andat Dasogot, a UNFPA monitoring and evaluation specialist.\n\n\u201cThe statement \u2018out of every 10 woman that died during childbirth, four had serious injuries such as fistula\u2019, does not only relate to Nigeria,\u201d\n\nHe did not, however, provide us with the source of the data Kongnyuy used.\n\non maternal mortality, 810 women died from preventable or treatable birth\n\ncomplications every day in 2017, the vast majority (86%) in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Other complications that exist before pregnancy become worse during pregnancy if they are not managed.\n\ncomplications that account for nearly 75% of all maternal deaths. These are severe bleeding (mostly bleeding after childbirth), infections (usually after childbirth), high blood pressure during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and eclampsia), complications from delivery, and unsafe abortion.\n\nFistula not direct cause of death\n\n\u201cNo, obstetric fistula doesn't account for 40% of the causes of maternal deaths globally and in Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d Dr Nkurunziza Triphonie, a regional adviser on reproductive and women\u2019s\n\nhealth at the WHO, told Africa Check.\n\nShe said fistula did not cause maternal death. It was rather a cause of maternal chronic morbidity \u2013 or disease.\n\non global causes of maternal deaths published in the Lancet in 2014. This examined\n\nfrom 2003 to 2012, which included 417 datasets from 115 countries covering more than 60,799 deaths.\n\nIt found that 73% of all maternal deaths from 2003 to 2009 had direct obstetric causes, while 27.5% had indirect causes. Complications\n\nlabour accounted for 9.6% of all maternal deaths worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe development of obstetric fistula is directly linked to one of the major causes of maternal mortality: obstructed labour, which is causing up to 9% of maternal deaths,\u201d said Triphonie.", "lang": "en"}
