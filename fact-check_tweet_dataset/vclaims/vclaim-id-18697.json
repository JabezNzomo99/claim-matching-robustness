The signing of the document in question does not make it any more certain that the European Communities Act will be repealed in the UK, nor that we will leave the EU on 31 October 2019.\n\nIt does not guarantee the repeal of\n\nMark Elliot, Professor of Public Law at the University of Cambridge, explained that Mr Barclay has brought into force Section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\n\nThis states: \u201cThe European Communities Act 1972 is repealed on exit day.\u201d\n\nThis is not new legislation. The EU (Withdrawal) Act was passed by Theresa May\u2019s government, and sets out how areas of law currently covered by the EU will function in the UK after Brexit: this will largely involve copying existing EU law into UK law.\n\nMr Barclay was putting this section of the Act into force as the date of Brexit approaches. As the Hansard Society puts it: \u201cThe fact that s.1 of EU(W)A 2018 is now in force does *not* mean that the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972 has now happened.\u201d\n\nProfessor Elliot also states that the legal significance of this is extremely limited.\n\n\u201cIt does not prevent Parliament, if it so wishes, from legislating to revoke the UK\u2019s notification under Article 50, thereby stopping the Brexit process in its tracks.\u201d\n\nParliament had this potential power before Sunday, and it continues to have it following Mr Barclay\u2019s signature. Professor Elliot goes on: \u201cEuropean Communities Act repeal, and Brexit itself, are no more \u201cset in stone\u201d today than they were in the spring\u201d.\n\nIt does not underline that we are leaving on 31 October\n\nMr Barclay also stated that his signature \u201cunderlines that we are leaving the EU on October 31.\u201d\n\nThe section which he brought into force yesterday states that the European Communities Act is repealed \u201con exit day\u201d, which is currently set for 31 October 2019.\n\nYet Professor Elliot points out that \u201cother provisions\u2026 enable the definition of \u201cexit day\u201d to be amended if the date of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU changes under EU Law.\u201d\n\nSo if the date of Brexit were to be delayed (as has already happened twice this year), the date of the repeal of the European Communities Act would be pushed back accordingly.", "lang": "en"}
