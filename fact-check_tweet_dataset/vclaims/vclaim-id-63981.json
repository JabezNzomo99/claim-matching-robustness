The video was 4 minutes and 40 seconds long.\n\nYouTube channel Showbiz Fanaticz originally uploaded the video on August 8. For the most part, the video read out an article by the Philippine Daily Inquirer while a montage of photos of former president Benigno Aquino III, Morales, and Hontiveros appeared on-screen.\n\nInvestigations into PhilHealth conducted by Congress and the task force led by the Department of Justice (DOJ) are still ongoing as of August 19, almost two weeks after the video was uploaded both on YouTube and Facebook. On August 5, the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission recommended the firing or filing of cases against 36 officials, but refused to identify who they were.\n\nThe Inquirer article that was used by the video as a source did not mention Hontiveros, Aquino, or the possibility of life imprisonment for them. The article was instead about President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s order to Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra to organize a task force that will conduct a separate probe into the PhilHealth mess.\n\nMoreover, the content of the video itself did not support its claim that Hontiveros and Morales will now be imprisoned for stealing billions. It only said that whoever found to be guilty of pocketing funds would be sentenced to life in prison.\n\nRappler debunked a similar claim on August 12 that said Hontiveros is \u201cconfirmed\u201d to have stolen P15 billion from PhilHealth. Before that, there were also false claims that the Commission on Audit ordered Hontiveros to return illegal PhilHealth bonuses, and that the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption filed complaints against her for stealing PhilHealth funds.\n\nThere were also previous video uploads by YouTube channel Showbiz Fanaticz that were rated false by Rappler in the past. Among them were a video uploaded in July that wrongly said the Supreme Court had junked ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise renewal, and another uploaded in June that falsely claimed Time magazine honored Duterte. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
