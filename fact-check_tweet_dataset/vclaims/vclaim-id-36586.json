It tries to convey a message that the State Tax on Petrol is much more than the Central Tax. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Price build-up of Petrol shows that the State Tax on Petrol is more than the Central Tax in Delhi. Fact: The amounts of various taxes given in the post are not accurate. In Delhi, the State VAT is only Rs 14.49/Ltr and the Excise Duty on Petrol is Rs 22.98/Ltr. Also, the average Dealer Commission is Rs 3.54/Ltr. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn addition to the tweet shown in the picture, Rishi Bagree has tweeted (archived) that the above price break-up calculation is that of Delhi. On the Indian Oil website, the build-up of the Petrol price in Delhi can be found. The same can be also found on the Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum websites.\n\nSo, let\u2019s compare the price build-up given in the post with the actual petrol price build-up in Delhi.\n\nCrude + Refinery + Logistics \u2013 Rs 26/Ltr? No. \n\nIn the Indian Oil Price build-up, it can be seen that Base Price + Freight etc. add up to Rs 28.28/Ltr.\n\nDealer Commission \u2013 Rs 5/Ltr? No. \n\nOn average, the Dealer Commission is Rs 3.54/Ltr.\n\nCentral Tax \u2013 Rs 14/Ltr net (42% goes to state)? No. \n\nIn the Indian Oil Price build-up, it can be seen that the Excise duty is Rs 22.98/Ltr.\n\nIn the post, it Is being argued that 42% of Rs 22.98/Ltr will go to the State (Delhi), so the net Central Tax is only Rs 14/Ltr. But, on looking at the Finance Act of 2018, it can be found that the Central Tax of Rs 22.98/Ltr also includes Road and Infrastructure Cess (RIC). Recently, the Road and Infrastructure Cess have been increased to Rs 10/Ltr.\n\nThe amount collected as \u2018cess\u2019 (such as Road and Infrastructure Cess) is not shared with the States by the Center. The same can be read in the 15th Finance Commission Report. So, Rs 10 out of Rs 22.98/Ltr is not shared with the States\n\n42% of the remaining shareable Central Tax forms part of the larger resource pool which is shared among the States by the Center according to the proportion suggested by the Finance Commissions. Each State does not get 42% of the amount as suggested in the post. The proportion each state gets in the \u201842%\u2019 can be seen in the 15th Finance Commission Report. Also, Delhi is not among the list of states which get a proportion in the \u201842%\u2019. In the Budget 2020-21, it can be seen that the Centre has allocated Rs 325 crore to Delhi as \u2018Grants in lieu of share in Central Taxes and Duties\u2019. So, 42% of Excise Duty in the Price build-up cannot be directly added to each state (also, not to Delhi).\n\nState Tax \u2013 Rs 24/Ltr? No.\n\nIn India, the tax levied by each state government is different and those tax rates can be seen on the website of \u2018Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell\u2019 of the Central government. As of 18 March 2020, the tax rate levied by Delhi is 27% i.e. Rs 14.79/Ltr.\n\nThe States get a part of Central Tax, but, as discussed above, it is part of the larger tax pool which Centre shares with the states as recommended by the Finance Commission and moreover, Rs. 10 out of the central excise duty is Road & Infrastructure cess, which the central government does not share with the states.\n\nTo sum it up, false inaccurate figures shared as the price build-up of Petrol in Delhi.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
