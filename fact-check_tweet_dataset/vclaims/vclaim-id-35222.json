She also said Sputnik.by\u2019s numbers exceeded the combined audience of all other foreign media in Belarus, naming just two -- U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty [branded Svaboda.org in Belarus] and the BelSat TV channel, which is co-funded by the Polish government and international donors.\n\nAccording to data provided by the market intelligence company SimilarWeb, Sputnik.by \u00adhad 11.16 million total visits in January of this year but only 5.65 million unique visitors -- only about half what Simonyan claimed.\n\nSimilarWeb is a globally recognized company analyzing 80 million websites and 3 million mobile applications in 60 countries.\n\nIn addition, SimilarWeb\u2019s data showed that in January of this year, 74 percent of desktop visits to Sputnik.by were from Russia and only 17 percent from Belarus.\n\nSimilarWeb does not provide geographical data for mobile traffic. However, it reports that 32 percent of all traffic was from desktop computers and 68 percent originated from mobile devices.\n\nThe one correct claim in Simonyan\u2019s tweet was that Sputnik.by\u2019s audience in January exceeded the combined numbers of other foreign-funded media. The Voice of America sister-media, RFE/RL's branch in Belarus, Svaboda.org had about 259,000 unique visitors in January.", "lang": "en"}
