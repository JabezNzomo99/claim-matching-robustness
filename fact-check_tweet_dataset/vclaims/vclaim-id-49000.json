Hair needs cutting. Demokraps don\u2019t want to bite the bullet but that\u2019s the price we have to pay. Some oldies will have to die. We\u2019re in God\u2019s hands, folks! Liberate America\u2019\n\nWhen NewsMobile checked the authenticity of the post, we found it to be FAKE.\n\nWe started our investigation by checking all the tweets made by Prez Trump on May 8, on his official Twitter account (@realDonaldTrump).
