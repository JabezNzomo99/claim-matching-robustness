No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Conservative Tears on December 30, 2018 titled \"Loretta Lynn Enters Hospice - Signs Estate Over To MAGA2020\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLoretta Lynn is losing her 11-year battle with myoblastican carcinomegenic myopsin (cancer of the third vomalcular mistantulin). She will no longer be able to stay in her penthouse at Caesar's Palace and will instead move into the Las Vegas National Cemetery and Hospice House. As a 12-year veteran of World War II, Ms. Lynn will be buried with full military honors when she passes in a site she'll be able to see from her bedroom window until the time comes. Director of Veteran Deaths and Burial Affairs, Art Tubolls, told MSCVR: \"Ms. Lynn will be buried by members of the elite Coast Guard 4th Infantry, which will deliver her 21-gun salute from the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Lake Michigan. The shots will be heard in Loretta's home town of Skokie, Illinois.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they might not have noticed the many hints the story was fake:\n\nThere is no known medical condition named \"myoblastican carcinomegenic myopsin (cancer of the third vomalcular mistantulin)\" and you can't be a 12-year veteran of World War II since the whole thing only took from 1939 to 1945 according to most historians. Lynn was born in Butcher Hollow, Van Lear, Kentucky and not in Skokie according to biographers. There is also no military unit named \"Coast Guard 4th Infantry\" and the USS Ronald Reagan was last seen somewhere near Singapore according to FleetMon.\n\nIn addition the name \"Art Tubbols\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the nickname of the owner of the site. The article was posted under the category \"Satirical Death Disease and Dismemberment\" and there is a disclaimer at the bottom of the page that reads:\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes conservativetears.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
