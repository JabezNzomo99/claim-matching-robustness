While Trump did call Hilton beautiful at this age, he did not call her sexually attractive.\n\nThe full text of the post reads: \u201cDonald Trump told extended story of lusting after 12 year old Paris Hilton, describing how beautiful she was, how sexually attractive she was from the first time he saw her at 12 years old. How, when she walked in the room he felt \u2018boom\u2019!! Here is a photo of what she looked like when Donald Trump was sexually attracted to her.\u201d The post is accompanied by a childhood photograph of Hilton. One example of the post is visible here .\n\nThe remarks attributed to Trump stem from a 2003 interview between Trump and radio personality Howard Stern, re-circulated online ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and now prior to the 2020 election.\n\nThe video of the interview, which is no longer on YouTube, was re-published by the Huffington Post in September 2016 ( here ).\n\nDuring the interview, Trump discussed which women he found or did not find attractive and brought up his daughter Ivanka\u2019s childhood friend, Paris Hilton. The relevant portions of the exchange are transcribed below:\n\nTrump: Somebody who a lot of people don\u2019t give credit to but in actuality is really beautiful, really beautiful, is Paris Hilton. I\u2019ve known Paris Hilton from the time she\u2019s 12, her parents are friends of mine, and, you know, the first time I saw her she walked into the room and I said, \u2018Who the hell is that?\u2019\n\nStern: Did you want to bang her?\n\nTrump: Well, at 12, I wasn\u2019t interested. I\u2019ve never been into that. They\u2019ve sort of always stuck around that 25 (years old) category.\n\nStern: But even at 12, you were kind of like, wow, she\u2019s hot.\n\nTrump: No, but I saw at 12 she was beautiful. Honestly, you know, Paris gets knocked and this and that. But she\u2019s very beautiful.\n\nWhile Trump did remark on Hilton\u2019s looks in this exchange, he did not call the 12-year-old \u201csexually attractive\u201d, nor describe feeling a \u201cboom\u201d when first meeting her, nor did he give indication of \u201clusting after\u201d her, per the post\u2019s wording.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Trump was criticized after a 2005 recording came to light in which he boasted in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with an unidentified married woman and groping women, saying \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\u201d ( here ).\n\nPartly false. In a 2003 interview with Howard Stern, Trump said Paris Hilton was \u201cbeautiful\u201d when she was 12 but did not describe her as \u201csexually attractive\u201d at that age.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
