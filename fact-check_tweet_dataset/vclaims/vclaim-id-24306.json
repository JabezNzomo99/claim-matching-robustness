Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post\n\nFact: This photo is of Rajnath Singh offering condolences on the death of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) President\u2019s brother. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search technique, it was found in the tweet of Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma. Earlier this year, Rajnath Singh has met All India Muslim Personal Law Board President Maulana Rabey Hassan Nadvi to offer condolences on the death of his younger brother Maulana Wajeh Hassan Nadvi. The photo taken in this context is being falsely shared with the narrative of Rajnath Singh visiting a Madrasa to seek the votes of Muslims.\n\nHence, this is the photo of Rajnath Singh meeting All India Muslim Personal Law Board President Maulana Rabey Hassan Nadvi to offer condolences on the death of his brother.", "lang": "en"}
