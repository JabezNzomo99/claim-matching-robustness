The app allows users to report having symptoms of Covid-19 and then notifies people they have come into contact with, advising them on how to get a Covid-19 test.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock was asked by Laura Trott MP in parliament how many people would need to download the app for it to be useful to which he responded:\n\n\n\n\u201cShe is right to say that the more people who download the app, the more people will protect themselves, their families and their communities...according to a very early poll, 80% of people on the Isle of Wight want to download it.\u201d\n\nHe later clarified that the poll was done by Isle of Wight Radio which the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed to us was a Facebook poll, as had been suggested by SNP MP Kirsty Blackman.\n\n79% of respondents said they would download the app. The problem with this is we don\u2019t know to what extent this figure represents the actual views of residents of the Isle of Wight.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, a good survey, by design, asks a group of people (the \u201csample\u201d) what they think, and tries to make sure that those people represent the wider population.\n\nIn this case there was no guarantee that people responding to the survey represented the population of the Isle of Wight. We\u2019re not sure the respondents even live there, and because the poll was done on Facebook it won\u2019t have captured the views of those who don\u2019t use the social network.\n\nAs well as wanting to download the app, there\u2019s also the problem of the fact that there will be a number of people who can\u2019t because they don\u2019t have a smartphone and it seems likely that these people were underrepresented by a poll done on Facebook.\n\nAll in all, the 79% figure can\u2019t be used as a basis for estimating the likely uptake of the app on the Isle of Wight.\n\nBetween 10-13 April, pollsters Ipsos-MORI, surveyed British adults and found 65% supported mobile phone service providers giving the government roaming data to track Covid-19 cases.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t tell us how many would download an app which works in a different way, and the survey was done online so doesn\u2019t represent non-internet users. But it gives some reliable information about the public\u2019s attitude towards these sorts of initiatives.", "lang": "en"}
