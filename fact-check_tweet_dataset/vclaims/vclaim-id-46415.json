The film fraternity, politicians and sportsmen have mourned the demise of the promising and versatile young actor.\n\nMeanwhile, a condolence tweet by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is going viral on social media where he purportedly referred to Rajput as a cricketer and not an actor.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that Rahul Gandhi\u2019s tweet has been morphed. In his original tweet, the Congress leader has referred to Rajput as an actor and not a cricketer.\n\nAmong others, Twitter user \u201cPIYUSH RANJAN ADVOCATE\u201d shared the screenshot of the tweet from Rahul Gandhi\u2019s official Twitter handle that says, \u201cI am sorry to hear about the passing of #SushantSinghRajput. A young & talented Cricketer gone too soon. My condolences to his family, friends & fans across the world.\u201d The archived version can be seen here.\n\nTo verify the claim, we checked Gandhi\u2019s Twitter handle and found the original tweet where he had referred to Rajput as an \u201cactor\u201d and not a \u201ccricketer\u201d.\n\nWe ran a search for any archived version of the tweet but did not find any. Also, the time stamps on the viral and original tweets are the same, i.e. 7.31 pm on June 14, 2020. Even if Gandhi had written \u201ccricketer\u201d and re-posted his tweet after deleting the earlier one, there would have been a difference of at least a minute.\n\nIndia Today had also reported about Gandhi expressing grief on Rajput\u2019s death. The actor was found hanging at his residence in Mumbai\u2019s Bandra on June 14.\n\nThis is not the first time that a fake tweet purportedly made by Gandhi went viral. A few days back, a screenshot of a tweet from his official handle went viral that said, \u201cSchools and colleges should reopen from 1st June on odd/even basis. Odd days teachers will come and even days, students will come.\u201d\n\nIt was found that the Congress leader never made that tweet. Many fact-checkers had clarified that the tweet was fake. So is the viral tweet where Gandhi is seen referring to Rajput as a cricketer and not an actor.", "lang": "en"}
