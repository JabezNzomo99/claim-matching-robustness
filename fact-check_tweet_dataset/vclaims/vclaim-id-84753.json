In the past 30 days its members - majority of whom are men - have generated 444 anti-student posts.\n\nThe group's posts alternate between showing pictures of young people kissing, protesters getting beaten, random pictures of women with either alcohol or condoms, fake posts about the ages of students and angry rants by the admins of the group.\n\nStudents of the public varsity have been protesting since the end of October demanding a complete rollback of a draft hostel manual which proposes a hostel fee hike and changes to dress code and curfew timings. Learn more about the protests here.\n\nThe protests have evoked strong reactions online. The university has developed a reputation for fostering liberal left leaning dissenting voices. It counts noted alumni across the political spectrum such as Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, \n\nNITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant and young politicians such as Kanhaiya Kumar and Shehla Rashid.\n\nThe university's critics - mainly the Hindutva right-wing - however, see it as a breeding ground for communists and secessionists, often referring to its students with disparaging names such as 'Tukde Tukde Gang' and 'Urban Naxals'.\n\nThe protests took a turn for the worse when Swami Vivekananda statue at the university was vandalised. Misinformation entered the mix on November 18, 2019 when Delhi police lathi charged students who were marching to the parliament with their demands.\n\nThe misinformation has largely been designed to portray the students as promiscuous freeloaders, with the worst of it directed toward female students.\n\nThis is also the underlying theme of nearly all of the posts on the group 'Bandh Karo JNU, shut JNU'.\n\nA provocative photo of a woman sipping from a heart-shaped straw in a condom has been posted with a derogatory caption aimed at students. A search for the photo shows it is not related to JNU and can be found on various sleazy websites.\n\n\n\nAnother photo, posted without a caption, shows a woman with alcohol and cigarettes. A reverse image search shows the first instance of the image online was 2015. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest it is related to JNU.

Read BOOM's fact-check here.\n\n\n\nAn image of 30-year-old JNU MPhil student Pankaj Kumar Mishra was falsely shared as 47-year-old 'Moinuddin.' Read BOOM's fact-check here.\n\nThe group also shared a photoshopped iamge of Kanhaiya Kumar, former president of Jawharlal Nehru University\u2019s student union striking an animated pose with a map in the background that shows Kashmir as a part of Pakistan. Read the fact-check here.\n\nOverwhelmingly, the group's posts are aimed at entrenching the perception that the university's students are promiscuous.\n\nActual incidents in the past such as a pornographic video shot on campus in 2011 and the 'Kiss of Love' protest against moral policing in 2014 have made fact-checking such posts difficult.\n\nALSO READ: JNU Protests: Social Media Flooded With Misinformation On Protesters", "lang": "en"}
