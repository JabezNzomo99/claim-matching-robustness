The Director-General (DG) of NCDC, Chikwe Ihekweazu said that the discharged patients were cases managed from home.\n\nHe noted that the difference in number was from Lagos state while explaining that the centre recently provided guidance on reporting cases, not in isolation centres.\n\nIhekewazu tweeted \u201cRecently, we provided guidance to states, to report cases that have recovered but were managed at home. These cases have recovered but were not managed in/discharged from an isolation centre. Lagos has done so and this may apply to more states in the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nEarlier on, the NCDC on August 4 had tweeted that the discharged cases in the daily update included a cumulative 10,946 recovered COVID-19 patients in Lagos State who were being managed at home.\u201d\n\nFrom the information presented above, the claim that Nigeria discharged 11,188 patients in one day is MISLEADING, even though the figures from the NCDC updates shows that, but the result was cumulative over time and not within a 24-hour period.", "lang": "en"}
