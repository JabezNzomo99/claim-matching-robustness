Since her arrest, social media has been brimming with vile personal attacks. Manoj Kumar Azad, who identifies as a BJP member from Muzzafarpur, tweeted on May 4, \u201cUnmarried Jamia law student Safoora Zargar is in Tihar jail on charges of inciting riots. When she was given a coronavirus test in jail, it was found that she is two months pregnant.\u201d\n\nAnother user Sweta Singh who claims to be a member of the RSS shared photographs of Zargar and promoted the same claim.\n\nThat she is unmarried and her pregnancy was discovered during incarceration is a claim viral on social media.\n\nIt has also been promoted using a Bengali text \u2013 \u201c#\u09b6\u09be\u09b9\u09c0\u09a8\u09ac\u09be\u0997 \u09a7\u09b0\u09b0\u09cd\u09a8\u09be\u09df #\u09ac\u09b8\u09be \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09cd\u09b2\u09ac\u09c0 #\u09b8\u09be\u09ab\u09c1\u09b0\u09be_\u099c\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09be\u09b0 \u09a4\u09bf\u09b9\u09be\u09b0 #\u099c\u09c7\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0 \u098f\u0995\u099f\u09bf #\u09ae\u09c7\u09a1\u09bf\u0995\u09c7\u09b2 \u099a\u09c7\u0995\u0986\u09aa\u09c7 #\u09a6\u09c1\u0987 \u09ae\u09be\u09b8\u09c7\u09b0 #\u0997\u09b0\u09cd\u09ad\u09ac\u09a4\u09c0 \u09a7\u09b0\u09be #\u09aa\u09a1\u09bc\u099b\u09c7\u09c7 \u09af\u09be\u09b0 #\u0985\u09b0\u09cd\u09a5 \u09b9\u09b2\u09cb \u0993\u099f\u09be #\u0995\u09bf \u2026\u2026 \u099b\u09bf\u09b2? #\u09b8\u09be\u09ab\u09c1\u09b0\u09be_\u099c\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09be\u09b0 \u098f\u0995\u099c\u09a8 #\u099b\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09c0 \u098f\u09ac\u0982 #\u0985\u09ac\u09bf\u09ac\u09be\u09b9\u09bf\u09a4 \u09b8\u09c7 #\u0995\u09bf \u0995\u09b0\u09c7 #\u0997\u09b0\u09cd\u09ad\u09ac\u09a4\u09c0 \u09b9\u09df? #\u09b6\u09be\u09b9\u09c0\u09a8\u09ac\u09be\u0997 \u098f\u09b0 \u09b8\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09a5\u0995\u09b0\u09be \u098f\u09b0 \u0989\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\u09b0 \u09a6\u09bf\u09a8\u0964\u201d\n\nBefore we begin this fact-check it is important to point out here that women are routinely targetted on social media with sexist and distasteful comments. The harassment is viler if they hail from a minority community. Zargar\u2019s personal life has no bearing on her case yet certain people attempted to tarnish her ad reputation with hominem attacks.\n\nWe have witnessed this culture before. Female voices on social media \u2013 activists, authors, journalists or student leaders \u2013 are attempted to be shunned with derogatory remarks. Personal attack is the easiest route. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if a woman is married or not. How she chooses to conceive is her choice. A mother is a mother. It is a shame that right-wing trolls cannot even show respect for an expectant mother. Such attacks prove that the government does not have a case against her. It shows the kind of ugly majoritarianism unleashed by forces emboldened under the Modi government\u2019s protection,\u201d Shehla Rashid, former vice-president of JNU students\u2019 union, told Alt News. Rashid is a prominent voice on social media who regularly finds herself at the receiving end of cyberbullying. Her Muslim identity, just as Zargar\u2019s, attracts the worst form of trolling.\n\nSocial media claims suggesting Safoora Zargar is an unmarried woman are false. Alt News spoke with Zargar\u2019s husband who informed that they have been married since 2018.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that her pregnancy was recently discovered in prison is also false. It was already in news since early April when Zargar was taken into custody. Below is a screenshot of an IANSreport from April 12. It says that a plea for bail was filed in the court citing Zargar was three months pregnant when she was arrested on April 10.\n\nA report in Al Jazeerastates that Zargar had fainted during a scuffle between the police and students on February 10 and had to be hospitalised briefly. \u201cSince then, with her advancing pregnancy a concern, she had gradually restricted her physical movement. And after the outbreak of COVID-19, she had virtually stopped stepping out of the house except for essential work. She was mostly working from home,\u201d her husband is quoted as saying.\n\nAnother court application filed on April 21, requesting bail, also refers to her medical condition.\n\n\u201cDespite it being in the public domain that Safoora is married, a false impression is being created through motivated and malicious posts. It is evident that this issue is being raked up with the motive and hope of maligning her and the anti-CAA Shaheen Bagh movement with which she is associated. Safoora\u2019s pregnancy is relevant to her incarceration. There is a serious concern that her health and well being will be adversely affected in jail,\u201d said women\u2019s rights activist and lawyer Vrinda Grover to Alt News.\n\n\u201cSpreading allegations and misinformation about women\u2019s personal lives, creating the impression that women ought to be ashamed about aspects of their sexuality, is a common patriarchal and misogynist weapon, intended to undermine their politics. This has a chilling effect and deters women from being active in public life. It demonstrates how difficult it is for women and particularly young, bold women from marginalised groups to participate in civic discourse. It is a despicable and dastardly attempt to delegitimise her voice, the politics she espouses, and the movement that she is part of. Instead of engaging with the critical questions raised by Safoora on the unconstitutionality of CAA, she is sought to be silenced by questioning her morality,\u201d continued Grover.\n\nSocial media claims suggesting that Safoora Zargar is an unmarried woman are therefore false. The claim that her pregnancy was discovered in prison is also baseless.", "lang": "en"}
