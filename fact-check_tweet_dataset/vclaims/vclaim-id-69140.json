(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post includes a screenshot of a post by the Facebook page Donald Trump Quotes. We were unable to locate the original post on their page. Either way, the page is not an official communication channel for Trump.\n\nWe found no announcement of the sort as we scrolled through Trump\u2019s tweets, Facebook posts and White House accounts, as well as Defense Department press releases.\n\nTrump did, however, tweet that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to look into a situation with farmers in South Africa.\n\n\"I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers,\" Trump tweeted on Aug. 22.\n\nTrump seemed to be quoting a report by Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson. He\u2019s talking about a legal battle over land rights unfolding in South Africa. There are very few actual statistics that show racially based farm violence. The last time our colleagues Africa Check fact-checked farm murders in 2017, they found 57.\n\nIt isn\u2019t true that Trump is sending troops to South Africa. He never said that.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
