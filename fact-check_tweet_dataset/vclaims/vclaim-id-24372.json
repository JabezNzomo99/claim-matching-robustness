During his presidency, Obama awarded the medal to more than 110 recipients.\n\nThe Facebook post in question criticizes Democrats for allegedly awarding the medal to Clinton, Cosby, Weiner and Weinstein, who have each been accused or convicted of sexual misconduct. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a sexual predator award,\u201d the caption remarks.\n\nClinton was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1998 for lying under oath and for obstruction of justice, both charges arising out of a sexual harassment lawsuit brought against him by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. The Senate subsequently acquitted Clinton on both articles of impeachment.\n\nIn 2017, Weiner was convicted of transferring obscene material to a minor and sentenced to 21 months in prison. He was released from federal custody a few months early in May.\n\nCosby was convicted in 2018 of aggravated indecent assault and sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. He remains incarcerated. Weinstein, on the other hand, is currently awaiting trial after being charged in 2018 with several counts of sexual assault and rape.\n\nThough Obama awarded the Medal of Freedom to Clinton in 2013, he never awarded it to Cosby, Weiner or Weinstein, contrary to the claims of the Facebook post. Neither Weinstein nor Weiner has ever received the medal, while Cosby was given the award in 2002 by former President George W. Bush.

A photo of Cosby\u2019s head appears to have been photoshopped onto a 2016 image of musician Bruce Springsteen. Images of Weinstein\u2019s and Weiner\u2019s heads seem to have been superimposed onto a 2017 photo of former Vice President Joe Biden and a 2016 photo of actor Tom Hanks, respectively.\n\nDespite his sexual assault conviction, which he appealed in June, Cosby has not been stripped of the Medal of Freedom. \u201cThere is no precedent for revoking a medal,\u201d Obama said after being asked about the allegations in 2015, before Cosby was convicted. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that mechanism.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
