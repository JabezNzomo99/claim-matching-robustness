However, there have not been thousands of deaths in the \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria, she and other experts told us.\n\n\u201cThere has been a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey (inside Turkey, not in Syria) since 1984,\u201d Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f said. \u201cBut none of the fighting ever happened in Syria or Syrian terrain. There is no record of a fight between Turkey and the PKK in northern Syria.\u201d\n\nTrump made his remarks in an Oct. 27 press conference announcing the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Specifically, Trump was asked if the successful U.S. raid that resulted in al-Baghdadi\u2019s death gave any reason to reconsider his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria, where Syrian Kurds backed by U.S. forces have been guarding 10,000 Islamic State prisoners.\n\nOn Oct. 6, the White House announced it would withdraw U.S. forces in northern Syria and that Turkey would soon move \u201cforward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria.\u201d Trump\u2019s decision prompted bipartisan criticism, because the Turkish military operation was designed to forcibly remove the Syrian Kurds \u2014 known as the People\u2019s Protection Units, or the YPG \u2014 from Turkey\u2019s border in northern Syria. Even Trump\u2019s Republican supporters, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, criticized the president for abandoning the Syrian Kurds and opening the door to an Islamic State comeback.\n\nAlthough the YPG has been a U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State, Turkey views the Syrian Kurds as an \u201caffiliate\u201d of the PKK, which Turkey and the U.S. have designated as a terrorist group. Turkey believes the presence of the YPG on its border with Syria poses a threat to its country, as Fahrettin Altun, Turkey\u2019s communications director, explained in a recent Washington Post op-ed. The U.S. does not consider YPG to be a terrorist group, but it has \u201cacknowledged that ties exist between them and the PKK,\u201d the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a January report.\n\nThree days after Trump withdrew U.S. forces, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan started what he called \u201c#OperationPeaceSpring against PKK/YPG and Daesh terrorists in northern Syria.\u201d Daesh is another name for the Islamic State or ISIS.\n\nThe Turkish operation in northern Syria resulted in dozens of deaths of civilians and Kurdish fighters, before a pause in the fighting allowed the YPG to leave the area. In his op-ed, Turkey\u2019s communications director urged the world to support its creation of a \u201csafe zone,\u201d which he described as a \u201c20-mile secure area spanning from the Euphrates River to the Syria-Iraq border.\u201d\n\nIn his press conference, Trump said he was \u201cglad\u201d he \u201cwas able to help\u201d Turkey establish a \u201csafe zone\u201d \u2014 but, in doing so, he made his false claim about deaths \u201cfrom that safe zone.\u201d\n\nThree experts we interviewed said the president is wrong.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump specifically said they have been fighting in the \u2018safe zone\u2019 area that he gave to Turkish control,\u201d Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f said. \u201cAgain, no recorded history of that ever. Turkey has not \u2018lost thousands of people in that safe zone.'\u201d\n\nHenri Barkey, a professor of international relations at Lehigh University and adjunct senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, was blunt: \u201cThis is complete nonsense. He is making things up,\u201d Barkey said.\n\nAmanda Sloat, a senior fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, didn\u2019t say Trump was \u201cmaking things up,\u201d but rather \u201cconflating\u201d Turkey\u2019s ongoing fight against the PKK in Turkey with the perceived threat from the YPG across the border in Syria.\n\n\u201cTurkey has long been fighting the PKK. Estimates that appear frequently in the press and reports are that 40,000 people have died as a result of the fighting between the Turkish state [and] the PKK,\u201d Sloat said, referring us to a Sept. 13 story in Al-Jazeera about a roadside bombing that killed seven in southeast Turkey. \u201cSo the \u2018thousands\u2019 who have died are in Turkey as a result of fighting with the PKK, not in Syria as a result of fighting with the YPG there.\u201d\n\nThe CIA also reports that the conflict in Turkey has resulted in 40,000 deaths.\n\nBut, Sloat said, \u201cPKK (in Turkey) are linked to YPG (in Syria),\u201d and \u201cTurkey has long wanted a safe zone.\u201d She said Erdogan since 2013 has been calling for a safe zone \u201cin Syria to push the YPG off its border and to prevent them from connecting several cantons and creating an autonomous Kurdish region, which he believes would threaten Turkish security.\u201d\n\nThat threat, however, has not resulted in \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of Turkish deaths in northern Syria, contrary to Trump\u2019s claim. Those deaths occurred as a result of a decades-old conflict inside Turkey\u2019s borders.", "lang": "en"}
