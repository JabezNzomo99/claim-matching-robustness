Now our health care workers are dying because of no PPE.\"\n\nThe post from Blue Dem Warriors was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the information is largely accurate.\n\nThe State Department announced on Feb. 7 that it had \"facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.\"\n\nThe Facebook post cited as its source of information a CNN editorial criticizing the shipment.\n\nThe move came more than two weeks after the first U.S. coronavirus case was detected in Washington state on Jan. 21. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Feb. 7 that the delivery would \"help save lives\" in China, which had reported more than 31,000 cases by then.\n\nPompeo touted the assistance again in remarks to reporters on March 31, saying it was an example of American generosity and part of an effort to keep the virus contained to China.\n\nThe materials sent to China, Pompeo said, were donated by Samaritan\u2019s Purse, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and other private organizations. Boeing and Intermountain Healthcare were also involved, according to a Feb. 15 State Department press release.\n\nOn Feb. 7, the State Department also pledged to commit up to $100 million in existing funds to assist China and other countries. A State Department spokesperson told us the $100 million promise has been fulfilled with funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThe U.S. aid to date also includes about $110 million in humanitarian assistance for up to 64 different countries and roughly $64 million in refugee-related assistance for the United Nations.\n\nThe spokesperson told us the security and health of Americans comes first, but that \"the spread of COVID-19 is a threat to our shared international security\" and that efforts aimed at responding to the virus abroad are also meant to help mitigate the spread in the U.S.\n\nWe won\u2019t weigh in on whether the distribution of donated protective equipment to China was the right move. But the Facebook post is correct that the U.S. announced the delivery in February. Other fact-checkers said the same about a similar claim from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.\n\nThe Facebook post also notes that the timing of the China shipment coincided with a press conference in which the World Health Organization sounded the alarm about a \"limited stock\" of personal protective equipment.\n\nThat\u2019s accurate. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Feb. 7 of a potential supply shortage across the globe and especially in China. The warning was for the world, not the U.S. in particular.\n\n\"The world is facing severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment,\" Ghebreyesus said. \"Demand is up to 100 times higher than normal and prices are up to 20 times higher.\"\n\nGhebreyesus said the situation was made worse by people outside of patient care using masks, for example. He said health workers and caretakers should be first to receive items from the limited stock, and that health workers in China needed \"the bulk of PPE supplies.\"\n\n\"WHO discourages stockpiling of (personal protective equipment) in countries and areas where transmission is low,\" he said.\n\nThe Facebook post closes by saying \"our health care workers are dying because of no PPE.\"\n\nNews reports indicate that some health workers \u2014 who are at an increased risk of exposure \u2014 are among the more than 200,000 infected Americans and over 4,500 who have died. Doctors and nurses have made shortages known and are tweeting the hashtag #GetMePPE.\n\nSome medical supplies are now coming into the U.S. from abroad. The White House arranged for the transport of tons of equipment from China, and the New England Patriots recently lent its team plane to pick up 1.2 million N95 masks from China for Massachusetts\u2019 health workers.\n\nWe asked the State Department whether any of the donated materials sent to China in February made their way back to the U.S., and whether the donations would have gone straight to U.S. hospitals had they not been shipped overseas. We didn\u2019t get answers to those questions.\n\nA Facebook post said: \"On February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China.\"\n\nThe State Department announced the delivery of nearly 18 tons of donated materials on Feb. 7, the same day that the WHO sounded the alarm about the world\u2019s supply of personal protective equipment. The donated materials came from private groups.", "lang": "en"}
