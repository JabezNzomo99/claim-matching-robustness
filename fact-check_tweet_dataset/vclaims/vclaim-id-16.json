Posts featuring the cover of \u201cThe Eyes of Darkness\u201d book and a page in which Koontz allegedly describes the coronavirus in his novel have at least 39,000 shares (examples here and here) and at least 2,000 retweets on Twitter (examples here and here) as of February 27, 2020.\n\nMost of the claims circulating on social media show the book\u2019s cover and a page in the book mentioning a virus called \u201cWuhan-400\u201d. The widely circulated photo of Koontz\u2019s book page includes some highlighted text reading: \u201cThey call the stuff \u2018Wuhan-400\u2019 because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside of the city of Wuhan, and It was the four-hundredth viable strain of man-made microorganisms created at that research center\u201d.\n\nSome claims circulating also include an additional page that mentions the year 2020 and the outbreak of a \u201csevere pneumonia-like illness\u201d.\n\nThis is partly false. While it is true that Koontz wrote about a fictional virus in his novel and that its name \u201cWuhan-400\u201d refers the Chinese city in which the 2019 Coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) (here) actually started, the illness in his book doesn\u2019t share more traits with COVID-19.\n\nIn his novel, Koontz described \u201cWuhan-400\u201d as \u201cChina\u2019s most important and dangerous: new biological weapon in a decade\u201d. He also wrote it was developed by labs outside of the city of Wuhan.\n\nThere is no proof that the new coronavirus was created in a lab. The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a food market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife (see here). Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species.\n\nReuters looked at further references of \u201cWuhan-400\u201d in Koontz\u2019s book.\n\nThe symptoms and behavior of Koontz\u2019s \u201cWuhan-400\u201d are very different to COVID-19. In the novel, the virus has an incubation period of \u201conly four hours\u201d. COVID-19\u2019s incubation period is between 1-14 days. According to World Health Organization (here), the most common incubation time is around five days.\n\nKoontz also describes \u201cWuhan-400\u201d as a disease with a \u201ckill-rate\u201d of a 100%. \u201cOnce infected, no one lives more than twenty-four hours. Most die in twelve\u201d, he writes. COVID-19\u2019s death rate is far from this, according to the WHO, the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan (here).\n\nThe symptoms described by Koontz are different to COVID-19. In his novel, \u201cWuhan-400\u201d causes the secretion of a \u201ctoxin that literally eats away brain tissue\u201d causing loss of control of bodily function. \u201cThe victim simply ceases to have a pulse, functioning organs, or any urge to breathe\u201d, writes Koontz. Meanwhile COVID-19 infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n\nIn the novel, \u201cWuhan-400\u201d is described to be \u201cinfinitely worse\u201d than Ebola (EVD), but COVID-19 is less threatening than EVD. According to the WHO, the average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%, while case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks (see here). The new coronavirus death-rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n\nIt is worth noting that in the first edition of \u201cThe Eyes of Darkness\u201d in 1981, the fictional virus was not named after the Chinese city, but after a Russian locality named \u201cGorki\u201d (Gorki-400). In the original version of the novel, the virus was developed outside of \u201cGorki\u201d and it was meant to be the \u201cSoviet\u2019s most important, dangerous new biological weapon in the decade\u201d. This is confirmed by a Google Books\u2019 search of the word \u201cWuhan\u201d in the 1981 edition (here). In this edition \u201cWuhan-400\u201d brings no results.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, the name of the virus was changed on the re-release of the book in 1989, toward the end of the Cold War. Their article here includes photographs of the previous edition that references \u201cGorki-400\u201d). In this edition, Koontz also published his novel under his real name instead of using his pseudonym \u201cLeigh Nichols\u201d.\n\nReuters tried to contact the author and the publisher but is yet to receive an answer.\n\nSome of the posts on social media also share a third image of a book page without any attribution (here), wrongly suggesting it is part of the same book. This page reads: \u201cIn around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments\u201d.\n\nThis page does not belong to \u201cThe Eyes of Darkness\u201d. It comes from the 2008 book \u201cEnd Of Days: Predictions and prophecies about the end of the world\u201d by Sylvia Browne, an American author who claimed to be a psychic (see the page here).\n\nThis claim is therefore partly false. Dean Koontz did write about a fictional virus called \u201cWuhan-400\u201d in the 1989 re-release of his 1981 novel \u201cThe Eyes of Darkness\u201d, but symptoms and effects of the disease do not match the official description of COVID-19. The additional page present in some claims suggesting an outbreak \u201caround 2020\u201d is from a different book.\n\nPartly false: Dean Kootz wrote about a fictional virus called \u201cWuhan-400\u201d, but its description has nothing to do with the new coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
