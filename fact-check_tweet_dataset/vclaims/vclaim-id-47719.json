He tried to explain to his employees that India is indirectly handling COVID-19 situation of so many countries. It\u2019s about the management of the problem in an efficient manner.\u201d the post read.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found that the map is old.\n\nOn putting the image through Reverse Image Search, we found that the same map has been tweeted in 2016.\n\nErik Solheim, Norwegian diplomat and former politician shared the photo on 29 April 2016 with a caption: \u201cIndia population now at 1250 mill. Look at this map \u2013 India is not just another country \u2013 it\u2019s enormous!\u201d India population now at 1250 mill.\n\n Look at this map \u2013 India is not just another country \u2013 it\u2019s enormous! pic.twitter.com/IKn4Q4BY10 Replying to a tweet, Solheim also clarified that the map is meant to show a comparison based on population size.\n\nWe also ran a search using relevant keywords to check if there\u2019s an American CEO who has drafted such a map, but we did not find any credible report to support the claim.\n\nNewsMobile independently couldn\u2019t verify the origin of the map but it can be safely said that the map is not related to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
