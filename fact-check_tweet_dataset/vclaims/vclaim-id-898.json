Switzerland is not in the EU, and it exports more per person to the EU than we do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s correct that Switzerland\u2014which isn\u2019t a member of the EU\u2014exports more per person to the EU than the UK. The EU imported \u20ac20,000 of goods and services per person from Switzerland in 2015, compared to \u20ac5,000 per person from the UK.\n\nThe figures are a little unreliable, as they can change depending on whether you look at what both countries say they export to the EU, or what the EU says it imports from them.\n\nSwitzerland has some access to the EU\u2019s single market, in return for adapting its laws to match EU laws in certain cases. It also makes a financial contribution.", "lang": "en"}
