We decided to see if Lew was right.\n\nLooking at the data\n\na small, but steady increase in the number of people leaving Puerto Rico for the mainland. More than 360,000 people went from Puerto Rico to the United States btween 2010 and 2014.\n\nHowever, the Census data isn\u2019t out for 2015, which is the year Lew was talking about.\n\nSo where did Lew get that figure?\n\nThe estimate comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation, which tracks passengers departing from and arriving to the island. The Treasury Department has relied on this data , according to department spokesperson Daniel Watson.\n\nThe data show about 90,000 more people left Puerto Rico for the United States than came in.\n\n* showing total out-migration of Puerto Rico to the US mainland\n\nNone of this data includes people leaving Puerto Rico for somewhere other than the United States. Islanders mostly tend to head to the mainland, however, countries in Latin America, the Dominican Republic and Spain have been attracting Puerto Ricans as well. So the total number of migrants leaving the island is actually larger.\n\nRecent qualitative interviews by researchers from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies found that the people leaving Puerto Rico in the greatest numbers are nurses, paramedics, police officers, teachers, college professors and lawyers. They are often recruited and going to states with growing Hispanic populations in need of bilingual professionals.\n\nThe surge in departures has led to the social media tag #yonomequito (\"I am not going anywhere\"). On Facebook this movement has been liked by .\n\nLew said that \"almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year.\"\n\nThat appears to be close. Airline data suggests about 89,000 more people departed Puerto Rico for the United States then entered it in 2015. While that\u2019s not a perfect estimate to measure out-migration, all the population trends suggest Puerto Rico is experiencing a surge in out-migration, as residents leave for better jobs and prospects in the United States.", "lang": "en"}
