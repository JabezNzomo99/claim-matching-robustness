The rallies were initiated by students who survived a shooting at their high school in Florida on Feb. 14.\n\nNobody was shot at any of the events, according to a search of the Nexis news database, which turned up no reports of shootings at the rallies.\n\nBut a story has been posted on several dubious websites with the headline: \u201cBREAKING: 19 Shot During Anti-Gun March \u2013 Media DEAD SILENT.\u201d\n\nFacebook users flagged it as potentially false. The headline is certainly misleading. The story itself is a mixture of opinion and a list of people who were shot in Chicago over the weekend in incidents unrelated to that city\u2019s march.\n\nThe top of the story strikes a disparaging tone, saying of march participants, \u201cThey consistently carried signs that made no sense, were factually inaccurate, or lacked proper spelling because they are not paying enough attention in class.\u201d\n\nThen it includes a round-up of some of the shootings in Chicago \u2014 from the night of March 23 to the early morning hours of March 26 \u2014 that were compiled by the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nAlthough there was a \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d rally in Chicago on March 24, it was held in Union Park, which is about 30 blocks from the location of the nearest shooting that weekend.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nRossman, Sean. \u201cAerial images from March for Our Lives rallies around the world shows huge turnout.\u201d USA Today. 24 Mar 2018.\n\nLong, Zach. \u201cPhotos from the Chicago March for Our Lives rally in Union Park.\u201d Time Out Chicago. 26 Mar 2018.", "lang": "en"}
