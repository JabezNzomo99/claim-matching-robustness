Reuters could not corroborate that Trump ever said there were hundreds of governors calling him.\n\nThe claim may have stemmed from the president\u2019s remarks at a coronavirus task force press briefing on April 13, 2020.

Do we have enough equipment to handle that peak?\u201d (See 0:30 here ). He did not claim that the U.S. has more than 50 state governors, but rather referred to governors of the five major U.S. territories: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (www.nga.org/governors/).\n\nIt is unclear when this claim began, but Reuters was able to find an example dating back to April 19 (here ).\n\nFalse: Trump did not say that \u201chundreds of governors\u201d were calling him.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
