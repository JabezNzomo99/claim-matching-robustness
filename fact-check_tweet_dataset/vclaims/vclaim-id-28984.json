This could become a cause for explosion. Please fill only half talk and leave some room for air. This week, 5 such incidents took place due to excessive filling of petrol. Kindly open the petrol tank once a day to release the built up gas inside.\n\nNote: Send this message to your family members and others, so that they may be saved from such disaster.\u201d\n\nThe above message in Hindi has been circulating on WhatsApp, warning citizens not to fill the fuel tanks of their vehicles to the maximum limit, as it may lead to explosion due to rising heat. The message has been attributed to Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.\n\nSome followers had requested verification of this information. Alt News found that this message in Hindi had circulated in 2016 on Facebook, along with a video which showed a bike at a petrol pump catching fire, before it is extinguished. The same claim had been shared in 2018 as well, along with another video.\n\nIt had appeared on Twitter as well in 2016.\n\nThe state-owned oil and gas company had issued a clarification on Twitter in June 2018, disowning the statement attributed to it. It further added that it is absolutely safe to fill the fuel tank to the maximum limit.\n\nIt may be noted that Indian Oil had issued the same clarification in 2017 as well. Alt News found that this rumour has been circulating in India at least since 2015.\n\nThe claim that filling up the fuel tank in the vehicle to the maximum limit will trigger an explosion, makes little scientific sense. This is because the auto-ignition temperature (the minimum temperature required to ignite a gas or vapour in air without a spark or flame being present) for petrol is 495\u00b0F or 257\u00b0C. This is way higher than the temperature that an insulated tank can attain in summers with the highest recorded temperature on earth being 56.7\u00b0C (134\u00b0F), which was measured on 10 July 1913 at Greenland Ranch, Death Valley, California, USA.\n\nThe claim that a full tank in searing heat will lead to explosion, is not restricted to India. In May 2018, Pakistan State Oil had clarified via a Facebook post that it had not issued any such warning to customers.\n\nIn UAE, the rumour had gone viral as early as 2012, through a spate of email warning customers against filling up their fuel tanks.\n\nIndian Oil Corp Ltd. has issued no such warning asking customers to refrain from filling up their fuel tanks. This is a rumour which has been shared primarily on WhatsApp.", "lang": "en"}
