Scott Walker as a spender and borrower, saying she would not have grown the state budget the way he has in his first term.\n\nIn terms of spending, the Alma Democrat said at a suburban Milwaukee home on Dec. 5, 2013 she would \"get rid of some things that we probably don't really need,\" according to a of part of the meeting.\n\n\"Like, I like to pick on the 80 new, brand-new vehicles that the governor bought,\" she told the group. \"We probably don't need 80 new, brand-new vehicles. So, get rid of that.\"\n\nBy emphasizing \"brand new,\" Vinehout suggests the vehicle purchases are unnecessary or excessive.\n\nSo let\u2019s peek into the garage.\n\nVinehout made her claim in tandem with two statements critical of Walker\u2019s budgeting.\n\nthe governor\u2019s 2013-\u201915 budget \"spends $4 billion more\" than his 2011-\u201913 budget, Vinehout made a claim similar to one made by Democrat Mary Burke, the only announced candidate for governor in 2014. We rated Burke\u2019s statement, that the state budget had grown $4.6 billion under Walker, as .\n\nThe figure was accurate, but the increase is due almost completely to Medicaid costs, not budget decisions Walker made.\n\nVinehout also said Walker\u2019s two budgets led to a record percentage of state tax money being spent on debt payments. That also earned a .\n\nThe 5.26 percent of general fund revenue is the highest on record, but it reached that level because of the borrowing and debt restructuring done by previous governors, as well as by Walker.\n\nVinehout is for a fractured arm she suffered in a car accident on Dec. 8, 2013 and was unavailable to comment. Her chief of staff, Linda Kleinschmidt, cited an appropriation in Walker's 2013-\u201915 budget, but said she did not know why Vinehout singled it out for criticism.\n\nThe appropriation is for in 2013-\u201914, an increase of 15 percent over the previous year, and the same amount in 2014-\u201915, for a total of $2.28 million. The vehicles would be for Central Fleet, which is overseen by Walker's Department of Administration and manages about 1,500 of the state\u2019s vehicles.\n\nThe budget authorizes purchasing a total of 80 vehicles, but more specifically calls for adding 38 vehicles in 2013-\u201914 and 38 more the next year, for a total of 76.\n\nAs of mid-December 2013 no vehicles had yet been purchased but planning is underway, according to Stephanie Marquis, spokeswoman for the Department of Administration.\n\nSo, Walker\u2019s budget authorizes the purchase of 80 vehicles, but to this point, he hasn\u2019t bought any.\n\nWalker spokesman Tom Evenson said the purchases are aimed at saving money. He cited another from the fiscal bureau.\n\nThat memo says the Walker administration believes owning more vehicles will mean spending less on leasing vehicles and less on reimbursing state employees for work use of their personal cars. For example, the administration says the state-owned vehicles cost an average of 35 cents per mile to operate, while the per-mile state reimbursement rate to employees is 51 cents.\n\nAll told, the Walker administration estimates the state will save $563,700 over the two-year budget if 76 vehicles are purchased.\n\nSo, the purchases aren\u2019t simply adding spending but rather are aimed at saving money in the long run.\n\nVinehout said Walker bought \"80 new, brand-new vehicles\" for the state that \"we probably don\u2019t need.\"\n\nWalker did add money to the state budget to buy roughly 80 more vehicles. But he hasn\u2019t bought any yet and, despite Vinehout\u2019s characterization of the purchases being an unnecessary expense, they are aimed at saving money.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.\n\nTo comment on this article, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's website.", "lang": "en"}
