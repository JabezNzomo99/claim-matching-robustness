Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin. Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again. Well, he could start by actually making things in America again.\"\n\nAre all these Trump-brand products really made abroad? Let\u2019s check it out.\n\nWe saw a \"made in China\" label on a Trump tie for sale on eBay, and here\u2019s another one on Amazon. Many are listed as \"imported,\" and we haven\u2019t come across any that were definitely made in the United States.\n\nAt least one image of a Trump suit with a \"made in Mexico\" label has surfaced, and Trump has acknowledged he has made some of his clothing line there. We also found examples of Trump suits made in India and China. But we actually found quite a few for sale on Amazon that were made in the United States.\n\nThe Trump Home by Dorya line \u2013 described in a press release as \"inspired by the diverse locations and architecture of Trump properties around the globe\" \u2013 is manufactured in Turkey.\n\nWe could only find one Trump picture frame, and the Amazon page does not indicate where it was made. It lists the producer as IMAX, which is an Oklahoma-based company, though it does have facilities in India.\n\nBut not all Trump products are made overseas.\n\nSome Trump products are made in the United States, including the candidate\u2019s iconic \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap, which is manufactured in California. We gave a Pants on Fire rating in October to a claim made by Twitter users that the hats were made in China.\n\nIn a previous fact check, we found that some Trump-brand bedding, cologne, Trump Natural Spring Water and Trump Wine are also made in the United States.\n\nClinton says Trump ties are made \"in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.\"\n\nWe found examples of Trump ties made in China, suits in Mexico and furniture in Turkey. We did not find a clear example of a Trump picture frame made in India.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting we also came across suits listed as made in the United States, as well as other Trump-brand products that Clinton did not name, including the \"Make America Great Again\" baseball caps.", "lang": "en"}
