But that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts of south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants.\n\nObservatory head Rami Abdurrahman said that they include seasoned militants who have fought global wars of jihad since the 1990s.\n\nThe SDF, a Kurdish-led force that is America\u2019s only military partner in Syria, said on 20 December, \u201cThe war against Islamic State has not ended and the group has not been defeated.\u201d The group is at the front lines of the battle against ISIS along the Euphrates river. It said that a US withdrawal would leave Syrians \u201cbetween the claws of enemy forces.\u201d\n\nAt their height in 2014, ISIS militants controlled approximately a third of territory in Syria and Iraq, including major cities in both countries. The group flourished in the political vacuum of Syria\u2019s civil war, in which President Bashar Assad has violently put down a 2011 uprising against his family\u2019s 40-year rule.", "lang": "en"}
