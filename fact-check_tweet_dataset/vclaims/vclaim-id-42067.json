Both said later they told Lavrov that Russian interference in U.S. elections was unacceptable and would not be tolerated.\n\nLavrov and Pompeo held a lengthy news conference after their meeting.\n\n\u201cOn the question of interference in our domestic affairs, I was clear: It\u2019s unacceptable and I made our expectations of Russia clear,\u201d Pompeo stated in opening remarks. \u201cThe Trump administration will always work to protect the integrity of our elections -- period. Should Russia or any foreign actor take steps to undermine our democratic processes we will take action in response.\u201d\n\nLavrov spent a large portion of his remarks denying any interference.\n\n\u201cWe have highlighted once again that all speculations about our alleged interference in the domestic processes in the United States are baseless. There were no facts that support that. We did not see these facts. No one has given us these proofs because simply they don\u2019t exist,\u201d Lavrov said.\n\nLavrov said Russia has \u201cproposed multiple times\u201d that Moscow and Washington \u201cput on paper\u201d a memorandum of \u201cmutual non-interference in each other\u2019s domestic affairs.\u201d\n\nWashington Post correspondent John Hudson brought up the election interference issue. \u201cWhy not just read the Mueller report? It is very detailed when it comes to U.S. allegations related to meddling in the 2016 elections,\u201d he asked Lavrov, referring to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s nearly two-year investigation into whether the Trump campaign had improperly worked with Russians.\n\nLavrov responded: \u201cNow as for meddling or non-meddling. You suggested to simply read the Mueller report. We read it. There is no evidence of any collusion.\u201d\n\nLavrov\u2019s claims that there\u2019s no evidence of Russian interference are false.\n\nIn fact, Mueller\u2019s final report rejected the concept of \u201ccollusion,\u201d a term not in criminal law, instead examining whether the Trump campaign coordinated or conspired with Russians. The report describes numerous efforts by Russian hackers and others to interfere in the presidential election to Trump\u2019s benefit.\n\nMueller concluded there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to criminally charge Trump campaign officials for conspiring with Russians. In February 2018, however, Mueller\u2019s team indicted 13 Russian nationals involved in a social media propaganda operation to subvert the election. Also indicted was the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency, where many of the indicted individuals worked.\n\nMueller\u2019s report wasn\u2019t the only investigation of Russian meddling. Others include:\n\u2022 The FBI counterintelligence investigation code-named \u201cCrossfire Hurricane,\u201d launched July 2016. The details of that investigation were not publicly disclosed; however some clues come from the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee in August 2017. When asked whether he had \u201cany doubt that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 elections\u201d Comey answered \u201cNone.\u201d He repeated the same answer when asked about Russian government involvement in the cyber intrusions in the state voter files.\n\u2022 The Director of National Intelligence\u2019s declassified report in January 2017 found that \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election\u201d that relied on \u201cthird-party intermediaries and paid social media users or \u2018trolls.\u2019\u201d\n\u2022 The Senate Intelligence Committee probe launched in January 2017 found that \u201cin addition to the cyber activity directed at state election infrastructure, Russia undertook a wide variety of intelligence-related activities targeting the U.S. voting process. These activities began at least as early as 2014, continued through Election Day 2016, and included traditional information gathering efforts as well as operations likely aimed at preparing to discredit the integrity of the U.S. voting process and election results.\u201d\n\u2022 The House Intelligence Committee probe in January 2017 found that: \u201cRussia conducted cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions in 2015-2016. Russian-state actors and third-party intermediaries were responsible the dissemination of documents and communications stolen from U.S. political organizations. Russian intelligence leveraged social media in an attempt to sow social discord and undermine the U.S. electoral process.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
