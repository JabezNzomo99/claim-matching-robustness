The image was frequently shared with the claim that the pictured creature was a \u201cMadagascar Southeast African monkey:\u201d\n\nThis photograph, however, does not capture an unusual primate from Madagascar. Instead, it depicts a doll from the \u201cInari Foxes\u201d collection produced by the Santani Workshop in Russia. The group\u2019s page features several related images, including the one displayed above, of mythical creatures made of \u201cdifferent types of doll plastic like fimo, cernit, sculpey, sonet:\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that a doll has fooled the internet. In December 2014, a photograph of a pair of cute (but fake) owlets also went viral on social media.", "lang": "en"}
