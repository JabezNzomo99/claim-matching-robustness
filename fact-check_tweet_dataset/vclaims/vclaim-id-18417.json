In the post, it is also claimed that U.P. state Chief Minister Adityanath has purportedly countered Abdullah\u2019s statements by threatening that he would end \u2018Haj Yatra\u2019 if anything happens even to a single Amarnath Yatra pilgrim. Let\u2019s try to verify the authenticity of the claims made in the post.\n\nWhen googled to check if Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s National Conference Party leader Omar Abdullah has made such comments, no results were found. If he had really made such statements, owing to their sensitivity, they would have been reported by all the major newspapers and channels in India. Article 35A empowers the Jammu & Kashmir state\u2019s legislature to define who the \u201cpermanent residents\u201d of the state are, and grant those residents special rights and privileges \u2014 especially with respect to employment, acquisition of property and the right to scholarships and other forms of government aid. Omar Abdullah on various occasions had defended the continuation of the existing Article 35A in Jammu & Kashmir but has never threatened to end \u2018Amarnath Yatra\u2019 if the Government of India repeals it. So, those statements posted on Facebook have no relevance to Omar Abdullah.\n\nWhen \u2018SM Hoax slayer\u2019 fact-checker has approached Omar Abdullah in this regard, he has told them \u2013 \u201cNever said it. It\u2019s a total lie. Show me a clip of me saying anything like what I\u2019m being accused of saying.\u201d\n\nOmar Abdullah has also tweeted that he hadn\u2019t threatened any such thing.\n\nDuring the verification process, it was found that such comments attributed to Omar Abdullah are doing the rounds on social media since 2017.\n\nTo sum it up, Omar Abdullah hasn\u2019t threatened to end \u2018Amarnath Yatra\u2019 if the Government of India repeals Article 35A.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
