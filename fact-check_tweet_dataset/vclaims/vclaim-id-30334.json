Indira Gandhi enters JNU with Delhi Police and beats CPI leader, Sitaram Yechuri who was at that time president of the JNU students union, and forces him to resign and read apology letter for protesting against emergency. This is called Iron Hand dealing with communists. Amit Shah looks saint in front of her\u2019. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post \n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of Sitaram Yechury resigning and reading an apology letter in front of Indira Gandhi for protesting against emergency. Fact: Sitaram Yechury was not resigning and reading an apology letter in the photo. He was reading a memorandum demanding the resignation of Indira Gandhi as the Chancellor of JNU. Also, the photo was not taken at JNU, but at Indira Gandhi\u2019s residence. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the comments section of the post, a user has posted the link of an \u2018edex Live\u2019 article. The article had the same photo with the following narrative \u2013 \u2018It was during those dark days, that Communist Party of India leader, Sitaram Yechury, then the President of the JNU Students\u2019 Union led a student march to the then PM Indira Gandhi\u2019s house and while he stood next to her, he read out the reasons why she should step down as the University\u2019s Chancellor. And she stepped down\u2019. The photo can be also found in a \u2018Hindustan Times\u2019 article with the following description \u2013 \u2018Sitaram Yechury as a student leader in JNU reading the memorandum presented by students on Sept 5, 1977, to Indira Gandhi demanding her resignation as chancellor of the university\u2019. More details about the incident can be found here.\n\nA similar image with the actual version of events is available on social media for some time now and can be found here.\n\nTo sum it up, the photo of Sitaram Yechury demanding Indira\u2019s resignation as the JNU Chancellor is being shared with a false narrative.\n\nUpdate: This picture was not taken during the emergency, but was clicked after the emergency, i.e. in September 1977, and after Indira Gandhi\u2019s defeat in 1977 elections. The emergency was declared in June 1975 & officially ended in March 1977.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
