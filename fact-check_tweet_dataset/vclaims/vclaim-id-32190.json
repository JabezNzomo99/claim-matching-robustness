Rod Blagojevich, among others, The New York Times reported.\n\nPardons remove all legal consequences of criminal convictions, whereas commutations totally or partially reduce an individual\u2019s sentence while leaving the conviction intact, according to the DOJ.\n\nComparisons between the president\u2019s pardoning record and Obama\u2019s started circulating online shortly after Trump\u2019s most recent clemency blitz. The Liberal Privilege USA page alleged Obama pardoned 1,927 people, whereas Trump only pardoned 26, commenting, \u201cAnd Trump is abusing that power?\u201d\n\nBut clemency statistics compiled by the DOJ show those figures are inaccurate. (RELATED: Viral Instagram Post Claims MLK Didn\u2019t Die From A Gunshot)\n\nThe post likely got its figure for Obama from his total 1,927 grants of clemency. That number includes 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations, including 330 that he granted on his last day in office, per the DOJ. Obama has granted more clemency than any other president since Harry Truman, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\n\n\n Meanwhile, Trump has granted clemency to 35 individuals to date. Those clemencies include 25 pardons and 10 commutations, according to DOJ clemency statistics. (It is important to note, however, that the post\u2019s comparison of the two presidents\u2019 records isn\u2019t \u201capples-to-apples,\u201d as the figures cover Obama\u2019s two terms of office and the first roughly three years of Trump\u2019s presidential term, respectively.)\n\nThe White House has assembled a team of advisers to recommend and vet candidates for future pardons and commutations, the Washington Post reported.", "lang": "en"}
