Joaquin Castro questioned the decision while making a \"sewer\" claim about the group\u2019s director.\n\nCastro, D-San Antonio, said in an August 2016 tweet: \"The group's director believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system. Is it really most qualified for the grant?\"\n\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes AIDS, is mainly spread through sexual contact or from sharing needles, syringes, rinse water or other equipment with someone who has the virus, according to a federal website focused on AIDS. Less commonly, per the site, the virus may be spread from mother to child during pregnancy, by being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle and, in rare cases, via blood transfusions and eating food pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person.\n\nWe spotted no mention of the virus getting conveyed from anything in a sewer pipe. \"HIV does not survive long outside the human body (such as on surfaces) and it cannot reproduce outside a human host,\" the site says. The virus also isn\u2019t spread by air or water, the site says.\n\nSeeking Castro\u2019s factual backup, we heard from his House spokeswoman, Erin Hatch, who emailed us web links to summer 2016 news stories--including an Austin American-Statesman story posted earlier the day of Castro\u2019s tweet about Carol Everett, chief executive of the Round Rock-based Heidi Group, which once ran no-charge crisis pregnancy centers in Dallas advising women with unplanned pregnancies about giving birth. Everett, the story said, \"recently came under scrutiny for suggesting during a fetal tissue disposal hearing that sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, could be transmitted through the sewer system.\"\n\nEverett told the paper, though, that her highlighted comments had been misunderstood.\n\nEverett also told reporter Julie Chang that her remarks about HIV amounted to \"a stupid mistake.\" Chang shared with us her notes from her interview with Everett, who said: \"I very much regret what I said. I shouldn\u2019t have even tried\u2026 because they misunderstood it. I didn\u2019t talk about transmitting STDs that way. I was trying to talk about the fact that babies are ground up and put into these garbage disposals which goes into our sewers. I didn\u2019t make that point very clearly.\"\n\nExisting regulations allow fetal remains, as with other medical tissue, to be ground and discharged into a sewer system, incinerated or disinfected followed by disposal in a landfill, or \"an approved alternate treatment process, provided that the process renders the item as unrecognizable, followed by deposition in a sanitary landfill.\"\n\nFor our part, we confirmed from a TV news report noted by Hatch and Chang\u2019s recording of Everett\u2019s comments before a state agency that she indeed made mention of HIV and sewers while advocating for state officials to adopt a rule requiring fetal remains to be buried or cremated rather than disposed other ways. The rule was proposed in June 2016 by the executive commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission on behalf of the Department of State Health Services; it wasn\u2019t finalized as of Aug. 17, 2016.\n\nChang\u2019s recording of Everett\u2019s comments at an Aug. 4, 2016 state hearing on the proposed rule show Everett expressed criticism of current disposal methods, further saying:\n\n\"What does this really do to the public? There are other people to consider.\n\n\"What if one of those sewer treatment programs breaks down one day? You know, the abortion industry doesn\u2019t have time; they only see a woman one time; they do not do an AIDS test, they don\u2019t do, they don\u2019t know if she\u2019s HIV-positive. They don\u2019t know if she has a sexually transmitted disease. And what if one day, just one day, something horrible escaped into the sewer system?\" (Laughter.)\n\n\"It may sound funny but it\u2019s something we could think about because I can tell you today, the public is thinking about it.\n\n\"So I appreciate very much addressing this. I encourage you to uphold it. Let\u2019s take care of those who cannot take care of themselves -- and I am talking about the women.\"\n\nEarlier, as pointed out by Hatch, Everett said in an interview with Austin\u2019s Fox 7 aired July 7, 2016, that existing protocols for disposing fetal remains pose \"several health concerns. What if the woman had HIV? What if she had a sexually transmitted disease? What if those germs went through and got into our water supply?\" Everett said.\n\nWhen we reached Everett about Castro's claim, she said by phone she hadn\u2019t explicitly said HIV is spread through sewer pipes--and doesn\u2019t believe as much. \"People with HIV and AIDS go to the bathroom every day,\" Everett said.\n\nAt the state hearing, she said, she was trying to stress that fetal material gets into the sewer system. Everett called her comment to Austin\u2019s Fox 7 about HIV/STD \"germs\" getting into \"our\" water supply \"really far out. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\"\n\nCastro said Everett \"believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system.\"\n\nEverett didn\u2019t explicitly say as much and told us she doesn\u2019t believe it. However, on two occasions, she raised the \"what-if\" spectre of a woman somehow passing along the virus or an STD through fetal material flushed down a drain.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
