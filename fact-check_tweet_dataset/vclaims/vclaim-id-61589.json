But verifying information about Iran\u2019s nuclear program is a challenge at present, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, conservative pundit Liz Cheney said on Fox News Sunday .\n\n\"The IAEA last month said the Iranians are not currently living up to their obligations,\" said Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, referring to the question of verification.\n\nWe weren\u2019t able to get in touch with Cheney. But the IAEA pointed us to a February regarding Iran\u2019s implementation of the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty . The agency is in charge of inspecting Iran and other countries\u2019 nuclear programs and answers to the United Nations.\n\nThe IAEA found, in sum, that it could not affirm that Iran was fully complying with the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty because Iran did not provide enough information for the agency to clarify outstanding questions.\n\n\"The Agency is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities,\" the report said.\n\nIn March 10 remarks to the IAEA Board of Governors, Director General Yukiya Amano . The IAEA is able to verify that while all of Iran\u2019s declared nuclear material and activities are peaceful and in accordance with their safeguard agreements, they are not able to make the same assurances about undeclared material and activities.\n\n\"The Agency remains concerned about the possible existence in Iran of undisclosed nuclear related activities involving military related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile,\" the report said.\n\nIran is expected to comply with the agency\u2019s expectations because it is an IAEA , said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based group that aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.\n\nBecause Iran has in some cases stonewalled the IAEA -- preventing them from verifying whether Iran\u2019s past and present nuclear programs are entirely peaceful -- the agency has felt for years that Iran has not \"lived up to its obligations,\" Albright said.\n\nIran has dodged IAEA questions about past work on nuclear weapons for at least three years, to the New York Times. Specific outstanding issues the IAEA has with Iran questions about a missile initiator system and neutron calculations.\n\nIran\u2019s IAEA envoy told Iranian media that the agency\u2019s claims were baseless, according to .\n\nIn addition, Iran has simply never accepted some of the United Nations resolutions that required them to suspend uranium enrichment and other activities, meaning they haven\u2019t lived up to some of their other obligations, said Matthew Bunn, professor and nuclear weapons expert at Harvard University.\n\nThe IAEA\u2019s February report is not related to the interim nuclear agreement (Joint Plan of Action) between the United States, Iran and the five other world powers reached in 2013.\n\nIn December, that the has reported no violations with the . (Though Iran did take some actions that certainly cut near the boundaries of the terms of the agreement.)\n\nAdditionally, found in November that the interim deal curtailed Iran\u2019s ability to advance its nuclear program, for the first time in about a decade.\n\nThe interim deal is fairly limited in scope and doesn\u2019t as much address the problem of Iran not giving IAEA enough access to sites and information, Albright said. If the countries reach a nuclear deal in the coming weeks, it\u2019s likely that it will involve Iran giving the IAEA unfettered access, he added.\n\nWhile Cheney\u2019s statement is correct in terms of verifying information about undisclosed past activities, it ignores the context that Iran is complying with the latest agreement, said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran and energy expert at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"By avoiding the specific dimension of the IAEA criticism, Cheney\u2019s statement is somewhat misleading,\" Maloney said.\n\nBunn agreed that the statement might \"carry false implications\" because many who hear Cheney\u2019s claim are likely to think she is referring to the interim deal.\n\nCheney said, \"The IAEA last month said the Iranians are not currently living up to their obligations.\"\n\nThe IAEA published a report a month ago that said Iran wasn\u2019t giving the agency the level of access and information required to verify that all nuclear activity in Iran is peaceful -- a violation of their obligations as signatories of the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty.\n\nThat is separate and distinct from the interim Joint Plan of Action deal between the United States and Iran. The IAEA has found Iran is keeping up with its obligations in that regard.\n\nGiven the context of Cheney\u2019s comments, people could assume she was talking about the Joint Plan of Action. Because that clarification is needed, we rate her statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
