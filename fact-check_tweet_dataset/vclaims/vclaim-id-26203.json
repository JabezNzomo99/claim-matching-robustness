They are beating a father in front of his innocent child. This message should be sent to other groups so that the administration wakes up.)\u201d\n\nFacebook user Shivanker Negi posted a video of policemen engaged in a scuffle with a woman where one of the cops manhandles her. It is being claimed that after the implementation of the amended Motor Vehicle Act that significantly hiked fines, the police is beating a father in presence of his child. The video has been viewed more than 93 lakh times and shared close to 1.7 lakh times.\n\nThe video is also viral on Facebook with the accompanying text claiming that a father was beaten in front of his daughter and that the cops also raised their hands on the woman.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nA close look at the video reveals that the word \u2018Ghaziabad\u2019 is imprinted on a police vehicle.\n\nA keyword search on Google threw up an October 19 report by NDTVon the same incident. According to the media outlet, the police were trying to arrest a man and take him to the police station. The man\u2019s refusal to get inside the police van led to an altercation. The woman intervened and was pushed by a cop.\n\nNDTV also quoted Manish Kumar Mishra, Superintendent of Police, Ghaziabad city as saying, \u201cThis video was getting viral since yesterday. It has been found to be from the Turab Nagar area of Ghaziabad.\u201d\n\nOn October 18, Ghaziabad police issued a press note expressing regret over the mistreatment of the woman and also stated that action has been taking against the faulting cop Raveer Singh.\n\nA video of police excess in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh was falsely linked to hefty fines charged as per the amended Motor Vehicle Act. Furthermore, the woman in the clip is the man\u2019s wife and not his daughter.", "lang": "en"}
