It was a fake passage invented by Francois Gautier. Though a fabrication, it was harmless and a good example of how people fall for even the most ridiculous fake news. Now here is something more delusional and sinister from the same stable.\n\nOn May 28th, a e-rickshaw driver in Delhi was brutally beaten up by a group of students for opposing public urination. The driver, Ravinder, died on his way to the hospital. It was a shocking incident that was widely condemned. Union Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu assured his personal intervention in the matter and took to Twitter to express himself, \u201cSad that an e rickshaw driver was beaten to death for stopping 2 people from urinating in public in Delhi. He was promoting #SwachhBharat\u201d. He also tweeted that he \u201cSpoke to police commissioner & asked him to take strongest action possible against the culprits.\u201d and that he \u201cAsked Municipal Commissioner, North West Delhi to provide job to Ravindra\u2019s wife as per the rules. He promised to give a temporary job.\u201d A compensation was announced for the victim and in a rare gesture, Prime Minister Modi also condemned the incident. A day later two arrests were made. Investigations continue.\n\nIt was indeed a tragedy. For some, it presented an opportunity to be milked. Remember, the name of the driver was Ravinder and the name of the culprits were not known at that time. A rumour soon started floating on social media that the students who beat Ravinder were Muslims.\n\nFrancois Gautier, of the Nostradamus fame took this as an opportunity to peddle the news on his Facebook page with the hashtags #nocountryforpoorhindus #antihindumedia. Here is an extract from his original Facebook post:\n\nGautier went on to say the Ravinder was \u201cnot a calf stealing criminal like Akhlaq but a poor Hindu man trying to be a good citizen\u201d and how his death won\u2019t get any attention because he was a Hindu.\n\nThe twist in the tale came when the name of the arrested culprit was announced by the police as \u201cShekhar Kapasia\u201d from Muzzafarnagar. The images that Gautier had conjured up of crazed mob of Muslims hunting for kaffirs came crashing down. He quietly edited his FB post removing the words, \u201cpeacefuls\u201d, \u201ckaffirs\u201d, etc. Forget an apology or word of regret, there was not even a mention of his previous post.\n\nHere is a screenshot highlighting the words removed from his edited post..\n\nTo understand the issue better, please watch the following video as to how Francois Gautier revised his post after it became apparent that the accused was not Muslim.\n\nGautier was not alone in his attempt of communalising and rumour mongering over this unfortunate incident. On similar lines on Twitter, a user, @goyalsanjeev used the incident to attack Arvind Kejriwal and at the same time also suggest that the perpetrators behind the attack are Muslims.\n\nAn anonymous handle with 30K+ followers, that goes by the name of @SickularLibtard was also one of the early ones on Twitter to speak of \u201c2 Muslims, kill 1 Hindu, Delhi.\u201d\n\nThis was followed by Praveen Bajpai, a BJP Karyakarta, \u201cblessed\u201d to be followed by PM Modi on Twitter, who even managed to find two Muslim names for the culprits.\n\nAfter the name of the culprit emerged, those on Twitter who spread the fake story have also gone quiet. There is no retraction, no regret, whatsoever. They will move on to the opportunity to polarise, knowing very well that this too will be forgotten.\n\nWatch out for such malicious fake news that is now routinely being spread to polarise and spread feelings of hatred between communities. Each instance of such fake news needs to be countered to ensure that divisive forces don\u2019t succeed with their sinister agenda.", "lang": "en"}
