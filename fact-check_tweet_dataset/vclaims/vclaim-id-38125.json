On Sunday, Trump slammed California Governor Gavin Newsom for his handling of the wildfires and vaguely warned that he would end the federal funding. Newsom declared a statewide emergency last week in an effort to mobilize resources. \u201cEvery year, as the fire\u2019s rage & California burns, it is the same thing\u2014and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don\u2019t see close to the level of burn in other states,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter\u2026 The president\u2019s remarks about California\u2019s governor come after he offered last summer to help Russia fight a similar battle against wildfires. According to the Kremlin, Trump made the offer to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a phone call in early August. At the time, the wildfires were so large that Greenpeace Russia said they were creating an \u201cecological catastrophe.\u201d Putin reportedly expressed his \u201csincere gratitude\u201d to Trump for the offer and said that if necessary he would take him up on it.\n\nWhat Trump said about California\n\nTrump has a history of publicly criticizing officials in California (in particular Democrats such as Gov. Gavin Newsom) and attributing wildfires in the state to purportedly bad \u201cforest management.\u201d He has repeatedly threatened to withdraw federal emergency assistance for the state, including in November 2018, when he tweeted \u201cBillions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more [federal] payments!\u201d\n\nTwo months later, he declared on Twitter: \u201cBillions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 3, as the 2019 California wildfire season developed, Trump criticized Newsom in a series of tweets that read:\n\n\u201cThe Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met that he must \u2018clean\u2019 his forest floors regardless of what his bosses, the environmentalists, DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers\u2026Every year, as the fire\u2019s [sic] rage & California burns, it is the same thing \u2014 and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don\u2019t see close to the level of burn in other states\u2026But our teams are working well together in\u2026putting these massive, and many, fires out. Great firefighters! Also, open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North. Don\u2019t pour it out into the Pacific Ocean. Should be done immediately. California desperately needs water, and you can have it now! [Emphasis added].\u201d\n\nIn those tweets, Trump clearly indicated that continued federal financial assistance to California (specifically to Newsom) would be contingent upon state officials changing their approach to forest management. That constituted a threat to withdraw federal aid to California for wildfires, and Newsweek was right to describe it as such.\n\nWhat Trump said about Russia\n\nIn August 2019, the Russian government published a statement about a phone call between Trump and Putin on July 31. That statement read as follows:\n\n\u201cVladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with US President Donald Trump this evening at the American side\u2019s initiative. The US President offered help in putting out wildfires in Siberia. The President of Russia expressed sincere gratitude for the kind attention and the offer of help and assistance. Vladimir Putin said he will accept the offer if it becomes necessary. He also told his American colleague that a powerful group of aircraft had been formed in Siberia to fight the wildfires. According to the Emergencies Ministry, solutions have been found to problems with the refuelling and deployment of airplanes and helicopters.\n\n\u201cThe President of Russia regards the US President\u2019s offer as a sign that it is possible that full-scale bilateral relations will be restored in the future. The presidents of Russia and the United States agreed to continue contacts in the form of telephone conversations as well as personal meetings.\u201d\n\nWe asked the White House whether they could corroborate, even broadly, the Russian government\u2019s characterization of the call. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response.\n\nAt the time, a White House spokesperson did not contradict that version of events and told news outlets that, during his conversation with Putin, Trump had \u201cexpressed concern over the vast wildfires afflicting Siberia.\u201d This characterization, combined with the Russian description of an offer to help, means it\u2019s perfectly plausible that Trump did make such an offer.\n\nWe found confirmation that he did in a video of an Aug. 1 press conference during which Trump said the following when reporters asked him about the phone call:\n\n\u201cMostly we discussed the forest fires in Siberia, and other parts of Russia. And I said, look, we have the greatest equipment, if we could help you let us know. Large sections are burning, and so I said to President Putin, if we can help you, let me know.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
