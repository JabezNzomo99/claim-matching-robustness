The video is from \u2018Fremont Solstice Parade 2017\u2019. The Fremont Solstice Parade is organised to celebrate the longest day of the year.\n\nWe broke the video into frames and reverse searched each frame. The result shows that the video is from \u2018Fremont Solstice Parade\u2019 of 2017.\n\nOne of the tweets we came across, uploaded in December 2018, said that it was the Trump float at the \u2018Fremont Solstice Parade 2017\u2019.\n\nWe searched the keyword \u2018Fremont Solstice Parade 2017\u2019 and found the website Fremont Arts Council. In the website, the council extends an invitation to Americans every year in the month of June to celebrate the longest day of the year.\n\nThe Seattle Post-Intelligencer, an online newspaper and former print newspaper based in Seattle, carried photos from the June 2017 event. We came across a photo of the same float on its website which was credited to Grant Hindsley.\n\nOn further investigation we found an article of 17 June 2017 in the San Francisco Chronicle, an American newspaper titled, \u2018Solstice parade thrills, amuses, titillates in Seattle\u2019. A longer version of the same video is attached to the article and it doesn\u2019t report any protest against Trump. The video shows an atmosphere of festivity and Americans celebrating. Several people are shown to be enjoying the day with creative floats, one of which happens to be that of Trump.", "lang": "en"}
