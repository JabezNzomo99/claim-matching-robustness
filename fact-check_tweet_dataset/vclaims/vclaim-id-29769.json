(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post and others like it are based on actual events related to the death of high-ranking Iranian official Qassem Soleimani due to a U.S. drone strike on Jan. 2. However, many of the posts are misleading because they leave out important context.\n\nReports of an $80 million bounty stem from remarks at Soleimani\u2019s funeral procession in the northeastern city of Mashhad that were aired on Iranian state television. Footage from state TV, including the remarks in the original Farsi, were tweeted by NBC News Tehran correspondent Ali Arouzi.\n\nAt the funeral procession, which was a highly choreographed, state-run event with a national audience, a speaker called on Iranians \"to donate $1 each in order to gather an $80 million bounty on President Trump\u2019s head,\" Arouzi wrote.\n\nThe population of Iran is a little bit over 80 million, so $1 each would be roughly $80 million.\n\nThere\u2019s a caveat, however. The $80 million bounty was a suggestion by a eulogist at the funeral \u2014 not official Iranian government policy.\n\nWe asked Farhad Souzanchi \u2014 a Farsi speaker who founded the Rouhani Meter fact-checking website, which covers Iranian politics \u2014 to review the video clip from the funeral. Souzanchi said that Arouzi\u2019s summary of the speaker\u2019s words was accurate.\n\nSouzanchi said the eulogist prefaced his remarks by saying that \"this is a voluntary suggestion from the people of Mashhad on behalf of all Iranians.\"\n\nWhile the bounty has made a splash on U.S. social media, Souzanchi, who monitors Iranian media, told PolitiFact that the bounty proposal \"hasn't made much news\" in Iran. He said the speaker, whose identity PolitiFact has been unable to confirm, was not familiar to him either.\n\nOther Iran experts urged not taking the bounty threat too seriously.\n\n\"I would not touch it with a 10 foot pole,\" said Mark J. Gasiorowski, a specialist in Iran and the Middle East at Tulane University.\n\nArang Keshavarzian, an associate professor of Middle East studies at New York University, said he agrees with Souzanchi that there\u2019s no indication in the Iranian media that the bounty is becoming a serious policy proposal.\n\nSocial media posts have said Iran has placed a bounty of $80 million on Trump\u2019s head. A eulogist at Soleimani\u2019s funeral made this proposal, but there is no evidence that it is something being seriously considered by the Iranian government\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
