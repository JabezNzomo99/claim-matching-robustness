The bill seeks to treat all statutory rape cases\u2014regardless of what kind of sex they involve\u2014equally.\n\nExamples of these claims can be found here , here , and here .\n\nIntroduced by California state senator Scott Wiener in early August 2020, the bill ( here ) intends to equalize how state law treats cases of statutory rape, regardless of what kind of intercourse\u2014vaginal, oral, or anal, as well as digital penetration\u2014is involved ( here ).\n\nUnder current law, California judges have discretion over registering individuals of certain ages as sex offenders if they have engaged in vaginal intercourse with a minor who is both over the age of 14 and within a 10-year age range here ). (The bill does not apply to anyone under 14 years old, here ).\n\nIn other words, rather than the young adult being an automatically registered as sex offender, the judge may decide. The most extreme example would be a 24-year-old engaging in non-coercive vaginal sex with a 14-year-old. A more common example, in which it would likely be inappropriate to add a person to the registry, would be a 19-year-old and a 17-year-old having vaginal sex.\n\nIf the situations mentioned above involved anal sex, oral sex, or digital penetration \u2013 more typical among the LGBT individuals\u2014a judge would not have discretion over the young adult\u2019s registration as a sex offender. Rather, the registration would be automatic, even in the case of a 19-year-old and a 17-year-old having non-vaginal sex.\n\nSome Facebook posts, like the one here , claim that the bill allows pedophilia \u201cto be considered a sexual orientation in the LGBTQ community.\u201d This is false. SB-145 amends Section 290 of the existing state penal code ( here ) to apply the same standard of judicial discretion to straight people and LGBT people alike. Senator Wiener described SB-145 as \u201can anti-discrimination law\u201d that \u201cends discrimination against LGBTQ people on the sex offender registry.\u201d ( here ).\n\nAs reported here by Mother Jones, \u201cLGBTQ advocates argue the situation unfairly penalizes people who do not engage in penile-vaginal intercourse, a problem that Sen. Wiener\u2019s legislation aims to fix.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mother Jones ( here ), the Sacramento Bee ( here ), and Wiener\u2019s official website ( here ), the state senator has faced online harassment from troll accounts and followers of QAnon, a \u201cbig tent\u201d conspiracy theory community spreading misinformation about topics ranging from alien landings to vaccine safety ( here ), for introducing the reform bill. On Aug. 6, Wiener began a Twitter thread ( here ) sharing some of the violent, homophobic, and antisemitic messages he has consequently received.\n\nFalse. California Senate Bill 145 does not \u201clegalize pedophilia,\u201d nor does it classify pedophilia as a sexual orientation. It extends the same discretion state judges currently have over sex offender registration for certain young adults who have engaged in vaginal sex with certain minors to those who have engaged in non-vaginal sex.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
