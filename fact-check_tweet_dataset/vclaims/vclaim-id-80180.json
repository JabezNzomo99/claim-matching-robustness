The image does not show that ferry, according to an analysis of the photo, and authorities say the picture is a hoax.\n\nThis report on June 26 includes the photo of a boat resting on a sandy floor in murky green water.\n\nAn English translation of the article\u2019s headline is: \u201cThis is the photo!!! The remains of KM Sinar Bangun have been found intact at the bottom of Toba lake.\u201d\n\nKataKita, an Indonesian Facebook group with 930,000 followers, also shared the image in a post announcing that the vessel had been found.\n\nAuthorities announced on June 29 that they had found the vessel, with more than 160 people presumed dead, at the bottom of Lake Toba.\n\nHowever they later said the vessel, and the bodies of the missing passengers believed to be still inside, would not be recovered due to a lack of advanced technology to get to the boat, which was about 420 metres (1,400 feet) below the surface.\n\nThe image purportedly showing the vessel led some to believe the bodies of those missing could be recovered.\n\n\u201cWe must be grateful for the news because it raises hopes for the families of the victims that they'll be able to get the missing bodies,\u201d said one of the more than 100 comments accompanying the KataKita post.\n\nHowever an image of the vessel before it sank that the transport ministry distributed to the media shows distinct differences with the one in the misleading image.\n\nOne difference is the front door on the right hand side of each boat are in different positions. The two images can be inspected in this side-by-side comparison. AFP placed the two images together in Photoshop and cropped them for size but did not otherwise change them.\n\nOther photos of the vessel before it sank available online match the one provided by the transport ministry.\n\nNational Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho also tweeted to his 70,000 followers that the image purportedly showing the sunken ferry was a hoax.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dark, cold and we don\u2019t have the equipment or divers to reach the bottom of the lake,\u201d Sutopo said in the tweet.", "lang": "en"}
