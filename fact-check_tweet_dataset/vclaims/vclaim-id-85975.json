I remember talking with people from our Near East division about a fax that came in from the Swiss ambassador, and I think our general feeling was that he had perhaps added a little bit to it because it wasn\u2019t in consonance with the state of our relations. And we had had some discussions \u2026 particularly through intelligence channels with high-ranking Iranian intelligence people, and nothing that we were seeing in this fax was in consonance with what we were hearing face to face. So we didn\u2019t give it much weight\u2026. If there had been a desire on the Iranian side to seek a better relationship, it would have been an ideal time afterward to send that signal, and we got no such signal to my knowledge.\n\nIn a speech late in 2005, the chief Iranian negotiator appeared to brag that the Iranians had hoodwinked the Europeans, using the talks as a ruse to master key stages in the nuclear fuel process. Thus, he said, Iran was prepared to act when the talks broke down. He said that when the extent of Iran\u2019s nuclear program was first exposed in early 2003, the Americans were at \u201cthe height of their pride and victory in Iraq\u201d and so Iran had seized on any tactic that would delay consideration of the matter at the time at the U.N. Security Council. (For an more positive view, read this account by a former British diplomat involved in the talks at the time.)", "lang": "en"}
