Old Video Of Fire Mishap In Kashmir Being Shared As Army Atrocity\n\nPakistani Facebook page \"Free Indian Occupied Kashmir\" shared an old video of houses ablaze with fire in Kashmir's Uri region. The caption of this video claimed that the Indian Army was responsible for setting the houses of Kashmiris on fire.\n\nUpon investigation, we found that the incident was from May 2018, when several houses were gutted with fire.\n\nNews reports on that incident reveal that the fire started when a man carrying a fire torch went inside the shed to feed the cattle.\n\n2. With Kashmir In Lockdown, Old Videos And Photos Stoke Tensions\n\nA composite of two photos - one showing an injured girl and another showing two distressed girls - were revived by Pakistani journalist and anchor Ameer Abbas.\n\nAbbas alleged in his tweet that the photos show the plight of Kashmiris at the hands of the Indian Army, following the abrogation of Article 370.\n\nOur fact check revealed that neither of the photos were recent or related to Kashmir in anyway.\n\n3. News Outlets Run Old Video Of MS Dhoni Jeered With \u2018Boom Boom Afridi\u2019 Chants In Kashmir\n\nA video showing Mahendra Singh Dhoni being jeered with chants of 'Boom Boom Afridi' in Kashmir became viral as a recent incident, in light of the present situation in the valley.\n\nThis video was shared with similar claims by many internet users, and was even picked up by Indian news outlets like Catch News and Zee 24 Ghanta.\n\nOne of the internet users to share this video out of context was Pakistani sports anchor Mohammed Faizan Najeeb.\n\nUpon inspecting further we found that the video was from 2017, when Dhoni was invited as chief guest for a cricket match sponsored by the Indian Army in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThis time, a prominent member of parliament of Pakistan turned out to be the culprit behind a misleading post.\n\nAli Haider Zaidi, Pakistan's Minister for Maritime Affairs tweeted an old video from the funeral of slain militant Burhan Wani, to falsely claim that it showed millions of Kashmiris protesting against the government's recent decision.\n\nWhile there has been recent protests in Kashmir, this video itself does not highlight any such incidents.\n\nOn August 9, 2019, a video showing men in police uniform firing on protestors became viral on Twitter. The video was shared with claims of atrocities being committed on Kashmiris during the ongoing curfew and lockdown in the valley.\n\nBOOM found that many of the users sharing this video out of context were from Pakistan. The videos were shared with hashtags #EndKashmirBlockade and #KashmirWantsFreedom, which have been trending in Pakistan and India since the current crisis began.\n\nClick here to read our fact check.\n\n6.

The post became viral with claims of atrocities on Kashmiris by the Indian Army.\n\nThe video was shared with similar captions by multiple Pakistani Twitter handles, including that of Abdullah Gul, chairman of Tehrik Jawanan Pakistan/Kashmir, and Omar Ayub Kahn, the Federal Minister For Power, Petroleum & Natural Resources.\n\nHowever, our fact check revealed that the video is from an incident that happened in October 2018, when several civilians were killed in south Kashmir\u2019s Kulgam region due to a stray explosive shell going off at an encounter site.\n\nFollowing Bakri Eid on August 12, 2019, two graphics surfaced on Twitter claiming that the Indian government had banned animal sacrifice in Kashmir. Both of them were attributed to news channel Mirror Now, and was called out as fake by the channel's editor Faye D'Souza.\n\nWhile these graphics were massively shared by Indian internet users, we also spotted several Pakistani handles sharing them.\n\n9. Pak Scribe Shares Old Incident Of Indian Forces Using \u2018Human Shield\u2019 As Recent\n\nAn old video showing Indian security personnel using four Kashmiri men as human shield against stone pelters was revived to falsely portray the present situation in Kashmir.\n\nThe person to share this video was prominent Pakistani journalist, Hamid Mir, who has around 6 million followers on Twitter.

Pakistani Minister Passes Off Old Videos From Haryana, Telangana As Kashmir\n\nAli Haider Zaidi did it again.

Just a day after PTI's official handle misleadingly shared two videos out of context, the party's Lahore wing shared another video, claiming to show \"RSS hooligans evacuating Muslim settlements\" in Kashmir.\n\nThe same video was shared over social with similar misleading captions by many Pakistani users.\n\nUpon investigating, BOOM found out that the video is from an incident that happened in West Bengal in July 2019, and showed a clash between BJP and TMC workers in the region of Cooch Behar.\n\n14.

The tweets claimed that the Indian government was cutting down orchards belonging to Kashmiris.\n\nHowever, we found out the claims around this video showing a recent situation in Kashmir were completely false. The video originated from an incident in July, 2018, from Shimla, Himachal Pradesh.\n\nOn August 31, 2019, Pakistani singer Rabi Pirzada shared a set of unrelated photos on Twitter, showing scenes of animal sacrifice, militant attacks and riots.\n\nThe caption shared with these photos falsely claimed to show a recent genocide of Kashmiris by the Indian Army.\n\nBOOM found out that the images were unrelated to the present situation in Kashmir, and in some cases quite old.", "lang": "en"}
