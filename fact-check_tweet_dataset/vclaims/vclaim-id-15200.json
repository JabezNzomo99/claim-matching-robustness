Far from being a \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201ccontentious\u201d dispute over membership fees, as the president has repeatedly suggested, the correspondence indicates a routine and drama-free departure from the club.\n\nAccording to the report, in the days after Mueller was appointed special counsel on May 17, 2017, Trump complained to advisers that Muller had conflicts of interest. Trump said those included that \u201cMueller had interviewed for the FBI Director position shortly before being appointed as Special Counsel, that he had worked for a law firm that represented people affiliated with the President, and that Mueller had disputed certain fees relating to his membership in a Trump golf course in Northern Virginia,\u201d the report reads.\n\nAccording to the report, the president\u2019s advisers \u2014 including then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, then-White House counsel Don McGahn and Bannon \u2014 \u201cpushed back on his assertion of conflicts, telling the President they did not count as true conflicts.\u201d Bannon told investigators that he \u201crecalled telling the President that the purported conflicts were \u2018ridiculous\u2019 and that none of them was real or could come close to justifying precluding Mueller from serving as Special Counsel.\u201d\n\nOn May 23, 2017, shortly after Mueller was appointed special counsel, Justice Department ethics officials concluded it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for Mueller to lead the investigation even though his former law firm, WilmerHale, had represented Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his daughter, Ivanka Trump; and Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores noted that Mueller himself was not involved in representing Kushner, Manafort or Ivanka Trump. \u201cMr. Mueller is permitted to participate in matters involving his former firm\u2019s clients so long as he has no confidential information about the client and did not participate in the representation,\u201d she said.\n\nNonetheless, the president repeatedly made public claims highlighting his other concerns about Mueller\u2019s purported conflicts. Most recently, Trump made his case for Mueller\u2019s conflicts in a speech at the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference on March 3.\n\nTrump detailed those same accusations during an interview with the Daily Caller last fall.\n\nTrump, Sept. 4, 2018: But I view it [the Mueller investigation] as being illegal for many reasons. Some of which are that, number one there was no crime and number two everybody was conflicted, including Mueller. There were, I mean tremendous conflicts here, you know the conflicts, you\u2019ve heard the conflicts. Daily Caller: Speaking of one which you cited, I\u2019d like to know, you said you interviewed Mueller for FBI director. Trump: Sitting right in that chair. Daily Caller: What did you think during the interview? Trump: I liked him, but I didn\u2019t give him the job? Trump: But I had a business dispute with Mueller before that. I had a real business dispute.\n\nAnd during an interview on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d last summer.\n\nAnd, of course, Trump has repeated the claim on Twitter.\n\nFBI Director James Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, and the administration set out quickly to find his replacement in what turned out to be a very public vetting process.\n\nOn May 12, 2017, Politico reported that four people \u2014 acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, former Justice Department Criminal Division Chief Alice Fisher and former U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Michael Garcia \u2014 were set to be interviewed the next day. \u201cHenry E. Hudson, U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia, Fran Townsend, former Homeland Security Adviser to former President George W. Bush, and Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, were also interviewed,\u201d the story said.\n\nSimilarly, the Washington Post and Bloomberg each named eight people who were interviewed on May 14, 2017. PBS listed 14 possible candidates for the job.\n\nBut there was no media mention of Mueller at that time.\n\nBut according to Trump, after he fired Comey, Mueller came to him to interview for the director\u2019s position \u2014 a job that Mueller held for 12 years until he retired in 2013 \u2014 but Trump says he turned him down. According to Trump, Mueller \u201cwanted the job \u2026 and I didn\u2019t give it to him.\u201d\n\nThat narrative was echoed by an unnamed White House official in June of 2017, as reported by CNN and others.\n\nIn an interview on June 15, 2017, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about the meeting between Trump and Mueller. She said it was her understanding that it was a job interview on the day before Mueller was named as special counsel, though she wasn\u2019t aware of whether it was for acting or permanent FBI director. Sanders did not answer the question about why the administration hadn\u2019t mentioned him as a possible candidate, as it did with others.\n\nBannon, however, has a different recollection of events.\n\nIn an interview with investigators, \u201cBannon recalled that the White House had invited Mueller to speak to the President to offer a perspective on the institution of the FBI. Bannon said that, although the White House thought about beseeching Mueller to become Director again, he did not come in looking for the job.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Bannon says Mueller did not come to the White House for a job interview. And it was the White House, not Mueller, that was considering wooing Mueller into taking the job.\n\nWe reached out to Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, for more details about what actually took place at the meeting, whether it was an interview, and whether Mueller was seeking the director job. \u201cWe\u2019ll decline comment beyond the report,\u201d Carr said.\n\nTrump also claimed that Mueller had a conflict because the two men had a \u201cvery nasty & contentious business relationship\u201d regarding Mueller\u2019s membership fees at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia. Through a spokesman, Mueller has denied that there was a dispute.\n\n\u201cMr. Mueller left the club in October 2011 without dispute,\u201d special counsel spokesman Joshua Stueve told DailyMail.com in July 2017.\n\nMueller\u2019s report provides some details on how and why Mueller left the club \u2014 but none of it suggests that the two men had a \u201cvery nasty & contentious business relationship.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, Mueller informed the club in a letter on Oct. 12, 2011, that he would no longer be a member. The letter \u201cnoted that \u2018we live in the District and find that we are unable to make full use of the Club\u2019 and that inquired \u2018whether we would be entitled to a refund of a portion of our initial membership fee,\u2019 which was paid in 1994,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cAbout two weeks later, the controller of the club responded that the Muellers\u2019 resignation would be effective October 31, 2011, and that they would be \u2018placed on a waitlist to be refunded on a first resigned/first refunded basis\u2019 in accordance with the club\u2019s legal documents,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe Muellers have not had further contact with the club.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
