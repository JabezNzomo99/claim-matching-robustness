This claim is outdated.\n\nFacebook posts using #SavetheChildren were reportedly banned or censored from Aug. 5, 2020, until the early morning of the next day. Publications and users reported that statuses could still be shared, but posts that had used the hashtag did not show results. Instead, they returned a warning that the post violated community standards.\n\nIn an email to Snopes, Facebook confirmed that the hashtag had been temporarily disabled.\n\n\u201cWe temporarily blocked the hashtag as it was surfacing low-quality content,\u201d wrote Dami Oyefeso, a Facebook spokesperson. \u201cThe hashtag has since been restored, and we will continue to monitor for content that violates our Community Standards.\u201d\n\nA Snopes search on both the mobile and desktop versions of Facebook revealed that the hashtag had been reinstated as of this publication. Search results included a variety of disinformation and misrepresented facts and events surrounding pedophilia rings, as well as potentially triggering images of children being abused, exploited, or presented in situations that suggest sexual exploitation.\n\nSocial media users speculated that the temporary disabling of the hashtag was because many of the images associated with #SavetheChildren violated Facebook community standards, which have a specific rationale for any content related to minors that include \u201cimagery that depicts non-sexual child abuse regardless of sharing intent.\u201d\n\nSome believe that some social media users have abused the hashtag as a way to spread anti-mask sentiment in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of social media influencers have argued that children wearing masks may be at a heightened risk of abduction or less likely to be spotted after having been kidnapped. Others have connected mask mandates to the \u201cglobal elite and their fetish for children.\u201d\n\nSave the Children is a humanitarian organization that provides education and social services to children around the world. Bill and Melinda Gates donated to the organization and conspiracy theorists and tabloids have connected Bill Gates with convicted sex offender and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.", "lang": "en"}
