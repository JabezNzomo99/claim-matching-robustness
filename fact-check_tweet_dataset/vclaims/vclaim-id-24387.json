Oh, we forgot to tell you that he is a Dalit. May God grant such husbands to the daughters of everyone who thinks he is an innocent man. Warning: Only for 18+ persons. Watch it with headphones on. Sisters and daughters, please stay away'.\n\nAs the video contains abusive language, viewers' discretion is advised.\n\nThe 3-minute-long video shows the man giving choicest abuses to the police officials standing around him.\n\nThe man can be heard saying he is district president of the Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha and also claims to be an aide of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.\n\nYou can view the post here and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on a screenshot of the video and found the same image on a blog post. Here, the name of the man in the video was stated as Vaibhav Gangwar.\n\nWe then searched with the keywords 'Vaibhav Gangwar Bareilly' and found the same video uploaded on YouTube on September 3, 2018.\n\nGangwar was booked by the Bareilly police under a land dispute earlier and later he had created a ruckus at the police station.
