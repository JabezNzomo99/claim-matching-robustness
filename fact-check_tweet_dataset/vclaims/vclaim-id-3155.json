But the GOP\u2019s evidence is flimsy and misleading.\n\nBoth ads fault Lamb, a former federal prosecutor, for negotiating guilty pleas in return for sentences that were less than the maximum punishment that might have been imposed upon conviction on all charges. That\u2019s like criticizing him for doing his job \u2014 97 percent of all federal criminal cases that were settled by trial or plea ended in guilty pleas in 2014, according to the most recent figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nBoth ads from the National Republican Congressional Committee go after Lamb for his handling of the sex-scandal case of Marine Maj. Mark A. Thompson, who isn\u2019t named in the ads but is described only as \u201ca Navy professor \u2026 accused of sexual assault\u201d and as \u201ca teacher who lied about his sexual misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe ads say Lamb struck a plea bargain that allowed Thompson to \u201ckeep his taxpayer-funded retirement benefits.\u201d But the fact is, Lamb recommended a stiffer sentence than the military court awarded, and the amount of Thompson\u2019s military pension is still under review by the secretary of the Navy, who may reduce it substantially.\n\nThe second NRCC ad also accuses Lamb of other lenient \u201cplea deals.\u201d It says he allowed a \u201cdrug kingpin\u201d to receive \u201ca lighter sentence\u201d and also allowed \u201cmultiple offenders\u201d who illegally helped criminals get guns to avoid jail time. \u201cConor Lamb Can\u2019t Be Trusted,\u201d the ad asserts in a graphic.\n\nBut those claims also mislead.\n\nAs an assistant U.S. attorney, Lamb put away the \u201cdrug kingpin\u201d for a decade. Andre Saunders, now 37, is currently serving a 10-year sentence in a minimum-security federal correctional facility in Morgantown, West Virginia, and isn\u2019t scheduled for release until 2024. Furthermore, as part of the plea arrangement, Saunders forfeited to the government his home in Uniontown, $271,894.53 from the sale of a second home in Uniontown, a 2008 BMW automobile, plus $325,120 in cash, five luxury watches, a diamond necklace, a 9 mm Baretta pistol and a $100,000 judgment.\n\nIs that a \u201clighter\u201d sentence, as the ad vaguely claims? Lighter than what?\n\nIt\u2019s true Saunders had a prior drug-trafficking conviction, and in theory could have received a life sentence \u2014 if convicted on all 270 counts with which he was originally charged. But juries are unpredictable, and it\u2019s also possible that Saunders might have walked free after a lengthy and expensive trial.\n\nAs for the claim that \u201cmultiple\u201d offenders went free in a gunrunning case, the fact is that only three of the eight who were charged got probation and avoided prison \u2014 one of whom also was sentenced to serve six months in a halfway house, according to federal court records. All pleaded guilty to making false statements to buy guns.\n\nThe ringleader in the case was Michael Bassier, who paid these and other \u201cstraw buyers\u201d to buy guns in Pennsylvania which he then smuggled into New York City to be sold illegally on the street. Lamb secured a 10-year prison sentence for Bassier, which is running concurrently with a 17-year sentence he was already serving on state gun-sale charges in New York.\n\nFour others also received prison sentences: Nathan Lawrence, six years; Brandon Goode, five years and five months; Mychael Scott, five years; and Brandon Williams, two years and six months.\n\nWhat the ads say about the case of Maj. Thompson is factually accurate, up to a point. But there\u2019s much more to the story.\n\nThompson wasn\u2019t only a \u201cprofessor\u201d and \u201cteacher.\u201d He is a combat veteran who served both in Iraq and Afghanistan before teaching history to midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy. Furthermore, the ads feature the phrase \u201caccused of raping\u201d in the graphics, but the 2013 court martial acquitted Thompson of that charge long before Lamb got the case.\n\nThat 2013 military court convicted Thompson on lesser charges of inappropriate sexual relationships, but the \u201cmultiple female service members\u201d mentioned in the ad number only two. One was at the time a 23-year-old senior who admitted to a long and consensual affair. The other was her 21-year-old friend and classmate.\n\nBoth took part in heavy drinking and strip poker at Thompson\u2019s house, and the 21-year-old accuser later testified she was too drunk to consent to sex, or remember how she ended up naked. Thompson was sentenced to two months in the brig, and fined $60,000 on that conviction.\n\nLamb got the case years later. Thompson, meanwhile, had convinced a three-member Marine Corps board of inquiry that he should remain in the Marines, and furthermore shouldn\u2019t have been convicted of anything in the first place. But then a Washington Post expose turned up new evidence showing Thompson had lied to the board of inquiry.\n\nThe Navy reopened the case, and brought new charges. On April 13, 2017 \u2014 with Lamb as a reservist serving as a military prosecutor \u2014 Thompson confessed in court to sexual misbehavior and to lying about it to the board of inquiry. He pleaded guilty to charges of making false official statements and of \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.\u201d\n\nLamb recommended that Thompson serve 18 months in confinement and be dismissed from the Marine Corps. But an official Marine Corps summary shows Thompson instead drew only 90 days in the brig, and his dismissal from the Marines was suspended as part of the plea agreement. The court\u2019s convening authority, Marine Lt. Col. Christopher Greer, said Thompson\u2019s \u201crequest to retire\u201d would be reviewed by the secretary of the Navy, who could decide to reduce Thompson\u2019s pension to that of a first lieutenant, \u201cwhich I believe was the last grade served honorably.\u201d\n\nThompson was taken from the court in handcuffs, and served his full 90-day sentence at the Camp Lejeune Brig in North Carolina, according to Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Brian T. Block. He said Thompson was released June 27, but the matter of his retirement is still under review. \u201cThe Secretary of the Navy will make a final determination on the retirement grade of Major Thompson,\u201d Block told FactCheck.org.\n\nLamb is running in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, against GOP nominee Rick Saccone. The seat is vacant because Republican Rep. Tim Murphy resigned Oct. 5 after it was reported that he encouraged a woman with whom he had a sexual affair to get an abortion. The race is currently rated as a \u201ctoss up\u201d by the Cook Political Report, even though President Trump carried the district by 20 points in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
