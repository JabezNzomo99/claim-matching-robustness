The claim is misleading; sharia is not part of law in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe article by Russia\u2019s pro-Kremlin RT website has been shared thousands of times since it was published in 2014. It has resurfaced on Facebook in recent weeks, racking up more than 4,000 shares since January 28, 2020 in Australia, Canada, India, Nigeria, the UK, and elsewhere. We\u2019ve archived some recent shares of the article here, here and here.\n\nMany comments on the posts expressed anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\n\u201cSharia principles are to become enshrined in the UK legal system for the first time,\u201d the article claims.\n\nIt says that solicitors \u201cwill be able to write Islamic wills which will have the power to exclude non-believers completely and deny women an equal share of an inheritance\u201d, as well as amending standard clauses in a will in order to exclude adopted or illegitimate children.\n\nSolicitors have also been told that \u201cmale heirs in most cases receive double the amount inherited by a female heir of the same class\u201d and that \u201cnon-Muslims may not inherit at all\u201d, RT reports.\n\nRT\u2019s article cites a document known as a practice note published in March 2014 by the Law Society, a body which represents solicitors in England and Wales.\n\nThe Law Society issues practice notes to advise solicitors on the application of the law, although solicitors are not required to follow this advice. The organisation has since deleted its advice on sharia succession rules from its website, but you can find an archived version here.\n\nNo change in the law\n\nRT\u2019s article is misleading; the advice the Law Society issued to lawyers on writing wills for Muslim clients did not amount to a change in the law.\n\nWhile some elements were indeed taken from the Law Society\u2019s report, the story\u2019s headline and first paragraph led readers to believe that sharia would become enshrined in UK legislation.\n\nThe Law Society tried to set the record straight on Twitter in March 2014.\n\nBritain\u2019s The Telegraph and The Independent also reported on the Law Society\u2019s advice at the time. Media reports prompted then-justice secretary Chris Grayling to clarify that shariah law had \u201cno jurisdiction in England and Wales\u201d.\n\nMashood Baderin, professor of laws at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), said the Law Society\u2019s advice to solicitors was completely legal in accordance with UK law.\n\n\u201cSharia law does not apply in the UK,\u201d he told AFP on February 11, 2020.\n\nHe said that solicitors had the right to amend or remove standard will clauses for Muslim clients, such as excluding adopted or illegitimate children from inheritance.\n\n\u201cThere are standard rules on how to make a will, but these are templates. There\u2019s no law that says you can\u2019t change the template\u201d, he said. \u201cYou can give your inheritance to anyone. You can give your inheritance to a dog\u201d.\n\nWhile sharia councils exist in the UK, they have no legal power. According to a study on sharia law commissioned by the British government and published in 2018, sharia councils are voluntary local groups of scholars who offer advice to Muslims, usually concerning religious marriage and divorce.\n\nAFP reported on misleading Facebook posts in January 2020 that claimed that the US state of North Carolina had banned sharia law.", "lang": "en"}
