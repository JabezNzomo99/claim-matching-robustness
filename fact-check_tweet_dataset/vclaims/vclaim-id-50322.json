The posts claim the volcano eruption helps to explain why the Philippines is \u201cnot that much affected\u201d by COVID-19. The claim is misleading; the World Health Organization (WHO) told AFP there is no evidence that volcanic ash can destroy COVID-19, adding that it poses significant health hazards.\n\nThe misleading claim was published in this Facebook post on February 29, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \u201cDo you know why the philippines is not that much affected by the coronavirus. It\u2019s because of the eruption of taal. Volcanic ash can kill virus.\u201d\n\nThe Taal volcano erupted on January 12, 2020, prompting the Philippine government to order the evacuation of hundreds of thousands over fears of a subsequent massive blast. The mass evacuation order was lifted two weeks later, after ash and gas emissions steadily shrank, AFP reported here on January 26, 2020.\n\nThe novel coronavirus has spread to at least 99 countries and territories and infected 110,000 since emerging in late 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, AFP reported here on March 9, 2020.\n\nThe Philippines health department has said there were 33 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country as of 4pm on March 10, 2020.\n\nA similar claim about coronavirus cases in the Philippines supposedly being contained by the Taal volcano\u2019s ash has been shared alongside infographics listing its purported \u201canti-viral\u201d and \u201cdisinfectant qualities\u201d here and here on Twitter, as well as here on YouTube.\n\nThe claim is misleading; health experts said there is no scientific evidence for the claim, as they warned against the hazardous properties of volcanic ash.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that volcanic ash can destroy the new coronavirus,\u201d a representative for the WHO Philippines told AFP in a text message on March 7, 2020. \u201cThe purported anti-viral properties of volcanic ash has not been established. [It] is hazardous to health and may result in respiratory issues, eye problems and skin irritation.\u201d\n\nThere is no vaccine or anti-viral medicine to date to prevent or treat COVID-19, the official name of the disease caused by the new coronavirus strain, this WHO page states.\n\nThe Philippine health department issued a similar warning on the health hazards of volcanic ash after the Taal volcano erupted.\n\nThis January 12, 2020 advisory reads: \u201cConditions which may be experienced after exposure to volcanic ash and gases include nose and throat irritation, coughing, bronchitis-like illness, discomfort while breathing, eye irritation, and minor skin problems.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
