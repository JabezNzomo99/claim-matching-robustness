They further found many discrepancies in the font style and size of the bill, indicating that it was photoshopped.\n\nBOOM also analysed the image and searched for a \u2018Sai Balaji petroleum\u2019 and found a similar image on a website Goldmine Electrosystems Pvt Ltd., manufacturers and sellers of handheld billing machines. These machines found regularly at petrol pumps, toll collection centres and parking lots generate a receipt upon completion of payment.\n\nBOOM found that the website under the section for \u2018Petrol pump Billing system\u2019 has uploaded a sample bill.\n\nThis bill and the fake image have many similarities including the name and location of the petrol pump \u2018Sai Balaji Petroleum\u2019 located in Vikhroli (West), Mumbai.\n\nIn fact the vehicle number (MH04BZ9680) and the name of the customer (Vaibhav) in the fake bill and sample bill are the same.\n\nThe seller also has other sample bills for pay and park service, cable network providers uploaded on the site with the same name \u2018 Sai Balaji\u2019 for all establishments.\n\nThe fake bill has changed the date to October 4, 2018 from August 20, 2012, the per litre petrol price to Rs 87.88 from Rs 74.50 mentioned in the bill. These changed details in the fake bill are incidentally where there are discrepancies in font size, alignment and font style. For example the size of the font mentioning the date \u201804/10/2018\u2032 is smaller than the time \u201810:17\u2019 and the end digits of the bill number \u20181345\u2019 are larger than the initial digits.\n\nBOOM also looked for details of the vehicle number mentioned in the bill MH04BZ9680 using the national e-registration services run by Ministry of Road Transport and Highway wherein one can find vehicle owner and vehicle make details via SMS. But this yielded no result.\n\nAlso, the bill states the petrol pump is a 'HPL' dealer but no such petrol supplier by the name HPL exists.", "lang": "en"}
