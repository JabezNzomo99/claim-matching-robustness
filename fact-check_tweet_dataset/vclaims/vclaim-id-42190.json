One reporter covering the trial called it \u201ca federal court tele-novela.\u201d\n\nStill, producers of misinformation online have embroidered the case with politically tinged falsehoods.\n\nOne viral meme claims: \u201cDrug kingpin El Chapo testified that he gave MILLIONS to Pelosi, Schiff & Killary. The Feds then closed the courtroom doors,\u201d referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n didn\u2019t testify during his trial. His entire defense lasted just one day, according to the docket, and extensive media coverage at the time shows he didn\u2019t take the stand. So, he didn\u2019t testify to anything, let alone that he had made payments to U.S. politicians.\n\nOne person who did take the stand, Colombian drug lord Alex Cifuentes Villa, testified that among the Mexican officials who had been bribed by Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s cartel was former Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. But there was no testimony about Pelosi, Schiff or Clinton receiving money.\n\nThe claim is similar to one made in another meme circulating online that we\u2019ve written about. That one alleges that Guzm\u00e1n donated $15 million to Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, a claim that is based on a hoax story published two years ago on a now-defunct website.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nUnited States v. Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera. No. 09-00466. U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. 12 Feb 2019.\n\nFeuer, Alan. \u201cFormer Mexican President Pe\u00f1a Nieto Took $100 Million Bribe, Witness at El Chapo Trial Says.\u201d New York Times. 15 Jan 2019.", "lang": "en"}
