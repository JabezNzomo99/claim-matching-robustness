It also asked readers not to vote for Liberal Party candidates in the 2019 elections.\n\nThe taxial.com article, which was the source of the Facebook post of PilipiKnow's, is based on a November 2 GMA News article about the MRT3 rehabilitation \u2013 \u201cExpect \u2018brand new\u2019 MRT3 after Japan-funded rehab, says DOTr exec.\u201d\n\nDOTr Undersecretary for Railways Timothy Batan said in an interview on GMA News TV's News to Go that after the rehab, commuters can expect a \u201cbrand new\u201d MRT3. The taxial.com article, however, ran with a headline different from the GMA News article.\n\nMore accurately, the \"brand new\" MRT3 will be experienced after the Japan-funded rehabilitation. It's not true that the MRT3 trains were by manufactured by or came from Japan.\n\nOn October 27, the MRT3 deployed the first batch of trains from Chinese state-owned firm Dalian Locomotive. These were bought in June 2013 as part of the MRT-3 Capacity Expansion Project. Due to weight incompatibility issues, the trains were parked until a July 2018 audit declared them fit for use.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japan-funded MRT3 rehabilitation is part of an P18-billion loan from the Japanese government. The Philippine and Japanese governments are scheduled to sign the contract on Wednesday, November 7.\n\nAccording to the National Economic Development Authority, the rehabilitation will \u201cincrease the number of trainsets in operation from 15 to 18 trainsets per hour, increase the maximum speed to 60 kilometers per hour, and decrease headway to 200 seconds.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first false claim we fact checked regarding the MRT3 expansion project. Rappler has checked a claim saying Duterte has acquired 48 \u201cbrand new trains\u201d for MRT3 in less than a year.", "lang": "en"}
