The quotations originally appeared in a satirical article.\n\nTrudeau, who has served as Canada\u2019s prime minister since 2015, announced a plan to address climate change during an October 2019 campaign visit to Iqaluit, the capital of the Canadian province of Nunavut, according to Global News. That plan included a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, the outlet reported.\n\nThe meme, shared over 3,200 times, alleges that Trudeau criticized senior citizens \u201cthat don\u2019t agree with his world view.\u201d (RELATED: Did The Canadian Government Include Black Rifle Coffee Company Products In Its Recent Assault-Style Weapons Ban?)\n\n\u201cThese people generally don\u2019t believe in climate change, green initiatives, basically anything we\u2019re trying to do to save the planet that they won\u2019t be around for,\u201d the image quotes Trudeau as saying. \u201cSo why are we letting them ruin it for the rest of us?\u201d\n\nBut there is no record of Trudeau making the comments attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible media reports about the Canadian prime minister saying the remarks. Nor do the statements appear anywhere on Trudeau\u2019s social media pages.\n\nThe comments appear to come from a November 2019 article published by The Manatee, a parody news website that describes its content as \u201cfictional, critical observations of popular culture and current events.\u201d Yet, while The Manatee makes the satirical nature of its content clear, the Facebook post fails to do so, portraying the quotes as real.\n\n\u201cMy article is entirely satirical and made-up!\u201d Alex Vietinghoff, the author of The Manatee\u2019s piece, told AFP Fact Check.", "lang": "en"}
