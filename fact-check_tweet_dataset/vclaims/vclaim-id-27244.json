He also said that the government of Ukraine was not involved, but likely illegal smugglers.\n\nAs Elleman\u2019s report noted, Yuzhmash is located near territory controlled by Russia-backed separatists in the Donbas, not far from the Russian border, and, amid the chaos of war, Ukraine's east has become a black-market haven.\n\nBut later, when irate Ukrainian social media users began analyzing Elleman\u2019s own possible ties to Russia by mining his Facebook page, he deleted all his social media accounts.\n\nMeanwhile, unnamed U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters that in fact, they have information \"to suggest that North Korea is not reliant on imports of engines\" and that it has \"the ability to produce the engines themselves.\"", "lang": "en"}
