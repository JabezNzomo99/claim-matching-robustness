The incident happened on August 31, 2020 in Alampur area of Murshidabad, where the goddess Kali idol of Nimtala Kalimandir caught fire.\n\nThe images which show the idol before it caught fire and after it was completely gutted by flames, are doing the rounds with netizens falsely claiming that members of the Muslim community have destroyed the temple and idol.\n\nArjun Singh, a member of Parliament and Bharatiya Janata Party's state vice president, tweeted the set of images and claimed that the temple came under the attack of one religious group.

The office bearers of the temple are aware of the harmonious relationship that Hindus and Muslims of the area share. They rule out any communal hatred that could lead to such an incident.\"\n\n\n\nBajpai in the letter further states that the temple's lock was not broken and neither was anything stolen from the temple premises and reiterates that the incident is an accident.\n\n\"This could be an accident but a certain section is trying to give it a communal spin. It is our request to you all... do not make the environment tense and do not do anything that can spark tensions,\" the letter states.\n\n\"The area is a Muslim majority area. But there are 312 Hindu families here. We have been living peacefully and this was a mere accident that could have occurred because of a short circuit.\" Bajpai also sent a photograph to BOOM which shows that neither the lock was broken nor was anything missing from the temple.\n\nWe also reached out to Mrinal Sinha, senior inspector, Nowda Police station, who corroborated the same. Sinha said, \"This is an accidental fire caused by a short circuit and there is no communal overtone to the incident. This is a peaceful area, where people from the two communities have been living in peace.\"\n\nWest Bengal Police has further initiated a legal action against BJP MP Arjun Singh for his tweet.", "lang": "en"}
