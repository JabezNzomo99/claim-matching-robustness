But an Instagram post would have you believe that such a predator was in our midst.\n\nThe image appears to be a screenshot of a news story with this headline: \"Texas man admits kidnapping 79 people to anally probe them while disguised as an alien.\"\n\nBelow a supposed mugshot of this person, the story with an El Paso dateline continues: \"A man who was arrested by the FBI yesterday has confessed to kidnapping and sexually assaulting several dozen people while using costumes, drugs, and special effects to have his victims believe they had been abducted by aliens.\"\n\nThis Dec. 18 post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

World News Daily Report notes that \"all characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2014 even those based on real people \u2014 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\"\n\nBut the Instagram post lacks that caveat, or any other clues to help social media users understand that the headline isn\u2019t real.\n\nWe rate this Instagram post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
