This claim is false; the photo has been doctored to include a placard and the Chinese flag.\n\nThe photo was published here on Weibo on June 1, 2020.\n\nIt shows a group of people kneeling in front of a large Chinese flag as another flies behind them. One person in the group is also seen holding a placard that reads \"HELP US CHINA\".\n\nA screenshot taken on June 5, 2020, of the misleading post published by Weibo user \u96c5\u6674_Jean\n\nAlso Read: No, George Floyd's Death Was Not Staged Using 'Crisis Actors'\n\nThe caption, written in simplified Chinese characters, translates to English as: \"Slogan of US protesters: China, help us breathe!
