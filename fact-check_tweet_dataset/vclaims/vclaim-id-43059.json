Since the 2016 election, Sander has posted over a hundred signs in his yard bearing messages that criticize and poke fun at the current chief executive:\n\nThe Asbury Park Press reported that David Sander, 66, has produced well over a hundred messages that he considers them \u201cpolitical humor\u201d and an exercise of his First Amendment right to free speech. Police, however, recently asked him to take down his latest sign: a suggestive sexual encounter between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the report. Here is The Asbury Park Press\u2019s video on the matter, showing that this isn\u2019t the first time Sander has drawn attention because of his signs:\n\nAs documented in a News 12 Long Island report, at least one of Sander\u2019s banners prompted an obscenity complaint to police, who paid a visit to Sander to advise him he could be charged with a crime if he failed to remove the offending sign:\n\nAsbury Park police told David Sander that his sign depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump in a suggestive sexual position was obscene and violated the law. \u201cWe are here to talk to you about displaying obscene material,\u201d an Asbury Park police officer is heard saying on a police body camera from Sept. 29, one day after Sander posted the sign. \u201cA little risqu\u00e9, without a question. I try to stay away from risqu\u00e9, but I didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with it,\u201d Sander says. The police officers told Sander that they sent photos of his banners to the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office and that the prosecutor also determined the banner to be obscene. Sander often expresses his political views through banners displayed on his lawn. He says that they are just political humor. He has displayed over 100 original banners over the last three years. \u201cFor me to stop would mean for other people out there would be afraid to do it. It would mean that the rights in this country are being eroded,\u201d Sander says. This is the first time that police have visited Sander\u2019s home since he began flying the banners after the 2016 election.\n\nIn this particular case, Sander\u2019s \u201cGod Bows Down to Trump\u201d campaign sign display was meant to be taken ironically (or \u201csatirically\u201d) rather than literally \u2014 it was mocking Trump and the sentiment expressed in the text rather than promoting them.", "lang": "en"}
