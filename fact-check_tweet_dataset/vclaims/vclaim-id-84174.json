The claim is false; the video actually shows diners at a restaurant in the city of Taoyuan, Taiwan.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than 265,000 times since it was shared in a Facebook post here on February 8, 2017.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201cHappen in Singapore. Most expensive restaurant. But the food look yummy. Do you know how much it's cost. $240,000.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\n\n\nThe caption at the start of the video says: \u201cMainland Chinese Reunion dinner for 20 pax at Singapore Resort World Sentosa.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the caption in the video:\n\nThe video shows a group of people being served food at a restaurant.\n\nBelow the video in the Facebook post, there is a photo of a receipt.

The same video was shared on the verified YouTube channel for Chinese news channel Dongsen News CH51 here on January 30, 2017.\n\nThe traditional Chinese language title translates to English as: \u201cCool! Two-meter wide feast using steamer is served! People sitting around: Super luxurious!\u201d\n\n\u2018Two-meter wide\u2019 is a reference to the diameter of the round table.\n\nThe traditional Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201cIt's amazing to have such a full table of dishes on New Year\u2019s Eve! A netizen sent a post that their family went to a restaurant in Taoyuan to have New Year's Eve dinner, and there was a 2-meter-in-diameter huge steamer on the table with 30 dishes, including karasumi, fresh shrimps and oysters, cooked directly in front of you. The film after posted online has raised discussions. People said online that they have not seen such splendid dishes on New Year\u2019s Eve, and it looks as if ancient emperors\u2019 treatment. But some people questioned, can you really finish all these food?\u201d\n\nIn the \u2018About\u2019 section of the Dongsen News CH51 YouTube channel here, it states the channel is part of the Taiwanese news network EBC News.\n\nThis is the official website for EBC News.\n\nThe name of the restaurant is not mentioned in the Dongsen News report.\n\nHowever, keyword searches for Chinese restaurants in Taoyuan found that the restaurant in the footage is A15 Taiwan Food in Taoyuan. This is its official Facebook page.\n\nIts address is listed as Taoyuan District, Taoyuan on its Facebook page here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video with a photo of the restaurant\u2019s interior on its official Facebook page:\n\nAFP has circled in red the parts of the photos which directly correspond in both photos; notably the wooden slat wall, the detailed wallpaper and the grey chairs.\n\nThe video was also exposed as misleading by Singapore based news site Asia One here.", "lang": "en"}
