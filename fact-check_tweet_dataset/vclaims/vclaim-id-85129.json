A key factor in giving the article such prominence was that reporters were able to locate people who said they had heard about Clinton\u2019s alleged advances at the time \u2014 long before he became president.\n\nOne of the first major articles about Juanita Broaddrick, who says Clinton raped her in 1978, also appeared in The Post. Again, it was essential to locate people who said they heard about the incident at the time.\n\nSimilarly, a number of women who have accused Donald Trump have provided corroborators who heard about the alleged behavior at the time it happened, or shortly thereafter. Here\u2019s a sampling of the cases against Clinton and Trump, and the corroborators who have emerged. Trump has adamantly denied the women\u2019s claims; Clinton settled a sexual harassment suit with Jones without admitting guilt and his attorney denied Broaddrick\u2019s allegation.\n\nHer allegation: In 1991, while she was working at a state-sponsored conference, a state trooper asked her to meet with then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton in his hotel room. When she arrived, she says, Clinton tried to kiss her and then dropped his pants and underwear and asked her to \u201ckiss it.\u201d She refused, and quickly left the hotel room.\n\nPamela Blackard, state employee sitting at the registration desk with Jones. She said she noticed Clinton staring intently at Jones and witnessed a state trooper asking Jones to go to Clinton\u2019s hotel room. She recalled that about 10 minutes later, Jones returned, \u201cshaking,\u201d and she told Blackard in detail about Clinton\u2019s actions. Blackard told her to tell no one, as she was afraid they would lose their jobs.\n\nBrad Trent, a New York photographer. He says he heard the story from Anderson at a dinner in 2007. \u201cIt was just girls saying stories about how they got hit on by creepy old guys,\u201d Trent said of the conversation around the table.\n\nHer allegation: While interviewing Trump in 2005 for an article for People magazine about the first anniversary of his third marriage, Trump lured her into a room at Mar-a-Lago and abruptly kissed her, forcing his tongue down her throat. He then said they were going to have an affair.\n\nLiz McNeil, at the time a reporter for People (she is now an editor). She said that she heard about the incident the day after Stoynoff returned from her assignment. \u201cShe was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Green, another People reporter (now editor) who had just returned to New York. \u201cIn an early conversation we had in her office, she told me about what happened with Donald Trump,\u201d Green said. \u201cShe was shaky, sitting at her desk, relaying that, \u2018He took me to this other room, and when we stepped inside, he pushed me against a wall and stuck his tongue down my throat. Melania was upstairs and could have walked in at any time.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul McLaughlin, Stoynoff\u2019s former journalism professor. He said Stoynoff called her at the time of the alleged incident seeking advice on how to handle it: \u201cShe didn\u2019t know what to do, she was very conflicted, she was angry, she was really confused about how to deal with this.\u201d After a discussion, he said, Stoynoff decided it would be best if she kept the incident to herself.\n\nBrianne Webb, her sister. She said Crooks called her immediately about the incident as soon as she returned to her desk. \u201cBeing from a town of 1,600 people, being naive, I was like, \u2018Are you sure he didn\u2019t just miss trying to kiss you on the cheek?\u2019 She said, \u2018No, he kissed me on the mouth.\u2019 I was like, \u2018That is not normal.\u2019 \u201d", "lang": "en"}
