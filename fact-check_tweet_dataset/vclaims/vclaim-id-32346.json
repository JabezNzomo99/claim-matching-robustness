Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: A video of CPI leader, Kanhaiya Kumar being beaten up by a crowd. Fact: The person who was being beaten up by the crowd is not Kanhaiya Kumar, his name is Chandan Kumar. He was thrashed by the crowd as he had thrown a chappal at Kanhaiya Kumar when he was giving a speech at Lakhisarai, Bihar. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nSince the posted video has \u2018Kashish News\u2019 logo on it, when searched for that video on their channel\u2019s youtube account, the original video was found. From the title of the video, it is understood that a person was beaten up by the crowd when he tried to obstruct Kanhaiya\u2019s speech at Lakhisarai (Bihar). In another video of the same event, it can be seen that Kanhaiya Kumar wore a \u2018blue\u2019 shirt, while the person who obstructed the speech and got beaten up by the crowd wore an \u2018orange\u2019 shirt. According to the article of \u2018Dainik Bhaskar\u2019, when Kanhaiya Kumar was giving a speech at an event in Lakhisarai, a person named Chandan Kumar had thrown a chappal on the stage who as a result was beaten up by the crowd around him.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, the person who was being beaten up by the crowd in the video is not Kanhaiya Kumar.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
