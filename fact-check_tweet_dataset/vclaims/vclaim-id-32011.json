However, that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nWhen \u201cLisa on Ice\u201d first aired in November 1994, autocorrect was already a feature available in Microsoft Word. According to The New York Times, Microsoft was advertising the feature as early as October 1993, more than a year before \u201cLisa on Ice\u201d aired:\n\nWhile autocorrect existed prior to this episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d (severely handicapping the show\u2019s ability to predict it), the joke in \u201cLisa on Ice\u201d is actually commenting on another technological innovation: handwriting recognition.\n\nThe Apple Newton was one of the first personal digital assistants (PDAs), which hit the market in 1993. While it was an innovative product for its time, it also had problems. The device\u2019s handwriting-recognition software, for instance, wasn\u2019t great at recognizing handwritten words. This led to critiques in the media (a 1993 article in the San Francisco Examiner was titled \u201cHighly Hyped Newton Weak on Handwriting\u201d) and jokes on popular shows such as \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d\n\nIn fact, school bully Kearney specifically mentions the \u201cNewton Tablet\u201d in the clip from \u201cLisa on Ice\u201d used to further this \u201cprediction\u201d claim:\n\n\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d didn\u2019t predict autocorrect. However, this joke did have an impact on the autocorrect feature that would eventually find its way onto the first iPhone.\n\nApple\u2019s software engineers were so haunted by a gag in The Simpsons they spent years trying to nail the keyboard in the iPhone. As part of an \u2018oral history\u2019 \u2014 essentially a lot of interviews sewn together \u2014 about the Californian company, Fast Company interviewed dozens of former Apple execs. One particularly juicy tidbit it\u2019s just revealed is that software engineers working on the iPhone were traumatised by the Simpsons making fun of the ancient Newton tablet\u2019s handwriting recognition in 1995 \u2026 \u2026\u201dIn the hallways [at Apple] and while we were talking about the keyboard, you would always hear the words \u2018Eat Up Martha\u2019,\u201d says Nitin Ganatra, formerly Apple\u2019s director of engineering for iOS. \u201cWe needed to nail the keyboard. We needed to make sure the text input works on this thing, otherwise, \u2018Here comes the Eat Up Marthas.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d did not predict autocorrect. The visual gag in the 1994 episode \u201cLisa On Ice\u201d featuring the words \u201cBeat Up Martin\u201d changing to \u201cEat Up Martha\u201d on a mobile device was actually mocking the problematic handwriting recognition software on the Apple Newton PDA.\n\nAutocorrect Prediction Summary: \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d supposedly predicted the \u201cautocorrect\u201d feature in a 1994 episode. This feature wasn\u2019t invented until 2007. \n\n Referenced Episode: Nov. 13, 1994. Season 6; Episode 8. \u201cLisa On Ice.\u201d\n\n Facts: Autocorrect has been around since at least 1993. The 2007 date likely refers to the release of the first iPhone. \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d was actually commenting on Apple Newton Tablet\u2019s well-known problems with handwriting-recognition software.\n\nYou can read more about \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d alleged predictions in the Snopes\u2019 collection \u201cThe Simpsons Didn\u2019t Predict That.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
