These have elicited 5,932 reactions, 3,580 comments, and 6,135 shares.\n\nThe Facts: The archbishop did not specifically endorse Otso Diretso or mention any specific candidates when he urged Catholics not to betray God by their vote.\n\nThe archbishop posted a video on his Facebook page which compiles clips of Duterte's tirades against God and criticisms of the Church in the past years.
