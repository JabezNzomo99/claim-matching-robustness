The purported tweet, which shows 1.8 million retweets, reads, \u201cI will be introducing legislation to welcome United Nations peace keepers into the United States #UN #Peace.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Pelosi tweeted the statement. Searching her official Twitter accounts \u2013 @SpeakerPelosi and @TeamPelosi \u2013 yielded no matches, and ProPublica\u2019s archive shows no deleted tweets making a similar comment on July 27 or any other date.\n\nHad Pelosi made such an announcement on Twitter, it likely would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none appear to have reported on it. Her office also has not issued a press release to that effect.

On this momentous anniversary, House Democrats remain steadfast allies in the UN\u2019s important mission.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Pelosi has been the target of a fake tweet. In April, social media users erroneously claimed she tweeted, \u201cI am disgusted with \u2018President\u2019 Trump allowing people to keep more of the money they earn.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
