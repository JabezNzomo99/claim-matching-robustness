An archive of the post is available here. \n\n\n\nBOOM found that the photo is from Muzaffarpur in Bihar and dates back to an incident from 2017 with the then District Magistrate also initiating an investigation into the same.\n\nA search using keywords in Hindi 'Dogs in a hospital' led us to a tweet from December 5, 2017 where a user D Mishra, who describes himself as a journalist with the Hindi daily, Dainik Bhaskar, posted a newspaper clipping of the paper, carrying the same photo. According to the news report, the photo is from the Sadar hospital in Muzaffarpur, Bihar\n\nThe image, which carries two photos - both showing dogs resting on beds in a hospital ward, is from a news clippping of the story published by the Muzzafarpur edition of Dainik Bhaskar. The article in hindi is titled, 'This surgical ward is a rest house for stray dogs at night' and was published on December 5, 2017.\n\n\n\nThe same viral image can be seen in the left corner of the news clipping. See below:\n\nThe webcopy of the same report stated that the stray dogs took shelter every night in a surgical ward in Sadar hospital in Muzaffarpur, Bihar and the lack of hospital staff to oversee things, allowed them to roam around freely. It further said that the ward had 40 beds, 10 of which were being occupied by dogs. Another report by Dainik Bhaskar stated that the then Muzaffarpur district magistrate, Dharmendra Singh, had ordered an investigation and directed the ward attendant and security personal to be stationed in the ward henceforth.\n\nMore news reports of the incident can be seen here, here, and here.\n\nThe recent floods in Bihar have seen several pieces of misinformation being shared around. BOOM has previously debunked unrelated photos claiming to show the condition of COVID-19 care hospital in Bihar during the floods and old photos peddled as from the recent floods.\n\nALSO READ: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra Tweets Old Photos As Recent Floods In Assam, Bihar", "lang": "en"}
