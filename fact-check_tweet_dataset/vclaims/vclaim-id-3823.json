Two of our readers asked us to investigate.\n\nStudies have found that stroke patients admitted to hospitals at weekends are at a greater risk of death.\n\nPeople hospitalised on a Sunday after a stroke had an 11% risk of death within a week, compared to 9% for weekday patients. That\u2019s according to which looked at admissions to English hospitals in 2009/10. It works out to a little above the 20% rise in risk the Health Secretary is talking about.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t clear is why the risk was higher. As with it might partly be because of differences in the types of patients who go to hospital at the weekends, rather than differences in the standard of healthcare at the weekends.\n\nAnd experts and practitioners have questioned how much data from that far back tells us about the current standard of care in the NHS, saying that stroke care has improved greatly in the past few years.\n\nThe study found higher mortality at weekends, but we don\u2019t know why\n\nIn the 2009/10 financial year, were admitted to English hospitals following a stroke, academics found. Those who were hospitalised on a Sunday had an within seven days, significantly higher than the for patients admitted on the average weekday.\n\nThose risk levels take into account the researchers had on the patients and their circumstances, including their age, sex, level of deprivation, previous hospital admissions, and the type of stroke they\u2019d had.\n\nThere were also significant differences in the way patients were treated. Weekend patients were to receive a brain scan on the same day they came to hospital, for instance. They were also less likely to receive , a way of treating blood clots.\n\nThe these differences suggested that \u201ccare for patients admitted on weekends was inferior.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear how much of the extra risk for weekend patients, if any, was caused by differences in care.\n\nThe that in particular, if patients who suffer less severe strokes tend not to come into hospital at the weekend, this might affect the result.\n\nThat\u2019s because it would make for a more challenging \u2018case mix\u2019 at the weekend\u2014in other words it would make the risk of death look higher at the weekend because the average patient would have been more seriously ill when they arrived:\n\n\u201cOne explanation could be unmeasured differences in the case mix and severity of strokes\u2026 the underlying data have only limited information on the severity of stroke (such as patients\u2019 level of consciousness), which has been suggested to be conceivably worse on weekends and, therefore, to affect treatment decisions and outcomes.\u201d\n\nA different case mix could also explain some of those differences in the treatments that patients received.\n\nThese findings were echoed in which looked at patients in Wales. It also found a 20% higher risk of death, and also said there wasn\u2019t enough information to say exactly why. Again, the severity of cases coming in at the weekend is something the research wasn\u2019t able to account for, as critics of the government .\n\nThe figures don\u2019t take account of recent changes to stroke care, according to some doctors\n\nA group of doctors and other experts have written to challenge Jeremy Hunt\u2019s use of this research, saying that the figures used are out of date.\n\nThey focus on the Welsh data, which looked at care from 2004-12.\n\n\u201cWhen Jeremy Hunt criticises the junior doctors\u2019 strike by stating that \u201cyou are 20% more likely to die from a stroke at the weekend\u201d he uses data from 2004-12 that is out of date as it precedes rapid improvements in stroke care. These include new acute stroke units that reduce mortality and disability by 25%. Only 5.1% of patients he refers to were cared for on these acute stroke units, compared with 82% in the 2015 national data.\n\n\u201cRecent audits of stroke outcomes in London show that there is no longer any excess of hospital deaths in patients with stroke admitted at the weekend.\u201d\n\nWe updated this article to include the doctors\u2019 letter to the Sunday Times, as well as more detail on the Welsh research and criticisms of it.", "lang": "en"}
