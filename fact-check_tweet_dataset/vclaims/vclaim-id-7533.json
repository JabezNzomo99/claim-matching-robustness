Mo Brooks falsely claimed river sediment deposits and rocks falling from cliffs cause sea level rise, later writing that this was \u201cthe #1 cause.\u201d Melting ice at the poles and ocean thermal expansion are the dominant causes.\n\u2022 Brooks also said global warming leads to more ice on Antarctica. That\u2019s false. The continent has been losing ice since the beginning of the 21st century.\n\u2022 Texas Rep. Lamar Smith falsely said there\u2019s \u201cno correlation\u201d between sea level rise and carbon emissions. Sea level rise is strongly linked to global warming, which is primarily caused by increased carbon emissions from humans.\n\u2022 Florida Rep. Bill Posey falsely claimed it was \u201c30 degrees warmer when the dinosaurs roamed.\u201d It was never that hot when dinosaurs lived. More importantly, it has never been close to that hot when humans lived.\n\u2022 Posey also claimed the last ice age \u201cwas caused by a cataclysmic collision of an asteroid.\u201d That\u2019s false. Ice ages are caused by changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit and related factors.\n\nThe congressmen \u2014 all members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee \u2014 made their claims while questioning Philip Duffy, a physicist and the president of the Woods Hole Research Center, a climate change think tank. On a number of occasions, Duffy contested what the Republicans said, to no avail. We\u2019ll take their claims one by one.\n\nBrooks, the congressman from Alabama, made two false claims during the hearing \u2014 one about river sediments and cliff rocks and another about ice in Antarctica \u2014 both during a debate with Duffy about the causes of sea level rise.\n\nBrooks asked why \u201csea levels have risen\u201d since \u201chuman beings have been on the planet.\u201d Duffy then correctly explained that \u201csea levels over the last 3 million years have gone up and down in line with the cycles of ice ages.\u201d\n\nDuring their exchange, Duffy also said that \u201cground subsidence\u201d is \u201ca factor in some regions.\u201d Ground subsidence, or the sinking of land, does contribute to land loss in some regions, such as in Louisiana, which we wrote about in March 2017.\n\nBut those answers didn\u2019t satisfy Brooks, so he pointed to factors he believed are causing sea level rise.\n\nDuffy\u2019s response: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that on human time scales those are minuscule effects.\u201d Duffy is right again, as we\u2019ll explain.\n\nBrooks doubled-down on these claims in a May 19 op-ed published on the news site AL.com. \u201cOver the history of planet Earth, far and away the #1 cause of sea level rise has been erosion and its resulting deposits of sediment and rocks into the world\u2019s seas and oceans,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cThere is no close second cause of sea level rise.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2017 report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, global sea level rise is \u201cprimarily driven by two factors,\u201d both directly related to global warming.\n\nFirst, the oceans are expanding because water swells as it gets warmer. According the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the \u201coceans are absorbing more than 90 percent of the increased atmospheric heat associated with emissions from human activity.\u201d\n\nSecond, there\u2019s also more water in the oceans because mountain glaciers and the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are melting, explains the 2017 report.\n\nWe asked Steven Goodbred Jr., an environmental scientist at Vanderbilt University whom we interviewed for another piece on sea level rise, for his take on Brooks\u2019 claim. He did say that \u201csediment does displace water,\u201d but it has a minuscule effect \u201con shorter time scales (<100 years) due to the small volume of sediment relative to the immense volume of the oceans.\u201d\n\nOn time scales longer than 100 years, \u201cit has no real effect\u201d because of a process called isostasy, where \u201cthe added weight of sediment to the oceans causes the crust to sink and the reduced weight of the sediment eroded from the land causes it to rise,\u201d Goodbred added. In other words, there\u2019s \u201cno net change in water level relative to land,\u201d he said.\n\nTorbj\u00f6rn E. T\u00f6rnqvist, a geology professor at Tulane University in New Orleans whom we spoke with for the March 2017 piece on land loss in Louisiana, gave us the same explanation, adding that Brooks\u2019 comments \u201care utter nonsense.\u201d\n\nThis brings us to the second false claim Brooks made. As he continued his exchange with Duffy, Brooks asked \u201cwould it surprise you to know that as global temperatures rise \u2014 assuming for the moment that they do \u2014 that that actually increases the amount of ice that is collected on Antarctica?\u201d Brooks repeated these claims in his May 19 op-ed.\n\nDuffy\u2019s response: \u201cThat\u2019s not true sir.\u201d Duffy is right \u2014 it\u2019s not.\n\nWe wrote about ice levels in Antarctica and Greenland in January, after President Donald Trump falsely implied the globe\u2019s ice caps are at \u201crecord\u201d high levels. According to NASA, both of these ice sheets have declined in mass since 2002. \u201cBoth ice sheets have seen an acceleration of ice mass loss since 2009,\u201d the agency adds.\n\nDuring the hearing, Brooks supported his claim by saying that he \u201cmade a trip down to Antarctica and met with National Science Foundation scientists and they all agreed with global warming and they emphasized that you\u2019re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming.\u201d\n\n\u201c[P]rojected global warming will LOWER sea levels because warmer Antarctic air will carry more moisture above the Antarctic land mass, and deposit that moisture in the interior of Antarctica, where it will take hundreds of years to glacially make its way to the sea,\u201d wrote Brooks in his op-ed. NSF \u201cscientists opined that the increase in Antarctic continental ice will more than offset the loss of ice elsewhere on planet Earth.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to Brooks\u2019 office to ask for the names of the NSF-funded scientists who gave him this information, but we received no response. We also contacted multiple researchers studying the topic, and they all agreed that Brooks\u2019 explanation was inaccurate.\n\nSantiago de la Pe\u00f1a, a researcher at Ohio State University who studies glacier dynamics, told us that, while he was there when Brooks and other politicians visited Antarctica in 2014, he did \u201cnot recall having said conversation\u201d with Brooks.\n\n\u201cCurrent climate models do contemplate an increase of snowfall over Antarctica in a warming scenario, which is logical given a potential increase of moisture in the atmosphere,\u201d he added, but \u201cthe increase would be of an order of magnitude smaller than total mass loss.\u201d\n\nErin Pettit, an associate professor at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who studies glaciers, told us that she \u201cdid meet with the congressional visitors as a whole for about 10 minutes,\u201d but she didn\u2019t speak with Brooks specifically. \u201cThe vast majority of the peer reviewed papers in recent years would not agree with the congressman\u2019s statement,\u201d she added.\n\nIn short, while there might be some ice gained in the interior of Antarctica, there\u2019s a net loss because ice is retreating along the coasts at a faster rate. Other experts in this area \u2014 Eric Steig at the University of Washington, David Holland at New York University and Richard Alley at Penn State \u2014 also told us Brooks\u2019 claim was inaccurate for the same reasons.\n\nWe\u2019ve written plenty of times about claims made by Rep. Lamar Smith, who is the chairman of the House science committee. But rarely, if ever, has a scientist corrected him on the spot, as Duffy did during the hearing.\n\nWhile putting up a slide showing two graphs (see image below), Smith said, \u201cYou will see that for the last 100 years sea level rise has been basically constant,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s been going up at about 1.8 mm per year, and you\u2019ll see that there appears to be no correlation between the increase in the sea level and carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nDuffy interjected, pointing out to Smith that he had \u201cshown a sea level record from one location.\u201d\n\nAgain, Duffy is right.\n\nFirst, the rate of global sea level rise is around four times faster than what it was about 100 years ago. We reached out to Duffy for support for his claim, and he sent us a study led by James Hansen, a climate scientist at Columbia University. That paper summed up previous research on the topic, which showed the average rate of sea level rise was about 0.6 millimeters per year between 1900 and 1930. Between 1993 and 2015, the rate was about 2.6 mm per year, which is 4.3 times faster \u2014 and that\u2019s the conservative estimate.\n\nHowever, we should mention that we\u2019ve written previously that other climate scientists have said the Hansen paper\u2019s future projections for global sea level rise are exaggerated, one of those scientists being Michael Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. We reached out to Mann to ask him if the paper\u2019s summary of past observations is accurate, and he confirmed that it is.\n\nSecond, Duffy is right that sea level rise in San Francisco, or any other specific location, \u201cdoesn\u2019t represent what\u2019s happening globally.\u201d As we explained in March 2017, local sea level rise takes into consideration phenomena, such as ground subsidence, not just melting ice and the thermal expansion of the oceans, which is what scientists consider when they look at rise globally.\n\nPlus, juxtaposing sea level rise in one location with global carbon emissions is an apples-to-oranges comparison. When you look at sea level rise globally and compare it with global temperature rise, there is a strong association, says the 2017 Global Change Research Program\u2019s report. And as we\u2019ve written countless times, there\u2019s also a causal link between global temperature rise and carbon emissions from human activity.\n\nWhen we reached out to Smith\u2019s office for comment, his spokesperson didn\u2019t provide us with any evidence to the contrary.\n\nFlorida Rep. Bill Posey also questioned Duffy about the Earth\u2019s climate previous to the development of human civilization \u2014 and made several scientific misstatements along the way.\n\nDuring their exchange, Posey asked Duffy what \u201cthe temperature on Earth [was] before the last ice age,\u201d to which Duffy responded, \u201cBefore the last ice age, the last interglacial, well, similar to what it was about 100 years ago.\u201d\n\nDuffy is a little off here. According to NOAA, \u201cglobal mean annual surface temperatures were warmer than preindustrial [times] by about 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0C\u201d during the last interglacial period, which started about 125,000 years ago.\n\nPosey followed up by rhetorically asking, \u201cYou think? You don\u2019t think maybe it was 30 degrees warmer when dinosaurs roamed the Earth?\u201d As we\u2019ll explain, he\u2019s much more than a little off.\n\nDuffy then responded by correctly stating, \u201cThere certainly have been epochs in the past when global temperature was warmer than it is now.\u201d\n\nThere have been periods during which the Earth\u2019s mean temperature was warmer than it is today, but Posey is wrong to say that the mean global temperature was 30 degrees warmer at any point when dinosaurs roamed.\n\nNOAA explains: \u201cOur planet probably experienced its hottest temperatures in its earliest days\u201d at more than 3000 degrees Fahrenheit about 4.54 billion years ago. Even after \u201cthose first scorching millennia,\u201d Earth \u201chas sometimes been much warmer than it is now,\u201d the agency adds. NOAA points to two such periods \u2014 between 600 and 800 million years ago and about 55 to 56 million years ago.\n\nNOAA points out that these record periods \u201coccurred before humans existed.\u201d It added, \u201cThose ancient climates would have been like nothing our species has ever seen.\u201d But did dinosaurs roam during either of these periods?\n\nDinosaurs are traditionally thought of as living between 247 and 66 million years ago, a time known as the Mesozoic Era. However, scientifically speaking, dinosaurs still exist today, as research has shown that modern-day birds are a group of dinosaurs that survived the mass extinction of dinosaurs occurring 66 million years ago.\n\nSo, a record warm period didn\u2019t occur when dinosaurs, as we typically think of them, roamed the Earth. Still, since modern-day birds are technically dinosaurs, one could say dinosaurs were still around about 55 to 56 million years ago. But how hot was it?\n\nDuring this period \u2014 what scientists call the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum \u2014 evidence suggests that the planet\u2019s global mean temperature rose \u201cby as much as 5-8\u00b0C (9-14\u00b0F) to an average temperature as high as 73\u00b0F,\u201d NOAA explains. The global average temperature over the past few years has hovered between 58 and 59 F, or upwards of 1.5 F above the 20th century average of 57 F.\n\nSo that comes out to, at most, around 14.5 F warmer about 55 million years ago than now \u2014 not 30 F warmer, as Posey said. In degrees Celsius, the difference would be even smaller. And it\u2019s also worth reiterating that this warm period did not occur during the previous interglacial period \u2014 or the last ice age \u2014 about 125,000 years ago, which is what Posey first asked Duffy about.\n\nIn short, Posey\u2019s statement is wrong on multiple counts.\n\nPosey made another false claim while questioning Duffy about the cause of the last ice age.\n\nAgain, Duffy is right and Posey is wrong. There are additional factors, however.\n\nNOAA explains, \u201cVariations in Earth\u2019s orbit through time have changed the amount of solar radiation Earth receives in each season.\u201d And the warmer periods \u2014 the interglacials \u2014 \u201ctend to occur during periods of peak solar radiation in the Northern Hemisphere summer.\u201d But there are likely other factors at play as well.\n\nPettit, at the University of Alaska, put it this way: \u201cIce ages in general are caused by subtle changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit and Earth\u2019s tilt, with complexities introduced by feedbacks within our climate system and the arrangement of the oceans and continents.\u201d\n\nOne example of a feedback in the climate system is the ice-albedo feedback, NOAA explains. As solar radiation increases with changes to the Earth\u2019s orbit, it melts ice covering the planet, which, in turn, leads to more solar radiation being absorbed by surface, leading to more warmth. Why? Because ice is more reflective, or has a higher albedo, than land or water.\n\nSo where did Posey get this idea that an asteroid caused the last ice age? We contacted his office to find out, but we never received a response.\n\nPosey may be confusing the cause of ice ages with the theory that asteroid impacts caused the Younger Dryas. This is a period between 11,600 and 12,900 years ago when the planet\u2019s climate got drastically colder, explains Nature in a September 2013 article.\n\nBut as Pettit explained to us in an email, \u201cThat theory is definitely not the leading one, but more importantly it only applies to *one* particular cold period of a thousand years at the very end of the last ice age. It did *not* cause the last ice age.\u201d\n\nToward the end of their exchange, Posey asked Duffy: \u201cWhat do you say to people who theorize that the Earth, as it continues to warm, is returning to its normal temperature?\u201d Duffy responded: \u201cIf you want to characterize a temperature above today\u2019s temperature as normal, you\u2019re free to do that, but that doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s a planet that we want to live on.\u201d\n\nPosey then replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get philosophical,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m trying to stay on the science here.\u201d But the fact of the matter is \u2014 he didn\u2019t stick to the science, and neither did Brooks nor Smith.", "lang": "en"}
