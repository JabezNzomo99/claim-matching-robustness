The reporting is heavily supported by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and by other publicly available documents and sources.\n\nWe asked the White House what exactly was wrong with the papers\u2019 reporting. We received no specifics, and were steered instead to McEnany\u2019s unrelated comments criticizing the Times\u2019 reporting on intelligence indicating Russia had offered bounties to the Taliban to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan.\n\nEileen Murphy, the Times\u2019 senior vice president for communications, said the news outlet was aware of no problems with the articles and would have no comment on Trump\u2019s and McEnany\u2019s remarks. The Post did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism of the reporting is part of a larger pattern: his relentless campaign to demonize the press, dismissing its work as \u201cfake news\u201d and seeking to weaken its credibility, as documented in an April report by the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nThe Times and the Post shared the 2018 Pulitzer for national reporting. Here\u2019s what the Pulitzer board said of why the work was honored:\n\nAt the end of her briefing on June 29, McEnany criticized the Times\u2019 article on the bounties and a number of other Times articles. She then turned her attention to the 2018 Pulitzers.\n\nTrump assailed the Pulitzer-winning articles on June 25 during an interview with Sean Hannity at a Fox News town hall in Green Bay, Wisconsin, describing both the Times and Post as \u201cso dishonest.\u201d\n\nAnd he demanded that the Pulitzers be returned at a meeting with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in May.\n\nTrump, May 7: [A]ll of those journalists that received a Pulitzer Prize should be forced to give those Pulitzer Prizes back because they were all wrong. There was no \u2014 because if you saw today, more documents came out, saying there was absolutely no collusion with Russia. It came out very loud and clear. And they wrote for years because they tried to do a number on the presidency and this president. It happened to be me. Pulitzer Prizes should all be returned. Because you know what? They were given out falsely. It was fake news. They\u2019re all fake news. Those Pulitzer Prizes should be given back immediately. And the Pulitzer committee, or whoever gives the prizes, they\u2019re a disgrace, unless they take those prizes back. Because they got Pulitzer Prizes for what turned out to be false stories.\n\nAt a coronavirus task force briefing, Trump singled out Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who contributed to a number of the Russia investigation stories, for criticism.\n\nTrump first demanded that the prizes be returned in a tweet on March 29, 2019 \u2014 even before the Mueller report was released. Trump based his call for action on a summary of the report by his attorney general, William Barr. Barr\u2019s four-page synopsis, submitted to Congress, was criticized by Mueller, who said in a letter to Barr that it \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature, and substance\u201d of his work.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s approach to the Pulitzer-winning articles reflects its stance on the Mueller report.\n\nSince the report \u201cdid not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government\u201d and did not contain \u201ca traditional prosecution decision\u201d on obstruction of justice, Trump has taken the position that he was exonerated and that there was no obstruction of justice on his part. But that is not what the report said, as we have reported.\n\nHere is what the report said about collusion:\n\nHere is what the report said about obstruction:\n\nAs for exoneration, the report says explicitly, \u201cAccordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d\n\nMueller wrote: \u201c[I]f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment.\u201d\n\nThe joint Pulitzer for the Times and Post was for 20 articles, 10 from each of the papers.\n\nReading them several years after they were published, it is clear that they hold up well.\n\nFor example, early in 2017, the Post ran an article that began:\n\nTranscripts released in May confirmed the story. The fact that Flynn publicly lied about his contacts with Kislyak put him at risk of being blackmailed. That\u2019s what led to his firing and his legal problems.\n\nOn May 23, 2017, the Post reported that Trump in March of that year had asked two of the nation\u2019s top intelligence officials, Daniel Coats, then-director of national intelligence, and Michael S. Rogers, then-director of the National Security Agency, to deny the existence of any evidence of collusion during the 2016 election. Both declined to do so.\n\nThe story was confirmed in the Mueller report.\n\nOn June 15, 2017, the Post reported that Mueller\u2019s investigation was focusing on whether Trump tried to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation. That certainly turned out to be the case.\n\nOn May 16, 2017, the Times ran a story that began:\n\nOn May 20, 2017, the Times reported that Trump told Russian officials in the Oval Office that firing Comey had relieved \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on him. \u201cI just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,\u201d the Times quoted Trump as saying, quoting from a memo that it said was the official account of the meeting. The Mueller report also included evidence to corroborate that account, noting that the White House did not dispute that description of the meeting.\n\nOn Sept. 7, 2017, the Times ran a piece headlined \u201cThe Fake Americans Russia Created to Influence the Election.\u201d The article began by focusing on DCLeaks, a website that had recently gone live, posting material stolen from prominent Americans by Russian hackers. The article revealed Russian efforts on social media to hurt the chances of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis Russian meddling was extensively chronicled in the Mueller report, which we covered in our story \u201cKushner Distorts Scope of Russia Interference.\u201d\n\nAs we mentioned above, Trump singled out Times reporter Maggie Haberman for criticism. Haberman was a coauthor of two of the Times\u2019 pieces in the Pulitzer package and a contributor to two others. All of the stories have been confirmed or substantially corroborated.\n\nFor example, Haberman was a coauthor of the article cited above about Trump telling Russian officials that removing Comey had relieved \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on him. She also was a coauthor of an article that began, \u201cBefore arranging a meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer he believed would offer him compromising information about Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump Jr. was informed in an email that the material was part of a Russian government effort to aid his father\u2019s candidacy, according to three people with knowledge of the email.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr. posted the emails on Twitter. They said exactly what Haberman had reported.\n\nWe encourage readers to review all of the award-winning stories on the Pulitzer website. The White House has made no specific challenges to the stories, and a review of them shows that they hold up well.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Rieder is a former media columnist for USA Today and, previously, the longtime editor and senior vice president of American Journalism Review.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
