It is forcing Jews to take off any and all profile pictures with the Star of David in them. It will report the violation as \u201dhateful imagery.\u201d At first, I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. That it was a one-time mistake. That was until people sent me multiple screen shots of the same Twitter violation sent to them over having a Jewish Star of David in their profile pictures and [said] that this has happened before. We are unsure if anti-Zionists are reporting these profile pictures to twitter, or if twitter is finding them by itself. Either way, someone on the twitter team is deeming the Star of David hateful imagery and forcing users to take their pictures down if they want to continue to use their platforms.\n\nTwitter explained via their Public Policy account that they had not intended to interfere with all depictions of the Star of David \u2014 specifically only those reminiscent of the yellow stars and badges used to identify Jews in Nazi Germany, symbols which are often employed in the modern era by anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi groups in a manner that violates Twitter\u2019s Hateful Conduct Policy:\n\nHowever, according to the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA), Twitter was \u201clocking the accounts of users who display\u201d the Star of David in their profiles even when such usage was not in violation of Twitter\u2019s policies:\n\nTwitter has deemed the Star of David, a symbol of Judaism and Jewish pride, to be \u201chateful imagery\u201d, and is locking the accounts of users who display it. Several Twitter users have contacted Campaign Against Antisemitism in recent days reporting that their accounts have been locked, and Twitter has provided the following rationale: \u201cWhat happened? We have determined that this account violated the Twitter Rules. Specifically for: Violating our rules against posting hateful imagery. You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or profile header. As a result, we have locked your account.\u201d The social media platform advises users that if they delete the \u201chateful imagery\u201d, i.e. the Star of David, the account may be unlocked. The Stars of David in the profile pictures of locked accounts vary from artistic blue Stars of David and graffitied white Stars of David to, most ironically, a portfolio of yellow Stars of David.\n\nArutz Sheva and others also stated that Twitter appeared to be taking action against accounts displaying the Star of David in ways that did not constitute \u201chateful conduct\u201d:\n\nThe only time twitter mentions in its rules that A Star of David is considered hateful is [in] \u201cimages altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder that targeted a protected category, e.g., manipulating images of individuals to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to the Holocaust.\u201d None of the users that were considered \u201cin violation\u201d of their rules had such a star. There\u2019s also a fine print in the twitter rules that allows exceptions if it is for educational purposes. In no way did anyone violate the rules, but they have been punished for using a symbol that has such heartfelt meaning to the Jewish people.\n\nTwitter admitted they had erroneously taken action against some accounts displaying the Star of David, but that those instances were mistakes and had since been rectified:", "lang": "en"}
