The statement names a person called Abul Kalam, who had originally posted the video. He and his family used to tie their buffalos on the road which caused trouble to his cousin brother Irshad while crossing the road.\n\n\n\n Moradabad police posted a video, where Abul Kalam himself confessed that he had put out a false notion because he was angry owing to a personal dispute. He added that the Indian flag had been there for a while.\n\nTo put the issue to rest, the police posted the video of the flag as well which was installed on the terrace.\n\nIn conclusion, the above information proves that the dispute that took place among neighbours over a road blockage was intentionally shared with a false narrative.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
