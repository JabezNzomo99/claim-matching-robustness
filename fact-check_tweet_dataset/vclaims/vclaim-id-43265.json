Let\u2019s try to find the veracity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: While a person named \u2018Anurag Mishra\u2019 is involved in Jafrabad gun shootings on February 24th, some propagandists are sharing that the shooter name is \u2018Sharukh\u2019. Fact: The person who fored gunshots in Jafrabad, Delhi is \u2018Mohammed Sharukh\u2019. In one of the photos in the post, he can be seen wearing a \u2018red\u2019 shirt. The person who is in the other photos of the post is \u2018Anurag Mishra\u2019, and he is not the one involved in Jafrabad shooting. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nAccording to an article from the \u2018Hindustan Times\u2019, it is understood that on February 24th, a man wearing a red shirt and blue trousers shot his pistol several rounds in Jafrabad, Delhi. A photo of him can also be seen in the article. From a tweet made by \u2018ANI\u2019, it is understood that the Delhi police identified the Jafrabad shooter as \u2018Mohammed Sharukh\u2019. From another tweet, it is revealed that \u2018Mohammed Sharukh\u2019 has been taken into custody by the Delhi police.\n\nWhen the photo of Jafrabad shooter was juxtaposed with the photos in Anurag Mishra\u2019s Facebook profile, it is clearly understood that both of them are different. From the two photos, the differences related to their eyebrows, eyes, and nose can be clearly noticed.\n\nAlso, as his pictures went viral on social media claiming him to be the Jafrabad shooter, Anurag Mishra posted that he will file a police case on people who are sharing false information. He also said the same through a Facebook live.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, the one who fired gunshots in Jafrabad is not Anurag Mishra.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
