Shapiro studied cohorts of household heads who were 25 to 29 years old in three different years: 1982, 1991, 2001. That means from 2002 to 2013, the first group was 56 to 60 years old; the second group was 47 to 51 years old; and the third group was 37 to 41 years old.\n\nHe found that from 2002 to 2013, median household incomes for all age groups declined, on average, if the household head did not have a college degree. Median incomes of households headed by people without high school diplomas fell an average of 1.9 percent per year, and by 1 percent per year in households headed by high school graduates.\n\nOne important thing to note is the impact of the life cycle effect: people tend to make the largest income gains from mid-20s to mid-30s, continue to earn more at a slower rate until about 50 years old, then even out until retirement.\n\nThe table shows that people in the older age cohort (56 to 60 in 2013) who did not have college degrees made less money over the 11-year period. The next cohort (47 to 51 by 2013) had a similar experience, though they had less income declines than the older cohort. The youngest cohort (37 to 41 by 2013) saw far smaller income declines in households led by non-college graduates.\n\nMoreover, more recent data from 2014 and 2015 would show a different trend, Shapiro said in an interview with The Fact Checker: \u201cI expect it to show that incomes have certainly stabilized, and in broad numbers, they may be rising.\u201d He plans to update the report with 2014 Census figures once they are available.\n\nRubio\u2019s statement does not capture the subtleties in the findings, Shapiro said. However, \u201coverall, the phenomenon is that for the first time, a large share of Americans have seen their incomes decline over an 11-year period that included two expansions and one deep recession.\u201d The findings about education achievement and income show that higher education does not protect you from the overall phenomenon but limits the damage, he said.\n\nFurther, Shapiro noted: \u201cRubio should recognize that it\u2019s [income decline] dominated by the failure of the [President George W.] Bush expansion to lift incomes and the catastrophe of the 2008-2009 recession, which arises out of his policies, not out of President Obama\u2019s. Things have been better under President Obama in general than they were under Bush.\u201d\n\nAs O\u2019Malley did, Rubio\u2019s claim looked at trends between 2002 to 2013, through the recession and slow recovery. (O\u2019Malley\u2019s statement: \u201cToday in America, 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and this is the first time that that has happened this side of World War II.\u201d)\n\nBoth Rubio\u2019s and O\u2019Malley\u2019s statements make it seem as though two-thirds (or 70 percent, in O\u2019Malley\u2019s case) of all Americans are earning less today than they did in 2001 or 2002. Both candidates\u2019 statements use the word \u201ctoday,\u201d even though their data run through 2013.\n\nThe study that Rubio\u2019s campaign cited found that between 2002 and 2013, two-thirds of American households that are led by people who did not complete college, experienced income declines on average over 11 years. Rubio\u2019s statement does not accurately capture that finding, and it does not reflect the life cycle effect or the difference between households and individual Americans. In fact, this report may be better suited to support Rubio\u2019s proposal to increase access to education.\n\nWhile Rubio\u2019s claim did not have the perplexing time element that O\u2019Malley\u2019s did (\u201cthis is the first time that that has happened this side of World War II\u201d), his claim still is problematic. Rubio\u2019s claim, as was O\u2019Malley\u2019s, is not supported by more recent data on average American earnings, which show they have increased between 2002 and 2015. Further, Rubio misused the Wonkblog article, which described where the two-thirds figure originated in Shapiro\u2019s study. And he made the issue partisan, when the timeframe he uses spans the presidencies of Bush and Obama.", "lang": "en"}
