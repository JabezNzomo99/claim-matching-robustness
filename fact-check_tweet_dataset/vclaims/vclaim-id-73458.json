The caption reads, \u201cNegative clip of the Beirut explosion shows missiles coming in hot.\u201d\n\nBut, according to digital forensics and missile experts, the missile has been superimposed into the video. (RELATED: Image Falsely Links Sam Hyde To Beirut Explosion)\n\nHany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who focuses on digital forensics, noted to PolitiFact several factors that make it \u201cclearly and obviously a fake.\u201d Among those are factors are the missile lacking motion blur, looking identical in each frame and disappearing before any impact, Farid said. The missile also appears bent in the middle in at least one frame.\n\n\u201cThis is a tell-tale sign of a crude copy-paste manipulation in which the missile was pasted into each successive frame,\u201d Farid told PolitiFact.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, confirmed to The Associated Press that it is \u201cbasically a cartoon missile that doesn\u2019t look anything like a real missile striking a target.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it were less amateurish, we could identify the actual missile type, estimate the reentry trajectory and speed, as well as look for digital artifacts,\u201d Lewis said to The Associated Press. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t good enough to bother with. This is more derp fake than deep fake.\u201d\n\nSome of the footage that has been manipulated appears to originally come from CNN Arabic. In the unaltered, original CNN Arabic video, there does not appear to be any missile visible. Iterations of the doctored video have been taken down on YouTube and TikTok, according to CNN.\n\nThe massive Beirut explosion has been linked to a stockpile of ammonium nitrate stored at the city\u2019s port that is believed to have caught fire, according to NPR. Over 150 people were killed in the blast and thousands of others were wounded, the Wall Street Journal reported.", "lang": "en"}
