You might actually have to go outside Coors Field almost two entire city blocks or so to find recreational marijuana edibles, instead.\n\nPolitiFact Colorado examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as \"not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life.\"\n\nIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess why this story continues to live on (we have some theories), but it has. It also was flagged by Facebook users as being fake.\n\nThe disclaimer from EmpireSports.co, which is now defunct and hasn\u2019t posted a new sports story in a couple of years, notes it is \"a satirical and entertainment website\" that fabricates content. Another page labeled \"About Us\" further notes that \"sometimes we report things we just WISH would happen.\"\n\nThere also hasn\u2019t been any activity on EmpireSports.co\u2019s Facebook or Twitter accounts since 2015. The home page does link to EmpireNews.net, a separate website that fabricates news stories and is still up and running.\n\nThe owner of both sides, Aaron Smith, confirmed to us that all its new sports stories are now also posted on EmpireNews.net. Smith didn\u2019t know why his three-year-old Rockies story was still being shared as if it were recent, but he said he hadn\u2019t noticed any appreciable increase in hits recently. He directed people to his site\u2019s disclaimer.\n\nSo don\u2019t go looking for cannabis on the ballpark menu, is what we\u2019re saying.\n\nWe rate the statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
