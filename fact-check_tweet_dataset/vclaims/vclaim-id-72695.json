Among his feats, he said his administration oversaw \"the largest investment ever in K-12 education.\"\n\nLet\u2019s look at whether he really was a record breaker when it came to funding Virginia public schools.\n\nMcAuliffe began making the claim midway through his governorship. As proof, his gubernatorial office once sent us a chart detailing total state aid for schools and per-pupil funding from 2001 through 2018.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s claim is based on raw dollars \u2013 money that has not been adjusted for inflation.\n\nWhen he took office, the record for state aid to education was $6.4 billion, set nearly six years earlier during the 2008-09 school year in the last budget before the Great Recession.\n\nVirginia finally broke that record in 2016, when McAuliffe signed a budget with $6.5 billion for the school year that began late that summer. In 2017, McAuliffe inked his final budget, authorizing $6.8 billion for K-12 \u2013 a high mark, again.\n\nIn raw dollars, the McAuliffe also signed budgets that broke the state record of funding $5,248 per student \u2013 also set during the 2008-09 school year. His final budget, in 2017-18, allocated $5,444 per pupil.\n\nThere\u2019s a problem with comparing historic spending levels in terms of the raw money that was appropriated each year: A dollar spent today or in the future doesn\u2019t buy as much as a buck spent in the past. So we took a more meaningful look at whether McAuliffe's plan, when adjusted for inflation, would remain the richest school budget in Virginia history.\n\nMcAuliffe, as we\u2019ve noted before, fails this test.\n\nWe adjusted each of the education budgets this century to 2018 dollars, using inflation data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Under these measurements, the high-water mark came in the 2008-09 school year, when the state spent an adjusted $7.5 billion on public education.\n\nThat figure exceeds the peak $6.8 billion expenditure - in raw dollars - in McAuliffe\u2019s 2017-18 budget. In adjusted dollars, McAuliffe\u2019s peak education budget in 2017-18 falls below the three state budgets that were in effect from July 2006 through June 2009.\n\nWe applied the same inflation adjustments to per-pupil spending, which is the gold standard in evaluating education budgets because it takes into account Virginia\u2019s rising enrollments.\n\nThe glory days for state spending per student once again occurred during the budgets from July 2006 to June 2009. Virginia, in adjusted 2018 dollars, spent $5,675 to $5,966 per pupil during those school years. McAuliffe\u2019s peak proposal of $5,444 per student during the 2017-18 school year didn\u2019t rise to that level.\n\nA side note: Virginia still hasn\u2019t recovered all the ground lost to the Great Recession and won\u2019t anytime very soon. The General Assembly recently approved education budgets for each of the next two school years that don\u2019t match inflation-adjusted spending during the last school year before the recession.\n\nMcAuliffe says that during his governorship from 2014 t0 2018, Virginia made \"the largest investment ever in K-12 education.\"\n\nIn raw dollars, the McAuliffe did sign budgets during his last two years that set state records for overall education spending and per-student outlays. But this is misleading, A meaningful comparison of historic spending levels requires that the figures be adjusted for inflation. When that\u2019s done, McAuliffe\u2019s education budgets never rose to the levels of the three years before the Great Recession.\n\nSo we rate the McAuliffe\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
