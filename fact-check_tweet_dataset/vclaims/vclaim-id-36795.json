Not exactly - There was a policy that regulated religious symbols, such as Bibles and Christmas trees, being placed in public places that was recently overhauled. But there was no outright \"ban\" under Obama on individuals possessing Bibles or other religious symbols or texts in VA facilities.\n\nThe claim resufaced in an article published by USA News on December 27, 2019, titled \"Trump Lifted Obama's Ban on Bibles and Christmas Trees in Veterans' Hospitals\" (archived here), which opened:\n\nThe ban was part of a directive to \"protect religious liberty\" for veterans and their families by ensuring so-called \"inclusivity\" and \"nondiscrimination. \"These directives permitting religious literature, symbols, and displays at VA facilities have now been revised by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

There have been other versions as well.\n\nIn 2014, the VA issued a policy clarification amid several snafus relating to an outside group singing Christian carols, a POW-MIA Bible display being removed - and then put back - and claims by two U.S. Congressmen that Christmas gifts and cards were not distributed to patients. In 2015, another dispute arose over a Christmas tree, a controversy that ended when the tree was put up alongside other religious symbols.\n\nThe new VA policy, updated last summer, allows religious content to be displayed in some publicly accessible displays, patients to request religious literature and medical centers to accept donations of religious literature, cards and symbols.", "lang": "en"}
