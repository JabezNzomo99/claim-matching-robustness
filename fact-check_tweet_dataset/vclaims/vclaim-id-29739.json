IRL, which stands for \u201cin real life,\u201d allows users to \u201csend and receive invites to hang out with friends in real life,\u201d according to its frequently asked questions page. Users can invite others to join the app and send virtual compliments via text message.\n\n\u201cIRL is designed to allow communications only between people who know each other and have each other\u2019s phone number,\u201d an IRL spokesperson told WUSA 9.\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports of sex traffickers using IRL to track the locations of potential victims either, only numerous media outlets debunking that claim. Spokespeople for IRL have also addressed the claim on several occasions.\n\n\u201cThe claims are absolutely false,\u201d an IRL spokesperson told WUSA 9. \u201cWe have not had any reports of sex traffickers on our app or targeting our users.\u201d\n\nAnother spokesperson told Snopes that collecting location information is \u201cnot even technically possible\u201d when people click on either link in text messages from the app.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time rumors about supposed tactics used by human traffickers to abduct their victims have circulated online. In December 2019, the Caller debunked a viral hoax about traffickers putting zip ties on car windshield wipers to distract women before abducting them.", "lang": "en"}
