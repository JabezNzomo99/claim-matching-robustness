No, that's not true: There is no known Antifa connection to the decision by officials in Wake Forest and Gardner, North Carolina, to cancel their parades. The said their safety concerns centered on those protesting the inclusion of a contingent of Sons of the Confederacy carrying rebel flags in each parade and those who might show up to protest in support of the Confederate tributes.\n\nThere have been scuffles about 40 miles away from these towns between supporters of Confederate tributes and students at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, protesting against a Confederate statue on their campus. The students have been protesting against racism, not against fascism. Antifa is a word used to described those protesting fascism. There is also no evidence that the parade cancellation is related to a \"war on Christmas.\"\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Big League Politics on December 7, 2019 titled \"Two Christmas Parades are Cancelled in North Carolina Because of Potential for ANTIFA Violence\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nYes, two Christmas parades were cancelled in North Carolina towns in December 2019, but it was not because of the \"violent Left's war on Christmas.\" City officials in Wake Forest and Gardner, North Carolina, said they cancelled the holiday parades out of concern that police could not control potential clashes between between pro-Confederate groups and anti-racists groups along the parade routes.\n\nWake Forest's police chief did say he was concerned about \"outside agitators,\" but he could name no threats from any specific group. None of the officials indicated if their concern was for violence from the right or the left. There was no indication that an Antifa protest was planned. This is part of the announcement from the town of Wake Forest:\n\nEarlier today, during its regular monthly meeting, the Wake Forest Downtown (WFD), Inc. Board of Directors voted to cancel this year's parade due to the potential for violence. Moments earlier, board members heard from Wake Forest Police officials who reported receiving credible information in recent days that growing numbers of outside groups plan to attend the parade to either support or oppose the Sons & Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\nAccording to Wake Forest Police Chief Jeff Leonard, only one group has notified the Town of its plans to protest, but the department is concerned about outside agitators that show up, wreak havoc then leave.\n\n\"Groups that contact us about their plans to protest tend to follow our rules and regulations,\" said Leonard. \"We're concerned about outside agitators that don't notify us. Radicals don't typically call ahead. These aren't area residents we're talking about. These are professional protesters who have no regard for the safety and well-being of others.\"\n\nWake Forest spokesman Bill Crabtree in an email reply to Lead Stories said his city's decision was not based on a \"specific\" threat:\n\nThe \"Move Silent Sam\" group of UNC students -- named such because the statue's name was \"Silent Sam\" -- tweeted that the Big League Politics story was equating flying a white supremicist flag in a Christmas parade with \"American cultural traditions>\":\n\nThe towns said they could not ban the Confederate groups from the parade because of constitutional concerns.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bigleaguepolitics.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
