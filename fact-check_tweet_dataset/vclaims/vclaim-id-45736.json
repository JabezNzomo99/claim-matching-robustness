Fifty-seven percent of those voters supported him, according to entrance polls. The next closest candidate among high-school-or-less voters was Ted Cruz, who had 20%. Trump didn\u2019t just win with less educated voters \u2026 he crushed it.\n\nAfterwards, in a speech to supporters, Trump touted how many different demographic groups he won in Nevada, declaring that \u201cWe won the evangelicals. We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated,\u201d before exclaiming \u201cI love the poorly educated!\u201d:\n\nAs is often the case, it was difficult to discern whether Trump\u2019s remark about loving \u201cthe poorly educated\u201d was meant literally or ironically or jokingly. Some observers reacted to it with dismay, while others defended it.", "lang": "en"}
