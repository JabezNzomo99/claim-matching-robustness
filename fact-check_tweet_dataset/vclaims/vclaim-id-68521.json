U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from Concord, was among those critics.\n\n\"Just last week, Democrats voted to give $54 billion in foreign aid. All @POTUS@realDonaldTrump is asking for is 10 cents of every dollar they want to give to foreign governments to go to secure our border and build a wall. Is that too much to ask?\" Hudson tweeted after Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nAccording to the White House website, Trump \"has requested $5.7 billion for construction of approximately 234 miles of new steel barrier on the Southern Border, a $4.1 billion increase over the Senate bill.\"\n\nTo be clear: Experts, even right-leaning ones, agree that neither Trump\u2019s request nor a wall would be enough by itself to secure the border. (Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan watchdog organization, called the wall a \"waste\" and The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, last year said the wall \"won\u2019t work.\")\n\nBut let\u2019s set that aside and look solely at Hudson\u2019s math and his characterization of the bill the Democrat-controlled U.S. House passed on Jan. 3. Hudson\u2019s tweet mischaracterizes both what it pays for and who has supported it.\n\nNot quite $54B in aid\n\nGenerally speaking, estimates on foreign aid spending sometimes vary depending on which agencies and funds are considered, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. For instance, the council estimates aid at more than $40 billion per year, and The Economist reports that foreign aid levels remained at $35 billion for 2017 and 2018.\n\nAs it relates to the bill in question \u2013 HR 21, which has passed the House but hasn\u2019t come up for a vote in the Senate \u2013 FactCheck.org and the Washington Post noted that the $54 billion includes more than foreign aid. It also includes $16 billion for the State Department, they reported.\n\nThe State Department operations budget typically includes a range of items, from embassy security to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s salary, said Stephen Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. So it \"would be wrong\" to conflate department funding with foreign aid funding, Ellis told PolitiFact in an email.\n\nHudson spokesman Tatum Gibson acknowledged that State Department funding was included in the number the congressman cited, but didn\u2019t explain why.\n\n\"The point is Democrats voted for tens of billions of dollars for that \u2013 roughly $12 billion more than what the president requested \u2013 but won\u2019t support President Trump\u2019s requested $5 billion to secure our own borders,\" Gibson said.\n\nIf we subtract the $16 billion for the state department from Hudson\u2019s claim, that leaves us with $38 billion in foreign aid spending. Trump\u2019s $5.7 billion request is about 15 percent of that.\n\nNow to the origins of the $54 billion spending plan. It\u2019s misleading to cast the spending plan as a Democratic proposal.\n\nSpending at the same level was first proposed when Republicans controlled the House, as both FactCheck.org and the Washington Post included in their stories.\n\nIn June, the House Committee on Appropriations approved a $54 billion State and Foreign Operations bill. And in July, the Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a similar $54.4 billion budget.\n\nHudson said \"Democrats voted to give $54 billion in foreign aid,\" and that Trump is asking for \"10 cents of every dollar they want to give to foreign governments to go to secure our border and build a wall.\"\n\nHudson has a point that Trump\u2019s $5.7 billion request is far less than the amount spent on foreign aid. But he incorrectly included standard State Department funding in his claim about foreign aid funds. More importantly, his tweet misleads by giving the impression that the spending plan was Democrats\u2019 idea. We rate his claim Mostly False.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
