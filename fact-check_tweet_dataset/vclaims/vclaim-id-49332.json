The post is accompanied by a comment, \u201cWHAT HAS THIS GOVT DONE TO US?\u201d and includes a link to the website worlddebtclocks.com/newzealand.\n\nThe July 1 post has been shared more than 200 times and attracted more than 26,000 views and 40 comments.\n\nAs the world wrestles with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, aggregator websites attempt to reflect the growing debt levels of economies in \u201creal time\u201d. Websites such as commodity.com keep an aggregated running tally on global debt as well as each nation\u2019s public debt. However, it does so with a disclaimer: \u201cWhile we do our best to present accurate data, we offer no guarantees or warranties that the data we present is necessarily accurate\u201d.\n\nFor its New Zealand national debt counter, World Debt Clocks states the data is sourced from NZ Treasury.\n\nNZ Treasury\u2019s interim financial statement for the 10 months to the end of April showed NZ\u2019s gross sovereign-issued debt was $120,323 million (page 15). The Facebook post on July 1 puts NZ\u2019s national debt at $120,153 million ($120.1 billion).\n\nA spokesman for NZ Treasury, Bryan McDaniel, told AAP FactCheck by email that while the figure of $120 billion was accurate to the end of April, Treasury has forecast $134,229 million ($134.2 billion) of gross sovereign-issued debt as at June 30.\n\n\u201cThis is as per Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2020,\u201d Mr McDaniel said. The update was published on May 14, 2020 (page 107).\n\nGross sovereign debt \u201crepresents debt issued by the sovereign (the Core Crown) and includes government stock held by the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZS Fund), ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation) and EQC (Earthquake Commission),\u201d according to the NZ Treasury update (page 134). The Core Crown (page 132) refers to a reporting segment that includes government departments and ministries, parliament offices, NZ Reserve Bank, and the NZS Fund.\n\nAt the bottom of the World Debt Clocks website it says that data is \u201ccollected from official government agencies and central banks or Eurostat\u201d but offers no further information on how that data is mined. It also states: \u201cWorld Debt Clocks have no secret agenda. We are not affiliated, connected, sponsored or even friendly to any political party, pressure/lobby group, or steering party in the world. Our only aim is to provide clear and up to date information about the ongoing debt crisis.\u201d\n\nMr Daniel told AAP FactCheck that since World Debt Clocks is a continually updating calculator, it is difficult to state whether the balance at any point in time was accurate.\n\n\u201cWhat can be said is that the current balance on the clock of circa $120 billion (as at 6 July 2020) is broadly consistent with the gross sovereign-issued debt level at 30 April 2020, however this is not consistent with the forecasted gross sovereign-issued debt level at 30 June 2020 which is $134,229 million as explained.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claim in the post to be partly false. The July 1 post uses a debt figure from worlddebtclocks.com that was accurate for the end of April 2020. However, New Zealand\u2019s revised debt level is forecast to be $134,229 million ($134.2 billion) as at June 30, 2020. So while the debt figure may have been right for April, the number was already higher by the time the post appeared. Partly False \u2013 The claims of the content are a mixture of accurate and inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
