Yet, while the statesman is eminently quotable, there\u2019s no evidence he ever actually said this quote about success and failure.

In fact, a quick internet search revealed that the International Churchill Society has identified it and a thematically related statement as falsely attributed to Churchill.\n\n\u201cWe can find no attribution for either one of these and you will find that they are broadly attributed to Winston Churchill,\u201d reads the International Churchill Society website. \u201cThey are found nowhere in his canon, however. An almost equal number of sources found online credit these sayings to Abraham Lincoln \u2013 but we have found none that provides any attribution in the Lincoln Archives.\u201d\n\nRichard Langworth, a senior fellow at the Hillsdale College Churchill Project, also addressed the \u201cphony \u2018success\u2019 quotes\u201d on his website.\n\n\u201cThese pop up by the dozens every day,\u201d Langworth wrote. \u201cWhile included in some poorly researched quote books, neither can be found among Churchill\u2019s 50 million published books, articles, speeches and papers; and words about him by close colleagues.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator found the earliest close match in a 1938 Budweiser print advertisement that ran in numerous newspapers. However, elements of the expression have appeared since at least 1905, according to Quote Investigator.\n\n\u201cMen with the spirit of youth pioneered our America \u2026 men with vision and sturdy confidence,\u201d reads the ad. \u201cThey found contentment in the thrill of action, knowing that success was never final and failure never fatal. It was courage that counted.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
