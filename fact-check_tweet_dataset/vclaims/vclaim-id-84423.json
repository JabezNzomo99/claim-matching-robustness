These videos go crazily viral on WhatsApp, Facebook and other forms of social media. We as a society and the news media as a whole are completely blind to this underground propaganda which is being carried out by the saffron camp. A neighbourhood chaat-wala has a phone full of videos of cows being cut which are very obvious to the informed eye that the videos are not from India. States where opposition needs to be targeted like Kerala, a video goes viral where it is portrayed that RSS workers are being killed when it was actually a Mexican video. At Alt News, we wrote about how a video is being shared since 2012 and continues to be shared in 2017 where it is portrayed that a Hindu Marwadi girl is being killed in Hyderabad, the little problem with the video is that the girl is neither Hindu, the mob is not Muslim and the incident happened in Guatemala in South America.\n\nThe latest is this series is a video which has gone viral suggesting that a Hindu man is killed by a few Muslims in Nawada, Bihar. It is suggested that the incident happend on April 6th. The text accompanying the video is as follows.\n\nThe video is currently viral on both Whatsapp and Facebook.\n\nBut, is this a video from Nawada, Bihar where Muslims are killing a Hindu? Well, it is not. Before I state further facts, I wish to reiterate that do not believe WhatsApp forwards blindly. The amount of misinformation on WhatsApp is actually starting to be detrimental to the cause of democracy. Coming back to the present case, this is actually a video from Bangladesh. On April 1st, unknown assailants killed Abu Syed & seriously injured Md Ali, two men who were wanted for the murder of Awami League leader Monir Hossain Sarkar. This incident happened in Titas subdivision of Coomilla district in Bangladesh. The issue was also covered by the local news website called Coomilla-r-Kagoj which translates to \u201cCoomilla\u2019s Newspaper\u201d.\n\nThe video was uploaded by a Bangladeshi resident to Youtube on April 2nd.\n\nThus, yet another propaganda initiated by the saffron camp is nothing but a big fat lie. It is easy to see based on the number of cases of false videos that we have presented on Alt News that there is a deliberate campaign to create acrimony between various religious groups by making viral such videos with a deliberately propagated lie. While we at Alt News can keep writing about it, it is of no use if such information doesn\u2019t reach the people who are actually getting influenced by such videos. We request that those who like the work we do to help us spread our word. Every time you see a video which you know is false propaganda, kindly push Alt News articles so that the misinformation campaign can be pushed back. If you\u2019re unsure, please write to us at contact@altnews.in so that we can investigate the case. Share away. Thank you.", "lang": "en"}
