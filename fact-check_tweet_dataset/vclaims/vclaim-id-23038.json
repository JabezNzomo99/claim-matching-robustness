He hails from Telangana \u2019s Adilabad district.Ayub was appointed as a contract driver with the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) in 1998 but after a few years, he lost his job. Then, Ayub worked as a lorry driver and also as an auto-rickshaw driver. In 2014, he got a permanent job with the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) as a driver and operates from the Adilabad bus depot.In June 2016, Navbharat Times did a story with a headline that loosely translates to, \"Modi's brother makes a living by riding an autorickshaw?\" and debunked the false claim that the man in the photo is Modi's younger brother.Ayub told Times Fact Check that people, seeing his resemblance to Modi, often take pictures with him and share it on social media. He said that when he travels to nearby states, people take selfies with him and that he was initially scared about getting such attention.Ayub, however, admitted that he has become used to it now.Here are some exclusive photos of Ayub. The man, indeed, is a Modi lookalike.Times Fact Check traced the auto-rickshaw driver whose photo is being shared widely with a false claim that he is Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s younger brother.We have found that he is neither related to Modi, nor are his photos digitally manipulated.", "lang": "en"}
