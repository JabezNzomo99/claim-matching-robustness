The Abraham Lincoln Association debunked it in 2003.\n\n\u201cFour score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation: conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\u201d\n\nThose words, with which Lincoln opened the Gettysburg Address, are just some of the many that can be found online attributed to the 16th American president. Yet, unlike others, there\u2019s clear evidence that Lincoln actually said them.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said for the quote attributed to Lincoln in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched Lincoln\u2019s writings, as well as his recorded speeches, but found nothing matching the statement.
