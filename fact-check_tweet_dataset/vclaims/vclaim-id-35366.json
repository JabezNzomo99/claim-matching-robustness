The container was repurposed as a water bottle.\n\nIn February 2020, a photograph showing Tennessee state Rep. Kent Calfee drinking from a chocolate syrup bottle went viral on social media.\n\nThe photograph was genuine. However, Calfee wasn\u2019t drinking chocolate syrup. He was just having a sip of water.\n\nThis photograph was taken by George Walker IV for the Tennessean on Feb. 3, 2020, while Calfee was waiting for Gov. Bill Lee to begin his State of the State address. After the photograph went viral, Calfee explained that his chocolate syrup bottle was actually filled with water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a repurposed syrup bottle that I drink my water out of,\u201d Calfee said on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m not going to buy a $25 or $35 or $45 water bottle that\u2019s not worth what it costs because I\u2019ll probably put it down and leave it somewhere.\u201d Calfee said he and his wife, Marilyn, \u201crecycle everything.\u201d \u201cI was fixing to put it in the plastic recycling one day at home, and I thought, shoot, I can put water in that,\u201d Calfee said.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I are farmers, so we believe in taking care of the earth and recycle everything,\u201d he explains, adding that \u201cwhen you have grandchildren you can\u2019t run out of ketchup, ranch dressing or chocolate syrup.\u201d Calfee says he was going to throw away the Hershey\u2019s bottle a few years ago and thought, \u201cyou know that\u2019d make a good water bottle. I\u2019m not going to pay $40 for a water bottle that I might set down and leave somewhere.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
