{"title": "Is a 'Stop Killing Alligators to Make Gatorade' Protest Sign Real?", "subtitle": "A photograph from a 2011 labor strike in London was repurposed to spread a goofy meme about Gatorade being made from real alligators.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2018-03-30T10:17:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-9834", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/stop-killing-alligators-gatorade/", "vclaim": "If lemonade is made from lemons, what is Gatorade made from?\n\nThis preposterous question has been around ever since it was jokingly posted to the Yahoo! Answers forum, quickly becoming a persistent Internet in-joke. The humorous tidbit evolved over the years, as such things tend to do, as it was posted to a multitude of platforms.\n\nAlthough the meme was almost always shared with a wink and a nod, some were confused when they encountered it:\n\nThe image became even more plausible for some when it started getting shared in a political context. We found at least two Twitter users who shared this image as if it displayed the \u201cliberal logic\u201d of a genuine anti-Trump protester:\n\nThe original version of this image featured a woman holding a sign which bore the rather understated slogan, \u201cI\u2019m Really Not Happy About This.\u201d It was taken by photographer Stefan Rousseau in November 2011 as an estimated two million public sector workers went on strike in London:\n\nTens of thousands of people joined rallies around the UK as a public sector strike over pensions disrupted schools, hospitals and other services. About two-thirds of state schools shut, and thousands of hospital operations were postponed, as unions estimated up to two million people went on strike. The TUC called it \u201cthe biggest strike in a generation\u201d. The prime minister described it as \u201ca damp squib\u201d.\n\nTwitter user and photographer @HeardInLondon also captured a photograph of this woman with her \u201cI\u2019m Really Not Happy About This Sign.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at Rousseau\u2019s genuine image (left), the doctored fake (center), and @HeardInLondon\u2019s image (right) for confirmation:\n\nAdditionally, while we don\u2019t doubt that someone, somewhere, somehow believes that Gatorade comes from alligators, this line of reasoning originated as a humorous question and most often gets shared in jest \u2014 not as a genuine query or opinion.", "lang": "en"}
