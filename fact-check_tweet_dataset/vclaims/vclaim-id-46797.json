Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Photos of Hindu gods and goddesses were burnt during the anti-CAA protests. Fact: It is an old video. The same video was found to be in circulation on the internet from August-2018. So, the video is not related to the recent anti-CAA protests. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nA tweet with the same video and a similar claim was also re-tweeted (archived) by Sambit Patra (National Spokesperson of BJP).\n\nWhen searched with the keywords on Facebook, a similar video (extended version) was found to be uploaded by a user in August-2018. The video (archived) had the following description \u2013 \u201c*Young Ambedkarites burning portraits of Hindu Gods in Ashokpuram MYSORE* to protest against Sanghis who burned copies of the Constitution.\u201d While it can be concluded that the video is an old one and is not related to the recent anti-CAA protests, the exact context of the video cannot be ascertained from the available information.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video is being falsely shared as \u201cHindu gods and goddesses\u2019 photos burnt in the anti-CAA protests\u201d\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
