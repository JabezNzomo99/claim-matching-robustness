Maybe white privilege is that whites are the only race that can be openly discriminated against and it\u2019s okay. Replace \u201cwhite\u201d with \u201cblack\u201d and there would be a nationwide uproar. Such a double standard. Post let\u2019s hang all blacks and see how fast shit gets banned\n\nAlthough we\u2019ve encountered dozens of postings of this image, we\u2019ve yet to come across any postings that included a link back to the original post. We were also unable to find this message or \u201cAdam Butsch\u201d on Facebook. It\u2019s possible that this message was deleted, but the fact that it is not currently on the social media site runs counter to the claim that Facebook is allowing this message to spread.\n\nWe reached out to Facebook for more information about this alleged post, as well as the platform\u2019s alleged determination that it did not violate the company\u2019s community standards. A spokesperson told us that they were unaware of any such posting by a person of this name. The spokesperson also said that they found no indication that a Facebook representative posted a response to this message saying that it didn\u2019t violate their community standards.\n\nFurthermore, the content of this message is in clear violation of Facebook\u2019s hate speech policy, the spokesperson told us, and if the social media network encountered this post on their site, employees would remove it.\n\nOur Community Standards apply to everyone, all around the world, and to all types of content. They\u2019re designed to be comprehensive \u2013 for example, content that might not be considered hateful may still be removed for violating a different policy. We recognize that words mean different things or affect people differently depending on their local community, language, or background. We work hard to account for these nuances while also applying our policies consistently and fairly to people and their expression. In the case of certain policies, we require more information and/or context to enforce in line with our Community Standards.\n\nIt should also be noted that this meme does not feature a singular screenshot. This is a combination of two separate (and not necessarily related) images. We\u2019ve also been unable to find any higher resolution versions of this image. As this is a low quality screenshot, it\u2019s difficult to tell if any of the text in this message (most importantly the \u201cAdam Butsch\u201d in the message allegedly sent by Facebook) has been altered.\n\nIn short, we have not found any proof that this posting from \u201cAdam Butsch\u201d was ever posted to Facebook. If it was, it has since been deleted. A spokesperson for Facebook also told us that this message would have violated its hate speech policy if it was truly posted to Facebook, and that the social network would have removed it employees ever encountered it.", "lang": "en"}
