The following is an excerpt from Article 5 of the treaty:\n\nThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them ... will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n\nIt states that an attack on one member country would be considered an attack on all of them - and that that they could retaliate as they wished to restore peace to the North Atlantic area.\n\nIndia is not eligible to join NATO.\n\nNATO is an alliance exclusively for North American and European members, as stated by the alliance themselves.\n\nPlus, the inclusion of of new members into NATO is a decision that the members must make by consensus, and is not one the United States can make alone.\n\nIts membership criteria can be read here\n\nOn April 8, 2019 the US Congress introduced legislation to designate India as a 'NATO-Ally', with respect to their Arms Export Control Act, as reported by Livemint.\n\nThe Bill - HR 2123 - to advance the US-India strategic partnership, can be found the officially with the US Congress here.\n\nSuch a status would put India at par with:\n\u2022 Non-NATO strategic allies of the United States, such as Australia, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.\n\nSuch a designation would give India access to research and development opportunities, loans and closer arenas of defence cooperation otherwise not available to non-NATO members by the United States.\n\nIndia is already a 'Major Defence Partner' of the United States, a designation is received in 2017.\n\nThis shows the difference between full-NATO membership and the United States' plan to treat India at par with NATO allies.", "lang": "en"}
