Two days later, social media users claimed the officer \u2060\u2014 whom news reports had identified as Derek Chauvin \u2060\u2014 had shared a stage with U.S. President Donald Trump at a Minneapolis rally in October 2019, where the president supposedly praised Chauvin for his service.\n\nThe claim \u2014 which spread online simultaneously with a photograph that users believed to show Chauvin wearing a \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d hat (here\u2019s our fact check of that claim) \u2014 spurred Americans\u2019 outrage over what they described as the senseless killing of Floyd by police. One person said on Twitter in reference to Chauvin\u2019s alleged support for Trump:\n\nMultiple sources told the Star Tribune newspaper that Chauvin, 44, was the officer seen in the viral video kneeling on and pinning down Floyd before his death at a local hospital. Four officers involved in the case (including Chauvin) were fired from the city\u2019s police department on May 26, and the FBI was investigating under what circumstances, exactly, Floyd died.\n\nThe photos in the above-mentioned claim are indeed from a Trump rally at the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis on Oct. 10, 2019. But they do not show Chauvin.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened at the rally: Led by Lt. Bob Kroll, the head of the Minneapolis police union, a group of about a dozen people wearing red \u201cCops for Trump\u201d T-shirts shared the stage with the president for about three minutes during the hours-long event. Kroll addressed the crowd, thanking Trump for his support for law enforcement, and each member of the group shook hands with the president, with some of them giving him a hug.\n\n\u201cI came right here to Minnesota, and I pledged to address this really important issue, and it\u2019s the issue of law enforcement,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cThe respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound.\u201d\n\nAmong the people who hugged Trump was a man who at one point held a sign that read \u201cLAW & ORDER VOTE TRUMP\u201d above his head on stage with a big smile. He was the person at the center of the May 2020 online buzz.\n\nIn a phone interview with Snopes early May 27, 2020, Sgt. John Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, essentially debunked the assertion, while emphasizing that whoever was photographed at the rally was not on duty and, therefore, not covered by parameters on which the department would comment.\n\nAsked explicitly if the man photographed on stage with Trump at the Minneapolis rally is Chauvin, Elder said:\n\nI don\u2019t think it is. I think it\u2019s one of our retired officers. \u2026 The people that were front and center were federation folks and some were retired federation folks, and he (the officer involved in Floyd\u2019s death) doesn\u2019t fall anywhere in that category. It could be, but I\u2019ll tell you, I certainly don\u2019t think it is. My official comment is: Whoever it is, is off duty.\n\nLater that day, journalists with TV station FOX9 contacted Kroll, the leader of the \u201cCops for Trump\u201d group at the rally, who also said the officer in question was not Chauvin. Then, on May 28, 2020, Kroll went further with his comments and identified the man in question as Bloomington Police Federation President Mike Gallagher.\n\n\u201cCan you put a stop to the false narrative please?\u201d Kroll told the AP. \u201cNone of the officers in the incident were near the Trump rally.\u201d\n\nIn sum, given the differences in appearance between the Minneapolis police officer shown in the video kneeling on Floyd and the person on stage with Trump, the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s spokesman\u2019s belief that it was not Chauvin photographed front and center at the rally, and Kroll\u2019s comments to journalists, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
