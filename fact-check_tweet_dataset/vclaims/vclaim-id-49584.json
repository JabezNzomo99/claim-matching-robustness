Thousands of people lived on the dumpsite and earned a living by picking up trash for recycling. It was closed in the 1990s and people who lived on the site moved elsewhere. Here is a report from the Asian Development Bank on the closure and life afterwards for the people who lived there.", "lang": "en"}
