(All India Congress Committee)\n\nThe clip is from a two-part documentary series called The Persuasion Machine, Secrets of Silicon Valley, presented by writer and tech blogger Jamie Bartlett. The documentaries were aired around August 2017. Jamie confirmed on Twitter that while he didn't ask any specific questions related to the Congress, the image from the video is not photoshopped.\n\nThe existence of the poster at Cambridge Analytica's CEO's office was first reported by the Economic Times.\n\nLed by Randeep Singh Sujrewala offline and IT cell in-charge Divya Spandana, online; so far the party has repeatedly and categorically denied engaging with Cambridge Analytica at a regional or national level.\n\nBut speaking to journalist Barkha Dutt, Spandana conceded that the UK-based data analytics company did approach them to work in India but their proposal was never accepted by the party. This is a new revelation from a party that always denied any engagement with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe discovery comes a day after Cambridge Analytica\u2019s former Director of Research turned whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the House of Commons committee in the UK that he believed the Congress party was a client of Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\u201cI believe their client was Congress but I know that they have done all kinds of projects\u2026 I don\u2019t remember a national project but I know regionally. India\u2019s so big that one state can be as big as Britain. But they do have offices there, they do have staff there,\" Wylie told the committee.\n\nAlso Read: \u201cI Believe Their Client Was Congress\u201d: Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower\n\nFollowing the nearly four-hour televised session, Christopher Wylie tweeted that he had been contacted by several journalists from India pressing him for additional details.\n\n\"To the most frequently asked question - yes SCL/CA works in India and has offices there. This is what modern colonialism looks like,\" he tweeted.\n\nSCL or Strategic Communication Laboratories is the parent company of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe tweet detailed election data analysis work done by SCL India since 2003. While the tweet shows that SCL India had worked with several parties in different regional elections, the company also worked with multiple candidates in the 2009 general elections. SCL claimed that the candidates who employed their proprietary data collection methodologies to form strategies in 2009 ensured their success in the election. However, the tweet does not mention the names of the parties SCL worked with in all these elections or whether they only worked with the Congress party.\n\nFor the BJP, these fresh links of Cambridge Analytica to the Congress have come as a shot in the arm as they fight a pitched battle with the party to dislodge it from power in the politically significant state of Karnataka in May this year. The ruling party was quick to target the Congress on Twitter.\n\nWhile the BJP is lapping up these fresh links to the Congress with both hands, they also continue to be under the scanner based on interviews given by Avneesh Kumar Rai, a political consultant working with Cambridge Analytica's Indian partner Ovleno Business Intelligence.\n\nAlso Read: Cambridge Analytica \u2013 Facebook Fallout: Time For BJP & Congress To Come Clean\n\nRai had told several reporters, including news website The Print last week that Cambridge Analytica's actions were suspicious in nature, resulting in him parting ways with the company and its now suspended CEO Alexander Nix. Rai said that he got to know from an Indian-American lady working for a Indian businessman in the US that they had hired SCL UK (SCL UK is the parent company of Cambridge Analytica) to infiltrate the Congress machinery and ensure their defeat.\n\nThe Print also reported that Rai worked with BJP leader Mahesh Sharma, currently the minister of state (independent charge) for culture in the 2009 general elections when he fought for the Gautam Buddh Nagar seat in UP. Sharma had lost the election in 2009.", "lang": "en"}
