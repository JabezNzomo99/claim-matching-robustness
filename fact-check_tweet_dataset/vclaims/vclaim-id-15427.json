NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the idea is to improve NATO's \"situational awareness\" in the Black Sea region.\n\n\"Right now, one of NATO\u2019s naval groups is on patrol in the Black Sea. And today, it is exercising with Ukrainian and Georgian ships,\" Stoltenberg told reporters on April 4.\n\nRussian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin had taken Hutchison\u2019s announcement in \u201ca negative light,\u201d adding \u201cwe do not understand what it means.\"\n\nRussian State Duma deputy of the Republic of Crimea, Ruslan Balbek, however, offered a more strongly-worded response:\n\n\u201cAs for the passage of the Ukrainian ships through the Kerch Strait ... no matter how much NATO beats its chest, the ships will pass through it only in accordance with Russian rules, and not anybody else\u2019s. Let NATO launch even half of its fleet into the Black Sea.\u201d\n\nFranz Klintsevich, a member of the Federation Council\u2019s Committee on Defense and Security, called the potential of U.S. vessels accompanying Ukrainian ships through the Kerch Strait a \u201cprovocation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are trying to arrange a provocation, based on the idea that Crimea is not ours and without complying with international norms, you will be attempting to break through the border of the Russian Federation, all of which will be harshly suppressed, whether we are talking about Ukrainian, American or any other ships,\u201d he said.\n\nKlintsevich added that the United States can be present in the Black Sea in accordance with existing agreements, \u201cno more and no less.\u201d\n\nIn any case, his attempts to both appeal to international norms at a time when Russia has unilaterally redefined Ukraine\u2019s borders is contradictory.\n\nThe Kerch Strait became a point of contention in November 2018 after Russian Coast Guard boats rammed a Ukrainian tugboat on its way to transit the Kerch Strait from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov, between Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea. The incident ended with Russian vessels firing on two Ukrainian naval patrol boats that came to the aid of the tug, and Russian forces capturing all three Ukrainian vessels along with their crews.\n\nSpeaking at the Atlantic Council in Washington last October, the head of the U.S. Navy forces in Europe, Adm. James Foggo, said that as an inland, semi-enclosed body of water, the Sea of Azov is governed by Article 123 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\nArticle 19 of UNCLOS allows foreign ships, even military vessels, to pass through the territorial waters of another state so long as that passage is \u201cnot prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal state.\u201d\n\nBut international law in regards to navigating the Kerch Straight and the Sea of Azov have been complicated by Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula.\n\nVladimir Socor of the Jamestown Foundation wrote that to the extent any legal status for the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait even exists, \u201cit is murky.\u201d\n\nSocor said that legal status was codified in the \u201ctreaty on cooperation between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the use of the Azov Sea and Kerch Strait,\u201d which was signed in December 2003 and ratified by both parliaments the following April.\n\nSocor said this treaty defines the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait as \u201chistorically internal\u201d waters of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, noting that the qualifier \u201chistorically internal\u201d is meant to emphasize that they have never had international status.\n\nHe said that while Russia has cited this treaty to justify its use of force in the two bodies of water, it unilaterally overturned the agreement following the annexation of Crimea.\n\nSocor noted glaring omissions in that treaty, including the fact that it makes \u201cno reference to general international law, nor to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\u201d\n\nMykhailo Samus, deputy director for international issues at Ukraine\u2019s non-governmental Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, argued that Russia has \u201cconsistently intended to create conditions for the Sea of Azov to be classified as an inland sea,\u201d whereby the norms of international maritime law would not apply.\n\nBut as no separate delimitation deal determining the borders of the Sea of Azov were ever finalized, Samus says a legal vacuum was created which \u201callows Russia to freely interpret and independently determine such borders.\u201d\n\nAnd following the annexation of Crimea, he says Russia no longer acts as if the Sea of Azov is an inland sea of Ukraine and Russia, but strictly a Russian sea.\n\nG\u00fcnther Handl, a professor of international law at Tulane University, told Polygraph.info that arguing Crimea is Russian land is \u201ca reflection of the status quo in practical terms,\u201d in so far as \u201cmight makes right.\u201d\n\n\u201cFormally speaking [Klintsevich\u2019s position] is incorrect because Russia\u2019s right to Crimea has not been recognized. Crimea is recognized as Ukrainian,\u201d he said, adding Ukraine is essentially moving through its own internal waters when traversing the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait.\n\nAnd as the Sea of Azov connects with \u201canother body of high seas water,\u201d Handl said both sides qualify for innocent passage.\n\nBut even then, Handl said the legal status of Crimea could be immaterial, as the regime of innocent passage or transit passage should apply, making any Russian attempts to police the waters illegal.\n\n\u201cThere is no right for costal state(s) to take any action whatsoever at sea \u2026 military vessels can go through in normal formations [and] planes could be taking off and landing while transiting through the international straight,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Handl said he would be surprised if NATO \u201ctried to project forces into the area.\u201d\n\nAnd while the status of the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait remains murky, United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262, found no basis for \u201cany alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol,\u201d nullifying any attempts by Russia to treat the Sea of Azov as a strictly Russian sea.\n\nPolygraph.info finds Klintsevich\u2019s assumption that the waters surrounding Crimea are an extension of the Russian Federation is false.", "lang": "en"}
