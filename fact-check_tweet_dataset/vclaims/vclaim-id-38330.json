CNN also included the inaccurate statistic in the body of a Feb. 28 article.\n\n\u201c38 percent of Americans wouldn\u2019t buy Corona beer \u2018under any circumstances\u2019 because of coronavirus, according to a recent survey,\u201d CNN International tweeted. \u201cJust to be abundantly clear: There is no link between the virus and the beer.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
