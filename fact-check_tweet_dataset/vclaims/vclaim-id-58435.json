It supposedly shows an advertisement from the New York Telephone Company that touted the Bell Telephone as a way to maintain relationships with people who were in isolation due to the so-called \u201cSpanish Flu.\u201d One posting of this image from Reddit was accompanied by a caption that noted history really does repeat itself:\n\nPeople who are in quarantine are not isolated if they have a Bell Telephone. The Bell Service brings cheer and encouragement to the sick, and is of value in countless other ways. Friends, whether close at hand or far away, can be easily reached, because Bell Service is universal service.\n\nThis is a genuine advertisement from the New York Telephone Company touting the benefits of a phone to maintain social distancing. However, the ad was first published several years before the outbreak of the Spanish flu.\n\nHere\u2019s a version of this advertisement published in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Nov. 17, 1910:\n\nThe ad doesn\u2019t appear to refer to any specific city-wide quarantines put in place to deal with any illness. Rather, it appears this ad was targeting individuals who may know someone who was being kept in isolation, possible due to a contagious disease such as smallpox, leprosy, or cholera. Newspaper clippings at the time also reveal several instances of local quarantines that were implemented to contain various outbreaks.\n\nIn 1900, for instance, the \u201cSan Francisco plague,\u201d an outbreak of bubonic plague in California, resulted in quarantine restrictions as far away as Texas. In 1903, the New York City Department of Health opened a quarantine facility to isolate tuberculosis patients. In 1910, when this advertisement first appeared in the St. Louis Dispatch, officials in the Missouri city were asking people to quarantine after multiple cases of scarlet fever were found at one of the city\u2019s schools.\n\nWhile this advertisement was created before the Spanish flu (a misnomer for the 1918 flu pandemic), we have little to quibble with the observation that \u201chistory repeats itself.\u201d For instance, as this ad suggests, phones helped to maintain social relationships with individuals separated by illness, and in 2020, video-conferencing apps saw a big increase in use for the same reason.", "lang": "en"}
