A few hours after his death, a video of a man singing next to Kapoor started circulating on social media.\n\nIn the video, the actor is seen lying on a hospital bed, as the man next to him sings \u201cTere dard se dil aabaad raha\u201d from Kapoor\u2019s hit movie \u201cDeewana\u201d. The actor later blesses the man. Netizens started claiming that this was the last video of the actor from the Mumbai hospital he was admitted in.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is almost three months old. The video was shot in the first week of February when Kapoor was admitted at Max hospital in Delhi\u2019s Saket.\n\nTwitter user \u201cNagma\u201d shared the video on Thursday with the caption, \u201cClip of last night, with doctors at the Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai. You are a Legend Rishiji you will always be in our hearts and mind\u201d. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nMany prominent media houses such as \u201cThe Times of India\u201d, \u201cAmar Ujala\u201d and \u201cAajTak\u201d had also initially reported it as the actor\u2019s last video. Most of them later corrected the story.\n\nOn closer observation, we found that the man singing in the video is wearing a woolen sweater. Since the temperature in Mumbai has already crossed 30 degrees, so this could only be an older video.\n\nTaking this as lead, we ran a reverse search on one of the frames from the viral video and found that it was uploaded on YouTube by \u201cDHEERAJ KUMAR SANU\u201d on February 3, 2020. This person had also shared a selfie with the \u201cBobby\u201d actor in the same clothes on Facebook on February 4. He himself can be seen singing in the viral video.\n\nIndia Today contacted Dheeraj who confirmed that he had shot the video on February 1 or 2 (tentatively) when Kapoor was admitted to Max hospital in Saket. Dheeraj is a ward boy in the hospital. He hails from Ranikhet in Uttarakhand and is presently staying in Delhi\u2019s Mehrauli area.\n\nMax hospital has also confirmed to India Today that Kapoor was admitted there in the first week of February. We also found some media reports published on February 2, saying that the actor was hospitalised due to an infection.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the viral video was not shot in Mumbai\u2019s Reliance Foundation Hospital a night before the actor died. It was shot in the first week of February when he was admitted in hospital in Delhi. Also, the person singing in the video is not a doctor as claimed, but a ward boy.", "lang": "en"}
