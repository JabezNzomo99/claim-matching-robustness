Sultan\u2019s wife is carrying the Ramayana on her head towards the temple along with Sheikh Mohammed and Ram Katha Vachak Moraji Bapu. Truly incredible view,\u201d reads a viral message shared with a video on social media.\n\nIt is widespread on both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe above message is being circulated with a video where Ram Katha preacher Morari Bapu can be seen walking amongst the public at an event. The message claims that as promised to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sultan Sheikh Mohammed has built a temple in Abu Dhabi. It is being claimed that the visuals depict the wife of Sultan Sheikh Mohammed carrying the holy Ramayana on her head while she is accompanied by her husband and the preacher himself.\n\nThe video was also shared in 2019.\n\nIt was in fact viral on Facebook and Twitter with the same message.\n\nAlt News had earlier debunked another video from the same event when it was falsely claimed by leading news channels Times Now and Zee News that Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan inaugurated the Ram Katha of Morari Bapu in Abu Dhabi. Later, it was found that the person is a United Arab Emirates-based columnist and commentator on Arab affairs named Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi and NOT the Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\nComing to the video, the same UAE based columnist Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi can be seen walking with Morari Bapu. You can see his profile here. The clip from the complete video, uploaded on Morari Bapu\u2019s official YouTube channel, can be seen below. In his opening remarks, an unknown speaker can be heard announcing a list of guests. However, the name of the Crown Prince is not announced in this list. He also cannot be visually spotted among the guests were present for the event. Hence, it is evident that Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was not present at the event.\n\nMoreover, ABP News also found out that the woman carrying the holy book was Siya, the organizer\u2019s daughter and not from the Royal family. In the video posted below, Morari Bapu in a statement given to the channel can be heard saying that she was the organizer\u2019s daughter and her name is Siya.\n\nAs far as the construction of a temple in Abu Dabhi is concerned, the foundation stone of the first Hindu temple was laid recently in April 2019. The foundation-stone laying ceremony was presided by Mahant Swami Maharaj, the spiritual leader of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha. It will be built on the land gifted to the Indian community by Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan.", "lang": "en"}
