The locale is known as the Caynton Caves, and is well known locally in England where is lies, and has been since at least the 19th century. The story about it being a Knights Templar site, however, appears to be rather new. Remarkably enough for what would be an archaelogical find of major importance -- if true -- there is nothing whatsoever that I can find in Google Books or Google Scholar on the Caynton Caves and their supposed connection to the Knights Templar. What I can find is this: that the caves were the work of an eccentric British gentleman back in the days of Queen Victoria.\n\nDiscovered - a series of underground caves under a rabbit hole in Shropshire - that date back 700 years - I LOVE this! Better than fiction.\n\nIn early March 2017, multiple outlets covered the purported discovery of Knights Templar caves they suggested were found down a \u201crabbit hole\u201d in the western England county of Shropshire:\n\nCaverns used by the shadowy warrior monks 700 years ago are just a few feet inside a rabbit hole \u2026 Once used as a ceremonial spot for the followers of a secretive religious sect, these are the underground caves offering safe haven after leaders of the free world brutally dismantled the group\u2019s power base. The caves in Shropshire were once a place of pilgrimage and worship for followers of the Knights Templar, a feared fighting force during the Crusades who built an international power base on their reputation and spoils. The untouched caverns date back to a time when the Knights were prominent before King Philip IV of France, fearful of their power and deeply in their debt, attempted to dismantle the renowned group.\n\nThe BBC reported that the \u201cmystery caves\u201d were discovered down a \u201crabbit hole,\u201d hinting that the caves were a brand-new and unexpected discovery:\n\nAn apparently ordinary rabbit\u2019s hole in a farmer\u2019s field leads to an underground sanctuary said to have been used by devotees of a medieval religious order \u2013 but is everything what it seems? According to local legend, the Caynton Caves, near Shifnal, in Shropshire, were used by followers of the Knights Templar in the 17th Century. Located less than a metre underground, they appear to be untouched structurally.\n\nBuried at the very end of the BBC\u2019s article was an indication that the caves were not actually a new discovery, saying that they were reportedly \u201csealed up in 2012 in a bid to keep away vandals\u201d. Extensive documentation of the caves appear on the internet, with one series of images taken by a visitor in 2009. A network of Shropshire caves (including the \u201cnew\u201d discovery) were examined in the 2002 book Subterranean Shropshire.\n\nSome outlets covered issues with trespassing that led to the closure of the caves in 2012, then again reported them as a new find in 2017. The 2012 stories noted that the caves were likely created as a Victorian-era \u201cfolly,\u201d and didn\u2019t tack on the connection to the Knights Templar (a Christian military order active between 1129 and 1312) for another few years. The Birmingham Mail took an extra step of replacing its 2012 coverage with the more mysterious 2017 version (archives remained), but other outlets did not.\n\nThat general description was repeated on an undated ShropshireHistory.com page, which says that the caves were a Victorian-era creation:\n\nThis is an underground folly cut out of sandstone to create a temple. It is not known when or why it as built but it was probably created as a folly in the mid-19th Century when this sort of thing was fashionable. The landowners used to allow the public to explore the temple but damage and litter caused by visitors finally made them seal up the entrance.\n\nAlthough the caves were reported as a new find in 2017, they were not new, not secret, and not widely thought to be more than a couple of centuries old.", "lang": "en"}
