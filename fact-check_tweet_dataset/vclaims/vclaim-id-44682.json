Andrew Cuomo. When Cuomo asked, \"When was the last time you saw the American military called out against Americans?\" Burnett responded, \"1807.\"\n\nFinally, she repeated it in an exchange with former CNN anchor Bernard Shaw.\n\nShe said that Trump would be \"invoking an act not invoked since 1807 to deploy U.S. military troops on American soil.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a problem, however. While the Insurrection Act was indeed passed and signed by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, it has been invoked many times since then, a reality that Burnett tweeted a correction after the show.\n\nThe 1807 law allows state governments to seek assistance from the federal government to put down insurrections. It also allows, in limited circumstances, the U.S. military to be deployed domestically without the consent of the state.\n\nThe consensual provision was last used in May 1992, amid riots in Los Angeles after the acquittals of officers charged with the beating of Rodney King, a black motorist. The assistance was requested by then-California Gov. Pete Wilson.\n\nThe provision that allows the president to override state officials has been invoked as well, historically to protect the civil rights of black Americans in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nPresidents Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy used these provisions in Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi to enforce civil rights laws, and Kennedy invoked it to send federal troops to Birmingham, Ala., during civil rights protests.\n\nAfter her show Burnett tweeted, \"I mistakenly said tonight that the insurrection act hasn\u2019t been invoked since 1807. That\u2019s incorrect. The last time it was used was 1992.\"\n\nBurnett said that if Trump decides to deploy the U.S. military domestically, he would be \"mobilizing U.S. military troops on American soil for the first time since 1807.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not correct. The law was passed in 1807, but it was last invoked in 1992.", "lang": "en"}
