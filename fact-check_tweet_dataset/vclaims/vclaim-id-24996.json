A third claim on revenue was also mostly correct, but a claim on healthcare budgets was incorrect. \n\n\n\nin which they laid out the achievements of the 47 county governments in agriculture, healthcare, infrastructure, budgeting and gender equality.\n\nbetween Kenya\u2019s senate and national assembly, at a time when the country was\n\nThe address was delivered by Wycliffe Oparanya, chair of the\n\n, two days before the end of the 2018/19 financial year. In the statement he celebrated that counties were allocating more money to development.\n\nBut do his claims add up?\n\nAfrica Check asked Ruth Chitwa, the council of governors\u2019 acting director of communications, for the source of the data. She referred us to the council\u2019s monitoring and evaluation team, who asked us to send an email with our queries. But despite repeated reminders, we have not yet received a response. (\n\nIn his address, Oparanya said the counties were aware of their crucial role in achieving food and nutrition security for Kenya, which was why they had increased funding for agriculture.\n\nBudget allocations for the 47 county governments are captured in reports by the\n\n, who authorises all government spending. The annual county budget implementation review report for the\n\nfinancial year and the latest\n\nfor 2018/19 contain each county\u2019s budget allocations to agriculture.\n\nFrom the reports\u2019 line item allocations to agriculture, we calculated that counties set aside\n\nof their budgets to agriculture in 2017/18, and\n\nin the first six months of 2018/19.\n\nThe most recent publicly available data shows that counties gave 6.3% of their total budgets to agriculture. Oparanya said the share was 6.7%. We rate his claim as mostly correct.\n\nIn 2004, 44 members of the\n\n\u201cat least 10% of their national budgets to agriculture.'' In the 2014\n\n, the AU upheld the commitment for \u201cat least 10% of public expenditure\u201d to go to agriculture. This was to boost economies and improve food security.\n\n, Oparanya said Kenyan counties could achieve the 10% investment in agriculture \u201cif the devolved monies held at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, are released to counties\u201d. Kenya\u2019s\n\nKSh23 billion to agriculture out of an estimated total budget of KSh411.6 billion \u2013 about 5.6%. A 10% allocation would have been KSh41.1 billion.\n\nto KSh29.1 billion (6.3%) out of a total of KSh462.1 billion. A 10% allocation would have been KSh46.2 billion.\n\nThis works out to a difference of just over three percentage points.\n\nBut the difference between the 2018/19 allocation of KSh29.1 billion and the Malabo aspiration of at least 10% of the total county budget (KSh46.2 billion) works out to a gap of 37%, not 3%.\n\nWe therefore rate Oparanya\u2019s claim as misleading.\n\nthat the number of health facilities rose from 9,858 in 2017 to 10,820 in 2018.\n\nOparanya referenced 2018 data, and the latest economic survey bears him out.\n\nThe numbers come from the\n\n, an inventory of the country\u2019s health facilities and community units. These are \u201cidentified with unique code and their details describing the geographical location, administrative location, ownership, type and the services offered\u201d.\n\nThe list can be sorted to show which facilities are operational and which are closed.\n\nAs at 18 July 2019 the\n\nKSh109.2 billion to health out of a total budget of KSh411.6 billion. This means\n\nKSh114.6 billion to health out of a budget of KSh462.1 billion, giving health a\n\nSo the total allocation to health for all the counties was above 20%.\n\nBut not all counties set aside at least 20% of their budgets for healthcare. In 2017/18 at least five counties allocated less than 20% to health. These were Kakamega (17.1%), Laikipia (13.4%), Taita Taveta (7.7%), Tana River (17.8%) and Turkana (11.6%).\n\nAnd in 2018/19, nine counties allocated less than 20% of their budgets to health. These were Baringo (2%), Kakamega (13%), Laikipia (13%), Mandera (18%), Nyandarua (11%), Taita Taveta (7%), Tana River (19%), Turkana (11%) and Wajir (17%).\n\nWe therefore rate the claim as incorrect.\n\nAfrica Check looked at the controller of budget\u2019s\n\nThe controller of budget approves the release of revenue from the consolidated fund to the counties.\n\ncounty figures and found that not all the money allocated to county governments was transferred to them. The controller of budget has\n\nbureaucratic, legal and technical reasons for this gap.\n\nLatest figures from the national treasury of\n\nas at 30 May 2019.\n\nLatest figures from the report of the controller of budget for the first nine months of 2018/19 as at 31 March 2019\n\n* Transfers in the first quarter under devolution prescribed by\n\nThe State of Devolution Address is dated 28 June 2019. The latest figures show that the treasury transferred KSh1.608 trillion to the counties between March 2013 and 30 May 2019. Up to 31 March 2019, the controller approved KSh1.514 trillion.\n\nThe amount actually received by counties is between KSh1.611 trillion and KSh1.514 trillion. Oparanya\u2019s claim of KSh1.57 trillion is within the ballpark. We therefore rate it as mostly correct.\n\nThe total shareable revenue from 2013 to 2019 is given in the\n\nThese add up to KSh7, 818 billion, or KSh7.8 trillion \u2013 the exact figure given by Oparanya.\n\nAccording to the treasury, the transfers to county governments as at 30 May 2019 add up to KSh1,611 billion. The controller of budget\u2019s report puts the amount approved for use by counties at KSh1,514 trillion up to 31 March 2019. These work out as 21% and 19% of the KSh7.8 trillion in total shareable revenue.\n\nOparanya was right on the money when he said the amount of national revenue transferred to the counties was equivalent to 20% of all the money the counties had received.\n\nthat \u201cover the medium term a minimum of 30% of the county government\u2019s budget shall be allocated to the development expenditure\u201d.

The development budget\u2019s share was highest in 2014/15, at 44%, and lowest in 2017/18, at 33.9%.\n\nThe average share is 40%.
