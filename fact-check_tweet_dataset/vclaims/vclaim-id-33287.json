Politiko's video even caught Drilon mentioning yesterday's date.\n\nThe fake report carried as its content a cropped, seven-second clip of journalist Jessica Soho reporting about an ambush, which stops before Soho is able to name the victim. The clip was grabbed from a seven-minute State of the Nation episode last Oct. 2 about the ambush and death of Sudipen, La Union mayor Alexander Buquing the day earlier.\n\nWhile the page loads, the fake story features 17 advertisements that take up more space than the actual content, proving true a claim made by Flemish application developer Maarten Schenk about how the volume of ads on a page says \"money is a big driver for these kinds of hoaxes.\"\n\nDeath hoaxes also easily generate quick clicks because such kinds of reports, Schenk explains, \"overwhelm the critical sense of people to some extent, leading them to act on emotion instead of reason.\"\n\nThe Drilon death hoax could have reached over 225,000 people, its biggest traffic generator from social media is the page News/Entertainment PH. It made the rounds on social media on Oct. 7,the same day Drilon opposed President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to appoint a former military officer to the Department of Social Welfare and Development.", "lang": "en"}
