Trump from advertising for his re-election campaign. This claim is false, Trump\u2019s advertising is still active on Facebook.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nOne post reads: \u201cFb is banning Trump from advertising for president so let\u2019s do it for him!!!! TRUMP 2020 !! FLOOD FB WITH THIS!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ads on Facebook are still active and can be found here .\n\nPolitical ads and speech by politicians are allowed on Facebook (their policy is visible here political and here ). This content, however, is not eligible for fact-checking ( here ).\n\nThe claim surfaced a few days after Facebook in August temporarily banned the political action committee (PAC), the Committee to Defend the President, from advertising due to repeated false posts ( here ).\n\n\u201cAs a result of the Committee to Defend the President\u2019s repeated sharing of content determined by third-party fact-checkers to be false, they will not be permitted to advertise for a period of time on our platform,\u201d Facebook spokesman Andy Stone had said in a statement ( here ).\n\nFacebook does not permit fact-checking of politicians\u2019 ads, but allows it for ads by political groups like PACs ( here ).\n\nFacebook has taken down posts and ads run by Trump\u2019s campaign in the past but did not ban it from advertising.\n\nIn June 2020, for example, Facebook took down ads run by Trump\u2019s re-election campaign for violating its policy against organized hate. The ads showed a red inverted triangle, a symbol the Nazis used to identify political prisoners, with text asking Facebook users to sign a petition against Antifa, a loosely organized anti-fascist movement ( here ).\n\nIn August 2020, Facebook removed a post by Trump for violating its coronavirus misinformation policies ( here ). The post contained a video clip, from an interview with Fox & Friends earlier in the day, in which Trump claimed that children are \u201calmost immune\u201d to COVID-19. Twitter and YouTube have also removed content by Trump for violating coronavirus misinformation policies.\n\nA combination of these recent events may have led to the confusion in these claims.\n\nFalse. Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has not been banned from advertising on Facebook.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
