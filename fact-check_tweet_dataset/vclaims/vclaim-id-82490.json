With 42 seats to the Lok Sabha, the state will be key to the fortunes of the BJP which is looking to make handsome inroads, and the TMC which aims to retain its stranglehold. Alongside the parties\u2019 campaigns, social media has witnessed a surge in misinformation related to the state. Alt News has put together a list of such instances.\n\n\u201cThe impact of MODI TSUNAMI \u2013 Mamata Banerjee appeals everyone to vote for BJP!\u201d \u2013 the official twitter handle of BJP Bengal declared in a tweet that the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Bannerji, appealed to vote for BJP in a rally. Accompanying the tweet was a short 18-second video in which her words \u2013 \u201cBJP shorkar ke vote diye\u201d \u2013 were played in a loop. The English translation of the statement is \u2013 \u201cvote for BJP\u201d.\n\nBJP Bengal had tweeted a doctored video, which was clipped and played in a loop to give a misleading impression. Mamata Banerjee had addressed a rally in Khanakul, West Bengal on April 23. While ending her speech, Banerjee asked the people to vote out BJP, with a sarcastic tone to her words. Banerjee\u2019s words \u201c6 May aasche din, ekhane bhalo kore gonotontroye BJP Sarkar ke vote diye bhalo kore kobor din, bhalo kore kobor din, bhalo kore kobor din\u201c, can be approximately translated as follows:\n\n\u201cOn May 6, cast your vote for BJP government and give them a proper burial, give them a proper burial, give them a proper burial\u201d.\n\nThe part where Banerjee says \u201cbhalo kore kobor din\u201c, which literally translates to \u201cput them in the grave\u201c, was clipped out by BJP Bengal. Instead, the part where Banerjee sarcastically says \u201cvote for BJP\u201d was retained and played in a loop.\n\n2. 2017 Gujarat video viral as \u201cRohingyas and Bangladeshi mistreat BJP workers in Bengal\u201d\n\nIn April 2019, a video went viral on social media with the claim that it depicts \u201cRohingyas and Bangladeshi refugees\u201d mistreating BJP workers when they passed by their settlements in West Bengal. \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote for the BJP, this will happen in the entire country very soon,\u201d read a warning shared along with the clip.\n\nAlt News had fact-checked the claim and found that the video pertained not to West Bengal but Gujarat. It was shot in 2017, when a scuffle had broken out among BJP workers in Surat ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s rally.\n\n3. Man dressed as Hanuman claimed to be West Bengal BJP candidate\n\nA TMC supporter tweeted photographs of a man dressed as Hanuman and said that he was \u201cJagannath Sarkar, BJP MP candidate from Ranaghat\u201d in West Bengal (archive). The claim was circulated widely on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe photographs viral on social media depicted the BJP\u2019s rally in West Bengal\u2019s Ranaghat constituency. Dilip Ghosh, president of the BJP WB unit, had shared the images on April 22 with the caption \u2013 \u201c\u09b0\u09be\u09a8\u09be\u0998\u09be\u099f \u09b2\u09cb\u0995\u09b8\u09ad\u09be \u0995\u09c7\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c7 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a5\u09c0 \u099c\u0997\u09a8\u09cd\u09a8\u09be\u09a5 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u0995\u09c7 \u09a8\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u09b0\u09cb\u09a1 \u09b6\u09cb (Roadshow with Ranaghat Lok Sabha constituency candidate Jagannath Sarkar).\u201d Ghosh had uploaded several photographs, including the ones where a man dressed as Hanuman can be seen seated atop a jeep. He was not Jagannath Sarkar, the BJP candidate.\n\nA video clip viral on social media was shared as a case of booth capturing in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls by \u201cBJP MP Brijesh Singh\u201d. The caption used to circulate the video was \u2013 \u201cBJP MP Brijesh Singh going with each voter to ensure vote for BJP. What reply does Modi have for this? This video has to go viral so that maximum people know what is happening.\u201d\n\nThe video was also circulated with a similar caption attacking the BJP. \u201cBJP \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u092f\u0915 \u0905\u0928\u093f\u0932 \u0909\u092a\u093e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f \u0915\u0940 \u0907\u0938 \u0939\u0930\u0915\u0924 \u092a\u0930 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0939\u0947\u0917\u0947 MODI \u091c\u0940, \u0907\u0938 video \u0915\u094b \u0907\u0924\u0928\u093e \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0932 \u0915\u0930\u094b \u0915\u0940 \u092f\u0947 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u093e \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0926\u0947\u0916 \u0938\u0915\u0947 (Modi ji, what is your comment on BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay\u2019s act? Make this video so viral that the whole of India watches it.)\u201d The video had also been attributed to the TMC.\n\nAlt News found that this video was circulating with false claims on social media, although the incident had indeed taken place in West Bengal. Moreover, the names of the MP/MLA which were used in the viral messages- Brijesh Singh and Anil Upadhyay- are fictitious.\n\nBJP\u2019s Krishnanagar candidate Kalyan Chaubey, a former Indian football player, tweeted a video of two men assaulting a woman and subsequently hacking another man with a sickle. He claimed that the perpetrators were \u201cTMC goons\u201d and the man who was ruthlessly attacked was \u201cBJP worker Sagar Roy\u201d from West Bengal. Chaubey later deleted his tweet but not before it received nearly 30,000 views in less than two hours.\n\nSeveral users had pointed out in the comments that the video was not from West Bengal but from Bhagalpur, Bihar. Alt News corroborated this information with local media reports. The video depicted an incident that took place on April 16. A father, along with his younger son, hacked his elder son to death with a sickle, reported Prabhat Khabar.\n\n6. False claim of a Brahmin beaten up by Muslims\n\nA video of a crowd of people thrashing a man dressed in white was circulated on social media with the claim that a Brahmin was attacked by Muslims in West Bengal.\n\n\u201cMuslims beating one Brahman in WB in front of his daughter. During Pooja in his house, the bell sound should not be heard by anybody. This is common in West Bengal in Muslim dominated areas. No media is covering the atrocities on Hindus. Whereas human rights wings are crying for shelter of Rohangya [Rohingya] Muslims in India,\u201d is the caption used to share the video. On Twitter, the same incident recorded from a different angle and a different spot is in circulation.\n\nThe claim that a Brahmin was beaten by Muslims to stop him from praying is false. The same message was debunked by the Kolkata police in a series of tweets when it was viral in 2017. According to the police\u2019s statement, the man was a Hindu priest who allegedly molested a woman and was manhandled by her family as a consequence.\n\nIn May 2019, a video circulated on social media platforms claimed that devotees of the Krishna cult, ISKCON were prevented by West Bengal police from distributing copies of the Bhagwad Gita. The video showed men in saffron robes being manhandled by men in khaki uniform.\n\nAlt News found that the video has been online since at least 2008. According to an article, the said incident had taken place in Goa, wherein a group of Russian members of the Hare Rama Hare Krishna sect had clashed with the police after the latter tried to stop them following complaints by the locals.\n\n8. Fake newspaper clip with fake quote of Mamata Banerjee\n\nA purported newspaper clipping of popular Bengali daily \u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 (Bartaman) was shared on social media with its headline reading, \u201c\u09ea\u09e8\u099f\u09be \u0986\u09b8\u09a8 \u09a6\u09bf\u09a8 \u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09c1 \u0995\u09c0\u09ad\u09be\u09ac\u09c7 \u0995\u09be\u0981\u09a6\u09be \u09a4\u09c7 \u09b9\u09df \u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac: \u09ae\u09ae\u09a4\u09be (Give me 42 seats & I\u2019ll show you how to make the Hindus cry: Mamata)\u201d The image had also circulated on WhatsApp.\n\nAlt News found that the image was photoshopped. A careful glance at the clipping was sufficient to reveal that the image has been morphed. The font, size and colour of the words \u201c\u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09c1 (Hindu)\u201d and \u201c\u0995\u09be\u0981\u09a6\u09be \u09a4\u09c7 (cry)\u201d do not match the words in the rest of the sentence. They are not in perfect alignment, are larger than the other words and are in a deeper shade of black. Moreover, some words were replaced from the original image.\n\n9. Mike in hands of TMC leader claimed to be gun\n\nA video clip posted by Twitter user Chowkidar Piyush (@piyushsinghk) was shared with the claim that it depicts a TMC leader pulling out a gun during a live debate. Piyush is followed by railway minister Piyush Goyal and BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga.\n\nSeveral people commented on Piyush\u2019s tweet that the TMC leader had picked up a mike and not pulled out a gun. A careful analysis of the video revealed that this was indeed true. The live debate was organised by Zee Newsin West Bengal\u2019s Cooch Behar. The TMC leader who lost his cool and picked up a mike was state minister Rabindra Nath Ghosh. He did not brandish a gun, as claimed.\n\nSeveral constituencies of West Bengal will vote in the final two phases of the election, on May 12 and May 19. It is thus no surprise that the misinformation machinery has kicked in right on the eve of polling, in a bid to polarize the electorate. These instances are merely illustrative and by no means exhaustive. More such examples are likely to crop up as the polling date draws near.\n\nUpdate: The article has been updated to include more instances.", "lang": "en"}
