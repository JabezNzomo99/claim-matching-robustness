Sean Duffy (R-Wausau) wants states to be able to refuse Medicaid funds to health centers that provide abortions, so in January 2017, the Wisconsin Republican reintroduced legislation to do just that \u2014 a bill called the Women\u2019s Public Health and Safety Act.\n\nFederal dollars currently cannot go toward abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the mother\u2019s life. But providers that offer abortions can still receive Medicaid dollars for other medical services, such as tests for sexually transmitted diseases and cancer screenings.\n\nIn a Jan. 24, 2017 news release announcing the legislation, Duffy claimed: \"New evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions.\"\n\nIt\u2019s an intriguing statement: The bill hits on a divisive issue in American politics \u2014 abortion \u2014 and Duffy\u2019s news release provided no supporting information to back-up the claim.\n\nWhen we asked Duffy for details, spokesman Mark Bednar cited a video that an anti-abortion group released in January 2017 asserting, in short, that few Planned Parenthood facilities offer prenatal care. (Planned Parenthood, which has about 650 health centers across the country, including 21 in Wisconsin, disputes the video\u2019s conclusions.)\n\nBednar also provided estimates of Planned Parenthood's U.S. market share for abortions and how much money the group makes by performing abortions.\n\nWe reviewed everything Duffy\u2019s team supplied and none of it came close to justifying the claim that \"new evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions.\"\n\nSo let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nAt the outset, we note that Planned Parenthood provides a wide variety of health services, not just abortions, according to the group\u2019s 2014-2015 annual report, the most recent one available.\n\nThose other services include contraception, hormone therapy, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy tests, cancer screenings and prevention procedures, as well as smoking cessation assistance.\n\nTo fully evaluate Duffy\u2019s claim, though, we need to get a sense of the relative frequency of the abortions Planned Parenthood provides and how it compares to other services, and there are different ways of measuring that.\n\nPlanned Parenthood performed nearly 324,000 abortions in the 12-month period between October 2013 and September 2014, according to the group\u2019s annual report.\n\nThat\u2019s out of a total 9.4 million services provided to patients in the same time period, including:\n\nThe upshot is that abortions accounted for about 3 percent of all Planned Parenthood\u2019s procedures and services, the annual report states.\n\nCritics and some observers have questioned whether the 3 percent figure accurately reflects the proportion of abortion services at Planned Parenthood centers.\n\nThat\u2019s because the calculation used to arrive at the number doesn\u2019t distinguish between types of services, their cost or complexity. In other words, one abortion is counted the same as providing a contraceptive or pregnancy test.\n\nBut there is a second, perhaps more objective way of assessing Duffy\u2019s claim: look at patients.\n\nPlanned Parenthood had about 2.5 million patients in the 12-month period covered in its annual report, from October 2013 to September 2014. About 13 percent of patients had abortions in that time frame, according to Elizabeth Clark, director of health media for Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n\nPut another way: 87 percent of patients visited Planned Parenthood for non-abortion needs.\n\nWe recognize, of course, that Planned Parenthood has self-reported these figures from their affiliates. Still, the numbers are independently audited, Clark said, and we are not aware of any other sources that can reliably provide the same kind of information.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that because federal dollars generally can\u2019t be used for abortions, Duffy\u2019s bill and other legislation aimed at restricting public funding for Planned Parenthood are themselves an acknowledgment of sorts that the organization does more than provide abortions.\n\nIndeed, Planned Parenthood\u2019s single-largest share of revenue in fiscal year 2015 \u2014 $553 million, or 43 percent \u2014 came from government grants and reimbursements, according to the annual report.\n\nDuffy said, \"New evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions.\"\n\nBut that is far from accurate.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s most recent annual report covering a 12-month span between October 2013 and September 2014 states that abortions accounted for 3 percent of services the organization provided.\n\nAbout 13 percent of Planned Parenthood patients had abortions in the same period, a spokeswoman said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Duffy\u2019s own measure to defund Planned Parenthood underlines how inaccurate this claim is. Federal money generally can\u2019t be used for abortions, so the money he and others want to eliminate goes to pay for, well, things other than abortions.\n\nFor a claim that\u2019s false and ridiculous, we have one rating: Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
