I\u2019m the only one here that I think that\u2019s ever started a business. Is that fair?\u201d\n\nTwo seconds passed, and no one else on the stage answered. Bloomberg said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and moved on.\n\nThe video takes that minor moment and stretches it to 22 seconds, with reaction shots that make the other candidates look troubled, embarrassed or confused. The video is silent except for cricket sounds. These were all taken from other moments in the debate. For instance, with the help of Elyse Samuels of The Post video team, we identified:\n\u2022 None Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), when she was under fire from former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg for not remembering the name of the president of Mexico.\n\u2022 None Buttigieg, when he was being lectured by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) after Buttigieg described him as polarizing: \u201cThat\u2019s what we are saying, Pete, is maybe it\u2019s a time for the working class of this country to have a little bit of power in Washington, rather than your billionaire campaign contributors.\u201d\n\u2022 None Sanders, in a reaction shot from the very start of the debate, as moderator Lester Holt called him \u201ca self-described democratic socialist [who] has surged into the lead nationally in the Democratic race.\u201d\n\nThis is a case of what our guide labels as \u201cDeceptive Editing,\u201d specifically a subcategory of \u201cOmission\u201d: \u201cEditing out large portions from a video and presenting it as a complete narrative, despite missing key elements, is a technique used to skew reality.\u201d\n\nTwitter has announced that starting March 5, it will label \u201csynthetic or manipulated video\u201d or even remove tweets if they could cause harm. A Twitter official told The Washington Post that the Bloomberg video would probably have a label attached to it if it had been tweeted after the policy went into effect.\n\nMore than 2 million people had watched the video seven hours after it had been posted, so this is not a minor matter.\n\nPolitical ads can be fun and entertaining, but they shouldn\u2019t be misleading. Anyone who had not seen the debate could have been easily misled into thinking the other candidates stood there in stunned silence for nearly half a minute.\n\nWe\u2019re taking a tough line on manipulated campaign videos before viewers are flooded with so many fakes that they have trouble knowing what is true. The Bloomberg campaign should label this as a parody or else take the video down.", "lang": "en"}
