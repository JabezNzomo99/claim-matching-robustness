The image makes the further claim that in March, Cuomo said that the state lacked resources \u201cto care for our own citizens during a crisis\u201d, likely referring to the Governor\u2019s call for ventilators and other medical supplies to treat overwhelming numbers of coronavirus patients ( here ).\n\nThe image claim comes amid plans to begin reopening businesses and schools in New York, one of the states hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic ( here ).\n\nThe first part of the claim relating to resources for illegals is false. The second part is true. Cuomo did say the state was overwhelmed amidst the coronavirus crisis in March.\n\nOn January 8, 2020, Cuomo outlined his 2020 agenda during a \u201cState of the State\u201d address, providing insight into his plans for future healthcare spending ( here ). Two weeks later, Cuomo outlined New York state\u2019s fiscal year 2021 budget ( here ). The executive briefing book on the budget makes no mention of extending benefits to undocumented immigrants, except in the context of the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented individuals to have access to certain kinds of academic scholarships ( here ).\n\nCuomo\u2019s budget proposal was criticized for seeking billions of dollars in savings for the state by cutting $2.5 billion in Medicaid spending, the New York Times reported in January ( here ). The move by Cuomo was designed to address the state\u2019s long-standing budgetary crisis.\n\nNew York health organizations commended Cuomo\u2019s proposal for paid sick leave, but warned that the Governor\u2019s health plans fell short, in part because of their exclusion of \u201cundocumented adults\u201d, ( here ). A statement by health advocates, labor and community members expressed their concern for the fact that Cuomo \u201cdid not support the New York Health Act single payer bill or legislation to expand insurance coverage to all New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status (S.3900/A.5974).\u201d\n\nNew York state\u2019s Essential Plan, launched in 2016 as an affordable health insurance option for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers and covered in the Governor\u2019s budget, also does not cover individuals with an irregular immigration status, per their official eligibility requirements ( here ). In New York City, immigrants who are undocumented and not pregnant can qualify for Medicaid for emergency services ( here ).\n\nLast year, New York state passed the so-called Green Light law allowing illegal immigrants to apply for driver\u2019s licenses, triggering the Trump administration to ban New Yorkers from federal programs that help travelers speed through airport security lines and borders ( here ).\n\nIn March 2020, Cuomo publicly discussed the state\u2019s overwhelmed healthcare system, as well as shortages in essential medical supplies and ventilators. In mid-March, New York was the global epicenter of the new coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. Scarcities of protective masks, gloves, gowns and eyewear for doctors and nurses had emerged as a national problem not limited to New York ( here ).\n\n\u201cOur nurses across the country do not have the personal protective equipment that is necessary to care for COVID patients, or any of their patients,\u201d Bonnie Castillo, head of the largest U.S. nurses union, National Nurses United, told MSNBC.\n\nIn an April 3 live stream, Cuomo said \u201cNew York is in crisis\u201d, in discussions pertaining to coronavirus response ( here ). In late March, he called for healthcare workers elsewhere to help the state\u2019s overwhelmed hospitals battle the coronavirus. \u201cPlease come help us in New York now,\u201d Cuomo told a briefing at the temporary hospital erected at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan also in March. \u201cWe need relief,\u201d he added. ( here )\n\nIn January 2020, Cuomo released his budget proposal for fiscal year 2021, which planned cuts to healthcare spending and largely excluded coverage for undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn March 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuomo discussed New York State\u2019s overwhelmed healthcare system and shortage of essential supplies. Shortages of protective personal equipment for healthcare workers was reported as a national problem.\n\nPartly false. In January 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo did not say that the state had \u201cample resources to provide healthcare to illegals\u201d. In March and April, New York\u2019s healthcare system was under extreme pressure from the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
