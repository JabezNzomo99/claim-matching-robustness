Through this article lets fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Rajdeep Sardesai being heckled after his latest interview with Rhea Chakraborty. Fact: The incident in the video took place in 2014 when Narendra Modi made his first official visit to the US after he got elected as the Indian Prime Minister.
