Ted Cruz, R-Texas, lately have aired similar concerns about the future of working-class Americans, though they differ over what to do.\n\nIn his , the Democratic president said he wants to work with Congress to offer free community college to students while creating other education, child care and retirement savings programs to help the middle class. Funding, he\u2019s proposed, would come from a $320 billion tax increase on the nation\u2019s highest earners and financial institutions including investment banks.\n\nAfter Obama\u2019s speech, Cruz told Fox News he was disappointed with Obama\u2019s goals to increase government spending and taxes, which he described as hurting hardworking Americans.\n\nThen Cruz said the country\u2019s rich and powerful \"have gotten fat and happy\" on Obama\u2019s watch. \"Today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our national income than any year since 1928,\" Cruz said.\n\nAnd was Cruz right?\n\nBy email, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack indicated Cruz does not agree with Obama, who said in his speech he wants to reduce the top 1 percent\u2019s after-tax income. Novack said Cruz, rather than increase taxes on the wealthy, believes the only way to \" is by championing pro-growth policies like energy development and a .\"\n\nAnd, Novack said, Cruz drew his comparison to 1928 from by the Pew Research Center citing research by , a University of California, Berkeley economics professor who studies wealth and income inequality.\n\nSaez helps steer the , sponsored by the Paris School of Economics, a research center and conglomerate of French universities offering graduate degrees and post-graduate fellowships in economics.\n\nThe database, in place since 2011, shows the distribution of top incomes for more than 20 countries using data from millions of tax returns collected over about 100 years. By email, Saez said he and economists including built the database from sources including public-use files of individual tax returns. The public-use micro-files are blurred to preserve each payer\u2019s confidentiality, Saez said.\n\nTo check on changes over time for ourselves, we built a chart from .\n\nThe resulting data, covering 1913, the earliest checkable year, to 2012, shows 1928 and 2012 to be the top two years where the top 1 percent of the richest Americans (the richest of the rich) earned the greatest share of the nation\u2019s income, which into 15 categories including wages, salaries and self-employment income plus income from dividends and interest.\n\nIn 1928, the top 1 percent of earners, then comprised of about 1.2 million residents, together held 19.6 percent of the nation\u2019s income. In 2008, the year Obama was elected president, the top 1 percent possessed nearly 18 percent. The 1 percent collectively saw its share of the nation\u2019s income escalate nearly 5 percent through the first three years of Obama\u2019s presidency. And in his fourth year, 2012, the 1 percent (nearly 314 million residents) controlled 19.34 percent. According to the database, that was the greatest share these wealthiest Americans had held since 1928, as Cruz said. (No. 3 goes to 1927, when the top 1 percent had 18.7 percent of U.S. income.)\n\nTop 15 years the richest American taxpayers had the greatest share of U.S. income\n\nBy email, Saez told us Obama and Congress (which shifted to Republican control in his tenure) did little to address wealth inequality up until 2012 as the country recovered from the Great Recession -- which officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009.\n\nIn a , Saez wrote that in 2012, average real incomes per family in the top 1 percent of earners nationally increased by 19.6 percent, while average incomes among the rest of us grew 1 percent. The report said the entire surge in top 1 percent incomes in 2012 could be a result of income re-timing -- when people hold off on making payments so they can report a higher income to take advantage of lower tax rates.\n\nBy email, Saez said he expects the top 1 percent\u2019s income share for 2014 to prove slightly lower than in 2012 as a result of tax increases approved by Congress and Obama in 2013 raising the nation\u2019s marginal income-tax rate from 35 to 39.6 percent for married couples earning more than $450,000 annually, starting in 2013. That deal, which also whittled tax deductions for high-earning businesses and individuals, helped the government avoid , a term describing the looming impact of tax cuts initiated by President George W. Bush expiring at the end of 2012 at the same time congressionally mandated spending reductions were due to kick in.\n\nThe World Top Incomes Database and Saez\u2019s work have become popular sources for to cite when discussing income and wealth inequality. Still, some experts have raised doubts about what goes into the Piketty-Saez inequality measurements.\n\nBy email, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said the Saez-Piketty data understate income growth by the bottom 99 percent. That is, he noted, Piketty and Saez limit their focus to pre-tax private income including wages, self-employment earnings, dividends, interest, rental payments and, in some cases, capital gains.\n\nThe result, Burtless said, is the database doesn\u2019t consider other sources of income such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps, government reimbursement of medical bills and untaxed fringe benefits such as employer contributions to health and retirement plans. \"If we include these income items, the bottom 99 percent of income recipients has enjoyed much faster increases in income\" than what\u2019s \"shown by Piketty and Saez,\" Burtless wrote.\n\nBurtless suggested the best statistics on U.S. income inequality come from the nonpartisan . \"That's because CBO constructs 3 measures of income -- \u2018gross market income,\u2019 \u2018pretax income\u2019 (gross market income plus cash and no cash government transfers), and \u2018after-tax income\u2019 (pre-tax income minus federal income, payroll, and excise taxes),\" Burtless said in his email.\" CBO data indicates that from 2009 to 2010, the top 1 percent\u2019s share of income increased from 13.3 percent to 14.9 percent. (To refresh, Piketty and Saez say their research shows the top 1 percent\u2019s share of income escalating from 16.68 percent to 17.45 percent.)\n\nNext, we talked to Robert Litan, another economist with the Brookings Institution, about why income inequality escalated so quickly in Obama\u2019s first term. By email, Litan said reasons for the rising share of the top 1 percent\u2019s income include \"rising CEO pay relative to workers, extraordinary success of tech entrepreneurs in particular, made possible by Internet + globalization, and successful financiers, especially hedge fund managers.\" A by the liberal Economic Policy Institute also highlights inequality in earnings and compensation between CEOs and typical workers.\n\nBurtless and Litan also told us by email Congress and Obama could not have done much to affect the percentage increase of the top 1 percent\u2019s income based on Piketty-Saez measurements. \"The Congress and president have a bigger direct impact on after-tax income than on pre-tax income because their decisions directly affect the tax burdens and government transfer payments of families in different positions in the income distribution,\" Burtless said.\n\nCruz said: \"Today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our national income than any year since 1928.\"\n\nCruz accurately recapped calculations of income by respected researchers though this statement fails to note there are some income streams not part of the cited calculations that would tend to help those of us in the bottom 99 percent, relatively speaking. Also, tax changes that took effect in 2013 may slightly be reducing how much of the nation\u2019s income is held by the top 1 percent.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
