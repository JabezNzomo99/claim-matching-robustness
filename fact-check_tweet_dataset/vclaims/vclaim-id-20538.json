By the way, in certain aspects of the index, Moscow is among the top three: digital services in the interactions between the state and the citizens \u2013 actually first place, simply first place in the world,\u201d Putin said.\n\nAlthough the Russian leader did not specify which ranking he was referring to, it seems that he was citing a report by the Moscow branch of the British consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), released last week.\n\nThe Russian-language PwC-Russia report is headlined: \u201cThe future is near: an index of cities\u2019 preparedness.\u201d It places Moscow in the top position among the world\u2019s mega-cities, ahead of London, New York, Hong Kong and Toronto.\n\nAccording to PwC-Russia, Moscow is in first place when it comes to \u201cvirtual services,\u201d second place when it comes to \u201cinfrastructure readiness,\u201d and third place in terms of both \u201cdigital economy\u201d and \u201copen adaptive education.\u201d\n\nStill, Moscow won only fifth place in the overall ranking, with Singapore in first place, followed by London, Shanghai and New York City.\n\nThere are however, several red flags in the report itself, as well as in the background of the PwC office in Russia.\n\nFirst of all, every page of the Russian-language version of the PwC report that includes any sort of ranking has a footnote which reads: \u201cThe information is in the process of verification.\u201d That means the findings were inconclusive, or that the company decided to leave open a window for flexibility. Both possibilities, according to the experts consulted by Polygraph.info, undermine the objectivity and authority of the report.\n\nSecondly, the English version of the same report, which is headlined \u201cData-driven city,\u201d is significantly different from the Russian version, both in terms of their structure and their findings.\n\nThe English version uses different evaluation categories than the Russian one, making it impossible to compare their respective rankings. Moreover, unlike the Russian version, the English version includes no ranking charts, which raises further doubts regarding the \u201cverification\u201d footnotes in the Russian report.\n\nPwC explained that in comparing the cities around the world, the company used various sources of information, including the city governments' own press releases.\n\nIn the charts comparing the cities \u201cby the results of the semantic analysis\u201d (pages 8-9), Moscow stands among cities with a disproportionally large \u201cpink ball\u201d \u2013 where pink indicates that PwC has relied primarily on city government press releases for its analysis, while in the cases of other cities, \u201cred\u201d and \u201corange\u201d balls are significantly larger than the pink ones. In the study, \u201cred\u201d stands for \u201ctechnology news\u201d and \u201corange\u201d stands for \u201cscientific articles.\u201d This again raises questions about the accuracy of a ranking conducted with such an unequal representation of data.\n\nThirdly, according to the Moscow city government\u2019s website, PwC is a government contractor involved in a 129.5 million ruble ($2.1 million) program called Moscow\u2019s Strategy for Socio-Economic Development. The project was launched in 2011 and is scheduled to run until 2025.\n\nPwC-Russia is reportedly involved in multiple other government contracts, including the one reached in 1995 with the government-owned gas and oil giant Gazprom.\n\nMeanwhile, other internationally recognized Independent rankings of world cities have had results that are not so flattering for Moscow.\n\nThe Business Insider\u2019s 2016 ranking of the 25 most high-tech cities in the world placed Moscow in 16th place.\n\nOn the other hand, the 2017 Quality of Living City Rankings by Mercer, the world's largest human resources consulting firm, which ranked 450 of the world\u2019s cities, put Moscow in 168th place.\n\nMercer applied most of the criteria used by PwC-Russia in its own rankings, which placed Moscow in the top three positions in the world.", "lang": "en"}
