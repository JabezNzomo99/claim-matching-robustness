On Jan. 13, the cannabis and drug industry website Merry Jane published an article with the headline \u201cA Cocaine Nasal Spray Just Received FDA Approval.\u201d That article reported that:\n\nMedicinal cocaine has always been a thing, but now there\u2019s an FDA-approved nasal spray aptly made with totally legal, pharmaceutical-grade white. On Monday, the pharmaceutical outfit Lannett Company announced that its new cocaine hydrochloride nasal spray product, dubbed Numbrino, cleared two Phase III, randomized, double-blind clinical trials. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s approval of our cocaine HCl product, the first NDA approval to include full clinical trials in the company\u2019s history, marks a major milestone in Lannett\u2019s 70+ years of operations,\u201d said Tim Crew, Lannett Company\u2019s CEO, in a press release. \u201cWe believe the product has the potential to be an excellent option for the labeled indication. We expect to launch the product shortly \u2026\u201d\n\nThe pharmaceutical company\u2019s press release, also published on Jan. 13, read as follows:\n\n\u201cLannett Company, Inc. today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the New Drug Application (NDA), submitted under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, for Cocaine Hydrochloride (HCl) Nasal Solution 4% (40 mg/mL), the company\u2019s branded local anesthetic product \u2026 NUMBRINO\u00ae (cocaine hydrochloride) nasal solution is an ester local anesthetic indicated for the introduction of local anesthesia of the mucous membranes for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through the nasal cavities of adults.\u201d\n\nThe press release, and Merry Jane\u2019s article, were accurate. In a Jan. 10 letter addressed to Cody Laboratories, a subsidiary of the Philadelphia-headquartered Lannett, the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research wrote:\n\n\u201c[Your] new drug application provides for the use of NUMBRINO for the introduction of local anesthesia of the mucous membranes for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through the nasal cavities of adults \u2026 We have completed our review of this application, as amended. It is approved, effective on the date of this letter, for use as recommended in the enclosed agreed-upon labeling.\u201d\n\nNumbrino does indeed contain cocaine hydrochloride, the drug commonly abused for recreational purposes, but an FDA spokesperson explained to Snopes in a statement that the manner of its deployment as a local anesthetic was designed to safeguard against dependency:\n\n\u201cCocaine hydrochloride nasal solution contains cocaine, a Schedule II substance with a high potential for abuse. However, when used according to the directions provided in the labeling, physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms are unlikely to develop because this drug is for single use during diagnostic procedures and surgeries. To minimize these risks, the labeling suggests that health care facilities using the drug implement effective accounting procedures, in addition to routine procedures for handling controlled substances. Notably, this will be used as an anesthetic by trained health care professionals during diagnostic procedures and surgeries, not by patients directly. It is not available by prescription.\u201d\n\nNumbrino is not the first local anesthetic containing cocaine to be approved by the FDA. In 2017, the agency approved a cocaine hydrochloride product called Goprelto which, like Numbrino, is also intended for use as a painkiller during surgeries and procedures in the nasal cavities.", "lang": "en"}
