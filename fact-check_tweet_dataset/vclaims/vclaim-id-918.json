The claim is true up until the 1930s. But data show that Northern Ireland has run a fiscal deficit since 1966. The most recent figure, from 2013-14, is a subvention of \u00a39.2 billion.\n\nThe UUP\u2019s 2016 manifesto states: \u201cThere was a time when we were net contributors to Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury, now Stormont is dependent on an annual \u00a311 billion subvention from Westminster every year.\u201d\n\nThis claim is based off Professor Bob Rowthorn\u2019s research, which describes how when Northern Ireland was created it was seen as \u201can integral and self-supporting component of Britain\u2019s Imperial system\u201d, generating a fiscal surplus. Thus a regular \u201cImperial Contribution\u201d was paid by the province, until the economic crises of the 1930s.\n\nNorthern Ireland residents pay taxes directly to the UK Government. The UK Government then allocates the funding to its departments and the devolved administrations. The taxes generated within Northern Ireland are considerably less than the level of funding received from HM Treasury \u2014 the shortfall made up by a subvention.\n\nFigures published by Ulster University\u2019s Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) show how subvention rose from the period of 1966-1993. Subvention was first recorded as costing \u00a352 million annually (\u00a3489 million in 1992 prices), rising to \u00a33.34 billion by 1996-97.\n\nFurther figures are provided by the Net Fiscal Balance report, produced by the Department of Finance (UK). The latest estimate, for 2013-14, is a fiscal deficit of \u00a39.2 billion.\n\nHM Treasury is responsible for managing and implementing UK fiscal and macroeconomic policy, as well as determining public expenditure allocations across the UK regions. As a result, Northern Ireland\u2019s Budget, along with that for Scotland and Wales, continues to be determined within the framework of public expenditure control in the UK.\n\nImage: \u201cFifties\u201d by William Warby is licensed by CC BY 2.0\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
