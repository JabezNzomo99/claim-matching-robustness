For individuals, the top tax bracket would likely drop from nearly 40 percent to 35 percent, and the bottom tax rate will increase from 10 percent to 12 percent.\n\nMr. Trump also claimed in his remarks that he \"may\" visit the Philippines during an overseas visit to various Asian countries. The White House however, released a detailed itinerary of Mr. Trump's visit, which confirmed his participation in various bilateral meetings with controversial Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nAccording to a White House statement on the trip, while in the Philippines, the president will participate in the Special Gala Celebration Dinner for the 50th Anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). He is also set to celebrate the 40th anniversary of U.S.-ASEAN relations at the U.S.-ASEAN Summit.", "lang": "en"}
