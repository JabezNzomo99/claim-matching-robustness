After all, what brand wants to be linked to a virus which is killing people worldwide?\"\n\nNot long after the press release was sent, major news outlets started amplifying the alleged findings, and amateur Twitter pundits started spinning the results:\n\nAt one point, Corona (and its owner, Grupo Modelo) was the subject of three separate trending topics on Twitter.\n\nThe basics: The lime-loving lager is named for the Sun\u2019s corona. COVID-19\u2019s \u201ccorona\u201d alias refers to the crownlike appearance of the pathogen when viewed under a microscope.\n\nSo how can it be that 38 percent of Americans are afraid of a Mexican beer giving them coronavirus? Short answer: They aren\u2019t. What we have is a flawed survey that generated a series of misleading hot takes.\n\n\u201cThis is not a well-done (or reported) survey,\u201d Glen Bolger\u2014co-founder of the survey research firm Public Opinion Strategies\u2014told The Dispatch in an email.\n\nThe public relations firm behind the poll\u20145WPR\u2014shared its methodology with The Dispatch. It reached 737 American \u201cbeer-drinkers\u201d on the phone earlier this week, asking them the following:\n\u2022 None Is Corona related to the coronavirus?\n\u2022 None In light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona?\n\u2022 None Would you buy Corona in a store?\n\u2022 None Would you order a Corona in a restaurant/bar/public venue?\n\u2022 None Would you buy Corona under any circumstances now?\n\n5WPR would not provide the individual results to each of these questions, but its press release includes some partial data. First, the firm reports that \u201c38 percent of beer-drinking Americans would not buy Corona under any circumstances now.\u201d And second, according to the release: \u201cOnly 4 percent\u201d of respondents who said they usually drink Corona would stop.\n\nThe response that has been making the headlines\u2014that 38 percent won\u2019t buy Corona now\u2014does not mention the virus anywhere in the question. At best, the survey indicates the percentage of people who have a negative opinion of Corona beer\u2014but it doesn\u2019t elucidate why they won\u2019t buy it. The same could be said for each of the last three questions, in fact.\n\n\u201cThis is really a dumb use of data,\u201d Dan Judy, a methodologist at North Star Opinion Research, told The Dispatch. \u201c38 percent of all beer-drinking Americans wouldn't buy Corona under any circumstances now? Well guess what! I wouldn't buy it under any circumstances\u2014because I don't drink it! So, the headline is massively misleading.\u201d\n\nTwo questions did mention the coronavirus, though. If a statistically significant number of the 737 beer-drinking respondents said they were Corona drinkers in the second question, and of those, 4 percent said they would stop drinking it \u201cin light of the coronavirus,\u201d that would be an accurate headline.\n\nBut even if all that is true\u2014and what 5WPR released doesn\u2019t make clear that it is\u2014that\u2019s \u201ca tiny, tiny number of people,\u201d Judy said. \u201cWhich is why they didn't report it that way.\u201d\n\nThe coronavirus\u2019 notoriety could possibly be having an impact on the Mexican beer brand\u2014a YouGov survey found Corona\u2019s \u201cBuzz score\u201d has sharply fallen since the first COVID-19 case was discovered a few months ago\u2014but 5WPR\u2019s poll is deeply flawed, and it\u2019s misleading to report, as CNN and others have, that \u201c38 percent of Americans wouldn't buy Corona \u2018under any circumstances\u2019 because of the outbreak.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\nBottom line, from North Star\u2019s Judy: \u201cIt's a sensational, inaccurate, and flat-out dumb thing to say that is not based in the data at all.\u201d\n\nPhoto of Corona beer bottles by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
