Yet, while there is clear evidence that Ford actually said this statement, that\u2019s not the case for the expression attributed to him in the Facebook post.\n\nThe DCNF keyword-searched the Henry Ford Museum\u2019s digital archive for the statement, but found nothing resembling it. It also doesn\u2019t appear in his autobiography \u201cMy Life and Work.\u201d\n\nThough the Henry Ford Museum doesn\u2019t comment on the veracity of alleged quotes as a matter of policy, the phrase is notably absent from the museum\u2019s list of more than 200 verified quotations.\n\nEtymologist Barry Popik traced a variation of the expression \u2013 \u201cIf you want to consider what \u2018social security\u2019 does for and to people look at the American Indian\u201d \u2013 back to a 1935 column in The Evening Tribune newspaper. Citations that more closely resemble the quote have appeared from 1950 onward.\n\nFor instance, one appears in May 1950 edition of a Boston newspaper, where the author wrote, \u201cObserves a cynic: \u2018If you think you\u2019re going to be happy and prosperous by sitting back and letting the government take care of you, look at the American Indian.'\u201d\n\nThe earliest known attribution to Ford doesn\u2019t come until the 2000s, according to Popik. It\u2019s unclear how or why the expression came to be associated with him.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
