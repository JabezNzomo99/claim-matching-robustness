According to the channel, two Dalit groups fought over a government-owned plot of land where a building was being constructed. One of the groups opposed the construction as it would occupy free space in the village used for functions such as weddings. \u201cThe villagers broke down the wall around the land. A man named Lalchand tried to grab the government-owned land and the villagers took down the wall,\u201d said the report.\n\nThe conflict was between a group led by Lalchand and another group which opposed the construction. The police told ABP News that about 200 people came to the police station and grew violent. \u201cThe group that was constructing the building comprised of Dalits and so did the other group,\u201d they added.\n\nMedia outlet UttarPradesh.org had also reported the incident. \u201cAn enraged crowd pelted stones at Gagaha police station after a residence was being illegally constructed on a piece of government land. Police shot rubber bullets to control the crowd. Three villagers and some policemen were reportedly injured.\u201d\n\nThe police gave similar details to the media and said that 13 people were arrested.\n\nAccording to Patrika, villagers were frustrated with the police who did not pay heed to multiple complaints of illegal construction on the plot of land. On May 15, 2018, a group pelted stones at Gagaha police station when the construction finally began.\n\nA conflict between two Dalit groups over construction on a plot of government land was revived on social media with a communal angle. The claim that upper-caste community clashed with Dalits in a Gorakhpur village is false. Moreover, the incident is nearly two years old.", "lang": "en"}
