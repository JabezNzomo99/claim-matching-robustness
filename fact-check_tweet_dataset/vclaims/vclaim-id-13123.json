Today, 350 people in New Zealand have converted to Islam.\n\nThe page further claims, Worldwide, non-Muslims criticise and hate Islam, falling victim to racism and sectarianism. But the citizens of New Zealand have accepted and represented the truthfulness of Islam as a religion. They have displayed that humanity comes first, and have demonstrated that there can be peace in New Zealand by accepting Islam as their religion. Nearly 350 New Zealanders assembled together and in the presence of a Muslim cleric, they willfully converted to Islam.\n\nThe 1-minute-30-second-long video shows a crowd present in a hall. One by one, they go through the process of converting to Islam.\n\nThe same video was also posted by Facebook pages Aalor Pothik\u2019 and Vision of a Sia\u2019.\n\nAFWA did a reverse search of the video and discovered that it is an old video. It was first uploaded on YouTube on September 27, 2009.\n\nWe found the same video on a Russian web portal my.mail.ru uploaded on March 22 in 2011. On top of the video, it is written that some German youngsters are getting converted to Islam.", "lang": "en"}
