The CRS in September issued an updated report so we will mostly rely on that, but it only includes Union deaths in the Civil War; VA also lists Confederate deaths as well as some conflicts not covered by the CRS. When there was a conflict between the numbers, we chose the highest.\n\nThat\u2019s a big raw number. But one might ask whether adding up military deaths across centuries makes much sense. The number of deaths in the Revolutionary War is comparatively small, but it was 1 percent of the U.S. population at the time (about 2.5 million people). The death toll in the Civil War was 100 times as large, but the percentage of the population was 2 percent. So can one really compare the impact on U.S. society between the two conflicts? (Note: the one percent estimate for the Revolutionary War includes deaths from illness or disease, not noted above, which brings the total to about 24,000.)\n\nThe most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report for gun deaths is for 2017 \u2014 39,773 \u2014 and the CDC\u2019s online databases go back to 1981; a rough estimate for the previous 13 years can be developed from a CDC paper on gun deaths from 1968-1991. We don\u2019t have data yet for 2018, but the average for 2015, 2016, and 2017 is 38,225, which is probably close enough.\n\nThere were 23,875 firearms deaths in 1968, according to the CDC. From 1968 to 1980, we can estimate a total of nearly 390,000 from this CDC chart. A CDC database for 1981-1998 records 620,525 deaths, and the 1999-2017 database records 612,310 deaths from firearms. Adding in our estimate for 2018, that gives us roughly 1.66 million deaths from guns in Booker\u2019s lifetime.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the distinction between murders and homicides, for instance. In 2017, the CDC estimated 14,542 homicides out of 39,773 gun deaths. By contrast, the FBI counted 11,006 murders via firearms that year. The same trend continues in other years, with the CDC homicide numbers roughly one-third higher than the murders counted by the FBI.\n\nIf you only counted murders by guns, the number of deaths by guns would be significantly smaller. (Of course, we also were not just counting battlefield deaths, but all deaths in military service during periods of conflict, so the opposite number would also be smaller if one tried to construct an apples-to-apples comparison.)\n\nDaniel Webster, a co-author of the paper and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said an updated paper will soon be submitted for publication showing that \u201cwith additional years of data using the same methodology we estimate a 33 percent decline\u201d in suicides. (The research also found an increase in firearm suicides in Missouri after repeal of a permit law.)\n\n\u201cMany of the risk factors are very similar to that of homicides or other forms of interpersonal violence \u2014 impulsivity, difficulty controlling anger and other emotions, alcohol abuse, unemployment, being a male, and having ready access to a firearm,\u201d Webster said. \u201cLaws that meaningfully reduce the ready availability of firearms, especially under those risk factors, can reduce both suicides and homicides.\u201d\n\nThe Rand Corp., following up on a 2005 National Research Council report that said the relationship was unclear, in 2018 conducted an extensive review of more recent literature and said there is increasing evidence that \u201cgun availability increases the risk of suicide.\u201d Nevertheless, it still reached the same conclusion as the NRC: \u201cAvailable empirical research does not provide strong causal evidence for the effects of gun prevalence on suicide risk.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s numbers add up, especially if one decides that \u201cgun violence\u201d includes all deaths by guns, as measured by the CDC, including suicides and justifiable homicides. But while the numbers are technically correct, we\u2019re not sure if it makes sense to tally up deaths across centuries and then compare them to deaths from the last half-century.", "lang": "en"}
