(En Francia hoy en un barrio musulm\u00e1n a polic\u00edas\u2026esto no sale en la Sexta\u2026..cuando las barbas de tu vecino veas.)\n\nAgence France-Presse had earlier debunked this video and found that it is related to a protest, which took place last month, in Algeria. We found another video of the same incident that had occurred in March, 2019 at Algiers, the capital of Algeria. Cashbah Tribune, a Facebook page, had posted this video on March 8, saying, \u201cAn aspect of the violence against the police this Friday March 8, 2019, Karim Belkacem Street # Algeria (Google translated)\u201d.\n\nMarch, 2019 saw a general strike by Algerians against the fifth term of the ailing president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika. These protests were broadly carried out peacefully across the country until the beginning of April when the demonstrations turned violent. Bouteflika finally resigned earlier this month. until the president finally resigned at the beginning of April, 2019.\n\nEarlier, the video was viral on Twitter with a false narrative that police was attacked by a Muslim mob in Copenhagen, Denmark. However, clashes did occur on April 15 in Copenhagen, which was later followed by the arrest of 23 people.\n\nIn conclusion, a video of protesters attacking a police bus in Algeria was falsely shared as that of a \u2018Muslim mob\u2019 attacking the police in France.", "lang": "en"}
