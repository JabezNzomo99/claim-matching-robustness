Tom Cotton (R-Ark.): \u201cHugh, I believe the Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning. We learned last week that a woman named Monica McLean was Ms. Ford\u2019s roommate, and she was one of the so-called beach friends who encouraged Ms. Ford to go to Dianne Feinstein and the partisan Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. Well, it just turns out, it just so happens that Monica McLean worked for a Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, now a virulent anti-Trump critic on television and former counsel to Chuck Schumer. So I strongly suspect that Chuck Schumer\u2019s political operation knew about Ms. Ford\u2019s allegations as far back as July and manipulated the process all along to include taking advantage of Ms. Ford\u2019s confidences.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what evidence Cotton is relying on to get from Point A (all these people know each other!) to Point B (all these people were secretly in cahoots!). Regardless, the former roommate in question, Monica McLean, never worked for Bharara. So this theory falls apart pretty quickly, relying as it does on a false premise sprinkled with suppositions on top.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Oct. 5 that McLean had pressured Leland Keyser to revise her initial statement about Ford\u2019s allegation. Ford had named Keyser as one of the attendees of the 1982 gathering in which she said Kavanaugh assaulted her, although she said Keyser was not in the room but downstairs. Keyser at first said she did not know about an alleged sexual assault involving Kavanaugh; then, after pressure from McLean, she revised her statement to say she believed but could not confirm Ford\u2019s account.\n\nHer attorney, David H. Laufman, wrote in an email: \u201cAs a supervisory special agent assigned to the press office of the FBI\u2019s New York Division in 2008-2009, Monica McLean was responsible for coordinating news releases with the press office of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York (USAO-SDNY). But Ms. McLean has never been employed by USAO-SDNY or by Preet Bharara. Moreover, Ms. McLean has never met or personally communicated with Mr. Bharara.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
