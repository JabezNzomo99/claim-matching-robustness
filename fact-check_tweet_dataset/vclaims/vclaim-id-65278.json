Part 1 crimes include violent crimes such as homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, as well as property crimes such as burglary, larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.\n\nIn his ad, Sununu lays the blame at Gatsas\u2019 feet. It\u2019s important to note that Gatsas took the mayor\u2019s office in 2010, after the crime trend cited by Sununu started.\n\nTo see the bigger picture, we analyzed the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Statistics for Manchester in five year increments from 2000 to 2015.\n\nThe data shows an overall 17 percent increase in crime rates in Manchester, however, the biggest spike occurred from 2005 to 2010, before Gatsas took office.\n\nAfter Gatsas became mayor, crime went up about 9 percent, far less than Sununu\u2019s statistic.\n\nLooking at year-over-year statistics while Gatsas has been mayor shows crime rising and falling in alternate years, rather than increasing steadily throughout.\n\nCrime rose the most dramatically in 2010 and 2012, when it shot up by 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Years 2011 saw a decrease of 8 percent while 2013 saw a decrease of 6 percent.\n\nManchester police Chief Nick Willard also challenged Sununu\u2019s claim and said crime has actually been going down in Manchester this year.\n\nStatistics released by the department show a 22 percent drop in property crimes between 2015 and 2016, which has driven the overall crime rate down 27 percent so far this year (the rates of violent crime have stayed on par with last year). Of course, the year isn\u2019t over, so that number is subject to change.\n\nManchester police attribute this drop to a new computer model they\u2019ve implemented that allows them to predict where a crime is likely to occur. Using a crime-mapping program, the computer model analyzes where crimes have occurred in the past to predict where they might occur again.\n\nWillard said that program combined with more community policing and beefed up patrols has so far helped drop the city\u2019s crime rate to drop this year.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that economic factors and demographics have a greater influence over crime rates than a city\u2019s elected leader. A chief executive can have some influence over crime rates through police funding, and Gatsas has been a law enforcement backer.\n\nChris Sununu says crime is \u2018rising\u2019 in Manchester and has gone up 19 percent under Mayor Ted Gatsas.\n\nSununu didn\u2019t specify a time range for his claim about crime in the state\u2019s largest city. But looking at recent crime stats from the Manchester Police Department shows crime did increase by 19 percent from 2008 to 2015.\n\nHowever, Gatsas wasn\u2019t in office that whole time and more recent data shows crime in the Queen City to be dropping or holding steady. It\u2019s also dubious to link a crime rate, for good or ill, to any specific administration.\n\nOn balance, we rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
