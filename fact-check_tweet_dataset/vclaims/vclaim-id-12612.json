You\u2019re a general with war on your mind. You\u2019re a dictator who we hate and who\u2019s against us. And that dictator and his wife have a baby on American soil. Congratulations. Your son or daughter is now an American citizen. Does anybody think this makes sense? Does anybody think it makes sense? Congratulations, general, you have a United States citizen as your daughter. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s crazy. But we\u2019re getting it all worked out.\u201d\n\nTrump could have picked literally any other imaginary threat during these riffs on birthright citizenship. But he somehow landed on enemy generals and foreign rulers, whose children are some of the rare exceptions to birthright citizenship under a 120-year-old decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump announced in an interview with Axios that he wants to end by executive order the constitutional right to birthright citizenship. The Supreme Court ultimately could find a way to rule in favor of Trump, but there is wide agreement among legal scholars that Trump\u2019s plan is unconstitutional: The president can\u2019t do this by himself and would need an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn its 1898 decision in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court listed the exceptions of \u201cchildren of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes.\"\n\nThat\u2019s it. No more exceptions. Even if a dictator or a hostile foreign general during wartime or a spouse managed to have a child in the United States (which is improbable at best), there\u2019s a Supreme Court ruling that covers this situation and appears to contradict the president. (What are the odds?)\n\nLet\u2019s say an enemy general or a spouse gave birth while vacationing at Disney World. The proud parent would have to be invading or occupying the state of Florida for the child to be exempt from U.S. citizenship under Wong Kim Ark. \u201cThere\u2019s no provision that says because your parents hate the United States, you\u2019re not covered,\u201d Legomsky said.\n\nThe \u201cchildren of foreign sovereigns or their ministers\u201d are not eligible for birthright citizenship under Wong Kim Ark, so all the monarchs are out. As for a dictator, the dictionary defines \u201csovereign\u201d as \u201cone possessing or held to possess supreme political power or sovereignty,\u201d as \u201cone that exercises supreme authority within a limited sphere,\u201d as \u201can acknowledged leader\u201d or \u201carbiter.\u201d Kim Jong Un, for example, seems to check all the boxes, and like a monarch, his title was passed on from his father and grandfather.\n\nThis does happen, though the birth tourism industry caters mostly to wealthy Russian and Asian women. Estimates vary as to how many thousands of cases there are per year, so it\u2019s hard to get a good read on this issue. One place to start might be Trump\u2019s properties in Florida, a hot spot for Russian birth tourism. The Trump Organization does not benefit directly, according to the Daily Beast, because the expectant Russians are subleasing privately owned condos marketed to them for long stays. However, the nearby Trump International Beach Resort gets some of their business if they wander over there.\n\nHostile dictators and enemy generals are not really the target market for the birth tourism industry, but it won\u2019t stop us from rating Trump\u2019s claims. We\u2019re giving Three Pinocchios. The president mentioned enemy generals \u2014 but not specifically an occupation of U.S. territory, which is the key ingredient for an exception to birthright citizenship. The stuff about dictators is much shakier. The Supreme Court said 120 years ago that the children of \u201cforeign sovereigns or their ministers\u201d were not eligible for birthright citizenship. Dictators seem pretty sovereign to us.", "lang": "en"}
