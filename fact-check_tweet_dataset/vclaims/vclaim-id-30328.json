However, the claim is false and the photo has been shared in a misleading context. The photo actually shows a US missile test off the coast of California in June 2018; the UK government has called for a de-escalation of tensions, which erupted after a US strike killed a top Iranian commander on January 3, 2020.\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook here on January 6, 2020.\n\nThe Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"BREAKING NEWS - Submarine of Britain, to fire missiles at Iran in case war breaks out; Britain promised they support any moves by America; a British submarine is already positioned in a place where their missiles could reach the mainland of Iran; they only await the go signal of America\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nA US drone strike in Baghdad killed top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani on January 3, 2020, in the most dramatic episode of escalating tensions between the two countries yet, AFP reported here.\n\nYet the photo in the misleading Facebook post is being used out of context; it actually shows a US missile test off the coast of Southern California on June 27, 2018.\n\nA reverse image on Google found the photo published on this US Navy page. According to the website, the launch demonstrates the Navy\u2019s \u201cability to conduct forceful military operations in the Pacific.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the US Navy photo:\n\nThe US Navy photo is captioned: \u201cPACIFIC OCEAN (June 27, 2018) The crew of the Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine USS Annapolis (SSN 760) launch a Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) off the coast of Southern California as part of a Tomahawk Flight Test (TFT). This launch was a demonstration of strike capabilities from the sea and showed the Navy's ability to conduct forceful military operations in the Pacific.

Following his death, we urge all parties to de-escalate.
