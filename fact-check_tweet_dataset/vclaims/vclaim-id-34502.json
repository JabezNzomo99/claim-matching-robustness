The message in it is in Hindi and its English translation is- \u2018When a Bihar man raped (a girl), all the Biharis were made to go out of Gujarat, but thousands of Bangladeshi and Rohingya terrorists, rapists, murderers who engaged themselves in smuggling, rioting, looting and other crimes were made the sons-in-law here (West Bengal).
