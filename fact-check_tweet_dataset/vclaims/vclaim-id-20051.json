It is estimated that the population of Africa will grow close to that figure by 2050.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Africa Check decided to judge each claim separately.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what Radebe said. When he spoke in parliament he made no mention of comparing Africa\u2019s 2050 population with India and China\u2019s 2015 population.\n\nThe United Nations report provides population projections for 2015, 2030, 2050 and 2100.\n\nIn 2015, Africa\u2019s population was estimated at\n\nFast forward 35 years and Africa\u2019s population is expected to double. By 2050, the continent is predicted to be home to\n\nThat same year just over\n\npeople are expected to call India home, compared to\n\nin China. Their combined population will come in at 3.1 billion.\n\nThe claim that the continent \u201cwill have the same population\u201d as India and China combined is therefore incorrect.\n\nNow we can move onto fact-checking what the minister was meant to say.\n\nAn online copy of Radebe\u2019s speech shows that he should have added the word \u201ctoday\u201d at the end of the sentence. It\u2019s a small but important difference.\n\nBy 2050, Africa\u2019s population of 2.5 billion is still expected to be lower than India and China\u2019s combined 2015 population estimate of 2.7 billion.\n\nThis is a difference of around 210 million people. Or, put another way, a shortfall of about 1 Nigeria, 3 South Africas or 26 Lesothos when current population sizes are considered.\n\nThe minister\u2019s online speech is closer to the truth, although still an exaggeration.", "lang": "en"}
