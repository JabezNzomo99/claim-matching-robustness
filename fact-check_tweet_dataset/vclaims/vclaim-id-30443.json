Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said William Wilberforce, a late 18th century British politician, \u201cpushed the sale of beer\u201d to successfully combat \u201cdrunkenness related to gin\u201d in England. But Wilberforce wasn\u2019t even born until after the so-called gin epidemic had ended in the early 1750s, and its conclusion wasn\u2019t due to beer.\n\nThe gin epidemic\u2019s end eventually came at the hand of multiple factors, including the rising price of grain, reduced wages and legislation that raised taxes on gin. Beer consumption also remained stagnant during the 18th century, which experts say suggests people were drinking gin, or cheap spirits generally, in addition to beer, not substituting one for the other.\n\nCassidy, also a doctor, made his claims on April 5 during the confirmation hearing of Scott Gottlieb, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nCassidy then compared what he believed to be the solution to gin drinking in England to tobacco use today. He said \u201cmaybe the way to address tobacco is by tobacco mitigation,\u201d namely by \u201clooking for products that would be an alternative to a cigarette\u201d with \u201cless of the untoward effects.\u201d Later on during the hearing, Cassidy doubled-down on his claims about gin and beer during an exchange with Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota.\n\nFranken has good reason to be skeptical. There was a William at the time who depicted beer drinking as being preferrable to gin drinking during the gin epidemic \u2014 Cassidy may have been referring to that. But, if so, Cassidy had the wrong William, and, regardless, beer consumption didn\u2019t end the gin epidemic.\n\nWe reached out to Cassidy\u2019s office for support multiple times, but we haven\u2019t received a response. If we do, we\u2019ll update this piece accordingly.\n\nThe Rise of the \u2018Gin Epidemic\u2019\n\nWhat caused the epidemic to begin with? According to historians, a proliferation in the domestic production of spirits played a large role.\n\nIn the 16th century, gin and other spirits were rarely consumed in England. Most distilling occurred only for medicinal purposes, according to Peter Clark, a historian at the University of Helsinki in Finland. But by the 1680s, the consumption of spirits had spread across the southern portion of the country, though most supplies came from abroad, primarily France, explains Clark in a paper published in Transactions of the Royal Historical Society in April 1987.\n\nIn the late 1680s, when England went to war with France, the English Parliament passed a series of laws that protected domestic distilleries from foreign imports. For example, England imposed duties on imported spirits and abolished the monopoly that the London Company of Distillers had on the domestic production of spirits. This led to a proliferation of distillers in the country. By the 1730s, London alone was said to have 1,500 distilleries, says Clark.\n\nWith more distilleries, gin and other spirits became affordable and accessible to \u201cworking-class consumers,\u201d explains historian Jessica Warner and co-authors in a paper published in the American Journal of Public Health in March 2001. In an email, Warner, who wrote a book on the gin epidemic, also explained that \u201c\u2018gin\u2019 was an umbrella term for cheap, domestically produced spirits\u201d; hence the historical label, \u201cgin epidemic\u201d or \u201cgin craze.\u201d\n\nAccording to Warner and colleagues, \u201cOnce established, the domestic distillery very quickly emerged as an important source of revenue to the Crown.\u201d This led to increasing taxation on gin and other spirits between 1710 and 1762. At the same time, \u201cOnly gradually did the state concern itself with the threat, probably more imagined than real, that gin posed to maintaining public order,\u201d particularly in London, which was England\u2019s largest market for distilled spirits, the group adds. With this concern, regulating gin also became a way of combating what was seen as an epidemic.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s unclear how much of a problem the so-called epidemic posed, but Warner and her colleagues write, \u201cattempts to restrict the consumption of distilled spirits were rooted in an essentially hierarchical vision of the social order.\u201d These attempts \u201creflected the belief that the excesses of the working poor posed a particular threat to the nation, threatening to deprive it of both workers and soldiers.\u201d\n\nThe Fall of the \u2018Gin Epidemic\u2019\n\nWarner and colleagues date the so-called epidemic as peaking between roughly 1720 and 1751. During this time, the British Parliament passed a number of \u201cGin Acts\u201d that raised taxes on distilled spirits, while also aiming to \u201climit the number\u201d of outlets \u201clicensed to sell them,\u201d the group writes.\n\nFrom 1700 to 1729, the consumption of British spirits grew by 260 percent, from 0.36 gallons per person (15 years or older) per year to 1.31 gallons. A peak in consumption in 1729 paralleled the first of the gin acts, which Warner and colleagues argue led to a 24 percent drop in consumption the following year.\n\nHowever, consumption grew again, reaching a peak of 1.74 gallons in 1735. The Parliament then passed another act in 1736, which led to a 30 percent drop in consumption over the next year. Yet by 1743, consumption had again grown, reaching a peak of 2.21 gallons per person per year.\n\nConsumption then dropped from 1.83 gallons in 1744 to 0.59 gallons in 1771. Another gin act was also passed in 1751, which Warner and colleagues argue finally \u201csucceeded\u201d in controlling the gin epidemic, but \u201cby accident rather than by design,\u201d as we\u2019ll explain.\n\nAt the height of consumption, the 2.21 gallons per person per year would be less than an ounce of gin (or other spirits) per person per day. It would be the equivalent of drinking about one gin and tonic (with 1.5 ounces of gin) every other day.\n\nFor comparison, U.S. consumption between 2008 and 2010 was about 2 gallons of spirits (80 proof) per person (15 years or older) per year on average, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 also under an ounce per day. However, Warner told us that spirits were likely often diluted during the epidemic, so comparisons to today might not be valid.\n\nOverall, Warner and her colleagues argue legislation had mainly short-term effects on combating the so-called epidemic, that is, only in the first year after the passage of each act.\n\nBut what finally did in the epidemic?\n\nAround the time of the passage of the 1751 act, \u201cthe government started to gain the upper hand,\u201d write Warner and colleagues. Based on their analysis, \u201cthe effects of increased taxation may have been magnified by a gradual decline in real wages,\u201d they write. Hence, this gin act may have \u201csucceeded\u201d because of other changes occurring in the country at the time.\n\nWarner elaborated on this point in an email. She said, \u201c[T]he English population is pretty much stagnant in the first half of the eighteenth century, meaning that it had the disposable income to spend on more alcohol.\u201d But in the second half of the century, the population grew rapidly, which means \u201cthat working people had less money to spend on luxuries such as alcohol.\u201d\n\nIn other words, rapid population growth can drive down real wages. The idea is that if more people are available for work, then employers can pay each person they do hire less, she explained.\n\nBut there was another stressor at play \u2014 the rising cost of grain.\n\nThe price of grain went up for two reasons, Warner told us. First, \u201cdemand rose with the population,\u201d and second, \u201cthe generally good harvests of the first half of the century were followed by the generally poor harvests of the second half,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, gin is made from grain, so that\u2019s one factor in pricing it out of the reach of more people,\u201d but \u201cwith food being the principal expenditure for most families, any increase in the price of bread had to be met by belt-tightening elsewhere,\u201d she added.\n\nIn a nutshell, \u201cLower wages + higher food costs = less money to spend on alcohol,\u201d Warner said.\n\nWarner and colleagues also say that the government\u2019s \u201cinterventions to limit consumption did not succeed\u201d until there was \u201csome level of public consensus\u201d on gin\u2019s negative effects. They point out that a lack of public consensus might help account for the failure of early legislation to regulate gin.\n\nSo, did beer, as Cassidy said, play any part in ending the gin epidemic?\n\nThe trends in consumption don\u2019t suggest it. While the consumption of spirits increased, beer drinking during the 18th century generally remained static, say Warner and colleagues, at roughly 30 gallons per person per year. That\u2019s about 10.5 ounces of beer a day.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no evidence to support Cassidy\u2019s claim that promoting beer to combat gin drinking led to \u201ca milestone in the cessation of alcoholism.\u201d And that certainly wasn\u2019t done by William Wilberforce, who was born in 1759, after the gin epidemic had ended.\n\nHowever, James Nicholls, a historian at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, did say by email that Cassidy may be confusing William Wilberforce with William Hogarth.\n\n\u201cThe Senator may be thinking about the regulation of the gin trade around 1751, which was in part motivated by William Hogarth\u2019s famous prints Gin Lane and Beer Street, which certainly did suggest beer was the healthy alternative to gin,\u201d Nicholls said.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Hogarth\u2019s prints were part of a campaign to curb gin drinking around this time, a campaign which resulted in the 1751 gin act. \u201cHowever, the 1751 Gin Act really only amplified a reduction in gin drinking that had started in the mid-1740s \u2013 though it was seen at the time as effectively bringing an end to the \u2018Gin Craze,'\u201d added Nicholls.\n\nWilberforce, on the other hand, \u201cwas a founding member of the \u2018Proclamation Society\u2018 in 1787, which campaigned against vice generally, and did call for better regulation of public houses,\u201d or pubs, added Nicholls. \u201cBut by then gin was not the political issue it had been 50 years earlier.\u201d\n\nTo top it off, Dan Malleck, a historian at Brock University in Canada, told us by email that another premise of Cassidy\u2019s claim is off. Cassidy said Wilberforce pushed the sale of beer over gin because \u201cthe idea is that you\u2019d get so bloated\u201d when drinking beer, compared with drinking gin, thereby tempering alcohol consumption. But \u201cbeer wasn\u2019t heavily carbonated in the 18th century,\u201d Malleck said, which means that it likely wouldn\u2019t cause as much bloating as beer does today.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "lang": "en"}
