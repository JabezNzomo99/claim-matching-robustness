What is striking is how he talks about job creation \u2014 that any job growth is essentially his doing. In our recollection, this is different than other, recent presidents.\n\nNote the difference. The economy has added jobs, America has added jobs, \u201cwe have worked together\u201d and so forth. Obama, in particular, also liked to say that \u201cour businesses\u201d have added jobs, so that way he could cite the better private-employment numbers; the drop in state and local government employment during much of his presidency kept dragging down overall employment numbers.\n\nAll presidents try to pat themselves on the back if the economy is doing well. But Trump drops any pretense and simply says that he, himself, created more than 1 million jobs in six months.\n\nBut economists say that presidents don\u2019t really deserve credit for job creation, especially at this stage of a presidency. \u201cTrump overuses the pronoun \u2018I,\u2019 always, but presidents always claim more credit than they deserve when things go well,\u201d said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton University professor and former vice chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nBlinder in 2015 co-wrote a paper that explored why the U.S. economy since World War II appears to do better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones. (\u201cOver a typical four-year presidency the U.S. economy grew by 18.5% when the president was a Democrat, but only by 10.6% when he was a Republican.\u201d) An empirical analysis found much of the difference could be explained by a blend of good policy and good luck, but the authors could \u201cnot attribute any of the partisan growth gap to fiscal or monetary policy.\u201d Instead, oil shocks and productivity growth \u2014 both of which are tenuously connected to a president\u2019s policies \u2014 played a more substantial role in the difference.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is obviously incorrect if we interpret his statement literally, because, as you say, it is the nation\u2019s (mostly private) employers who are responsible for the employment growth,\u201d Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution wrote in an email. \u201cThe federal government has reduced employment (by 7,000 workers) on a seasonally adjusted basis or increased employment (with no seasonal adjustment) by just 21,000 since January, so federal payroll changes have not contributed materially to the change in U.S. payroll employment.\u201d\n\nIn the first six months of Trump\u2019s presidency, there have been slightly more than 1 million jobs created, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But Burtless noted there\u2019s been very little change in the trend in employment in the first six months of 2017, compared with the same period in the previous four years. In fact, the gain in payroll employment in the January-through-July period was a bit slower in 2017 compared with the previous four years, whether measured as an absolute rise in the number of nonfarm payroll jobs or as a percentage of employment in January of the indicated year.\n\nTrump might have a better case for bragging if he could point to major new policies that had been rapidly adopted and quickly implemented, as was the case with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, Ronald Reagan in 1981 and Barack Obama in 2009. But Trump has not achieved much on the legislative front. In any case, as we noted, Blinder could not find much impact from fiscal policy. Economists, after all, have disagreed about whether Obama\u2019s fiscal stimulus helped or hurt the economy.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, the Fact Checker automatically assigns Two Pinocchios for claims that a president is responsible for job growth. That kind of statement simply lacks context \u2014 and ignores the fact that it takes time and effort for presidential policies to work their way through a country as large as the United States. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, suggesting he is personally responsible for 1 million jobs being created, almost pushes it to a three. But at its core, this is a statement that lacks a lot of context about how the U.S. economy functions.", "lang": "en"}
