But this claim is false; the footage was actually filmed in northern Syria and shows protesters attacking a joint Turkish-Russian patrol.\n\nThe video was notably shared on this Facebook page, which has more than 80,000 followers. It has been viewed over 13,000 times since it was posted on January 7, 2020.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cVideo of Iraq citizens stonning [sic] U.S Army caravan in Iraq.\u201d\n\nThe same video was posted alongside the same claim in several other Facebook posts, like here and here.\n\nThe logo on the video belongs to the Russian international television network RT (formerly known as Russia Today).\n\nUsing the digital verification tool InVID, we extracted keyframes and ran a reverse image search on the Yandex search engine. This led us to find the same video (in higher quality, and slightly longer) on RT Arabic\u2019s official YouTube page. The title, in Arabic, reads \u201cThe residents of Al-Malikiyah throw stones at Turkish patrols,\u201d and the caption mentions that this is a Turkish-Russian joint patrol. Al-Malikiyah is a city in northern Syria.\n\nLast November, during the same week RT published this video, AFP reported that a Turkish-Russian military patrol was pelted with stones by angry protesters in northern Syria.\n\nBy typing different keywords into YouTube (like \u201cTurkish,\u201d \u201cRussian,\u201d \u201cSyria\u201d and \u201cstones\u201d), we found other videos from the same protest, including a CBS Evening News report titled \u201cKurds protest Turkish and Russian forces in Syria\u201d. The report features CBS foreign correspondent Charlie d\u2019Agata reporting on the ground in northern Syria.\n\nA closer look at CBS report shows that it matches the location of the RT video.\n\nFirst, there is a cemetery along the roadside in both videos. In the first clip, the graves are visible starting at 1'10'', while in the CBS report, they appear at 1'16''.\n\nIn both videos, you can see an identical tree in the cemetery, as shown below.\n\nAt one point, the two videos also share the exact same shot showing a man dressed in beige trousers and a white shirt throwing a projectile at the passing vehicles. The camera then pans out to reveal a boy dressed all in red and a girl in a white shirt and black pants, who are also throwing projectiles.\n\nIn October 2019, Turkey and Russia agreed to patrol a strip of land in northern Syria in a bid to remove the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia to beyond 30 kilometres from the Turkish border. The deal brokered between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin can be found here.\n\nWhy was this deal made?\n\nThe Turkish government considers the YPG to be a terror group due to its links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) that has waged a bloody campaign against the Turkish state since 1984. Ankara and Moscow struck the deal after the United States\u2019 abrupt withdrawal of 1,000 US troops from northern Syria in October 2019.", "lang": "en"}
