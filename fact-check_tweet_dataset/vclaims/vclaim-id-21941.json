You can view the video below and its archived version here.\n\nA close observation of the video shows that Ghosh, in a fit of rage, lifts a microphone and not a gun, as claimed by several social media users.\n\nGhosh lost his temper when Pramanik took a dig at his son and said, \u201cwhat if I ask that his son is involved in trafficking of women? Have I asked (that)?\"\n\nFollowing which, Ghosh threatened to throw the mic at Pramanik.\n\nWhat followed was complete pandemonium with members of the audience disrupting filming of the show.\n\nBOOM got in touch with Zee24 Ghanta's Editor and Channel Head, Anirban Choudhury who said, \u201cIt is obviously understood that it\u2019s not a gun but a microphone. People spreading such messages do so with malicious intentions.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the pandemonium caused, he added, \u201cIt is a normal thing in such district live shows. We handle it our way.\u201d\n\nIn fact, moderator of the show, Nandy, also tweeted mentioning that it was a microphone and not a gun.\n\nBOOM reached out to Rabindranath Ghosh for a comment.
