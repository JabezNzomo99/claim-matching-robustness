Cory Booker of New Jersey to go after animal agriculture.\n\n\"Kamala Harris wants to eliminate this right here. If you raise beef or eat beef, you can't vote (for) the Democratic Party this election. She has worked with Cory Booker on eliminating animal agriculture and is on record starting that meat is killing the planet. That shows her ignorance,\" the post says.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nDespite what this post alleges, Harris hasn\u2019t said she wants to eliminate beef.\n\nIn July, Booker, who is a vegan, introduced legislation to protect workers at meatpacking plants, which became deadly hot spots amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill would suspend waivers and rules that permit companies to ramp up production, and Harris was one of its cosponsors.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in July that 16,233 COVID-19 cases in 239 meat and poultry processing facilities were reported in 23 states across the country.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Facebook users who are weighing in on Harris\u2019 policy recommendations for meat consumption and production.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s YouTube account recently shared a video clip from Harris at a CNN climate change town hall during the Democratic primaries in September 2019. At an August 2020 speech in Iowa, Vice President Mike Pence criticized her town hall remarks and said, \"We\u2019re not going to let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America\u2019s meat.\"\n\nBut Pence\u2019s statements were misleading. Here\u2019s what Harris said at the town hall.\n\n\"As a nation, we actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating,\" Harris said in response to a question at the CNN town hall.\n\nThe agriculture sector contributed 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Cattle produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as part of their digestive process, and the management of manure can also add to emissions.\n\nHarris added that the government should create incentives and change dietary guidelines to reduce the consumption of red meat, as opposed to banning it altogether.\n\n\"I love cheeseburgers from time to time,\" Harris said.\n\nA viral Facebook post says that Kamala Harris wants to eliminate beef.\n\nHarris didn\u2019t say that. She and Cory Booker support legislation that would prevent meatpacking companies from ramping up production, but they didn\u2019t propose eliminating beef. Harris even said that she enjoys a cheeseburger every now and then.", "lang": "en"}
