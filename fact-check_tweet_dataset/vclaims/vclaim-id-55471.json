The musician also shared a screen capture on Instagram of a pro-Trump Facebook page that was sharing this miscaptioned picture:\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time an image has been miscaptioned in an apparent attempt to embarrass or smear O\u2019Rourke. In February 2019, a picture of a man at an LGBT pride parade with the words \u201cvegan,\u201d \u201cfeminist,\u201d and \u201catheist\u201d written on his body was shared as if it were the 2020 presidential hopeful.", "lang": "en"}
