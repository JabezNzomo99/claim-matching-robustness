Kennedy airport? You are a persona non grata in the US, boy, that's why.)\n\nAs of this posting, the Facebook post got at least 118 interactions, 118 comments, and 202 shares.\n\nThe facts: Dela Rosa was not held at a US airport. He was also not declared a persona non grata by the United States.\n\nDela Rosa indeed went to the US and posted the photos on his Facebook account on December 7. It carries the caption, apparently in jest: \"Homeless @ JFK airport, NY. Laag pa more! (Go ahead, travel more!)\"\n\nSucceeding posts on his Facebook account show that he has gone to different places in the US in recent days, like California and Las Vegas.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
