The claim is false and such an order would require a special proclamation from the country\u2019s president.\n\nA Facebook post shared more than 160 times and archived here warns people that the Zambian army is enforcing a 9:00 pm curfew.\n\nAn image that appears to show soldiers being transported on the back of military vehicles is included in the poorly written post.\n\nThose who ignore the curfew risk being taken to \u201cmilitary jail\u201d, according to the claim.\n\nVariations of the claim appear here and here on Facebook. One of them states that the curfew is an attempt to \u201cbring to an end the gassing of innocent people\u201d.\n\nAs reported by AFP, Zambia recently deployed soldiers in an attempt to suppress a wave of attacks on civilians by gangs using a special gas to immobilise their victims.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts in Zambia have spread panic about the attacks. AFP Fact Check looked into how the misinformation started and debunked some of the claims.\n\nA basic internet search using the keywords \u201cdefence minister Zambia curfew\u201d from the misleading post revealed contradictory articles.\n\nAmong them was a media report by Zambia\u2019s National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC), saying Zambian defence minister Davies Chama had refuted claims that the army had implemented a curfew restricting the movement of people after 9:00 pm.\n\nMedia outlet Smart Eagles, which followed the minister as he and his home affairs counterpart Stephen Kampyongo visited townships in Lusaka, also reported in this post that Chama had dismissed claims of a curfew.\n\nChama reportedly said only President Edgar Lungu had the authority to declare a curfew.\n\nIndeed, section 15 of the Preservation of Public Security Act, available here on the country\u2019s parliamentary website, gives Zambia\u2019s leader sole power to impose curfews.\n\nZambia police spokeswoman Esther Katongo denied the existence of a curfew. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not true,\u201d she responded on WhatsApp.\n\nAFP\u2019s Zambia correspondent Obert Simwanza also confirmed the rumours were false, with people out and about after 9:00 pm.", "lang": "en"}
