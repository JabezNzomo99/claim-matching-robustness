The claim has been routinely debunked over the years as a hoax.\n\nThe Facebook post, which features a screen grab of a text message, asks people for prayers and urges them to pass the message along to others. It has been shared more than 300 times.

The country\u2019s constitution, which establishes Islam as the state religion, grants minority religious groups freedom to exercise their faiths \u201cwithin the limits of the law,\u201d but makes proselytizing and apostasy punishable by death, according to the State Department.\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any recent media reports of 22 Christian missionaries being sentenced to death or executed in Afghanistan, only other fact-checkers debunking the claim as a hoax. According to Snopes, the hoax has been circulating since at least 2009, spreading via text message, email and social media.\n\nOne widely-shared version includes an image purportedly showing the execution of a Christian missionary in Afghanistan. However, Agence France-Presse (AFP) determined that the photo likely depicts a member of the Islamic State executing a man accused of spying in Iraq.\n\nWhile the Facebook post\u2019s claim has been routinely debunked as a hoax, there have been cases of the Taliban and other Islamic militant groups killing people accused of being Christian missionaries in Afghanistan.
