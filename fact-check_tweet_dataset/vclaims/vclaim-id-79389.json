It is also being claimed that it holds a world record. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Indian flag being hoisted at Wagah border in Punjab. Fact: The video is not related to flag hoisting at Wagah border. The video was taken at Hyderabad when a 108 X 72 feet large Indian flag was hoisted on a 291 feet tall flag post in 2016. Also, the flag at Attari (near Wagah border) does not hold the world record. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same video was found to be uploaded by a Facebook user in January 2017 with the claim that the video is related to a flag hoisted at Tank Bund in Hyderabad. So, when we searched with the relevant keywords, a video of the same flag hoisting event taken from another angle was found on YouTube. In the description of the video, the following can be read \u2013 \u2018CM KCR Hoists Largest Indian Biggest Flag in Hyderabad\u2019. Similar visuals (same plants, same car, and same music at same timings) can be seen in both the videos. The video was taken at Hyderabad when a 108 X 72 feet large Indian flag was hoisted on a 291 feet tall flag post in 2016. The flag hoisted in the video was then (in 2016) the largest and second tallest flag in India. More videos of the event at Hyderabad on 2 June 2016 (Telangana State Formation Day) can be seen here and here.\n\nIn March 2017, then the largest flag was hoisted on a 360 feet tall flag post (then, tallest in India) at Attari, near Wagah border, in Punjab. So, the Hyderabad flag lost the largest flag tag to Attari. Pakistan first objected to the Attari flag but later hoisted a large flag on a 400 feet pole as a counter to India. Also, later, the largest flag in India was hoisted at Belgavi (Karnataka) in 2018 on a flag post which was 361 feet high. It is taller than the Attari flag post by just one foot. It is to be noted that the list keeps on changing with many States trying to install the tallest and the largest flag. Some news agencies have reported in 2019 that a 380 feet tall flag post will be coming up at Meerut. The tallest and the largest flags in the world can be found here and here respectively.\n\nTo sum it up, an old flag hoisting video from Hyderabad falsely shared as flag hoisting at Wagah border.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
