A near-identical report previously made the rounds in Nigeria. As with the Nigerian version, Canadian authorities have dismissed the reports about Kenya, calling them \u201cfake news\u201d. Canada is indeed seeking to take in a million more immigrants before 2021, but not from any one particular country.\n\nThe claim was published on a website identified as CBTV, which we\u2019ve archived here. It contained alleged quotes from Trudeau and a spokesperson for the Canadian Labour Department.\n\nCBTV used the exact same quotes in its false article about Canada seeking a million Nigerian immigrants -- simply changing the name of the country and \u201cWest Africa\u201d to \u201cEast Africa\u201d. Every other detail of the story is identical. We debunked the Nigerian story here.\n\nIn Kenya, similar claims were shared here and here, based on the CBTV version. The three posts have generated more than 12,000 interactions on Facebook between them, according to data from social media analysis tool CrowdTangle.\n\nHowever, as with the Nigerian story, the Canadian High Commission in Kenya dismissed the claim as bogus in a May 2 tweet.\n\nAccording to the government's 2018 Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration, Canada plans to welcome about one million immigrants between 2019 and 2021.\n\nThe report does not single out any country where these immigrants are meant to come from.\n\n\u201cCanada will welcome more talented workers with the skills and expertise our economy needs, reunite more family members and accommodate more refugees looking to start new lives,\u201d the report reads.\n\nIn Canada\u2019s 2016 census, 27,150 people identified themselves as Kenyan immigrants.", "lang": "en"}
