Using a nurse who had breast cancer as the speaker, Baldwin makes a two-part claim:\n\nVukmir took the unusual step of rebutting the ad by posting a letter to the nurse on Twitter.\n\nAll of this is tied to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and its prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 something that is threatened by Republican efforts, which are supported by Vukmir, to repeal the law.\n\nSo, let\u2019s check both parts of Baldwin\u2019s claim.\n\nThe higher the number it is that Baldwin chooses is significant, because it would mean that many more people are potentially vulnerable if the second part of her claim is true.\n\nOne of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act is its requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions. That is, if you don\u2019t have health insurance from an employer or the government, you have guaranteed access to insurance in the individual market, regardless of your health, and you can\u2019t be charged higher rates for a pre-existing condition.\n\nBefore Obamacare, insurers typically used medical underwriting \u2014 evaluating the health status, health history and other risk factors of an applicant \u2014 to determine whether to deny a person coverage. Even for people they did accept, insurers could carve out coverage of any specific pre-existing conditions, as well as charge people with health problems higher premiums.\n\nTo back Baldwin\u2019s 2.4 million people figure, her campaign pointed us to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut this is a broad count. It includes not only people who could be denied insurance coverage \u2014 which is what Baldwin highlights in the TV ad \u2014 but also people who could buy coverage but be charged more because of a pre-existing condition.\n\nIn contrast, the latest estimate by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the gold-standard sources on health care, is based on the number of people in Wisconsin who had health conditions that likely would have left them uninsurable before the Affordable Care Act. That estimate is much smaller: 852,000.\n\nSo, there is a basis for Baldwin\u2019s 2.4 million figure. But it\u2019s misleadingly high in the context of the second part of her statement.\n\nIt is worth noting, that if the Affordable Care Act were repealed, it\u2019s possible premiums for some people with pre-existing conditions could be so high as to make insurance virtually unaffordable.\n\nVukmir has not specifically said that insurers should be able to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and she has said people with pre-existing conditions should be covered. But she has been vague on how that would happen. She has proposed \"allowing insurers to offer a wider variety of plans\" and enabling people to buy insurance across state lines.\n\nWhen Baldwin\u2019s ad says Vukmir supports letting insurance companies \"deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions,\" a footnote on the screen refers to three news stories, but only one that mentions Vukmir.\n\nThat story, by the Wisconsin State Journal, reported how Vukmir wants to fully repeal Obamacare \u2014 which would mean also eliminating its guarantee against insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe story also notes that Vukmir has supported GOP repeal bills in Congress that would weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions. For example, she praised the GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act. It would have kept the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions must be offered health insurance -- but it would have dropped Obamacare\u2019s rules capping how much extra those people could be charged.\n\nAnd the story reports that Vukmir supports returning to what Wisconsin offered before Obamacare \u2014 a publicly-subsidized high-risk pool for people with pre-existing conditions who couldn\u2019t get insurance.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s high-risk pool was held up as something as a model, at least for the people it covered. But it worked only for people who could afford the insurance in the first place \u2014 and many people with pre-existing conditions could not afford coverage from the high-risk pool, as it covered fewer than 25,000 people.\n\nIn responding to Baldwin\u2019s TV ad, Vukmir\u2019s campaign pointed to a news release it issued in which Vukmir alludes to the high-risk pools, saying Wisconsin \"had solutions for those with pre-existing conditions before it was cool to take care of people with pre-existing conditions.\" But the release didn\u2019t offer more specifics on how they would be covered.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s high-risk pool existed specifically because insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nMoreover, the pool, unlike Obamacare, did not provide coverage for everyone who couldn\u2019t get coverage because of a pre-existing condition.\n\nBaldwin said \"2.4 million people in Wisconsin have pre-existing conditions\" and Vukmir supports letting insurance companies \"deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nThere is some basis for the first part of Baldwin\u2019s statement. One estimate puts the number of at 2.4 million \u2014 but those that could be denied health insurance coverage because of a condition is estimated to be much smaller, 852,000.\n\nOn the second part of Baldwin\u2019s statement, Vukmir has indicated that high-risk pools are a solution for covering people with pre-existing conditions. But those were in place because -- before the Affordable Care Act, which Vukmir wants to repeal -- insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. And Wisconsin\u2019s high-risk pool covered only a fraction of people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThat being said, Vukmir has not specifically said she supports allowing insurers to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and she has said those should be covered \u2014 even if she has been vague about how that would happen.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, we give Baldwin a Half True.", "lang": "en"}
