There may well be extraordinary people who get a lower ATAR who would make a great teacher but as a rule, we need to be lifting the standard, lifting the cut-off, not lowering it.\"\n\nShe called on universities to \"stop the slide\" by setting minimum entry scores for teaching at 80 ATAR points, a move supported by the federal education union but opposed by the peak body for university deans of education.\n\nTougher entry requirements have been introduced in Victoria, where the State Government has set a floor of 70 ATAR points for school leavers, and NSW, where students must score at least 80 points in three ATAR subjects.\n\nNow, you might think the entry scores advertised by universities would show whether marks were falling. But that's not the case.\n\nMelbourne University Emeritus Professor Stephen Dinham told Fact Check the advertised cut-offs generally referred to guaranteed entry scores, and that universities \"take people a lot lower than that\".\n\nSo when it comes to measuring entry standards, he said, the advertised scores can be misleading.\n\nIndeed, a ministerial advisory group found in 2014 that these were \"a weak guide to actual entry standards\" for teaching courses, with some universities enrolling many students who did not meet them.\n\nAnother problem with measuring the academic hurdle is that students are not necessarily admitted on their ATAR alone.\n\nAccording to AITSL, \"having an ATAR available does not indicate this was the mechanism by which the student was selected for a program\".\n\nUniversities can use various methods to select entrants, including interviews and psychometric assessments, and may award bonus ATARs to disadvantaged students.\n\nAs Ms Plibersek noted in January, they can also make allowances \"for people who for some reason or another have a particularly bad year in high school\".\n\nThe rules vary between course providers and, as the Government's Higher Education Standards Panel found, they can be opaque.\n\nAccording to a 2015 report by AITSL: \"As the selection processes are tailored towards selecting students for specific programs and in specific contexts, no aggregated data on the selection processes exist.\"\n\nProfessor Wyatt-Smith said it wasn't possible to say whether overall entry standards were falling because \"we haven't got a composite of all the indicators that are considered, at the national level\".\n\nSo, what data is there?\n\nExperts told Fact Check the best source for statistics on teacher training courses was AITSL, which publishes yearly admissions data gathered by the Commonwealth Department of Education.\n\nIts latest ATAR figures, for 2016, only cover school leavers who enrolled in undergraduate degrees.\n\nThe report shows that of the almost 30,000 students admitted to teaching degrees in 2016, roughly 13,000 new undergraduate students came from elsewhere \u2014 admitted on the basis of mature entry or higher education, for example \u2014 while more than 9,000 were studying postgraduate degrees.\n\nOf the nearly 7,300 domestic school leavers, nearly 2,300 did not have an ATAR recorded.\n\nAll told, data on entry scores was available for around 5,000 students, or just 17 per cent of new teaching students in 2016.\n\nA submission from the education department to a recent parliamentary inquiry suggested similar figures for 2017, with 82 per cent of all new teaching students \"admitted on a basis other than ATAR\".\n\nProfessor Dinham told Fact Check the institute's data was \"probably\" the best proxy currently on offer.\n\nBut Professor Wyatt Smith, citing the few students affected by ATARs and the array of other variables to consider, said student scores were \"not a proxy for minimum entry thresholds\".\n\nThe 2018 AITSL report includes a time series showing the proportion of new undergraduate teaching students with scores in six ATAR ranges.\n\nIt shows that between 2007 and 2016, there was a fall in the share of higher-scoring students \u2014 those with ATARs of 71 to 80 and 81 to 90 \u2014 and an increase in the share of students with scores in the lower ranges of 30 to 50 and 51 to 60.\n\nMeanwhile, there was a slight increase in the share of students with ATARs of 91 to 100.\n\nTo put that in context, the average ATAR for NSW students is usually around 70, and the Grattan Institute has reported that \"about the same proportion of students receive each ATAR in each state\".\n\nIn other words, there are increasing numbers of students with \"below average\" ATARs getting into teaching.\n\nMs Plibersek's tweet said marks were getting lower and lower.\n\nThough she did not specify a time period, both the ten and five-year trends do show that, while the share of students with scores of 61 to 70 and 91 to 100 remained more or less stable, there were fewer students enrolling with ATARs of 71 to 90 and more enrolling with ATARs of 30 to 60.\n\nThere was a slight increase in high-achieving students in the final year of data, with the proportion of students in the three highest bands \u2014 with scores from 71 to 100 \u2014 all rising in 2016.\n\nHowever, the trends do not prove scores \"to get into teaching\" are getting lower.\n\nEnrolling more students with ATAR scores of 35, for example, might lower the average student entry score, but that is not the same as lowering a minimum entry requirement from 35 to 30.\n\nIn summary, while the numbers do not prove universities have been progressively lowering entry thresholds, they do show that lower-scoring students are becoming more common.\n\nJulie Sonnemann, School Education Fellow with the Grattan Institute, said that while the ATAR data only applied to a slice of undergraduate students, it did not necessarily mean undergraduate students entering through other pathways had performed any better at high school.\n\nDr Rachel Wilson, senior lecturer in educational assessment with the University of Sydney, said there was a \"concerning\" number of school leavers being enrolled without an ATAR.\n\nIndeed, the latest AITSL report shows they accounted for roughly a third of new undergraduate teaching students in 2016 \u2014 or 2,262 of 7,482 students. (That share fell in recent years but rose over the decade).\n\nDr Wilson explained that all school leavers will receive a score when they finish school, but universities do not have to report them if the student is enrolled on another basis.\n\nAccording to a 2018 ABC News report, a leaked 2018 report co-authored by Dr Wilson stated that some of these students in NSW and the ACT were being offered places in teaching degrees with ATARs as low as zero.\n\nProfessor Dinham said the published data may hide more low-scoring school leavers who switch into teaching from other university courses.\n\nUntil recently, the teaching institute published ATARs for a small group of students it said were \"likely selected as a result of other evidence such as their previous ... higher education academic results\".\n\nIts 2014 figures showed that these undergraduates had lower scores (ATARs) than students enrolling on the basis of their performance in secondary education.\n\nProfessor Dinham also told Fact Check that there was \"great variation\" in entry standards and course quality, particularly for undergraduate degrees \u2014 a point that highlights the difficulty in making definitive statements about teacher training as a whole.\n\u2022 SMH, Low ATAR students admitted into teaching degrees on the rise, December 30, 2018\n\u2022 ABC News, Teaching students' highs school marks are dropping, but universities say it doesn't matter, December 2, 2017\n\u2022 Grattan Institute, University attrition: what helps and what hinders university completion?, April 2018\n\u2022 Department of Education, Submission to parliamentary inquiry (sub. 40), December 2018\n\u2022 Australian Institute of Teaching and School Leadership, Data report on initial teacher education, December 2018\n\u2022 Australian Institute of Teaching and School Leadership, Data report on initial teacher education, December 2016\n\u2022 Australian Institute of Teaching and School Leadership, Data report on initial teacher education, December 2015\n\u2022 Natasha Robinson, Students with lowest ATAR scores being offered places in teaching degrees: secret report, September 18, 2018", "lang": "en"}
