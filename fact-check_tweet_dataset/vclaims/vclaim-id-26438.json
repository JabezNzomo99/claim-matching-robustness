Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Photos of UP officials using copper utensils for drinking water in an official meeting. Fact: The photos were taken during an official meeting at Indore Municipal Corporation in Madhya Pradesh, not in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the images in the post were run through Google Reverse Image Search, it was found that those photos were taken during an official meet at Indore Municipal Corporation. Some news websites have published the same photos explaining that the Indore Municipal Corporation has started using copper utensils, in place of plastic bottles, for drinking water.\n\nAlso, similarities in the design of the room and the conference table, and the position of the TV Screen can be seen in the photo posted on Facebook and the Indore Municipal Corporation meeting photo uploaded on the Swachh Bharat website.\n\nTo sum it up, the photos show copper utensils being used by officials at Indore Municipal Corporation (MP), not by UP officials.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
