The restaurant where it supposedly happened doesn\u2019t even exist. \n\n\n\nReligious freedom was back in the news this month when the U.S. Supreme Court decided a case brought against a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because of his religion.\n\nSince then, at least one dubious site has reposted a made-up story riffing on the subject of religious liberty.\n\nA site called forfreedomworld.com posted a story with the headline: \u201cMuslim Waitress Refuses To Seat 27-Person Church Group Because \u2018Religious Freedom.'\u201d It was shared on Facebook, where users flagged it as potentially false. It is.\n\nThe story was originally posted in January on a site called America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which describes its content as satire meant to provoke conservatives.\n\nBefore being published on forfreedomworld.com on June 12, the story had been copied in previous months by at least half\u2013a\u2013dozen other sites, none of which has a satire disclaimer. One site actually claims to share stories that show \u201cthe truth about Islam,\u201d and another has a domain name that sounds like the reputable Time magazine, but is full of click-bait stories and registered to an owner in Albania.\n\nEven on sites that don\u2019t have a disclaimer saying that the story is satire, there are some details that show it\u2019s made up.\n\nFor example, the story claims that the incident happened at a Waffle House in \u201cArnbur,\u201d Michigan. But there is no municipality in the state called \u201cArnbur,\u201d according to the U.S. Census. However, the name does sound similar to Ann Arbor, which is home to the University of Michigan. Also, there are no Waffle House restaurants in Michigan.\n\nSimilarly, the story says that the group of Christians who were refused service were from the \u201cSt. Pleasant Allegorical Church of the Divine,\u201d but there is no such church listed among the more than 33,000 tax-exempt nonprofits in Michigan, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Plus, there is no \u201cSt. Pleasant\u201d recognized by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nMasterpiece Cakeshop v.
