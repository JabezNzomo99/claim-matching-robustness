But, overall, both total employment and manufacturing employment are up since Trump took office in January 2017, and since he signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law in December 2017.\n\nAs of this January, total nonfarm employment was up nearly 4.9 million since Trump took office, and it had increased almost 3 million since the tax law was enacted, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates. In addition, employment in the manufacturing sector is up 454,000 since Trump became president, including 277,000 while the tax law has been in effect.\n\nAlso, weekly earnings, in inflation-adjusted dollars, have been going up under the Trump administration, although Abrams said \u201cwages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living.\u201d (Inflation and the cost of living are not exactly the same, but they are closely related.)\n\nBLS data show that, as of December, real (or inflation-adjusted) average weekly earnings for rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers have gone up 2.6 percent since Trump took office, and almost 1.4 percent since the tax bill became law in December 2017.\n\nSimilarly, the average real weekly earnings of all private-sector workers have increased by 2.6 percent during Trump\u2019s tenure, and nearly 1.4 percent since December 2017.\n\nWe recently wrote about a similar claim when Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential candidate, said, \u201cThe cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren\u2019t keeping up.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
