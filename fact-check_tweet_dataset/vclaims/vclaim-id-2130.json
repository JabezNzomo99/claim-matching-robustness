An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say. The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds \u2013 literally.\n\nThe story is not only entirely fabricated, but also appears to have been intended as satire, mocking some observers who connect new political developments to Russian interference and follow the ongoing investigations into the alleged ties between Russia and the Trump administration.\n\nThe story was given a new lease on life when it was republished by the fake news sites Conservative Fighter (on 15 May 2017) and Daily USA Update (on 16 May 2017).", "lang": "en"}
