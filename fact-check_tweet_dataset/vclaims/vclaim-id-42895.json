The unnamed woman was \u201caware that similar methods have been used by thieves to mark out homes\u201d, the report said. Police Scotland advised her to keep her dogs safe, however a spokesperson told Edinburgh Live that \u201cno crime has been established and suitable advice was given\u201d.\n\nSPCA (The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Incorporated) New Zealand told AAP FactCheck they had no knowledge of \u201cpet tags\u201d being used in New Zealand to mark for dog theft. \u201cThis is the first they\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nNZ Police also told AAP FactCheck that there is no proof such tactics exist.\n\n\u201cWhile we are aware that these type of rumours exist, we are not aware of any recent activity or sharing of this information,\u201d a police spokeswoman said.\n\nIn 2015, police told Stuff news website that the issue was \u201ca long-running urban myth or hoax\u201d and that \u201cdog owners should not be alarmed by these messages as there is no foundation to the hoax\u201d.\n\nNZ Police recommended that property owners follow their tips on protecting possessions including pets and report any suspicious activity to local police.\n\nSince 2006, all dogs registered in New Zealand for the first time are required to be microchipped except for working farm dogs. A microchip means \u201cthere is less chance of people passing off their dogs as someone else\u2019s,\u201d according to NZ\u2019s Department of Internal Affairs brochure.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. SPCA (The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Incorporated) New Zealand told AAP FactCheck they had no knowledge of \u201cpet tags\u201d being used in NZ as a marker for dog theft, while NZ Police said there is no proof such tactics exist.
