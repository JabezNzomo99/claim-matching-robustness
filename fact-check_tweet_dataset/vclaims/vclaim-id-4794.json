His claim misrepresents how NATO functions and conflates several different measures of the alliance\u2019s military spending.\n\nIn May 2017, The Times\u2019s Peter Baker examined similar claims the president made last year:\n\nNATO has a budget to cover common civilian and military costs, and some NATO-owned assets are also commonly funded when they are used in operations. The United States pays 22 percent of those costs, according to a formula based on national income. None of the NATO allies are in arrears on these contributions. \n\n\n\nMr. Trump is referring imprecisely to a goal NATO has set for each member to spend at least 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its own defense each year. He is correct that only five of the 28 members currently meet that goal, and they are the United States, Greece, Britain, Estonia and Poland.\n\nAccording to the most recent estimates from NATO, the United States spent $618 billion on its own defense last year after adjusting for inflation \u2014 or 3.57 percent of its G.D.P. That\u2019s not quite 4 percent, as Mr. Trump said.\n\nCollectively, defense spending by all NATO members in 2017 came to $917 billion. That means the United States\u2019 spending represented 67 percent of the total.\n\nIt is true that the United States spends more than any other NATO member \u2014 both in total cost and as a percentage of G.D.P. \u2014 on its own defense. It also contributes the most to NATO\u2019s shared costs.", "lang": "en"}
