Identity card belongs to someone else and votes are being cast in the name of another person,\u201d claims the narrative affixed to the video.\n\nThe video is being shared in the backdrop of Muzaffarnagar BJP candidate Sanjeev Balyan\u2019s allegations that people were casting fake votes dressed as burqa-clad women. To support Balyan\u2019s claims, social media was earlier brimming with old images of burqa-clad men being falsely shared as them casting fake votes in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections.\n\n\u201cMuslim women got caught in fraud voting, wearing burqa in Muzaffarnagar in uttar pradesh. Do you beat @narendramodi like this? Where is Election Commission?,\u201d is another caption used to share the video.\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook and WhatsApp alike with the caption \u2013 \u201c\u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u091c\u092b\u094d\u092b\u0930\u0928\u0917\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0915\u093e \u092a\u0939\u0928\u0915\u0930 \u092b\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0940 \u0935\u094b\u091f\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u092a\u0915\u095c\u0940 \u0917\u092f\u0940 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e\u092f\u0947 (Muslim women wearing burqa were caught in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Muzaffarnagar casting fake votes.)\u201d\n\nIf one carefully listens to the video, the woman takes her name and that of her party in the first few seconds. \u201c\u092e\u0948\u0902 BSP\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0936\u0940 \u0936\u0947\u0932\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0901 ,\u201c she can be heard saying. Alt News found that a woman named Shaila Khan was fielded by the Bahujan Samajwadi Party in 2017 as the candidate for Rampur nagar palika chairperson.\n\nUpon searching for \u201cShaila Khan BSP fake voting Rampur elections\u201d, we found that the video currently viral was posted by a YouTube user in 2017 as \u2013 \u201cRampur Nagar Nikay Election Cheating.\u201d\n\nWhile Alt News was unable to locate news articles reporting the alleged incident, we found that Shaila Khan was indeed a BSP worker. A campaign poster of the BSP carried her photograph.\n\nAn old video was lifted from the internet and circulated as an incident pertaining to the ongoing general elections. The woman in the video was a BSP member and not a BJP worker. After BJP\u2019s Muzaffarnagar candidate Sanjeev Balyan\u2019s claim that fake votes were cast in Muzzafarnagar by people dressed up in burqas, this was the second attempt to support his allegation using misinformation.", "lang": "en"}
