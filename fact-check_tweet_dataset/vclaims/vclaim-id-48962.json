Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen the image was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in a blog post published in 2013. In the blog, it can be read that the picture is related to Bangladesh\u2019s Chhatra League (It is the student wing of the Bangladesh Awami League). Also, the picture in the blog has the watermark of \u2018www.SylhetTimes24.com\u2019 (Sylhet is a city in Bangladesh). Another website (\u2018facts of Bangladesh\u2019) has published some other photos related to the posted photo in 2013. The website also mentions that the photo is related to Chhatra League.\n\nAlso, if properly observed, one can see that the individuals in the photos have wrapped their heads with a cloth that looks similar to a Bangladesh flag (Even Awami League Flag and Bangladesh Chhatra League logo have similar colours).\n\nTo sum it up, an old photo from Bangladesh falsely shared as \u2018RSS terrorists in India\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
