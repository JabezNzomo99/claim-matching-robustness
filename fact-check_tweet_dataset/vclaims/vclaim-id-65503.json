A tweet by @gerrydeleo captioned the photo, \u201cIllegal mass gathering , no physical distancing and no face mask..Blatant disregard of the quarantine protocols..So entitled people..\u201d\n\nThe screenshot was from a February 21 newscast, which took place almost a month before the first quarantine measure was imposed in the country. Canoy also debunked the claim in a tweet on July 21, in which he said that the photo \u201cwas taken months ago before the lockdown.\u201d\n\nCanoy's news report was about the candlelight vigil for the renewal of the network\u2019s legislative franchise. Those who attended the vigil wore white and donned ABS-CBN ribbons \u2013 same as the one worn by Canoy on the screenshot. (LOOK: Stars rally in support of ABS-CBN franchise renewal)\n\nThe first enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) measure was imposed in Metro Manila on March 15 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. It was expanded to Luzon on March 17. During this time, strict home quarantine for all households was implemented and transportation was suspended.\n\nRappler earlier debunked a similar claim that said ABS-CBN supporters were flouting quarantine rules in July but used a photo of the protesters taken from a different rally back on February 28.
