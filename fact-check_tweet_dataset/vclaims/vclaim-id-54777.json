This is false, the photo was taken by an Associated Press photographer at Barcelona's airport.\n\n\n\nThis post, published on March 25, 2020, tells the story of \"Sofia and Antonio who worked as nurses in Italy,\" and says they left their own children behind to help treat patients, only to become victims themselves.\n\n\"The picture below was taken while they were working in hospital, few days before Antonio got infected, unaware that this might be their last kiss,\" it says. \"They both died holding each others hand,\" it adds.\n\nSimilar social media posts here, here and here make the same false claim.\n\nALSO READ: No, This Video Is Not Of Italians Praying During The COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe original photo, however, was shot by an Associated Press (AP) photographer on March 12 and appears on the AP Images website here as part of the news agency's pictures of the week gallery.\n\nThe accompanying caption makes clear the location is the Barcelona airport, not a hospital in Italy. AFP found the original photo by using a reverse image search.\n\nThe photo's full caption reads: \"A man and woman kiss in the Barcelona, Spain airport on Thursday, March 12, 2020. President Donald Trump, who had downplayed the coronavirus for weeks, suddenly struck a different tone, announcing strict rules on restricting travel from much of Europe to begin this weekend.
