When the dam gates are closed, the river forms a 100-acre impoundment upstream. There are about 165 property owners in the area whose property abuts the water, according to a 2015 report prepared for the county.\n\nToday, the dam is in poor condition,. The state Department of Natural Resources has ordered the county to keep the gates open until the structure is either repaired or abandoned. That means the lake has been, in effect, drained, and it\u2019s a plain-old river again.\n\nAbele and the County Board have disagreed about how to proceed. Larson himself was a member of the board before he was elected state Senator.\n\nAbele sides with the Milwaukee Riverkeepers, a coalition of environmental groups that wants the dam removed so the river can be kept in its natural state.\n\nYears ago, the North Avenue Dam, several miles downstream, was removed and experts have said the faster current has led to improved water quality, a thriving fish population and new wildlife habitat.\n\nA majority of the County Board disagrees and wants to spend about $3.4 million on repairs and $2.2 million in operating and maintenance costs over the next 20 years.\n\nAs a county supervisor, Larson voted in 2009 to repair the dam. That\u2019s the genesis of the $5 million figure Abele used in the ad. However, in a recent interview, Larson said he\u2019s willing to consider removing the dam.\n\nThat leads us to the image used in the ad. It looks more like Door County than the Milwaukee River. And that\u2019s not the kind of boat or property you\u2019d find in that area.\n\nThe boat pictured is either a fishing boat or cruiser and could be up to 36-feet long, said Charles Plueddeman, an Oshkosh-based freelance writer who focuses on the marine industry.\n\n\"A boat this size could be used on large lakes or offshore in salt water,\" he said.\n\n\"When I looked at the photo my first thought was \u2018this does not look like Wisconsin,\u2019\" Plueddeman said. \"I've not been to that site, but I don't think it would be surrounded by the high, rocky bluffs in this photo. And that would be a very big boat to use on that little impoundment.\"\n\nIndeed, pontoons and jet skis are more commonly found in the area, said Clark Blachly, who owns a nearby home.\n\n\"I have been up and down this river hundreds of times there is nothing remotely like this,\" he said.\n\nWe asked Abele\u2019s campaign manager Tia Torhorst about the image in the ad. She said it was \"stock footage\" and was unaware of where it was shot.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s not the Milwaukee River.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen previous -- admittedly higher profile -- instances of the wrong images being used to make point in a political ad.\n\nEarlier this year, Republican Donald Trump aired a TV ad purporting to show Mexicans swarming over \"our southern border.\" But the footage was of African migrants streaming over a fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla. That claim was rated Pants on Fire.\n\nAn Abele TV ad uses a lakefront image to criticize Chris Larson for supporting $5 million in Estabrook Dam repairs to benefit \"a few wealthy citizens.\" But the photo used is not the Milwaukee River and the boat pictured would be woefully out of place there.\n\nWe rate the claim that the image represents the area Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
