Darden Restaurants employees and their family members have made individual contributions to a leadership PAC, candidates and party committees.\n\nThe hashtag #BoycottOliveGarden trended nationally on Twitter late August after a list of food companies supposedly financing Trump\u2019s re-election campaign went viral. Olive Garden, an Italian-themed restaurant chain, appeared on that list.\n\nSome tweets focused solely on Olive Garden allegedly making campaign donations to Trump. Similar claims also appeared on Facebook. (RELATED: Was Jane Fonda Denied Service At A Restaurant Run By A Vietnam Veteran?)\n\n\u201cOlive Garden is funding Trump\u2019s re-election in 2020,\u201d reads one such post. \u201cIt would be terrible if you shared this and Olive Garden lost business.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant chain took to Twitter Aug. 26 to dispel the rumor.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates,\u201d reads the tweet.\n\nOlive Garden also said in a tweet its parent company, Darden Restaurants, does not donate to \u201cany federal or presidential candidates.\u201d\n\nOpenSecrets.org, a campaign finance database operated by the Center for Responsive Politics, shows that Darden Restaurants has not donated to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. In fact, it hasn\u2019t made any donations through its PAC or otherwise this election cycle, according to the database.\n\nCorporations are prohibited from donating to candidates and party committees, according to the Federal Election Commission. OpenSecrets.org has a similar disclaimer on its profile page for Darden Restaurants. Corporations can, however, make contributions through company-affiliated PACs, but OpenSecrets.org shows all donations associated with Darden Restaurants came from individuals.\n\nDarden Restaurants owners, employees or their immediate family members \u2013 not the company itself \u2013 have contributed a total of $17,332 so far during the 2020 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org. Of that figure, $11,899 went to candidates (all Democrats), $5,000 went to a Democratic leadership PAC and $433 went to party committees.\n\nCandidates that received donations include South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Peter Buttigieg and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Trump has not received any campaign contributions from Darden Restaurants-affiliated individuals so far, according to the database.\n\nOther media outlets and fact-checkers have previously debunked this claim.", "lang": "en"}
