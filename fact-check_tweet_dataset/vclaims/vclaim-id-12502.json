In 2010, an academic wrote in a law journal that the rules stopping sex offenders from adopting should be relaxed. This was reported in the Telegraph, with the headline: \u201cSex offenders including paedophiles should be allowed to adopt, Theresa May told\u201d. This is identical to the wording that is used in the image, with the exception of the word \u201ctold\u201d which has been left out\u2014changing the meaning entirely.\n\nAt the same time, a government review was looking into the Vetting and Barring Scheme (which aimed to prevent \u201cunsuitable people\u201d working with children). But the rules around adoption did not change\u2014sex offenders cannot adopt children.\n\nIn response to the academic\u2019s article, a Home Office spokesman told the Telegraph \u201cIt is safe to say that the vetting review will not be considering allowing paedophiles to adopt.\u201d In 2016, a petition to \u201cforbid Theresa May to allow paedophiles and sex offenders to adopt\u201d was submitted to parliament.\n\nIt was rejected because \u201cIt's already the case that sex offenders and child sex offenders are not allowed to adopt children. We're not sure what else you want the Government to do.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
