The subject line was \"Something worth forwarding.\"\n\nAxelrod began his e-mail with a list of ways that reform provides \"security and stability to those with or without coverage.\"\n\nOne of his claims is that refom \"ends exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays: Insurance companies will have to abide by yearly caps on how much they can charge for out-of-pocket expenses.\"\n\nWe recognize that \"exorbitant\" is subjective, but we thought it would be helpful to research whether Axelrod is right that the plan limits charges that a typical person or family would find excessive.\n\nThe main health care reform bill in Congress does set annual limits on out-of-pocket expenses. That means there's a cap on what people would have to pay in a year for medical costs. And insurance companies won't be allowed to require patients to pay for preventive treatments such as check-ups.\n\nIn the House legislation, outlined in section 122, the annual cap on out-of-pocket expenses is $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family. Those numbers are indexed for inflation.\n\nThe policy would be phased in. Employer-provided policies would have a grace period of five years, as outlined in section 102, before they are required to comply with the caps. If you get a new individual policy through the health care exchange, it would have to comply right away.\n\nWe asked Sara Collins of the Commonwealth Fund about the caps. The Commonwealth Fund is a nonpartisan private foundation that advocates for a better health care system. She said the caps are a good form of consumer protection.\n\nAxelrod is correct that the main health care reform bill requires insurance companies to \"abide by yearly caps on how much they can charge for out-of-pocket expenses.\" But ending \"exorbitant\" out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays? 'Exorbitant' may be in the eye of the beholder. For a family, $10,000 in the course of a year can be a serious financial hit. (The median income for a family of four is $67,000.) Still, the new limits are better than nothing, and health care advocates praise them as an important safeguard for consumers. So we rate Axelrod's statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
