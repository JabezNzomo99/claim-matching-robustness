Knowing all that, it would seem odd to see these four men golfing together in 2020.\n\nAnd yet, a photograph supposedly showing Trump, Bloomberg, Giuliani, and Bill Clinton on the golf course circulated widely on social media attached to a quote from comedian George Carlin: \u201cIt\u2019s a big club, and you ain\u2019t in it.\u201d\n\nThis is a genuine (and cropped) photograph of Trump, Giuliani, Bloomberg, and Clinton on the golf course. It was taken in 2008 at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, New York, during the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation Golf Classic. The uncropped photograph, which was taken by Sabo Robert and is available via Getty Images, also pictured comedian Billy Crystal and former baseball manager Joe Torre.\n\nTrump and Bloomberg also golfed together at this event in 2007.\n\nSome viewers had trouble picturing Trump, a future Republican president, golfing with high-profile Democrats like Clinton and Bloomberg. Others viewed this image in the context of Carlin\u2019s quote and interpreted the photograph as proof that the lines between the leading U.S. political parties aren\u2019t as distinct as they appear to be.\n\nWhile there are certainly differences between Republicans and Democrats, we\u2019ll note that Trump, Giuliani, and Bloomberg have all switched parties at least once in their careers. This isn\u2019t entirely uncommon, however, especially when one\u2019s political career spans decades.\n\nThe viral photograph truly shows Trump, Bloomberg, Clinton and Giuliani golfing together at an event in 2008. Whether or not the photograph shows the \u201cbig club\u201d that you \u201cain\u2019t in\u201d is up to the viewer to decide. Here\u2019s a segment of the Carlin routine from which the quote originated:", "lang": "en"}
