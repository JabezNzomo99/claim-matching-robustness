BODY BAGS were delivered to the ice arena in theberton (sic) \u201c.\n\nThere is an ice rink in Thebarton, Adelaide called IceArenA.\n\nThe post goes on to state: \u201cIt\u2019s being turned into a make shift (sic) morgue\u2026 Please stay home n (sic) be safe\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook post has been viewed over 16,500 times, been shared over 80 times and received over 100 comments.\n\nThe escalating COVID-19 crisis is putting huge pressure on medical systems around the world and on morgues. Spain, for example, has faced an enormous challenge in caring for those infected by COVID-19 and accommodating the bodies of those killed by the virus. The Spanish government has been forced to turn an ice rink into a temporary morgue.\n\nIn Australia, according to a March 28 Canberra Times report, the ACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said that Canberra\u2019s only ice rink could be used as a makeshift morgue, but only in the worst case scenario.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see that happen, but we are planning for the worst, and we need to do that in case it comes to that,\u201d she reportedly said.\n\nSimilar rumours surrounding Adelaide\u2019s only ice rink, the Thebarton IceArenA, previously called Mt Thebarton, have been circulating on Facebook and Reddit since March 27, with posts claiming the rink has received 500 or more body bags in preparation to be turned into a makeshift morgue.\n\nBut Thebarton Ice ArenA manager Tenille Henry-Comley told AAP FactCheck the claims made in the Facebook post and Reddit thread are false and that the ice rink\u2019s chillers have been off since March 29.\n\n\u201cIf we had any morgue being set up here, we\u2019d be pretty silly because we have no way to keep anything cold,\u201d Ms Henry-Comley said.\n\nThe myth that the Ice ArenA will be turned into a morgue has been doing the rounds for years, according to Ms Henry-Comley, who said people regularly ask her if the rumours are true.\n\n\u201cAs far as we know, SA health has never had us in the state emergency plan. Clearly because if something was to happen like that there are much bigger sources of cold storage in the state,\u201d she said.\n\nA SA Health spokesperson confirmed that the IceArenA is not being turned into a makeshift morgue and that ice rink is not a part of the SA Health emergency management plan.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s one of those urban legends that always crop up, but there are no plans for this,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be false. According to an IceArenA spokesperson the Adelaide ice rink has not received 500 body bags in preparation to be turned into a makeshift morgue. False \u2013 The claims made in the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
