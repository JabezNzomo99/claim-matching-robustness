There is, in fact, a line in the Congressional Budget Office report on the American Health Care Act that, at first glance, might suggest premiums will decline by 10 percent.\n\nBut, as we have frequently explained, the reference in the report is compared to current law \u2014 the Affordable Care Act. What CBO does is measure the impact of a proposed law against a current law baseline. So average premiums by 2026 are projected to be roughly 10 percent lower than the baseline for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 but they still would go up.\n\nThe CBO does not actually give a figure for the average premium \u2014 which would not be very helpful anyway, because premiums depend so much on age, geographic location and other factors. The CBO assessment of the American Health Care Act also does not detail the premium baseline that it relied on, but the Fact Checker was able to calculate it through a reference in a 2016 CBO report.\n\nWe then used that baseline to calculate the increase in premiums for a single policyholder at three different ages over the 10-year period detailed in the CBO assessment. You will see that in all three age groups, premiums go up by 2026. For younger Americans, the increase is at a much slower rate, while it soars for older Americans.\n\nCBO does not provide quite enough data to produce a year-by-year chart. If it did, you would see dramatic changes in premiums in the 2019-2020 period. That\u2019s when the ACA\u2019s age ban, which limits the premiums of older Americans to no more than three times the cost paid by younger Americans, would be changed to a 5-to-1 ratio under the GOP plan. So a more complete chart would show a drop in 2020 premium prices for 21-year-olds and a big spike for 64-year-olds. Still, even 21-year-olds would experience higher premiums by 2026.\n\nThese figures do not include the impact of tax credits or subsidies in both laws, though the CBO said the payments are less generous under the AHCA, which would tend to make it harder for people to afford insurance.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that the health-care plans in the ACA and the AHCA are not necessarily comparable. The AHCA would repeal a requirement that plans in the individual and small-group markets have an actuarial value \u2014 the percentage of total costs for covered benefits paid by the plan \u2014 in one of four tiers: about 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent or 90 percent. So, in theory, a health insurer could offer plans that cover less than 60 percent of total costs, which would bring down premiums but also increase deductibles and other cost-sharing payments.\n\nThe AHCA, as passed in the House, would give states the option to alter the health plans even more, but CBO has not scored that yet. We will update this analysis if there are any significant changes to the premium estimates. Update, May 24: The new CBO score was a bit more complex, giving two outcomes, one for states did that not seek a waiver from some ACA requirements and one for states that sought moderate changes in ACA requirements. We have replaced the original charts below with new charts.", "lang": "en"}
