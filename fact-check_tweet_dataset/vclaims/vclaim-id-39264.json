Russian soldiers invaded in 2014, and a referendum was staged under the force of Russian occupation.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "October 18, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-39264", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/putin-crimea-ours-annexation-claim-fact-check/29551420.html", "vclaim": "In his wide-ranging comments at the annual Valdai Discussion Club meeting in Sochi \u2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that Russians are \u201cgoing to heaven as martyrs\u201d in the event of a nuclear holocaust and claims that Wednesday\u2019s Kerch college shooting was the \u201cresult of globalization.\u201d But those remarkable assertions are not what we are fact checking here.\n\nPutin also returned to a perennially contentious topic: the status of Crimea. \u201cCrimea is ours,\u201d Putin said. \u201dAnd why ours? Not because we came and grabbed something.\u201d He stated that people in Crimea voted for a referendum that resulted in the peninsula becoming a part of the Russian Federation - - the \u201cwill of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nPutin further said Russia didn\u2019t need to take anything as \u201cwe have an enormous territory, and we don\u2019t need anything from anyone.\u201d He added: \u201cOf course, we value our sovereignty, our independence. It\u2019s always been that way, for the entire history of our state. That\u2019s in the blood of our people, as I\u2019ve repeatedly said.\u201d\n\nIn an article on Putin\u2019s comments on Crimea, Russia\u2019s TASS state news agency cited the results of the March 16, 2014 \u201creferendum,\u201d in which 96.77% of Crimeans and 95.6% of Sevastopol voters chose to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nBut Putin\u2019s claims that Crimea was not \u201csnatched,\u201d and that Russia does doesn\u2019t need to take territory from anyone have repeatedly been proven false.\n\nAs Polygraph.info previously reported, the Russian takeover of Crimea in February 2014 began when Russian special forces, operating without national insignia, seized the Crimea parliament building and raised the Russian flag. The bloodless invasion by \u201clittle green men\u201d resulted in unmarked Russian soldiers taking control of the Republic.\n\nIgor \u201cStrelkov\u201d Girkin, a leading \u201cself-defense\u201d commander in Crimea and later commander of separatist forces in eastern Ukrainian, admitted in a 2015 interview that members of the Crimean parliament were herded into a chamber at gunpoint and forced to support the annexation.\n\nThe referendum, hastily carried out under military occupation, did not allow for public debate or for political leaders from greater Ukraine to visit the Crimean peninsula. And, in accordance with Ukraine\u2019s constitution, all Ukraine\u2019s citizens should have been given a vote on Crimea\u2019s succession, not only residents of the peninsula.\n\nFurther undermining the referendum\u2019s validity were the two options on the ballot, each of which made it impossible for Crimea to maintain the status quo. As reported by Reuters at the time, those options were:\n\u2022 \u201cAre you in favor of the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a part of the Russian Federation?\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cAre you in favor of restoring the 1992 Constitution and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?\u201d\n\nThe second option, while on the surface different, entailed \u201cgiving Crimea all the qualities of an independent entity within Ukraine \u2013 but with the broad right to determine its own path and choose relations with whom it wants \u2013 including Russia.\u201d\n\nBut even with parliamentarians voting at gunpoint and the public being presented with a referendum shortly after being invaded, the putative results -- with 96.77% voting \u201cyes\u201d in Crimea and 95.6% voting \u201cyes\u201d in Sevastopol -- have been called into question.\n\nTSN.ua, a Ukrainian news site, reported in May 2014 that Putin\u2019s own Human Rights Council accidently posted (reportedly before taking down) the actual referendum results, which allegedly showed that only 30 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot in the referendum. Only half of those \u2013 15 percent of eligible voters \u2013 voted for annexation.\n\nThat report cannot be independently verified.\n\nBut, as Paul Gregory reported in Forbes, a Human Rights Council report that is still accessible online, entitled \u201cProblems of Crimean Residents,\u201d stated: \u201cIn Crimea, according to various indicators, 50-60% voted for unification with Russia with a voter turnout (yavka) of 30-50%.\u201d As Gregory noted: \u201cThis leads to a range of between 15 percent (50% x 30%) and 30 percent (60% x 50%) voting for annexation. The turnout in the Crimean district of Sevastopol, according to the Council, was higher: 50-80%.\u201d\n\n\u200bSo even the overinflated turnout figures have been contradicted by one of Putin\u2019s own consultative bodies.\n\nIn any case, On March 27, 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262, stating that the referendum, \u201chaving no validity, cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol.\u201d The resolution urged all countries \u201cnot to recognize any alteration of the status\u201d of Crimea.\n\nAs for Putin\u2019s claim that Russia was an enormous country that didn\u2019t need to take territory from others? Following the de facto secession of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the wake of the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, the German broadcaster ARD asked Putin if Crimea was the next \u201ctarget\u201d for Russian aggression.\n\n\u201cThe Crimea is not a disputed territory. There is no ethnic conflict there in contrast to the conflict between South Ossetia and Georgia,\u201d Putin replied angrily, demonstrating at the time his own recognition of internationally accepted borders.\n\n\u201cRussia recognized the current borders of today\u2019s Ukraine a long time ago \u2026 The question of \u2018targets\u2019 for Russia only serve as provocation,\u201d he added.\n\nThen, as now, Putin\u2019s statements have proven to be false.", "lang": "en"}
