But as ever, there are various ways of looking at this, depending on the exact data used and comparison made.\n\nThere are also lots of things you could mean by economic \u201cstrength\u201d. We\u2019ve asked the Scottish government what Ms Hyslop was referring to.\n\nShe may have been referring to something like GDP per head. It\u2019s lower in Scotland than in the UK as a whole, but only by 2-3%.\n\nThe Scottish National Party recently published a \u201cScotland\u2019s economy: get the facts\u201d article on its website, which instead of GDP focuses on things like productivity growth, average wages, foreign direct investment and youth unemployment.\n\nIn the absence of any confirmation about the specific measure used we\u2019re taking the narrow approach of looking at Scotland\u2019s GDP, the value of the goods and services it puts out.\n\nRecent GDP estimates show Scotland lagging behind the UK as a whole\n\nScotland\u2019s onshore economy grew by 0.7% in the year leading up to September last year, compared to 2.2% growth across the UK as a whole.\n\nThat\u2019s estimating the value of all goods and services produced in Scotland, excluding North Sea oil and gas, and comparing it with the growth rate of the UK as a whole, including North Sea oil and gas.\n\nScottish government statisticians say that \u201cwhen considering short-term change over time, the UK and Scotland saw similar levels of growth in 2013 and 2014. The UK has seen stronger growth than Scotland in 2015 and 2016\u201d.\n\nEven if you ignore North Sea oil and gas on both sides of the equation, Scotland is still growing more slowly than the UK as a whole. The chart below shows quarter-on-quarter growth since the last Scottish independence referendum in late 2014.\n\nThe quality of these GDP estimates has been criticised recently. For now, they\u2019re all we have to go on. We\u2019re trying to find out more about their reliability.", "lang": "en"}
