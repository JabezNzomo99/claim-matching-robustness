The video shows a group of Sikhs marching on the road. The video shared by one Mohammad Javed on Facebook had garnered over 1.5 million views and over 1,26,000 shares at the time of publishing this story. Several Twitter users have shared the video making the same claim.\n\nThe claim along with the video is false. The video is from November 2019 when a group of Namdhari Sikhs were marching on the occasion of Guru Nanak\u2019s 550th birth anniversary in Punjab\u2019s Sultanpur Lodhi area. A user had commented on the viral video with a link mentioning that the sect seen in the video has issued a clarification on the official page of Shri Bhaini Sahib. In the video, the man can be heard saying that the video in circulation is making fake claim. \u201cThis video is from 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak and Namdharis Sikhs were marching in Sultanpur Lodhi.\u201d Shri Bhaini Sahib had also posted a video of Namdhari Sikhs attending the event at Sultanpur Lodhi on 1 November 2019. We further noticed a car in which \u2018Punjab Police\u2019 (highlighted in yellow) can be clearly seen written on it. \u2018Punjab Police\u2019 can be seen written on a car in the viral video. Sarwan Sigh, DSP Sultanpur Lodhi confirmed to The Quint that it\u2019s not a recent incident and the video is from November last year. \u201cThis march was taken out on the occasion of Guru Nanak Dev\u2019s 550th Birth Anniversary,\u201d he confirmed.\n\nThe Sikh community has shown solidarity with the people protesting at Delhi\u2019s Shaheen Bagh area against the Citizenship (Amendment Act) and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens. The farmers who have come from Punjab brought with them placards written in Urdu which said, \u201cMay brothers never fight again, may 1947 never be repeated again\u201d. Sikh brothers who are on the way to #ShaheenBagh carrying Placard in Urdu. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bhai Sey Bhai Ladney Na Paaye\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Phir Sey 47 (1947) Banney Na Paaye\u00e2\u0080\u0099. pic.twitter.com/eyFO2pYlpX \u2014 Mubashir.Khurram (@infomubashir) February 5, 2020 Apart from 1947, the year 1984 has also made Sikhs to come out in solidarity with the Muslims. According to senior journalist Harmeet Shah Singh, subjected to systematic demonisation followed by a large-scale pogrom in 1984, Sikhs understand deeply the pain of Muslims fearing disenfranchisement. \u201cThe CAA has been brought to divide us. That\u2019s what the government does. It divides the people using such tricks and continues to exploit the poor,\u201d said Harnam Singh, one of the farmers who have come from Punjab. Most of the Sikh protesters in Shaheen Bagh are farmers from districts like Moga, Mansa and Sangrur in Punjab\u2019s Malwa region, the epicentre of agrarian distress in the state.", "lang": "en"}
