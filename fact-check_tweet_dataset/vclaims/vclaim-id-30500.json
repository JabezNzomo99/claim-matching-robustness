But there is little common agreement on definitions, and law enforcement reporting is inconsistent and incomplete. The number of sex workers under the age of 18 recovered by police each year numbers in the hundreds.\n\nBut if you dig into the NISMART report, it shows that only 1,700 kids \u2014 less than one percent \u2014 reported having engaged in sexual activity in exchange for money, drugs, food, or shelter during the episode. David Finkelhor, a University of New Hampshire professor who is director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center and a key author of the NISMART report, said that figure would best represent sex trafficking, though the number is so small in the context of the report that its reliability is suspect.\n\n\u201cGiven that running away has declined, I wouldn\u2019t put any stock in these figures as indicators of what is going on today,\u201d Finkelhor said. A new NISMART report has been completed and is awaiting release by the Justice Department, but he said that it will not break down the data to this level of detail. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be any help to those looking for estimates of juvenile sex trafficking,\u201d he said.\n\nPotterat, who is retired, said the study has not been updated. But he said \u201cin my 30 years on the street with nearly 2,000 prostitutes, I rarely encountered underage prostitutes \u2014 pulp-fiction reports notwithstanding.\u201d He referred The Fact Checker to a colleague, Devon Brewer, who has conducted more recent research. Brewer said that he has studied arrest data from jurisdictions across the country and very few juvenile prostitutes can be found. He speculated that sexually immature women are of little interest to most men who purchase sex.", "lang": "en"}
