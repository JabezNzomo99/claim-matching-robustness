Manglapus, upholding then president Corazon Aquino\u2019s order to bar Marcos from his request to return to the Philippines from his Hawaii exile.\n\nThe decision acknowledged the atrocities committed during Marcos\u2019 rule.\n\nRepublic Act No. 10368 or the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013 declares that the government should \u201crecognize the heroism and sacrifices of all Filipinos who were victims of summary execution, torture, enforced or involuntary disappearance and other human rights violations committed during the regime of President Ferdinand E. Marcos.\u201d\n\nThese include, among others:\n\nAny search, arrest, detention without a valid search warrant or warrant of arrest\n\nAny deprivation of liberty carried out during Martial Law on the basis of issuances and decrees of Marcos\n\nTorture, physical injury, killing and other human rights violations by state forces\n\nViolation of the right to free speech and the right to assemble, even if the violation occurred in the course of \u201cillegal demonstrations\u201d\n\nEnforced or involuntary disappearances\n\nKidnapping and exploiting children\n\nSexual offenses against detained victims or in the course of military/police operations\n\nThe law also said compensation for the human rights victims will be sourced from the P10 billion Marcos ill-gotten wealth, part of what was transferred to the Philippine government through the Dec. 10, 1997 ruling of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court.\n\nBut in the same news conference, Duterte said the plunder of the Marcoses is a different story.\n\nIn 2014, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), whose primary mandate is to recover public funds diverted for private gain by Marcos, announced that it had recovered the remaining $29 million inclusive of interest, which form part of the multi-million dollar Marcos Swiss Bank deposits in two West Landesbank accounts in Singapore that have been frozen since 2003.\n\nIn 20 years, the Marcoses were able to acquire at least $5-10 billion of wealth and expensive valuables from the Philippine government, through its associates, dummies, and cronies, the PCGG said in its website.\n\nSome of such ill-gotten wealth were concealed and transferred from various foreign banks, including those in Switzerland, it added.\n\nMarcos disguised under the name \u201cWilliam Saunders,\u201d while then first lady Imelda used \u201cJane Ryan\u201d in their signature cards in the first ever bank account they opened with Credit Suisse in Zurich, said the PCGG Milestone Report in 2016.\n\nIt added that in 1968, his salary amounted to $5,600, yet his Swiss Bank account had a balance of $950,000. The two fled the country in 1986, leaving $26 billion in debt.\n\nIn a 2003 report by the Ombudsman on Asset Recovery and Mutual Legal Assistance, through an anti-corruption initiative by the Asian Development Bank, it was found that the Marcos case \u201cwas not a simple theft but rather a complex, intricate and systematic plunder of the government\u2019s coffer.\u201d\n\nTo date, none of the Marcoses have been convicted for what they have allegedly plundered.\n\nSources:\n\n Duterte won\u2019t change mind about Marcos burial at Libingan\n\n Marcos v.
