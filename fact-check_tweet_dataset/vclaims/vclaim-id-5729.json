Browning\u2019s report of the incident was released earlier today. It stated:\n\n\u201cI had been called to the apartment building for a domestic disturbance. When I got there, the adjacent apartment had their door open. There was a black male sitting on the floor. He said something to me in a hostile manner. Something like, \u2018go away!\u2019 I could tell that he was going to be aggressive. When I saw him reach for the object, I knew it was going to be him or me. My kind is Not welcomed in these kind of neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nThe object in question turned out to be Gibson\u2019s pacifier and the door had been opened because the apartment\u2019s superintendent had not yet fixed the apartment\u2019s air conditioner so Gibson\u2019s mother was letting a cool breeze in. She was on the phone watching Gibson from the kitchen. She apparently couldn\u2019t see who he was talking to, but stated that, \u201cif she had known it was the police, she would have closed her door immediately and took her child to sit in the bathtub with her until everything settled down.\u201d\n\n\u2026 Meanwhile, conservative talk show host Bradley Stanley has come out stating that Gibson was indeed \u201ca thug with a long rap sheet which included having a potty mouth and not eating his vegetables so there\u2019s no doubt that Gibson was talking back to the officer who was in fear of his life.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
