But that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nFor starters, the sign notes that this wage is \u201cbased on position and availability.\u201d In other words, this wage isn\u2019t available to all new hires. Furthermore, Chick-fil-A restaurants are individually owned, meaning wages vary depending on location. While some Chick-fil-A franchises may offer similar wages to those featured on this sign, the wage is not a company-wide policy.\n\nThis photograph was taken at a Chick-Fil-A in Pleasanton, California. In July 2019, this Chick-fil-A location posted a similar flyer to their Facebook page:\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only Chick-fil-A restaurant that is offering close to $17 an hour. Another Chick-fil-A restaurant in Sacramento, California, raised its starting wage to $17 hour.\n\nEric Mason, owner of the Sacramento Chick-fil-A, told a television station in June 2019 that he was hoping to attract \u201chospitality professionals\u201d with his new wage offer.\n\nThe owner of a Chick-fil-A location in Sacramento, California, calls it a \u201cliving wage.\u201d In Eric Mason\u2019s view, that would be $17 or $18 an hour, which is what he vows he\u2019ll be paying his workers, starting Monday, June 4. The rate represents a sizable increase for employees now making $12 to $13 an hour. \u201cAs the owner, I\u2019m looking at it big-picture and long-term,\u201d Mason told a local news station. \u201cWhat that does for the business is provide consistency, someone that has relationships with our guests, and it\u2019s going to be building a long-term culture.\u201d\n\nWhile at least two Chick-fil-A restaurants are truly offering starting wages close to $17 an hour, this pay is not available at all Chick-fil-A locations. According to Payscale, a company that surveys employees and employers for information about wages, the average hourly rate for a Chick-fil-A employee is about $10 an hour.\n\nA spokesperson for the company told us that because Chick-fil-A restaurants are individually owned, franchise owners set their own wages:\n\nWhile the wage mentioned on the above-displayed sign does not apply to all Chick-fil-A locations or positions, the company truly does offer \u201cscholarship opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe company writes on its website:", "lang": "en"}
