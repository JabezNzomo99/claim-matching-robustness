A poster for the film shared by Netflix in August 2020 showed the girls in the dance group wearing short shorts and crop tops and engaging in various provocative poses. (The offending poster can be viewed here.)\n\nWe learned that Netflix did indeed commission this poster. Its release was followed by outrage, with many arguing that it was inappropriate and sexualized young girls.\n\nThe version commissioned by Netflix was vastly different from the poster used for the French theatrical release in April:\n\nNetflix tweeted an apology on Aug. 20 that stated that:\n\nWe\u2019re deeply sorry for the inappropriate artwork that we used for Cuties. It was not OK, nor was it representative of this French film which premiered at Sundance. We\u2019ve now updated the pictures and description.\n\nThe film, which won the World Cinema Dramatic Directing Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2020, tells the story of a Senegalese Muslim girl named Amy living in Paris. According to some reports, Netflix\u2019s original description of the film indicated that Amy \u201cbecomes fascinated with a twerking dance crew.\u201d The description of the film on the company\u2019s website now reads: \u201c11-year-old Amy starts to rebel against her conservative family\u2019s traditions when she becomes fascinated with a free-spirited dance crew.\u201d\n\nBased on the outcry and Netflix\u2019s subsequent apology, we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
