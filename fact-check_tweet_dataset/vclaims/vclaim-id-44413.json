Keith Ellison\u2019s girlfriend\n\n\"Democrat KEITH ELISON (sic) the first MUSLIM in Congress beats his girlfriend and the dems make him the Deputy Chair of the DNC. Let that sink in..\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nEllison previously served as deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee before he stepped down in November 2018 after winning the race for Minnesota\u2019s attorney general.\n\nBut the post falsely insinuates that he was appointed deputy chair after being accused of abuse, when he had held the position since 2017, before the allegations came to light.\n\nThe rest is also murky.\n\nThe woman in the shared photo is not his ex. We ran a reverse-image search and found that the picture has appeared online since at least 2012, and has often been used on various websites as a visual representation of domestic abuse with the same caption tag, \"He says it won\u2019t happen again,\" attached.\n\nIn September 2018, Ellison\u2019s former girlfriend, Karen Monahan, alleged that he had physically abused her.\n\nIn August of that year, Monahan\u2019s son wrote a lengthy Facebook post that claimed he saw a video of Ellison abusing his mother. Monahan confirmed her son\u2019s account. She hasn\u2019t released the video.\n\nIn a statement, Ellison acknowledged the two were in a relationship that ended in 2016, but denied abusing her or that such a video existed.\n\nMonahan retained a lawyer to represent her around October 2018, but little information has come out since.\n\nNevertheless, the post inaccurately suggests Ellison is guilty and that Democrats made him the DNC\u2019s deputy chair after the allegations became public knowledge.\n\nWe rate this Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
