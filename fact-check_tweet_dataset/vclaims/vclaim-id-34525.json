This updated version uses a more recent Ashcroft Poll from September 2019. The result is a change of conclusion from \u201cInaccurate\u201d to \u201cAccurate\u201d.\n\nCLAIM: There is 51% support for a united Ireland.\n\nCONCLUSION: ACCURATE. Although the Sinn Fein manifesto didn\u2019t declare the exclusion of \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d, this revises a 45/46/9 split to a rounded 49/51 split between staying in the UK and leaving the UK and joining the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIn their 2019 Westminster election manifesto, Sinn F\u00e9in claimed the following in section, \u201cLooking to the Future\u201d:\n\n\u201cIn a recent opinion poll in the north carried out on behalf of the Tory peer, Lord Ashcroft a majority of those polled said that if there was a referendum on Irish unity tomorrow, they would vote in favour of unity.\u201d\n\nLord Ashcroft published the following graphic on Twitter, which shows 51% response \u201cfor Northern Ireland to leave the UK and join the Republic of Ireland\u201d and 49% response \u201cfor Northern Ireland to stay in the UK\u201d. The graphic includes a statement that \u201cfigures shown exclude those who answered \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 or \u2018would not vote\u2019\u201d. This qualifying statement was not published in the Sinn Fein manifesto.\n\nThe figures are cited from a survey by Lord Ashcroft, where 1,542 adults in Northern Ireland were interviewed online between 30 Aug and 2 Sept 2019. Results were weighted to be representative of all adults in Northern Ireland.\n\nOne of the survey questions was, \u201cIf there were a \u2018border poll\u2019 tomorrow, how would you vote?\u201d The responses are shown in the following table:\n\nFirstly, it is incomplete to quote a percentage for a smaller number of options without acknowledging that fewer options are being taken into account than were captured in the poll or survey.\n\nNevertheless, excluding the \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d enables one to say \u201cfor those who expressed a preference\u201d, 49.45% chose the option \u201cfor Northern Ireland to stay in the UK\u201d and 50.55% chose the option \u201c\u2026 join the Republic of Ireland\u201d. Rounding up these figures to the nearest per cent results in a 49/51% split between staying or leaving the UK.\n\nThe online blog, Northern Slant, published an article that reviewed a previous Ashcroft survey as well as three others that asked people their voting intention in a referendum on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland: \u201cWhat do the latest polls tell us about Northern Ireland\u2019s future?\u201d The four surveys were:\n\nThe results are summarised in the following graphic, which includes \u201cundecided/don\u2019t know\u201d respondents: \n\n Source: https://www.northernslant.com/what-do-the-latest-polls-tell-us-about-northern-irelands-future/\n\nThe more recent Ashcroft Poll survey (September 2019) is significant in that it shows a majority support for the option for \u201cunited Ireland\u201d.\n\nIn its manifesto for the 2019 General Election, Sinn Fein made a statement and published a graphic that claimed there was 51% support for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and join the Republic of Ireland, without declaring that there were \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d responses.\n\nAn analysis of the cited Ashcroft Poll (September 2019) shows a 45/46/9 split between staying in the UK, leaving the UK, and \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d. Excluding the \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d results in a rounded 49/51 split between staying in the UK and leaving the UK and joining the Republic of Ireland.\n\nImage: Photo by Chris Dorney used by license Dreamstime.com\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
