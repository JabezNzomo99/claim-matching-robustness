Unable to reach an agreement with Congress, Trump instead did an end run around that body and resorted to signing directives of questionable legality and effectiveness, as The New York Times reported:\n\nPresident Trump took executive action to circumvent Congress and try to extend an array of federal pandemic relief, resorting to a legally dubious set of edicts whose impact was unclear, as negotiations over an economic recovery package appeared on the brink of collapse. It was not clear what authority Mr. Trump had to act on his own on the measures or what immediate effect, if any, they would have, given that Congress controls federal spending. But his decision to sign the measures \u2014 billed as a federal eviction ban, a payroll tax suspension, and relief for student borrowers and $400 a week for the unemployed \u2014 reflected the failure of two weeks of talks between White House officials and top congressional Democrats to strike a deal on a broad relief plan as crucial benefits have expired with no resolution in sight.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics responded by circulating a purported tweet from 2014, in which Trump had supposedly criticized his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for doing what he himself would do in August 2020 (i.e., \u201csubverting the Constitution of the U.S. because he is unable to negotiate with Congress\u201d):\n\nIn this instance the tweet was no fabrication or prank, but something Trump really tweeted on November 20, 2014, just after Obama announced he would be making a series of administrative changes to the immigration system. The tweet remains visible on Trump\u2019s Twitter timeline:", "lang": "en"}
