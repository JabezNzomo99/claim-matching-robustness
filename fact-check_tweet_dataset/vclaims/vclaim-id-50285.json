Please RETWEET!\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Schumer ever tweeting or deleting the statement. A spokesman from his office confirmed the tweet was fabricated.\n\nThe Senate minority leader has taken to Twitter on several occasions to criticize the Trump administration\u2019s response to the novel coronavirus outbreak. In late January, Trump signed an order temporarily barring most foreign nationals who had visited China recently from entering the U.S., according to The New York Times.\n\n\u201cThe premature travel ban to and from China by the current administration is just an excuse to further his ongoing war against immigrants,\u201d reads a Feb. 5 tweet Schumer purportedly deleted. \u201cThere must be a check and Balance on these restrictions.\u201d\n\nBut the statement does not appear in ProPublica\u2019s archive of the Senate minority leader\u2019s deleted tweets on Feb. 5 or any other date. Vijaya Gadde, the global lead for legal, policy and trust and safety at Twitter, noted it appeared to be fake on Feb. 28.\n\nJustin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the tweet was fabricated: \u201cHe never tweeted it and therefore could never have deleted it.\u201d (RELATED: Did The Vatican Confirm Pope Francis Has The Novel Coronavirus?)\n\nSome websites erroneously circulated the fake tweet. For instance, the blog Powerline originally portrayed it as real in a February 29 post but later issued a correction, saying, \u201cI regret not verifying the authenticity of the deleted tweet before posting this. I\u2019m declaring it a hoax.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
