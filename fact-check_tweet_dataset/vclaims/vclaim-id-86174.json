Using cherry-picked numbers, he claimed a drop of 40 percent, then 61 percent, and then 78 percent. \u201cUnder past administrations, the border didn\u2019t go down \u2014 it went up,\u201d he falsely claimed.\n\nThe president stuck to the 78 percent statistic for months, even when his own fuzzy accounting was out of date. Then he was silent for months as apprehensions began climbing until he rolled out a new claim: \u201cWe have set records on arrests at the borders.\u201d\n\nBoth claims are from the same data maintained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It\u2019s just that Trump flipped the script, twisting the data to present the rosiest picture possible. Whereas a drop in arrests previously was cause for celebration, now a surge in arrests is even better.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, even as 325,000 jobs were added during the month the two parties held political conventions, Trump depicted the U.S. economy on the edge of ruin, with soaring unemployment of greater than 40 percent and a \u201csilent nation of jobless Americans\u201d with 92 million people on \u201cthe sideline outside the workforce.\u201d He derided unemployment numbers as phony.\n\n\u201cPeople wanting to get jobs is a mess, despite the numbers,\u201d he said two months after taking office. \u201cYou know, you hear numbers, but you have millions of people out there that want to get jobs, they can\u2019t get jobs, because we don\u2019t have good jobs.\"\n\nBut within months, the numbers that were once suspect became a badge of honor. He almost immediately started taking credit for job growth, often backdating to November 2016, when the election took place, even though he took office more than two months later. That allows him to pad the job numbers by more than 400,000.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created 4.5 million new jobs since the election, a number that was unthinkable,\u201d Trump asserted during a Nov. 2 rally in Huntington, W.Va. \u201cIf I would have said that during the campaign, oh they would have given me a hard time. They would have said Pinocchio.\u201d\n\nIn reality, slightly more than 4 million jobs have been added since Trump became president \u2014 and he promised to create 10 million in his first term, so he\u2019s behind schedule. The economy added more jobs in every year of Obama\u2019s second term than it did in Trump\u2019s first year, though Trump is on track to match Obama in his second year.\n\nTrump\u2019s shift in statistical emphasis is aided by his allies in the right-leaning media. The March 2017 jobs report, showing a gain of 235,000 jobs, was greeted by a Drudge Report tweet of \u201cGREAT AGAIN.\u201d A similar-sized monthly gain in jobs under Obama a year earlier earned downcast reviews on Fox News. Stuart Varney, one Fox personality, said there was \u201creason to question the quality of the jobs in this latest jobs report.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetorical shift also has been helped by the fact that the economy has kept humming along, in contrast to the economic crisis that greeted Obama when he became president. The unemployment rate fell from a peak of 10 percent under Obama to 4.9 percent by the time Trump took office. That was the best unemployment rate in eight years, but it would not have been apparent when Trump spoke about the unemployment statistic during his pursuit of the presidency.\n\nThe unemployment rate hovered around 4.9 percent for Trump\u2019s first year, but then dropped to 3.9 percent in April. The difference was not huge but it was the best monthly number in 18 years, during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. Then it fell slightly more, to 3.7 percent, in September, the lowest level since December 1969 \u2014 almost 49 years.\n\nTrump is never shy to brag but now he had an even better talking point as he told audiences that \u201cAmerica is winning again\u201d like never before. \u201cThe national unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent,\u201d he told a political rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa. \u201cYou believe that one? 3.7 percent, the lowest in 50 years, five-oh, 50!\u201d\n\nBut inconvenient numbers are simply ignored. During the 2016 campaign, Trump regularly brought up the federal budget deficit. It had been cut in half during Obama\u2019s second term, but that was not good enough for Trump. \u201cWe have budget deficits that through the roof,\u201d he said, promising to lower and even eliminate them.", "lang": "en"}
