The disturbing video showing the heinous mob attack on a naked woman was from Bihar.\n\nThe incident took place last year in August. But there was no communal angle to the incident. The victim woman was not a Christian police officer.\n\nThis video on YouTube has been viewed by more than 47,000 people and liked by over 4,000.\n\nThe video was also uploaded by a Facebook page \"FunToon\". One user \"Shahnawaz Ahmad\" had also posted it on Twitter.\n\nThe same video had surfaced earlier on social media with another fake communal claim. Fact Checker \"BoomLive\" had debunked the claim at the time.\n\nThe incident shown in the video clip happened on August 20, 2018 and it created a national outrage on the media over Bihar's law and order situation.\n\nThis was widely reported by several national and international media.\n\nAccording to these reports, a woman was thrashed and paraded naked by a mob in Bhojpur district on the suspicion of being involved in the murder of a local youth. This report along with video of the incident can be seen here.\n\nAs per these reports, the incident had neither any relation to any religion nor any communal angle to it.\n\nYouTube channel \"Veer\" is run from Pakistan and has been subscribed by over 2.5 lakh people.\n\nThe contents on the YouTube channel are quite inciting and deliberately done to stoke up communal hatred by using misinformation.\n\nAs per the information given on the Facebook page \"Veer\", he is a resident of Rawalpindi, Pakistan.\n\nThis YouTube channel is a classic example of how social media platforms are sometimes used deliberately by some people to propagate communal hatred in the country from across the border.", "lang": "en"}
