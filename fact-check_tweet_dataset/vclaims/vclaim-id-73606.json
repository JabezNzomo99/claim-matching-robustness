It comes from the writings of clergyman William J. H. Boetcker.\n\nThe post shares a lengthy quote, purportedly from Lincoln, that lists a set of \u201ccannot\u201d principles. It has been shared over 55,000 times since being posted on July 29.\n\nHere is the full quote attributed to Lincoln in the Facebook post:\n\nYou cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot lift the wage earner up by pulling the wage payer down. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. You cannot build character and courage by taking away people\u2019s initiative and independence. You cannot help people permanently by doing for them, what they could and should do for themselves.\n\nThere is however, no record of Lincoln saying or writing the long quote in his collected works. Two experts \u2013 The Lincoln Forum Chairman Harold Holzer and University of Illinois Springfield historian Michael Burlingame \u2013 confirmed to Check Your Fact via email that the quote didn\u2019t originate with Lincoln. Holzer called the attribution \u201cfake,\u201d while Burlingame said, \u201cThat quote is bogus.\u201d\n\nCheck Your Fact traced the quote back to a set of maxims written by Boetcker known as \u201cThe Ten Cannots.\u201d Boetcker published a booklet called \u201cInside Maxims\u201d in 1916 that contained an early version of the ten principles, according to the Baltimore Sun. The Library of Congress in 1950 also reported that the maxims come from Boetcker, not Lincoln.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be no way of overtaking the rapid pace with which the mistaken identity has been spreading,\u201d the Library of Congress noted. (RELATED:Did Abraham Lincoln Say, \u2018Things May Come To Those Who Wait, But Only The Things Left By Those Who Hustle\u2019?)\n\nThe misattribution likely started after Boetcker published a leaflet that had a real Lincoln quote on one side and his \u201cTen Cannots\u201d on the other, according to Edward Steers Jr., author of \u201cLincoln Legends: Myths, Hoaxes, and Confabulations Associated with Our Greatest President.\u201d Steers noted in his book that at some point the \u201creprinting of the ten points resulted in dropping Boetcker\u2019s name, leaving the reader to conclude the ten points were Lincoln\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe words have been misattributed to Lincoln for many years, with politicians such as President Ronald Reagan and former Ohio Gov. John Kaisich falsely crediting Lincoln with saying them.", "lang": "en"}
