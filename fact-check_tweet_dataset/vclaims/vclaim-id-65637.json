They died in 2015 during a training mission in Florida when a Black Hawk helicopter crashed in dense fog. Four National Guard soldiers were also killed.\n\nThough there was a more recent fatal training exercise involving Marines, this Facebook post misuses the images of and deaths of seven men who perished five years ago.\n\nWe rate this post Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
