The youngest child reported to the NCA was 12 years old, a little older than primary school age.\n\nMedia reports suggest that children as young as nine are being used by gangs to distribute drugs\u2014we\u2019re looking into this.\n\nThere were over 15,000 people found guilty of an offence relating to the production or supply of drugs in 2016. Around 83% were over the age of 21, 4% were aged between 15 and 17 and 0.1% were between 12 and 14.\n\nOverall offences recorded by police in England and Wales relating to trafficking drugs have increased slightly in the last year. There were over 25,000 in the 12 months to September 2017, an increase of 1% compared to the year before.\n\nRecent improvements in the way the police record crime may mean that some of this increase is only down to more offences being recorded, rather than more offences actually happening.\n\nBetween 80% and 90% of all drug offences relate to possession rather than trafficking of drugs.", "lang": "en"}
