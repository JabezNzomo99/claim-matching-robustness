Be careful if you are drinking tap or stream water without boiling it.\n\n\u201cAlways boil your water before drinking. Please forward this message to everyone, especially to those who drink tap water.\u201d\n\nThe see-through creatures are in fact\n\nin the \u201cleptocephalus\u201d larval stage, during which they are transparent and flat. (\u201c\n\n\u201d comes from the Greek and Latin for \u201cflat head\u201d.)\n\nMarine eels and their relatives in the Elopomorpha superorder all go through this early\n\nThey look transparent because\n\n\u201cjelly-like substances on the inside, with a thin layer of muscle with membranes on the outside\u201d, says\n\nIn his 2009 article on the \u201c\n\n\u201d, author Michael J Miller says the eel larvae \u201cgrow much larger than typical fish larvae\u201d.\n\nThey can range from 5 centimetres to 30 centimetres \u2013 the length of a school ruler. And they look so different from their adult forms that \u201cfor about a century they were thought to be a unique type of marine fish\u201d.\n\nCoca-Cola hoax using the same photos\n\ndebunked a hoax that used the same photos of the eel larvae. This time the claim was that Coca-Cola had recalled much of its Dasani bottled water \u2013 sold in the US \u2013 after the \u201ctransparent creatures\u201d were found in the bottles.\n\nCoca-Cola denied that it had issued a recall, saying the \u201csource of the hoax was false\u201d.\n\nAccording to Snopes, the US Food and Drug Administration said they were \u201cunaware of any recalls associated with the Dasani water bottles\u201d.\n\nSea eel larvae won\u2019t find their way into your tap\n\n, a South African company that purifies dirty water, if the eel larvae could end up in tap water.\n\nColin Basch, the company\u2019s MD, said it wasn\u2019t at all likely. That\u2019s because the immature eels live in the sea \u2013 not rivers and dams, where tap water comes from.\n\nAnd if they did land up in water headed for taps, normal water purification processes would get rid of them.\n\nIn Basch\u2019s words: \u201cBased on the strict\n\nof the water involved and the fact that the \u2018creatures\u2019 are normally ocean bound, it is highly unlikely that these would appear in potable water from taps.\u201d\n\nUnlikely to be found in taps anywhere\n\nTap water first goes through screening, chlorination and other treatment processes, Basch said,\n\n\u201cbefore being piped to the various domestic suppliers which supply the tap water to the public\u201d.\n\nHe said most municipal water suppliers would use similarly strict treatment processes, and it was unlikely that the \u201ctransparent creatures\u201d would be found in tap water anywhere in the world.\n\nDo boil unsafe water \u2013 or clean it in other ways\n\nYou\u2019re unlikely to get baby eels in your tap water, but the meme still has good advice.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure about the quality of the water coming out of your tap, don\u2019t hesitate to boil it before you drink it.\n\n\u201cBoiling the water generally kills pathogens, viruses and bacteria,\u201d Basch said.\n\ndrink water from a river unless you purify it first.\n\u2022 1 teaspoon of bleach to 20 litres of water , and leave for at least 2 hours\n\u2022 None Add iodine (but not if you\u2019re allergic to it) \u2013\n\u2022 None Use the sun to purify the water \u2013 \n\n\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid of \u201ctransparent creatures\u201d in your tap water.\n\nBut, as the meme says, do \u201cbe careful\u201d of drinking unsafe water before boiling it. \u2013", "lang": "en"}
