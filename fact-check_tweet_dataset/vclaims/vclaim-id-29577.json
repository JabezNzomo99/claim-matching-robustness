Below is a screenshot of the claim.\n\nOther domains which contain the same claim include news5.latestnewstv.info, supertrend.wikibunny.info, balitangtotoo.info, and articles.thetmz.info. These sites have clickbait content directing to articles full of ads. The video is also clickbait; it requires one to share it first to Facebook before the video can be fully viewed.\n\nThe Facts: The video embedded in the websites is a report about a rape case in Bulacan, not in Cebu. It was uploaded by GMA News on July 14, 2018, on its official YouTube account.\n\nThe thumbnail which appeared in the posts also came from a different source. Based on a reverse image search done by AFP Fact Check, this leads to a YouTube video on August 30, 2018, showing a group of teenagers who were arrested for using marijuana.\n\nAccording to an Inquirer report, witnesses told authorities in Lapu-Lapu City that 3 men were seen with Silawan before she was found lifeless last Monday, March 11. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting factcheck@rappler.com.
