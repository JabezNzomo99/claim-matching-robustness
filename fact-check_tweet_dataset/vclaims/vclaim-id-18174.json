That\u2019s reasonable, but finding out what the wealthiest own is harder than you might expect.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-18174", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/wealth-uk-richest-1-and-poorest-20/", "vclaim": "Wealth in the UK: The richest 1% and the poorest 20%\n\nMeasuring wealth inequality is hard, and wealthy people don\u2019t always disclose their wealth when asked. So no estimate is perfect.\n\nGiven what we do know, the claim is reasonable.\n\nIt\u2019s is based on a study funded by Credit Suisse that\u2019s well regarded by academics.\n\nIn fact, that study concluded that the richest 1% own 29 times what the bottom 20% own, so saying \u201cmore than 20 times\u201d is a cautious summary.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about inequality, you have to choose how much you care about different kinds of inequality. Imagine the owner of a large country estate that doesn\u2019t make a lot of money. They are way up the wealth scale, but not necessarily high up the income scale. So wealth inequality is just one part of the picture of inequality generally.\n\nOxfam has made this claim about people. That\u2019s not really what the research estimates. It estimates the wealth of households.\n\nThat would make a difference to the claim, but probably wouldn\u2019t make Oxfam\u2019s claim unjustified.\n\nNobody publishes data on how wealth is distributed between individual people, although the Office for National Statistics told us that they would like to do so at some point in the future.\n\nThe wealth the claim is estimating includes what you have (property and physical things), what you have in the bank, and what you have in your pension pot.\n\nLooking at all these parts of wealth makes a difference. If you only looked at money in the bank, you\u2019d find that altogether the bottom 20% of households were in financial debt, and so the comparison with the top 1% wouldn\u2019t be so useful.\n\nThere is no single right answer\n\nThe Office for National Statistics pointed us to a recent report by academics, which emphasised that information on wealth inequality in the UK is \u2018seriously incomplete\u2019 and that it\u2019s particularly hard to measure the wealth of the very rich.\n\nThey looked at four main ways of estimating wealth, which all have problems:\n\u2022 Waiting until people die and looking at the value of their estates\n\u2022 Looking at the tax people pay on their investments\n\u2022 Asking people, through surveys like the Wealth and Assets survey\n\u2022 Looking at lists of very rich people, like the Sunday Times Rich List and the Forbes list of billionaires\n\nThe main government source of information on wealth in the UK is the Wealth and Assets Survey from the Office for National Statistics. The review found that wealthier people are less likely to answer these kinds of surveys and more likely to under-report their wealth.\n\nSo the academics concluded that \u201cgiven the limitations of each of the different sources, it is important to make use of all available approaches\u201d to understand the wealth of the very rich, and studies like the Credit Suisse one attempt to do that by using the information from the rich lists to fill in the gaps.\n\nWealth is not everything\n\nThe Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank, pointed out in response to Oxfam\u2019s release that when people talk about inequality, they\u2019re more often referring to income than wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s an important difference. By one common measure, adult wealth inequalities in the UK are about twice as high as income inequalities.\n\nInequality of wealth won\u2019t be a perfect measure of other ways of looking at inequality either, such as inequality of opportunity. For example, a university graduate might have such large financial debts that their overall wealth is very low, as measured by the combined value of their physical possessions, property, bank balance and pension pot.\n\nSo, overall wealth inequality between rich and poor isn\u2019t the only type of inequality worth considering.\n\nWe updated this article on 22 September, explain in more detail what methods had been used to estimate the figures.", "lang": "en"}
