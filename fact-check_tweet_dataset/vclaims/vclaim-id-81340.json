Bush\u2019s Iraq war but instead be more akin to President Bill Clinton\u2019s four-day attack that ended on Dec. 19, 1998 \u2014 just as the House of Representatives voted articles of impeachment against him for the Monica Lewinsky matter.\n\nWith support from the United Kingdom, the United States launched the attacks (mostly in the form of cruise missile strikes) in an effort to \u201cdegrade\u201d Iraq\u2019s ability to make weapons of mass destruction. Officials claimed that almost all of the targets were hit, as Iraq offered virtually no resistance. (The country had been under years of sanctions and large parts were under U.N.-mandated \u201cno-fly\u201d zones.)\n\n\u201cNot a single U.S. or British casualty has been reported in about 70 hours of intensive airstrikes involving 650 sorties against nearly 100 targets. A total of 415 cruise missiles were launched,\u201d The Washington Post reported. \u201cOfficials in Washington said there was essentially no Iraqi response to the raids besides the artillery used in an attempt to shoot down incoming cruise missiles.\u201d\n\nFor many years, conservative critics mocked Clinton\u2019s 1998 strikes as ineffective\u2014and much of the discredited intelligence used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq assumed that Iraq had kept its programs going after the attacks. But it was later discovered that Desert Fox was the coup de grace that ended Iraq\u2019s ability and motivation to manufacture weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\u201cWe think Desert Fox is a very close comparison. It serves as an analogy of the intent, execution and objective for that type of operation [long-range strike to target weapons facilities],\u201d said Caroline Rabbit, Cotton\u2019s communications director. \u201cThen and now, there existed the possibility of retaliation and the possibility that the initial campaign would not degrade WMD facilities to the planned level. Then and now, those contingencies had to be considered and planned for. Further, there have been notable advances in ordinance capabilities, particularly precision-targeting and ability to effectively strike hardened targets, that would allow us to take out Iranian facilities more effectively than when Desert Fox occurred.\u201d\n\nThere is little doubt the United States is probably the only country that could degrade Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, though the effect might only to be to delay the program by one or two years. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the United States has upgraded and tested its largest bunker-buster bomb, known as Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), after earlier tests had concluded the 30,000-pound weapon was not powerful enough to destroy some of Iran\u2019s most important facilities. Multiple MOPs, with precision targeting, likely would be needed to destroy the buried and hardened facility at Fordow.\n\nThe biggest possible flaw in Cotton\u2019s analogy is that Iran likely would not be as passive as Iraq. A 2012 analysis of a possible U.S. strike, by Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and Abdullah Toukan of the Strategic Analysis and Global Risk Assessment Center, concludes \u201cthe aging Iranian airforce will definitely be no match\u201d for U.S. forces. But there were other significant risks:\n\n\u201cAfter you\u2019ve dropped those bombs on those hardened facilities, what happens next? What happens if they decide, in their hardened shelters with their mobile missiles, to start launching those? What happens if they launch them into U.S. bases on the other side of the gulf? What happens if they launch into Israel, or somewhere else? Into a Saudi oil field? Into Ras Laffan, with all the natural gas? What happens if they now flush their fast patrol boats, their cruise missiles, the [unclear] full of mines, and they sink a tanker, an oil tanker? And of course the economy of the world goes absolutely nuts. What happens if they activate sleeper cells? The MOIS, the [Iranian] intelligence service \u2014 what happens if another preemptive attack by the West, the U.S. and Israel, they fire up the streets and now we got problems. Just tell me how to deal with all that, okay? Because, eventually, if you follow this all the way down, eventually I\u2019m putting boots on the ground somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator Cotton is correct that U.S. strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities would look more like Operation Desert Fox than the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan which is the analogy many critics of military action invoke. The strikes in Operation Desert Fox took place over four calendar days and that would be more than enough time to destroy Iran\u2019s key nuclear facilities and related targets,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, a key difference is that, unlike Iraq in 1998, Iran would almost certainly retaliate militarily with ballistic missile strikes in the region, by encouraging terrorist and proxy groups to conduct attacks, and by harassing and attacking ships in the Persian Gulf.\u201d\n\nCotton is largely correct that four days of intensive bombing would likely deal a blow to Iran\u2019s nuclear program. But his analogy minimizes the potential for retaliation and regional blow-back far different from the muted reaction of a beleaguered Iraqi regime. Iran would almost certainly strike back, in potentially deadly ways, against U.S. aircraft, personnel and allies.\n\nWe wavered between One and Two Pinocchios. We understand he was countering the notion of an invasion\u2014which is absurd\u2014but he should also acknowledge that this would not be cakewalk. Iran is not Iraq, after all, and that makes such historical analogies so facile.", "lang": "en"}
