Experts, whose research the Lib Dems used, emphasise that projections like this are subject to a large degree of uncertainty.\n\nIt\u2019s far too early to categorically say\u2014as Jo Swinson did\u2014that \u201cwe know that that remain bonus will be \u00a350 billion that we can spend on public services\u201d.\n\nWhat have the Lib Dems done?\n\nThe Liberal Democrats shared their calculations with us. They produced estimates of how much UK GDP would grow by over five years in a Brexit deal scenario, and in a scenario where we remained in the EU. This was based largely on analysis from the independent think tank Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and Citi Bank.\n\nThe Lib Dems found that, based on their calculations, GDP would be 1.9% higher in a Remain scenario than under a Brexit scenario.\n\nThey then calculated how much higher GDP growth under Remain might translate into extra income for the government (known as public sector receipts)\u2014through things like more revenue from taxes. GDP is the value of all goods and services produced in a country; it\u2019s expected to grow in both the Remain and Brexit deal scenarios, but by more in the former.\n\nThe Lib Dems have looked at what public sector receipts are expected to be, as a percentage of GDP, over the next few years, to estimate how much more the UK government would have in its account each year in the Remain scenario\u2014where GDP is higher overall\u2014than in the Brexit deal scenario. This works out at just over \u00a350 billion over the next five years or\u2014on average\u2014\u00a310 billion each year.\n\nWhile this doesn\u2019t seem to have factored in inflation, even when you do it still works out at around \u00a350 billion. The Lib Dems also said that their calculations factored in the fact that in a Remain scenario the UK would have to continue paying its EU membership fee.\n\nThe Lib Dems argue that this additional money could be put into public spending. For context, total UK public spending is expected to be \u00a3824 billion in 2019/20, so this hypothetical \u201cremain bonus\u201d is a relatively small in comparison.\n\nThese are reasonable estimates, but also very uncertain ones\n\nPaul Johnson, Director of the IFS, said of the Lib Dems\u2019 calculation: \"We could expect the economy to be bigger if we were to remain and this assumes a relatively modest effect if anything, although obviously subject to a huge amount of uncertainty\".\n\nThe uncertainty point is important. GDP growth can be affected by a number of factors both global and domestic.\n\nThe IFS and Citi call their growth estimates \u201cpotential paths for the UK economy\u201d and point out that things like different election outcomes could change those paths. The IFS told us that if, for example, a decision to remain in the EU was followed by intense political pressure to leave or have another referendum, this could create more economic uncertainty and affect GDP.\n\nSo the Lib Dems\u2019 \u00a350 billion figure is a reasonable indication of what additional money a government might have to spend over the next five years, if we remain in the EU compared to if we leave with a deal.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that the calculation is based on projections of GDP growth which themselves are highly uncertain, and so it\u2019s far from definitive.", "lang": "en"}
