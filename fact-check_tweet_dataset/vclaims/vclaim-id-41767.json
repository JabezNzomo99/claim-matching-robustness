He said his and his institution\u2019s names are being used \u201cto spread false accusations and misinformation.\u201d\n\nWarning of misinformation amid the current pandemic, which has affected over three million people worldwide and killed more than 211,000, Honjo said: \u201cThe broadcasting of unsubstantiated claims regarding the origins of the disease is dangerously distracting.\u201d\n\nThe fake social media post says Honjo \u201ccreated a sensation\u201d with the claim, but there are no news reports of him saying such a thing. In his most recent media engagements with The Mainichi and Nikkei Asian Review, no such claim was made either.\n\nVERA Files Fact Check has flagged at least seven netizens and one FB page \u2014 the verified account of a former government official of Nigeria \u2014 posting the fabricated status update on April 25. The earliest emergence online of the erroneous claim that the virus came from a lab could be traced back to an April 4 comment in a forum on academic social networking site ResearchGate.\n\nThe fabricated post also claimed Honjo worked four years in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, where cases of COVID-19 first emerged. However, his profile on the Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine website shows no such record.\n\nThe fake post surfaced on public social media pages about a week after another Nobel prize winner, French virologist Luc Montagnier, claimed April 17 in a media interview that the novel coronavirus was \u201ccreated in a laboratory.\u201d The same day, the office of French president Emmanuel Macron said there is no evidence so far of a link between a Wuhan laboratory and the origins of COVID-19.\n\nThe posts bearing Honjo\u2019s fake quote have an accumulated 14,100 reactions, 1,800 comments, and 13,000 shares from netizens.", "lang": "en"}
