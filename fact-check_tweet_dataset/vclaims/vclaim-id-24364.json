Lewis once stated, \u201cYou are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Lewis ever said or wrote this statement.\n\nLewis, one of the most renowned authors and theologians of the 20th century, is well known for fiction like \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia,\u201d as well as his musings on Christianity, including \u201cThe Problem of Pain.\u201d\n\nThough he is frequently quoted on the internet, there is no evidence that Lewis said or wrote the phrase attributed to him in the Facebook post. Michael Ward, a Lewis expert and author of \u201cThe Narnia Code: C.S. Lewis and the Secret of the Seven Heavens,\u201d told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that the quote is not genuine.\n\nIt does not appear in \u201cThe Quotable Lewis,\u201d a book that contains more than 1,500 verified quotes from the writer, or any of his writings. The C.S. Lewis Foundation features the quote on a section of its website titled \u201cQuotes Misattributed to C.S. Lewis.\u201d\n\nThe foundation credits motivational speaker Les Brown with coining the expression. The website Quote Investigator agrees, tracing it back to his 1992 book \u201cLive Your Dreams.\u201d\n\nLewis did once write about goals, saying, \u201cProgress means getting nearer to a desired goal and therefore means not being there already. You don\u2019t want the London train to go on progressing after it reached London!\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
