While many people know him for his paintings, like his 1931 piece \u201cThe Persistence of Memory,\u201d he also produced work in sculpture, photography and writing.\n\nHowever, nowhere in his writings does the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post appear. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched his short stories, books and screenplays for the quote but found no matches.\n\nThe DCNF also reached out to several experts, none of whom were able to provide a definitive citation in Dali\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cIt is so often mentioned but it\u2019s quite possible it\u2019s not correct,\u201d Elliott King, an art historian with expertise in Dali, told the DCNF in an email.\n\nThe website Quote Investigator found a precursor to the statement in a 1908 article by Walter Cottingham, though elements of the expression appeared earlier. An exact match for the quote was published in the 1997 collection \u201cReader\u2019s Digest Quotable Quotes,\u201d where it was attributed to \u201cC. Archie Danielson,\u201d according to Quote Investigator.\n\n\u201cThe quotation appeared in an alphabetical listing of quotations in which statements from Dali and Danielson were contiguous,\u201d speculates Quote Investigator. \u201cAn ascription was listed below each quotation. An inattentive reader grouped the quotation with Dali instead of Danielson by looking above the expression instead of below.\u201d\n\nDespite the lack of evidence linking the quote to Dali, it is still widely attributed to him on the internet.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
