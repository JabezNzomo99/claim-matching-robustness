No evidence yet\n\nSeveral posts shared on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp claim that the body of a missing boy was found beneath the altar of a church in Ondo State, Nigeria. However, there is no evidence to support the claims, although criminal charges have been opened in connection with the child\u2019s disappearance.\n\nA video shows the Sotitobire Miracle Centre church in Akure, capital of the southwestern state of Ondo, set on fire by a mob. It was posted here on December 18 and it accompanies claims that the head of the church, Prophet Alpha Babatunde, had confessed to his role in the disappearance of Gold Kolawole.\n\n\u201cBody of the boy was found under alter (sic) in the church,\u201d the post further claims.\n\nIt was shared more than 256 times and viewed more than 41,000 times in less than 24 hours after being posted, according to data from Facebook.\n\n\u201cAnd today after the boy was exhumed from the alter (sic) of the church, the church was set ablaze,\u201d reads another post, which we\u2019ve archived here. It correctly explains that the rampage followed Gold\u2019s disappearance from the church creche during a November service which his mother attended.\n\nThe post, repeated here, has been viewed more than 70,000 times. It was posted to a Nigerian Facebook page \u201cGist, News, Relationship\u201d, which has nearly 5,000 followers.\n\nA similar claim, which was posted here, has been shared 177 times and viewed by at least 63,000 times.\n\nOther posts shared here, here and here repeat the claims, including via this Twitter user with more than 130,000 followers.\n\nGold\u2019s whereabouts are still unknown. Police deny his body was ever recovered from the church.\n\nState police spokesperson Femi Joseph confirmed the church was set ablaze on 18 December, an attack linked to media reports alleging the boy\u2019s body was exhumed from beneath the church\u2019s altar. But, he said, there was \u201cnothing like that\u201d.\n\nA separate statement by police further added: \u201cIt is most unfortunate that this misleading information, spearheaded by a popular TV station, has ignited spontaneous reactions from the people, leading to wanton destruction of properties and injuries to many.\u201d\n\nAt least 10 suspects have been arrested and detained for allegedly looting the Sotitobire church during the mob attack. \u201cSotitobire\u201d is a Yoruba (in Nigeria) word meaning \u201ctell of his greatness\u201d.\n\nWhat does the family say happened?\n\nGold went missing from the church creche on 10 November during a service, according to police. His disappearance was also reported here.\n\nGold\u2019s mother, Modupe Kolawole, told AFP in an extended interview that she and her husband Temitope (see family picture below) joined the church in June. She said she was reluctant to leave her son at the creche because he was too young and yet to walk.\n\nHowever, she said, she finally relented and placed Gold with the creche for the first time on November 10, while she attended a service next door.\n\nDuring the service she checked on him twice -- the second time at about 11.45 am. He was nowhere to be found, she said, alleging that all 14 carers from the creche \u201cwho had gone to dispose of refuse at that time\u201d had no idea where he was.\n\n\u201cWhen I demanded my child back, I was told that maybe someone took him along to play with,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it was 3.00 pm, I hadn\u2019t seen my child and the pastor was yet to be informed.\u201d\n\nReports of Gold\u2019s disappearance reached Babatunde, founder of the church (see below), at the end of the service. Modupe said the case was reported to authorities.\n\nFour weeks later and with Gold still missing, his parents alerted Nigeria\u2019s State Security Service (SSS), leading to Babatunde\u2019s arrest on 10 December.\n\nBabatunde, who was detained in the SSS custody for thirteen days, hit back with a lawsuit in the state\u2019s Federal High Court, demanding his release and a sum of 100 million naira ($278,000) in damages \u201cfor the violation of his fundamental rights\u201d.\n\nOn 23 December, authorities arraigned him before a Magistrate's Court in Akure and levelled two kidnapping charges against him and several associates, in connection with Gold\u2019s disappearance (see official charge sheet below).\n\nPeter Anjorin, a member of the church and a close associate of Babatunde, faces a third charge for allegedly destroying evidence.\n\nThe court was adjourned to 17 January, 2020, for further investigation. Babatunde remains in custody at Olokuta Correctional Centre following an order by Magistrate Charity Adeyanju who presided over the case.", "lang": "en"}
