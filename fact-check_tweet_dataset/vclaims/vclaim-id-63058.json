This request proved somewhat controversial, however, as Trump had thus far refused to wear a mask in public during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, despite recommendations from health officials.\n\nThe majority of videos and photographs from the visit showed Trump touring the facility, delivering a speech, and speaking with Ford executives \u2014 all without a face covering. So when a photograph emerged supposedly showing Trump wearing a face mask during this visit, some viewers were surprised and skeptical of the sight:\n\nAs it turns out, this is a genuine photograph of Trump wearing a face mask during part of his visit to a Ford manufacturing plant in Michigan.\n\nExecutive Chairman Bill Ford confirmed that Trump \u201cwore a mask during a private viewing of three Ford GTs from over the years. The president later removed the mask for the remainder of the visit.\u201d\n\nMark Truby, Ford chief communications officer, said, \u201cThe subject of a face mask came up.

Trump told reporters that he wore a mask in the \u201cback area,\u201d but that he removed his mask because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.\u201d Trump then showed the press his mask and said that he took it off because he was giving a speech:", "lang": "en"}
