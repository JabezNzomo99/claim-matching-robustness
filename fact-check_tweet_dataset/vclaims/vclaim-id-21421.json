In some cases they abandoned their cars after fuel ran out.\n\nA Sept. 4 post on Facebook appears to show U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez using this moment to promote an initiative aimed at curbing climate change \u2014 but it\u2019s a fake image of her Twitter account.\n\n\"I see people are rushing out to fill up their cars for this hurricane at the gas station,\" begins what looks like a screenshot of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweet. \"This wouldn\u2019t be an issue if they had electric cars. If the power is out for a week how are they going to get gas? We need to start planning ahead and moving forward.\"\n\nThis post, which has been shared more than 2,600 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We also didn\u2019t see it on Politwoops, which tracks deleted tweets by public officials.", "lang": "en"}
