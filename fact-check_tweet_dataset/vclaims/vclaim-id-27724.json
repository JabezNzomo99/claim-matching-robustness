Capturing and exporting the whales is illegal in the U.S.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "February 11, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-27724", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-whale-prison-us-china/29764269.html", "vclaim": "Yuri Trutnev, the Russian president\u2019s plenipotentiary representative in the Far East Federal District and a deputy prime minister claimed on February 6 the United States have taken control of \u201cChinese markets,\u201d selling captive wild whales to China. Trutnev, who earlier served as Russia\u2019s minister of natural resources and ecology, spoke at a TASS news agency press conference in Moscow.\n\nTrutnev\u2019s comments came in response to a reporter\u2019s question about the predicament facing 11 orcas and 90 beluga whales captured in the wild and kept in what the Russian officials say is an \u201cadaptation base\u201d in the Srednyaya Bay, in the Sea of Japan (Pacific Ocean) in Russia's Far East. The whales are held to be sold to Chinese public entertainment marine parks.\n\nAnimal rights activists and scientists said the \u201cadaptation base\u201d is a \u201cwhale prison,\u201d where the conditions are \u201ccruel and inhumane.\u201d The Animal Welfare League warned that \u201ctime is running out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the largest number of sea creatures to ever be held in small temporary enclosures. Some of them have been there since July,\u201d states an online petition by Change.org calling for the release of the orcas and beluga whales. Some 782,800 people have signed the petition in the two months since it was posted.\n\nFifteen of the belugas are baby whales, according to Lora Beloivan, a reporter for the Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta who visited Srednyaya Bay.\n\n\u201cI cannot not hate you,\u201d Beloivan wrote that she told base personnel after inspecting the enclosures where the whales are kept.\n\nThe TASS news agency, one of Russia\u2019s oldest government-owned media outlets, did not stream video of Trutnev\u2019s press conference or post a transcript online, filing only several reports on his positive comments about developments in the Far East District.\n\nHowever, the head of Sakhalin Environment Watch, Dmitry Lisitsyn, posted on his Facebook page a video fragment from the Q&A, during which a journalist asked Trutnev about the situation with the \u201cwhale prison.\u201d\n\nTrutnev dismissed there was any issue involving captive animals and claimed that the problem is economic in nature \u2013 namely, \u201cunfair competition\u201d from the United States, which, he claimed, is pushing Russia out of the whale market in China while selling wild orcas and belugas to the Chinese for entertainment display.\n\nThe Russian deputy prime minister\u2019s claim is false. Aside from humanitarian concerns, environmentalists say the \u201cwhale prison\u201d violates Russian law, and in the U.S. whales are protected by law.\n\nLisitsyn and others say that the belugas and orcas were captured illegally and that the Russian government must act to save them. On February 1, three NGOs, including Sakhalin Environment Watch, filed a lawsuit against three Russian government agencies, alleging that under Russian law, they are obligated to confiscate illegally captured wild animals and return them to their natural habitat.\n\nAs for the U.S., \u201cthe claim is completely false,\u201d Naomi Rose, a marine mammal scientist at the Animal Welfare Institute in Washington, DC, told Polygraph.info. She added that she has been working on the issue of Russia capturing whales and dolphins for years.\n\n\u201cClearly, if the Russian deputy prime minister makes a statement like that publicly, he believes it, but it simply not true,\u201d she said.\n\nCapturing marine mammals for the public display is allowed only with a permit, she said: \u201cGetting a permit to conduct such captures is a public process and the public, including myself would know about it. It is impossible for it to go on hidden.\u201d\n\nRose added: \u201cEverywhere \u2026 there are whales in the United States, there are a lot of people watching these animals, including the U.S. government. It is required by the law that there be biologists out there, counting these animals, doing surveys. There is no way anybody could be capturing these animals illegally, and there is no legal market whatsoever in the United States for these animals for public display. Nobody is capturing these animals for public display.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., whales are protected under various laws as well as international agreements. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 includes a \u201cmoratorium\u201d \u2013 a complete cessation of the \u201ctaking of marine mammals.\u201d Any actions \u201cto harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal\u201d are prohibited and considered criminal.\n\nThe Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a framework for conservation and protection of endangered and threatened species and their habitats.\n\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITIES), an international agreement drafted in Washington, DC in 1973 and signed by 183 parties, protects all whales, including belugas and orcas.\n\nAccording to the Center for Biological Diversity non-governmental organization, a U.S. ecological watchdog, only 75 such orcas remained in the West Coast ocean habitat of the U.S. as of 2018.\n\nThe watchdog sued President Donald Trump\u2019s administration last August for \u201cfailing to protect the last remaining\u201d orcas suffering from starvation due to a lack of salmon, boat traffic and water pollution.\n\nCatherine Kilduff, a representative of the Center for Biological Diversity, told Polygraph.info that her organization has \u201cnever heard\u201d of such capturing and trading of whales in the United States during the last decade. \u201cIt is illegal and if anything like that happened, that would be a shock. It is not true,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the United States, beluga whales are only found in Alaska. Commercial and sport hunting of belugas is banned for everyone except Alaska Natives, who reportedly last hunted belugas in 2005.", "lang": "en"}
