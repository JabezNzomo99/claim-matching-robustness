According to the report, an FIR has been registered under IPC sections 505 [2] for publication or circulation of rumour and relevant sections of the Information Technology Act. The report further stated, \u201cno action has been taken against the channel so far\u201d.\n\n\n\nMeerut police had tweeted that the video is not from the district.\n\nWith the help of Invid, Alt News broke the video into multiple frames and found that the video has existed on the internet at least since November 2015.\n\nThe video shared on social media is 26 seconds long, whereas the clip posted above is an extended version of 57 seconds. French television station France 24 had debunked this video in March 2017 when it was viral with the claim that it depicted xenophobic attacks in South Africa. \u201cIt was published in November 2015 on YouTube (and has since been taken down). In the video some words of Portuguese can be heard and it has appeared on several user accounts based in Brazil, suggesting that it is another video of score-settling, but this time in a favela in Rio.\u201d, reported France 24.\n\nMexican news websitePeri\u00f3dico e-consulta published an article on November 26, 2015, which also stated that the video is from Brazil. While Alt News could not independently verify the location, it is certain that the video is not from India.\n\nIn conclusion, a video supposedly from Brazil, as per foreign media, was shared with the false narrative that it depicted a gruesome murder in Meerut.", "lang": "en"}
