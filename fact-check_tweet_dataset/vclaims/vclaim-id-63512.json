A version of the Microsoft Windows logo appears in the center of the outline of the virus.

Hinting at a link between Bill Gates and the virus?\u201d\n\nHowever, the image has been digitally altered. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller found the unedited photo in the 2006 book \u201cCrop Circles: Signs, Wonders and Mysteries.\u201d The crop circle, purportedly created in Wiltshire, England, in 2004, actually shows a \u201cstunning six-armed star,\u201d according to the book.\n\nOther photos of the original crop circle appear on Temporary Temples, a website that documents crop circles through photography. The website\u2019s Facebook page addressed the photoshopped image in an April 30 post.\n\n\u201cThis image doing the rounds is Photoshopped taken from a full page photograph which was included in our book Signs Wonders and Mysteries,\u201d the post reads. \u201cIt has been done by an individual who is well known for posting manipulated images, usually using my photographs.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time social media users have attempted to link Gates to the new coronavirus, which first emerged in late 2019. In January, a viral Instagram post falsely claimed a \u201cvaccine-production institute\u201d funded by Gates owns the patent for the virus.", "lang": "en"}
