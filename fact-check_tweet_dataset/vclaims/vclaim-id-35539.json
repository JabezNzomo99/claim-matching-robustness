The misleading footage was shared shortly after Turkey launched ground offensive against Kurdish forces in Syria. The video has been doctored to include the banner; AFP has previously debunked similar edited footage of banners hanging on a Trump Hotel; Greenpeace denied any involvement in the purported stunt, saying the video was \u201ca computer generated animation\u201d.\n\nThe video was published in this Twitter post on October 10, 2019. It has been viewed more than 1.2 million times within six hours.\n\nThe 22-second video purports to show the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, which is owned by US President Donald Trump's Trump Organization.\n\nA banner hanging on the side of the building reads \u201cBETRAYED AND MURDERED THE KURDISH PEOPLE. Greenpeace\u201d. People chanting \u201cnot my president\u201d and \u201cTrump this shit\u201d can also be heard in the background.\n\nThe video's caption states: \u201cHappening right now at the Trump Tower Hotel in Las Vegas. #KurdsBetrayedByTrump\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe video was posted hours after Turkey launched ground offensive against Kurdish forces in Syria following a series of air strikes and artillery fire. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan announced the operation three days after his US counterpart Donald Trump decided to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. Here is an AFP report about the developments.\n\nThe video was also viewed thousands of times here and here on Facebook, here and here on Twitter, here and here on Instagram and here on YouTube alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has been doctored to include the banner.\n\nAFP has previously debunked similar false claims about Greenpeace banners being unfurled at the same Trump hotel.\n\nThose misleading videos showed the same building with doctored banners that read \u201cCONCENTRATION CAMPS\u201d and \u201cHAS A LITTLE MUSHROOM DICK\u201d.\n\nTwitter user @paulleeticks told AFP via Twitter direct message on July 7, 2019, that he filmed the original video and edited it to include the banner.\n\n\"Yeah I edited it and shot the original vid,\" he told AFP.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the other doctored videos (C and R):\n\nThe banner in the video in the October 10, 2019, misleading posts has \u201cGreenpeace\u201d written at the bottom right corner.\n\nIn an email to AFP on October 10, Greenpeace denied its involvement: \u201cThis was a computer generated animation and not executed by Greenpeace.\u201d\n\nThe environmental group, which previously said the similarly doctored videos included in the AFP fact-check report were \u201cfake\u201d, also tweeted the clarification on October 10.", "lang": "en"}
