He has in the past referred to his statements about not leaving office at the end of his term as \"jokes.\"\n\nWhen asked directly by a reporter during a Sept. 23, 2020, press briefing whether he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power, \"win, lose, or draw\" in the upcoming November election, Trump refused to do so.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump caused a bit of an outcry on Sept. 23, 2020, when he was asked during a press briefing at the White House whether, \u201cwin, lose or draw,\u201d he would commit to \u201ca peaceful transferal of power after the election.\u201d\n\nPlayboy reporter Brian Karem posed the question because Trump had for months made statements about serving more than the two terms allowed for a president by the Constitution. Trump has claimed that those comments were jokes.\n\n\u201cDo you commit to making sure that there\u2019s a peaceful transferal of power?\u201d Karem asked.\n\nTrump answered, \u201cWe want to have \u2014 get rid of the ballots and you\u2019ll have a very trans \u2014 we\u2019ll have a very peaceful \u2014 there won\u2019t be a transfer, frankly; there\u2019ll be a continuation.\u201d\n\nDuring a briefing the following day, ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl asked White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany several times to clarify the president\u2019s comments from the day before.\n\n\u201cIf the president loses this election, will this White House, will this President assure us that there will be a peaceful transfer of power? It\u2019s a very simple question. We\u2019ve been doing it since 1800,\u201d Karl stated.\n\nMcEnany gave a long answer but stated he would accept the results of a \u201cfree and fair election\u201d:\n\nThe President will accept the results of a free and fair election. But I think that your question is more fitting to be asked of Democrats who have already been on the record saying they won\u2019t accept the results of an election. In fact, I have several of them here for you. South Carolina Democrat Jim Clyburn has said that Trump \u201cis not going to win fairly.\u201d Senator Barbara Boxer has said that the only way Trump will win is to \u201csteal it.\u201d That\u2019s according to Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer. The Washington Post has noted \u2014 they have a headline: \u201cDemocrats may not trust the results of the election if Trump wins.\u201d And then you have that beautiful quote from Hillary Clinton that \u201cJoe Biden should not concede under any circumstance.\u201d So I think your fitting is more ques- \u2014 more a fitting \u2014 a fitting question for Democrats.\n\nTrump has been making unfounded statements to the effect that mail-in voting, which will play a key role in the November 2020 election due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are prone to widespread fraud.\n\nQuestions about whether Trump would peacefully leave office swirled for months in the lead-up to the 2020 election. In mid-June, social media users shared posts saying Trump had once suggested he won\u2019t leave office at the end of his elected term, prompting readers to ask Snopes if he actually said such a thing.\n\nThe queries appeared to be based on a speech Trump gave in December 2019 at the Israeli-American Council [IAC] National Summit, during remarks about his administration\u2019s controversial decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In the rambling speech, Trump addressed his friend, billionaire businessman and campaign donor Sheldon Adelson, and stated the new embassy building would be constructed with \u201cJerusalem stone.\u201d\n\nIn the comments, Trump also appeared to be deriding his critics, who had expressed fears that he would not willingly leave office if termed out, or if he lost reelection. Here are his exact words:\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, but think of this. Think of this, right? So we\u2019re going to spend $2 billion. It wouldn\u2019t be built, Sheldon, for 10 years, fif- \u2014 don\u2019t forget: At some point, whether it\u2019s 5 years from now, 9 years from now, 13 years from now \u2014 I\u2019m doing this to drive the media crazy. (Applause.) Because a lot of them say, \u201cYou know he\u2019s not leaving, don\u2019t you?\u201d One of these characters \u2014 these people are so stupid. One of them said \u2014 one of them said, \u201cYou know he\u2019s going to win, don\u2019t you? And you know, at the end of his second term, you know he\u2019s not leaving. He\u2019s not leaving. You know that.\u201d And I thought he\u2019s a comedian. I thought he was kidding. He\u2019s for real. So now we have to start thinking about that, because it\u2019s not a bad idea. (Applause.) No, but these people are going crazy. When they all scream, \u201cFour more years, four more years,\u201d I always say, \u201cMake it 12 years and you\u2019ll drive them crazy.\u201d Twelve more years. But if I don\u2019t get the build- \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) But if I don\u2019t get the building built, it\u2019s never going to get built because you\u2019re going to have some guy like Obama or Crooked Hillary.\n\nIn June 2020, Trump told Fox News he will leave office to \u201cgo on, do other things\u201d if not re-elected. And while he has claimed previous comments raising doubts about his willingness to leave should he lose the November 2020 election were jokes, we didn\u2019t see any hint of levity in his statements at the Sept. 23 press briefing.\n\nWe therefore rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
