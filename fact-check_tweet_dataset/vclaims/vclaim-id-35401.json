The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the photo to be morphed. Though the kid is indeed Dalai Lama, but the viral picture was created by superimposing his childhood picture on the image of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nMany Facebook users have shared the photoshopped image believing it to be true. The photo has been viral on Internet for the last few years.\n\nUpon reverse searching the viral photo, we found that it has been created by using two separate photos - one of Gandhi and the other of young Dalai Lama.\n\nWe found this picture of Gandhi on \"Getty Images\". The picture was taken on November 3, 1931, when he visited Downing Street in London to attend a conference on Indian constitutional reforms. At that time, Dalai Lama was not even born.\n\nThis photo is available on the website of \"Dalai Lama\" (https://www.dalailama.com/the-dalai-lama/biography-and-daily-life/birth-to-exile). As per the website, the photo was taken at Kumbum Monastery in Amdo, eastern Tibet, when Dalai Lama was only four years old. Dalai Lama was born on July 6, 1935.\n\nIn 2007, the Hindustan Times quoted Dalai Lama as saying that he never met Mahatma Gandhi in his life but once saw him in a dream.\n\nIn 2017, Boom Live had also debunked this morphed photograph.", "lang": "en"}
