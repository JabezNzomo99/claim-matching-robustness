Similar claims about Soros paying protesters have previously circulated in 2015 and 2018.\n\nHowever, the flyer does not appear to be authentic. Both the Open Society Foundations and the Thurston County Democrats have said it is fabricated. (RELATED: Was Kavanaugh Accuser Deborah Ramirez A Soros Fellow?)\n\n\u201cThis poster is a complete fabrication, and we\u2019ve seen how dangerous disinformation can be,\u201d a spokesperson for the Open Society Foundations said in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nVictor Minjares, the chair of the Thurston County Democrats, wrote a lengthy post on Facebook denying that the flyer was real.\n\n\u201cFalse and forged images are being spread nationwide that say, \u2018Get paid to be a professional anarchist,'\u201d Minjares wrote. \u201cThis disinformation displays TCD\u2019s phone number and an incorrect TCD email/web address. THESE IMAGES ARE FAKED TO DISCREDIT DEMOCRATS.\u201d\n\nThe DCNF found no record of Open Society Foundations awarding grants for such action, and there is no evidence the flyer is authentic. We rate this claim false.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
