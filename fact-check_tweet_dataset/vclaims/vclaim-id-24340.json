And he is also a Dalit. May God give such a husband to all those daughters who find him to be a good person!!\n\nThe above message has gone viral on Facebook, along with a video of a man shouting, swearing and threatening another person. The video begins with the man yelling, \u201cAkhilesh Yadav ka sipahi hoon\u201d (I am a soldier of Akhilesh Yadav- translation). Uniformed police personnel can also be seen in the video, which is 3:10 minutes long.\n\nThe above post by a Facebook user has been viewed over 122,000 times so far, and shared over 1400 times. The video and accompanying message have been shared mostly by individual users. It may be noted that Sakshi Mishra, daugher of BJP MLA from Bareilly, UP Rajesh Mishra, had taken to social media alleging that her father was opposed to her union with her husband Ajitesh Kumar, who belongs to the Dalit community. Allahabad High Court had later asked the police to provide security to the couple.\n\nAlt News broke up the video into several frames and reverse-searched one of them on Google, which yielded no result. Alt News then reverse-searched the image on Yandex, and found a blog about the incident. The blog was titled \u2018\u0905\u0916\u093f\u0932\u0947\u0936 \u092f\u093e\u0926\u0935 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0939\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0917\u0941\u0902\u0921\u0908, \u0925\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0926\u0940\u0902 \u092d\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0940 \u0917\u093e\u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902\u2019 (Goondagiri by Akhilesh Yadav\u2019s man, abused police personnel inside thana- translated). According to the blog, the name of this person is Vaibhav Gangwar.\n\nIn order to dig more information, we searched Vaibhav Gangwar on Google and came across a news report by Patrika dated September 4, 2018. According to the report, the person in question is a leader of the youth wing of the Samajwadi Party. He was involved in a land dispute, over which he was apprehended by the police and sent to Kila thana in Bareilly where he created a ruckus, yelling, swearing and even threatening to get policemen transferred. The entire incident was captured on mobile phone by one of the policemen present inside the thana. Gangwar was arrested after the video went viral on social media. The same was reported by other media organisations including News18.\n\nIn conclusion, it may be stated that the person seen in the viral video is NOT the husband of Sakshi Mishra as claimed. The video is of September 2018 and the person in the video is a SP leader.", "lang": "en"}
