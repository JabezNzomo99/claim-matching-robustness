The worldwide toymaker announced the $4 billion deal Thursday to buy British company Entertainment One, which produces animated kids shows such as \u201cPeppa Pig\u201d and \u201cPJ Masks\u201d but also owns the rap label.\n\nWhile it may seem a bit odd for one company to preside over both Mr. Potato Head and recordings of Tupac Shakur, this is a genuine news report.\n\nThe toy company Hasbro acquired the British company Entertainment One for $4 billion in August 2019. In addition to getting access to children\u2019s programs such as \u201cPeppa Pig,\u201d Hasbro also now owns Death Row Records\u2019 catalog.\n\nDeath Row Records was started by Suge Knight, The D.O.C., and Dr. Dre in 1991. While this label was once a major player in the industry and is practically synonymous with West Coast rap, Death Row filed for bankruptcy in 2006. The company changed hands a few times over the years until Entertainment One acquired it in 2013.\n\nRolling Stone reported: \u201cMore precisely, Hasbro purchased Entertainment One, a multimedia company that owns the children\u2019s franchises Peppa Pig and PJ Masks (these are apparently popular among the youth, though they surely pale in comparison with Mr. Potato Head). Entertainment One also has a music division, which happens to be one of the biggest independent labels in the industry \u2014 it took in more than $30 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2019. And back in 2013, eOne acquired the catalog of Death Row, which had previously been forced to declare bankruptcy in 2006.\u201d\n\nAlthough Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner didn\u2019t mention Death Row Records by name, he said in an interview with Deadline that the acquisition of Entertainment One would add \u201cbeloved story-led global family brands\u201d to the company\u2019s portfolio.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition of eOne adds beloved story-led global family brands that deliver strong operating returns to Hasbro\u2019s portfolio and provides a pipeline of new brand creation driven by family-oriented storytelling, which will now include Hasbro\u2019s IP. In addition, Hasbro will leverage eOne\u2019s immersive entertainment capabilities to bring our portfolio of brands that have appeal to gamers, fans and families to all screens globally and realize full franchise economics across our blueprint strategy for shareholders. We are excited to welcome eOne\u2019s talented employees from around the world into the Hasbro family.\u201d Hasbro to acquire Entertainment One adding brands and expanding storytelling through global entertainment.\n\nCNN reported that Hasbro\u2019s acquisition of Entertainment One, as well as Death Row Records, is expected to be finalized by the end of the year.
