The story is made up.\n\nThe story said that \"the three liberals were arrested as enemy combatants and brought to a military base due to the danger of mass destruction that may be called domestic terrorism.\"\n\nThe story lacked basic details such as where they were supposedly arrested. (Tthere was no mention of Miami or Florida in the article by Miami Post.).\n\nIf famous celebrities were nabbed for trying to take out Trump, it would be all over the news \u2014-- but it\u2019s only been all over the fake news world. Other fake news stories with the same phony allegations have circulated since 2017.\n\n\"This is a right wing news website that says me and Franco and Miley Cyrus got arrested. Luckily they let me tweet from prison. Haha.\"\n\nA headline said \"Breaking: 3 liberal celebrities arrested for conspiracy to assassinate President Trump.\" No such bust has occurred.
