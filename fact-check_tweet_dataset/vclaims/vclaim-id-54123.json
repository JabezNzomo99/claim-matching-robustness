No, that's not true. A claim that has gone viral asserts that a study proved a connection between kimchi and South Korea's relatively low COVID-19 death rate, but research behind the study wasn't done in South Korea -- it was done in Europe. And the study cited is only a \"preprint,\" meaning it has not been peer reviewed and therefore should not be used for data.\n\nThe story appeared as an article published by NextShark.com on July 20, 2020, titled \"Kimchi Helped Lower South Korea's COVID-19 Fatalities, Study Finds\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe glaring problem with this article on NextShark.com and also published on TheHealthyArchive.com and on Donga.com is the study that is referenced on Medrxiv -- an online archieve for unpublished manuscripts -- does not mention South Korea and research was only conducted for European countries.\n\nThis is the headline of the actual study, which clearly states \"Europe\":\n\nAssociation between consumption of fermented vegetables and COVID-19 mortality at a country level in Europe\n\nThe study was conducted by a team of researchers in France, led by Pulmonary Medicine at Montpellier University honorary professor Dr. Jean Bousquet.\n\nThe site warned that the study is a \"preprint,\" here is why that is a warning about the information in the study:\n\nWithin the study there are multiple statements that only Europe was considered in the report, not South Korea, and it warned that it should not be used to make assumptions about other countries in the world.\n\nThis is how the study opened says in its opening that the researchers' goal was, \"To test the potential role of fermented foods in COVID-19 mortality in Europe ... \" and the study plainly says results \"cannot be extrapolated to other regions.\"\n\nThe NextShark.com article claims that the study was published in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Allergy.\n\nThat journal hasn't published a single issue yet as of July 21, 2020. Here is an archived link to the page.\n\nThe Clinical and Translational Allergy journal does have an article published by one of the authors of the study, Jean Bousquet.\n\nThe article by Bousquet is titled \"Is diet partly responsible for differences in COVID-19 death rates between and within countries?\" and was published on May 27, 2020.\n\nThat article also only studied European countries and only briefly mentions Korea:\n\nUnderstanding the within and between country differences in COVID-19 will be of paramount importance in understanding COVID-19 risk and protective factors, and will eventually help to control the epidemics. We acknowledge that many factors may play a role in the extension and severity of COVID-19, such as trained immunity of the population, early and fast education, rapid organization and adaptation of the hospitals and the public, preparedness for pandemics and public hygiene. Diet represents only one of the possible causes of the COVID-19 epidemic and its importance needs to be better assessed.\n\nSouth Korea -- where kimchi is a dietary staple -- does have a low amount of deaths from COVID-19, with 296 deaths and 13,186 cases for a country with a population of approximately 50 million, according to Worldometers.com.\n\nHowever, this study does not publish data that shows kimchi is the reason for the country's low coronavirus death rate. In fact, the medRxiv website in their \"About\" section warns the news media not to use the studies for \"established information.\"", "lang": "en"}
