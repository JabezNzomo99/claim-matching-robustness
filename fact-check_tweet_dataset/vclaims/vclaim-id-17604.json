Kamala Harris, a Democratic candidate for president, has not called for Americans to \u201csurrender\u201d their guns, as social media posts wrongly assert.\n\nAt a CNN town hall in April, California Sen. Kamala Harris said that, if elected president, she\u2019d use executive powers to implement gun control policies \u2014 if Congress did not pass \u201creasonable gun safety laws\u201d within her first 100 days in office.\n\nThe Democratic candidate outlined her proposal, too, but she did not call for citizens to \u201csurrender your guns,\u201d as posts circulating on Facebook claim.\n\n\u201cIf elected & you don\u2019t surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door \u2013 Kamala Harris,\u201d the false posts read.\n\nWe could not find any evidence of Harris ever making that statement or advocating for such a move. The fabricated quote is also inconsistent with what she has said publicly.\n\nIn fact, Harris, during the town hall, lamented \u201csupposed leaders\u201d for failing \u201cto reject a false choice which suggests you\u2019re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone\u2019s guns away.\u201d\n\nHarris continued her criticism of lawmakers \u201cwho have failed to have the courage to recognize \u2026. we need reasonable gun safety laws in this country, starting with universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapons ban.\u201d\n\nShe then offered more specifics on her executive action plan, which align with the goals outlined on her campaign website.\n\n\u201cUpon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action.\u201d\n\nHarris spoke of requiring those who sell more than five guns annually to do background checks during those transactions, and requiring the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to revoke the licenses of gun dealers who break the law.\n\nLastly, she said she would prevent fugitives from being able to buy guns.\n\n\u201cPart of what has happened under the current administration is they took fugitives off the list of prohibited people,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d put them back on the list, meaning that fugitives from justice should not be able to purchase a handgun or any kind of weapon.\u201d\n\nWe should note that there\u2019s missing context from Harris\u2019 claim about fugitives \u2014 although some of it is included on her website.\n\nAs Harris noted on her website, the Trump administration in February 2017 \u201cnarrowed the definition of \u2018fugitive from justice\u2019 for purposes of determining when a person is prohibited from buying a gun.\u201d\n\nThe definition now says that the \u201cmere existence of an outstanding arrest warrant\u201d is not enough to deny the purchase. The Justice Department\u2019s new policy applies the \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d prohibitor only to individuals who fled their state to \u201cavoid prosecution for a crime or to avoid giving testimony in a criminal proceeding,\u201d and who are \u201csubject to a current or imminent criminal prosecution or testimonial obligation.\u201d\n\nHowever, disagreement between the FBI and the ATF over the term dates back years, according to a 2016 report by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, which advised the issue \u201cbe addressed as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nIn November 2017, the Washington Post reported that, before Trump took office, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel \u201csided with ATF and narrowed the definition of fugitives\u201d and said that gun purchases should only be denied to fugitives who crossed state lines. \u201cAfter Trump was inaugurated,\u201d the Post continued, \u201cthe Justice Department further narrowed the definition to those who have fled across state lines to avoid prosecution for a crime or to avoid giving testimony in a criminal proceeding.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.
