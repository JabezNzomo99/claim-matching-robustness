Ilhan Omar is not proposing a nationwide ban on \u201cunhealthy and immoral\u201d bacon. A self-described \u201csatire\u201d website published that made-up story, and it has since been shared by other websites that did not label the claim \u201csatire.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota \u2014 one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018 \u2014 has been a popular target for misinformation. We\u2019ve debunked several false claims about the congresswoman, mostly dealing with her religion.\n\nAnother false claim circulating online says Omar \u201chas proposed a nationwide ban on something \u2026 unheard of. Bacon.\u201d All of the bills she has sponsored and cosponsored can be found on congress.gov, and none of them would ban bacon.\n\nThe made-up story was originally published by DailyWorldUpdate.us, which says it is \u201ca subsidiary of the \u2018America\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u2019 network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d The website\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page also has this disclaimer: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site\u2019s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.\u201d\n\nHowever, the story has been copied by other sites that do not have any such disclaimer, and the Facebook pages that have shared the story don\u2019t either. Instead, those pages shared the story along with statements such as, \u201cNo thanks.\u201d And readers of those pages have responded with anti-Islamic comments such as: \u201cThrow her in a pig pen!\u201d and \u201cWould much rather have a nationwide ban on Muslims, particularly her!\u201d\n\nThe Quran states that it is \u201cforbidden\u201d to eat \u201cthe flesh of swine,\u201d which is considered \u201cimpure,\u201d as explained on the website IslamFaith.\n\n\u201cGod is protecting our health because the pig is an unclean animal. It is a scavenger that will eat almost anything it comes across,\u201d the website says. \u201cIt even eats its own waste, as well as maggots and decaying animals or vegetables, thus consuming many kinds of toxins.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
