It is completely unclear why Russia should bear any responsibility for this.\u201d\n\nIn the same RT report the head of the Center for Russian-American Relations at the Institute of the USA and Canada of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Pavel Podlesny, said that Russia was \u201cnot a participant in the conflict in the Donbas,\u201d but that it was only a \u201cguarantor of the Minsk agreements.\u201d\n\nThe statements of Dzhabarov and Podlesny both echo the official position of the Russian government, which has consistently insisted it is not a party to the conflict in the Donbas region of Ukraine and that it is a \u201ccivil war\u201d between the government in Kyiv and the self-proclaimed republics in the east of the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly denied military involvement in Ukraine.\n\nIn spite of Kremlin denials, however, the evidence of Moscow\u2019s involvement in the Donbas war is overwhelming and has been confirmed by numerous open-source investigations, journalistic investigations from international and Russian media outlets, and at times even Russian officials have let details of their military involvement slip.\n\nThe key military and political leaders in the self-proclaimed separatist \u201crepublics\u201d were Russian citizens, including the first \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d leader Alexander Borodai, \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic Minister of Defense\u201d Igor \u201cStrelkov\u201d Girkin, \u201cSparta\u201d Battalion leader Arseny \u201cMotorola\u201d Pavlov, Rusych Militia leader and neo-Nazi Alexei Milchakov.\n\nBoth foreign and Russian media have documented the presence of Russian \u201cvolunteers\u201d fighting for the self-proclaimed republics. Vice News has conducted series of investigations into Russian involvement in Ukraine.\n\nThe international intelligence investigation organization Inform Napalm has compiled numerous investigations of Russian military activity in the Donbas region, based largely on open source intelligence (OSINT). Bellingcat, another OSINT investigation group, has also published evidence of the Russian military presence in Ukraine. Such evidence often comes from the social media posts of Russian soldiers themselves.\n\nAnother telltale sign of Russian involvement is the presence of military technology neither produced by, nor purchased by the Ukrainian armed forces, such as the T-90A main battle tanks.\n\nTo date, the Russian side has failed to come up with a convincing explanation as to where the so-called \u201cseparatists\u201d obtained such a quantity of advanced military technology and the ammunition, fuel, and spare parts to operate them.\n\nRussian claims that the weapons were captured from Ukrainian army supply depots have been debunked as well.\n\nLastly, Russian leaders and other officials have at times let the facts about their military involvement in Ukraine slip out in public. Even President Vladimir Putin has on several occasions made reference to his military intervention in the country.\n\n\u201cWe never said there were not people there who carried out certain tasks including in the military sphere,\u201d Putin said at his annual press conference in December of 2015.\n\nSpeaking at a Moscow business forum in 2016, Putin said that Russia had been \u201cforced to defend the Russian speakers of the Donbas.\u201d\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, while not admitting the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine, said in an interview with Bloomberg in September, 2014 that there were \u201cmany Russians\u201d fighting in the Donbas.\n\nThe \u201cseparatist\u201d military leader and a Russian Army veteran, Igor \u201cStrelkov\u201d Girkin, also claimed responsibility for starting the war in Donbas.\n\nBased on the evidence available, the International Criminal Court in November of 2016 determined that the war in Ukraine was a Russian invasion and not, as Russia claimed, a civil war. In response, Russia withdrew from the ICC.\n\nAll of this sufficiently proves beyond reasonable doubt that Russia is militarily involved in Ukraine, and, contrary to the claims of RT\u2019s sources, a party to the armed conflict in the Donbas.", "lang": "en"}
