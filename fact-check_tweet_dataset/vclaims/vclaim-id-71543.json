The images are being used out of context; they have been taken from media reports about a woman seeking police assistance after being assaulted by a gang of men in 2016.\n\nThis post, which has been shared hundreds of times since it was published on Facebook on June 25, 2019, contains the two photos of the woman with a bloody face.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption states: \u201cThis is the slogan of Modi & Yogi Beti Bachao where policemen are mercilessly assaulting the daughters, what would you say to this? Modi - Yogi shame shame.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nNarendra Modi is India\u2019s prime minister, while Yogi is a reference to Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of northern Indian state Uttar Pradesh.\n\nBeti Bachao refers to \u201cBeti Bachao, Beti Padhao\u201d which means \u201csave the daughter, educate the daughter\u201d in Hindi and is a campaign launched by Modi in 2015. Here is an official campaign web page.\n\nThe same photos and caption were also shared elsewhere on Facebook, for example here.\n\nA Google reverse image search led to this footage of the same incident published by Indian news site The Quint on December 22, 2016.\n\nThe article is headlined: \"Couple Attacked in UP\u2019s Mainpuri for Resisting Lewd Remarks\". Mainpuri is a district in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAccording to the Quint report, the woman and her husband were beaten when they challenged a group of men for making lewd remarks.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the photos in the misleading Facebook post with key identifying features highlighted in red by AFP:\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the video in the Quint report, with the corresponding features highlighted:\n\nIn boxes A & B, the faces of the police officers correspond with the officers seen in the misleading post.\n\nBox C shows a yellow house in the background, and box D highlights the bleeding woman in a green dress.\n\nAnother reverse image search on Google found the photos in the misleading post also appeared in this video uploaded on December 23, 2016 on the Youtube Channel of the New York Post with the caption: \u201cIndian woman brutally beaten by a mob of men after resisting a groping creep.\u201d\n\nThe first photo appears at 10 seconds in this video, while the second photo appears at 24 seconds.\n\nBelow are two screenshots taken at those timestamps in the New York Post video:\n\nThe same incident was reported here in India on December 22, 2016 by Indian news agency Asian News International\u2019s Uttar Pradesh bureau (ANI UP).\n\nThe report reads: \u201cUttar Pradesh police has arrested a man for brutally beating a woman in a marketplace for resisting molestation.\"\n\nA case has been registered at Kishani area police station in Mainpuri against the three miscreants.\u201d\n\nThe incident was also reported by various online media in India, for example here and here. Some Indian TV news channels reported the incident with a video story uploaded on their official YouTube channels, for example here and here.\n\nCurrent Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath assumed his role as the head of the north Indian state on March 19, 2017, according to this The Hindu report.", "lang": "en"}
