Based on online hits, it became one of our most popular fact-checks ever.\n\nSo we wondered about the Walmart claim.\n\nIn the days before and after Black Friday, leaders no less prominent than President Barack Obama and Pope Francis decried the extent of income disparity in the United States and around the world. Obama a \"defining challenge of our time.\" that while the earnings of a minority \"are growing exponentially, so, too, is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few.\"\n\nWalmart, of course, is a big target.\n\n, as of May 2013 the international retailer had $469 billion in sales and 2.2 million employees, including 1.3 million in the United States. The corporation has been criticized for low wages; and in December 2012, PolitiFact National a claim that more Walmart employees are on Medicaid and food stamps than other companies.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear up front: Although income and wealth are related, they\u2019re not the same.\n\nWealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth -- the value of a person\u2019s assets minus liabilities. So, things like savings and retirement accounts, minus what is owed on a home mortgage, credit cards, etc. That means a person with heavy debt can have little wealth, or negative wealth, even while earning a six-figure income.\n\nOne more point before we get to the wealth figures.\n\nWalmart was , who opened the first store in Arkansas in 1962. Walmart incorporated in 1969 and became a publicly traded company a year later. So, Wal-Mart is not family owned, but rather owned by its stockholders; on the other hand, according to Bloomberg and other , the Walton family members still have control of the company, of the shares.\n\nScot Ross, One Wisconsin Now's executive director, told us his evidence to back his group\u2019s claim is a by economist , research and policy director of the liberal Economics Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.\n\nBivens wrote that in 2010, the wealth of six Walton family heirs was $89.5 billion, 22 percent higher than in 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, the median wealth of American families in 2010 was $77,300, nearly 39 percent lower than three years earlier.\n\nAs for measuring one against the other, Bivens said the Walton family wealth in 2010 was as large as the wealth of the bottom 48.8 million families in the United States, or 41.5 percent of all American families.\n\nRounded up, 41.5 percent would be 42 percent, the figure One Wisconsin Now claims.\n\nBut let's keep shopping around a little.\n\nIt turns out that a statement nearly identical to the one made by One Wisconsin Now was uttered in July 2012 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nSanders said the Walton family owns \"more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America,\" a claim PolitiFact National .\n\nOur colleagues found that , a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, compared the Waltons\u2019 cumulative net worth with that of the overall population, as cited in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances. That survey was published in August 2012.\n\nthat the Waltons\u2019 wealth in 2010 was valued at $89.5 billion -- equal to the entire bottom 41.5 percent of American families.\n\nThe 2010 figures are the latest available for doing comparisons with the net worth of the overall population.\n\nBut we found, using the Forbes 400 , that the wealth of six of Sam Walton\u2019s descendants has continued to grow. Here are their rankings and their wealth:\n\nAllegretto told us the housing crisis is a key reason that the gap between the Walton family wealth and the wealth of other American families has grown. More Americans were left with \"negative wealth\" because they lost their biggest asset -- their home -- and often significant amounts of their savings, as well, she said.\n\nOne Wisconsin Now wrote: \"The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined.\"\n\nFor comparison purposes, the latest data available, for 2010, the figure is 41.5 percent.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's website.", "lang": "en"}
