The claim is false; the video has been doctored from a news report by the Australian television channel ABC to include references to bananas; the scientist cited in the report told AFP the claim is untrue.\n\nThe 58-second video was published in this Facebook post on March 15, 2020.\n\nThe first three seconds of the video show the beginning of a news report, bearing the logo of Australia's public broadcaster ABC News. The news presenter Kathryn Robinson can be heard saying: \"Scientists from the University of Queensland are confident they'll be able to develop a vaccine for the deadly coronavirus.\"\n\nThe video then switches to a collage of visualisations of bananas and viruses. The text overlay from the video's 38-second mark states: \"Research made by scientists from the University of Queensland in Australia have proven that bananas, improve your inmune [sic] system due to the super source of Vitamins B-6 and helps prevent coronavirus. Having a banana a day keeps the coronavirus AWAY\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post's Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"According to University of Queensland Scientists - Banana, effective defence against COVID-19.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has has killed at least 7,900 people and infected some 190,000 others, as stated in this AFP report on March 18, 2020.\n\nThe video was also shared here on Facebook; here on YouTube and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe Philippine presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo also made a similar claim about the supposed anti-COVID-19 properties of bananas in this March 16, 2020 press briefing. In a mix of Tagalog and English, he said: \"I have read many things on how to destroy or contain, to kill the virus\u2026 I saw on the internet that bananas are a good defense\".\n\nALSO READ: Death Toll Chart Comparing Other Epidemics With COVID-19 Is Misleading\n\nA combined keyword and reverse image search using keyframes extracted from the video in the misleading posts found this longer video on the YouTube channel for ABC News on January 23, 2020.\n\nIt is titled: \"Race is on as Australian researchers rush to make coronavirus vaccine\".\n\nThe first three seconds of the misleading video correspond with the first three seconds of the ABC News video.\n\nALSO READ: False: The COVID-19 Fits Pattern Of Viral Outbreak Every 100 Years\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video (L) and the ABC News video (R):\n\nBut the full three-minute 39-second ABC News video does not mention bananas.\n\nALSO READ: Was The Ivaylovgrad Dam Flooded By Bulgaria To Keep Migrants Away?\n\nIt instead includes an interview with a University of Queensland scientist Dr. Keith Chappell, who discusses the university's efforts to develop a vaccine against the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn response to the claims made in the misleading Facebook post, Chappell told AFP via email on March 16, 2020: \"This is definitely NOT true.\"\n\nFollow BOOM's live blog on latest updates around the COVID-19 viral epidemic here.", "lang": "en"}
