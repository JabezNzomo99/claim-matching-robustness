Scripps, asked President Trump a question The Fact Checker has been dying to ask: Why does he keep saying that the United States is the world\u2019s highest-taxed nation when that is objectively false?\n\nWe have written a lot about this claim, ever since Trump started saying it during the 2016 presidential campaign. In our database of false and misleading claims by the president, he has made this particular claim 14 times between Jan. 20 and Oct. 8, but he has added to the tally since then. (We are struggling to keep up!)\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that the United States is the world\u2019s \u201cmost taxed nation\u201d was so obviously wrong that we never wrote a full-fledged fact check of the claim. Instead, we dealt with it as part of debate roundups, speech roundups and the like.\n\nIn his answer to Sacks, Trump suggested that he simply was using shorthand, that maybe it would be more precise to say the United States is the most taxed nation among developed countries. But he suggested that it did not really matter. \u201cA lot of people know exactly what I am talking about, and in many cases they think I am right when I say the highest,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: Every time we have fact-checked this statement, we have compared the United States to its peers in the developed world. The most accepted proxy for developed nations is the 35 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). And, no matter how you slice it, the United States never ends up on top.\n\nThe Pew Research Center, using 2014 data, looked at average taxes and social insurance contributions as a percentage of gross income for different family types. This chart of the findings had a total of 39 countries, including some non-OECD members. The United States almost always ranked near the bottom.\n\nThe nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, also using 2014 data, looked at government revenue as a share of the economy. Again, the United States ranks near the bottom of the list \u2014 far below the OECD average.\n\nFinally, CNBC used OECD data to make a chart that examined the amount of taxes paid per person in each country. In this scenario, the United States was slightly above average \u2014 but still in 13th place.\n\nAs we have noted before, the United States has the highest statutory corporate rate among OECD countries, 35 percent, but the effective rate \u2014 after deductions and the like \u2014 is 18.6 percent. The OECD does not report effective rates, but the Congresssional Budget Office says that is the fourth-highest rate among the Group of 20 countries, another set of U.S. economic peers.\n\nThe president\u2019s slight modification of his claim simply further demonstrates how seriously mistaken he continues to be on this issue. Among its economic peers, the United States is not at all the highest-taxed nation, no matter how you crunch the numbers. Trump may have convinced himself that he\u2019s right, but he continues to be very, very wrong.", "lang": "en"}
