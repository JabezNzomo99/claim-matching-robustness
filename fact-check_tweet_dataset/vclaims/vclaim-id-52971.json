Some miscreants are picking up a few videos from different parts of the world and using them to defame the Indian Army.\n\nOne such video is in circulation over the social media, showing some soldiers lying with their faces down on the ground. These soldiers are tied and are being pulled by other soldiers using ropes. This video has been shared on a YouTube channel named 'Waqas Malik 'Vicky' with the title Chinese Army punishing Indian Army. The person in the video is seen indicating that Chinese Army is punishing Indian Army soldiers after Galwan face-off.\n\nThis video was shared on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBut the soldiers pulling the ropes do not look like Chinese soldiers\n\nThe claim that the viral video shows Chinese soldiers punishing Indian Soldiers is FALSE.\n\nWhen the keyframes from the video are extracted and reverse image search is performed, we found longer versions of the viral video with the TikTok logo, with an ID of ahmed_shabir.\n\nHere is the video shared by ahmed_shabir on TikTok on April 21, 2020. In this video, we can see soldiers smiling and talking to each other before the exercise.\n\nOn further search, we found another longer video on YouTube channel named Mixer World, titled 'Bangladesh Army hard training.\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6 \u0986\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae\u09bf \u099f\u09cd\u09b0\u09c7\u09a8\u09bf\u0982 \u0995\u09a4\u099f\u09be \u09ad\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09a8\u0995,\u0995\u09a4\u099f\u09be \u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8\u09c7\u09b0 \u099d\u09c1\u0981\u0995\u09bf \u09a8\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u099f\u09cd\u09b0\u09c7\u09a8\u09bf\u0982 \u0995\u09b0\u09a4\u09c7'. The soldiers in this video are seen smiling and conversing in Bengali. This video has been uploaded on October 3, 2019, long before the India-China face-off.\n\nThe video has a description saying 'Bangladesh Army Training. See what terrible training the Bangladesh Army has to offer. Bangladesh Army's terrific training. See how horrible, difficult situation the Bangladesh Army has to accept. They are sacrificing their lives for the people of Bengal. I upload the videos to show the people of Bengal that they have dedicated their lives for us, that is, Bangladesh. This is not to upload videos to scare anyone or to stop them from serving in the Army, our devotion to them grew even more after seeing them.\n\nIndia Today has also debunked this claim.\n\nTherefore, the viral video does not show the Chinese Army punishing Indian Army soldiers. It is taken from Bangladeshi video where soldiers are being trained in the camp.\n\nHence, the above video is making a FALSE claim.", "lang": "en"}
