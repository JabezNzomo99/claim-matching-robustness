Richard Lugar, a Republican known for being willing to work with Democrats. Mourdock, the former Indiana state treasurer, ran on a message demonizing bipartisanship. He beat Lugar by 20 points.\n\n \n\n Many political analysts think Democrats have a better chance of winning the seat now that the race pits a tea party conservative against Donnelly, a moderate who favors gun rights and abortion restrictions.\n\n \n\n When he ran for re-election in 2010, Donnelly touted his credentials as an independent who opposed Pelosi on immigration and climate legislation.\n\n \n\n But did he vote for her?\n\n \n\n The Club for Growth cited House records of Donnelly\u2019s votes in 2007 and 2009. They leave no doubt: Donnelly voted for Pelosi to be speaker of the House.\n\n \n\n In 2011, however, he pulled his support and voted for Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina.\n\n \n\n In voting for Shuler, Donnelly said, \"This afternoon, I cast my vote for Representative Heath Shuler of North Carolina for speaker of the House in the 112th Congress. I supported my friend Congressman Shuler over former Speaker Nancy Pelosi during our party's leadership elections in November citing a need for new leadership. This need remains the same. What the voters told us in the 2010 election was that they wanted a change. And I believe a moderate approach with a dedication to working across the aisle, something I know is important to both me and Congressman Shuler, is the best way forward.\"\n\n \n\n Republicans won a majority in the House in 2010 and elected John Boehner of Ohio to the speaker\u2019s post. Pelosi still won a majority of her colleagues\u2019 support (Shuler received only 11 votes) and was elected House minority leader.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n It\u2019s true that in the most recent House election, he voted for someone else. But in the two previous votes -- the ones in which Democrats held a majority and had the power to choose the speaker -- Donnelly supported for Pelosi.\n\n \n\n His statement ignored those two votes. We rate his claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
