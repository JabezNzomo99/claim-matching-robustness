No, that's not true: the story was made up by a liberal satire website that routinely publishes death hoaxes about conservative figures. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on Conservative Tears on December 30, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: Border Wall GoFundMe Founder Dead Under Suspicious Circumstances\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIt truly is a sad day for Americans. Bri Kolfag, the founder of the famous border wall GoFundMe, gave everything when he lost two arms and a leg in Iraq. During deployment, he ran into a hail of gunfire to personally pull six of his team to safety. His heroics earned him a purple heart and a place in our hearts.

Kolfage's GoFundMe has collected $18 million at the time of writing, not $57 million as the story says.\n\nThe main purpose of the story seems to have been to bring attention to an old story involving Kolfage and a pensioner named Jan Vrotsos since the URL of the death hoax ended in \"Google Jan Vrotsos\" (https://conservativetears.com/2018/12/30/google-jan-vrotsos/) and the story contained two links to articles about it:\n\nGoogling \"Jan Vrotsos\" turned up some more links:\n\nThat last link notes that John Prager, one of the people in the network behind the hoax site, was once involved in a lawsuit with Brian Kolfage.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes conservativetears.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
