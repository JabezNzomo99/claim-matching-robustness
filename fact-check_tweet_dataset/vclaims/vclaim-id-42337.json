The Hindi text accompanying the post reads as, \u201cCRPF \u0915\u093e \u091c\u094b 153 bn ka \u091c\u0935\u093e\u0928 saheed\u0939\u0941\u0906 \u0939\u0948 \u0909\u0938\u0915\u0940 \u092c\u0940\u092c\u0940 \u0928\u0947 \u0916\u0941\u0926 \u0916\u093c\u0941\u0936\u0940 karli \u092d\u093e\u0908 \u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u0917\u0932\u0924 \u0915\u0930\u093e.\u201d\n\nEnglish translation \u2013 The jawan of CRPF\u2019s 153 battalion, who lost his life \u2013 his wife has committed suicide. It was (an) extremely wrong (step). A convoy carrying CRPF jawans was attacked by a suicide bomber, killing 40 soldiers on February 14.\n\nBOOM has decided not to feature the post on account of it being too graphic.\n\nBOOM spoke to M Dinakaran, CRPF DIG (Intelligence) of CRPF headquarters, who denied having received such news about the kin of the slain CRPF jawans. \u201cWe have not received any information about any widow of any martyred CRPF jawan committing suicide.\u201d According to Dinakaran, the 153 battalion, which is deployed in Bihar, had not received any information of a jawan from the regiment losing his life at the recent Pulwama terror attacks.\n\nBOOM however, could not independently verify the photo. In fact, the official twitter handle of CRPF has appealed to the nation to stop the spread of fake posts, messages and photographs, which are doing the rounds on social media, after the Pulwama attacks.", "lang": "en"}
