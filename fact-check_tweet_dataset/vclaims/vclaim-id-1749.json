Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, spoke up Jan. 12, 2017 in a news release lauding herself as somebody who \"stands up for Wisconsin dairy farmers.\"\n\nBaldwin wants Congress to pass the Dairy PRIDE Act -- officially known (at least to a few) as the \"Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, milk, and cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act.\"\n\nAfter two years of falling milk prices, she and other federal lawmakers want the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to enforce consumer regulations defining \"milk.\"\n\nIs Baldwin right that imitation dairy products -- for instance, soy milk -- often differ nutritionally from dairy item? And is labeling them \"milk\" or \"cheese\" or \"yogurt\" against the law?\n\nTo back that up, Baldwin\u2019s office pointed us to nutritional labels, and to FDA regulations that plainly state: \"Milk is the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows.\"\n\nTo dairy officials, inclusion of the word \"milk\" on non-dairy products is a misappropriation of the popularity of cow\u2019s milk. But competitors say coconut milk and soy milk have long histories and aren\u2019t confused with dairy. What\u2019s more, they note, the FDA doesn\u2019t punish \"peanut butter\" for using the dairy term \"butter.\"\n\nBut the FDA in 2008 and 2012 did tell two makers of drinks labeled \"soy milk\" that under its regulations, such labeling was inappropriate because the products did not contain \"milk\" as defined by the agency.\n\n\"Soy drink\" or \"Soy beverage\" would be better, the agency said at the time.\n\nThat -- and regulatory language allowing the FDA to declare a product misbranded and try to block its sale -- help Baldwin\u2019s case. Federal regulations are part of the United States Code that is the law of the land.\n\nBut to the frustration of the dairy industry, the agency has not consistently enforced that line of reasoning, allowing use of \"soy milk\" and \"almond milk\" and many others.\n\nRebecca Cross, a San Francisco-based regulatory lawyer for food product companies, said the FDA may be viewing labels on a case-by-case basis and allowing use of dairy terms on plant-based products so long as the use is not misleading.\n\nNathan Beaver, a food and drug lawyer with Foley & Lardner in Washington, D.C., explained that foods such as soy milk that have no FDA-written \"standard of identity\" must choose a \"common or usual\" name for their products.\n\nCourts, though, have jurisdiction over disputes on the issue and therefore get final say on the meaning of the FDA rules.\n\nOn milk, courts so far have found that cow\u2019s milk competitors are not misbranded if their names don\u2019t confuse consumers, said Cross.\n\nDairy alternatives, Baldwin said, \"contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products.\"\n\nThis is a bit tricky to evaluate given that beverages labeled as some kind of \"milk\" now come from such diverse sources as soy, almonds, cashews, hemp, rice, oats, coconut and sunflowers.\n\nFor help, we turned to Vandana Sheth, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a leading organization of food and nutrition professionals.\n\nFor starters, Sheth noted that dairy products can be a good source of calcium, vitamin D, protein and other essential nutrients.\n\nSoy milk provides close to the same amount of protein as cow\u2019s milk. Rice milk typically provides minimal protein and is higher in carbohydrates. Almond milk is usually quite low in protein and also less calorically dense, she said.\n\nPlant protein tends to be of a lower quality than dairy proteins, though soy is close, said John Lucey, a food scientist who directs the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nOur own review of labels found that soy and almond beverages, like cow\u2019s milk, are all relatively low calorie, low carbohydrate, low sodium drinks. They are all heavy with calcium.\n\nBut they feature a different mix of vitamins and minerals, and fat content. Examples: soy milk has a lot of folate, while cow\u2019s milk typically has none; cow\u2019s milk contains some Vitamin C, but the soy, almond and hemp drinks we examined have none.\n\nAlmond and soy milks feature some iron and fiber -- nutrients typically not found in cow\u2019s milk.\n\n\"All the products profile differently,\" said Susan Levin, a registered dietitian and director of nutrition education for the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.\n\nBottom line: Baldwin\u2019s nutrition observation is on target, based on a comparison of milk products.\n\nBaldwin claimed that imitation dairy products made from plants often differ nutritionally from the real thing, and labeling them \"milk\" or \"cheese\" or \"yogurt\" is \"against the law.\"\n\nThe nutrition point is accurate, and the legal point is partially so.\n\nOverall we rate her claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
