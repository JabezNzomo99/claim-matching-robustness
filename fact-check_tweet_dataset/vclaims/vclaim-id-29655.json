We will update this report if she does.\n\nfor her evidence of the claim.\n\nin the production of goods and services, contributing to\n\nin a legitimate manner and receiving compensation for the activity.\n\nPeople who are willing and able to work \u2013 members of\n\n\u2013 but do not, or work fewer than 20 hours a week,\n\nPeople who work at least 20 hours but less than 40 hours a week, or work in an activity that underutilises their skills, time or educational qualifications, are\n\nThe bureau does not have data on\n\nIt does have\n\non employment in agriculture. In the third quarter of 2017, about\n\n77.55 million Nigerians were engaged in some form of economic activity. Of these,\n\nwere doing agricultural work, according to the 2017 third quarter\n\nclaims more than 12 million members in rice production, from farming to milling, marketing and research.\n\nits focus is to help meet Nigeria\u2019s demand for rice, which it estimates at 5 million tonnes a year.\n\nThe group\u2019s members have grown from 7 million before Buhari took office to 12.2 million \u201cor even more\u201d,\n\nHe attributed the growth to the success of the administration\u2019s agricultural policies. But he didn\u2019t\n\nsay how those numbers were arrived at, or if they were equivalent to jobs.\n\nThe claim was possible but difficult to check, Dr Wale Oni, an agricultural economist, told Africa Check. This is because rice production is largely informal and its jobs seasonal.\n\nIncentives such as the\n\n, which helps small farmers grow more rice, and concessional lending had been beneficial, Oni said.\n\n\u201cBut the claim is hard to verify. We must be provided with a methodology as to the figure was arrived at.\u201d\n\nDr Festus Awoyelu, an agricultural economist at the\n\n, also said the jobs claim was possible.\n\n\u201cTwelve million jobs so created could be full-time jobs and not seasonal as some believe. Rice production has many parts and [thus] enough all-year-round activities.\u201d\n\nBut independently verifying the number would require a state-by-state count of rice farmers and related jobs. Not all states keep this data, Awoyelu said.\n\nConclusion: Difficult to verify that Buhari has created 12 million jobs in rice production\n\nLauretta Onochie, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s social media adviser, said 12 million jobs had been created in Nigeria\u2019s important rice industry.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t give the source of her claim. The country\u2019s statistics office doesn\u2019t keep data on jobs in rice production.\n\nThe industry\u2019s largest grouping said its members had increased from 7 million before Buhari took office to 12.2 million in 2018.\n\nTwo agricultural economists said the jobs claim was possible, but the numbers difficult to verify because there wasn\u2019t enough data available.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim as unproven.", "lang": "en"}
