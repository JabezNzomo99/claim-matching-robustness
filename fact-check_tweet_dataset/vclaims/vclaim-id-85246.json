Trump pointed to the recent arrests as an example of doing what he promised, by getting the \u201cbad ones\u201d out of the country. Is he correct?\n\nArrests were reported in other cities, including Phoenix, where officials deported an undocumented woman who was ordered removed years ago. Although she had received her final order for deportation, she was allowed to stay in the country for several years as long as she checked in at set intervals with federal immigration officials.\n\nToward the end of former president Barack Obama\u2019s second term, the administration shifted its enforcement priorities so that the vast majority of the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants would not be subject to immediate removal. The Obama administration narrowed its priorities to people who were convicted criminals, terrorism threats or who had recently entered the country.\n\nOn Jan. 25, President Trump signed an executive order expanding the priorities. The order included as priority undocumented people who were charged (but not convicted) of criminal offenses, have \u201ccommitted acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense,\u201d and have \u201cabused any program related to receipt of public benefits.\u201d People who were ordered for removal long ago but did not leave the country \u2014 like the Phoenix woman \u2014 are a priority under this order.\n\nThe other 25 percent included people who would not have been targeted in fugitive operations under Obama. It includes people who immigration advocates call \u201ccollateral\u201d arrests \u2014 individuals with noncriminal convictions or years-old immigration violations and happened to be present when ICE agents arrived to arrest criminal aliens. According to anecdotes of recent arrests, undocumented people with traffic violations were subject to arrest.\n\n\u201cWe had an environment in the last two years of the Obama administration where people who didn\u2019t have a serious criminal violation were not at a very high risk of deportation or almost no risk at all, because ICE was not prioritizing them,\u201d said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the nonpartisan think tank Migration Policy Institute. \u201cIt was a very rare event where someone who didn\u2019t have a felony or serious misdemeanor, or wasn\u2019t a recent arrival, was arrested. Now, it\u2019s not as rare.\u201d\n\nTo put the 680 arrests in perspective: If the Trump administration continued arresting 680 people every week, that means 35,360 people would be arrested in fugitive operations in a year. That would bring the fugitive operation arrests back to the levels they were under the earlier years of Obama\u2019s administration, before the priorities were narrowed. In fiscal 2010, there were 35,774 arrests in fugitive operations and 39,466 such arrests in fiscal 2011.\n\nBut ICE has always targeted dangerous criminals in enforcement priorities. The recent arrests, however, did include people who would not have fallen under Obama\u2019s narrower enforcement priorities. But such people \u2014 which DHS has categorized as 25 percent of the arrests \u2014 had lesser charges and noncriminal convictions, and are not the \u201cvery, very hardened criminals\u201d that Trump describes.", "lang": "en"}
