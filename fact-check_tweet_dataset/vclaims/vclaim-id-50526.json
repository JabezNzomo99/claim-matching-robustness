The ban doesn\u2019t cover all of Europe and has numerous exemptions.\n\nThe ban applies to countries in the \"Schengen Area\" \u2014 a designation for a group of European states part to an agreement allowing free movement among their nations without border checks. Most nations in the European Union are part of the Schengen Area.\n\nCountries covered in the ban include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nTrump\u2019s proclamation had more details. It said the ban was for people seeking entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants and who were \"physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States.\"\n\nThe immigrant category applies to people who intend to live permanently in the United States; the nonimmigrant category includes people who want to come temporarily, such as tourists.\n\nStill, the proclamation listed categories of people who could come in despite the ban. For instance, the ban does not apply to people who, based on the discretion of top U.S. health officials, \"would not pose a significant risk of introducing, transmitting, or spreading the virus.\"\n\nForeign government officials and their immediate family members and people seeking entry as employees of a designated international organization or NATO are also among those exempt from the ban.\n\nAs Trump said in his address, the United Kingdom \u2014 comprised of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 is also exempt from the ban. He didn\u2019t mention the Republic of Ireland in his speech, but as a non-Schengen country Ireland is exempt as well.\n\nWhether the ban lasts 30 days is uncertain. The proclamation says the ban will remain in effect until Trump decides otherwise. The Health and Human Services secretary is expected to make recommendations to the president going forward.\n\nFor clarity, the proclamation said the ban would go into effect at \"11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on March 13.\"\n\n\"There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings.\"\n\nThis falsely made it sound as if some Americans would not be allowed back into the country. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and their spouses are not banned from coming to the United States.\n\nOthers allowed in include: non-U.S. citizen parents of unmarried U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents under 21 years old; siblings of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents if both are unmarried and under the age of 21; children, foster children or wards of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, or a prospective adoptee seeking entry under certain visas; and members of the U.S. Armed Forces, their spouses and children.\n\nPeople exempt from the ban will be directed to a limited number of airports where they can be screened.\n\n\"These prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.\"\n\nThis is directly contradicted by the proclamation, a White House fact-sheet, and a tweet from Trump after his address. Goods and cargo can still come in from Europe.\n\nThe proclamation said that \"the free flow of commerce between the United States and the Schengen Area countries remains an economic priority\" and that Trump remained \"committed to facilitating trade between our nations.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Trump tweeted: \"The restriction stops people not goods.\"", "lang": "en"}
