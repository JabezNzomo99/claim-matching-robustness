In 1972, she visited Hanoi, where she made several radio broadcasts imploring U.S. pilots to stop bombing North Vietnam, according to the Washington Post. A well-known photo from that controversial visit shows her sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun.\n\nThe Facebook post, which contains a number of claims about Fonda that have since been debunked by other fact-checkers, attributes to Walters a statement critical of the actress. It has been shared more than 14,000 times. (RELATED: Was Jane Fonda Denied Service At A Restaurant Run By A Vietnam Veteran?)\n\n\u201cBarbara Walters writes: Unfortunately, many have forgotten and still countless others have never known how Ms. Fonda betrayed not only the idea of our country, but specific men who served and sacrificed during the Vietnam War,\u201d reads the beginning of the post.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence Walters ever said or wrote the statement attributed to her in the Facebook post. A Nexis search didn\u2019t turn up any matching or similar statements. No instances turned up on Newspapers.com.\n\nWalters did sit down with Fonda in 1988, but the statement doesn\u2019t appear in that interview either. In fact, Fonda actually apologized for her visit to North Vietnam and for posing for the photograph of her sitting on an anti-aircraft gun during the interview, according to an ABC News transcript.\n\n\u201cJane Fonda told me that she now realizes in her urgent desire to end the war, she unthinkingly caused pain to many Americans who fought in Vietnam,\u201d said Walters. \u201cIn our interview tonight, she speaks directly to former prisoners of war, to Vietnam veterans and their families. And confronting her past, she then apologizes.\u201d\n\nFonda also appeared in an ABC News special, entitled \u201cA Celebration: 100 Years of Great Women,\u201d that aired in April 1999. Walters, who hosted the program, also doesn\u2019t appear to have made the statement during that broadcast.\n\nThe statement has been circulating in various forms for roughly two decades, according to Snopes.", "lang": "en"}
