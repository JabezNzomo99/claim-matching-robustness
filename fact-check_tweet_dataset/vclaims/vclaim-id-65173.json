There is no evidence the fire was deliberately set or intended to target Chinese-owned businesses, according to local news reporting.\n\nThe footage shows a building engulfed in flames and people running from it, while a woman in a nearby building shouts for them to \u201cget out.\u201d The caption claims it depicts \u201cNigerians burning down Chinese businesses in retaliation for attacks on Africans in China.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook caption\u2019s claim is inaccurate, however. Local media outlets that picked up the video reported the fire occurred at the Dugbe Market in Ibadan, Nigeria, on April 15. Witnesses said it started accidentally and \u201cemanated from an electrical spark that started from welding equipment,\u201d according to The Guardian Nigeria.\n\nWhile multiple shops, residential buildings and vehicles sustained damage from the blaze, there was no mention of any Chinese-owned businesses being affected or targeted.\n\nThe post appears to reference recent reports that African citizens have faced discrimination under coronavirus mitigation efforts in the Chinese city of Guangzhou. African citizens have reported being evicted from their apartments, being tested for coronavirus multiple times without receiving results and being discriminated against in public, according to Reuters.\n\nChina has denied such allegations from U.S. and African officials, according to NBC News.
