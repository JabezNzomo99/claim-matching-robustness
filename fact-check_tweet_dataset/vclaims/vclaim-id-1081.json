The claim is false, according to Google. The company said a technical fault caused the image to be lost during an update in late April, and the fault has now been rectified.\n\nViral examples of the claim on Facebook and Twitter can be found here and here .\n\nOne post from June 14 reads, \u201cWhy has US tech giant Google deleted the photo of Winston Churchill from their list of British PMs? It\u2019s clear there\u2019s a coordinated campaign to undermine one of our great national heroes - what on earth is going on?\u201d\n\nDebate over former Prime Minister Churchill\u2019s legacy has grown after a number of imperialist monuments were taken down or defaced during anti-racism protests in the UK. The statue of Churchill in Parliament Square, London, was sprayed with graffiti on June 7 and later boarded up as protests continued (here , here) .\n\nThe anti-racism protests held in recent weeks were triggered by the death of African American George Floyd, on 26th May. A post on Twitter from 14th May (here) shows that Winston Churchill\u2019s photo was missing from Google\u2019s list of British prime ministers before Floyd\u2019s death and the wave of protests that followed.\n\nGoogle posted a detailed explanation on Twitter as to why the photo was missing (here). At the end of April Google said it received feedback that the image of Churchill automatically selected by its systems was not representative as it showed a young Churchill. It said it blocked the unrepresentative image in order that its systems may automatically select a new one, however a bug prevented the update from happening. This meant that Churchill\u2019s entry did not have an image from late April until 14th June when the issue was brought to Google\u2019s attention and resolved.\n\nGoogle said that the lack of image was not deliberate. The company\u2019s Twitter statement from June 14 reads: \u201cWe\u2019ve now resolved the issue that was preventing the picture of Sir Winston Churchill from being updated to appear in his knowledge panel and Knowledge Graph-related lists. Again, this was not purposeful. Our apologies for the concerns caused.\u201d\n\nReuters confirmed that a picture of Churchill is now visible on Google\u2019s list of British prime ministers (here) .\n\nPartly false. Winston Churchill\u2019s picture was lost from a Google list of British prime ministers, however Google says it was not a deliberate omission but rather a technical issue that occurred in late April and has since been rectified.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
