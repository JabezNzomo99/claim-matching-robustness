It is being claimed that they (Muslims) are the reason for the denial of permission to Patanjali\u2019s \u2018Coronil\u2019 medicine by the AYUSH Ministry. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The names of Muslims in the AYUSH Ministry\u2019s Scientific Panel who were responsible for the denial of permission to Patanjali\u2019s \u2018Coronil\u2019. Fact: The names given in the post are taken from the Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM) website which deals with the Unani Medicine whereas the Patanjali\u2019s \u2018Coronil\u2019 is reportedly an Ayurvedic medicine. Also, the Press Information Bureau has clarified that there is no such scientific panel in the Ministry. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the image posted, it can be seen that the names were taken from the \u2018Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM)\u2019 website. The names were taken from the \u2018Scientific Personnel\u2019 list on the CCRUM website. CCRUM is a research council under the AYUSH Ministry which deals with the Unani Medicine (\u2018Unani Medicine is a form of traditional medicine practiced in Middle- East and South-Asian countries. It was introduced in India by the Arabs and Persians sometime during the eighth century\u2019). But Patanjali\u2019s \u2018Coronil\u2019 is reportedly an Ayurvedic medicine. There is a separate research council for Ayurvedic Medicine \u2013 \u2018Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS)\u2019, under the AYUSH Ministry.\n\nAlso, the Press Information Bureau has clarified that there is no such scientific panel in the Ministry.\n\nIn his recent tweets, Acharya Balkrishna (M.D. of Patanjali Ayurved Ltd) has said that the controversy has been resolved and they have submitted the necessary documents to the Ministry. The tweets can be seen here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, people from Unani\u2019s scientific personnel list targeted for AYUSH-Patanjali \u2018Coronil\u2019 issue.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
