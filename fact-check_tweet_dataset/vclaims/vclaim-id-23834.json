While security forces have widely been blamed for the killings, the investigation into those events has not been concluded.\n\nPutin told Stone that Georgian snipers had been present on Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the central square in Kyiv, \u201ccompletely ruling out\u201d the possibility that ousted former president Viktor Yanukovych could have used force against the civilian population.\n\nStone himself had previously repeated this claim on social media.\n\nHowever, Polygraph.info already debunked this claim, initially made by an Italian journalist who blamed the Euromaidan killings on Georgian mercenaries operating under the direction of former Georgian Prime Minister Mikhail Saakashvili.\n\nThat account was full of holes, from clearly forged Georgian security service documents to video footage uncovered by BBC Monitoring allegedly proving the men were in Kyiv in 2014, but video which was later found to have been shot in December 2016.\n\nPutin himself presented no new evidence to back up this previously discredited claim.\n\nIn his interview with Stone, Putin also categorically rejected claims that Russia interfered in the 2016 United States presidential election:\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t interfere then, and I don\u2019t want to interfere now, and I don\u2019t intend to do it in the future,\u201d Putin said.\n\nHe added that while \u201cRussian bloggers\u201d might have expressed themselves online, it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to believe they played a critical role in the outcome.\n\nHowever, as Polygraph.info previously reported, a district court in Washington DC indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team of hacking the Democratic Party\u2019s computers, stealing their data and publishing that information to influence the 2016 election.\n\nIn addition, three entities and 13 Russian individuals, including \u201cPutin\u2019s Chef,\u201d Yevgeny Prigozhin, and his Internet Research Agency (IRA), a so-called \u201ctroll factory,\u201d were indicted for interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign in order to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system,\u201d support the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald Trump and disparage then-candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Computational Propaganda Project, launched by the European Research Council, a research body established by the European Commission, found that the IRA had \u201claunched an extended attack on the United States by using computational propaganda to misinform and polarize US voters.\u201d\n\nThe project concluded that during 2015-17, \u201cover 30 million users shared the IRA\u2019s Facebook and Instagram posts with their friends and family, liking, reacting to, and commenting on them along the way.\u201d\n\nOn November 25, 2018, Russian Coast Guard boats attempted to stop a Ukrainian tugboat as it was on its way to transit the Kerch Strait from the Black Sea into the Azov Sea, between Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nIn his interview with Oliver Stone, Putin alleged that the incident was \u201ca provocation\u201d organized by then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in a bid to introduce \u201cspecial conditions\u201d and postpone elections in Ukraine.\n\nThis conspiracy theory, cited repeatedly in the run-up to the March 31, 2019 Ukrainian presidential election, proved to be false.\n\nThe Ukrainian election went ahead as scheduled, although conspiracy theories about a Poroshenko power grab continued.\n\nTwo days before the election, Russian state TV presenter Dmitry Kiselyov claimed Poroshenko would use \u201cdirty election techniques\u201d to falsify the results.\n\nA day after the election, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin accused Poroshenko of illegally trying to influence the outcome of the election.\n\nVariations of that message were widely broadcast across numerous Russian state media platforms.\n\nLong after Poroshenko conceded defeat to current president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, reports continued to circulate claiming Poroshenko was manufacturing a way to stay in power.\n\nBut Zelenskiy was sworn in as Ukraine\u2019s sixth president without incident on May 20, 2019, discrediting that allegation, which Putin nonetheless chose to repeat.\n\nPutin spoke with Stone about former U.S. President Barack Obama, accusing him of not keeping his word on unspecified agreements made regarding Ukraine during a telephone conversation.\n\n\"You know, Obama is no longer the president, but, nevertheless, there are certain things that we don\u2019t speak about publicly. In any case, I can say that our agreements, which were reached in this telephone conversation, were not fulfilled by the American side,\u201d Putin said, adding that he would not give further details.\n\nWhile Putin has previously accused the United States of duplicity in regards to the ouster of Yanukovich, without further elaboration, the veracity of Putin\u2019s most recent comments remain unclear.", "lang": "en"}
