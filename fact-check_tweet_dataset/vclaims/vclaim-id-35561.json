ANI reported that Union Minister Jitendra Singh released a book on Article 370 written by a 14-year-old girl, Ayanna Kohli. Providing the purported synopsis of the book, ANI wrote that it \u201cseeks to draw the inference that it was necessary to revoke Article 370 in order to bring lasting peace in Kashmir.\u201d\n\nThe news agency quoted the girl in its report as saying, \u201cIn the last two month, I have travelled across the country, I can say the decision to abrogate Article 370 has been celebrated by each Indian.\u201d The same quote was also ascribed to the girl in a tweet by ANI.\n\nPTI also reported that 14-year-old Ayanna \u201cwrote a book on Article 370.\u201d PTI further quoted Singh talking about the book in reference to Article 370 \u2013 \u201cthe book is a vindication of the gross mental agony and injustice suffered by the children of her age group on account of the now abolished clause of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIs the book on Article 370?\n\nWhile the book is named \u2018In the Times of Article 370\u2019, it does not talk about the removal of J&K\u2019s statehood and special status. The foreword of the book, penned by journalist Barkha Dutt, mentions that the book is written by Ayanna and her father. The 14-year-old\u2019s father, Umang Kohli, is a serving officer in the Indian army. Dutt writes, \u201cThat it is written by a father and his daughter to bring to life what a young soldier on duty may experience on counter-terrorism duty in situations that are unpredictable, but sometimes also moving and uplifting.\u201d\n\nThe book is a work of fiction \u2013 a story about protagonist Ram, who is an army man.\n\nSpeaking to Alt News, Umang Kohli reiterates that the book has no mention of Article 370 except in the preface. He also tells us that Ayanna has narrated his story in the book. \u201cShe is a 14-year-old who has written about soldiers\u2019 life in Kashmir. How would she know of all this if not me? She has heard stories from me and my life as an officer. I\u2019m her inspiration behind the book. I have guided her but she has written the book by adding her own imagination. It is a work of fiction.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he has co-authored the book, Kohli said, \u201cThe story is inspired by me and my life experiences but the book is written by my daughter which is why the author note mentions her name. My involvement in the book has been duly acknowledged. Now whether someone wants to term it is as \u2018co-author\u2019 is up to them.\u201d\n\nUnion Minister Jitendra Singh and news agencies ANI and PTI, therefore, falsely claimed that the book is about Article 370. Moreover, none of them mentioned that the book is a work of fiction.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in the article, ANI wrote that Ayanna travelled for two months across the country and found that Article 370 has been celebrated by each Indian. Umang Kohli wrote in response to ANI\u2019s tweet that this statement was not made by his daughter but BJP MP Singh.\n\nANI later tweeted a video of the Union Minister where he can be heard making the same statement.\n\nThe update (sans clarification) is yet to be provided in ANI\u2019s article and YouTube video.\n\nANI misquoted the 14-year-old girl, claiming that she travelled for two months across the country, collecting people\u2019s testimonies on Article 370. The news agency, along with PTI and Union Minister Jitendra Singh, also gave a misleading representation of the book. \u2018In the Times of Article 370\u2019 might give the impression that it talks about the dilution of Article 370, however, it a fictional book on the life of a soldier.", "lang": "en"}
