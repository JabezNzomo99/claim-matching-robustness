Spending on these will fall by \u00a31.2 billion by the end of the current parliament once inflation is considered. That doesn\u2019t mean it will fall by that amount in every year of the parliament as Mr Smith appeared to suggest.\n\nThe government told us it was referring to spending on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA). Spending on these will rise slightly ahead of inflation over the Parliament.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t tell us about how spending on individuals has and will change.\n\nAll the figures referred to are in 2015/16 prices, unless otherwise stated.\n\nSpending on all disability and incapacity benefits\n\nSpending on all benefits connected to disability and incapacity for work was \u00a342.3 billion in 2010/11, adjusted for rising prices, compared to around \u00a3100 billion spent on welfare outside pensions.\n\nIt will be \u00a348.6 billion this year and \u00a347.4 billion by 2019/20. That\u2019s an average fall over the next five years of \u00a3295 million a year.\n\nThat\u2019s based on new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, combined with existing information from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\n\nIt would have been \u00a31 billion less by 2019/20 if the changes to Personal Independence Payment introduced in the budget had been made. They\u2019ve since been withdrawn.\n\nSpending on DLA, PIP and AA, counted in the government\u2019s calculations, is expected to go up slightly. It will increase from about \u00a321.7 billion in 2015/16 to \u00a321.8 billion in 2019/20.\n\nIt won\u2019t increase by as much as has been the case over recent years.\n\nIf the government had gone ahead with its plans to change PIP, total spending on PIP and DLA would have fallen in real terms.\n\nWhat this means for individuals\n\nLooking at overall spending doesn\u2019t tell us about how people with disabilities have been affected or how they will be affected.\n\nThe OBR\u2019s projections following the budget this year focus on DLA and PIP, which is what we\u2019re covering here.\n\nThe government said the replacement of the Disability Living Allowance with the Personal Independence Payment was designed mainly to support \u201cdisabled people who face the greatest challenges to living an independent life\u201d. It was expected to reduce the number of people claiming the benefit and to reduce expenditure from what it would otherwise have been.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t done that by as much as had been expected.\n\nMore existing DLA claimants have ended up claiming PIP than was predicted and more of those people have ended up being awarded the enhanced payments.\n\nBut forecasts for the next five years suggest the number of people claiming DLA or PIP will decrease.\n\nThe average spend per claimant will continue to rise, but it won\u2019t increase by as much as has been the case. Average spending per claimant will rise by 6%, compared to 12% between 2009/10 and 2014/15.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that the \u2018average\u2019 represents the typical person\u2019s experience, as it just takes overall spending and divides it by the total number of people expected to claim.", "lang": "en"}
