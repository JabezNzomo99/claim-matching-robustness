The claim is false; the video is a doctored version of an unrelated news report about the deaths of two other Filipino celebrities.\n\nThe 19-second video was published on YouTube here on October 24, 2019. It has been viewed more than 23,000 times.\n\nThe video\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \u201cActress Shaina Magdayao, Died at the Age of 30 Because of Hypothyroid Disease.\u201d\n\nIt shows what appears to be a clip from a news report. A newsreader can be seen standing next to a screen which purports to show the message: \u201cR.I.P. Shaina Magdayao 1989-2019\u201d.\n\nThe final portion of the video shows a graphic of Magdayao\u2019s photo and text that reads: \u201cREST IN PEACE SHAINA MAGDAYAO 1989-2019\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading YouTube post:\n\nThe video has been embedded in several online news articles, for example here and here, with a similar claim.\n\nWebsites which contain the video and those that redirect to it were also shared on Facebook here and on Twitter here.\n\nThe claim in the posts is false; the video is a doctored version of an unrelated news report about the deaths of Filipino celebrities Amalia Fuentes and Tony Mabesa.\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes using the verification tool InVID and subsequent keyword searches found the original video published here by Philippine television channel GMA News on October 5, 2019.\n\nThe video\u2019s Tagalog-language title translates to English as: \u201c24 Hours: Amalia Fuentes and Tony Mabesa, deceased.\u201d\n\nFuentes and Mabesa are icons of the Philippine entertainment industry whose careers in film and theatre spanned decades, according to this Philippine Daily Inquirer report.\n\nThe first five seconds of the misleading video corresponds with the first five seconds of the original video.\n\nThis same five-second clip was looped in the misleading video.\n\nIn the misleading video, the television screen next to the newsreader has also been doctored.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video (L) with the altered graphic box and the original GMA News report (R):\n\nIn the GMA News clip, the newsreader\u2019s comments in Tagalog translate to English as: \u201cThe entertainment industry is mourning the deaths of veteran actress Amalia Fuentes, and veteran actor, director and professor Tony Mabesa.\u201d\n\nMagdayao\u2019s management team told AFP by a text message on October 31, 2019, that she is alive and called reports of her death \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for her team told AFP: \u201cIt\u2019s fake news.
