Daniel Abraham , and \u201ccost hundreds of thousands of shekels, and its promotion cost hundreds of thousands of shekels more,\u201d the campaign said. (A shekel is worth about 25 cents.) The total cost of the activity of \u201cA Million Hands\u201d to replace Netanyahu was $6 million to $7 million, the campaign asserted, though an article it cited did not contain that figure.

A spokesman for OneVoice promised a response, but we have not received one\u2013despite repeated requests, even after the publication of this column.\n\u2022 None \u201cCommanders for the Security of Israel,\u201d a group of former generals, which the campaign said was funded to the tune of \u201chundreds of thousands of shekels.\u201d That\u2019s maybe $100,000 to $200,000.\n\u2022 None Ameinu, another group, sponsored a get-out-the-vote campaign in the Arab community.

Though he acknowledged that Arabs tend to support left-leaning candidates, he noted that a Druze candidate on the Likud list also benefited from the group\u2019s work.\n\u2022 None Activities of political strategist Eyal Arad, which the campaign said was funded primarily by American donors and , which the campaign said was funded primarily by American donors and cost \u201cseveral million dollars.\u201d Arad has denied that claim , shooting back back that in 1994 Netanyahu had offered him a job that would have been funded by a \u201cforeign and unnamed businessman.\u201d (Netanyahu\u2019s campaign denied it.)\n\nTo some extent, this is a debate over policy. Jews from around the world contribute to both left-wing and right-wing organizations in Israel in order to influence the country\u2019s political dialogue; Netanyahu just happens to be focused on the left-wing ones, many of which support a negotiated settlement with the Palestinians. Netanyahu\u2019s figures also are open to question, as they are based on estimates that have not been confirmed. And, as you have seen, many of his charges have been denied by the organizations in question.\n\nGerald Steinberg, president of the NGO Monitor, a right-leaning Israeli group that publicizes the funding of NGOs in Israel, said many of the groups mentioned by the campaign do not file reports with regulatory agencies, making it difficult to determine how much they may have spent in the election. \u201cA reasonable estimate is that these groups injected at least two to three million dollars into the anti-Netanyahu campaign,\u201d he said, referring to V15 and Million Hands.\n\nHe said he did not know how the Netanyahu campaign came up with a $6 million to $7 million estimate for Million Hands, or several million dollars for V15. \u201cI did a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on minimal likely costs, including banner ads on popular Web sites, etc., and assumed that they didn\u2019t pay much or anything (pizza and beer) for locals to knock on doors or put up banners,\u201d he said, referring to his estimate of $2 million to $3 million.\n\nBut Steinberg also noted that \u201cannual European government support for influential Israeli political NGOs such as the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, B\u2019Tselem, Peace Now, Gisha, Yesh Din, etc. exceeds $20 million annually,\u201d a figure documented in a report issued by NGO Monitor. \u201cThese groups and the officials that lead them were very active in the media campaigns opposing Netanyahu,\u201d he said, causing anger in right-wing circles. But others would argue these are human-rights groups, not political entities.\n\nFinally, there is the question of U.S. government involvement. Some U.S. lawmakers have accused the Obama administration of interfering in the election, citing a State Department grant totaling $233,500 to OneVoice. But State says the grant ended in November 2014, and was intended to promote a two-state solution. Yet after lawmakers raised questions, OneVoice registered a new funding entity under a part of the tax code that allows engagement in some political activity.\n\nEven under Netanyahu\u2019s count, it\u2019s difficult to get much past $10 million when examining groups confirmed to have engaged in election campaigning. Clearly, claiming \u201ctens of millions\u201d appears to be an exaggeration \u2014 one that he tried to take back in his NBC interview. He would be on more solid ground to claim \u201cmillions,\u201d but the actual number may not be known for a while, if ever.", "lang": "en"}
