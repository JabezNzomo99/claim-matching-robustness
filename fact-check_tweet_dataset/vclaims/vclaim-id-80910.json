What followed was a barrage of misinformation. From political leaders, news anchors to users on social media, fake claims and unverified news was circulated on various platforms. A year on, here's a look at some recurring misinformation that refuses to die down even today.\n\n1. Did Ambedkar Oppose Article 370? No Official Records Back it From Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu to Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati, leaders peddled the same narrative \u2013 BR Ambedkar was against the inclusion of Article 370. But a closer look at his views at the time don't align with what these leaders had claimed. Ambedkar's well-documented speeches, writings and parliamentary debates, which are available on the Ministry of External Affairs' website, make it evident that he sought a quick solution for the Kashmir issue and had, in fact, advocated a plebiscite. Ambedkar even said that partition was the right solution for Kashmir! And the closest we get to understanding Ambedkar\u2019s views on Article 370 is through what he had said during a debate on Representation of People\u2019s Bill in the Parliament in 1950. Referring to the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, Ambedkar said, \u201cParliament has no room to make any provision with regard to the representation of Kashmir.\u201d He had also mentioned that the J&K government is supreme. While none of the government documents hold any record of Ambedkar opposing Article 370, what is the genesis of this claim?

Another recurring claim pertains to the involvement of Sardar Patel in the Kashmir issue. Home Minister Amit Shah said that the issue of Kashmir should have been handled by Sardar Patel instead of former PM Jawaharlal Nehru, implying that Patel had no hand in the implementation of Article 370. But do his claims have any factual basis? What is the truth? Srinath Raghavan, a Professor of International Relations and History at Ashoka University in a 2018 article for The Print, wrote that the notion that Nehru was the sole decision-maker about Kashmir's status is wrong. According to him, declassified documents, including records of cabinet and defence committee meetings, show clearly that both Nehru and Patel were closely involved in handling all three states \u2013 Kashmir, Junagadh and Hyderabad. Moreover, when Sheikh Abdullah insisted that Article 370 should leave it to J&K's constituent assembly to decide whether to adopt the fundamental rights and directive principles or not, Patel was the one who permitted NG Ayyangar to proceed with it because Nehru was abroad.

To understand this better, one has to understand that Article 35A was inserted by the president by an order under Article 370 in 1954. This means that the parliamentary route was bypassed. However, speaking to The Quint, author Ashok Pandey said: \u201cArticle 35A was never a temporary provision. Article 370 was but that was also first passed by the Constituent Assembly of India and then ratified by Assembly of Kashmir and is no longer temporary, J&K High Court has accepted it as a permanent part of our Constitution.\u201d You can read the full story here.

Ex-ISI Chief\u2019s Son Passes Off Old Clip as Recent Violence in J&K Abdullah Gul, son of the former chief of Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), shared a video on 10 August 2019, claiming that it showed violence in Kashmir. The video was circulated widely on the internet. But it turned out to be an old video from October 2018 when civilians were killed in Kulgam in an encounter between militants and security forces.

Rumour of Yasin Malik\u2019s Death Attributed to BBC Urdu Is False Another piece of misinformation which was bound to have severe repercussions both locally and internationally, was a rumour pertaining to the death of Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front chief Yasin Malik. A video uploaded by a YouTube user claimed that Malik had been killed in an Indian jail. The information was attributed to BBC. But the news organisation had then informed that they had not reported about the death of Yasin Malik.

But this video also turned out to be old and from Pakistan. It purportedly shows Pakistan Army beating detainees in a rural police station for their alleged extremist links.

However, we found old videos from February 2019 and images uploaded by Alamy that indicated that the viral video actually showed a protest by the employees of National Health Mission. The said employees had protested in February 2019 against the government demanding equal pay for equal work among other things. You can read the full story here. Though there were reports of unrest and violence in Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370, a flurry of visuals used on the internet didn\u2019t depict the current situation.", "lang": "en"}
