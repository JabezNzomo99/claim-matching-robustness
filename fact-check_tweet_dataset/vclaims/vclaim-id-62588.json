The headline of the online version of the article incorrectly states that \u201cMore than THIRD of COVID-19 hospital deaths had [diabetes]\u201d.\n\nData published by NHS England on 14 May 2020 shows that, of the 22,332 people who died in a hospital in England between 31 March and 2 May 2020 having tested positive for Covid-19, 26% (5,873) had diabetes according to their patient record.\n\nBut this does not mean that a quarter of Covid-19 deaths were linked to (or caused by) diabetes\n\nIt\u2019s true that diabetes is a reported risk factor for severe Covid-19 illness. It is thought that this is partly down to the fact that diabetes can compromise people\u2019s immune response.\n\nHowever, there are other factors associated with both diabetes and death from Covid-19 that may also explain some of the noted association including demographic factors such as sex and ethnicity and other health problems such as obesity and hypertension.\n\nAs the additional risk factors were not accounted for in the NHS England data, which simply presents descriptive information about the patients who died, it cannot be concluded that a quarter of Covid-19 deaths were linked to diabetes.\n\nThe body of the Daily Express article begins with \u201cMORE than a quarter of Covid-19 patients who have died in hospitals in England had diabetes, NHS data revealed\u201d: a more accurate depiction of the NHS England statistics.\n\nBy way of comparison, about 7% of the general adult population in England are known to have diabetes.\n\nDiabetes UK has said more research is needed to understand the interaction between diabetes and Covid-19.", "lang": "en"}
