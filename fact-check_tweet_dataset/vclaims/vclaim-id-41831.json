The manipulated clip\u2019s layout mimics that of a Facebook page, including a fake views counter and like, comment and share buttons.\n\u2022 A photo of the alleged \u201cdead\u201d personality is superimposed in the thumbnail of the footage together with a news reporter. In this case, it\u2019s Vicky Morales of GMA-7.\n\u2022 Once played, the video rolls for a few seconds and stops. To view the alleged \u201ccomplete\u201d news report, a prompt to \u201cshare\u201d the footage on Facebook appears.\n\nThe doctored nine-second video embedded in cnnupdates.ml was uploaded on April 23, by a YouTube channel named News Reports. It pirated and edited a clip from an April 22 24 Oras reportreport about the shooting of a man in Quezon City at a community quarantine checkpoint.\n\nNews Reports has 12 other rigged videos of fake deaths or accidents of known personalities supposedly announced in the news. The earliest upload was made in September 2019.\n\nThe BB Gandanghari death hoax has garnered over 22 million views in one week.\n\nCnnupdates.ml shares a Google Analytics I.D.
