Jim Doyle, the Wisconsin Republican Party declared:\n\n\"The only time over the last 25 years when the state\u2019s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary.\" We rated the claim .\n\nDating back to 1988, there were 15 months when Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate was higher, all during Burke\u2019s time running Commerce under Doyle. The GOP\u2019s claim only indirectly blamed Burke and we noted that other factors, such as trends in the U.S. economy, affect state unemployment rates.\n\nIn an interview on June 23, 2014, however, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said the state unemployment rate exceeded the national rate for only three months while Burke ran Commerce.\n\nDuring Zepecki\u2019s on \"The Devil\u2019s Advocates,\" a talk show on WXXM-FM (92.1) in Madison, the two co-hosts and Zepecki talked about Burke and Gov. Scott Walker in terms of job creation and unemployment.\n\nCo-host Mike Crute: \"Well, back when Mary Burke was the commerce secretary, I believe 2006-2007, Joe, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent. Of course, they (Republicans) want to say, 'higher than the national average,' for the short time Mary was in that position. But at 4.7 percent, I mean, that is pretty much full employment when she was commerce secretary.\"\n\nZepecki: \"It is, and it was three months, three individual months within her two and a half years where I believe the unemployment rate here was about a tenth of a percentage point higher. Again, this is what they\u2019re doing, just trying to play fast and loose and lay out ways to obscure (Walker\u2019s) failures on jobs.\"\n\nWhen we contacted Zepecki, he began his email response by saying: \"I got this one wrong.\"\n\nZepecki said he made his claim based on his recollection of a chart produced by the state GOP that compared Wisconsin and U.S. unemployment rates during Burke\u2019s time at Commerce. He said the chart seemed to show three periods of time when Wisconsin\u2019s rate exceeded the U.S. rate.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t disagree, as we found in fact-checking the GOP\u2019s claim, that U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show Wisconsin\u2019s rate was higher for 15 months of Burke\u2019s 33-month tenure.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, even when Wisconsin\u2019s rate exceeded the national rate, it was by less than one-half of 1 percentage point.\n\nZepecki said the Wisconsin unemployment rate was higher than the U.S. rate during only three months when Mary Burke was state commerce secretary.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s rate was never more than fourth-tenths of a percentage point higher than the U.S. rate, but it did exceed the U.S. rate for nearly half of of Burke\u2019s 33 months running Commerce.", "lang": "en"}
