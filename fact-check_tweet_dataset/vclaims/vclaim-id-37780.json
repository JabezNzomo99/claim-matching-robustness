Experts and journalists gave the Daily Caller News Foundation lower estimates.\n\nThe Virginia Division of Capitol Police estimated 22,000 people attended the Jan. 20 gun-rights rally in Richmond to protest various recent gun control proposals. Some officials feared violence might occur at the rally, particularly after the FBI announced days before that it had arrested three alleged members of white supremacist group The Base. But, despite these concerns, the rally remained peaceful, with only one reported arrest, according to The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThousands Of Pro-Gun Activists And Far-Right Extremists Swarm Richmond, Virginia,\u201d read HuffPost\u2019s headline for a Jan. 20 article on the rally. (RELATED: Article Claims Trump Will Sign An Executive Order Creating Term Limits For Congress)\n\nTo support the claim, the HuffPost author pointed to the presence of groups such as the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and American Guard, as well as other unnamed \u201cfar-right militants, conspiracy theorists.\u201d Pictures and videos from the rally confirm that members of those groups were, in fact, in attendance.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a legal advocacy group, has designated the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys as \u201cextremists\u201d and the American Guard as a \u201chate group,\u201d while the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish nonprofit organization, characterizes all three groups as \u201cextremists.\u201d\n\nExperts agreed some far-right extremists likely did attend the Richmond gun-rights rally but disputed HuffPost\u2019s \u201cthousands\u201d number.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that some far right extremists attended the event insofar as gun ownership rights loom large in their worldview,\u201d explained George Michael, a professor of criminal justice at Westfield State University and author of \u201cConfronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA,\u201d in an email to the DCNF. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t see evidence of far-right involvement on an organizational level.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen nothing to suggest that there were thousands of far-right extremists in attendance,\u201d said Darren Mulloy, a Wilfrid Laurier University history professor and author of \u201cEnemies of the State: The Radical Right in American from FDR to Trump,\u201d in an email to the DCNF.\n\nLaird Wilcox, co-author of \u201cAmerican Extremists Militias, Supremacists, Klansmen, Communists & Others,\u201d also told the DCNF he did not see evidence that \u201cthousands\u201d of \u201cfar right extremists\u201d attended the rally.\n\n\u201cIt was mostly single-issue people concerned about the Second Amendment. Most of those people were middle to moderate-right conservatives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not \u2018far-right extremists.'\u201d\n\nOnly one journalist that the DCNF talked to speculated the number could be high, but he took pains to make clear his number was an estimate.\n\n\u201cI would say less than, but somewhere hovering around 20% of the folks at the rally likely met this qualification,\u201d said Robert Evans, a Bellingcat investigative reporter present at the gun-rights rally. \u201cI\u2019d say I personally saw somewhere around a dozen [Right Wing Death Squad] patches, in addition to \u2018helicopter\u2019 shirts and imagery (references to how the Pinochet regime executed left-wing dissidents). I also saw hundreds and hundreds of references to the \u2018boogaloo,\u2019 the idea of an inevitable coming second civil war.\u201d\n\nTownhall reporter Julio Rosas told the DCNF that \u201cvery few\u201d members of the aforementioned groups were there, while New2Share editor-in-chief Ford Fischer estimated \u201cin the hundreds.\u201d\n\nBut individuals wearing such imagery aren\u2019t necessarily \u201cfar-right extremists.\u201d On its website, the ADL notes that \u201cgamers and history buffs\u201d make references to \u201cboogaloo.\u201d Some individuals \u201cstill use the phrase as a joke,\u201d according to the ADL.\n\nEven if all such people were considered far-right extremists, there is no definitive way to determine the exact ratio of far-right extremists to gun advocates and other attendees at the rally. Social media only turned up anecdotal instances of such imagery.\n\nNeither the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism nor the Counter Extremism Project, organizations that extensively study and track U.S. extremism, had information about who or what groups attended the rally.\n\n\u201cThis was different from [Charlottesville, Virginia] in many ways in that there hardened bigots and violent extremists were key to the organizing of the event,\u201d Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism Director Brian Levin told the DCNF in an email. \u201cRichmond\u2019s had been going on for years and was not organized by bigots. That being said, outside extremists made a very big deal about the Richmond event online.\u201d\n\nNo other policy organizations could corroborate HuffPost\u2019s claim, and the DCNF found no evidence that \u201cthousands\u201d of \u201cfar-right extremists\u201d attended the rally. We rate this headline false.\n\nTrevor Schakohl and Elias Atienza contributed to this report.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
