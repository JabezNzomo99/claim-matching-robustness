The average payment received from the EU (\u00a327,648) in 2016-17 represented 62.4% of total farm income (\u00a344,305). This ratio fluctuates with market prices; it ranged between 52% and 71% during 2012-13 to 2016-17.\n\nHow much of Northern Ireland farm revenues are coming from EU support?\n\nDuring the BBC Radio Ulster\u2019s Nolan Show on 5 February 2019, two guests debated the percentage of farmers\u2019 income that is coming from Brussels. Jane Morris, former Head of the European Commission Office in Northern Ireland, said that more than 80% of farmers\u2019 income in Northern Ireland is coming from EU cheques: \u201cunder the common agricultural policy for farmers \u2026 over 80% of their whole revenue monthly comes from the European Union\u201d (16:19). Former UKIP Northern Ireland leader David McNarry counter-claimed \u201cit is actually somewhere about 62%\u201d (17:30).\n\nDAERA annually publishes a statistical report on Northern Ireland farm incomes. These reports include average net farm incomes, as well as direct payments coming from the European Union (under the Basic Payment Scheme). In 2016-17, the average net income per farm was \u00a316,387. The average additional payments received from the EU was \u00a327,648 per farm. Thus, 62.4% of the total farm income (\u00a344,305) came from EU payments. This substantiates McNarry\u2019s statement.\n\nThis percentage is not stable, and varies every year. The average incomes and EU payment rates from the past five years are summarised in the following table (in \u00a3 per farm):\n\nFigures for 2017-18 will be published on 28 March 2019.\n\nThe share of EU payments as part of total income also differs highly between farm types. In 2016-17, pig farms \u201care the only farm type to return a positive Net Farm Income when direct payments are removed\u201d. Only 16% of their income (\u00a314,387 of \u00a388,249) comes from EU payments. \u201cCattle and Sheep (LFA)\u201d with 70% (\u00a332,027 of \u00a345,634) and \u201cCereals\u201d with 77% (\u00a330,023 of \u00a339,127) are the farm types with the highest percentages.\n\nPayments that Northern Ireland farms receive are coming from the EU\u2019s common agricultural policy. The CAP was established in 1962, and was meant to provide \u201caffordable food for EU citizens and a fair standard of living for farmers\u201d. Since 2003, the CAP provides income support for farmers. Direct payments, including a basic payment and additional support, are granted directly to farmers to ensure them a safety net. Farms receive payments on the condition that they respect rules for health and environment.\n\nThe amount of payments are given independently from production quantities, in order \u201cto provide EU farmers with a safety net against volatile market prices\u201d. This explains why the percentage of EU payments often differs, while the average payment itself stays more or less stable.\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
