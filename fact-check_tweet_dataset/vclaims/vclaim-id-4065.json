The Elizabeth Tower (the official name of the clock tower commonly known as Big Ben) is currently being renovated but the story about the rotation came from a satire website.\n\nIt originated from an article published on May 2, 2018 by the Southend News Network which was titled \"Work underway to rotate Big Ben so it faces Mecca\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA spokesperson for the Palace of Westminster has confirmed that work to rotate the main clock face of Big Ben so that it faces Mecca is 'progressing nicely,' with the current scaffolding due to be removed by early 2019. According to the Department of Culture and Societal Enrichment, the current faces are directed towards Southend-on-Sea, Brighton, Bristol and Birmingham, and the \u00a3500m taxpayer-funded initiative will ensure that at least one face remains 118.98\u00b0 from true North - the correct co-ordinates to ensure an uninterrupted line with the holy site in Saudi Arabia.

They have a disclaimer on their about page that reads (in part):\n\nSouthend News Network was originally started in October 2015 with no real aims or objectives in mind other than to add a satirical/spoof-like touch to issues that people are passionate about in Southend On Sea. Above all else, SNN is all about having the occasional 'dig' at the powers that be, as well a slightly bigger and more frequent 'dig' at certain elements of local media!\n\nSeveral of their stories have been mistaken for real news in the past and the site was recognized by the local authorities as an \"official news outlet\".\n\nWe wrote about southendnewsnetwork.net before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Donald Trump's UK Trip NOT To Include A Visit to Southend-on-Sea\n\u2022 Fake News: Channel Tunnel NOT To Close Permanently On 30th April In Brexit Dispute\u00c2\n\u2022 Fake News: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Did NOT Name Baby Boy 'Leroy'\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Police Warning, NO Killer Animals Escaped From Essex Zoo\n\u2022 Fake News: 100% (NOT Just 84%) of UK's Tap Water is Halal", "lang": "en"}
