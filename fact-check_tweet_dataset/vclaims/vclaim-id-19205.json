MY QUESTION?? Why isn\u2019t this in headlines on EVERY major network?\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAs is typical with fabricated internet conspiracy theories, the significant discovery wasn\u2019t in the headlines of \"EVERY\" major news network because it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe false rumor has been shared in various other viral social media posts, as well, and appears to have originated in an Aug. 13 article posted by conspiracy website whatdoesitmean.com.\n\nThe headline of that article? \"FBI Divers Recover Human Bones In Waters Off Epstein \u2018Orgy Island\u2019 As \u2018Deep State\u2019 Meltdown Accelerates.\"\n\nThe website, and author \"Sorcha Faal,\" are known to spread disinformation by including existing fragments of legitimate news in their stories (in this case by writing that Epstein owned an island and the FBI raided the premises) and then use that as a base to construct outrageous fake narratives, claiming to be the first to break the story with no credible sources.\n\nA group of FBI investigators did raid Epstein\u2019s island on Aug. 12, but there were no reports of human bones found anywhere, including below \"Epstein\u2019s satanic temple,\" as the article claims.\n\nNews organizations around the world have reported extensively and in great detail on the Epstein case, so the fact that no credible media outlet revealed any of this information further points to it being fabricated.", "lang": "en"}
