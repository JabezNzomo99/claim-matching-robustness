The tweet was accompanied by photographs showing the white cargo trucks typically used in these \u201chumanitarian convoys\u201d and bearing the insignia of the Russian Ministry of Extreme Situations, as well as photos of some of the humanitarian aid, packaged and stacked on palettes.\n\nAccording to the tweet, the vehicles in this convoy were inspected by customs services at the border to verify the trucks\u2019 contents. However, a crucial detail is missing: it does not say whose customs service inspected the trucks. Russia\u2019s \u201chumanitarian aid convoys\u201d cross from Russia into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine, and the border between these regions is controlled by Russia and the customs service of the separatist pseudo-states known as the Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics. In other words, the aid is going to the same forces Russia is accused (with overwhelming evidence) of supporting militarily and logistically. These convoys have come under scrutiny in the past.\n\nThe OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has tried to monitor the convoys in the past, but its members have often been blocked by armed men on the pro-Russian side.\n\n\n\n \u201cIn Luhansk city, the SMM saw five white cargo trucks in a compound known to us as used by the armed formations at 2a Rudnieva Street and that they were being unloaded by men in blue work uniforms without visible insignia, but could not see the cargo,\u201d reads an SMM report from May 25, 2018.\n\n\u201cOne of the trucks was labeled \u2018Humanitarian Aid from the Russian Federation:\u2019the other trucks were not labeled. The SMM saw three armed men in military-type clothing standing around the perimeter of the compound. At the entrance of the compound, an armed man in military-type clothing told the SMM that it could not enter and that none of the people traveling with the convoy could speak to the SMM without permission from the armed formations in Luhansk.\u201d\n\nIn a May 31 report to the head of the OSCE observation mission, the interim charg\u00e9 d\u2019ffaires of the U.S. Mission to the OSCE, Harry Kamian, alluded to Ukrainian border guards stationed at the Donetsk border crossing point, but noted that they had no opportunity to inspect the trucks.\n\n\u201cMr. Chair, markings or no markings, we have no idea what is actually inside these supposed humanitarian aid convoys, because the Russian Federation will not let the Observer Mission or the SMM inspect them or watch them unload,\u201d Kamian said. \u201cWe do know, however, that these so-called aid trucks did not unload at any hospital, school, NGO, or UN warehouse. Rather, they were unloaded at a compound the SMM reported as used by Russia-led forces. Armed men in military uniforms guarded its perimeter and prevented the SMM monitors from seeing the cargo or speaking with anyone on site.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the concerns of the OSCE SMM, Russian and non-Russian journalists alike have noted anomalies in past convoys. For example, some of the trucks were almost two-thirds empty. The convoys have often been spotted being accompanied by military vehicles, including fighting vehicles.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry has repeatedly protested the convoys, pointing to the \u201ccontinued illegal supply of weapons, armored vehicles and mercenaries from Russia.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, they acknowledge that the Russian border is not controlled by the Ukraine government nor does Russia allow inspections of the convoys.", "lang": "en"}
