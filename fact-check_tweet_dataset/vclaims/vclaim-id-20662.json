They claimed the 1929 structure in the small town of Strunino is dilapidated and that the local government is stripping away from their community vitally important healthcare services.\n\n\"What we're looking at on the screen right now obviously needs -- that, yes -- obviously needs your special attention,\u201d President Putin said, turning the microphone over to the minister of health in Moscow and the governor of the Vladimir region who explained she is spearheading reform of health care in the region.\n\n\"Strunino is, of course, a small town, 14,000 residents in 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the main city, Alexandrov,\u201d said Governor Svetlana Sokolova. \u201cAnd I think we will most definitely work on rebuilding that clinic there, especially since there is a need there.\"\n\nIt should be noted that a TV presenter was standing with the women in the small and remote town \u2013 the logistics for live TV certainly an indication that the encounter was preset.\n\n\u201cThese things are always scripted,\u201d says Stephen Blank, senior fellow on Russia at the American Foreign Policy Council. \u201cThey don\u2019t just cut to a local reporter in the boondocks.\u201d\n\nThe TV presenter asked the Stunino women if there were happy, which is when the event seemed to go off script, leading to the citizen fact check.\n\n\"They said it's [the children's clinic] open but it's not,\u201d said one woman.\n\n\u201cEverything she said \u2026 is a lie,\u201d said another.\n\nThis was Putin\u2019s 16th annual session of \u201cDirect Line.\u201d He answers live questions by phone, text message and video calls. The event was hosted by Andrey Kondrashev, a press secretary of Putin\u2019s election campaign and a deputy CEO of VGTRK, Kremlin-owned media group, and Kirill Kleimenov, a TV anchor from another Kremlin TV channel, Channel One. The format is widely seen as benefiting Putin, sometimes at the expense of local officials who answer many of the questions put to the president.\n\nAccording to the latest poll by the Russian independent Levada Center, 75% of Russians approve Vladimir Putin\u2019s presidency, while 41% blame the local governors for the socio-economic hardships.\n\n\u201cI believe these events are always scripted, however that does not mean that the performers might go off the rails,\u201d said Blank.\n\nInterestingly, RT isolated the exchange and put it up on its YouTube channel.", "lang": "en"}
