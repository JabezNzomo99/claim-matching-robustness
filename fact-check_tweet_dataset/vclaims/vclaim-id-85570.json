The theory has been widely debunked, in part because an effort of this size would require the cooperation of tens of thousands of people \u2014 who then would keep it all a secret.\n\nShe aimed to hear out her constituents and refute what she called \u201crelentless\u201d concerns. While she had yet to come out with a stance of her own, she said she didn\u2019t want to \u201cignore what many people in her district were concerned about\u201d and hoped the meeting would be \u201cinformational and educational.\u201d\n\nHowever, the ad\u2019s claim that Ward \u201cwasted your tax dollars\u201d for this town hall appears to be a stretch. The two environmental staffers who Ward had arranged to speak are paid with taxpayer dollars. But public outreach is part of their normal duties. They may have received some kind of standard reimbursement for travel, but no significant amount of money appears to have been spent. Furthermore, the town hall was held at the Board of Supervisors Auditorium in Kingman. The building is publicly owned and maintained with taxpayer funds. Public meetings, like the one Ward hosted, are frequently hosted in the building.\n\nWhen a resident raised the possibility of introducing chemtrails legislation, Ward did say she was \u201copen,\u201d and that she \u201cintroduces legislation for constituents all the time,\u201d as the ad claims. However, the ad uses her statement in a misleading way. She is clear that passing such legislation would be difficult unless \u201cyou get away from the chemtrail issue.\u201d Here\u2019s Ward\u2019s full answer:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll just say I don\u2019t know. If there were a way, I mean, I\u2019m open. I introduce legislation for constituents all the time. It\u2019s not my legislation. A lot of times I\u2019m getting things from people. So, if it\u2019s something that can be done in Arizona statute, I\u2019m always willing to entertain that. With this particular issue, I think it is going to be difficult because unless you get away from the chemtrail issue that you all are so passionate about, talking about our environmental quality I think can go farther in terms of making sure that there aren\u2019t any public health issues that are out there with our water, our soil, or our air.\u201d\n\nDuring the two-hour event, Ward never specifically stated her own beliefs. She did, however, note there was more concern on the issue in her district than other western districts and that she had not seen evidence of the effects people were concerned about from existing environmental testing. Ward also promised bring more experts who would be able to answer the group\u2019s questions.\n\nStill, Ward hasn\u2019t always been clear on the issue. She did not state a personal position at the town hall. Then, six months later, while she was deciding whether to run against McCain, she told the Arizona Republic she \u201cdidn\u2019t really have any opinions about \u2018chemtrails\u2019 one way or the other.\u201d But less than a month later, she took a firm stand on the issue both in an interview with Politico and on Twitter saying, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund claims that Ward\u2019s quotes from the town hall were shortened to save time, noting that the ad used ellipses on screen to indicate that there was more said on either side of the quote that was used. The group also says Ward\u2019s initial response to the chemtrail conspiracy was hardly a stern rebuke.\n\nThis is a classic case of a clip job in a political ad that leaves out a lot of context. The attack ad says that Ward is \u201ccrazy\u201d and has her \u201chead in the clouds\u201d because she hosted a town hall on chemtrails and said she would do it again. The ad even tries to pin a label on her \u2014 \u201cChemtrail Kelli Ward.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
