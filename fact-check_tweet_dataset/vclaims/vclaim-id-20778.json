No, that's not true: no actual evidence for this claim has been uncovered so far and the site making the accusation habitually takes bits and pieces from real news articles and then adds an invented claim to the headline and first paragraph in order to drive more traffic and make more money through advertising.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by YourNewsWire on June 10, 2018 titled \"Investigators: Anthony Bourdain Was Killed By Clinton Operatives\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAnthony Bourdain had been harassed and threatened by Hillary Clinton operatives just weeks before he was found dead in an apparent \"suicide.\" According to investigators, Mr. Bourdain was planning to expose pedophile rings connected to Hollywood and D.C. shortly before his death. His body found Friday after reportedly hanging himself. He was just 61 years old.\n\nThe only \"evidence\" the site provides is a tweet from Bourdain in which he claims to have been on the receiving end of Hillary Clinton \"operatives\".\n\nWhile that may count as \"motive\" it certainly wouldn't be enough for a conviction in a court of law. That would require far more evidence (like video, fingerprints, phone records, wiretaps, signed confessions...), something the unnamed \"investigators\" from the article don't provide.\n\nBottom line: one tweet and vague claims by anonymous \"investigators\" is not enough to convict someone for murder.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Melinda Gates Did NOT Say We Must Discriminate Against All White People\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Order White Women To Breed With Muslims\n\u2022 Fake News: Trump NOT Set To Legalize Medical Marijuana In All 50 States\n\u2022 Fake News: CNN NOT Raided By FCC For Deceiving American Public", "lang": "en"}
