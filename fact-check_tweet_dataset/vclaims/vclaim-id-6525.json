President Trump again this week suggested in a meeting with senators that thousands of illegal voters were bused from Massachusetts to New Hampshire and that\u2019s what caused his defeat in the state of New Hampshire, also the defeat of Senator Kelly Ayotte. That has provoked a response from a member of the Federal Election Commission, Ellen Weintraub, who says, \u201cI call upon the president to immediately share New Hampshire voter fraud evidence so that his allegations may be investigated promptly.\u201d Do you have that evidence?\n\nStephanopoulus is referring to a Feb. 10 Politico report of a closed-door meeting Trump held with senators to discuss the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court: \u201cThe president claimed that he and Ayotte both would have been victorious in the Granite State if not for the \u2018thousands\u2019 of people who were \u2018brought in on buses\u2019 from neighboring Massachusetts to \u2018illegally\u2019 vote in New Hampshire. According to one participant who described the meeting, \u2018an uncomfortable silence\u2019 momentarily overtook the room.\u201d\n\nThis is false. PolitiFact New Hampshire in November gave the state\u2019s governor, Chris Sununu, a \u201cPants on Fire\u201d for claiming that voters were bused in \u2014 and Sununu quickly retreated from his comment. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner said voter fraud was not widespread problem, largely because the law requires voters to show a valid identification at the polls. If an ID is lacking, the voter\u2019s photo is taken, they have to sign an affidavit affirming their identify and then state officials follow up.\n\nSununu later said he did not mean to imply that \u201cI see buses coming over,\u201d saying it was more of a figure of speech. \u201cSununu said he was referring to an incident over Portsmouth state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark allowing Democratic staffers to live at her house in the 2008 and 2012 elections,\u201d PolitiFact reported. \u201cThose staffers voted in New Hampshire elections using Fuller Clark\u2019s address, which is not illegal, as they were living in the state at least 3 months before the election, the Attorney General later ruled.\u201d\n\nAs to the 14 percent figure \u2014 stemming from research by Old Dominion University professors, using data from 2008 and 2010 \u2014 that also has been misrepresented by Trump and his staff. They have ignored updates and challenges to the research. The researchers have also warned that \u201cit is impossible to tell for certain whether the noncitizens who responded to the survey were representative of the broader population of noncitizens.\u201d\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You can\u2019t make a \u2014 hold on a second. You just claimed again that there was illegal voting in New Hampshire, people bused in from the state of Massachusetts. Do you have any evidence to back that up? MILLER: I\u2019m saying anybody \u2014 George, go to New Hampshire. Talk to anybody who has worked in politics there for a long time. Everybody is aware of the problem in New Hampshire with respect to \u2014 STEPHANOPOULOS: I\u2019m asking you as the White House senior \u2014 hold on a second. I\u2019m asking you as the White House senior policy adviser. The president made a statement, saying he was the victim of voter fraud, people are being bused from \u2014 MILLER: And the president \u2014 the president \u2014 the president was. STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you have any evidence? MILLER: If this is an issue that interests you, then we can talk about it more in the future. And we now have \u2014 our governance is beginning to get stood up. But we have a Department of Justice and we have more officials. An issue of voter fraud is something we\u2019re going to be looking at very seriously and very hard. But the reality is, is that we know for a fact, you have massive numbers of noncitizens registered to vote in this country. Nobody disputes that.\n\nMILLER: We should stop the presses. And, as a country, we should be aghast about the fact that you have people who have no right to vote in this country registered to vote, canceling out the franchise of lawful citizens of this country. That\u2019s the story we should be talking about. And I\u2019m prepared to go on any show, anywhere, anytime, and repeat it and say the president of the United States is correct 100 percent. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, you just repeated, though, you just made those declarations. But, for the record, you have provided zero evidence that the president was the victim of massive voter fraud in New Hampshire. You provided zero evidence that the president\u2019s claim that he would have won the general \u2014 the popular vote \u2014 if 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants hadn\u2019t voted, zero evidence for either one of those claims.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty ridiculous to cite research in a way that even the researcher says is inappropriate, and yet Miller keeps saying 14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote. The Republican governor of New Hampshire has admitted that he was wrong to say buses of illegal voters voted in the election, and yet Miller shamelessly suggests that is the case. Miller cites a supposed expert on voter fraud, Kobach, who has been mocked for failing to prove his own claims of voter fraud. Miller also repeats a claim about people being registered to vote in two states, even though that is not an example of voter fraud.", "lang": "en"}
