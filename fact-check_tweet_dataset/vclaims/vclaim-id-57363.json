In other words, they argued that the fish was actually relatively small \u2014 it was just being held closer to the camera to make it appear larger.\n\nWhile forced-perspective photography has been the impetus of countless internet rumors (we\u2019ve previously written about the non-existence of 110-pound squirrels and 42-pound frogs), this photograph of a 327-pound halibut appears to be real. A little forced perspective might be at play, but, in general, this is a real picture of a really big fish.\n\nThis fish was caught circa Aug. 12, 2020, in Seward, Alaska, by a fisherman aboard a charter fishing boat operated by the J-Dock Fishing Company. This charter fishing business shared a second photograph of this catch to its Facebook page:\n\nWhile we haven\u2019t ventured off to Alaska to verify this fish\u2019s measurements, we can say that a 327-pound halibut is well within reason. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration writes that halibut, one of the world\u2019s largest flatfish, can grow to more than 8 feet long, and can weigh in excess of 500 pounds.\n\nAccording to The International Game and Fish Association, Jack Tragis is the current record holder for largest Pacific Halibut, having reeled in a 459-pound fish off the shores of Dutch Harbor, Alaska, in 1996.", "lang": "en"}
