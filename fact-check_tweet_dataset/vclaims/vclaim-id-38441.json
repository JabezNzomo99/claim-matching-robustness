The photograph was shared on 24 January 2019 on the official Facebook page of AFC Asia Cup.\n\nOn going through the comments on the Twitter thread, we came across a tweet by a Mohammed Sadre which had a photo of the same photographer which showed him wearing an outfit with the Iraqi flag on it. While looking for news reports about the same, we came across an article which identified the photographer as Mohammed al-Azzawi. On looking up his name on Twitter, we came across a tweet by Steven Nabi, a TV correspondent at Alhurra News, which confirmed the same information.\n\nNabi\u2019s tweet was dated 24 January 2019 as well. Upon looking up the keywords \u2018Iraqi photographer Asian Cup\u2019 on Twitter, we came across a tweet which had both the photos being used by the viral post, this time dated to 28 January 2019.\n\nTherefore, the post doing the rounds on social media has been photoshopped and is being shared with a false claim. The image of the photographer crying is old and has been taken out of context.", "lang": "en"}
