Statement is over.\u201d\n\n\n\nAuthorities in Moscow have said jail time of up to 5 years is a possibility for those returning from high-risk countries and not isolating. Russia also said in February that it was deporting foreign nationals who it said had violated quarantine restrictions.\n\nHowever, at the time of writing this article, Russia has not ordered a nationwide lockdown such as those happening in Italy or the UK; reportedly some areas have closed restaurants, sports facilities and limited public gatherings, and Moscow is paying its elderly to stay home.\n\nThere is also a system in place to quarantine people crossing the border into Russia, but there are no nationwide restrictions as described in this post.", "lang": "en"}
