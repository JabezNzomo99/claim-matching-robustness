We are talking about \u201cSubway Surfers\u201d, wherein players take the role of young graffiti artists who, upon being caught, run through railway tracks to escape the police. As they run, they collect gold coins and other items, while dodging trains and other objects.\n\nOn social media, a tragic story regarding the origin of the game is being circulated. It is being said that the creator of \u201cSubway Surfers\u201d had made the game in memory of his son who had died while skating down the railway tracks.\n\nThe post is viral on Facebook and Twitter. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be fictitious.\n\nWhile trying to figure out how this claim could have started, we came across a deleted tweet made on July 29 by a Twitter handle called \u201c@adorebestlads\u201d. This handle seems to be one of the first to make the viral claim.\n\nOn July 30, this user apologised for posting unverified content, but by then, it had already been picked up by a large number of social media accounts. SYBO Games, the co-founder of \u201cSubway Surfers\u201d, had said in a reply to \u201c@adorebestlads\u201d that it had created the game as a mark of respect to street culture and diversity.\n\nWe found a YouTube video, wherein SYBO Games CEO Mathias Gredal Norvig himself narrates the story behind the creation of \u201cSubway Surfers\u201d.\n\nHe says, \u201cThe influences for the game were a mix of passion, street culture, fashion, animation, music, graffiti, skateboarding.\u201d Nowhere does he mention about the tragic story being told in the claim.\n\nAccording to \u201cdailymotion.com\u201d, the two founders of SYBO Games, Sylvester Rishoj Jensen and Bodie Jahn-Mulliner, had won the first prize for the \u2018best animation movie\u2019 following which they created the game in 2012.", "lang": "en"}
