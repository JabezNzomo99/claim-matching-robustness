The report has also been circulated in several WhatsApp groups.\n\nOliha was part of the Super Eagles team that took part in the United States 1994 World Cup football tournament.\n\nThe news published on 5th July, 2020 was authored by Damilare Salami.\n\nBased on Salami\u2019s profile at the footer of the article, he is the Brand and Products Editor at the City People Magazine. The article was written like a fresh report without an indication to show that it is several years old.\n\nThe author did not state that the deceased died in 2013 even though he reported the date, time and location of Oliha\u2019s death.\n\nMoreover, several articles which reported the late Oliha\u2019s death affirmed that the ex-footballer died in June, 2013.\n\nThe ICIR reached out to Yusuf Abdulraheem, the Chief Medical Director of Yusjib Industrial Medicare Care, the same medical doctor the author quoted in the news report.\n\nAbdulraheem clarified that the deceased died seven years ago.\n\n\u201cThompson Oliha didn\u2019t die five days ago. He died exactly seven years, five days ago,\u201d he told The ICIR on Sunday, July 5, 2020.\n\nAccording to Abdulraheem, he was at the hospital located along Ajase \u2013 Ipo road, Ilorin, Kwara State at about 4:06 am when the incident happened.\n\nHe said Oliha was rushed to the emergency unit of the hospital but was already lifeless.\n\n\u201cHe was brought in dead,\u201d Abdulraheem said. \u201cImmediately I saw him, he was already cold and turned blue. There was no pulse. Clinically he was dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pronounced him dead at 4:06 am in June 2013,\u201d the doctor stressed.\n\nThe Edo State Chairman of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Ahmed Agbona said he attended the burial of Oliha.\n\nAgbona stated that there might be another Thompson Oliha as the Oliha\u2019s family is popular in Edo State.\n\nHe however stressed that, the Oliha who was the teammate of Daniel Amokachi in the 1994 National Team died in 2013.\n\n\u201cI am from Edo State. I was part of those that buried him,\u201d Agbona noted.\n\nMeanwhile, other independent findings by The ICIR revealed that the picture used for the story was first published in 2013.\n\nBased on all evidence available, the claim is MISLEADING.", "lang": "en"}
