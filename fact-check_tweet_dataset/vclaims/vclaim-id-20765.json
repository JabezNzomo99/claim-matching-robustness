In exchange, North Korea agreed to freeze and dismantle its nuclear weapons program.\n\nBy the time the deal broke down years later, during the presidency of George W. Bush, the aid the United States had provided amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 not \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nFrom 1994 to 2003, the United States contributed over $400 million in financial support to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, or K.E.D.O., the international consortium tasked with overseeing the project. Most of that money went toward fuel shipments.", "lang": "en"}
