In the video, Waris Pathan asks Police personnel not to shut mosque and loudspeaker and allow people to offer namaz. But, FACTLY has found the video to be of an incident in 2016. An argument erupted between the then Byculla MLA Waris Pathan and local Police over the volume of a loudspeaker in a mosque in Byculla. Waris Pathan has also posted the same video on his Facebook account on 14 November 2016. Waris Pathan lost in the Assembly elections of 2019 and he is no more the MLA representing Byculla.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
