It\u2019s impossible to cost a manifesto that hasn\u2019t been released yet. As no other party has released its manifesto either, it\u2019s also impossible to compare to the cost of any other party\u2019s policies (including the Conservatives\u2019).\n\nThe list includes a number of policies that Labour hasn\u2019t so far said will be in its manifesto and one (the abolition of private schools) that Labour has ruled out. Other numbers seem overstated, either by double counting costs or assuming Labour would introduce the fully fledged policy from day one, rather than phasing it in. Some of the figures are reasonable, and some are taken directly from Labour\u2019s own announcements.\n\nOver half of the \u00a31.2 trillion figure is based on the Conservatives\u2019 estimate of the cost of Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto, but it\u2019s not clear how many policies from that will appear in the 2019 version.\n\nAround half of the \u00a31.2 trillion over five years comes from a costing of Labour\u2019s 2017 election manifesto. It includes figures put forward by Labour at the time as well as the Conservatives\u2019 estimate of Labour\u2019s \u2018uncosted\u2019 spending from the manifesto.\n\nIn 2017 Labour said that its manifesto policies would cost \u00a348.6 billion a year in day to day spending. Over five years that\u2019s \u00a3243 billion. At the time, Labour also put forward tax measures it claimed would pay for that spending.\n\nLabour also said in 2017 it wanted to spend around \u00a325 billion a year on infrastructure and investment\u2014over five years that\u2019s \u00a3125 billion.\n\nWhen the 2017 Labour manifesto was originally published the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that a number of Labour\u2019s policies could turn out to be more costly than it had estimated.\n\nThat still leaves another \u00a3243 billion that the Conservatives say is \u2018uncosted spending\u2019 from the last manifesto. A large chunk of this comes from the supposed cost of Labour\u2019s plans to renationalise rail, energy networks, water and postal services which the Conservatives have factored in at \u00a3196 billion.\n\nThis figure comes from analysis by the CBI, and when we fact checked it back in October we found that the methodology behind the figure was disputed and didn\u2019t take into account the potential economic benefits of nationalisation.\n\nThe Conservatives also seem to have double counted the cost of renationalising the National Grid under both Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto and under new spending since then.\n\nThe National Grid is part of the \u00a3196 billion price tag for nationalisation from Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto, according to the CBI\u2019s analysis. But it\u2019s also reportedly part of a separate \u00a3124 billion pot of money the Conservatives say is the cost of renationalising the \u2018Big Six\u2019 energy supply companies\u2014an extension of Labour\u2019s 2017 energy pledges.\n\nThe \u00a3124 billion figure is based on analysis by stock brokerage firm Jefferies from 2015. As far as we can tell, Jefferies never publicly released their methodology, but multiple press reports at the time said that it was an estimate of the cost of nationalising the Big Six as well as the National Grid.\n\nAccording to a chart in the Guardian based on Jefferies\u2019 figures, just under \u00a360 billion of the \u00a3124 billion estimate was due to the value of the National Grid.\n\nThe Conservatives also said that Labour\u2019s plan to upgrade UK housing and install energy saving measures will cost \u00a330 billion over five years.\n\nThis figure does seem to be in line with Labour\u2019s own calculations. When it announced the policy last week it said it would cost \u00a3250 billion in total, with \u00a360 billion of that coming from public spending under a Labour government by 2030. The Conservatives have taken this total for around 10 years and halved it to get a five year figure of \u00a330 billion.\n\nAnother figure which seems to originate with Labour is the \u00a350 billion allocated to a housing grant for socially rented homes. A motion voted for at Labour\u2019s party conference called on the party to commit to setting aside \u00a310 billion a year to build 100,000 socially rented homes.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean this is definitely going to be in Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto.\n\nThe Conservatives multiplied \u00a310 billion by five to get to \u00a350 billion, which assumes that Labour would start implementing the policy straight away once in government.\n\nLabour recently announced at its party conference in September that in government it would look to reduce the average full-time working week to 32 hours within the next decade. The Conservatives say this will cost \u00a385 billion over five years, or \u00a317 billion a year.\n\nThat is based on research done by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), a centre-right think tank, which estimated that moving to a 32 hour week would cost between \u00a326 billion and \u00a345 billion a year, depending on how you calculated the average number of hours people work at the moment. The CPS also said that in an \u201cincredibly optimistic\u201d scenario, increased productivity from working longer hours could generate \u00a39 billion, leaving the cost of the policy at at least \u00a317 billion.\n\nBut the Conservatives seem to have assumed that Labour would introduce this policy from day one of a Labour government, rather than phasing it in over a decade as Labour have previously said.\n\nThe Conservatives say \u00a335 billion of the total cost would come from Labour\u2019s policy to abolish private schools.\n\nLabour said in a press release on 31 October this year that this was not its policy. The Labour party conference in September did pass a vote supporting the integration of private schools into the state sector and the redistribution of their assets, but that does not commit the party to including the policy in its manifesto.\n\nThe currently stated Labour policy is to remove charitable status and various tax benefits from private schools, and then (as their press release put it) \u201cask the Social Justice Commission to consider the ways in which we can integrate private schools into the state sector\u201d.\n\nBut even if it was Labour policy, the Conservatives\u2019 calculations are flawed.\n\nThe Conservatives added together estimates from consultancy Oxford Economics for the amount they say independent schools save the taxpayer by teaching pupils who would otherwise have a state education (\u00a33.5 billion per year) and the amount of tax revenue generated from independent schools (\u00a33.5 billion per year), and multiplied by five to get the \u00a335 billion figure.\n\nThe Conservatives actually used the wrong figure for the amount of revenue generated by private schools. Oxford Economics estimated that independent schools contributed \u00a34.1 billion of tax per year (\u00a33.5 billion was only a subset of independent schools).\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s wrong to say that closing private schools would mean the government sees a reduction in tax revenues. The tax revenue figure covers tax currently generated through spending by independent schools. This includes things like tax paid by teachers and tax generated when schools buy things, but a lot of that would be generated if the private schools closed and the state sector had to expand too.\n\nEstimations like these are uncertain, but a better estimate is that moving privately educated pupils into the state sector would cost \u00a33.5 billion a year\u2014half of what the Conservatives have estimated.\n\nAround \u00a367 billion in the analysis comes from what the Conservatives say is Labour\u2019s policy of \u201cearly retirement for women born in the 1950s\u201d. In 2017, after the general election, Labour pledged to \u201callow these women to retire up to two years early.\u201d\n\nThe state pension age is rising and in 2011 the government passed measures to speed up how quickly this was happening, meaning almost five million people would not be able to claim the state pension until later than they originally thought.\n\nThe Conservatives said they took the average value of the state pension for women in 2018/19 and multiplied by the additional number of people who would receive the state pension under Labour\u2019s plans for a duration of two years. This includes back-payments for women who didn\u2019t receive their pension so soon.\n\nWe haven\u2019t been able to replicate the Conservatives\u2019 calculations and there is not enough detail on Labour\u2019s proposals to accurately estimate the cost of their policy. We\u2019ve asked both for more information.\n\nAnother figure that the Conservatives have taken straight from Labour is the proposed cost of upgrading school buildings. In 2018 Labour said it would spend \u00a314 billion to upgrade school buildings, and that would include fire safety measures such as fitting sprinklers and removing potentially flammable cladding. It\u2019s unclear what period Labour intended this to be spent over.\n\nThe Conservatives say Labour\u2019s plans on public sector pay would cost around \u00a338 billion over five years. That\u2019s based on a statement Jeremy Corbyn made in July 2018, backing trade union calls for a 5% rise in public sector pay.\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 cost estimate is based on the above-inflation cost of a 5% pay rise every year for five years (though we\u2019ve not been able to replicate their exact calculations). But there\u2019s no suggestion from Labour that the demand for a 5% pay rise was intended to be every year, so this could overstate Labour\u2019s intentions.\n\nThe Conservative party seems to have tried to avoid double counting in this instance. Its initial estimate of this policy was \u00a358 billion, but around \u00a320 billion of the amount was already included in Labour\u2019s costings of their 2017 manifesto. Labour estimated lifting the public sector pay cap would cost \u00a34 billion a year (we fact checked this in 2017 and found it was a reasonable estimate for raising public sector pay in line with inflation).\n\nThe Conservatives say that Labour\u2019s public health pledges would cost \u00a33.2 billion per year or \u00a316 billion over five.\n\nThat is based on Labour\u2019s repetition of the Health Foundation\u2019s calculations from 2018 that an additional \u00a33.2 billion a year is needed to reverse the impact of decreased funding to public health services.\n\nWe can\u2019t find evidence that Labour has actually pledged to increase spending by this amount if it got into government, although Johnathan Ashworth did ask ministers in 2018 to reverse the cuts in that year\u2019s budget.\n\nThe Conservatives calculate that scrapping Universal Credit will cost \u00a316 billion, and point to multiple associated costs: infrastructure for a new benefit system; ending the benefit cap; ending the two child limit; and recruiting 5,000 additional advisers. These are all things which Labour has pledged to do.\n\nBy far the biggest single estimated cost is almost \u00a315 billion, which the Conservatives say is the cost of Labour\u2019s pledge to remove the two child limit which means most parents can only receive child tax credit for the first two children they have. The Conservatives say the two child limit \u201cwas estimated to have saved\u201d \u00a33 billion a year.\n\nThis seems to come from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which says the two child limit is expected to reduce government spending by \u00a33 billion \u201cin the long run\u201d. The Conservatives used this as an annual figure and factored in that changes to this policy were made in 2019 which cost around \u00a3250 million.\n\nBut \u00a33 billion wouldn\u2019t be wouldn\u2019t be the cost of reversing the policy in each of the next five years. The two child limit was expected to lead to spending reductions of \u00a3310 million in 2017/18, rising to \u00a31.6 billion in 2020/21 and \u00a32 billion by 2021/22, according to the House of Commons Library, so it hasn\u2019t yet reached the \u00a33 billion figure projected by the IFS.\n\nThe Conservative party also claims that ending the benefit cap will cost \u00a3190 million a year, or \u00a3950 million over five years. Its source is a parliamentary report which says the \u00a3190 million figure is \u201clikely to be an overestimate\u201d.\n\nThe Conservatives estimated that Labour\u2019s pledge to deliver free personal care in England would cost \u00a332 billion over five years. This seems fair.\n\nPersonal care is help for those who need assistance with things like diet, mobility and simple treatments, and is already free in Scotland.\n\nHealthcare think tank The King\u2019s Fund estimated expanding this to England would cost an extra \u00a36 billion in 2020/21 and \u00a38 billion by 2030/31.\n\nThe Conservatives assumed an incremental increase in cost of \u00a30.2 billion a year over the first five years, getting to \u00a332 billion over the whole period.\n\nWhat has Labour said?\n\nAt the time of writing, Labour hadn\u2019t yet released its manifesto for the 2019 election, so we don\u2019t know exactly which policies it will include or how much they\u2019re likely to cost.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said in response to the Conservatives\u2019 analysis:\n\n\u201cThis ludicrous piece of Tory fake news is an incompetent mish-mash of debunked estimates and bad maths\u2026 The Conservatives will be able to read all about [Labour\u2019s] plans \u2013 and how much they actually cost \u2013 when we publish our fully costed manifesto.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
