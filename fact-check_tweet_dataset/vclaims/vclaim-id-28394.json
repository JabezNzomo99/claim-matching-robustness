In the second image, the child can be seen crying after her head was bandaged.\n\nThe same image was received on BOOM's Whatsapp helpline number 7700906111 for verification.\n\nThe set of images are doing the rounds with the caption, \"The little girl was not spared by Jihadis in West Bengal.\"\n\n\n\nThe tweet is archived here.\n\nAnti-CAA protest turned violent in West Bengal last week when protesters pelted stones at the Coromandel Express that was stationed at the Uluberia station. Videos showing protesters vandalising public property of railway stations of the Murshidabad district, have gone viral since. However, Sanjoy Ghosh, PRO of South Eastern Railway confirmed to The Telegraph that no passenger was injured.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found that the image of the minor is originally from Bangladesh and not related to the anti-CAA protests in West Bengal. She has been identified as Mahima Akhter, who was injured in a train accident in November this year. According to reports, two trains Udayan and Turna Nishita Express collided in Kasba, Brahmanberia resulting in injuries of multiple passengers. You can see the image here.\n\nDuring the accident two and half year old Mahima Akhter got separated from her parents with whom she was travelling, reported Daily Bangladesh . Mahima's image was viral on social media in an effort to identify her parents. They later reached the hospital to take Mahima home. More on the incident can be read here.", "lang": "en"}
