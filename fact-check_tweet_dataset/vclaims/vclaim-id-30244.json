On January 9, 2019, Twitter user Sanjeevani posted the video with the message, \u201cHere\u2019s how Kerala welcomed RSS bike rally today!

A group of people attacked a bike rally taken out in support of a strike called in the wake of Sabarimala verdict where the top court allowed the entry of menstruating women in the temple. The rally was held at Edappal in Malappuram district of Kerala. A dawn to dusk hartal was organized by Sabarimala Karma Samithi. According to a report by Kerala news website Manorama, Sabarimala Karma Samithi is a joint platform of Right-wing outfits and BJP, which oppose the entry of women in 10-50 age group into the temple.\n\nIn conclusion, a year-old video of a rally of supporters of hartal against Sabarimala verdict attacked by a mob is shared as a recent video of \u201ccommunists\u201d attacking pro-CAA rally by BJP-RSS.\n\n[Update: Madhu Kishwar\u2019s retweet has been added to the report on January 10, 2020.]", "lang": "en"}
