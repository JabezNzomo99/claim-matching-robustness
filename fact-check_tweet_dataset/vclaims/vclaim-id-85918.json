Mary Landrieu (D-La.), so the pro-Democratic group Senate Majority PAC has made AFP\u2019s main backers, the Koch brothers, the subject of a new attack ad. This is all part of a larger Democratic strategy of tying GOP candidates to the conservative billionaires, as witnessed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s near-daily attacks on them.\n\nA number of the claims in the ad we have covered before, such as the hyperbolic charge that Republicans want to \u201cend Medicare.\u201d The so-called Social Security cuts stem in part from changing the formula for indexing benefits to inflation \u2014 something also supported by President Obama. And AFP did not oppose hurricane relief; it opposed a version that it believed was fiscally irresponsible. (Moreover, this mostly had to do with money for Hurricane Sandy, which didn\u2019t even come close to Louisiana.)\n\nFor the purpose of this fact check, we will examine the claim that the Koch brothers have an agenda of protecting \u201ctax cuts for companies that ship our jobs overseas.\u201d That\u2019s a new one.\n\nIn 2012, in a procedural vote, Senate Republicans blocked a bill called the Bring Jobs Home Act, which would have created a new tax credit for companies that return jobs to the United States. It also would have eliminated a standard corporate deduction for moving expenses if those expenses turned out to stem from moving jobs overseas. Somehow, in the ad, this is wrongly translated into \u201ctax cuts\u201d for sending jobs overseas. But let\u2019s put that to the side for the moment.\n\nThat same year, ATR raised $30.9 million for its 501(c)(4). In other words, the Koch contribution was about 1 percent \u2014 a pittance in that year. (Matsdorf notes that in 2010, about 30 percent of the ATR revenue came from Koch entities, but the vote in question was in 2012.)\n\nMatsdorf also pointed to a Washington Post article and graphic that depicted ATR as part of a \u201cKoch network.\u201d But the group is located on the fringes of that network, along with other Republican-leaning groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as \u201coutside allies.\u201d\n\nIn any case, what does ATR have to do with the Bring Jobs Home Act? Matsdorf cites the fact that ATR has a taxpayer pledge for candidates to \u201coppose any and all tax increases\u201d and that ATR once ran a fact check blog post on an Obama speech that said that \u201ccompanies don\u2019t get tax breaks for moving anything overseas.\u201d (One can argue over semantics, but Obama has a tendency to suggest this is a special loophole. Instead, it\u2019s a standard moving expense deduction that is part of the tax code, whether you are moving jobs to Vienna, Va., or Vienna, Austria.)\n\nBut we could find no evidence that ATR ever took a position on this bill, which after all is supposedly the reason that Senate Majority PAC says saving this \u201ctax cut\u201d is a central part of the Koch agenda. Indeed, Ryan Ellis, ATR\u2019s policy director, told The Fact Checker: \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that bill, so I can tell you with some confidence that we don\u2019t have a position on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe advocate for a tax system that does not have carve-outs for anyone \u2014 a direct contrast to the assertion in the ad,\u201d said Melissa Cohlmia, a spokeswoman for Koch Industries. She added that the company has never lobbied on moving deductions.\n\nUpon examination, this claim crumbles into dust. The ad not only mischaracterizes an ordinary tax deduction as a special \u201ctax cut\u201d but then it falsely asserts that \u201cprotecting\u201d this tax break is part of the Koch agenda. It turns out this claim is based on a tenuous link to an organization that never even took a position on the legislation in question.", "lang": "en"}
