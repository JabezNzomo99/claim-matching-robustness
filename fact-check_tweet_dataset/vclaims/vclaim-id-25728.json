A caption along the video claims that it shows Indian Independence Day celebrations at Trafalgar Square in London. This claim is false; the video shows neither Indian Independence Day nor Trafalgar Square in London. It actually shows Italian Republic Day celebrations in Rome.\n\nA 45-second video was published in this Twitter post on August 17, 2019, and has since been viewed 1,000 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states:\n\n \u201cRequest everyone to watch this 1 minute video without miss.\n\n This is an amazing forward from Trafalgar square, London during the celebration of India\u2019s Independence Day.Jai Hind\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nA slightly longer video of 55 seconds showing the same visuals and making a similar claim is also circulating on Facebook here and here.\n\nThe same video was published on YouTube on August 16, 2019 -- just a day after India marked its annual Independence Day celebrations -- with similar claims here and here.\n\nBut the video shows neither Indian Independence Day celebrations nor a view of London\u2019s Trafalgar Square.\n\nThe building shown in the video is the Vittorio Emmanuelle II Monument, also known as the Altar of the Fatherland (\u201cAltare della Patria\u201d in Italian). It is located in central Rome\u2019s Piazza Venezia and is one of the Italian capital\u2019s most famous buildings.\n\nBelow is a comparison of a screenshot from the misleading video (L) and a photo taken at the same location in Italy by AFP photographer Andreas Solaro (R):\n\nRepublic Day is celebrated in Italy on June 2 every year, marking the day in 1946 when the country voted to abolish its constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe Italian Air Force\u2019s Frecce Tricolori air squad performs a ceremony marking Italian Republic Day on June 2 every year. Their jet planes fly over the Altare della Patria monument in Piazza Venezia, leaving a trail of green, white and red smoke in the sky.\n\nBelow is a video posted on June 2, 2019 by the verified account of the Italian Air Force showing the ceremony on Italian Republic Day this year:\n\nA picture from the same social media account shows the same ceremony from an earlier date:\n\nBelow is a comparison of a screenshot from the misleading video (L) and the picture posted by the Italian Air Force:", "lang": "en"}
