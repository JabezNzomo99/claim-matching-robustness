The claim is false; the photo was taken in 2018 during a procession on Ashura, a Muslim holy day.\n\nThe photo was published in this Facebook post on May 15, 2020. It has been shared more than 3,600 times.\n\nThe photo shows Syed Murad Ali Shah (circled in white), chief minister of the southern Pakistani province of Sindh, attending a rally.\n\nThe post's Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThere is coronavirus in the mosques, but there is no coronavirus here? Have some shame.\u201d\n\nThe photo circulated online on May 15, 2020, the 21st day of the holy month Ramadan when Muslims commemorate Youm-e-Shahadat Ali, or Youm-e-Ali, the martyrdom anniversary of the fourth caliph Ali.\n\nThe misleading post accuses Shah of breaking a social restriction order his government imposed on the province of Sindh during the COVID-19 pandemic by attending a memorial rally for Ali.\n\nThe photo has been shared on Facebook with a similar claim here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo was taken in 2018 on Ashura, a Muslim holy day.\n\nA reverse image search found the photo published here on the Twitter account of the Sindh chief minister in September 2018.\n\nThe tweet states: \u201cKarachi: (September 21st, 2018): Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah leads the procession of 10th Muharram ul Haram Julos in Karachi.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the Sindh chief minister\u2019s tweet (R):\n\nThe photograph was also published here alongside an identical caption on the website for the Sindh government\u2019s Information & Archives Department.\n\nThe Urdu-language banner in the background of the photo translates to English as: \u201cToday is the day of martyrdom of Imam Hussein.\u201d\n\nHussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, is commemorated annually on Ashura, which is the 10th day of the first month in the Islamic calendar, or Moharram.\n\nIn 2018, Ashura fell on September 21, which corresponds with the publishing date of the photo of Shah.\n\nDespite the Sindh government\u2019s ban on mass prayers and public processions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 200 people attended processions to mark Youm-e-Ali on May 15, 2020, Pakistani newspaper The Express Tribune reported here.\n\nBelow is an image of the Sindh government's notification banning religious gatherings, processions and mass prayers issued on April 27, 2020. The notification was circulated by the government among local reporters in Karachi via WhatsApp.\n\nShah did not take part in any Youm-e-Ali processions in May 2020, according to his spokesman Rasheed Channa.\n\n\u201cChief minister Murad Ali Shah did not take part in the Youm-e-Ali (martyrdom anniversary of Ali) procession this year. It is an old pic which is wrongly attributed to his visit to the procession,\u201d Channa told AFP by phone on June 1, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
