Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The idea was to fund children\u2019s health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address but then backed off when it appeared that the concept would imperil budget talks with Republicans. With urging from the president, a Senate vote in May doomed the plan.\n\nBut Kennedy would not give up and within weeks was trying again to pass a revised version of CHIP. An August 1997 New York Times article on final passage of the bill reported that \u201cparticipants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the First Lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support. But Mr. Clinton did not appear to move on the issue until a meeting at the White House on July 22 with an agitated Mr. Kennedy.\u201d\n\nThe effort was revived, with Kennedy, Hatch and a coalition of advocacy groups ranging from the Children\u2019s Defense Fund to the Girl Scouts lobbying hard. Kennedy made a special appeal to the first lady, who added her pressure anew.\n\n \u201cThe children\u2019s health program wouldn\u2019t be in existence today if we didn\u2019t have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,\u201d Kennedy told The Associated Press.\n\n President Clinton signed the bill in August 1997.\n\n While Kennedy is widely viewed as the driving force behind the program, by all accounts the former first lady\u2019s pressure was crucial.\n\n \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a legislator, she didn\u2019t write the law, and she wasn\u2019t the president, so she didn\u2019t make the decisions,\u201d says Nick Littlefield, then a senior health adviser to Kennedy. \u201cBut we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton, who has frequently described herself on the campaign trail as playing a pivotal role in forging a children\u2019s health insurance plan, had little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue\u2026.\n\n The Clinton White House, while supportive of the idea of expanding children\u2019s health, fought the first SCHIP effort, spearheaded by Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, because of fears that it would derail a bigger budget bill. And several current and former lawmakers and staff said Hillary Clinton had no role in helping to write the congressional legislation, which grew out of a similar program approved in Massachusetts in 1996.\n\n \u201cThe White House wasn\u2019t for it. We really roughed them up\u201d in trying to get it approved over the Clinton administration\u2019s objections, Hatch said in an interview. \u201cShe may have done some advocacy [privately] over at the White House, but I\u2019m not aware of it.\u201d\n\nDuring months of SCHIP negotiations in 1997, her name rarely surfaced in news accounts. Clinton never testified before Congress or held a news conference on the bill.\n\n When Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), the lead GOP negotiator of the children\u2019s health bill, heard reports that Clinton was depicting herself as SCHIP\u2019s main advocate, \u201cI had to blink a few times,\u201d he said. Hatch said he doesn\u2019t recall a single conversation with Clinton about SCHIP, even a mention of her name. \u201cIf she was involved, I didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d he said.\n\n \u201cYou know how she says, \u2018I started SCHIP\u2019? Well, so did I,\u201d joked Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), one of the Democrats who pushed the bill across the finish line along with Kennedy. Both have endorsed Obama.\n\n Some Clinton insiders also are uncomfortable with some of her assertions. \u201cI don\u2019t really like the way she talks about her role in SCHIP,\u201d conceded one former Clinton administration official, who supports the first lady\u2019s candidacy, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to express his views candidly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t say it right. What she should say is \u2018I was the driving force in the administration.\u2019 That\u2019s pretty big, and it\u2019s all true.\u201d\u2026\n\n Last fall, Kennedy said SCHIP \u201cwouldn\u2019t be in existence\u201d without Clinton\u2019s support inside the White House. But when her rhetoric on the campaign trail started to filter back to the Capitol, the veteran legislator became stingier with his praise.\n\n \u201cAt the last hour, the administration supported it, and she was part of the administration, so I suppose she could say she supported it at the time,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nThere were two approaches to creating legislation to covering low-income children \u2013 one was the Kennedy-Hatch bill that was a grant program and the other was the Chafee-Rockefeller bill that expanded the Medicaid program. The final bill was a compromise between the two bills. At that time, the Republican Leadership in the House and Senate were opposed to additional funding for children\u2019s health care \u2014 had it not been for the strong support of the White House and First Lady for funding children\u2019s health, the SCHIP bill would never have been included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The SCHIP bill was ultimately passed out of the Finance Committee under the leadership of Finance Committee members, Senators Chafee and Rockefeller, and there were many conversations behind the scenes with staff in the White House and the First Lady\u2019s office on the path to achieving that goal.\n\nBut in reviewing the contemporaneous news reporting and later fact checks, we can find no evidence that she \u201cworked with Democrats and Republicans\u201d to create the law. Instead, she worked internally with White House staff and with Kennedy\u2019s office; by Hatch\u2019s account, she had no dealings with him, even though he was the key Republican moving the bill. Moreover, Clinton was certainly not involved in the details of the crafting the legislative language. The bill was a bipartisan effort, but her role was limited to being a largely hidden cheerleader at the White House, rather than a public advocate who directly worked with lawmakers in both parties. She emerged more visibly as a promoter of the law after it was enacted.", "lang": "en"}
