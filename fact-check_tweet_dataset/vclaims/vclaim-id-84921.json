Look, we have serious economic problems in many parts of our country. And Roland is absolutely right. Instead of dividing people the way Donald Trump does, let\u2019s reunite around policies that will bring jobs and opportunities to all these underserved poor communities. So for example, I\u2019m the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country. Because we\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right, Tim? And we\u2019re going to make it clear that we don\u2019t want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now we\u2019ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don\u2019t want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on. So whether it\u2019s coal country or Indian country or poor urban areas, there is a lot of poverty in America. We have gone backwards. We were moving in the right direction. In the \u201990s more people were lifted out of poverty than anytime in recent history. Because of the terrible economic policies of the Bush administration, President Obama was left with the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and people fell back into poverty because they lost jobs, they lost homes, they lost opportunities, and hope. So I am passionate about this, which is why I have put forward specific plans about how we incentivize more jobs, more investment in poor communities, and put people to work.", "lang": "en"}
