While it\u2019s clear enrollment has declined by millions, there are some caveats to the president\u2019s number.\n\nDue to overlap in participation and other factors, it\u2019s unclear whether the figure is exactly correct. The bulk of the 10 million comes from a drop in food stamp recipients, a figure that has been declining since 2013, expectedly so, as the economy has improved. Other conditions may have played a role in the decline in Medicaid coverage.\n\nThe president made this claim in his State of the Union address in early February and has repeated it several times since in campaign rallies, often mentioning food stamps, formally called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. When we reached out to his campaign, it pointed also to figures on enrollment in Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (the cash-assistance program most often referred to as \u201cwelfare\u201d), and the Supplemental Security Income program for disabled adults and children.\n\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers reports have pointed not to SSI but rather Social Security Disability Insurance, another program for disabled adults who are unable to work. A Feb. 20 CEA fact sheet on the White House website, for instance, talks about the job market and income growth \u201cpulling people out of poverty and off means-tested welfare programs.\u201d It goes on to provide some numbers: \u201cFood insecurity has fallen, and there are nearly 7 million fewer people participating in SNAP than there were at the time of the 2016 election. The caseload for TANF has fallen by more than 900,000 individuals, and the number of individuals on Social Security Disability Insurance has fallen by almost 400,000 since the 2016 election. Similarly, Medicaid & CHIP enrollment reported by States is down by 3 million.\u201d\n\nThe SNAP figure is actually closer to 5 million, but the other figures are largely correct. Either way, one can get to nearly 10 million with SNAP, TANF and Medicaid/CHIP. However, because of overlap between the enrollments in the programs, it\u2019s not clear how many individual \u201cpeople,\u201d as Trump has put it, have left these programs during his administration.\n\nIt\u2019s even possible the true number of individuals is higher, because what the monthly enrollment figures show are that more people are leaving the programs than joining them. Trump would be on firmer factual ground to say 10 million is the change in average monthly enrollment in these programs under his administration.\n\nPerhaps a more important caveat is the trend in most of these programs predates the president\u2019s time in office. Enrollment is generally supposed to drop in most of these programs when unemployment is low and the economy is doing well \u2014 and the figures should grow during an economic recession.\n\nBack in 2017, when Trump promised to lift \u201cmillions\u201d off welfare, we noted that the welfare rolls, meaning TANF, had already declined by millions \u2014 from 10.9 million average monthly recipients in fiscal 1997 to 2.8 million in fiscal 2016, a reduction sparked by 1996 legislation signed by then-President Bill Clinton to put work requirements and time limits on TANF.\n\nBut if he were including SNAP and other programs as \u201cwelfare\u201d then, the promise wouldn\u2019t have meant much.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at these programs and the trends over time.\n\nThe president often specifically mentions food stamps, or SNAP, saying as he did on March 2 at a rally in North Carolina: \u201cWe have lifted 10 million people off of welfare, including 7 million people off of food stamps.\u201d But that figure is inflated, and the issue involves the state in which he was speaking.\n\nThe official U.S. Department of Agriculture figures on SNAP appear to show the national monthly number has declined by 6.5 million since Trump took office in January 2017. However, all months after fiscal 2017 don\u2019t include data from North Carolina, as the USDA table notes. The true figure is closer to a 5 million decline.\n\nNorth Carolina does provide figures on a state website, and those show nearly 1.3 million people participated in the state program in November 2019, the latest month for which USDA has national figures. So, adding North Carolina back into the latest U.S. statistics, would put the decline in enrollment under Trump at 5.2 million.\n\nThe economy is \u201cthe biggest factor in SNAP\u201d enrollment, Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior fellow with the liberal-learning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told us in an interview. While there could be other reasons the numbers move, such as policy choices in individual states, it\u2019s mainly about the economy and poverty levels.\n\n\u201cTrends in SNAP caseloads follow trends in poverty,\u201d Rosenbaum, whose research focuses on SNAP, said, adding that this trend started before Trump took office and has continued. \u201cThe fact that SNAP has come down shows that it\u2019s working as intended.\u201d\n\nThis chart from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows how enrollment mirrors poverty figures:\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, the number of Americans getting food stamp assistance grew during the Great Recession of 2007-2009 and after, as the stimulus legislation increased benefit levels. Enrollment peaked in December 2012, when 47.8 million individuals participated in the program. But as the economy improved, that figure fell.\n\nBy the time former President Barack Obama left office, the monthly number of people enrolled in SNAP had dropped by 5 million from the December 2012 peak to January 2017, a bit more than four years.\n\nIn nearly three years under Trump \u2014 34 months, given the most recent USDA data \u2014 the enrollment has declined by another 5.2 million.\n\nThe figure may further decline due to factors beyond the economy, such as administration changes to eligibility, but those haven\u2019t yet gone into effect. A USDA rule for tightened requirements on able-bodied adults without dependents is set to go into effect on April 1 and would reduce SNAP eligibility by 688,000 people next fiscal year, according to the USDA analysis.\n\nLast summer, the administration said another proposal could reduce SNAP enrollment by 3 million by limiting state flexibility regarding income and asset levels of recipients.\n\nMedicaid and CHIP enrollment has declined by 3.9 million from Jan. 2017 to Nov. 2019 (the most recent preliminary figures available). But it\u2019s not possible to simply add that figure to the decline in SNAP to get the number of \u201cpeople\u201d who moved off of these programs. There\u2019s substantial overlap in the two programs.\n\nWe don\u2019t know precisely what the overlap is, or whether people who moved off one program since 2017 would have also moved off the other.\n\nIn 2016, the Urban Institute estimated, based on 2013 data \u2014 before the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 that 59% of children, 54% of parents and 23% of nonparents who were eligible for either SNAP or Medicaid/CHIP were also eligible for the other program. That\u2019s eligible, not necessarily enrolled in both. But the ACA would have increased those figures in the 36 states, plus Washington, D.C., that adopted the expansion.\n\nUrban Institute researchers, in a report produced for the Department of Health and Human Services in 2013, found that if all states implemented the expansion, 97% of SNAP recipients and 99% of TANF recipients would be eligible for Medicaid and CHIP.\n\nAgain, not all states expanded Medicaid and not everyone eligible for these programs enrolls in them. As for participation estimates, a 2016 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report said, \u201cAbout three-quarters of households receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps) benefits in 2014 had at least one member receiving health coverage through Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\u201d And the Bureau of Labor Statistics looked at 2014 Census data on families with children under 18 and found 23.7% of those getting government assistance were enrolled in both Medicaid and SNAP.\n\nGenerally, the SNAP income limit for eligibility is 130% of the federal poverty level, CBPP said. Medicaid requirements vary by state, but the limit is 138% for the states that implemented the ACA expansion.\n\nRosenbaum told us in some states, the same agency administers SNAP and Medicaid, making it more likely that those who left one program would have left the other. But it\u2019s hard to know what may have happened in states that administer the programs separately. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to know on an individual level how many fewer people participated,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of this is about the decline in the average monthly number of participants.\u201d\n\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers said the drop in Medicaid participation \u201cis predominantly due to a reduction in the number of Medicaid-eligible individuals because of income growth, not eligibility restrictions.\u201d\n\nSamantha Artiga, director of the Disparities Policy Project at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation and associate director for KFF\u2019s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured, told us that \u201csome\u201d of the drop \u2014 which reverses the trend of growing enrollment after the ACA \u2014 \u201cmay reflect individuals moving to other coverage as a result of increases in income or changes in employment amid the improving economy.\u201d But, she said, some who have left Medicaid/CHIP have likely become uninsured, since \u201csurvey data also show a recent rise in the uninsured rate, driven by decreases in Medicaid and CHIP coverage.\u201d\n\nOther factors may be at play in the Medicaid/CHIP decline.\n\n\u201cExperiences in some states suggest that some eligible people may be losing coverage due to difficulties completing processes or providing information to maintain coverage, for example, if they do not receive or have difficulty understanding notices or information requests from the state,\u201d Artiga said in an email. Also, \u201cthe administration has reduced funds to support outreach and enrollment assistance, which is often an important for getting and keeping eligible families enrolled in coverage. Moreover, a growing body of research indicates that the shifting immigration policy environment, including recent changes to public charge policy, may be deterring some families from enrolling themselves or their children in coverage or continuing coverage at renewal.\u201d\n\nThe administration finalized a new so-called \u201cpublic charge rule\u201d that could deny green card status to legal immigrants who received Medicaid and other federal benefits. A September KFF report estimated the rule, which went into effect on Oct. 15, 2019, could cause 2 million to 4.7 million people to drop out of Medicaid and CHIP.\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence that some, including those not actually affected by the rule change, have withdrawn from the programs. In a 2019 KFF/George Washington University Survey of Community Health Centers, 32% of health centers said \u201cmany or some\u201d patients who were immigrants disenrolled or didn\u2019t renew Medicaid coverage over the previous year, and 28% said patients had done the same for their children. The survey was conducted from May to July last year.\n\nA July 2019 report from CBPP said the economy \u201ccannot explain the full national enrollment decline.\u201d For one, that report found no relationship between changes in enrollment and changes in states\u2019 unemployment rates, concluding that the causes for the Medicaid/CHIP enrollment decline \u201clikely vary across states.\u201d It pointed to the Arkansas work requirements instituted in June 2018 (now blocked by the courts) and \u201cincreased red tape\u201d in other states hindering enrollment.\n\nEnrollment in TANF \u2014 the cash-assistance program typically considered \u201cwelfare\u201d \u2014 has declined by 825,145 from January 2017 to June 2019, the most recent figures available. That includes enrollment in the State Supplemental Program, state cash-assistance that\u2019s based on Supplemental Security Income eligibility.\n\nChildren make up the vast majority of TANF enrollment. In 2018, 74% of recipients were children, according to data in a Dec. 30, 2019, report by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThere\u2019s also substantial overlap between TANF and SNAP: 82% of TANF families also received SNAP, according to fiscal 2018 figures from the administration.\n\nThe CRS report said over the long-term, the economy has affected the caseload of TANF, though other factors, such policy changes, also have played a role. As we mentioned, TANF enrollment has dropped precipitously since 1996 welfare legislation was enacted under the Clinton administration. CRS figures show the number of families enrolled in TANF increased from 2008 to 2010, during and just after the Great Recession, but then began to fall.\n\nThe White House economic advisers\u2019 report includes Social Security Disability Insurance as a \u201cmeans-tested welfare\u201d program, but Kathleen Romig, a senior policy analyst at CBPP, objects to that characterization. \u201cSocial Security Disability Insurance is not a means-tested \u2018welfare\u2019 program at all,\u201d she told FactCheck.org. \u201cLike the rest of Social Security, it is a social insurance program that requires beneficiaries to have substantial work histories, and benefits are based on contributions to the program.\u201d\n\nIn fact, SSDI provides benefits for those unable to work due to a medical condition that lasts more than a year or causes death.\n\nRomig said the administration\u2019s figure of a 400,000 decline since the election was actually too low. The available SSDI statistics online are only current through December 2018. The drop continues a trend that CBPP noted in a January report. The decline in both applications and enrollment since 2010 is partly due to the economy, though other factors are likely at play. The CBPP report included several possibilities, such as paperwork requirements.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service cited several factors in a November 2018 report: demographics (baby boomers reaching full retirement age followed by a smaller cohort of those of typical disability age), added jobs post-recession, the Affordable Care Act, and a smaller share of applications being approved.\n\nOverall, Trump is correct to cite a decline in enrollment in these programs, largely due to economic factors. But such trends, other than with Medicaid, began before he took office, and we can\u2019t say whether his 10 million \u201cpeople\u201d claim is correct. Administration policies to decrease eligibility for SNAP and Medicaid also are expected to begin to have an effect.", "lang": "en"}
