The caption with the image states that the woman shown in the picture has undergone 17 surgeries to resemble like Barbie doll. When Vishvas News investigated we found the viral post is fake. Unlike the claims, the pictures do not show a 68-year-old woman after a number of surgeries. In fact, it is a makeup done by a makeup artist named Luis Baptista and the woman is a model from London Cassie Lloyd.\n\nThe viral post shared on Facebook reads: \u201c68-year-old Florida woman wears\n\n17 operations in 6 years to look like Barbie doll. Only if it\u2019s Barbie From the fifths of hell.\u201d Some photographs are also shared showing a woman with disfigured facial features. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News performed Google reverse image search of the viral photos and found that the images are viral since May 2019.\n\nWe further investigated and found an Instagram post by an artist named Luis Baptista. The artist created the artwork for the character \u2018Weirdo Helena\u2019 as an illustration to inform people of the dangers and issues of the beauty industry. The model in the post is Cassie Lloyd.\n\nThe Instagram post was uploaded on May 21, 2019, and the post is going viral with different claims since then. Here is the Instagram post:\n\nLuis Baptista, the makeup artist, also shared an Instagram video showing the making of the character. Here\u2019s the video:\n\nVishvas News contacted Luis Baptista and asked him about the viral post. He said: \u201cThe viral post is doing rounds with a false caption. This is an artwork and he did the makeup of the model shown in the image.\u201d\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named John Jackson. When Vishvas News investigated we found that the user is based out of Australia.\n\nConclusion: The woman shown in the viral post didn\u2019t undergo 17 surgeries to resemble Barbie doll. The woman is a model and an artist did her makeup for an illustration.", "lang": "en"}
