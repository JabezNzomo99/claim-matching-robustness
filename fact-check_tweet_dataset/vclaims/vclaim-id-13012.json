Would it?", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-13012", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-membership-spain-scotland/", "vclaim": "We\u2019ve done some Googling so you don\u2019t have to. Long story short: Ms Cherry has a point.\n\nThe independence movement in Catalonia, a region of Spain, means that Madrid doesn\u2019t like encouraging nationalist movements in other countries. That\u2019s why it\u2019s often assumed that the Spanish government is committed to vetoing an independent Scotland\u2019s EU membership.\n\nBut there\u2019s a possible misunderstanding here. There\u2019s a difference between staying in the EU and rejoining it.\n\nEssentially, Spain says that Scotland would have to exit the EU in the event of an independence vote, and then apply to join as a new member. (That\u2019s also what the central EU bodies say.)\n\n\u201cWere Scotland to become independent... the country would be treated as a third state and would have to get in line to join the EU.\u201d That\u2019s from Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, summarising the position taken by the country\u2019s foreign minister this week.\n\nThat\u2019s not, however, a threat to veto an independent Scotland\u2019s membership application. Spain\u2019s Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, refused to get into that when pressed on it shortly after the referendum last summer. Various analysts say that Mr Rajoy would cross that bridge when he comes to it.\n\nAnd other senior figures in Spain are positively ruling out a knee-jerk veto. Ms Cherry mentioned Esteban Pons, a Member of the European Parliament representing Spain\u2019s ruling party. Asked about a Spanish veto last week, he told the BBC:\n\n\u201cNo because if you are thinking about Catalonia the situation is very very very different to the Scottish situation.\"\n\nOther political figures in Spain say the same: while Spain wouldn\u2019t allow Scotland to simply remain in, an application to rejoin would be considered.\n\nTwo final things: Mr Rajoy leads a minority administration. A new Spanish government might have a different policy.\n\nAnd we should note that there\u2019s no \u201cqueue\u201d or \u201cline\u201d for entering the EU as such. An independent Scotland could in theory join ahead of countries like Serbia that are in negotiations at the moment, if the process went smoothly. Iceland overtook Turkey when both were negotiating at the same time.", "lang": "en"}
