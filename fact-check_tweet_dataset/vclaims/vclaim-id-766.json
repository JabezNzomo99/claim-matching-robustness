That assertion was misleading, as agricultural regulations are commonly attached to budget bills. (A Google search reveals myriad examples of this legislative process over the years.)\n\nThe repealed provisions hadn\u2019t been in place all that long. While some had roots in the above-linked 2002 Farm Bill, many only dated to 2009:\n\nOn January 15, 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural Marketing Service published a final rule, which became effective on March 16, 2009 (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, 2009b). Commodities covered in this MCOOL final rule include muscle cuts of beef, chicken, pork, and several other species and products (Link, 2009). Processed meat products, meat purchased at restaurants, and certain commodity meats (e.g., turkey) are exempt from MCOOL (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, 2009a). Examples of the MCOOL labels now appearing on covered meat products include \u201cProduct of the U.S.;\u201d \u201cProduct of Canada;\u201d and \u201cProduct of the U.S., Canada, Mexico.\u201d\n\nNeither meme explained why COOL provisions were repealed to begin with. A Food Safety News article from 21 December 2015 titled \u201cUSDA Ends COOL Enforcement With President\u2019s Signature on Omnibus Bill\u201d reported that the bill was intended to address broader trade concerns:\n\nOn 18 December 2015, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a press release titled \u201cStatement from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on the Country of Origin Labeling Requirements for Beef and Pork,\u201d which confirmed the effects of the bill:\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today released the following statement regarding the language in the omnibus bill repealing the country of origin labeling requirements for beef and pork products. \u201cThe omnibus bill repealed the country of origin labeling (COOL) requirements for muscle cuts of beef and pork, and ground beef and pork. Effective immediately, USDA is not enforcing the COOL requirements for muscle cut and ground beef and pork outlined in the January 2009 and May 2013 final rules.\u201d USDA will be amending the COOL regulations as expeditiously as possible to reflect the repeal of the beef and pork provisions. In addition, all imported and domestic meat will continue to be subject to rigorous inspections by USDA to ensure food safety.\n\nAs Vilsack\u2019s statement explained, the previous country of origin labeling regulations were of debatable value to consumers. Regardless of a meat\u2019s country of origin, all meat sold inside the United States is subject to the same USDA regulations and standards as before.\n\nIn short, it is true that mandatory COOL labeling was officially repealed in the U.S. in late December 2015, but those revised labeling requirements applied only to some meats and had no effect on the required certifications for meat sold in the U.S. (whatever its source). Attachment of the bill to omnibus spending legislation wasn\u2019t sneaky, as USDA provisions are generally passed as part of budget bills for upcoming fiscal years. Finally, nothing about the COOL repeal prevents manufacturers from labeling meat: those vendors who wish to do so are free to label their meats without penalty.", "lang": "en"}
