The claim, however, is false. The image has been digitally manipulated to insert the Indian flag.\n\nThe image was published on Instagram here by Kirron Kher, a prominent lawmaker in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nTricolour is a common reference to the Indian flag, which consists of three different colours, and Jai Hind is a Hindi slogan that translates as: \u201cVictory to India\u201d.\n\nLal Chowk is a public square in Srinagar that has long been a site for political demonstrations, including flag hoistings, in the disputed region.\n\nThe image was also shared alongside similar claims and Independence Day messages on Facebook here, here and here; and on Instagram here, here and here.\n\nOther Indian politicians published the image on social media here, here and here.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex led to evidence showing that the image has been doctored.\n\nThe original photo, which does not contain an Indian flag, was published in July 2010 by an Indian journalist in this blog.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image shared on Facebook (L) and the original 2010 photo (R) with identical features marked A, B and C:\n\nAn AFP stringer in Srinagar, Syed Shahriyar, also confirmed that no India flag was raised in Lal Chowk on August 15, 2020.\n\nShahriyar captured the below photo on the morning of that day:\n\nA local media outlet also published this video on Facebook on August 15, 2020, which shows Lal Chowk deserted. The caption reads: \u201c15 August: Kashmir capital Srinagar.\u201d\n\nGetty Images published another photo here showing no Indian flag over Lal Chowk on August 15, 2020.\n\nIn addition, several other Facebook users shared the manipulated image alongside an old photo of the Pakistani flag hoisted over Lal Chowk. Example posts can be seen here, here and here.\n\nWhile the image of the Indian flag flying over Lal Chowk is fake, the photo of the hoisted Pakistani flag appears to be authentic and show a political demonstration in 2010.\n\nThe photo corresponds to the AFP photo below, which is captioned: \u201cKashmiri protestors hoisting a flag on to a clock tower in Srinagar on September 11, 2010.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
