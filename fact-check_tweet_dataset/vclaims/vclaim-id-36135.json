The final list of the NRC was recently released, and over 19 lakh people from Assam failed to make the cut.\n\nThe above tweet is by a Pakistani social media user and has been retweeted over 750 times since it was posted on September 2. The video clip is 45 seconds long, and shows a scuffle taking place between men in police uniforms and men in military fatigues. It has also been posted and shared on Facebook by a page, Apna Pakistan.\n\nThe video clip has a logo of Hindi TV news channel News Nation on the top left corner. Moreover, at 37 seconds in the video, a man can be heard saying, \u201cDelhi mein kya hua?\u201d (What happened in Delhi?- translation). On the basis of these clues and with the use of specific key words, Alt News managed to find the same video clip on the website of News Nation. The incident is of February, 2018.\n\nAccording to reports, a clash had erupted on February 26, 2018 between army personnel and Delhi police near the Delhi cantonment area, when a Delhi police constable entered a restricted area, allegedly in an inebriated state. Army personnel had claimed that the cop was drunk, and that he misbehaved with a senior army officer present there. Delhi police meanwhile had rubbished the claim, although a probe into the same was ordered.\n\nAn old video of February 2018 depicting a clash between army and police personnel in Delhi, was falsely shared as unrest in Assam over the NRC.", "lang": "en"}
