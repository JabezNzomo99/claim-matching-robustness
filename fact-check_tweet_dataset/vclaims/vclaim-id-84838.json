But because superdelegates make up 15 percent of the total delegate pool, neither Clinton nor Bernie Sanders can obtain the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination without the support of a good chunk of these superdelegates.\n\nSince any superdelegate can change their vote up until the convention, that gives the Sanders campaign hope that it can sway enough minds by July 25, when the convention begins, even if Sanders lags in the pledged delegate count.\n\nOn the Sanders list, one major oddity is that it includes 23 members of the New York congressional delegation. These lawmakers were among Clinton\u2019s earliest and strongest supporters in 2008, and they adamantly refused to switch as long as she remained in the race. But on June 8, one day after Clinton dropped out, the entire New York congressional delegation collectively endorsed Obama.\n\nIn a news article on Clinton releasing her delegates, then-New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine is quoted as saying the New Jersey delegation privately decided to switch to Obama in light of her decision to release her delegates. There are nine members of the New Jersey congressional delegation on the Sanders list \u2014 including Corzine. \u201cI think it is reflective of the unity that I sense that is building across the party,\u201d Corzine told USA Today.\n\nThis list shows 29 people switched from Clinton to Obama, though one later switched back to Clinton. That\u2019s a total of 28. Some of these switches were undoubtedly noteworthy and symbolic, such as the announcement by civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis of Georgia on Feb. 14. But 18, including former vice president Walter Mondale, switched after the last primaries in South Dakota and Montana \u2014 and the same week Clinton dropped out. So it\u2019s really just 10 people during the primary season.\n\nIn 2008, as of March 4, Obama had the support of 199 superdelegates and Clinton had 247. At that point in the race, Obama began to pull away from Clinton in terms of the number of pledged delegates he had won in primaries and caucuses.\n\nWhen Obama edged ahead with more pledged delegates, that\u2019s also when Clinton\u2019s superdelegate count began to stall and Obama began to pick up more superdelegates. Most of these were not party officials who switched sides but people who had been on the fence, waiting to see who appeared likely to win the nomination. (In fact, only six people switched sides before Obama had accumulated more superdelegates than Clinton.)\n\nBy the beginning of May, Obama had won the support of more superdelegates than Clinton. By June, it had turned into a rout, with Obama attracting the support of 394.5 superdelegates and Clinton ending up with 280, according to a New York Times graphic. Superdelegates who switched constituted only 7 percent of Obama\u2019s superdelegate tally.\n\nBy contrast, according to the Associated Press, Clinton, as of May 4 this year, has 522 superdelegates compared to 39 for Sanders. Clinton is just 178 delegates short of victory, meaning far more than 116 superdelegates would need to switch from Clinton to Sanders to make a difference in the outcome.\n\nJust since March 31, Clinton has added 51 superdelegates, compared to eight for Sanders. She also has maintained a healthy lead of about 300 pledged delegates \u2014 far more than what Obama ever achieved during the tight 2008 contest. Indeed, senior Sanders adviser Tad Devine in early May told our colleague Greg Sargent that unless Sanders \u201csignificantly\u201d closes the current pledged delegate gap with Clinton, it will be borderline \u201cimpossible\u201d to persuade superdelegates to switch from Clinton to Sanders.\n\nWeaver cast the 120 figure as happening \u201cin the course of 2008\u201d and said it demonstrated \u201ca lot of movement\u201d in allegiance to the two candidates. But the record shows the opposite. Just 10 people switched from Clinton to Obama before the last primary votes were cast. The number grows to 28 if you include people who switched just before Clinton dropped out on June 7.", "lang": "en"}
