It is being claimed that Indian Air Force planes are painting the sky with the colours of our national flag.\n\nThe video was shared on May 3, 2020, when Indian armed forces saluted Corona warriors by spraying flowers from planes and lighting up warships and showed their gratitude towards healthcare personnel and other people who are in the frontline.\n\nThe caption of the post read: \u201c\u0906\u0915\u093e\u0936 \u0938\u0947 \u0932\u0947\u0915\u0930 \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0924\u0915 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0940 \u0939\u0940 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0940\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\n\n \u091c\u092f \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3, \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\u201d\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the claim to be false.\n\nOn putting the keyframes of the video through Reverse Image Search, we came across a tweet by the Italian Air force dated March 12, 2020, featuring the same video.\n\n\u201cUnity and teamwork have always been the principles on which our Armed Force is based and, at this moment more than ever, are fundamental.
