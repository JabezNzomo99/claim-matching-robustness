Here is an image of a Kavi Sammelan on August 14, 2017.\n\n\u201cAre they Pakistanis\u201d asks Hegde who is unable to recognize the colors of the Indian flag. He is also unaware that Jashn-e-Azadi means celebration of independence.\n\nIn his haste to implicate Mamata Banerjee led TMC and the minority community, Hegde has also forgotten that the President of India addresses the nation on August 14 every year. Only the absolutely ignorant or those with a sinister agenda will conclude that an event on the eve of Independence Day means a celebration of Pakistan\u2019s Independence Day.\n\nSeveral like-minded right-wing handles have tweeted the image from West Bengal and raised similar questions. They are either ignorant of the celebration of Indian Independence Day or are deliberately fanning a divisive agenda.\n\nThe Jashn-e-Azadi All India Mushaira in Titagarh that Hegde and others are trying to malign features poet Imran Pratapgarhi and was organized in 2017 as well. Other than poetry recitation, it also features the hoisting of the Indian flag. A tweet from the poet elaborates on the program planned for this year.\n\nIt is unfortunate that while Indians are gearing up to celebrate the Independence Day with pride, there are those who are spreading misinformation and peddling a divisive agenda. Hegde who is also the founder of the fake news website Postcard News is a repeat offender and has been caught in controversies several times in the past. Social media users users must verify before trusting information originating from such handles.", "lang": "en"}
