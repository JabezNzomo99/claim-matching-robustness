A verified account named Ashok Pandit has shared a video on Twitter in which Sonia Gandhi can be seen shaking hands with some people. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also present in this video with Sonia Gandhi. According to the caption, this video was shot when Manmohan was the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi is insulting the dignity of the Prime Minister by sidelining him during a meeting with Sri lankan PM. Actually, this video is from 2017 when Manmohan Singh was not the Prime Minister of India. The description written with this video is completely misleading.\n\nThe video shows Sonia Gandhi meeting with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. In the video, Dr Manmohan Singh can be seen following Sonia Gandhi. Sonia Gandhi is sitting in front of Sri Lankan Prime Minister, while Manmohan is sitting by her side. The video caption says, \u201cOnce during Prime Ministership of #DrManMohanSingh, Srilankan PM came to India on diplomatic visit. Kindly watch this \ud83d\udc46video. Rest is left to your observation skills. (no politics behind)\ud83d\ude4f Good Night..\u201d\n\nTo begin our investigation, we first took the keyframes of this video and reverse image searched it on Google. We wrote keywords \u2018Sonia Gandhi Meets Sri Lankan Prime Minister\u2019. In this video NNIC can be seen written in the extreme right corner, hence we used NNIC also as a keyword. We were able to find this video on Youtube. This video was posted in 2017 by a YouTube channel called NNIS News, and the video\u2019s description was \u201cOn his four-day visit to India, Sri Lanka Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe met opposition party leader Sonia Gandhi and former Indian PM Dr. Manmohan Singh\u201d.\n\nWe searched Google news and found that Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe came to India in 2017 and met Sonia Gandhi on the sidelines of his visit.\n\nIt is important for us to tell you that Sonia Gandhi was the President of Congress Party at the time of this meeting. In December 2017, she handed over her position to her son Rahul Gandhi.\n\nThe concerned video has been shared on many other social media pages as well.\n\nLet us tell you that Ashok Pandit is a famous Indian film producer and a social worker. He is currently the President of IFTDA (Indian Film and Television Director\u2019s Association). Ironically, Ashok Pandit was also the co-producer of the film \u2018The Accidental Prime Minister\u2019. His Twitter account is verified.\n\nConclusion: In our investigation, we found that the description of this video shared by Ashok Pandit is misleading. While shooting this video, Manmohan Singh was not the Prime Minister of the country.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
