Others appeared skeptical because the clip was reminiscent of the animated movie \u201cTurbo,\u201d a film about a small snail with a big dream of moving fast:\n\nWhile this clip may appear to be taken straight from a cute animated flick, this is a real video of a snail captured during an auto race. This video was first posted to the YouTube page of World Rally Championship (WRC) Paraguay driver Victor Lopez in May 2019, and the original clip (which can be viewed below) contains about 10 extra seconds of footage:\n\nWhile this video appears to be authentic (the WRC Rally Paraguay Victor L\u00f3pez YouTube page doesn\u2019t seem to dabble in online trickery), what exactly it shows is open to interpretation.\n\nWe doubt that this snail was actually \u201cwatching\u201d this car drift around the bend. While snails do have eyes (attached to two tentacles protruding from their heads), their sense of sight isn\u2019t particularly adept, as Snail-world.com writes:\n\nThe sense of sight of snails is useful but only detect changes in the intensity of light to recognize whether it is night or day. They can move their tentacles up or down to improve their ability to see. However, they are practically deaf since they have no ears nor ear canal. To compensate this absence of hearing they have an excellent associative thought which helps them remember the places where they were or where the objects of their surroundings are.\n\nRobert Nordsieck, author of The Living World of Molluscs website, notes that a snails\u2019 sense of sight varies depending on the species. Generally speaking, however, snails have cup-shaped eyes that function like a pinhole camera, giving snails the ability to see light and dark, but they aren\u2019t great at distinguishing sizes and shapes:\n\nHow a cup-shaped eye is constructed clearly limits its visual abilities. Cup shaped eyes can only tell the difference between light and dark and also they can see where the light comes from. But they cannot distinguish forms and they can certainly not see any pictures.\n\nThe following image comparison from London\u2019s Natural History Museum shows the difference between how humans and common garden snails see the world:\n\nIn sum, this is a genuine clip of a snail at the side of an auto race, but we\u2019re not convinced the snail was actually \u201cwatching\u201d the race. If the snail truly saw this car drifting around a turn, it\u2019s unlikely the critter knew what it was seeing. It\u2019s also possible that this snail was oblivious to the HRC race taking place just over this ridge, and that the video merely shows the snail reacting to vibrations or engaging in a coincidental movement at the moment a car zoomed by below.", "lang": "en"}
