The claim is misleading; the World Health Organization (WHO) says drinking water does not prevent novel coronavirus infection; Japan has not issued a health advisory listing drinking water as a prevention method for COVID-19.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on February 28, 2020.\n\nIt has been shared more than 400 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post reads, in part: \"SERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.

Once there in tummy...your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly...the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That's very dangerous.\"\n\nA similar claim was also shared here and here on Twitter.\n\nThis tweet on the WHO's official Twitter account states in part: \"While staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.\"\n\nALSO READ: 5 Things To Know About Coronavirus Symptoms, Important Numbers And Vaccines\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the WHO's tweet:\n\nThis video produced by the WHO gives advice on how to prevent coronavirus infection.\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which oversees the country's response to the novel coronavirus, has also not issued an advisory recommending frequent water intake.\n\nIn the \"About Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\" section of its website, the ministry lists washing hands frequently and covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing as \"everyday preventive actions\" to take.\n\nALSO READ: US Radio Host Rush Limbaugh Falsely Likens COVID-19 To Common Cold\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant section of the website:\n\nThere is no mention of frequent water intake in any of the advisories it has issued.
