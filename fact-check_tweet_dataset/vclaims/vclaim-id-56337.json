In the weeks that followed, a number of social media users complained that the company was erasing the accomplishments of Nancy Green, the woman who portrayed the character around the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nMany commenters claimed that Green had become a millionaire from her work (false) and illustrated their messages with an image of a smiling Aunt Jemima holding a stack of pancakes:\n\nWe covered the history of the Aunt Jemima persona and Green\u2019s involvement in another article.\n\nIn short, there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that Green became conspicuously wealthy from her work portraying Aunt Jemima. As for the above-displayed photograph, this image does not show Aunt Jemima (nor any of the women who played her in an official capacity). Furthermore, this image has been cropped. In the original photograph you can see shackles around the model\u2019s ankle:\n\nThis is a modern day artist\u2019s interpretation of the Aunt Jemima character. This photograph was taken by Sally Stockhold in 2008 and was titled, \u201cAunt Jemima: I Laughed Because They Paid Me.\u201d\n\nThe image is included in a collection of self-portraits published on Stockhold\u2019s website and labeled \u201cmyselfportraits ode to icons and other absurdities.\u201d\n\nIn other words, this is not a historical image of Green nor any woman who portrayed the fictional persona of Aunt Jemima in the early 1900s. This photograph actually shows a white woman in blackface depicting the character of Aunt Jemima as a slave to the brand.\n\nRead more about Green and the history of the Aunt Jemima character here.", "lang": "en"}
