Fleeing Hindus, helpless cops, and burning houses, if you haven't seen Kashmir, see Bengal.\"\n\nThis comes at a time when West Bengal is in the grip of tension after violent protests erupted during a roadshow of Bharatiya Janta Party President Amit Shah in Kolkata recently.\n\nThe viral post can be viewed here and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe video has been shared with the same caption on several right wing pages as well as individual profiles.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found that the original video is from Tongi in Bangladesh. The incident took place on December 1, 2018.\n\nDhaka Tribune reported that clashes between two factions of the Tabligh Jamaat 'over establishing dominance at the Bishwa Ijtema (Global Congregation) grounds' which claimed one life and left over 200 injured.\n\nBishwa Ijtema is a non-political annual gathering of Muslims in Tongi, Bangladesh. The prayer meeting is a three-day long affair which sees Muslims from world over coming to Tongi\n\nSuch clashes have been taking place ever since the Tabligh's Bangladesh chapter split into two groups over differences between the top leaders of the jamaat. You can read more about the Tabligh Jamaat, and the violent clashes here and here.\n\nBOOM had earlier debunked a similar fake claim which had shared videos from the same incident.\n\nAlso Read: Bangladesh Video Shared As Muslims Rioting In West Bengal", "lang": "en"}
