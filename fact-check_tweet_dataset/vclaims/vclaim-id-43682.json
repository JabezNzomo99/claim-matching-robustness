Orrin Hatch of Utah, who is mentioned in the story, who made a similar statement about Trump at the end of November.\n\nWhen Hatch was asked about a series of anti-Muslim videos that Trump had retweeted, the longtime senator said: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of it. I don\u2019t pay much attention to his tweets. I\u2019ll say this for ya: He\u2019s been one of the best presidents I\u2019ve served under. And the reasoning is, he\u2019s not afraid to make decisions. He\u2019s not afraid to take on the big mouths around here.\u201d\n\nThe story also claims that O\u2019Neal said Trump \u201cshould be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a solid, reasonable, and coordinate way.\u201d That\u2019s false, too. A similar quote was misattributed to actor Kevin Bacon, as we wrote last year.\n\nIt was singer Ted Nugent who wrote almost that exact line about Trump in 2015. Nugent declared: \u201cDonald Trump should be given the Medal of Freedom for speaking his mind in such a bold, honest and straight-forward manner.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also no record of O\u2019Neal saying \u201cthe reality is that people need to start fighting for this country together with him instead of criticizing and wasting their time on stupid things.\u201d That same statement also was wrongly attributed to Bacon last year, according to entertainment myth-busting website Gossip Cop.\n\n\n\nThe basketball legend may not have called Trump the \u201cbest president \u2026 of all times ever,\u201d but he has said complimentary things about him as a person.\n\nO\u2019Neal, who was a guest at Trump\u2019s 2005 wedding to Melania Knauss, referred to Trump as \u201ca friend of mine\u201d when answering reporters\u2019 questions in 2015. In his response, O\u2019Neal said Trump is a \u201cstraight-up guy\u201d who sometimes \u201cjust says it wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd after Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory, O\u2019Neal said: \u201cNow that he\u2019s president-elect, you just hope that he can make the world a better place. He won fair and square. We have to give him a chance. There\u2019s no need talking about recounts and this and that.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cSHAQUILLE O\u2019NEAL SAYS: \u2018TRUMP IS POSSIBLY THE BEST PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF ALL TIMES EVER, HE IS NOT AFRAID TO\u2026 .'\u201d Nebraskadaily.sie. 10 Sep 2018.\n\n\u201cShaquille O\u2019Neal Says: \u2018Trump is Possibly the Best President of the President Of All Times Ever, He Is Not Afraid To \u2026 .'\u201d Proconservativenews.com. 10 Dec 2017.\n\n\u201cSHAQUILLE O\u2019NEAL SAYS: \u2018TRUMP IS POSSIBLY THE BEST PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF ALL TIMES EVER, HE IS NOT AFRAID TO\u2026 .'\u201d Tulsapost.club. 24 Aug 2018.\n\nTanner, Courtney. \u201cSen.
