They are signed by Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, as is routine.\n\nThe committee reports show that about 90 percent of the committee costs relate to personnel. The staff directors for the Republicans and the Democrats each make more than $170,000 a year. Quite a few other staff members make close to that amount, largely because of their expertise.\n\nBut as is standard, the minority accounts for about one-third of the expenses. So far, the committee has not spent all of the funds that were apportioned to it. The numbers work out like this:\n\nNote: the Democrats have a running tab on the Web that actually shows spending of more than $6.9 million. Democrats acknowledged it\u2019s a little off, saying that it is an estimate based on the previous month\u2019s expenses. Recent staff departures have slowed spending, making the estimate run a bit faster than actual expenses.\n\nDemocrats allege that Republicans have wasted nearly $30,000 on a \u201clavish\u201d overseas trip; Republicans say it was for two people who traveled by commercial coach and had simple working lunches on military bases. Republicans claim that the Democrats awarded themselves more than $30,000 in staff bonuses, but Democrats say the number reflects salary adjustments for staff promotions.\n\nBoth sides accuse the other of making unreasonable requests or taking steps that have resulted in dragging out the investigation. The list of complaints from both is rather endless, reflecting the high level of acrimony on the committee.\n\nTo put the nearly $6.8 million in perspective, the State Department received $6.5 million in reprogrammed funds from Congress in fiscal 2015 and 2016 for a new unit that responds to congressional requests, including inquiries from the Benghazi Committee, according to a State Department official. That figure does not include the efforts of the Freedom of Information Act office and legal and regional officials at the Department to re-digitize Clinton\u2019s 30,000 emails and make them ready for public release.\n\n\u201cNone of the expenditures of the Committee would be necessary but for Chairman Gowdy\u2019s repeated decisions to delay our work into the election year and continue requesting more and more interviews and documents,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, Democrats could walk away, but as we have seen repeatedly, the American people need someone in the room to protect the truth.\u201d\n\nIt is too facile for Democrats to pin all of the spending for the Benghazi committee on Republicans. One-third of the spending goes to Democratic staff and expenses, and that should be acknowledged in Democratic statements. Democrats choose to participate in the committee and hire staff, meaning they share in the cost as well.", "lang": "en"}
