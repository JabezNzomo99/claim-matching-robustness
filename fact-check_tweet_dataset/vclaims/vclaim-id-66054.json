On the site, constituents can voice their displeasure with any government regulations disrupting their everyday lives.\n\nWhen the Missouri General Assembly passes a statute, its role in the lawmaking process is done. Now, to enforce the laws, that\u2019s up to agencies in the executive branch. Regulations provide detail to statutes.\n\nAccording to Maura Browning, director of communications for the Secretary of State\u2019s office, individual agencies have their own set of rules for creating regulations. Once they follow their process for making a regulation, it becomes part of the Code of State Regulations.\n\nThere are 22 separate titles in the code, many with dozens of chapters under multiple divisions. These encompass the 113,000 regulations Greitens was talking about in his post. Title 4, the Department of Economic Development, alone has 369 chapters.\n\nWhen you go to the No MO Red Tape website, a George Mason University study pops up explaining where the large number came from. The university used a tool it developed called StateReg data, an algorithm that reads large regulatory documents. It processes words like \"shall,\" \"must,\" \"may not,\" \"prohibited,\" and \"required\" to indicate where there are legal restrictions or obligations in the Missouri Code of State Regulations.\n\nGreitens\u2019 main goal with the No MO Red Tape website is to allow small businesses to thrive without interference from the government. Browning pointed out that regulations also restrict local governments, school boards, counties and other local entities.\n\nAs of Oct. 31, Missouri citizens had submitted 4,226 commentsto No MO Red Tape for various regulations. Eighty-nine percent of the comments criticized regulations. Most complaints targeted the Agriculture Department, which received 2,175 comments. Conservation was next with 658, then Public Safety with 236 comments. Finally, the Health and Senior Services department received 201 comments.\n\nBefore the website was established, constituents always had the option to complain to elected officials, said Lael Keiser, an MU political science professor. That\u2019s part of the basic relationship between representatives and who they represent. No MO Red Tape just makes commenting more accessible.\n\nThe governor\u2019s goal is to reduce regulations. One way he could do that is through appointing new heads to the state\u2019s agencies, Keiser said. Assuming the appointees share the governor\u2019s view of less government interference, they\u2019ll review the statutes and determine which regulations to throw out.\n\nSo how does 7.5 million words of regulations stack up in dictionaries? Greitens claimed the regulations would fill 40 dictionaries. That allots roughly 187,500 words per dictionary. We got no response from Merriam-Webster in our quest to find a definite number of words in one of its dictionaries.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s fact page says the second edition\u2019s entire text had 59 million words in just 336 pages. This figure dwarves the number Greitens used, but his office never clarified which dictionaries they were referring to. They also didn\u2019t specify if \"words\" meant individual entries in the dictionary, or every word on the page.", "lang": "en"}
