This video has been sent by a Kashmiri sister. Quaid-e-Azam has ordered the army to march towards Kashmir. We are providing diplomatic, moral and political support.\"\n\nTwitter handle @Timesofgaza also tweeted the same video with the caption, \"Indian forces are brutally killing people in Kashmir during the lockdown.\"\n\nBy the time of filing the story, it was retweeted more than 1,100 times.\n\nWe found a user who shared the original video of the incident under the comments section of Abdullah's tweet.\n\nThis took us to the video uploaded by the YouTube channel named \"Kashmir news\" on October 21, 2018.\n\nThe description attached to this video mentioned about the rising of the death toll in Kulgam.\n\nTo confirm the incident, we ran a search on the internet and found many media reports. As per the reports, during an encounter between security forces and militants in Kulgam, dozens of civilians got injured in a blast at the gunfight site.\n\nAmong them, seven lost their lives.\n\nIt is clear that the video shared by Abdullah Gul is not a latest video.", "lang": "en"}
