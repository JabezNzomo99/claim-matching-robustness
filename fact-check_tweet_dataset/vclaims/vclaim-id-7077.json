No, that's not true: the story came from a military satire website that made up the story for a laugh. It is not real.\n\nThe article was published on May 17, 2018 by Duffel Blog under the headline \"Navy to christen USS Tig Ol Bitties after service allows people to vote online for ship's name\" (archived here) and it opened:\n\nWASHINGTON - Heads are shaking while others cheer after a failed publicity stunt led to the Navy's next Zumwalt-class destroyer being named the USS Tig Ol Bitties, sources confirmed today. The Navy earlier this year had allowed active duty Sailors and Marines to vote on the name for its new $4-billion dollar stealth attack ship, all in an effort to boost force morale and social media presence. \"I thought there was no way in hell any of the finalist names would fly,\" said Marine Staff Sgt. Steve Kovacs, \"But then I said, hell, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\" Kovacs and many other Marines were hoping to clench the name USS Lord Mattis in honor of the Defense Secretary, but support for Tig Ol Bitties became overwhelming after the polling website was shared by service-members, civilians, and tweeted repeatedly by musician Kid Rock.\n\nPeople could be forgiven for thinking it was real because a similar thing happened in Britain when an online poll resulted in the name Boaty McBoatface being chosen for a research vessel:\n\nIn the end the research vessel was named RSS Sir David Attenborough but a small submersible carried aboard was eventually named BoatyMcBoatface:\n\nThe website Duffelblog.com is a military-themed satire website which sports following legal disclaimer on its 'about' page:\n\nWe are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet.
