The quote stemmed from her old speech for the Independence Day rally in 2018 where she said that the youth have no bright future because of the administration's policies. She made no mention of Duterte.\n\nIn June 2018, Kabataan party-list held a #HINDINPENDENCEDay (Not independence Day) protest in the Chinese consulate in Manila for the 120th anniversary of the proclamation of Philippine independence.\n\nBelow is the transcript of the part of the video that refers to the quote:\n\n(The youth today have no bright future because of the implementation of reforms like K to 12 which [the administration] continues to impose on the youth, on teachers, and on the education sector, to contribute to the expansion of the labor sector that continues to be stingy with the pay of our workers).\n\nThe quote also appeared to have been a twisted version of Abante.com's report published in 2018 with a headline: \"Elago: Walang kinabukasan ang mga kabataan sa polisiya ni Duterte (Elago: the youth have no future with Duterte\u2019s policies).\"\n\nVera Files had also debunked the claim on October 30. However, there are Facebook pages that still continue to repost the claim.\n\nThis is not the first time that false quotes have been attributed to Elago. Rappler previously fact-checked a claim of her supposed \"response\" to parents of student activists in August 2019. \u2014 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
