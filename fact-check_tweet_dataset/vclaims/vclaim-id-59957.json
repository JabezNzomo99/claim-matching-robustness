It is being claimed that the man in the picture is the son of Israeli Defense Minister, Robert Gates.\n\nThe caption translated from Urdu read: \u201cMalala Yousafzai with the son of Israeli Defense Minister Robert Gates Which will lead the Pakistani nation in the future\u201d\n\nAt the time of filing this report, the above post was shared over 26,000 times.\n\nAnother identical post can be seen here.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above picture and found that the claim attached to the picture is false.\n\nOn putting the picture through Reverse Image Search, we came across a video of Pakistani cricketer Faisal Iqbal dated July 22, 2020, in which he is slamming the people for spreading the picture with a false claim.\n\nIn a 5:43 minutes video, Iqbal clarified that the picture was taken in the US and he had recently posted the picture to wish Malala on her birthday on July 12, 2020, after which people started sharing the picture with the false claim.\n\nIqbal posted the same picture with Malala in December 2019 at US OPEN Cricket.\n\nMoreover, the Defence Minister of Israel is Benny Gantz and NOT Robert Gates as claimed in the viral post. We went through Benny Gantz\u2019s son Nadav Gantz\u2019s Instagram profile and he looks nowhere close to the man in the picture.\n\nBased on Fact check is done by NewsMobile through multiple sources and tools we can confirm that this post is FAKE. And the claims are false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
