Sanjay Raut, Stop her if you can.)\n\n \n\n\n\nAt the time of filing this report, the above post had more than 1,000 shares on Facebook.\n\nSimilar posts can be seen here and here.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the post and found that it is being falsely attributed to Raj Thackeray.\n\nWe checked the Twitter handle that posted the tweet. We found that the tweet was made from an unverified account.\n\nWhile investigating, we also noticed that the user changed the user handle from @RealThackeray (as seen in the screenshot) to @TheThackerayRaj. However, all the replies made to the tweet, before the handle name was changed, were still the old one, which is, @RealThackeray. This proves that both of these are the same account.\n\nMoreover, the official verified handle of Raj Thackeray is @RajThackeray and we did not find any such tweet on his official Twitter handle.\n\nThe above information proves that the tweet going viral was made from a fake account. Hence, the post in question is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
