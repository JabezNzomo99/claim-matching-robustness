There have been no official reports of her death, and she was actively posting on social media on the day that article on her alleged suicide spread.\n\nOn February 14, Bryant posted on Instagram, saying that the Mamba Sports Foundation's name has been changed to Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in memory of both her late husband and daughter. The foundation provides opportunities to young people in sports.\n\nBryant also posted a tribute to Kobe on February 15, saying: \"To my forever Valentine, I love you so much. Missing you so much on your favorite holiday. Te amo per sempre (I love you forever). Kisses to you and Gigi in heaven. Happy Valentine\u2019s Day, my babies. With all my love, your boo-boo.\"\n\nThe video on the website that is allegedly from BBC News plays for a few seconds before warning that the video may show graphic content and viewers must share it to continue watching.\n\nThe website also makes it appear as if the video was shared many times on Facebook, with the numbers \"1.2K Comments 17.3K Shares 2.9M Views\" underneath it. However, these numbers are static text and are not part of an official Facebook interactions counter.\n\nThe video URL actually leads to a 25-second YouTube video titled \"Now its sad\" on the channel \"ashir mohamad.\" This video was uploaded on February 6 and has since accumulated 252,492 views.", "lang": "en"}
