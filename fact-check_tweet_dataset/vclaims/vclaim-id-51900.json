Ron DeSantis claimed during a coronavirus education meeting Thursday that \u201cI don't think, nationwide, there's been a single fatality under 25 [due to the coronavirus].\u201d\n\nFormer New York Times reporter Alex Berenson made a similar claim on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show, stating, \u201ckids, children, anyone under 30 is at no risk to this.\u201d\n\nWhile older patients constitute most coronavirus deaths in the United States and worldwide the U.S. has seen one death of a child between 1 and 4 years old and four deaths among those ages 15 to 24, as of April 4, 2020, according to the CDC. Overall deaths have doubled since then. A Washington Post analysis published on April 8 identified nine patients under the age of 20 who have died from coronavirus and 45 individuals between the ages of 20 and 29 who have died. The Post notes that not every state provides information about the age of coronavirus victims, so the numbers are likely higher. According to CDC data, 25.1 percent of coronavirus cases serious enough to require hospitalization in March were under the age of 50.\n\nIn addition to the health risks posed to the young by the virus, there is also a great deal of concern about young people contracting coronavirus and passing it to older adults and those with underlying health issues who are at higher risk of severe illness and death. Especially since even those with mild or even no symptoms are capable of passing the disease onto others.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
