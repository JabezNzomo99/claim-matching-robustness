This claim, however, is false.\n\nExamples of such posts can be found here , here , and here .\n\nDr. Thomas Nash, an internist, pulmonologist, and infectious disease specialist at New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City ( here ), told Reuters, \u201cThe only thing that hits the mask is what you breathe out,\u201d explaining that healthy people \u201cdon\u2019t exhale fungus.\u201d\n\nNash said that someone who already has a fungal infection in their lungs could possibly contaminate their own mask, but not the other way around.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \u201cfungi are common in the environment, and people breathe in or come in contact with fungal spores every day without getting sick. However, in people with weak immune systems, these fungi are more likely to cause an infection\u201d ( here ).\n\n\u201cA fungus can infect the lung and cause a variety of problems ranging from an abscess to pneumonia to an asthmatic reaction,\u201d Dr. Nash said.\n\nAspergillosis, an infection caused by a type of mold, is one example. The CDC says that \u201cmost strains of this mold are harmless, but a few can cause serious illnesses when people with weakened immune systems, underlying lung disease or asthma inhale their fungal spores\u201d ( here ). Illnesses resulting from aspergillosis typically affect the respiratory system, but symptoms vary widely.\n\nFungal infections Valley fever ( here ) and histoplasmosis ( here ) can infect the lungs of people living in or visiting certain areas ( wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/ ).\n\n\u201cIf I had a mask and left it out in an old shed and I put it back on after a month, maybe it would contain fungus,\u201d Dr. Nash said, calling the trail of logic \u201ca series of impossibilities.\u201d\n\nStill, he advises that people clean reusable masks regularly in order to reduce the risk of spreading the new coronavirus or other germs. Johns Hopkins Medicine provides tips for cleaning a variety of different face masks here .\n\nAs for claims that wearing a face mask causes other health complications, Nash said that \u201csome of the masks are a little too tight\u201d and therefore uncomfortable. But they still \u201callow in plenty of oxygen.\u201d\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic has debunked the myth that \u201cwearing a mask will make me sick\u201d here . The site says that although \u201cthere\u2019s been some speculation on social media that wearing a mask can cause you to rebreathe the carbon dioxide you exhale and make you sick,\u201d it is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that you will inhale high levels of carbon dioxide from wearing a cloth face mask.\n\nReuters Fact Check debunked a claim that wearing a mask would cause hypercapnia here .\n\nFalse. Wearing a face mask to protect from COVID-19 does not cause fungal lung infections.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
