In his latest remarks, Trump did not specify the parade would include the military.\n\nOn 12 February 2019, President Donald Trump addressed Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) David Bernhardt in regards to a parade, or gathering, dubbed \u201cSalute to America,\u201d to be held on the upcoming Independence Day holiday. At the beginning of the meeting, Trump stated:\n\nThank you all for being here. Before we begin, we\u2019re thinking about certain things that we\u2019re just starting to look at. David Bernhardt is, as you know, going through the process \u2014 becoming Secretary of Interior, from Acting. He\u2019s done a fantastic job. And I think it will continue, and we look forward to that. We\u2019re thinking about doing, on the 4th of July or thereabouts, a parade. A \u201cSalute to America\u201d parade. It will be a \u2014 really, a gathering, as opposed to a parade, I\u2019d guess you\u2019d have to say. Perhaps at the Lincoln Memorial. We\u2019re looking at sites. But we\u2019re thinking about doing something, which would become, perhaps, a tradition. \u201cSalute to America\u201d on July 4th or July 4th weekend. Somewhere around that area. And, David, you\u2019re taking charge of that and you\u2019ll see how it works out with schedules and everything else. And I think it could be a very exciting day. And the fireworks is there anyway, so we just saved on fireworks. We get free fireworks because it\u2019s already being done. (Laughter.) So, that\u2019s very good.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks generated a bit of a media stir, including a headline in the New York Post that read, \u201cTrump wants his huge military parade on Fourth of July.\u201d Perhaps because Trump has fruitlessly floated the idea of a military parade in the past, readers questioned whether another one was truly in the works.\n\nWe contacted the Department of Interior to ask what plans for a potential \u201cSalute to America\u201d event were afoot, and we were instructed to direct questions to the White House, with a DOI spokesperson stating, \u201cWe are working diligently to present the best options to the White House.\u201d Our email to the White House press office was not answered.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret Trump has wanted a military parade since witnessing and being impressed by 14 July 2017 Bastille Day festivities on a visit to France. Making one materialize has so far been a non-starter. On 6 February 2018 \u2014 a year before today\u2019s writing \u2014 the Washington Post broke the original story that the Trump administration was in the early stages of planning a military parade for some point in time, in conjunction with the Defense Department.\n\nBut in late summer 2018, Trump backed away from the plan, citing the astronomical cost associated with it, with the New York Times reporting administration officials suffered \u201csticker shock after seeing a Pentagon estimate that soared as high as $92 million to pay for the troops, fighter jets, armored vehicles and other military hardware that would be mustered to satisfy the president\u2019s dream of displaying American might.\u201d\n\nOn July 1, 2019, Trump announced that military tanks would be part of a celebration piggybacking on an already-existing annual July 4th celebration put on by Washington, D.C.\u2019s, local government, which includes fireworks, a music concert, as well as a parade in which uniformed members of the military participate. Trump is planning to speak at the event 2019 event, which is expected to include military flyovers. Protesters are also expected to attend the event.", "lang": "en"}
