No, that's not true. The did not come from Biden's verified Twitter account. Kenosha, Wisconsin, is where Jacob Blake was shot by the police on August 23, 2020, and there have been ongoing protests in the city.\n\nThe claim appeared as a post (archived here) published on Facebook on September 7, 2020, titled: \"When your inner racist comes out....\" It opened:\n\nWhen I was in Kenosha there wasn't half the damage that real Donald Trump made it out to be. He's always gaslighting that the problems are in Democrat ran cities. What I observed in Kenosha was fewer black people than in major cities which means less looting. So we can't just say the problems are just because who runs the cities and states.\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThis tweet was not sent from Biden's account.\n\nThe Facebook post above the tweet did not have identifying tags.\n\nOn other Facebook accounts the fake tweet shows metadata including a date, number of retweets and likes as well as showing it was sent from \"Twitter for iPhone.\"\n\nThe tweet metadata says it was sent at 9:12 am on 04/09/2020. In the United States the date is written month, day, year which would make the date the tweet is sent April 9, 2020. Biden did not send this tweet on April 9, 2020 either.\n\nThe creator of the fake tweet used the European way of writing the date, which is day, month, year to indicate September 4, 2020. Biden also did not send this tweet on September 4, 2020.\n\nBiden tweeted/re-tweeted seven times on September 4, 2020, and this tweet was not one of them.", "lang": "en"}
