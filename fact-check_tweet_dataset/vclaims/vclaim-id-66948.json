Rajput was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14. @iaMeetuSingh tweeted a picture of the late actor with his sister Meetu Singh and wrote, \u201cMissing u immensely my soulmate @itsSSR; you will always be in my heart\u2026. no words to describe the void.\u201d This was retweeted less than 300 times. (archived link)\n\n\n\nTimes Now not only tweeted about the account but also aired it as \u2018breaking\u2019 news.\n\nSushant Singh Rajput reportedly had four sisters Shweta, Priyanka, Meetu and Neetu. Alt News performed a keyword search on Twitter and found that on August 19, Shweta had tweeted that @iaMeetuSingh is a fake account.\n\nShweta follows the genuine account of Meetu which is @divinemitz.\n\nAdditionally, Alt News found that the image posted by the imposter account was earlier shared by Meetu on her Instagram account.\n\nFurthermore, the caption used to post the image was identical to the tweet made by Sushant\u2019s sister Priyanka on August 3.\n\nThere are several other hints which suggest that @iaMeetuSingh is an imposter account. It is newly created and has far less number of followers than Meetu\u2019s genuine account. This misinformation was earlier fact-checked by Boomlive.\n\nTimes Nows fell for an imposter account and turned it into \u2018breaking news\u2019. Earlier, IANS had promoted tweets by a fake account posing as Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s father and Aaj Tak had fallen for a fake account dedicated to the actor himself.", "lang": "en"}
