But the Facebook page behind the claim is fake and a spokesman for Dangote's business empire told AFP the posts are a 'scam'.\n\nThe posts, which we've archived here, here and here, were all published on a Facebook page, 'Dangote New Month Hot GiveAway' on November 6.\n\n'My name is Dangote, I am the richest man in Africa', says one of the posts, referring to Nigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote.\n\nThe post, which has racked up over 6,000 shares, asks Facebook users to leave a comment asking for something from a list including 'money', 'car', and 'promote your business'. It promises that Dangote will 'surprise' them.\n\nThe three posts have attracted thousands of shares and hundreds of comments, including pleas for everything from cars to 'money for medical expenses' and 'money to further more my education'.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for Dangote's business empire told AFP the Facebook page was \"a scam\".\n\n\"We also came across this offer on Facebook, and as you can see, it is from a page created in Nigeria. It is all fake,\" Jean Kadje-Kamga, Senior Public Relations Officer for Dangote Cement Cameroon told AFP by e-mail.\n\n\"Dangote Industries Limited is in no way giving out what is listed below. It is a fake, and you should rather consider it as a scam,\" he said.\n\nThe posts began surfacing shortly after a genuine giveaway by the Dangote Group, which ran this summer and was extended until October 31. It invited customers to buy a promotional bag of cement to be in with a chance of winning prizes, including cars and TVs.\n\nForbes magazine lists 62-year-old cement tycoon Aliko Dangote as Africa's richest man, with an estimated $8.8 billion net worth.\n\nHe is the founder of multi-billion dollar Dangote Group, which manufactures cement and various other products including sugar, salt and flour.\n\nIn April, he told a forum in Ivory Coast that he once withdrew $10 million in cash just to look at it and 'believe I have money'.", "lang": "en"}
