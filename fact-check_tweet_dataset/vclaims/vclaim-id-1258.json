This claim is false. Another photograph from the incident shows that the alleged weapon was actually the drawstrings from the man\u2019s sweatpants.\n\nThe claim, shared over 2,700 times as of July 21, is visible here .\n\nLast month, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in the United Kingdom to condemn police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis ( here ).\n\nStatues of historical figures, including Winston Churchill, which have been at the forefront of demonstrations by anti-racism groups, were boarded up ahead of the protests in the capital ( here ).\n\nOn June 13, clashes broke out between far-right protesters and anti-racist demonstrators outside London\u2019s Waterloo station, with fireworks thrown before police cordoned off areas ( here ).\n\nOne encounter resulted in injuries against an unnamed man, visible in the posts on social media. Graphic footage from the incident is visible here .\n\nThe original photograph from the altercation was captured by Daniel Leal-Olivas for AFP, and can be seen bit.ly/2WDbu0w . Another image from the encounter depicts the same suspected attacker in a different position and shows that the \u201cmetal spikes\u201d are actually the drawstrings from his sweatpants, ( bit.ly/32Sl1VF ).\n\nIt is therefore false to claim that the man in question was wielding a weapon.\n\nReuters recently debunked a similar claim alleging that a protester had aimed a firearm at a St. Louis couple during a demonstration. The fact-check is visible here .\n\nFalse. Man did not attack counter-protester in London with metal spikes. The \u201cspikes\u201d are actually the drawstrings from his sweatpants.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
