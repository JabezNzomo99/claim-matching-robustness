But is there anything to Trump\u2019s claim that terrorism was what motivated Moscow?\n\n\"There have never been any terrorist attacks from Afghanistan in Russia from the creation of the universe until now,\" said Barnett Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at New York University\u2019s Center on International Cooperation.\n\n\"A few Chechens and Arabs who went to Chechnya participated in acts of terror in the 1990s,\" he added. \"None of them came from Afghanistan to do so, though some may have been there at one time, and not a single Afghan has ever been involved.\"\n\nIn other words, Trump\u2019s retelling of Russia\u2019s invasion is completely mistaken.\n\n\"The Soviet Union\u2019s primary motivation to invade Afghanistan was to balance against a perceived growing U.S. interest in Afghanistan in the late 1970s,\" said Seth Jones, a political scientist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It was about cold, calculating balance-of-power politics.\"\n\nMoscow and Washington competed for sway over Afghanistan beginning in the 1950s. Its value as a Cold War bargaining chip lay in the fact that it was the Soviet Union\u2019s southern neighbor, with the two sharing a nearly 1,500-mile border.\n\nThe rivalry for Afghanistan began peacefully as a bidding war for Kabul\u2019s affections. At the outset, each side attempted to curry favor through economic aid and other soft power measures, said Benjamin Hopkins, a professor of history and international affairs at George Washington University.\n\nBut over the following decades the rivalry grew more tense as Afghan politics frayed.\n\nThe Soviet Union viewed Afghanistan as part of its natural sphere of influence, while the United States saw it as the Soviet regime\u2019s \"soft underbelly,\" in the words of former U.S. diplomat Graham Fuller.\n\n\"The United States saw this as an area of competition precisely because of Afghanistan\u2019s proximity to the Soviet Union,\" said Benjamin Hopkins, a professor of history and international affairs at George Washington University. \"They saw this as an easier way in to undermine the Soviet Union.\"\n\nIn his political history of Afghanistan, In the Graveyard of Empires, Jones, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, relied on declassified Soviet documents that give a window into Moscow\u2019s thinking at the time.\n\nIn fall 1979, Soviet leadership grew increasingly worried that a new Afghan leader, Hafizullah Amin, was too amenable to Western influence. Or worse, that he was an agent of the CIA.\n\nThe KGB warned the Politburo that Amin might turn to the United States for help with tamping down his country\u2019s lingering civil unrest.\n\nIn early December, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev convened his inner circle to discuss options, amid growing fears that the United States was increasingly eyeing Afghanistan.\n\nSoviet leadership decided to have the KGB depose Amin and replace him with Babrak Karmal, one of the leaders of the far-left April Revolution of the previous year. Brezhnev and his advisers also weighed deploying a large-scale contingent of troops to stabilize the country.\n\nBy Dec. 27, 1979, Soviet forces numbered 50,000, with 5,000 troops and special forces positioned around the Afghan capital of Kabul, according to Jones\u2019 account. Covert KGB forces launched an assault on the presidential palace where Amin and his security guards were located.\n\n\"Amin\u2019s guards fought back for several hours,\" Jones wrote, \"but they were ultimately overcome, and KGB forces assassinated Amin.\"\n\nIn his place, Soviets installed their hand-picked successor, Babrak Karmal, who would lead Afghanistan for 7 years. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan wore on for even longer, ultimately ending in defeat in February 1989.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump conflated several details related to the Soviet-Afghan conflict.\n\nWithin days of the Soviet invasion, the U.S. launched a covert strategy to give lethal aid to Afghan Mujahideen insurgents who were fighting the occupying Soviet forces. Osama bin Laden, who would later become the world\u2019s most notorious terrorist, was among a contingent of Arab fighters who fought against the Soviets alongside the Mujahideen.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting there\u2019s no evidence the United States directly armed or funded bin Laden (hat tip to our friends at Factcheck.org), though it\u2019s possible this common misconception was on Trump\u2019s mind at the time of his claim. In any event, U.S. aid went to the Afghan insurgents only after the Soviet invasion.\n\nTrump said, \"The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia.\"\n\nThe Soviet Union\u2019s motivation for invading Afghanistan was about Cold War balance-of-power politics. At no point has Afghanistan served as a launchpad for terrorist attacks in Russia, historians said.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
