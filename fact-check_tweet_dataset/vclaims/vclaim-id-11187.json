It is not true.\n\nThe false report by \"News 4\" purports that \"several hundred people to the hospital and is responsible for parasitic symptoms such as fever, rash, vomiting and stomach bloating.\" Again, it is false.\n\nThe story was accompanied by a photo of a baby eel, which the publisher wanted you to think was the offending parasite. A reverse image revealed the same image was posted on a story about juvenile eels in 2013.\n\nThere is NO Dasani recall. Drink up and enjoy without the fear of a tiny eel slithering down your throat. And when you see the hoax posted by a Facebook friend, put our story below it in response.", "lang": "en"}
