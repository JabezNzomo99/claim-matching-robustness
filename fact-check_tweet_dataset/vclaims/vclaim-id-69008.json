And at times, its event at the former Pabst brewery site in Milwaukee, brought out the whimsical side of the candidates. Mahlon Mitchell, a firefighter and firefighters union president, used his time for a closing argument to put on firefighter gear in under 60 seconds. And Tony Evers recited the Gettysburg Address and took a selfie with the crowd.\n\nBut the forum was serious, too, including when the host asked:\n\n\"What would you do to make college more affordable?\"\n\nEvers answered first. He noted that as part of his role as the state supreintendent of schools, he serves on the state Board of Regents, which governs the University of Wisconsin System. Then he attacked Republican Gov. Scott Walker, saying:\n\n\"Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we\u2019ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the (UW) system to 15 percent.\"\n\nThat would be a precipitous drop of 35 percentage points.\n\nWalker and the GOP-run Legislature did cut $250 million from the UW System in the 2015-\u201917 state budget. And Democrats have attacked Walker on education funding ahead of the Aug. 14, 2018 primary, as they compete to be the nominee running against the two-term incumbent in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election.\n\nBut in this case, the attack misses.\n\n\"Tony misspoke,\" his campaign spokeswoman Maggie Gau told us. \"We acknowledge it's not correct. As much as we try to prevent them, no one is perfect and mistakes happen on the trail.\"\n\nThe UW System is composed of 13 campuses, including the University of Wisconsin-Madison, that offer four-year and advanced degrees, and 13 campuses that offer two-year degrees. Currently, its operating budget is about $6 billion per year, with about $1 billion \u2014 17 percent \u2014 coming from state funding.\n\nTo see whether that percentage has changed during Walker\u2019s tenure as governor, we turned to a state agency, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. (Federal funding and tuition are the two other largest sources of funding, and there are others, as well.)\n\nHere is how much of the UW System operating budgets has come from state funding since the year before Walker took office as governor:\n\nSo, state funding of the UW System was nowhere near the 50 percent Evers claimed when Walker took office. Rather, it was 21 percent.\n\nSince Walker became governor, state funding has been below the 21 percent. Now it\u2019s at about 17 percent, a drop of about 4 percentage points since Walker took office \u2014 though above the 15 percent Evers claimed.\n\nEvers said: \"Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we\u2019ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the\" University of Wisconsin System \"to 15 percent.\"\n\nThe gap is much narrower.\n\nState funding made up about 21 percent, not 50 percent, of the UW Systems\u2019s operating budget when Walker took office.\n\nIt\u2019s now at 17 percent, not 15 percent.", "lang": "en"}
