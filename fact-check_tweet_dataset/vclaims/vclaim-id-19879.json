That overall finding is no surprise. As the report notes in its introduction, the ACA changed how insurers could price plans on the individual market \u2014 limiting price differentials based on age, and banning pricing based on health status or gender. And the law required insurers to accept any customer, regardless of preexisting conditions, and include a set of essential benefits in their plans.\n\nThat means cheap, skimpy plans for healthy customers became a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cIn most states these regulations increased insurance coverage requirements and would be expected, on average, to increase the price of ACA-compliant plans relative to pre-ACA plans all else equal,\u201d the HHS report said.\n\nBut as the report itself makes clear, its specific figures on increases from 2013 to 2017 come with some caveats or limitations.\n\nThe \u201creal numbers,\u201d as Pence put it, on the increase in individual market premiums pre- and post-ACA may not be quite as high as a doubling. And more important, Pence, as we\u2019ve seen politicians do repeatedly, doesn\u2019t make clear that he\u2019s only talking about the individual market and not average premiums overall. About 7 percent of the total population gets coverage on the individual, or nongroup, market, where people who don\u2019t have employer-sponsored coverage or insurance through government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare buy their own policies. More specific to this report, 9.2 million people in 2017 enrolled in plans in the 39 HealthCare.gov states, the focus of the HHS analysis, not \u201cacross this country,\u201d as Pence said.\n\nThe HHS report found that \u201caverage exchange premiums were 105% higher in the 39 states using Healthcare.gov in 2017 than average individual market premiums in 2013,\u201d an increase from a $232 average monthly premium to $476. The analysis used two different data sets. HHS used what\u2019s called MLR data (medical loss ratio) for the individual market in 2013 and compared that to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on plans purchased through the HealthCare.gov websites in the 39 states using the federally run exchange in 2017.\n\nHHS acknowledges that this isn\u2019t a \u201cperfect comparison,\u201d but says it \u201cprovides an approximation for how average individual market premiums have increased\u201d under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe medical loss ratio data, which insurers send to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to HHS, is only available through 2015. But the data that are available show that the average MLR premiums have been lower than average HealthCare.gov exchange premiums under the CMS data. (See Appendix B in the HHS report.)\n\nFor instance, using the MLR-to-CMS comparison shows a 53.4 percent increase in average premiums from 2013 to 2015 in those 39 states, but using an MLR-to-MLR comparison shows a 41.8 percent increase for the same time frame. Either is still a sizable increase, but shows the HHS\u2019 less-than-perfect comparison may be skewed higher than an apples-to-apples comparison would reveal.\n\nThere are other limitations, most of which the HHS report also acknowledges:\n\u2022 This comparison excludes off-exchange, individual market premiums in 2017. Those buying their own insurance but not through the exchanges don\u2019t get premium tax credits. They\u2019re paying full price, so they often buy less generous coverage, Cynthia Cox, the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s associate director for the Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance, told us. Including off-exchange premiums could therefore lower the average premium for 2017.\n\u2022 Also, HealthCare.gov states have \u201cslightly higher premiums\u201d on average than the state-based exchanges, Cox said, largely due to demographic reasons and southern states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid. The HHS report says that looking at national premiums could in fact lead to different results. \u201cTo the extent that trends are different in state based exchanges (SBEs), especially large SBEs like California and New York, the national average increase may differ from what is reported in this Data Point.\u201d Three million people signed up for the state-based marketplaces in 2017, HHS says.\n\u2022 There\u2019s no adjustment for the type of people getting these insurance plans in 2013 versus 2017. The risk pool has changed. Now, because of the health care law, insurers have to take everyone regardless of preexisting conditions and can\u2019t charge them more. \u201cOlder and less healthy people are a larger share of the individual market risk pool now than in 2013,\u201d the HHS report says. \u201cThe changing mix of enrollees and adverse selection pressure has likely been a significant cause of the large average premium increases in the individual market over this four-year period.\u201d This also means some with HealthCare.gov plans in 2017 weren\u2019t getting individual market plans in 2013.\n\n The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects the mix of insured on the individual market would change under the House-passed American Health Care Act. The GOP bill would allow insurers to charge older people more, and, as a result, there would be a disproportionate increase in the number of low-income older individuals without insurance, and higher premiums for those in that demographic who remain in the nongroup market, CBO says.\n\u2022 One thing the report doesn\u2019t mention is that 83 percent of the people buying on the exchanges get premium tax credits that keep their out-of-pocket premiums costs at a certain percentage of their income, according to a March HHS report. So most people on the exchanges aren\u2019t actually paying the premium prices in 2017 that HHS includes in its report. But, of course, 17 percent of those on the exchanges, plus those buying off-exchange plans, don\u2019t get those tax credits.\n\nNot surprisingly, the report found that states that already had insurance benefit requirements similar to those that went into effect in 2014 under the ACA, \u201chad smaller premium increases between 2013 and 2017.\u201d\n\nAs previous HHS analyses of individual market premiums have shown, there was variation among the states, ranging from a 12 percent premium increase in New Jersey to a 223 percent increase in Alabama. Twenty-four of the 39 states, however, had average increases of 100 percent or more.\n\nAnd, as we\u2019ve often noted, how the premium increases affect those who buy their own insurance depends on the individual. For those who are healthy and were happy with less-generous benefits, their premiums likely went up. For those with preexisting conditions, their premiums may have gone down, even before factoring in tax credits.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation 2014 survey asked those who bought insurance on the individual market in 2013 and again in 2014, under the ACA requirements, about their experiences. Whether those individuals paid more or less for their premiums, after tax credits, was largely split: Forty-six percent said their monthly out-of-pocket premium was lower, while 39 percent said their premium was higher. Fifteen percent said it was about the same.", "lang": "en"}
