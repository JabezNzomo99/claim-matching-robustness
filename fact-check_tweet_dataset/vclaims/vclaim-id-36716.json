BOOM found that one of the images had been flipped to falsely claim that Ghosh was photographed with different hands being bandaged on two different occasions.\n\n\n\nJNU students came under an attack by a mob of masked men and women on January 5 evening. Several students, teachers and staff of the varsity were injured as the unidentified mob went about ransacking the premises and beating them.\n\nImages of an injured Ghosh are doing the rounds with the caption, \"You will not know, when the bandage from the left hand will jump to the right hand.\" (Original text in Bengali: \u0995\u0996\u09a8 \u09af\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be\u09ae \u09b9\u09be\u09a4\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a3\u09cd\u09a1\u09c7\u099c \u09b2\u09be\u09ab \u09ae\u09c7\u09b0\u09c7 \u09a6\u09c7\u09a8 \u09b9\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 \u099a\u09b2\u09c7 \u0986\u09b8\u09ac\u09c7 \u0986\u09aa\u09a8\u09bf \u09a7\u09b0\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09ac\u09c7\u09a8 \u09a8\u09be )\n\nNetizens have also called out Ghosh, for \"such an error.\" One such post has been captioned as, \"To err is to human. You all blame her for no reason.\"\n\nSwarajya columnist Shefali Vaidya tweeted the same mirror image of Aishe Ghosh, along with another, where she can be seen wearing a bandage on her left forearm. Vaidya took a dig at filmmaker Anurag Kashyap for not 'coaching students on continuity.'\n\nKashyap in turn hit back with a mirrored image of Vaidya.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that one of the images in the collage had been flipped in a 180 degree angle and is a mirror image of the original. We were able to find the original image, where Ghosh can be seen addressing students, a day after the attack. The image was clicked by photojournalist Vipin Kumar, of Hindustan Times for Getty Images.\n\nBelow is a comparison of both the images, which shows that they are the same. The text in the background has been inverted in the flipped photograph.\n\nBOOM also found a Facebook Live video from January 6, when Ghosh was addressing the varsity students. At 0.28 second mark onward, Ghosh can be seen speaking with a left arm injury.", "lang": "en"}
