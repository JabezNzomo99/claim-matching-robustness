As the state news agency TASS reported on Jan. 11:\n\n\u201cThe US destroyer crossed traffic lane of the Russian Navy ship in the Arabian Sea, as the American crew was acting unprofessionally, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Friday.\u201d\n\nAccording to TASS, the Russian Defense Ministry statement cited the 1972 Convention on International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS), which, among other issues, regulate which vessel has the right-of-way in a number of maritime situations. Specifically, they cite Rule 15, which states:\n\n\u201cWhen two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet voiced its own complaint, accusing the Russian vessel of \u201caggressively approaching\u201d the Farragut from the rear. The Navy Times reported that the American ship sounded \u201cfive short blasts, the international maritime signal for a danger of collision.\u201d The fleet\u2019s statement said that the Russian vessel initially ignored the warning but did ultimately change its course.\n\nOn Twitter, the 5th Fleet released two video clips, one shot from the starboard deck of the Farragut showing the Russian vessel moving alongside it, almost parallel. The second video shows a view at the Farragut\u2019s stern, where the Russian vessel can be seen crossing the path of the Farragut from behind and coming very close to its stern. It is not clear whether either vessel accelerated or decelerated when they came close, although it appears that the Russian ship closes in on the Farragut. In both videos, the Farragut\u2019s warning horn blasts can be heard.\n\nIn the first video, the Russian vessel is to the starboard of the Farragut, suggesting it could have right-of-way as per COLREGS. However, it is not clear from that video whether they were on a course to intersect. That does appear to be the case in the second video, where each ship\u2019s wake can be seen. Their paths cross behind the Farragut, however, with the Russian vessel coming within shouting distance to the Farragut before crossing. The Farragut\u2019s warning blasts can also be heard during this clip.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first such faceoff between the two navies.\n\nLast summer, a similar dispute arose in the Philippine Sea between the USS Chancellorsville and a different Russian naval vessel. The U.S. Navy asserted that the Chancellorsville, a cruiser, had the right of way because it was waiting for its helicopter to land on deck at the time it was approached by the Russian ship. According COLREGS, a vessel in the process of recovering an aircraft is classified as a \u201cvessel restricted in her ability to maneuver,\u201d and thus should be avoided by other vessels.\n\nOnce again, the Russians blamed the Americans, and the U.S. Navy provided photos and video that appeared to support its claims.", "lang": "en"}
