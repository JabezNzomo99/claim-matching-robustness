HGS Dhaliwal, an Executive Director of Security at the Airport Authority of India, had shared the video on September 15 with the caption \u2013 \u201cBaby Bagged!! A 5 month old baby was kidnapped and carried to Dubai from Karachi inside a Travel Bag. Fortunately, it was detected at Dubai Airport and the baby was found safe!!\u201d\n\nSoon after the tweet went viral, multiple media outlets \u2013 Mirror Now, The Tribune, Latestly \u2013 wrote articles based on the claims made by Dhaliwal.\n\nThe video in question was earlier shared by a Twitter user on Jun 24, 2019. It attracted 2 million views.\n\nA text search on Facebook revealed to us that the same video was shared by one Parvez Khan on November 4, 2018. It had garnered 83,000 shares.\n\nA Twitter user had commented that the bag and the accessories seen in the video are of Saudi Arabian brand, Al-Saniedi.\n\nTaking this as a hint, we performed a time-search on Twitter for the word \u2018baby\u2019 in Arabic (\u0637\u0641\u0644 and \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644) and found an October 2018 tweet by a user @ProfAlsaadi.\n\nThe video shared by @ProfAlsaadi carried a watermark which read \u2018noash_a\u2019.\n\nWhile we were unable to locate the same video posted by @noash_a, we found another video of the same baby shared by him. This was tweeted as a reply to a user who shared the clip of the baby in a duffle bag and demanded that the \u2018perpetrator\u2019 be punished. @noash_a replied, \u201cThis is the same child who is active and this is his father enjoying his time in the desert and you stay on Twitter and no one notices or reads anything about you.\u201d (Translated from Arabic.)\n\nA comparison of the facial features of the baby reveals that s/he is the same child.\n\nGiven below is the sequence of events observed by Alt News:\n\n1. The video was first shared with an Arabic caption. This was between October 28 and 29, 2018. @noash_a seems to be the creator of the video. The fact that he uploaded another clip of the baby suggests that he might not be a stranger to the child.\n\n2. The video was subsequently shared with a completely different narrative on October 31, 2018. Here, an Arabic page on Facebook claimed that the video represents a Filipino maid kidnapping a baby. However, the second part of the video which shows the alleged woman was not shot at the same location. From what it seems, two different clips were merged to support the claim.\n\n3. From the next month onwards, i.e., November 2018, the video began to be shared with the \u2018Pakistani baby kidnapped and taken to Dubai\u2019 claim. It is still circulating with the same narrative.\n\nWhile it cannot be conclusively established if the video was created in jest or it depicts an actual incident, there is little doubt that the \u2018Pakistan-Dubai\u2019 claim is flimsy. Media outlets that ran stories on the video, based their reports on old and unverified footage which was tweeted by HGS Dhaliwal, the Executive Director of Security at the Airport Authority of India.", "lang": "en"}
