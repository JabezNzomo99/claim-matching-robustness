No, that's not true, even though a fake news site pretending to be the New York Times is claiming he did. None of it is true.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on nytiwes.com (not nytimes.com) on titled \"Pope Francis Steps Down Over Sexual Abuse Coverup\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe Pope has not confirmed the news via his Twitter account, nor is the official news website of the Vatican making any mention of it. No other legitimate sources are reporting it either, so it is pretty safe to say it is a big hoax.\n\nYou may also recall the nytiwes.com website recently posted a Demi Lovato death hoax that went massively viral:\n\nFake News: Singer And Actress Demi Lovato Has NOT Died At 25 | Lead Stories Did singer and actress Demi Lovato pass away aged 25 after a heroin overdose?
