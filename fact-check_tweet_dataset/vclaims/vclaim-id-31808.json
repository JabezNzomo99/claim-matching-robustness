No, that's not true: it will get you $91.25 despite what a viral image says.\n\nAn example of the image can be seen in this post (archived here) where it was published on May 27, 2019 with a text that read \"New savings plan!\". The image shows a jar of coins under a caption that reads:\n\nDon't quit your day job just yet if you believed that. If you multiply the number of years in a day (365) by 0.25 you only get 91.25. During a leap year you could add another quarter to that and you'd save a whopping $91.50.\n\nUsing this method it would take you about 100 years to reach $9,125 (assuming you kept the money in a jar and didn't put it into any type of intrest-earning account).\n\nHere is the image in question:\n\nDon't get taken in by bad math!", "lang": "en"}
