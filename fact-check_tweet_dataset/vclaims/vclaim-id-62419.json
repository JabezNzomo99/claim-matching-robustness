So have we. We want to help you sort out the facts from the dramatic liberties. (We've also fact-checked BlacKkKlansman, The Post, Darkest Hour and Dunkirk.)\n\nThe smash-hit Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" is making its move to the TV screen, bringing Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s hip-hop biography of Alexander Hamilton to a new audience.\n\nThe tale of the \"$10 Founding Father without a father\" has inspired years of sell-out crowds at theaters across the country. The show, which Miranda famously began writing after reading Ron Chernow\u2019s biography, chronicles Hamilton\u2019s ascension to the forefront of American history.\n\nThe show is startlingly faithful to Hamilton\u2019s life. It draws heavily \u2014 and sometimes verbatim \u2014 from his writings. But some events are transposed in time, some characters take on roles played by others in real life, and some details have been changed for dramatic license.\n\nThe biggest controversy we found among historians is a debate over whether Miranda\u2019s \"Hamilton\" is too kind to its protagonist.\n\nMiranda has often described his work as \"the story of America then, told by America now.\" But even some scholars who say they admire Miranda\u2019s multiracial cast \u2014 and the catchy songs they sing \u2014 have weighed in on whether the play\u2019s largely heroic portrayal of Hamilton is accurate.\n\nAt the least, the musical has got people talking about Hamilton, his legacy and the revolutionary era. That conversation is bound to continue as the Broadway hit migrates to the TV screen and becomes available on Disney+ beginning July 3.\n\n\"\u2018Hamilton\u2019 the musical should not be taken as the last word on these topics, and certainly not as the only word,\" said Todd Estes, professor of history at Oakland University. \"But if the musical were the only perspective on the events of Hamilton's career that most people got, the version portrayed on stage is actually pretty good and could be a lot worse.\"\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve compiled a non-exhaustive list of inaccuracies in \"Hamilton,\" big and small. (We reached out to Miranda and Chernow but did not hear back.)\n\nOn race and Hamilton\u2019s position toward slavery\n\nSome historians say Miranda\u2019s musical inflates Hamilton\u2019s antislavery credentials, painting him as a \"revolutionary manumission abolitionist\" when, they say, he was less progressive on the issue of slavery in real life.\n\n\"It is great theater and bad history,\" said David Waldstreicher, a historian at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York, who argued in one of a collection of essays on \"Hamilton\" that the musical is part of a movement that over-glorifies the Founding Fathers.\n\nThe musical\u2019s Hamilton celebrates John Laurens\u2019 dream of building \"the first Black battalion\" and says, \"We\u2019ll never be free until we end slavery.\" Hamilton\u2019s wife, Elizabeth Schuyler, says in the play's final song that he \"could have done so much more\" toward ending slavery had he lived longer.\n\nIn reality, Hamilton may not have been as ardent an abolitionist as the play makes him out to be. He was a founder of the New York Manumission Society, an anti-slavery group, but he did not seriously propose the total abolition of slavery, said Michael Newton, a historian and author of several books on Hamilton and the founding era.\n\n\"The most important error is the flat-out exaggeration of abolitionism,\" Waldstreicher said. In his essay, co-authored by the University of Missouri\u2019s Jeffrey Pasley, Waldstreicher wrote that the real-life Hamilton \"wasn\u2019t an antislavery activist or a \u2018revolutionary\u2019 in that sense.\"\n\nHamilton propped up several Federalist slaveholders as presidential candidates, Waldstreicher and Pasley wrote. Other historians noted that Hamilton\u2019s father-in-law owned slaves, and that Hamilton may have owned at least two slaves himself.\n\nWhen slavery and race do come up in the musical, they do so \"primarily to establish Hamilton\u2019s \u2018goodness\u2019 for modern audiences,\" said Harvard University\u2019s Annette Gordon-Reed in an essay for the National Council on Public History.\n\nGordon-Reed, who said she loved the musical and regularly listens to its soundtrack, was responding to an essay in the journal The Public Historian by Lyra D. Montiero, an assistant professor of American studies and history at Rutgers University, Newark.\n\nMontiero took issue with Miranda\u2019s decision to employ a predominantly Black and Latino cast, a move that has drawn both praise and criticism. The casting, she wrote, covers up for the fact that the \"role of people of color in the Revolution itself is silenced.\"\n\n\"Despite the proliferation of Black and brown bodies onstage, not a single enslaved or free person of color exists as a character in this play,\" she wrote. There\u2019s one exception, she noted: a chorus member briefly assumes the role of Sally Hemings, the biracial woman born into slavery under Thomas Jefferson who is believed to have had a sexual relationship with him.\n\nChernow, who described Hamilton as an \"uncompromising abolitionist\" in his biography, told the New York Times that the casting itself effectively writes non-white people into the Founding Fathers\u2019 story. Daveed Diggs, who plays both Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette, said he \"walked out of the show with a sense of ownership over American history.\"\n\nHistorians like Montiero have argued that the play could have also featured the \"thousands of people of color (who) participated in the war\" as soldiers, groomsmen and in other capacities. It omits the stories of Crispus Attucks, the Black man killed during the Boston Massacre, and Cato, who was born into slavery but worked as an anti-British spy alongside Hamilton\u2019s friend Hercules Mulligan.\n\nHamilton\u2019s decision to publish an explainer detailing his affair with Maria Reynolds is a turning point in the musical \u2014 and based on a real historical event. The musical quotes directly from the actual \"Reynolds Pamphlet,\" with some language updated for clarity.\n\nAs in the play, the real-life Hamilton confessed to three men that he was guilty not of illegal financial speculation, but of paying hush money to James Reynolds, who extorted Hamilton under threat of publicizing the affair.\n\nBut in reality, it wasn\u2019t Jefferson, Aaron Burr and James Madison who confronted Hamilton. It was House Speaker Frederick Muhlenberg, Rep. Abraham Venable of Virginia and future President James Monroe.\n\nHamilton released the tell-all \"Reynolds Pamphlet\" years later, after a journalist published details of the affair and made accusations of what he, too, suspected was illegal speculation.\n\nIn the musical, Hamilton\u2019s revelations prompt his wife Elizabeth Schuyler to sing about burning her letters in order to \"let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart.\"\n\nChernow didn\u2019t explicitly connect the lack of letters from Schuyler to the Reynolds Pamphlet. He wrote in his biography that she \"apparently destroyed her own letters and tried to expunge her presence from the history books,\" but he didn't say when she got rid of them or why.\n\nIn \"Hamilton: The Revolution,\" a book Miranda co-authored about the musical, he said he had \"enormous freedom\" with this scene because \"Eliza\u2019s response is lost in time.\"\n\nOn Thomas Jefferson and other Founding Fathers\n\nDaveed Diggs performs as Thomas Jefferson in \"Hamilton,\" the filmed version of the Broadway musical. (Disney+)\u200b\n\nJefferson is believed to have been more mild-tempered than \"Hamilton\" lets on \u2014 a writer more than a speaker. The musical alters some events to paint him as a foil to Hamilton.\n\nBetween Jefferson\u2019s return anthem \"What Did I Miss?\" and Hamilton\u2019s claim in \"Cabinet Battle #1\" that \"we almost died in a trench while you were off getting high with the French,\" the musical gives the impression that Jefferson waited out the Revolutionary War overseas.\n\nJefferson did not fight in the war as a soldier. He was selected as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress in 1775 and helped draft the Declaration of Independence for adoption in 1776. He served as governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1784 that Jefferson left for Europe, where he eventually replaced Benjamin Franklin as the U.S. minister to France.\n\nJefferson didn\u2019t step down as secretary of state \"so he (could) run for president,\" either, despite what President George Washington\u2019s character says in \"One Last Time.\"\n\nIn reality, he resigned in 1793, three years before the 1796 election, when he was elected vice president.\n\nThe musical\u2019s reduction of Madison to a Jefferson sidekick also results in a portrayal that is \"greatly distorted,\" said Estes, the Oakland University professor.\n\n\"In actuality, Madison was a giant,\" Estes said. \"Madison was absolutely an equal partner with Jefferson and stood on the same level of historical significance as Hamilton and Jefferson.\"\n\nOn the election of 1800\n\nThe musical\u2019s rivalry between Hamilton and Burr peaks after the election of 1800. Hamilton sways the delegates to elect Jefferson with a late, tie-breaking \"endorsement\" that lifts Jefferson over Burr \"in a landslide\" and inspires Burr to challenge Hamilton to a duel.\n\nIn reality, however, Jefferson did not win solely because of Hamilton, nor was it a landslide.\n\nThe election of 1800 saw the Democratic-Republican Party push Jefferson for president and Burr for vice president in a bid to unseat President John Adams. The voting process was different back then. Electors in the Electoral College got two votes. The recipient of the most votes would become president, and the runner-up would become vice president.\n\nJefferson and Burr received the same number of votes, resulting in a tie that sent the decision to the House of Representatives. Hamilton lobbied the House Federalists to back Jefferson, but he wasn\u2019t the deciding \"vote,\" as the musical suggests.\n\n\"James Bayard of Delaware is the only person who had that kind of influence, and he didn't listen to Hamilton,\" wrote Nancy Isenberg, professor of history at Louisiana State University, in a journal article that called Miranda\u2019s depiction of the election \"distorted beyond recognition.\"\n\nIt also wasn\u2019t the so-called \"endorsement\" that inspired the Hamilton-Burr duel. According to the National Archives, Burr challenged Hamilton after Hamilton campaigned and allegedly made disparaging remarks against him during Burr\u2019s run to become New York\u2019s governor in 1804.\n\nThe two did sign their letters \"A.Hamilton\" and \"A.Burr.\"\n\nPhillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton, Renee Elise Goldsberry as Angelica Schuyler and Jasmine Cephas Jones as Peggy Schuyler in \"Hamilton,\" the filmed version of the Broadway musical. (Disney+)\n\nFact-check: Hamilton\u2019s character describes punching the person who \"handles the financials\" at Princeton. But in his book on the musical, Miranda said the line was a \"historical leap\" that made for a good rhyme. The real-life Hamilton had a disagreement with Princeton\u2019s president over his desire to graduate early, according to Chernow\u2019s biography.\n\nMiranda also wrote that the dialogue between Hamilton and Burr was a \"fictional first meeting.\" Other characters in the scene, including the Marquis de Lafayette, could not have met Hamilton that early. \"Lafayette was not in America when Hamilton arrived,\" Newton, the Hamilton historian, said.\n\nAaron Burr: \"Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him.\"\n\nFact-check: The tomcat story suggests that Hamilton was a womanizer. It appears in multiple biographies, according to the Associated Press. But the story is actually in dispute.\n\nMiranda wrote in his book on the musical that it was \"most likely a tale spread by John Adams later in life,\" while Newton traced it to a satirical letter written by someone identified as Captain Smythe.\n\nAngelica Schuyler: \"My father has no sons so I\u2019m the one who has to social climb for one.\"\n\nFact-check: Angelica Schuyler Church had several brothers, a fact that Miranda has since said he \"forgot\" while writing the musical. She was also married by the time that Hamilton came into her life, although the two did exchange frequent letters.\n\nFact-check: An American \"code duello\" did exist, according to PBS\u2019s American Experience. But the 1777 code had more than 10 rules \u2014 it had 25. Miranda wrote in a Genius annotation that he was inspired by \"Ten Crack Commandments,\" a rap song by the Notorious B.I.G.\n\nMiranda also altered other details of the duels depicted in \"Hamilton.\" For example, Burr was not present during the duel between Laurens and Charles Lee, according to an account by Hamilton and Maj. Evan Edwards, Lee\u2019s second. It\u2019s also not clear that Washington was as upset by the duel as the musical shows.\n\nAaron Burr: \"Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!\"\n\nFact-check: Hamilton did speak for roughly six hours at the Constitutional Convention, and he did propose \"his own form of government,\" as the musical says.\n\nThe missing context is that \"Hamilton famously advocated a monarchy in a speech his colleagues admired but ignored,\" Waldstreicher and Pasley wrote in their essay.\n\nGenerally speaking, Hamilton had a \"serious anti-democratic bent\" that was \"played down\" in the musical, Estes said. \"The immigrant trope is used to help make Hamilton more a \u2018man of the people\u2019 than he ever was historically,\" he said.\n\nAlexander Hamilton: \"Do you support this Constitution? \u2026 Then defend it.\"\n\nFact-check: There\u2019s no evidence that Hamilton invited Burr to contribute to the Federalist Papers, a series of essays arguing in support of the U.S. Constitution. In Miranda\u2019s book on the musical, he wrote that this was a \"fictional scene.\" Only Madison and John Jay contributed to the effort, while Gouvernuer Morris declined Hamilton\u2019s invitation to join it.\n\nThomas Jefferson: \"If New York\u2019s in debt, why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I\u2019m afraid. Don\u2019t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade.\"\n\nFact-check: It\u2019s not true that the Southern states had paid off all their post-war debts when Hamilton proposed a plan to let the federal government assume them. The funding act passed as part of the Compromise of 1790 authorized the assumption of $21.5 million in debts that were owed by all 13 states, including the Southern states.\n\nFact-check: Hamilton resigned as Treasury Secretary in 1795, before Adams became president. Adams took over the presidency two years later, in 1797. Hamilton blasted Adams in a letter dated Oct. 24, 1800.\n\nAlexander Hamilton: \"I have never agreed with Jefferson once.\"\n\nFact-check: Hamilton and Jefferson agreed on some things, such as the establishment of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Along with Madison, the two famously struck a deal over dinner that led to the Compromise of 1790. Jefferson and Madison agreed to let the federal government assume state debts in exchange for moving the capital to Washington, D.C. The dinner is detailed in the musical\u2019s \"The Room Where it Happens.\"", "lang": "en"}
