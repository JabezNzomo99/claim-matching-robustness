He points to his Jan. 31 decision (effective on Feb. 2) to impose some travel restrictions on non-U.S. citizens coming from China \u2014 and contrasts that with a visit Pelosi made to San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown.\n\nOf course, Chinatown is not China. And there are many things Trump keeps getting wrong about her visit. It was pretty uneventful, but he tries to spice it up with claims that she called for a \u201cbig parade,\u201d a \u201cstreet party,\u201d a \u201cstreet fair\u201d and so forth. Then he tosses in some ridiculously false claims.\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated remarks dismissing the threat of the coronavirus to the United States have proved to be a problem for his reelection campaign. A president sets the national tone. But, to be fair, other high-profile politicians also did not express early alarm or advocate the extreme social distancing tactics now set in most of the country.\n\nPelosi visited San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown on Feb. 24. To view videos of her visits two months later is almost jarring, as she strolls arm-in-arm and walks amid a crowd. She made clear the point of her visit was to show it was \u201cvery safe to be in Chinatown,\u201d which had been hit hard by a drop in tourism after reports of the virus emerging from China.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for any other country,\u201d she added, though she also said: \u201cI do think that because it started in China, there\u2019s a concern that are the \u2014 is the Chinese government doing what it needed to do early enough, and now as we go forward. But that should not be carried over to Chinatown and San Francisco.\u201d\n\nAsked whether she had confidence in the federal government, Pelosi did not mention Trump but said she had confidence in Anthony S. Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. \u201cPrevention, prevention, prevention,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want people to be concerned and vigilant. However, we don\u2019t want them to be afraid.\u201d\n\nChinatown, in fact, had no covid-19 cases as of mid-April in its 22 blocks, according to a report published by the New York Times. \u201cDespite being particularly vulnerable to the novel coronavirus in the United States, Chinatown turned out to be well-prepared, unlike other places around the country,\u201d the article said, citing a community plan of action that was put in place on Feb. 1, emphasizing frequent hand-cleaning, availability of sanitizers and education on basic hygiene principles, including frequent use of masks.\n\nTrump compared the coronavirus to the seasonal flu. \u201cIt is a little bit different, but in some ways it\u2019s easier and in some ways it\u2019s a little bit tougher,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have it so well under control. I mean, we really have done a very good job.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do an accounting here. Trump claimed Pelosi deleted a tweet; that\u2019s false. There was no such tweet, and her tweet of her visit is still on her timeline. He accused her of causing many deaths, when there have been none in Chinatown and relatively few in San Francisco. He says she urged street fairs and parades, but that\u2019s not true. She advocated patronage of Chinese businesses.\n\nIn terms of suggesting he took the crisis seriously and she did not, that\u2019s a stretch. Contrary to Trump\u2019s claim, she never suggested the virus did not exist. In Chinatown, she urged people to take precautions and to be vigilant. A day later, she called for a broader, more forceful response. The president, meanwhile, continued with happy talk for at least two weeks afterward.", "lang": "en"}
