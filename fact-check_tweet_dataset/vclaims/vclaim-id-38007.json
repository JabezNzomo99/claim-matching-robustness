It has been edited to show Mr Starmer not answering a question when he actually did.\n\nThroughout the clip, Mr Starmer explains Labour\u2019s policy to renegotiate a withdrawal agreement with the EU and hold a referendum asking the public whether they want to leave on the basis of that deal or remain in the EU. Whether you think his responses equate to \u2018not answering the question\u2019 as the Facebook posts claim is a matter of opinion.\n\nBut there is one part of the video that is misleading. In the video, originally shared by the Conservative party\u2019s Twitter account, Mr Starmer appears to be unable to respond at the end of the clip when asked by Piers Morgan \u201cWhy would the EU give you a good deal if they know that you\u2019re going to actively campaign against it?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe video has been edited and inaccurately portrays what actually happened. As we outline here, Mr Starmer actually replied to the question posed at the end by Mr Morgan. The footage seemingly showing Mr Starmer apparently being unable to answer the question appears to have been taken from earlier on in the interview when he was listening to a question.", "lang": "en"}
