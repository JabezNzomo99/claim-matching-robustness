No, that's not true: the story was invented by a satirical website as a criticism of the policy of separately locking up the children of families who crossed the U.S. border illegally and then applied for asylum afterwards. The Statue of Liberty part is not true, the rest is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on June 19, 2018 titled \"Statue Of Liberty Converted Into Prison For Immigrant Children\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nQUICK THINKING US Government officials have found a solution to the growing problem of finding somewhere to intern immigrant children who have been purposefully separated from their parents by US border officials, WWN can reveal.
