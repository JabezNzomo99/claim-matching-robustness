Alt News has decided to keep a daily track of such fake messages flooding social media. Today, we chronice the fake statements attributed to celebrities which includes two movie stars, a journalist and two politicians.\n\nA quote attributed to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says, \u201cIf Narendra Modi becomes PM again in 2019, India will soon become a developed nation\u201d. This quote has been posted by the Facebook page I support Modi ji and BJP which has more than 340,000 followers. The quote was uploaded on March 21 and has been shared more than 600 times already.\n\nWe support Amit Shah is a Facebook page with more than 200,000 followers. It has claimed that actor Akshay Kumar in his meeting with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had asked the latter to allow the Indian army a free hand in dealing with stone pelters. This message was posted along with a picture of the actor with Rajnath Singh, on March 21. It has been shared more than 1100 times at the time of writing.\n\nThe claim attributed to the actor is fake. Akshay Kumar has met the Union Home Minister on more than one occasion, but there has not been a single report stating what has been claimed in the post above.\n\n\u201cPM Modi is the kind of politician who knows the path, walks on it himself and shows others the way\u201d (translated). These are the words attributed to actor Anil Kapoor and has been posted by the Facebook page Modi Express.\n\nModi Express has close to 350,000 followers and the above fake quote has been shared almost 300 times.\n\nThe following quotes are by parody accounts which are construed to be true and often shared widely on social media.\n\nA quote attributed to BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra in which he ridicules former cricketer and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu for having criticised former PM Manmohan Singh earlier and doing a complete about-turn after he joined the Congress party.\n\nThe quote was posted by the Facebook page We Support Amit Shah. It is from the handle @sambit_swaraj which is NOT the official Twitter account of Sambit Patra. Original accounts are accompanied by a blue tick which distinguish them from fake accounts. The official account of Patra can be accessed here.\n\n\u2018Every Government has limitations, but looking at the hate for Narendra Modi by anti-national forces, we are even more determined to stand by Modi ji\u201d (translated). This is the statement ascribed to Sweta Singh who is Executive Editor, Programming with Aaj Tak. The quote has been posted by the page Modi Mania which has more than 180,000 followers.\n\nThe above quote has been shared over 1300 times. The handle of the account reads @TheSwetaSinghAT which again is not the original account of the anchor. Sweta Singh\u2019s account goes by the handle @SwetaSinghAT and can be accessed here. It can be seen that no such message has been tweeted by her.", "lang": "en"}
