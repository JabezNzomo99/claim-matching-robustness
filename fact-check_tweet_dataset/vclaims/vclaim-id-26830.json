When viewed on YouTube, the video continues to play but shows a snake graphic instead of the rest of the report.\n\nThe websites were sharing a video titled, \"24 Oras Student Teacher, pinatay at ginahasa\" (24 Oras Student Teacher, killed and raped) on the channel Virals Feed. It was uploaded on October 25 and has 988,607 views as of writing.", "lang": "en"}
