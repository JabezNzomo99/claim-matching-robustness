Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Referring to Vukmir, she said:\n\n\"You know, my opponent backed that plan, where 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of individuals and large multinational corporations on the corporate side.\"\n\nIs the GOP-backed law that favorable to the rich?\n\nOur colleagues have three times rated as Half True claims that are similar to Baldwin\u2019s. Each claim cited an analysis of the tax law by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.\n\nThe analysis found that by 2027, the law would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum.\n\nHowever, in earlier years, the distribution of benefits would look very different, as PolitiFact National reported:\n\nFor instance, in 2018, according to the center\u2019s analysis, the bill would deliver 20.5 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent \u2014 vastly less than the 83 percent figure the DNC touted.\n\nAnd as late as 2025, the center projected, 25.3 percent of the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent.\n\nThe main reason: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions that benefit middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless Congress extends them. In addition, the new tax law changed how inflation was calculated, in a way that will be less generous to taxpayers as time goes on.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s statement is slightly different in that she refers not only to the top 1 percent of individuals but also large multinational corporations as enjoying 83 percent of the benefits of the law. But she, too, relies on the Tax Policy Center\u2019s analysis.\n\nAs it turns out, Baldwin\u2019s phrasing doesn\u2019t really make her claim materially different than the similar ones we\u2019ve fact checked \u2014 at least with regard to how the analysis that she relies on was done.\n\nJoseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, told us: \"Corporations legally pay taxes. But a corporation is just an entity that is truly owned by individuals who bear the economic burden of the tax.\"\n\nKyle Pomerleau, an economist with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, had a similar take. He told us: \"When thinking about the distributional impact of tax changes, you should only look at how it ultimately affects people, as corporations are little pieces of paper in a filing cabinet somewhere \u2014 they can\u2019t really feel the burden of any tax.\"\n\nIn other words, despite the variation in phrasing, Baldwin\u2019s statement isn\u2019t any more accurate than the previous statements we\u2019ve checked.\n\nBaldwin says that under the Republican tax reform law, \"83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of individuals and large multinational corporations.\"\n\nEven though her statement mentions corporations, it isn\u2019t materially different than three similar statements we\u2019ve checked.\n\nIn a nutshell, the analysis that all four statements rely on found that by 2027, the law would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum. However, in earlier years, the distribution of benefits would look very different, with much smaller percentages of the benefits \u2014 20 to 25 percent \u2014 going to the top 1 percent.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details \u2014 our definition of Half True.", "lang": "en"}
