A lot of people were against it. They said, isn\u2019t that terrible. Countries that have crime rates that are so high, you wouldn\u2019t even believe it\u2019s possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don\u2019t take people from those countries, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nTrump has offered no evidence to back up his claim \u2014 and the White House did not respond to a request for comment \u2014 but his statements are now problematic in the wake of the deadly shooting rampage at a Navy flight school in Pensacola, Fla., by a Saudi military student, Ahmed Mohammed al-Shamrani.\n\nTrump\u2019s travel ban covers these countries: Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. (Chad was originally on the list but was removed in 2018 after the White House said the country improved security measures; Iraq and Sudan had been on earlier versions but not the one that passed muster with the Supreme Court.) So that means Saudi Arabia would not be covered.\n\nThe travel ban essentially halted the issuance of immigrant visas to the affected countries and restricted certain types of nonimmigrant visas, such as for tourism and business, though it varied from country to country. (The ban on business visas for Venezuela was limited to government officials and immediate family members, for instance.)\n\nShamrani held one of more than 5,500 temporary visas issued to Saudi military personnel by the State Department in 2019, according to department data. As of Friday, there were 852 Saudis in the United States for Pentagon-sponsored training related to security cooperation.\n\nHere\u2019s how nonimmigrant visas for Saudis in 2016, 2017 and 2018 compare with countries on the travel ban list, according to the State Department. Note that although Trump in his rallies suggests no one from the countries on the list can enter the country, the numbers are down, but not to zero. Saudi citizens have received more visas over the past two years than the travel-ban countries combined.\n\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked at various times Trump administration claims that most terrorist attacks in the United States are committed by foreign-born people or that the administration blocked more than 3,000 \u201cknown or suspected terrorists\u201d from entering the country. Those claims fell apart under scrutiny.\n\nThe FBI has said it presumed the shooting was terrorism. \u201cWe are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, working with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,\u201d said Rachel Rojas, special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Jacksonville division.\n\nTrump, when he was still a private citizen, criticized the Obama administration for initially saying the Fort Hood shooting rampage by Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan that killed 13 was \u201cworkplace violence.\u201d (It took President Barack Obama six years to concede it was a terrorist attack.) Hasan, however, was born in the United States; his parents were Palestinian immigrants.\n\nCNN reported on Oct. 31 that the Trump administration is considering adding more countries to the travel ban list. But Trump has given no indication that he intends to add Saudi Arabia, and in fact, he has rushed to relay that \u201cthey are devastated in Saudi Arabia\u201d and that \u201cthe king will be involved in taking care of families and loved ones.\u201d\n\nBut the attack shows the limits of Trump\u2019s travel ban. We will be watching to see whether the president repeats his claims about it at his next rally.", "lang": "en"}
