The caption, roughly translated from Spanish, reads, \u201cJoe Biden did not expect this photo to exist, nothing is hidden under the sun: Jill Biden had a meeting with Fidel Castro in Cuba under the Obama administration!\u201d\n\nBut the woman pictured is not Jill Biden. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller News Foundation found the photo in a 2016 Facebook post from the Kon-Tiki Museum, a museum dedicated to the life of Heyerdahl, a late Norwegian explorer. The post identifies the two people with Castro as Heyerdahl and Beer, Heyerdahl\u2019s wife and a French actress.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that this photo shows Jacqueline Beer to the right (widow of the late Thor Heyerdahl, 1914-2002 and living in Tenerife, Spain), Fidel Castro in the middle, and Thor Heyerdahl on the left,\u201d said Martin Biehl, director of the museum, in an email to the DCNF.\n\n\u201cThis is not Jill Biden,\u201d Rosemary Boeglin, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, also confirmed in an email to the DCNF.

Castro retired from the presidency in 2008, according to The New York Times.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
