This video is an excerpt from the 1946 post-war film \u201cNo Leave, No Love,\u201d starring Van Johnson, Keenan Wynn, and Pat Kirkwood, and the piano-playing wunderkind featured in the movie is Frank \u201cSugar Chile\u201d Robinson:\n\nFrank was tiny when he showed unusual gifts for singing the blues and playing the piano.

Naturally, he was in great demand to record and perform.\n\nIn fact, Robinson was just seven years old when he appeared in \u201cNo Leave, No Love.\u201d Here\u2019s a better and more complete version of his sequence in that film, playing a popular piece of the time known as \u201cCaldonia\u201d (or \u201cCaldonia Boogie\u201d):", "lang": "en"}
