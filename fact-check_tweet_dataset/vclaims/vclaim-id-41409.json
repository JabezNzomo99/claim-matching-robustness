The claim is false; the video has circulated online in reports about two Muslims who were attacked during a quarrel with their Muslim neighbours; Lucknow police told AFP the row involved two Muslim families; the victim of the attack told AFP that both he, his sister, and their attackers were Muslim.\n\nThe 45-second video was published here in a Facebook post on June 25, 2019.\n\nIt was viewed more than 1.2 million times and shared more than 34,000 times before it was deleted.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Hindi language caption translates to English as: \u201c#Lucknow, this incident took place in Itaunja police station area yesterday. Islam and four other men from the peace-loving community tried to rape his sister and beat them badly when he stopped them from doing so. #Wake up Hindu wake-up, your end is certain. And the police could have taken them to the hospital, but see the apathy of our country's administration.\"\n\nA bleeding man can be seen holding a bleeding woman girl in his arms. He can be heard saying in Hindi, \u201cWhy are you not listening to me, I want you to register my complaint first.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee the situation of her, our family members are dying. Please send the police to my home. Islam and Yunus attacked us with two other people and my sister is dying,\u201d the man in the video says when asked about the incident.\n\nA male voice can be heard suggesting that the pair seek medical treatment first and then bring a written complaint to the police.\n\nThe same video has also been viewed hundreds of thousands of times after being shared on Facebook here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nIt has also been shared on Twitter, for example here and here, with a similar claim.\n\nThe video originally circulated online in connection with reports about two Muslims who were attacked during a quarrel with their Muslim neighbors.\n\nA keyword search found a longer version of the video published here on Twitter by journalist Rishabh Mani, who states on his profile that he works for Hindi language news channel NEWS 18.\n\nThe 50-second video in Mani\u2019s tweet contains an additional five seconds of footage at the beginning of the clip.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the video tweeted by Mani (R):\n\nA Hindi language caption on Mani\u2019s tweet translates to English as: \u201cShahrukh took blood-soaked sister to the capital\u2019s Mahngwa police check-post of Itaunja Police Station Area.

We have registered a complaint and four people have been arrested in the case,\" he said.\n\nIn this tweet on June 25, 2019, Lucknow Police said they had registered a case over the incident and that a constable had been disciplined.\n\nThe tweet says: \"SSP-LKO #Kalanidhi_Naithani has taken speedy action over the case in Intaujha Police Station Area. (CO) Circle Office BKT (Bakshi Ka Talab) told us that constable Rahul, batch 16, district Baghpat, was posted at the police check-post. He has been summoned to the police headquarters for behaving in an inhuman way.\"\n\nLucknow Police issued a further clarification about the video here on Twitter on June 25.\n\nThe Hindi language tweet translates to English as: \u201cTwo parties from the same community (Muslim) began to fight over some issue while kids/youths were playing in front of a house in Intaujha Police Station area.

My mother Sabiri and sister Shabnam separated them, but Altaf's family members, including Islam, Yunus, Shakeel, and Usman along with other residents of village Nrausa of Intauja Police Station in district Lucknow, came and attacked my sister Shabnam with batons, sticks and iron rods. My sister fainted after a while, but they kept beating her.\"\n\nWhen I intervened they started abusing and beating me and also threatened to kill me. When my other family members came to my rescue, upon seeing them coming, all the attackers ran away. I have come with my sister here to make a complaint and request to take legal action against them.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the police complaint:\n\nShahrukh said the claims about the video on social media were not true.\n\nIn a telephone interview on July 1, he told AFP: \u201cBoth me, my sister and our attackers are Muslims. We had skirmishes in the past over different issues, but we had never thought that they will attack us so brutally.\"", "lang": "en"}
