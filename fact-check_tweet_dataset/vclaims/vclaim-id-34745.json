However, there is no evidence that he actually spoke or wrote these words.\n\nThe Thomas Jefferson Foundation found no record of the saying in Jefferson\u2019s collected writings, listing it as a \u201cspurious quotation\u201d on its website. It has been falsely attributed to the nation\u2019s third president since at least 2002, according to etymologist Barry Popik.\n\n\u201c\u2018Democracy is mob rule\u2019 was not said by the founding fathers of the United States, although they did make some similar critical comments about pure democracy,\u201d he wrote in a blog post.\n\nA similar phrase appeared in the writings of the Greek historian Polybius. A more modern variation reads, \u201cDemocracy is mob rule, but with income taxes.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
