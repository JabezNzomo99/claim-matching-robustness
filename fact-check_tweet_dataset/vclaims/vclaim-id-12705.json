Her full statement:\n\n\u201cAfter the murder of [former DNR leader] Alexander Zakharchenko under the conditions of a possible vacuum of power, there was a real risk of the total destabilization of the situation in southeastern Ukraine. This, against the backdrop of the trade and economic blockade imposed by Kyiv and the constant threat of the use of force coming from the Ukrainian leadership, could have negatively affected life in the Donbas and the settlement process in general. The holding of elections made it possible to avoid such a scenario.\u201d\n\nBut her claims of stability comes amid reports of 16 attacks on Ukrainian army positions in eastern Ukraine over a 24-hour period on November 15 and 16, leaving two soldiers wounded. The press center of Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation also said \u201cthree occupiers\u201d were killed and another five were wounded.\n\nRussia claims the catalyst for a potential political vacuum was the murky assassination of former DNR head Aleksandr Zakharchenko. Mirroring Zakharova\u2019s language, Russian President Vladimir Putin said those who carried out the murder were \u201cmaking a dangerous bet on the destabilization of the situation\u201d in the Donbas.\n\nBut writing for Spiegel Online, Christian Neef argued there is now a \u201cbroad consensus\u201d that Zakharchenko was killed either by Russian security forces or by people from within his own camp.\n\nRussian reports looking to pin blame on Kyiv have only served to raise more questions than answers.\n\nIn any case, violent transfers of power have become a common occurrence in the region.\n\nLike Pushilin, Pasechnik, previously LNR security minister, initially came to power not through democratic means: he became the LNR\u2019s acting leader after former LNR head Igor Plotnitsky fled to Russia following an armed putsch in November 2017.\n\nAs Spiegel Online\u2019s Neef noted, Igor Girkin, the onetime leader of the Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and former DNR defense minister, said \"bandits\" had taken power in both self-declared republics. Girkin also asserted that the Donbas is \"simply getting robbed.\"\n\n\u201cMany of the recent murders may have been part of a brutal battle for influence and riches,\u201d Neef wrote, adding that the markets and companies \"nationalized\" by Zakharchenko \u201care now being returned to their rightful owners.\u201d\n\n\u200bMeanwhile, the Jamestown Foundation\u2019s Vladimir Socor has argued that \u201cthe violent removal\u201d of Plotnitsky and Zakharchenko contributed to the holding of the November 11 elections, but were not the determining factor.\n\n\u201cThese were predictable and almost foreordained by the quadrennial \u2018electoral\u2019 cycle that the Kremlin and the DPR-LPR need to perpetuate in the occupied territory,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe \u2018republics\u2019 should at least pretend to observe some formal electoral procedures, and generate for their leaders at regular intervals the semblance of a popular mandate. This could strengthen their claim for acceptance de facto as negotiating parties (even short of formal recognition) and make it possible for Russia on the international level to portray its hand-picked proxies as emanations of the local population.\"\n\nUltimately, Russia itself has been pivotal in fomenting and perpetuating armed conflict in eastern Ukraine since the start of hostilities in 2014.\n\nAs Polygraph.info previously reported, there is abundant verifiable evidence of the presence of Russian military hardware, troops, intelligence agents, and economic aid from Russia in the Donbas conflict.\n\nPresident Putin himself once admitted to having some military personnel in the Donbas. Talking heads on Russia state media have similarly made an about-face and admitted the presence of Russian special services operating in eastern Ukraine, saying it would be \u201cstupid to deny that.\u201d\n\nZakharova is essentially arguing that a conflict for which Russia has served as both the impetus and fuel risks spiraling out of control because the previous two leaders in the Russian-occupied territories were violently ousted, potentially at the behest of Moscow and/or its proxies -- and that now the situation has stabilized because those who were already operating with impunity have been \u201clegitimized\u201d by elections that much of the Western world condemned as a sham.\n\nWhether or not the arguments that Russia had a hand in the violent transfers of power are true, Russia\u2019s violent military actions in Donetsk and Luhansk are the de-stabilizing force. And so we find that Zakharova\u2019s claim is false.", "lang": "en"}
