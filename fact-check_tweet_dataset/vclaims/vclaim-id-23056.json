However it\u2019s very unlikely, in practice, that the Brexit party would win so many seats at a general election. EU election results can\u2019t be used as a proxy for how people would vote in a general election.\n\nHow the figure is calculated\n\nThe Brexit Party won 31.6% of votes cast in Great Britain in the recent EU parliamentary elections. We don\u2019t know exactly how the Brexit party converted that figure into the number of seats it would win in at a general election, and have asked it for more information.\n\nBut one possibility is that they took the share of the vote won by each of the major parties, and ran them through the Electoral Calculus website.\n\nApplying those vote shares to the constituencies of the 2017 general election, the website estimates that the Brexit party would win 446 seats\u2014a majority of 242 seats overall.\n\nThis would be a landslide for the Brexit Party, wiping the Conservatives off the electoral map entirely, so they\u2019re left with no seats at all. Labour would have an estimated 93 seats, the SNP 56, and the Liberal Democrats 31.\n\nThe Electoral Calculus website is widely respected, and Martin Baxter, its founder and CEO, told us they use regression techniques to estimate the geographic spread of support for each party, and how this translates into seats won under the first past the post system. That said, it is, of course, an estimate based on modelling techniques, and no model is perfect. Many of these seats are also predicted to be marginals\u2014meaning they estimate that it would be close-run between at least two parties.\n\nProfessor Chris Hanretty, a political scientist at Royal Holloway University, produced a separate estimate of how the EU election vote shares would play out in a general election result. He too modelled a Brexit Party landslide (albeit a slightly smaller one), with the party probably winning 414 seats\u2014a majority of 178.\n\nThis vote share is very unlikely to come about at a general election\n\nHowever, Professor Hanretty emphasises in his analysis that the EU parliamentary election results tell us \u201calmost nothing\u201d about what would happen at a general election.\n\nHe goes on: \u201cI estimate that the Brexit party won the most votes in over four hundred Westminster constituencies. The Brexit Party will not win four hundred seats in a future general election.\u201d\n\nMartin Baxter, who runs Electoral Calculus, also told us it\u2019s very unlikely that the EU election results would be repeated at a general election.\n\nPeople don\u2019t necessarily vote the same way in EU elections as they do in a general election. For example, UKIP won 34% of the vote in Great Britain in the 2014 EU parliamentary elections, but only 13% of the vote in the UK-wide general election the following year.\n\nTurnout at the EU parliamentary elections was 37%, whereas general elections normally see a turnout of at least 60%. A much higher number of voters could well affect the results.\n\nPeople also might cast their vote based on different issues at a general election compared to an EU one. Polling by Lord Ashcroft shows that Brexit policy was the second-most important reason why voters supported the Brexit party and the most important reason why voters supported the Lib Dems (who between them received over 50% of votes).\n\nPriorities might differ in a general election. Polling on voting intention at a general elections shows support for the Conservatives and Labour at about 20-30% each in the last month or so (whereas they won 9% and 14% respectively in the EU parliamentary elections). The Brexit party has consistently been polling around 18-26% in the same period, and the Liberal Democrats around 10-20% in most cases.", "lang": "en"}
