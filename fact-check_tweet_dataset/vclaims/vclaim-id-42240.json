See the result.\" (Hindi text - \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u091c\u0935\u093e\u0928 \u092a\u0930 \u0917\u094b\u0932\u0940 \u091a\u0932\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0925\u093e \u092f\u0947 \u0907\u0902\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0926\u0947\u0916\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0906 )\n\nThe archived version of the post can be accesses here.\n\nThe post, shared widely from Facebook page Proud of Indian Army on January 8 this year, has over 41,000 shares. However, it has picked up on internet in the aftermath of the Pulwama incident where over 40 CRPF personnel were killed in a terrorist attack. The same video has also been shared from Facebook profile of Er Sharvan Patel.\n\nWhile the post is almost a month old, as many as 1600 of the 5300 comments on the post have been made in the past 24 hours. This means 30 per cent of the total comments were made in the last 24 hours, and but for few exceptions, almost all of them are 'Jai Hinds' or appeals to kill the armed man.\n\nThe post has been shared widely on Facebook in the last 24 hours.\n\nWhen BOOM broke the video into fragments and ran a reverse image search on few of the frames, we were directed to some pages which had the same video.\n\nThe videos, in almost all cases, had more or less similar captions. After running them through Google translator, we found the language to be Indonesian.\n\nMost of these captions, when translated, gave this message: Oh, God!! This young man challenged the TNI and saw what happened (sic)!!\n\nTentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI) or the Indonesian National Army is the military force of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nWhile it's not clear whether the video is a mock military drill or a foiled terrorist attack, one thing that holds clarity is that this viral video is not from India.", "lang": "en"}
