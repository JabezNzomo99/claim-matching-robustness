Similar claims about sunscreens causing cancer have also been published in other outlets such as Collective Evolution, Woked, The Truth Revolution, Real Farmacy, and have been trending this summer on social media. Despite the headline, the article never actually cites a study to support the claim that \u201csunscreen causes cancer\u201d.\n\nThe claim that \u201cthe sun doesn\u2019t harm us\u201d is false given that exposure to UV radiation from the sun is a well-known risk factor for various forms of skin cancer. Additionally, it cites only one study in support of this claim[1], without taking into account the many studies establishing the well-known link between exposure to UV radiation and skin cancer (these studies have been summed up in a review by Whiteman et al[2]).\n\nWhile the article\u2019s takeaway from the study by Lindqvist et al. is generally correct (i.e. an increased mortality linked to sun exposure avoidance was observed), it does not take into account the fact that southern Sweden does not receive as much sunlight as other parts of the world, as the editorial comment to the original research article pointed out[3]. The finding that reduced sun exposure leads to increased mortality may therefore only be applicable to areas that do not receive much sunlight to begin with. Therefore, a balance needs to be struck when attempting to receive adequate sun exposure for health \u2013 too much or too little sunlight could be harmful (although apparently in different ways).\n\nThe article is also correct in stating that sunscreen use may alter people\u2019s behavior by giving them a false sense of security, causing them to stay in the sun for prolonged periods of time. This was indeed observed in a study by Autier et al.[4], which concluded that \u201can increased ability to delay sun-induced skin erythemal reactions [i.e. skin reddening and sunburns] is sufficient to cause longer sun exposure\u201d. They also added that:\n\nThis still means that increased risk of skin cancer is caused by excessive exposure to the sun, as a result of the false sense of security from sunscreen use. The solution is not to stop using sunscreen, but to understand the need to exercise caution with sun exposure even when using sunscreen.\n\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in the United States has stated that \u201csunscreen does not cause skin cancer\u201d, and that regular use of sunscreen has been found to reduce the risk of skin cancer[5,6]. It has also stated that \u201cExposure to UV radiation is the main factor in developing skin cancer\u201d and that sunscreen helps protect against this risk factor, although some individuals carry a genetic predisposition for developing skin cancer, which sunscreen use cannot modify.\n\nA 2017 literature review by Young et al. reaffirms the benefits of sunscreen use[7]:\n\nRegarding the potential adverse health effects of sunscreens, a 2011 meta-analysis by Burnett and Wang concluded that[8]:\n\nA 2019 study by Matta et al. does indicate that certain sunscreen ingredients can be absorbed into the bloodstream at levels qualifying them for toxicology assessment[9]. Whether these findings have any clinical significance still requires further research, although the authors have emphasized that \u201c[these] results do not indicate that individuals should refrain from the use of sunscreen.\u201d\n\nScience-Based Medicine covered a similar issue on sunscreen and skin cancer, with particular focus on claims made by Elizabeth Plourde, who is also quoted in the article reviewed here.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Lindqvist et al.
