{"title": "Russia Says Its Election Turnout 'Higher Than European Average'", "subtitle": "A Kremlin spokesman has claimed past voter turnout figures from most European countries are lower than those from Russia\u2019s own recent elections. Not counting elections to the European Parliament, more people on average go to the polls in most of the EU than cast ballots to the Duma on September 18 in Russia.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "September 21, 2016", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-18244", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-elections-turnout-/28088712.html", "vclaim": "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claims Russia's recent election turnout of 47.81%, as reported by Central Elections Chair Ella Pamfilova, is higher than figures from past elections in most European countries. While Peskov doesn\u2019t specify which elections he\u2019s referring to, his statement is only partly true if turnout in EU countries for national elections versus elections to the European Parliament is analyzed.\n\nTo be sure, the total turnout for the 2014 elections to the European Parliament was 42.61%, lower than Russia's official count for its own parliamentary elections.\n\nOf 28 countries that voted in the European parliamentary elections, 19 countries had turnout less than Russia's own domestic elections, with some as low as 13.05% (Slovakia) and 18.20% (Czech Republic), and only 35.60% in the UK and 42.43% in France. Europe\u2019s vote for members of the European Parliament in 2014 drew the lowest turnout ever, reflecting what most analysts say is a lack of voter enthusiasm for the institution.\n\nBut an analysis of voter turnout in individual EU countries for their own national elections finds that most have a turnout higher than Russia's.\n\nAccording to data from the EU, in the last 5 years, all countries, except Romania (41.8% in 2012), had higher voter turnouts than Russia did in their recent national elections.\n\nThe average turnout for the total number of EU countries voting in national elections was 68% in 2014. The Czech Republic had 59.5% turnout in 2013; Germany had 71.5% in 2013; Belgium had 89.4% in 2014; Bulgaria had 51.1% in 2014; Hungary was 61.8% in 2014; Slovakia was 59.1% in 2012; the UK had 85.8% in 2014.\n\nAccording to the Organization for European Interstate Cooperation, in regional elections, nearly all EU countries do significantly better than Russia regarding public participation.\n\nTurnout in Russia's September elections was the lowest since 1993; in 2007, there was 61.91% turnout and in 2011, 57.96% turnout, according to official data.", "lang": "en"}
