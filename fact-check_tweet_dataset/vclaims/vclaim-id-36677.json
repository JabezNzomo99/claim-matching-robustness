Last night I messaged her just to confirm the fact if she was there at JNU campus or not but I asked her indirectly starting from that \u2018I saw you today at Munirka\u2019 and \u2018if she was wearing red white checkered shirt\u2019 and her admission to all my questions (which were my urges to confirm her presence there at the campus) with the following audio in which she says \u2018Didi, please kisiko matt batana\u2019 is the legal evidence that she is the same person as in the pictures that were leaked yesterday confirming the fact that she was the girl with the iron stick in the \u201cunidentified mobs\u201d. I screen recorded her audio and chat as her Instagram account is no longer found.
