These are hundreds of Indians running to block #China's illegal constructions in the border with #India. Latest Beijing move might just explode in #XiJinping's face.'\n\n'Flash flood? No, it was the angry Indian people who rushed to the border between #India and #CCP! Prevent the CCP from unauthorized construction. Brave Indians! ! #MilkTeaAlliance #CCP_is_terrorist'\n\nA Korean website named insight.co.kr also published an article stating that according to the tweets, these are Indian troops heading to the Galwan Valley, a conflict area between China and India. It is an explanation that the Indian troops are trying to stop Chinese military from trying to build a structure across the line of control without the permission of the Indian government.\n\nThis video is shared virally on other platforms too.\n\nIt was also shared on YouTube channel named 'Xiaofeng Media Goes Global' with title, 'No kidding, after watching it for a long time, thought it was a flash flood? In the end, I realized that this was the angry Indian people rushing to the border between India and China! Prevent the CCP from unauthorized.'\n\nThe above claim that these are Indians going to fight Chinese is FALSE.\n\nWe could not find any reports on the mainstream media reporting any such incident occurring recently.\n\nAccording to AFP Fact Check, which also debunked this video, it belongs to the Jade mining in Myanmar. So, when we performed reverse image search using the keyframes of the video along with the keywords 'Jade mining in Myanmar', we found several results linking the viral video to the jade mining in Myanmar.\n\nFootage by BBC published in September 2019, states that hundreds of thousands of \"scavengers\" flock to the jade mines of Myanmar, risking their lives in the hope of finding a gem amongst the rubble\n\nWe also found another video which shows similar visuals of people running to get jades in the mining lands.\n\nIn an article published in Global Witness about Jade, we can see a video with similar visuals.\n\nThis video has also been debunked by altnews.in\n\nHence, the viral video does NOT belong to Indian people rushing to fight Chinese but is from Myanmar during the jade mining. The above claim is FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
