Scott Walker went after his Democratic opponent on immigration.\n\nThe spot \u2014 released Oct. 23 \u2014 dings Tony Evers on taxes before saying the longtime state schools superintendent \"wants to give in-state tuition to illegal aliens \u2026 and driver\u2019s licenses, too.\"\n\nThe ad includes clips of Evers taken from the Oct. 19, 2018, debate sponsored by the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association. They show Evers saying he would support legislation \"that would allow DACA students \u2026 to have in-state tuition,\" and that he supports driver\u2019s licenses \"for undocumented folks.\"\n\nDo those clips justify the ad\u2019s summary that Evers supports tuition and licenses for \"illegal aliens?\"\n\nThe truth of this claim hinges on the definition of a few different immigration terms, notably \"illegal alien.\" That\u2019s the preferred verbiage by many on the right for undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhatever the term, it refers to people who entered or reside in the country in violation of the law -- such as without visas or passports.\n\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact Texas found the term \"illegal alien\" crops up a few times in federal law, mostly in section headings, but it is never officially defined.\n\nSimilar terms are used -- and defined -- by the federal government, however.\n\nFor instance, the IRS defines \"undocumented alien\" as one \"who entered the United States illegally without the proper authorization and documents, or who entered the United States legally and has since violated the terms of his or her visa or overstayed the time limit.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the tuition question focuses specifically on DACA, or Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals, a program that has been in the news since President Donald Trump\u2019s administration took steps to end it a year ago. Federal courts have so far halted that effort.\n\nThose protected under DACA are often referred to as \"Dreamers.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security program launched DACA in 2012 under President Barack Obama to allow certain people who came to the country illegally as children to request a two-year deferral of immigration action. It also allows them to legally work.\n\nDACA status, which is granted at the discretion of prosecutors, is open to people who:\n\u2022 Were under age 31 as of June 2012\n\u2022 Came to the U.S. prior to their 16th birthday\n\u2022 Have lived in the U.S. continually since at least June 2007\n\u2022 Were in the U.S. in June 2012 and had no lawful status then\n\u2022 Are currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a GED or have been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces\n\u2022 Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors\n\nWith that background, let\u2019s look at the two parts of the claim in more detail.\n\nIn the debate, Evers was asked whether DACA students should get in-state tuition.\n\nEvers\u2019 response: \"I would propose or support legislation that would allow DACA students to be a part of, to have in-state tuition.\"\n\nFormer Gov. Jim Doyle signed a measure in 2009 allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public universities if they graduated from high school here, but Walker repealed that in 2011.\n\nAs noted, those with DACA status have met certain criteria to be recognized by the government and, as such, would not face immediate deportation. But DACA students by definition are those who are in this country without proper documentation, even if they were brought here by their parents as young children.\n\nDACA allows the person to defer immigration action but \"does not provide lawful status,\" according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not a position unique to the present administration. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under Obama, defined DACA immigrants as part of the group that should be counted as \"unauthorized resident immigrant population.\"\n\nFrom Evers during the debate:\n\n\"Do I think that we should have permits, driver permits for undocumented folks that are working in the state of Wisconsin? The answer is yes. Undocumented folks are working hard at jobs all across the state of Wisconsin, paying taxes, paying Social Security. They should have the opportunity \u2026 to have permits.\"\n\nEvers said an added benefit is that requiring a permit means undocumented residents \"have to learn how to drive safely in Wisconsin.\"\n\nEvers uses \"undocumented\" instead of the \"illegal aliens\" term the Walker ad invokes, but the terms are substantially similar in common usage.\n\nCurrently, someone in the country illegally cannot get a driver\u2019s license in Wisconsin, though immigrants who have obtained the DACA designation can, said Davorin Odrcic, a Milwaukee immigration attorney.\n\nWalker claims in a TV ad that Evers supports granting driver\u2019s licenses and in-state tuition for \"illegal aliens.\"\n\nWalker is clearly on point on the driver\u2019s license issue.\n\nAs for in-state tuition for DACA students, Evers backs that, too. There is a wrinkle though, in that those with DACA status have met certain criteria to be recognized by the government and, as such, would not face immediate deportation.\n\nThat said, by definition they are not in the country legally. Their DACA status delays official action against them, but it doesn\u2019t change the lack of legal status.\n\nSo the statement is accurate, but it requires some clarification and detail on DACA status. That\u2019s our definition of Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
