Ilhan Omar is circulating on social media. The congresswoman didn\u2019t write that the \u201ctime for violence is now\u201d over her disagreement with President Donald Trump\u2019s actions on Iran.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar has used social media to publicly advocate against a potential war with Iran.\n\nBut posts circulating online in recent days have spread a tweet about Iran that was falsely made to appear as if it came from the Democrat\u2019s verified Twitter account. The fake tweet suggests Omar issued a call for \u201cviolence\u201d \u2014 potentially against President Donald Trump \u2014 over the Middle East dispute. She didn\u2019t.\n\nThe fabricated tweet reads: \u201cThere is no way to overstate how ASHAMED I am to be called an \u2018American.\u2019 We need every world leader to rise up and demand that someone stops Trump from starting a catastrophic war with Iran. THE TIME FOR VIOLENCE IS NOW! #NoWarWithIran.\u201d\n\nDated Jan. 3, the bogus post includes a graphic with Omar\u2019s photo and the words, \u201cNo War With Iran.\u201d\n\nWe could find no record of Omar posting that tweet, and a spokesman for Omar also confirmed to FactCheck.org that it wasn\u2019t accurate.\n\nThe screenshot instead appears to be a doctored version of an actual tweet Omar posted on Jan. 3, which includes the same \u201cNo War With Iran\u201d graphic and some of the same words.\n\n\u201cThere is no way to overstate how dangerous this is. We need every voice to rise up and demand that Congress stop Trump from starting a catastrophic war with Iran. Sign the petition \u2192 bit.ly/IranPetitionIO #NoWarWithIran,\u201d the real tweet reads.\n\nOmar\u2019s tweet came the day after the U.S. killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, prompting concerns about a possible war with Iran.\n\nThe image of the bogus tweet was posted the same day by a Twitter account masquerading as a Fox News Channel account, as a researcher for Media Matters for America found. The fake Twitter account, archived online, was created this month and had only posted a few tweets before it was suspended.\n\nEven so, the falsified screenshot has migrated to Facebook \u2014 where it has been repeatedly posted by users.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
