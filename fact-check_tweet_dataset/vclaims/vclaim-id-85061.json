He was referring to a screenshot in which he is seen as calling Arnab a \u201cpaedophile\u201d.\n\nAgnihotri has made several seemingly desperate appeals to Mumbai police since last night.\n\nSo what is the truth? Did Agnihotri call Arnab a paedophile? That is a very serious allegation. Agnihotri claims the screenshot is a photoshop whereas his critics claim that he deleted the tweet.\n\nUnfortunately for Agnihotri, his tweet had been archived at web.archive.org and can be viewed here.\n\nScreenshots of old tweets of Agnihotri have been doing the rounds on Twitter since last night. In a series of tweets dug out by Twitter user Md Asif Khan, Agnihotri is seen to be highly critical of Arnab. Apart from the paedophile slur, he also calls Arnab\u2018s show the \u201cdustbin of media\u201d.\n\nIt is now clear that all the tweets that Agnihotri claimed were photoshopped/forged while falsely complaining to Mumbai police were in fact tweeted by him. He deleted some of the tweets, while others are still available on his Twitter timeline. Alt News brings you a collection of tweets by Agnihotri targeting Arnab along with the archived links for the individual tweets, in case he claims once again that they are photoshopped.\n\nIt is possible for reasons unknown to us that Agnihotri\u2019s views about Arnab have undergone a sea change in recent times and he feels the need to delete his old tweets. But Agnihotri must answer why he tweeted a frivolous and false complaint about several Twitter users to Mumbai police when he had deleted the tweets himself or the tweets still existed on his timeline. We hope he will find time to do so once he is done with trolling or blocking all those who are having a hearty laugh at this hypocrisy and botched attempt to cover-up. Apart from wasting time of the Mumbai Police, this falsehood has raised questions about Agnihotri\u2019s credibility. As they say, Internet never forgets. Agnihotri has learned it the hard way today.", "lang": "en"}
