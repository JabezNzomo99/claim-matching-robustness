It is more than double the $407 million that 17 groups in the network, overseen by the Koch brothers, raised during the 2012 campaign, The Washington Post\u2019s Matea Gold reported: \u201cThe figure comes close to the $1 billion that each of the two major parties\u2019 presidential nominees are expected to spend in 2016, and it cements the network\u2019s standing as one of the country\u2019s most potent political forces.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with American Public Media\u2019s Marketplace released Oct. 21, 2015, Charles Koch gave a lower estimate for the network\u2019s fundraising projection: $750 million overall, with $250 million aimed at political activities. He said: \u201cAs I said, very small portion of that $250 [million] comes from the so-called Koch brothers, and even less from me than from my brother, because everybody can choose what they want to give to. So it isn\u2019t the Koch brothers doing it. It\u2019s other people doing it.\u201d\n\nCharles Koch answered: \u201cOkay, but here\u2019s the thing. If this wasn\u2019t what people wanted, other people wanted to give to, the money wouldn\u2019t come because we\u2019re not putting it up. That\u2019s, I mean you can say, yeah, we\u2019ve improved the capability, because we say, \u2018Okay, if you want to donate to these, we need to help make it more effective and to try to pick better candidates who will do a somewhat, maybe not go 70 miles an hour, and then hope there\u2019s a few who will agree and actually try to change the trajectory of the country.'\u201d\n\nRobert Maguire, political nonprofits investigator at the Center for Responsive Politics, said there is no evidence that the Koch brothers are providing all the funding for the donor network. In fact, the Kochs have cultivated a network of \u201csympathetic, wealthy donors that fuel the political activities of the nonprofits they control,\u201d he said. Given that groups in the donor network are nonprofit organizations for the most part, there is no way for the public to know how much of the groups\u2019 revenues come from the Kochs. \u201cBut for now, it is safe to say they do not provide all of the network\u2019s funds,\u201d Maguire said.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, it is true that Charles and David Koch head up the largest, most complex, and most opaque political network in the country,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cTheir influence as political financiers and political organizers cannot be discounted. In that sense, Sanders is right that the brothers \u2014 and the members of their donor network \u2014 have an outsized influence on the who gets nominated for our country\u2019s highest offices. Most GOP presidential hopefuls, for example, have auditioned for Koch seal of approval at their donor retreats.\u201d\n\nThis figure is a fundraising goal by the end of 2016. It does exceed what the parties spent on 2016 elections in 2012, which experts tell us is a fair estimation of what the parties may spend in the 2016 election cycle. But the money will be raised by a network of approximately 300 donors, not just \u201cKoch brothers alone, one family.\u201d And the Kochs say not all $900 million will be spent on direct electoral spending; two-thirds will be spent on non-political activities, such as voter education and research.\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t know exactly how much the network will raise over the next 13 months, we do not know if the plans to spend about one third of the money raised on politics will change, and we will not know all the details of the Koch brothers\u2019 financial influence. But Sanders\u2019s particular talking point is not supported by the data currently available to the public.", "lang": "en"}
