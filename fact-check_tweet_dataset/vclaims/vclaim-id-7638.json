Hypocrisy on the Left is sickening! Your (sic) pathetic!\" user JamieR tweeted. Barr has since deleted her retweet.\n\nThe image is doctored. In the original photograph, taken at the Women\u2019s March in New York on Jan. 21, 2017, Goldberg wore a shirt that read, \"And you thought I was a nasty woman before? Buckle up, buttercup.\"\n\nGoldberg showed the original shirt she wore using video footage on The View on April 18, 2017, when the image first surfaced.\n\n\"I need to clear up a lie that was posted online this morning,\" Goldberg said. \"A photo of me at the Women\u2019s March has been photoshopped to show me wearing an offensive shirt against you-know-who. Even though I don\u2019t care for this man, I would never wear this shirt that\u2019s there.\"\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop social media users from circulating the image again in May 2017, when comedian Kathy Griffin landed in hot water after posing for photographs with a mock severed head of Trump.\n\nGoldberg explained the photo again when it resurfaced on May 30, 2018.\n\n\"Now, some bonehead photoshopped a horrific image on the shirt,\" Goldberg said. \"And (Barr) retweeted this. So this is what I\u2019m going to say, Roseanne. Just because you were caught with your pants down, don\u2019t try to drag other people down with you.\"\n\nThe picture was doctored. We rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
