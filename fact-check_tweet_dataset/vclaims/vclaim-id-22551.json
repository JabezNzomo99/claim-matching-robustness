Omsk is one (expletive) ugly grey-panel sprawl,\u201d a local man wrote on an Internet forum, according to Meduza.io.\n\nThat was because for Putin\u2019s visit, Rossiya-1 showed footage of Moscow while saying it was Omsk. The footage was specifically of the Russian capital\u2019s Mitino district, located 17 kilometers northwest of the city\u2019s center. The improvement plan for Mitino adopted by Moscow administration in 2016 cost 702 million rubles (around $12 million) in 2017 and 813 million rubles (around $13 million) in 2018.\n\n\u200bBy comparison, Omsk was rated number four on a list of Russia\u2019s ten \u201cmost depressing cities\u201d compiled in 2015 by the Russian government\u2019s Financial University. The city was renovated in recent years but the improvements have never reached beyond the downtown.", "lang": "en"}
