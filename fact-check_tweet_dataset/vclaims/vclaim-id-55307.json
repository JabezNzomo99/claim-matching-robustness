The novel coronavirus cannot spread through Mosquito bites.\n\nAccording to WHO, there is no information or evidence that suggests that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.\n\nThe new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.\n\nTherefore, to protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.\n\nAlso, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person: between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\nThese droplets can land in the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.\n\nCan Someone Spread The Virus Without Being Sick?\n\nPeople are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).\n\nSome spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n\nErgo, mosquitoes do not spread the novel coronavirus.\n\nHowever, getting bitten by mosquitoes is not good, so avoid that in general.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: In The Wake Of Coronavirus Outbreak, Discarded Face Masks Pile Up On Hong Kong's Beaches", "lang": "en"}
