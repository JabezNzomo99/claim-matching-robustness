We\u2019ve also seen similar claims on Facebook, some of which give the date as 1930. Many of the image captions say that they are turning their backs on the speaker. Altogether the image has been shared thousands of times.\n\nThe photo went viral following news that Brexit Party MEPs turned their backs while the EU anthem played at the opening session of the new EU parliament, as UKIP MEPs did back in 2014.\n\nThe historic image is listed on two picture agency websites\u2014the German S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung Photo and Alamy. Both listings say the picture was taken in 1930, and shows members of NSDAP (the Nazi party) turning away during a speech. According to both image websites, it was a speech by Dr Fritz L\u00f6wenthal, a communist party (KPD) politician who held a Reichstag seat at the time. He was not the Reichstagspr\u00e4sident (the Reichstag equivalent of the speaker) however, at the time that was the social democrat Paul L\u00f6be.\n\nThe German image website says Joseph Goebbels can be seen at the bottom right, in a light suit, leaning on his arm and writing notes.", "lang": "en"}
