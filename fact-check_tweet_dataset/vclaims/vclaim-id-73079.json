The claim is false; the misleading footage is actually from 2013 when Modi spoke to the wife of a man who died at one of his political rallies.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts have shared the misleading footage, for example here on February 16, 2019, where it has been viewed nearly 200,000 times.\n\nIt has also been posted repeatedly on YouTube, for example here, and on Twitter, for example here.\n\nThe posts have a Hindi-language caption that says: \u201cHave you ever seen such a Prime Minister who himself calls a widow of a martyr. He is wiping off their tears like a father. Your eyes will get moist after watching this.\u201d\n\nThe clip and the misleading claim were uploaded on social media two days after a suicide attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which killed around 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers. Here is an AFP report on the attack.\n\nIndian media routinely use the word \u201cmartyr\u201d to describe soldiers killed in action. For example, this Times of India news report describes the Indian soldiers killed in the February 14, 2019, suicide bomb attack in Indian-administered Kashmir as \"martyrs\".\n\nIn the misleading clip\u2019s audio, a man can be heard consoling the woman seen speaking on the telephone, enquiring about her children, and assuring her that his party will help her.\n\nThe man says: \u201cMy party workers will come to meet you, your family will be taken care and this sacrifice will not go in vain. I wanted to visit your place but it was hampered by bad weather conditions.\u201d\n\nThe woman says: \u201cMe and my daughter need your blessings.\u201d\n\nThe man replies: \u201cYou are like family and we will take care of the family.\u201d\n\nA reverse image search found the footage was first posted online in 2013.\n\nThe exact same video that appears in the misleading posts was uploaded on Narendra Modi\u2019s official YouTube channel here on November 2, 2013.\n\nThe video actually shows Modi, who was then chief minister of India\u2019s Gujarat state, speaking to a woman whose husband was killed at one of Modi\u2019s rallies.\n\nFive men died in a blast on October 27, 2013 near a Modi rally in the eastern Indian city of Patna. Here is an Indian Express report on the incident. And here is an AFP report on the incident.\n\nModi also tweeted on November 2, 2013 about the telephone call with the widow.\n\n\u201cSpoke to wife of Shaheed Munna Srivastava on phone. We are all a part of one family & stand by them in this hour of grief,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIndian media reports at the time, for example here, here and here, did not use the term \"martyrs\" to describe the five civilian victims of the 2013 bomb blast.", "lang": "en"}
