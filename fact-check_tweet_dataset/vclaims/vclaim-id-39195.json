Another image shows what looks like a medic leaning over the person. A 15-second video clip shows the same scene.\n\nThe post goes on to say that an Asian man wearing a surgical mask passed out in the middle of a crowded street in Flushing Queens before he was \"rushed to the hospital\" and \"believed to have died.\"\n\n\"According to reports, the man was walking down the street, when he was suddenly overcome with a bout of coughing. He collapsed onto the floor, and after a few seconds, he stopped moving,\" it says. \"Officers quickly arrived on the scene, but seemed unwilling to physically assist the man, perhaps out of fear.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

When officers arrived, they found a 25-year-old man who had lost consciousness and hit his head on the sidewalk. Medics brought him NewYork-Presbyterian hospital in stable condition.\n\nIt was unrelated to the coronavirus, according to police.", "lang": "en"}
