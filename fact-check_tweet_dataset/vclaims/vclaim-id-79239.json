A Twitter user posted one of the viral videos and wrote, \u201cExplosions in 2 American restaurants, KFC and Hardee\u2019s in Abu Dhabi and Dubai ahead of first Israeli commercial flight operations in the Muslim kingdom. 2 messages in 1 operation?\u201d\n\nAlt News has not uploaded the other viral videos due to their graphic nature. We have received several requests to fact-check the videos on our WhatsApp helpline (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.

As per Arabian Business, the incident happened on August 31. The report added Abu Dhabi government\u2019s response on Twitter.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Media Office posted a tweet thread writing, \u201cAccording to on-site investigations, the incident was caused by a misalignment in the gas container fittings following refuelling.\u201d This was followed by another tweet that said, \u201cUnfortunately, two victims lost their lives \u2013 one near the site of the incident, and a second passer-by who was hit by debris. We extend our heartfelt condolences to their families, God rest their souls.\u201d\n\nA report in The National, which includes one of the viral videos, confirmed the same. ABS CBN News reported, as per the Department of Foreign Affairs UAE, two Philippine nationals were killed in an explosion at a restaurant in Sheikh Rashid Bin Seed Road, (also known as Airport Road) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nThus, the social media claim that the explosions occurred after Israeli commercial flight operations began in the UAE is false.", "lang": "en"}
