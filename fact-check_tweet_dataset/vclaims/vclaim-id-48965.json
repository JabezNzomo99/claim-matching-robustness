It misleadingly carries a photo of President Rodrigo Duterte superimposed with text that reads: \u201cLahat ba kayo ay nakatanggap ng 5k-8k (Did all of you receive 5k to 8k)?\u201d and \u201cMayaman ka man o mahirap kasali ka sa listahan (Whether you are rich or poor, you\u2019re included in the list).\u201d Those were not his words and the photo was taken at a ceremony in Balangiga, Eastern Samar in September 2017.\n\nThe \u201clist\u201d the post refers to is the list of qualified SAP beneficiaries vetted by village heads. Included are recipients of the national government's cash transfer program, Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino, and families with informal economy workers, among others.\n\nThe false post, which has been shared over 2,400 times, resurfaced as the first tranche of aid distribution ended May 10. A total of 1,265 local government units met the deadline, with a payout rate of 90.86 percent. The second tranche of distribution will begin on or before May 20 for local government units that have submitted complete liquidation reports of the first phase.", "lang": "en"}
