The claim is false; the footage in the misleading posts is a clip from a 2017 television programme.\n\nThe video was shared in this Facebook post on April 22, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 280,000 times.\n\nThe misleading post's Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \"Children are being given poison in the shape of polio vaccination. Today in Peshawar more than 70 children died and at least another 700 were affected.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same video appears alongside similar claims shared elsewhere on Facebook in April 2019, for example here and here.\n\nThe Urdu-language banner pictured at the beginning of the video translates to English as: \"Is there water, poison or something else in polio vaccine?\" The text above the banner states: \"Breaking Now\".\n\nThe video in the misleading posts is actually a clip from a 2017 television report about polio vaccinations in Pakistan.\n\nThe misleading video contains a banner with the words \"#PakistanNewsRoom\". This refers to a programme named Pakistan News Room, which is broadcast by BOL Network, a Pakistani news company. This is the company\u2019s official website.\n\nThe exact same footage was published here on YouTube on April 13, 2017.\n\nBelow are screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nA journalist in AFP\u2019s Islamabad bureau analysed the 2017 video and found it contained no reference to children dying in Pakistan after being vaccinated for polio.\n\nThe original report discusses whether polio vaccines in Pakistan are properly tested before they are distributed.\n\n\u201cPolio vaccine which is being given to our millions of children, there is no testing done on it and there is no information on which ingredients are added to it,\u201d one of the presenters says in the programme\u2019s introduction.\n\nHisham Inamullah, the health minister for northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of which Peshawar is the capital, said that no children had died in April after being vaccinated for polio.\n\n\u201cNo child has died nor has been affected after taking polio vaccine,\u201d Inamullah told AFP in a face-to-face interview on April 22, 2019.\n\nThis is an AFP report published on April 27, 2019, about recent attacks on anti-polio vaccinators in Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
