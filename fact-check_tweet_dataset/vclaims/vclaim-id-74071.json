Later in the campaign, a meme circulated via social media reproduced a transcript of a brief portion of that interview, calling attention to \u201cwords that made no sense\u201d:\n\nThe transcript presented in the meme was reasonably accurate in a literal sense, as can be verified in the following video clip, although reproducing an oral statement in written form, with no punctuation and no context, can create a very different impression than one might glean from listening to a recording of the spoken version:\n\nThe full context of Biden\u2019s remark, according to ABC News\u2019 transcript of the interview, was as follows:\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And does [delaying a primary election due to the COVID-19 pandemic] hold for the [Democratic national] convention as well? If \u2014 are you open to the idea that \u2014 it just may not be possible to do the convention in August? BIDEN: Well, we\u2019re going to have to do a convention, may have to do a virtual convention. I know \u2014 I think we should be thinking about that right now. The idea of holding a convention is going to be necessary, but we may not be able to put 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 people in one place and that\u2019s very possible. Again, let\u2019s see where it is. What we do between now and then is going to dictate a lot of that as well. But my point is that I think you just got to follow the science. Listen to the experts. Listen to the Faucis of the world. And if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s the case. But we cannot let this \u2026 we\u2019ve never allowed any crisis from a Civil War, straight through to a pandemic in \u201817, all the way around \u2014 in \u201916 \u2014 we have never, never let our democracy take second fiddle, we can both have a democracy and elections and at the same time protect the public health. But I think it\u2019s time we start thinking about how we\u2019re going to hold elections, whether we\u2019re going to have to spend a lot of time figuring whether we do \u2014 is it going to mostly be by mail, which is not the preferred route for everyone \u2014 how are we going to do that? How are we going to make it available to everybody?\n\nBiden was referring to the early 20th century influenza outbreak commonly known as the \u201cSpanish flu,\u201d and (like President Donald Trump consistently does) he misstated that it began in \u201c\u201917\u201d (i.e., 1917) rather than 1918. Then he interrupted his answer a few words later to correct himself, but his correction was also erroneous, placing the outbreak a year earlier (in 1916) rather than a year later (in 1918).\n\nBiden also slurred the word \u201ctake\u201d such that it sounded like \u201csakes,\u201d and he quickly said the words \u201cway they\u201d after \u201csecond fiddle,\u201d as if he were going to pursue a different line of expression before stating that, \u201cWe can both have a democracy, and elections, and at the same time protect the public health.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
