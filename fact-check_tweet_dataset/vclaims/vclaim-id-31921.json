Democrats have criticized Attorney General William P. Barr for mischaracterizing the findings on that point in Mueller\u2019s report.\n\nHere we compare what Mueller said in his remarks with how Barr has characterized the special counsel\u2019s report and Mueller\u2019s decision not to make a determination on obstruction charges.\n\nIn his remarks at the Department of Justice, Mueller spoke for the first time about his two-year investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mueller reiterated that Russia had engaged in \u201cmultiple, systematic efforts\u201d to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, but \u201cthere was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy\u201d between the Russia government and any individuals associated with the Trump campaign. He said the \u201ccentral allegation\u201d against the Russians \u201cdeserves the attention of every American.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of obstruction, the Mueller report, which was released in redacted form on April 18, \u201cfound multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations.\u201d But the report said it could not make a \u201ctraditional prosecutorial judgment,\u201d because the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel had issued an opinion that states an \u201cindictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President\u201d would be unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cBecause we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President\u2019s conduct,\u201d the Mueller report said. \u201cThe evidence we obtained about the President\u2019s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making a traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.\u201d\n\nBarr, however, sent a letter to Congress on March 24 that said the department would not bring charges against the president. \u201cDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\u201d Barr said.\n\nWe reviewed Barr\u2019s March 24 letter, his April 18 press conference on the day he released the Mueller report, and his May 1 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and we juxtapose Barr\u2019s comments on obstruction with Mueller\u2019s.\n\nDid Mueller Intend Congress to Act on His Report?\n\nAt the May 1 Senate hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, said Mueller made \u201cnumerous references in his report to Congress playing a role in deciding whether the president committed obstruction of justice.\u201d Barr disagreed.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what, if anything, Mueller was \u201csuggesting,\u201d but in his remarks today Mueller said that one reason for laying out the evidence for obstruction is that the Constitution provides \u201ca process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nWould Mueller Have Accused Trump, If He Had Enough Evidence?\n\nIn an exchange with Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, Barr said he believes if there was enough evidence to constitute obstruction of justice then Mueller would have said so.\n\nBut in his remarks, Mueller said the OLC opinion prevents a sitting president from being charged with a federal crime and, beyond that, \u201cprinciples of fairness\u201d convinced him not to make a determination on obstruction, which he said would be unfair since the president couldn\u2019t defend himself in court.\n\nWhy Didn\u2019t Mueller Reach a Conclusion on Obstruction of Justice?\n\nIn his April 18 press conference and in his May 1 testimony, Barr described meeting with Mueller on March 5 to discuss the special counsel\u2019s findings. Mueller told him at that meeting that the special counsel\u2019s office would not make a determination on obstruction of justice.\n\nAt his press conference, Barr downplayed the influence that the OLC opinion had on Mueller\u2019s decision not to comment one way or the other on whether Trump had committed a crime. \u201cHe was not saying that but for the OLC opinion, he would have found a crime,\u201d Barr said.\n\nHere is the exchange that Barr had at his press conference.\n\nReporter, April 18: Mr. Attorney General, we don\u2019t have the report in hand. So could you explain for us the special counsel\u2019s articulated reason for not reaching a decision on obstruction of justice and if it had anything to do with the department\u2019s long-standing guidance on not indicting a sitting president? And you say you disagree with some of his legal theories. What did you disagree with and why? Barr: I\u2019d leave it to his description in the report, the special counsel\u2019s own articulation of why he did not want to make a determination as to whether or not there was an obstruction offense. But I will say that when we met with him, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and I met with him, along with Ed O\u2019Callaghan, who is the principal associate deputy, on March 5th, we specifically asked him about the OLC opinion and whether or not he was taking a position that he would have found a crime but for the existence of the OLC opinion. And he made it very clear several times that that was not his position. He was not saying that but for the OLC opinion, he would have found a crime. He made it clear that he had not made the determination that there was a crime.\n\nBarr made similar remarks in the May 1 Senate hearing, saying more than once that he did not fully understand why Mueller didn\u2019t make a prosecutorial decision on obstruction.\n\nBarr, May 1: Now we first heard that the special counsel\u2019s decision not to decide the obstruction issue at meet\u2013at the March 5th meeting when he came over to the department, and we were, frankly, surprised that\u2013that they were not going to reach a decision on obstruction. And we asked them a lot about the reasoning behind this and the basis for this. Special Counsel Mueller stated three times to us in that meeting, in response to our questioning, that he emphatically was not saying that but for the OLC opinion he would have found obstruction. He said that in the future the facts of the case against the president might be such that a special counsel would recommend abandoning the OLC opinion, but this is not such a case. We did not understand exactly why the special counsel was not reaching a decision. And when we pressed him on it, he said that his team was still formulating the explanation.\n\nLater, in an exchange with Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Barr said he did not take the OLC opinion into consideration when making his decision that there wasn\u2019t sufficient evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice. Barr also told Whitehouse that he wasn\u2019t sure what Mueller meant in his report by his remarks on the OLC opinion.\n\nSimilarly, Barr told Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, that he could not fully explain why Mueller reached no conclusion on obstruction of justice.\n\nKennedy, May 1: Okay. Can you\u2013can you briefly go over with me one more time\u2013I find it curious that the Mueller team spent all this time investigating obstruction of justice and then reached no conclusion. Tell me again briefly why Mr. Mueller told you he reached no conclusion or he couldn\u2019t make up his mind or whatever I\u2019m not trying to put words in your mouth? Barr: I really couldn\u2019t recapitulate it. I\u2013it was unclear to us. We first discussed it on March 5, the deputy was with me, Ed O\u2019Callaghan the principal associate deputy and we didn\u2019t really get a clear understanding of the reasoning and the report I\u2019m not sure exactly what the full line of reasoning is and that\u2019s one of the reasons I didn\u2019t want to try to put words in Bob Mueller\u2019s mouth. Kennedy: But he\u2013he did not choose to bring an indictment. We know that much. Kennedy: Regardless of the reason.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Mueller told Barr at the March 5 meeting, but Mueller made it clear in his first-ever public remarks why he had not made a determination of whether Trump committed a crime.\n\nMueller said he did not make a determination that there wasn\u2019t a crime for two reasons: Department policy doesn\u2019t allow a sitting president to be charged with a federal crime, and, because of that policy, \u201cit would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose were the principles under which we operated and from them we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime,\u201d Mueller said today.\n\nMueller, May 29: [A]s set forth in the report after that investigation, if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime. The introduction to the volume two of our report explains that decision. It explains that under long-standing department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that too is prohibited. The special counsel\u2019s office is part of the department of justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider. \u2026 And beyond department policy we were guided by principles of fairness. It would be unfair to potentially \u2014 it would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge. So that was justice department policy. Those were the principles under which we operated and from them we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, read a section from the Mueller report in which the special counsel explains why he would not state that Trump did not commit obstruction of justice. Barr called it a \u201cvery strange statement.\u201d\n\nBarr may have found it strange, but Mueller repeated it in his remarks today.\n\nMueller also explained why his office investigated efforts to obstruct justice.\n\n\u201cThe matters we investigated were of paramount importance. It was critical for us to obtain full and accurate information from every person we questioned,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of their government\u2019s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.\u201d\n\nMueller did not take any questions.", "lang": "en"}
