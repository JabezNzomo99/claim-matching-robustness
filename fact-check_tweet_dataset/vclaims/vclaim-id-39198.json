There is currently no evidence that this virus can survive that long on packages. The advice from medical bodies including the NHS, the USA\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organisation (WHO) all say that the risk of catching the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 from a package is low, or that there\u2019s no evidence this can happen.\n\nWhat does the medical advice say?\n\nThe NHS says simply \u201cThere is currently no evidence that you can catch coronavirus from parcels and letters\u201d, and that it\u2019s \u201cvery unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food.\u201d\n\nThe CDC explains this a bit more, saying \u201cIn general, because of poor survivability of [other coronaviruses SARS and MERS] on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures.\u201d\n\nAnd the WHO explains that: \u201cThe likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.\u201d\n\nAs Dr Todd Ellerin, an expert in infectious diseases, wrote on the Harvard Medical School blog: \u201cRemember, this is a respiratory virus similar to the flu. We don\u2019t stop receiving packages from China during their flu season. We should follow that same logic for this novel pathogen.\u201d\n\nWhat do we know about how long this coronavirus survives on surfaces?\n\nBecause the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 (technically known as SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, there is little direct evidence on how it behaves.\n\nHowever, because coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that have been studied for decades, it\u2019s possible to look at the characteristics of similar viruses as a reasonable guide to this one.\n\nA scientific paper surveying the available evidence on how long coronaviruses can survive on inanimate surfaces, published after the Covid-19 outbreak began, concluded that \u201cHuman coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the suggestion that the novel coronavirus can survive on surfaces for 28 days may stem from an article by AccuWeather, which referenced a 2010 study and said that at \u201clower temperatures, the virus could survive on a stainless steel surface from 5 to 28 days\u201d. But it\u2019s worth noting that this was a study of animal coronaviruses, not human ones, and that the viruses lasted longest in very cold and dry conditions: at 4\u00b0C and 20% humidity. This study was considered in the above paper that concluded human coronaviruses can survive for up to 9 days.\n\nIn practice, as the WHO says, a package that \u201chas been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature\u201d is unlikely to see the virus last as long. And as the CDC puts it, while it may be possible to pick up the virus from contaminated surfaces in general, \u201cthis is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads\u201d. The main way the virus spreads is believed to be from person-to-person contact.\n\nThe best way to stop the spread of the virus remains to regularly wash your hands with soap and water for twenty seconds, or if that\u2019s not available, using a hand sanitiser that has at least 60% alcohol.", "lang": "en"}
