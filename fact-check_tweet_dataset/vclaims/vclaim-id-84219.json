The claim is false; the photo shows London\u2019s Hyde Park.\n\nThe photo is contained in this Facebook post, which has been shared more than 10,000 times since it was uploaded on April 28, 2019.\n\nIts caption reads: \u201cThis is what the hypocritical Greeny environmentalist leave behind after their convoy to Clermont. Send Bob the cleanup bill.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nA man called Bob Brown was interviewed in Clermont, a coal-mining town in the northeastern Australian state of Queensland, on April 28 by national broadcaster ABC.\n\nIn the ABC report here, Brown is described as the leader of a group of protesters who oppose a major coal mine project backed by mining giant Adani.\n\nHere is an AFP report about the mine proposal published on April 9, 2019.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo actually shows Hyde Park in the UK's capital London.\n\nReverse image searches on Google led to this April 23, 2019, tweet from the verified account of Royal Parks, a charity that manages eight parks in London.\n\nThe tweet is embedded below:\n\nThe caption of the tweet states in part: \u201cThis photo is the result of an unofficial event in Hyde Park on Saturday, not the #ExtinctionRebellion protesters [sic] in Marble Arch.\u201d\n\nThe same photo has also been circulating since April in multiple online posts that say it shows Hyde Park, such as here on Facebook, here and here on Twitter and here on Instagram. It is also included in several Reddit posts, for example here and here.\n\nThe Saturday prior to April 23 was April 20, when a climate protest organised by environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion took place near Marble Arch, which is located next to Hyde Park, as seen on Google Maps here.\n\nThis BBC report from the same day says 750 people were arrested in the event. AFP also covered the protests here.\n\nCannabis smokers also gather at Hyde Park annually on April 20. Online magazine VICE published photos from this year\u2019s event in this report dated April 23, 2019.\n\nFormer Australian diplomat Mark Higgie tweeted similar images showing rubbish scattered around Hyde Park on April 20, in this tweet embedded below:\n\nDue to a lack of signs and other landmarks, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly where in Hyde Park the photo in the misleading post was taken. But the distinctive paths and open space with clusters of trees behind can be seen in Google Maps imagery from the park.\n\nThe image below compares the misleading photo (far left) with screenshots from Google Maps showing Hyde Park from other angles:", "lang": "en"}
