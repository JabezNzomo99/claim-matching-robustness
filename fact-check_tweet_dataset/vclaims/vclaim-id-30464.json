Montoya since December 2011.\n\nAccording to its website, the OIG, which has a separate budget from HUD, works independently from the department in an effort to \u201cpromote efficiency and effectiveness in programs and operations; detect and deter fraud and abuse; investigate allegations of misconduct by HUD employees; and review and make recommendations regarding existing and proposed legislation and regulations affecting HUD.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump nominated Carson, a former neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate, to serve as HUD secretary in December, but the Senate did not confirm Carson to the post until March 2 \u2014 one day after the OIG published an updated report providing the total value of the errors.\n\n\u201cHUD reissued its fiscal years 2016 and 2015 (restated) consolidated financial statements due to pervasive material errors that we identified,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThe total amounts of errors corrected in HUD\u2019s notes and consolidated financial statements were $516.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.\u201d\n\nBut, as the report noted, the OIG first notified HUD officials last year of issues it found during a routine review required by federal law. That was long before Carson became secretary.\n\nHUD OIG, March 1: On November 15, 2016, we issued an independent auditor\u2019s report stating that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was unable to provide final fiscal years 2016 and 2015 consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in a timeframe that would allow us to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to determine whether they were free from material misstatement. We also reported on the delays encountered in the material weakness, Weak Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Led to Errors and Delays in the Preparation of Financial Statements and Notes. \u2026 Despite having to disclaim on HUD\u2019s fiscal years 2016 and 2015 financial statements and notes, we continued our review of the financial statements. Our review identified material errors and misstatements in the financial statements and notes. The results of that review are contained in this report (see Material Weaknesses section) and update the material weakness, Weak Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Led to Errors and Delays in the Preparation of Financial Statements and Notes, reported in Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit reports 2017-FO-0003 and 2017-FO-0004. We notified HUD management in early December 2016 and requested that it perform its own review. HUD concluded its review and agreed with us that the pervasiveness and scope of the errors contained in the financial statements justified the need to reissue the statements to correct the errors. HUD withdrew its AFR [agency financial report], and on December 28, 2016, HUD\u2019s Acting Chief Financial Officer notified the Inspector General that HUD had requested from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) an extension for submitting its AFR from November 15, 2016, to March 1, 2017.\n\nFor example, the OIG said at least $119 billion in errors were due to incorrect rounding.\n\n\u201cWe found several instances in which rounding was performed to the nearest billion and hundred billion, while OMB Circular A-136 requires the highest level of rounding to be at the nearest million,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn conclusion, the report said \u201cHUD was able to make revisions to correct the errors identified and make other corrections that were later identified by OCFO,\u201d or the Office of the Chief Financial Officer. \u201cOCFO reissued its financial statements, which included corrections totaling $516.4 billion to its notes and $3.4 billion to its financial statements.\u201d\n\nThe report refers to the total as an \u201cabsolute value.\u201d That\u2019s because some of the errors were positive figures and others were negative. In all, there were nearly $520 billion in changes.\n\nHowever, in a Feb. 24 memo from Deputy Chief Financial Officer Courtney Timberlake, HUD said, \u201cOverall, the combined adjustments to the consolidated financial statements resulted in a net adjustment of $3 million, but no change in HUD\u2019s financial position or impact on our programs.\u201d\n\nThe OIG didn\u2019t dispute HUD\u2019s response, but called it an attempt by the department to play down \u201cthe severity of the condition and impact of the errors identified.\u201d The report said: \u201cWhile the errors identified may not have changed HUD\u2019s financial position, as HUD states at the bottom of its financial statements, \u2018The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\u2019 These notes contained errors of $516.4 billion.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: the OIG, not Carson, was responsible for the audit that led to the correction of over $500 billion in bookkeeping errors by HUD during the Obama administration. Carson wasn\u2019t in office when OIG initiated the audit and the secretary has no authority over the independent IG office.\n\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cHUD\u2019s Fiscal Years 2016 and 2015 (Restated) Consolidated Financial Statements Audit (Reissued).\u201d Audit Report Number: 2017-FO-0005. 1 Mar 2017.\n\nCurl, Joseph. \u201cBen Carson Finds $500 Billion (Billion!)
