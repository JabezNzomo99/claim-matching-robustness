The original image of the burning flag comes from a video of protest in Argentina regarding the Falklands.\n\nAnother instance of flag burning does appear to have taken place; a video showing a souvenir flag being burned, allegedly during this weekend\u2019s protests against the prorogation of Parliament, was shared by Mail Online. However, it\u2019s unclear from the video exactly when it was taken or what cause they\u2019re trying to support or oppose. The video is 14 seconds long, and there are no other protesters visible in the shot.", "lang": "en"}
