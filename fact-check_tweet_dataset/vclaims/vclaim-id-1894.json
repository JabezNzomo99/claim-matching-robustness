This video has gone viral on several WhatsApp groups and on Facebook.\n\nThe original video is of an attack on a police party at Madanwada in Chhattisgarh\u2019s Rajnandgaon district in 2009. Telugu news channel NTV had played the video as part of their news bulletin on August 17, 2016.\n\nThe Rajnandgaon attack video was released by the guerrilla fighters seven years after the incident, in 2016. Over 30 police personnel including the local superintendent of police lost their lives in the gruesome attack. The naxals were said to have released the video last year to create fear among those who opposed their activities in the region, as reported by The Asian Age.\n\nAt least 25 CRPF personnel were killed and six wounded in Sukma district on Monday, the deadliest attack by Naxals targeting security forces this year.", "lang": "en"}
