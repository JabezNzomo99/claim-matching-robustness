The national rate is 1.16 per 100,000.\n\n\"We call on Georgia\u2019s lawmakers to make it an urgent priority to keep guns away from domestic abusers and protect women from harm,\" Kathryn Grant, co-founder of GunSense Georgia said in a statement related to the study. \"This is literally a matter of life and death.\"\n\nPolitiFact Georgia wanted to know if our state really ranks that high on the list for women murdered by men.\n\nWe went straight to the website for the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s .\n\nThat data showed Georgia had 102 homicides in 2012 \u2013 19 percent more than the 84 tallied in the Violence Policy Center report.\n\nThe VPC\u2019s study has a lower overall number because it takes that data and then weeds out crimes with more than one victim or perpetrator, said VPC policy analyst Marty Langley, who authored the report.\n\nAn analysis of the SHR data, available only in hard copy from the FBI, confirms those numbers are accurate for incidents where one woman is killed by one man.\n\nJames Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor who has studied and analyzed such data for decades, said the adjustment oversimplifies the information.\n\nTaking a more narrow slice of victims also allows for further analysis of their characteristics such as age (the victim in Georgia was 38) and race (51 were black and 30 were white in Georgia).\n\nAnd for homicides where the data could be found, 69 percent of victims were killed with guns and 93 percent of them were murdered by someone they knew, the study found.\n\n\"An overarching point we want to make with this study is that it\u2019s a myth that a woman\u2019s risk of homicide comes from being attacked by a stranger,\" said Kristen Rand, the group\u2019s legislative director. \"The risk of stranger homicide is really quite low.\"\n\nBut missing from the report is another key fact: the risk of homicide in Georgia is among the highest for any victims. It\u2019s easier to see in lists:\n\nSouthern states such as Georgia dominate both lists, Fox said, because of factors beyond gender.\n\nGun ownership rates are higher here. The South also has a long history of people solving personal conflicts with violence versus lawsuits, Fox said.\n\nAnd, he added, the region is also more diverse than much of the country, and murder rates by and against blacks are higher than those among whites.\n\n\"The fact that most of the states on (the VPC) list are in the south is not so much an issue of male-female violence,\" Fox said. \"It\u2019s about homicide, generally.\"\n\nIn summary, the data bears out the study\u2019s findings that rank Georgia ninth in the nation for the rate of women killed by men.\n\nOne caveat is that tally counts only single victims and perpetrators. It ignores some crimes it hopes to draw attention to, such as a former partner killing a woman before committing suicide or a man killing his ex-partner and a new love interest, if there are two victims.\n\nMore importantly, the tally also fails to acknowledge Georgia\u2019s dismal rank for the risk of homicide overall, and the other factors that contribute to it.\n\nThe numbers are right, but it\u2019s also true that there is more to the story.", "lang": "en"}
