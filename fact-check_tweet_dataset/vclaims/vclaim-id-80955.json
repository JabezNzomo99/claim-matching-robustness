But the claim is false; the video actually shows a BJP politician in Indian-administered Kashmir going to register as an election candidate.\n\nThe misleading video and claim have been posted repeatedly on social media, for example here, where it has been shared more than 11,000 times on Facebook since it was uploaded May 2, 2019.\n\nThe one-minute 55-second video claims to show men and women in Pakistan\u2019s western Balochistan province dancing, singing folk songs and waving the BJP flag -- which bears the party\u2019s lotus flower symbol and acronym on a saffron and green background.\n\nThe Hindi-language caption translates as: \u201cThe Bharatiya Janata Party flag was waved in Pakistan\u2019s Balochistan. If the Modi government comes back, Balochistan will be independent. With Modi at the helm, it is possible.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nIndia is currently holding its election, which lasts for six weeks and ends on May 19.\n\nThe exact same footage as is used in the misleading posts was originally posted online by Sofi Yousuf, a BJP member of the Jammu and Kashmir legislative council, and a candidate in the Anantnag constituency of Indian-administered Kashmir, according to his Facebook page here and as reported here.\n\nYousuf uploaded the original video to his verified Twitter account on March 30, 2019 with the caption: \u201cWhile going to file nomination papers\u201d.\n\nA Google reverse image search found that the exact same footage was also posted on Facebook here by online portal \u2018Fast Kashmir\u2019 on March 30, 2019.\n\nThe caption on the Fast Kashmir post says: \u201cVideo, BJP Candidate Sofi Yousuf files nomination form for Parliamentary polls in South Kashmir\u2019s Anantnag.\u201d\n\nThe video in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the original video put up by Yousuf on Twitter (R) are placed side by side below for comparison. Note in both there is a man in a mask in the foreground and a BJP flag behind:\n\nLocal media covered Yousuf filing his candidate nomination papers, for example here, here and here.", "lang": "en"}
