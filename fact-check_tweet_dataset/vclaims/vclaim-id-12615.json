It was one of those photos, with Casey giving a thumbs-up outside of the White House, that was used in the meme.\n\nCasey had posted the photos with this caption: \u201cEvropa has landed at the White House!\u201d Later that day, he posted a tweet that said: \u201cTO CLARIFY: I attended the White House during a tour, for which tickets are freely available to the public.\u201d\n\nWe are unable to check White House visitor logs because the Trump administration doesn\u2019t make them public, and our request for comment from the administration wasn\u2019t answered. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency: \u201cHe was one of more than twenty-five thousand people who came to the White House Fall Garden Tour, which is open to the public. Free tickets are made available to anyone who wants to attend.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nSanders, Sarah. White House Press Secretary. \u201cAs a result of today\u2019s incident, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice.\u201d Twitter. 7 Nov 2018.\n\nCasey, Patrick. \u201cEvropa has landed at the White House!\u201d Twitter. 7 Nov 2018.\n\n\u201cTrump administration says white supremacist came to White House as part of garden tour.\u201d Jewish Telegraphic Agency. 8 Nov 2018.", "lang": "en"}
