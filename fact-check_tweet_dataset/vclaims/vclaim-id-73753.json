For example, Facebook page QatarSocialMedia posted supposed photos of the earthquake's impact, with the caption, \"6.9-magnitude recorded in #Philippines today on August 18. Also there are 4 active #volcanoes in Alert Level 1 (signaling abnormal volcanic activity) following the +6.5-magnitude of heavy earthquake.\"\n\nOn August 18, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) reshared a graphic that indicates when the 4 volcanoes were placed under Alert Level 1. The Mayon and Bulusan volcanoes have been under Alert Level 1 since July 2020, while Taal and Kanlaon have been under Alert Level 1 since March 2020.\n\n\"The earthquake occurrence is obviously later,\" Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum Jr told Rappler in a text message. \"[Whether] the earthquake will have an effect on the activity of Mayon and Bulusan, we will monitor,\" he said.\n\n\"The nearest active volcano is the Biliran Volcano which is approximately 65 kilometers from the epicenter and this earthquake is tectonic in origin,\" the primer said.\n\nIn addition, one photo used in these two posts was misrepresented. The photo of a woman comforting a child came from a video depicting the aftermath of an earthquake in Mexico in June 2020.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
