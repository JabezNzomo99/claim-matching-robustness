So showerheads \u2014 you take a shower, the water doesn\u2019t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn\u2019t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect. Dishwashers \u2014 you didn\u2019t have any water, so you \u2014 the people that do the dishes \u2014 you press it, and it goes again, and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you\u2019ll end up using less water. So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water. And in many places \u2014 in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don\u2019t know what to do with it. It\u2019s called \u201crain.\u201d They don\u2019t have a problem.\n\nThis was far from the first time the president had riffed on poorly functioning appliances. In December 2019, as Trump spoke in the Roosevelt Room of the White House amidst an impeachment inquiry, he digressed into railing about toilets and other bathroom fixtures that allegedly frustrate their users due to the use of low-flow technology. CNN reported:\n\nThe President claimed Americans are flushing their toilets \u201c10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once\u201d and argued that they are having difficulty with washing their hands in what appeared to be a tangent about low-flow sinks and toilets. \u201cWe have a situation where we\u2019re looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on \u2014 and in areas where there\u2019s tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don\u2019t get any water,\u201d the President said during a roundtable with small business leaders about deregulatory actions. \u201cYou turn on the faucet and you don\u2019t get any water. They take a shower and water comes dripping out. Just dripping out, very quietly dripping out,\u201d the President continued, lowering his voice as he spoke about the drips. \u201cPeople are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once.\u201d It wasn\u2019t entirely clear what he was talking about, but it appeared to have to do with bathroom fixtures with low-flow appliances. He said the Environmental Protection Agency was looking into the issue on his suggestion. \u201cThey end up using more water. So (the) EPA is looking at that very strongly at my suggestion,\u201d Trump said, though he did not give details on what suggestions, if any, he made.\n\nNPR quoted the Pacific Institute, a non-profit research institute with a focus on global and regional freshwater issues, as asserting that Trump\u2019s statements did not comport with reality:\n\nPeter Gleick with the Pacific Institute in Oakland considers this all to be Trumpian nostalgia for a time when showers were strong, toilets used 4 gallons a flush and lightbulbs burned your hands when you touched them. Gleick said these newer household items are part of an \u201cefficiency revolution,\u201d doing the same tasks with less and halting the upward trajectory of water and energy consumption in America. And, yes, a dishwasher cycle takes longer, and incandescent bulbs are cheaper to buy upfront. But in the long run, \u201cThey\u2019re much more expensive, because they use a huge amount of energy, which we pay for over time and they burn out 20 times faster,\u201d Gleick said. Based on the way Trump talks about efficient lightbulbs, it seems his complaint is with compact fluorescent bulbs, which were the only low-energy bulbs widely available 10 years ago. But today, store shelves are full of LED bulbs with warmer-looking light and even longer life spans. Gleick suspects Trump\u2019s toilet complaints are outdated as well, because low-flow toilet technology has come a long way in recent years. \u201cSome people got bad toilets, but that was 15 and 20 years ago,\u201d Gleick said. \u201cAnd now the new toilets not only use a tiny fraction of the water the old toilets used to use, but the truth is they flush better \u2014 and if you have a bad toilet that doesn\u2019t flush, well, that\u2019s because you have a bad toilet.\u201d\n\nA video of the portion of the speech reproduced in the above meme can be viewed here:", "lang": "en"}
