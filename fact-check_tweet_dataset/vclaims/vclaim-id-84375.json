He was making a reference to the pomp with which Modi is received abroad, as compared to the low-profile and 'gaffe-prone nature' of Singh\u2019s visits abroad. Further, he mentioned that a certain leader of Congress party keeps bringing up the issue of Modi\u2019s foreign travels, but does not mention who.\n\nSince Shah does not explicitly mention which 5-year term of Manmohan Singh he is comparing to Modi's first term, BOOM examined the number of trips taken and the number of countries visited across both Manmohan Singh terms.\n\nData from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) shows a list of 56 international trips that Modi has undertaken since assuming office in 2014. It includes his latest trip to the United States which he undertook in September this year.\n\nAccording to this data, Modi took a total of 49 trips during his first term as Prime Minister. The records show his first trip to Bhutan in June 2014, and his last trip was to the Republic of Korea in February this year.\n\nOn the contrary, Manmohan Singh has taken:\n\u2022 35 trips during his first tenure as Prime Minister, where his first trip was to Bangkok in July 2004 and his last trip to London for the G20 Summit in April - May 2009\n\u2022 38 trips during his second tenure as Prime Minister, where his first trip was to Russia for the BRICS and SCO Summit in June 2009 and his last trip was to Myanmar in March 2014.\n\nTherefore, whichever five year period is compared, Manmohan Singh's trips stand fewer than Modi's.\n\nManmohan Singh visited 93 countries across his two terms, counting repeated visits. These figures are available not only with the former PM's archives, but also has been reported in articles here.\n\nModi has, in his first term alone, visited 93 countries. Therefore, Modi exceeds Singh official travels, by even the number of countries visited.\n\nAll the data accessed can be found:", "lang": "en"}
