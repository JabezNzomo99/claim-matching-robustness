Pasrija was not immediately reachable for a comment. (Click here to read the judgement)\n\nWhile Trupti Desai has been the face of the fight of the growing campaign for gender equality in religious places and has dealt with violence and abuse from religious leaders and women, she has never approached the courts or petitioned for the cause.\n\nTrupti Desai is the founder of Bhumata Brigade, a Pune based social justice organisation, and has been one of the few women at the forefront of the fight to let women enter places of worship. She shot to fame in 2016 for leading a group of women into Shani Shingnapur - a religious shrine in Maharashtra dedicated to the Hindu god Shani, which bans the entry of women. This was followed by her entering the sanctum sanctorum of Trimbakeshwar temple in Nashik and then visiting Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai.\n\nBOOM also reached out to Desai to clarify the identity of the people in the video. Desai said that organisations across three religions - Hinduism, Islam and Christianity - had come to visit her after the Sabarimala verdict.\n\n\u201cMany local news channels and organisations came and congratulated me after the Sabarimala verdict. While I have not been a petitioner, many groups have supported me for being vocal about these issues and helping change mindsets by taking action like entering temples,\u201dDesai told BOOM.\n\nShe added that the Christian organisation from Goa and Maharashtra had also come to visit her. \u201cIn the group in the video are Sangita Pappani - a Christian who works for the upliftment of minority Christians in Pune, Manisha Tilekar a Hindu and a member Bhumata Brigade and Chandrakanta Kudalkar who works with women from across all religions. The group also included members of the Republican Sena a group that works for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. On the same day, members of a Muslim group Zamzam-e -Khidmat that works for all religions also visited me and congratulated me,\u201dshe said.\n\nBOOM was also able to access other photos and another video of the same day showing members of different faiths approaching Desai one by one and felicitating her with flowers, sweets and garlands.", "lang": "en"}
