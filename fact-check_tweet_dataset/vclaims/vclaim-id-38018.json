Trump Foundation in service of his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe ruling was part of a settlement to a June 2018 case filed by the office of the New York state attorney general against Trump, his three eldest children and their charitable foundation. The lawsuit alleged that the Trump Foundation had long \u201coperated in persistent violation of state and federal law governing New York State charities\u201d by, among other things, allowing Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign committee to direct and coordinate the foundation\u2019s televised fundraiser for veterans in Des Moines, Iowa, in January 2016.\n\nIn a statement posted to Twitter on Nov. 7, Trump called the lawsuit a form of \u201cpolitically motivated harassment,\u201d and seemingly dismissed the judge\u2019s ruling as insignificant. \u201cAll they found was incredibly effective philanthropy and some small technical violations, such as not keeping board minutes,\u201d Trump\u2019s statement read.\n\nThere was more to it than that.\n\nIn her ruling on Nov. 7, state Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla wrote that the parties resolved most of the attorney general\u2019s claims on their own, but left it to her to determine what Trump would have to personally pay for his alleged misuse of his foundation.\n\n\u201cA review of the record \u2026 establishes that Mr. Trump breached his fiduciary duty to the Foundation and that waste occurred to the Foundation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s fiduciary duty breaches included allowing his campaign to orchestrate the Fundraiser, allowing his campaign, instead of the Foundation, to direct distribution of the Funds, and using the Fundraiser and distribution of the Funds to further Mr. Trump\u2019s political campaign.\u201d\n\nScarpulla said that she found that the $2.8 million raised at the Iowa fundraiser \u201cwas used for Mr. Trump\u2019s political campaign and disbursed by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign staff, rather than by the Foundation, in violation\u201d of several laws. However, she ordered Trump to pay $2 million in waste damages \u2014 not the full $2.8 million sought by the attorney general \u2014 because \u201cthe Funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTrump will pay the $2 million to eight previously agreed upon charities, which also will share the now-dissolved Trump Foundation\u2019s remaining $1.8 million in assets.\n\nAs part of the settlement agreement, Trump and his lawyers also acknowledged past instances in which Trump had caused his foundation to make payments on behalf of some of his businesses, including Mar-a-Lago and the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, New York. And Trump agreed to reimburse $11,525 to the foundation for a payment it made for auction items at a charitable benefit.", "lang": "en"}
