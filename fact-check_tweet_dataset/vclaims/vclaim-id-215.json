Different iterations of the claim have around 530,000 shares on Facebook as of April 29, 2020 ( here , here , here ).\n\nOne post reads: \u201cPlease do not pet your dog or any pet after using hand sanitizer. It contains ethanol glycol that\u2019s also found in anti-freeze that\u2019s toxic to them! They might lick the area you\u2019ve touched them. Please share to make others aware.\u201d Another reads: \u201cPet owners please be aware that hand sanitizer has the same ingredients as antifreeze. Don\u2019t let animals lick it off your hands it can kill.\u201d\n\nThe claim is circulating amidst the coronavirus outbreak and the increased demand for hand sanitizer, as governments and health authorities advise people to keep their hands clean ( here ).\n\nThe information in these posts is misleading. Reuters found no evidence that hand sanitizers contain ethylene glycol, which is commonly used in anti-freeze and is indeed highly poisonous for pets ( here ) and humans ( here ).\n\nPropylene glycol (PG), a substitute for ethylene glycol in anti-freeze (spca.bc.ca/faqs/antifreeze/), is sometimes used in hand-sanitizers (here). The Pet Poison Helpline says poisoning can occur if dogs or cats ingest \u201clarge amounts\u201d of propylene glycol but says PG is one of the least toxic glycols and has a \u201cwider margin of safety\u201d as compared to ethylene glycol\u201d ( here ). While propylene glycol is listed in Cornell\u2019s Small Animal Toxins list ( here ) , Dr Karyn Bischoff of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine told Reuters that it is \u201cnot nearly as dangerous as ethylene glycol\u201d.\n\nMost hand sanitizers contain alcohol (ethanol or ethyl alcohol). Alcohol usually does not entice pets (as ethylene glycol does) but can be toxic if ingested in large amounts ( here , here ).\n\nFor these reasons, the Pet Poison Helpline says a \u201clarge ingestion\u201d of hand sanitizer would be dangerous for a pet. ( here ).However, Dr Bischoff told Reuters via email that hand sanitizer is not a hazard for pets if owners use it properly in normal amounts.\n\n\u201cIf an animal licks the skin of someone who used hand sanitizer properly (in a reasonable amount), I would not consider it a veterinary emergency,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said hand sanitizer might cause other types of discomfort for pets with its \u201cpungent odor and fumes\u201d. This could provoke irritation of the nose or eyes and anxiety \u201cparticularly if used around cats who tend to be sensitive to such things.\u201d\n\nFalse. While ingesting a large amount of hand sanitizer could hurt a pet, animals are not in danger from being touched by a person who has cleaned their hands with it, or from licking their hand.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
