People posted the photo on social media, reporting sightings of the large fish all over North America, in Central America, Europe and Asia. More recently it has returned to Canada with claims that the beast was spotted in the streets of Gatineau, Quebec following a flood.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the biggest fish I ever caught, not even by a long shot,\u201d Steve Kaye, a fishing guide in the western Canadian province of British Columbia, told AFP. On August 9, 2016, while out fishing with clients, his line caught a large sturgeon which he estimated weighed between 185-200 pounds.\n\nKaye sent AFP the original photo of the sturgeon by email, along with two other images showing the fish from August 9, 2016.\n\nFor Kata Kaye, the administrator of Sturgeon Hunter, Steve\u2019s fishing tour company, the photo of the fish caught in the waters of the Fraser River was something to be shared on social media.\n\nKaye was right beyond what she could foresee. Within a week, people reported the sturgeon was in Maine or Idaho, sometimes claiming to have caught it themselves, or as a joke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous, the places we\u2019ve seen it pop up. Russia, overseas, pretty much any river that remotely has sturgeon in the US it\u2019s been reported in, all over Canada, you name it,\u201d Steve Kaye recounted to AFP.\n\nThe photo was also shared in other languages, with reports of a large unknown fish in Indonesia, a six-meter long sturgeon in Italy\u2019s Lago di Posta Fibreno or simply a \u201cstrange fish\u201d in El Salvador\u2019s Rio Lampa.\n\nKaye, who spends nearly every day of fishing season on the Fraser River, downstream from Chilliwack, doesn\u2019t really understand the virality of the photo: \u201cThere\u2019s something about that picture that, for some reason, people really like.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a bigger fish like that, once the fish starts to tire, we just lead them to shore, then they can be photographed and released. A lot of times once they do get to shore, they get quite docile,\u201d Kaye said. \u201cIt was just sitting there, it was slow and not really moving, recuperating,\u201d when he took the photo.\n\nKaye said he has reported some of the online publications for poaching his photo and sharing it out of context, but new posts keep appearing. Recently, a 2017 Facebook publication claiming that a two-meter-long sturgeon was found in the streets of Gatineau, Quebec, following a flood, has resurfaced in Canada\u2019s French-speaking province, possibly as a result of the Spring 2019 floods in the same area.\n\nAt least some people know that the fish came from the Fraser River.\n\nKaye joked, \u201cI\u2019ve had multiple clients come back into my boat, show me this picture and say, \u2018Can we catch a fish like that?\u2019\u201d", "lang": "en"}
