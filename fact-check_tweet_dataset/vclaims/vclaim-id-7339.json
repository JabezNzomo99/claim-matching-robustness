All of these accounted to a combined total of 505 interactions and 506,847 followers as of August 17.\n\nGascon also told Rappler that he has not travelled to China since becoming Chair; and the CHR\u2019s yearly travel budget does not allow them to spend P6.7 million in one month.\n\nBoth blogs have a different cost of the alleged trip: per trip was at P6.7 million in the headline while P7.6 million in the body of the story.\n\nFor instance, according to the blog post, COA Chief Auditor Miguel Ramirez pointed out Gascon and his \u201centourage\u201d spent P21.7 million on travels abroad and 3 trips to China in June alone.\n\nHowever, when asked via email, COA replied that there was no \u201cChief Auditor\u201d Miguel Ramirez in their office. The name was also not listed in COA\u2019s directory.\n\nThere are also no news reports and press releases supporting the claim in COA\u2019s website. For 2018, there were only two press releases made by the agency as of posting time.\n\nOne example, the most expensive, was a business writing and oral communication skills training at Dream Ventures Property Management Corporation in Quezon City. The agency spent P585,850 for the said 4-day training.\n\nThe 2018 audit reports for government agencies are not yet released since the fiscal year is not over yet. Reports are typically released mid-year, before the new National Expenditure Program is submitted to Congress.", "lang": "en"}
