This is misleading, as data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) shows. The message makes several other false claims, which we debunk here.\n\nA WhatsApp voice note by a man who identifies himself as a former UN volunteer and graduate from Nigeria\u2019s Ibadan University has been shared across numerous groups in Nigeria. An AFP reporter received the voice note more than 20 times on WhatsApp. It was posted multiple times in a single group by different people.\n\nIt has also been shared by hundreds of people on Twitter, including here.\n\nThe speaker in the voice note claims that as a former UN volunteer, he has access to privileged WHO information.\n\nHe alleges that the global mortality rate linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, was 0.2 percent a month ago.\n\nRegarding Nigeria, \u201cour estimate is 45 million people are going to die if the virus spreads the way it should, the way it is spreading in Italy,\u201d the man says.\n\nData from WHO shows the claims are false. Firstly, the global mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2.93 percent a month ago and not 0.2 percent as claimed.\n\nBased on the latest WHO situation report, the COVID-19 mortality rate for Italy is 9.3 percent. Going by Italy\u2019s mortality rate, which is the highest globally, if Nigeria\u2019s estimated 200-million population were to contract COVID-19, the number of estimated deaths still falls way below 45 million.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control told AFP the voice note and its claims were \u201cfalse\u201d.\n\nThe centre has reported 40 cases with only one casualty -- keeping local mortality at 2.5 percent as of March 24, 2020.\n\nDaniel Meshak, a public health specialist at Jos University Teaching Hospital, also dismissed the possibility of the virus killing 45 million Nigerians.\n\n\"Mortality is dependent on the kind of supportive care you get from the hospital so there is a need to be cautious\", he told AFP.\n\nThe sender also claims that Nigeria wants to purchase protective gear from China but lacks the financial reserves.\n\n\u201cNigeria wants to buy used protective gear\u2026 from China... for N32,000 ($85 or \u20ac79) and they can\u2019t purchase the new one because we are actually broke, Nigeria doesn\u2019t have anything in their reserves anymore\u201d, the sender claims.\n\nHe alleges President Muhammadu Buhari has spent state funds and \u201cwhat every state is waiting for is for the World Bank to release money\u201d.\n\nAccording to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Nigeria had $35.9 billion in its reserves as of March 19, 2020. Central bank governor Godwin Emefiele said on March 18 that the bank would boost the economy with a N1 trillion stimulus, with an additional N100 billion ($264.5 million) loan to the health sector.\n\nNigeria\u2019s foreign reserves have fallen from $38.5 billion at the beginning of 2020 to $35.9 billion, but the reserves were nowhere near empty as of when the voice note started making the rounds.\n\nNCDC also told AFP there were no plans underway to buy used protective gear from China.\n\nThe sender claims his source was a certain \u201cDr Alemu\u201d, a female Rwandan national and the WHO\u2019s representative in Nigeria.\n\nHe alleges the NCDC reports to the doctor who then passed on the information.\n\nHowever, WHO spokeswoman Charity Warigon told AFP the claims were untrue.\n\nShe said that although Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu was a real person, he was neither a woman nor from Rwanda. Warigon also confirmed that the NCDC was not reporting to him.\n\nDr Alemu is an Ethiopian-American doctor who was appointed the WHO country representative in Nigeria in December 2016. He left Nigeria in 2018 -- more than a year before the outbreak of coronavirus disease.\n\nDr Fiona Braka has been named the WHO\u2019s temporary officer-in-charge until a new country representative has been appointed, Warigon said. Braka is a member of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Nigeria.\n\nWarigon also rejected the sender\u2019s claim that he was a former UN volunteer.\n\n\u201cThe only UN volunteer we have is here [in our office], and she is the first we have in Nigeria. It is false information, absolutely false,\u201d she said.\n\nWarigon also warned that the circulation of false claims was hampering the fight against the coronavirus.\n\n\"Instead of creating fear in people or giving misinformation, it is better to sensitise people on safety measures\u201d, she said.", "lang": "en"}
