The archived version of the post can be seen here\n\nAFWA has found that the screen grab posted with the claim has nothing to do with bank holidays. The document reads \"Real-time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System - Extension of Timing for Customer Transaction\". In the second paragraph, it is written, \"It has been decided to extend timings for customer transaction in RTGS\"\n\nThe original document shared by Mir Imtiyaz regarding RTGS timing is present on the website of RBI and can be seen here.\n\nAs the same claim has been doing the rounds on social media since 2017, RBI had decided to come out with a clarification. AFWA found an RBI press release issued on April 20, 2019, refuting the social media claim.\n\nIt reads, \"It has been reported in certain sections of the media that commercial banks would have a five-day week in terms of RBI instructions. It is clarified that this information is not factually correct. RBI has not issued any such directions.\"\n\nAccording to RBI, \"RTGS stands for Real Time Gross Settlement. It is a system where there is continuous and real-time settlement of fund-transfers. 'Real Time' means processing the instructions at the time they are received; 'Gross Settlement' means that the settlement of funds transfer instructions occurs individually.\"\n\nA large section of the media has reported about it. A few fact check websites have also debunked the claim in the past.", "lang": "en"}
