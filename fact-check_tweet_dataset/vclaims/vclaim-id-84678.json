The claim is false; the video was in fact filmed in Germany in 2011, nearly a decade before the coronavirus pandemic broke out.\n\nThe video has been viewed nearly 5,000 times since it was posted to Twitter here on March 1.\n\nThe tweet reads: \u201c#CoronaVirusUpdate Scenes from Germany! #coronavirus fears in Germany result in large crowds outside a supermarket. People pushing each other to get into store firstmto get necessary supplies . #COVID19 #COVID2019\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video was also shared alongside similar claims on Twitter here, here and here; and on YouTube here and here. Several posts claim the footage was filmed in various European countries, such as the UK, Spain and Belgium.\n\nPanic buying has been reported worldwide during the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 8,600 people and infected over 200,000 others globally, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe claims, however, about the rush on the ALDI supermarket are false.\n\nA reverse image search using video keyframes extracted with InVid, a digital verification tool co-developed by AFP, found the same video was published here on YouTube in January 2011.\n\nThe video, titled \u201cALDI special sale in Kiel - from 2011 !!\u201d, shows a store named F.B.I adjacent to the supermarket.\n\nALDI and F.B.I, a German hairdresser chain, both have branches at the Citti-Park shopping mall in Kiel, a northern German city.\n\nThe map on Citti-Park\u2019s website shows ALDI and F.B.I. located next to each other, see here and here.\n\nPhotos on Google Maps also provide further evidence that the video was shot outside the ALDI in Citti-Park. While recent images, such as this photo dated Ocotber 2019, show that the F.B.I logo has changed, older photos, such as this one from September 2016, feature the same logo seen in the video.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and a recent photo geotagged to the ALDI in Citti-Park on Google Maps (R) with corresponding elements circled in red by AFP:", "lang": "en"}
