President Donald Trump pointed out Carryn Owens in the gallery during his speech before Congress on Feb. 28.\n\nThe UndergroundNewsReport.com article doesn\u2019t mention the Owens family by name, but it does use a fabricated quote from Goldberg.\n\n\"She was just looking for attention. These military widows love their 15 minutes in the spotlight,\" Goldberg is quoted as saying. \"If it were me I wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the house. How can someone who is truly grieving go out there and be on TV. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me\"\n\nAs part of its efforts to eliminate fake news in users\u2019 news feeds, Facebook alerted us that the story might be made up \u2014 and it is.\n\nThe author of the story told PunditFact that every story on UndergroundNewsReport.com is bogus. James McDaniel, who told us that he is an American who lives in Costa Rica, said he made them up first as a joke, then used them to try and rile Trump supporters who believed the articles without verifying them.\n\nThe site contains a disclaimer that says all articles \"are fiction, and presumably fake news.\" There currently is a link at the end of the story that redirects readers to an explanation that the website is trying to fool its readers.\n\nAs of this writing, the Goldberg story had 348 comments, and had been shared on Facebook well over 56,000 times. The same story has popped up on other sites that have copied it, with no indication that it is fake.\n\nThe entire experiment was never meant to be serious, McDaniel said, but he decided to quit posting new articles once he saw how far-reaching his fabrications had become online.\n\n\"I might have carried on a bit longer because I was having fun, but people took the Whoopi Goldberg story so seriously and it had gotten so big I thought I had better pull the plug,\" McDaniel wrote via email.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
