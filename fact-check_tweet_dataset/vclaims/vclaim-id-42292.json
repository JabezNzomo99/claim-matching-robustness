In the one-minute clip, a person dressed in traditional thobe can be heard saying that he believes Kashmir is \u201cHindu land\u201d. The clip is circulated in the backdrop of the recent dilution of Article 370.\n\nAnother widely used caption that accompanies this video says, \u201cOpinion of Saudi Prince On Kashmir Issue . See How Beautifully & Convincingly , He Expresses His Frank Opinion. Lovely Slap On Pakistan\u2019s Face By Super Saudi Prince . Thanks For Expressing The Reality In Quite An Unambiguous Terms.\u201d \u201cMy position on the Kashmir issue is very clear. I am not a politician. I only care about history and religion. I know that Islam came to India much later than Hinduism (which) had already existed. Pakistan claimed independence way after all this happened, 70 years ago. So I don\u2019t think Pakistani is a suitable negotiator regarding Kashmir. I don\u2019t even think they have the right to speak. I believe its Hindu land. That\u2019s very controversial. Many will say no, they have the right to have their opinions. My position is that Kashmir is Hindu land and I say this in front of everyone. I\u2019m not just saying this because I am in India. This has been my opinion for five years. Even when I was an extremist this was my opinion. So nobody can say that I am being paid by Modi or anything like that,\u201d is the full speech of the man.\n\nThis video was also massively shared on social media earlier in February after the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman\u2019s visit to India.From a Facebook page Proud to be India, the video had over 1.86 lakh views.\n\nThe man in the viral video is not a Saudi prince but Imam Tawhidi, an Iranian-born Australian Shia Muslim Imam. Tawhidi himself clarified the same on Twitter.\n\nTawhidi, who runs his Twitter account from the handle @imamofpeace, was in India in February for the Arth Fest of art and culture in Delhi.\n\nArth uploaded the complete video of his speech. At 54:44 minutes, a person from the audience asked Tawhidi \u2013 \u201chow do we protect the peaceful Muslim population from Wahabism in Kashmir\u201d. Tawhidi\u2019s reply to this question was the one-minute clip viral on social media.\n\nThe viral video is, thus, being circulated with a false narrative. It does not depict the opinion of a Saudi prince but that of Imam Tawhidi.\n\n[This article was updated on August 7, 2019, when it resurfaced on social media with the claim.]", "lang": "en"}
