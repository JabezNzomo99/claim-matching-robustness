You must keep up the attack on the media. You\u2019ve got to keep destroying their credibility.\u201d President Trump: You know why I do it (attack the media)? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so that when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you.\u201d\n\nThese quotes are both largely accurate.\n\nThe quote from Nixon appears to be a mash-up of two different statements from him. Nixon, who served as president from 1969 until his resignation in 1974, said \u201cthe press is the enemy\u201d during a December 1972 phone call with his National Security Advisers Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig. Nixon repeated this phrase three times before telling his security advisers to write it 100 times on the blackboard to commit it to memory:\n\nThe remainder of this quote \u2014 \u201cYou must keep up the attack on the media. You\u2019ve got to keep destroying their credibility\u201d \u2014 comes from a call Nixon had with his special counsel Charles Colson:\n\nTrump, like Nixon, frequently rails against what he calls the \u201cfake news\u201d media. Readers will be able to find plenty of examples of Trump disparaging the press in interviews, during rally speeches, and on his Twitter feed.\n\nThe quote included in this meme comes from \u201c60 Minutes\u201d journalist Leslie Stahl. After Trump won the 2016 presidential election, he sat down with Stahl for an interview on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Before the tapes started rolling, Stahl and Trump talked about his attacks on the media.\n\nStahl recalled the conversation during an appearance in front of the journalist group the Deadline Club of New York in May 2018. Stahl begins talking about this quote around the 21:10 mark of the following video:\n\nStahl said she and her boss met with Trump at his office in Trump Tower in Manhattan after the 2016 election in advance of a recorded sit-down interview for \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cAt one point, he started to attack the press,\u201d Stahl said. \u201cThere were no cameras in there.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018You know, this is getting tired. Why are you doing it over and over? It\u2019s boring and it\u2019s time to end that. You know, you\u2019ve won \u2026 why do you keep hammering at this?\u2019\u201d Stahl recalled. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018You know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so that when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you.\u2019\u201d Stahl paused for a moment after quoting Trump to the assembled journalists. \u201cHe said that,\u201d Stahl noted. \u201cSo, put that in your head for a minute. Yeah.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
