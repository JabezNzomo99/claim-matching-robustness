The original included only the phrase \u201cFirst Ex President to Publicly Speak Against a Successor\u201d:\n\n\ufeffThe claim, that no ex-president before Barack Obama ever publicly criticized his immediate successor is false. There is ample historical evidence of ex-presidents doing just that. Here are a few instances:\n\nThe 44th president offered what were widely perceived as thinly-veiled criticisms of President Donald Trump when he spoke in Johannesburg, South Africa, in July 2018, railing against what he called \u201cstrongman politics,\u201d whereby \u201cthose in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning.\u201d He also criticized \u201cfar-right parties\u201d with a platform of \u201cprotectionism and closed borders\u201d as well as \u201cbarely-hidden racial nationalism.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the University of Illinois in September, Obama criticized Trump by name, saying he was a \u201csymptom, not a cause\u201d of an effort by powerful elites to engender fear and division in the face of social change and progress:\n\nObama had declined to openly attack Trump for the first 18 months of his presidency, following what, in his University of Illinois speech, he called the \u201cwise American tradition of ex-presidents gracefully exiting the political stage.\u201d Obama said he had changed his mind because, in his view, the 2018 mid-term elections represented \u201cone of those pivotal moments when every one of us, as citizens of the United States, need to determine just who it is that we are, just what it is that we stand for.\u201d\n\nIn July 2007, the 42nd president took aim at the administration of his successor, George W. Bush, in its handling of the Iraq war, telling Good Morning America\u2018s Diane Sawyer \u201cThere is no military victory here\u201d and criticizing Bush for attempting to filibuster Congressional efforts to bring about a withdrawal of troops:\n\nAlthough George H.W. Bush had a general policy of not speaking publicly against his successor, the 41st president did just that more than once while campaigning for Republican candidates during the 1994 mid-term elections.\n\nThe Daily Oklahoman newspaper reported that Bush Sr. had offered a stinging counter-attack against Clinton during a visit to the state capital on 4 November 1994:\n\nDuring a Republican rally in Omaha, Nebraska, the same week, Bush attacked Clinton for having \u201cthe nerve\u201d to blame the GOP for \u201chis own failures,\u201d the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\n reported:\n\nIn 1999, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Clinton\u2019s impeachment by the U.S. House of Representatives, Bush even appeared to accuse his successor of behaving in a way which demonstrated a lack of respect for the U.S. presidency, as the Associated Press reported:\n\nThe 39th president more than once criticized Ronald Reagan, the man who defeated him in the 1980 presidential campaign, firmly defending his own record and offering relatively barbed comments about his successor.\n\nIn September 1982, Carter responded to Reagan\u2019s earlier criticisms of the Democrat\u2019s legacy, accusing his rival of failing to \u201caccept his responsibilities as president,\u201d the New York Times reported:\n\nAt a press conference two months later, Carter continued that theme, saying Reagan\u2019s efforts to deflect criticism onto him were \u201cirresponsible and ill-advised\u201d and that his Republican successor had made \u201cradical\u201d and unwelcome changes to U.S. foreign policy, United Press International reported:\n\nJimmy Carter criticized President Reagan for making \u2018radical\u2019 changes in U.S. foreign and domestic policy, and said Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin is responsible in part for failure of the Camp David accords. In a wide-ranging news conference, Carter also twitted Reagan for trying to lay the blame for the nation\u2019s problems on the previous administration. \u2018There is always the temptation for an incumbent politician to blame all his mistakes on his predecessor. Most are willing to withstand the temptation. Mr. Reagan, apparently, is not,\u2019 Carter said. \u2018The public sees through that and the results of the (midterm) election proves I\u2019m right\u2019 \u2026 Speaking typically with a soft voice but strong words, Carter said: \u201cMost of the quite radical departures in foreign, domestic and economic policy have not been good for the country. We have an unprecedented number of people unemployed; bankruptcies are the highest in years; farm income is at the lowest level ever; the deficits have never been so high, and so forth\u201d \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s true President Reagan inherited some serious problems from my administration. I inherited some from President Ford. But to try to forego blame and say all these problems are my predecessor\u2019s fault is patently irresponsible and ill-advised,\u201d he said. Carter called Reagan\u2019s nuclear policies \u2018ill-advised.\u2019\n\nJust as Carter publicly took aim at the man who replaced him in the White House, he was also the subject of repeated and sometimes very strong criticism by Republican Gerald Ford, whom Carter had defeated in the 1976 election.\n\nIn April 1977, less than three months after Carter succeeded him, Ford ridiculed the Democrat\u2019s economic policies in a widely-syndicated interview with the Washington Post:\n\nOver the next three years, Ford also took aim at Carter\u2019s handling of negotiations over the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT), his handling of the economic crisis, and in the summer of 1980 he launched a devastating attack on his successor\u2019s legacy at a Republican event in Indianapolis, as the Associated Press reported:\n\nThe examples highlighted above are far from exhaustive but serve to illustrate that Barack Obama\u2019s recent criticisms of President Donald Trump are far from unique or unprecedented and, especially when compared to the pronouncements of Gerald Ford, could even be argued to have been relatively tame.\n\nAs such, the claim in the 2017 meme which re-emerged in November 2018, that Obama is \u201cthe first ex-president to publicly speak against a successor\u201d is false.", "lang": "en"}
