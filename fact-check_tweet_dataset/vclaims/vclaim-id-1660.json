Four homeless people died of exposure in the first 10 days of 2017. A week after the baby was found, it\u2019s still unclear whether he died of exposure hours after being born outdoors or was stillborn.\n\nThis report is true, and was filed by a legitimate news organization. However, a photograph that was quickly attached to the already-shocking story in order to make it into a meme is not related to the incident:\n\nThis image was taken in 2013 and shows a homeless man in Washington, D.C.:\n\nThe meme about the woman and her baby also spread the claim that the baby froze to death and did not die from a cause unrelated to the cold, which has been debated. First responders had previously reported that the child was alive when it was found, but the state\u2019s medical examiner said that the infant was actually stillborn:\n\nFirst responders told colleagues in text messages that the baby was \u201cconscious and breathing OK, but has been outside this entire time\u201d and was \u201cice cold.\u201d The child was \u201cborn in a transient camp,\u201d one message said. The baby was taken to the hospital and later pronounced dead. Meanwhile, police said the infant\u2019s 34-year-old mother showed signs of mental illness, telling investigators that she became pregnant by \u201cimmaculate conception.\u201d Although two emergency room doctors reportedly told investigators that the baby \u201cappeared to \u2018be viable,'\u201d the state\u2019s medical examiner, Dr. Karin Gunson, said the infant was stillborn after performing an autopsy.\n\nThere are many factors to this story, none less tragic than any other \u2014 the fact that many people on the streets of Portland, Oregon (as in many parts of the United States) suffer from untreated mental illness; that this 9 January 2017 death was not the first of the year from possible exposure in the local homeless population, nor even the second, but the fifth; or that the mother of the dead baby is now nowhere to be found. However, this particular meme not only oversimplifies the issue, but uses a misleading photograph in order to do so.", "lang": "en"}
