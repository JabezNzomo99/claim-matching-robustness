And we have to actually coach them and kind of teach them what it\u2019s like to live alone and be an NBA professional player.\"\n\nThe Bucks certainly are young. The two most recent draft picks were Greek teenager Giannis Antetokounmpo (now 20) and rookie forward Jabari Parker, who left Duke after his freshman season.\n\nTime to dial up the rosters.\n\nThe Golden Eagles have a somewhat different lineup from when the season began. Marquette lost two players, Deonte Burton, 20, and John Dawson, 19, who left the team in December 2014 and were replaced by a pair of walk-ons -- twins Michael and Matthew Mache, 21.\n\nThe average age of the Golden Eagles at the start of the season was 20.4 years old; it\u2019s now 20.9.\n\nAccording to NBA.com, at the start of the season the Bucks were the second youngest team in the NBA with an average age of 23.7. The team was second to the Philadelphia 76ers, with an average age of 23.4 years, and just ahead of four teams -- New Orleans, Minnesota, Boston and Orlando -- all tied with an average age of 24.9.\n\nA couple of birthdays pushed the Bucks\u2019 average age to 24 years old at the time of Feigin\u2019s claim.\n\nSo, in terms of the average age, Feigin clanked one off the rim.\n\nHis broader point, of course, was that the Bucks team is very young.\n\nSome other comparisons with the Marquette team underscore that point. For instance, the Golden Eagles have only one teenager -- 19-year-old Sandy Cohen III, a freshman -- on their 10 man roster. Four are age 21.\n\nThe Bucks have two teens -- Parker and Damien Inglis. (Both are out for the season with injuries but remain on the roster.) Antetokounmpo, in his second season, turned 20 in December 2014.\n\nAlso, four Bucks players are under the age of 22, which makes them younger than some of the Marquette players. Also eight players -- more than half the team -- are under the age of 24.\n\nThe average age of the Bucks is skewed a bit by six players over the age of 26, including the oldest Buck, center Zaza Pachulia, who is 30.\n\nIn building the case for a new arena, Feigin says his team will become more engaged with the community -- and that the young Bucks were learning about life as professional ballplayers.\n\nThe team did start the season as the second youngest of 30 NBA teams. But the claim we are looking at is whether they are younger on average than the Marquette squad. They are not.", "lang": "en"}
