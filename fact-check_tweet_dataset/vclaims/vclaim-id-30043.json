The event dealt with a hypothetical scenario involving a fictional virus.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously explained that the outbreak of a respiratory disease that began in Wuhan, China, is from a new coronavirus, and that the term \u201ccoronavirus\u201d refers to a group of viruses, not one unique strain. The virus now spreading is being referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV.\n\nBut online headlines shared on social media have capitalized on the generic term \u201ccoronavirus\u201d to falsely suggest that organizations in the public health space made predictions about the new virus even before the outbreak began in December.\n\nAmid the news about the new virus, the conspiracy theory website InfoWars ran a Jan. 24 headline, since picked up elsewhere, that claimed: \u201cBILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION & OTHERS PREDICTED UP TO 65 MILLION DEATHS VIA CORONAVIRUS \u2014 IN SIMULATION RAN 3 MONTHS AGO!\u201d\n\n\u201cFoundation also funded group who owns virus patent and is funding research for a vaccine to stop it from spreading,\u201d a misleading subhead reads.\n\nThere was in fact an exercise (called \u201cEvent 201\u201d) that took place in October that was hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security \u2014 which the Gates Foundation participated in \u2014 that focused on emergency preparedness in the event of a \u201cvery severe pandemic.\u201d But it didn\u2019t deal with 2019-nCoV, and it didn\u2019t make real-life predictions about death tolls.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction,\u201d the center said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people. Although our tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the event centered on a made-up coronavirus \u2014 and not one with the same features of the virus currently spreading. The fictionalized scenario involved a disease starting in pig farms in Brazil and spreading around the world, leading to 65 million deaths. Again, that was all made up for the simulation. Videos of, and information on, the event are easily accessible online; the Center for Health Security has hosted similar events in the past, too.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that such a simulation would have focused on a type of coronavirus, said David Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University and faculty member of the university\u2019s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories.\n\nHamer said the goal of such a simulation \u2014 which often brings together representatives from across disciplines such as academia, public health and government \u2014 \u201cis to present an unknown scenario and have the groups work in teams to develop an emergency response.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can be pretty intense. The designers try to make them very realistic,\u201d he told FactCheck.org. \u201cRespiratory viruses like coronavirus, like SARS, like MERS are good examples to use in a format like this because of the facility in which they can spread.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, it\u2019s important to distinguish a disease like 2019-nCoV as just one virus in a larger classification: \u201cThis is a relatively common family of viruses, but there is quite a range of pathogenicity in the family.\u201d\n\nThe claim that the Gates Foundation \u201cfunded group who owns virus patent and is funding research for a vaccine to stop it from spreading\u201d is similarly misleading.\n\nThe patent the InfoWars story links to \u2014 No. 10,130,701 \u2014 is for a mutated form of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a different coronavirus that infects poultry, but not people, as we\u2019ve explained before. That patent was filed by the Pirbright Institute \u2014 a research institute in the U.K. that works to prevent viral diseases of livestock \u2014 and the mutations were created to weaken the virus so that it could be used as a vaccine to protect chickens from IBV.\n\nMatthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland, told us previously that that patent has nothing \u201cto do with the new 2019-nCoV virus.\u201d\n\nPirbright, addressing misinformation about its patent, said that the organization \u201cdoes not currently work with human coronaviruses\u201d and that its \u201cresearch is focused on animal coronaviruses, primarily chickens.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Institute holds Patent no. 10130701 which covers the development of an attenuated (weakened) form of the coronavirus that could potentially be used as a vaccine to prevent respiratory diseases in birds and other animals,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cMany vaccines are made in this way, from flu to polio. We have not yet developed an IBV vaccine, but research is ongoing.\u201d\n\nPirbright has received continued funding from the Gates Foundation, including for its Livestock Antibody Hub, but said its \u201cpatented work was not funded\u201d by the foundation.\n\nThe Gates Foundation routinely gives money to combat diseases, including for vaccine development and delivery. It recently announced it would commit $10 million in funds and technical support to help the responders in China and Africa contain the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
