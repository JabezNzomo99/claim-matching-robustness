This is not comparable to a rank-and-file service member in the military. But for the purpose of this fact-check, we wanted to know who was \u201cabsolutely\u201d correct. We consulted about a dozen retired military lawyers, and here\u2019s what we found.\n\nFBI Director James B. Comey decided not to recommend criminal charges against Clinton after the agency\u2019s investigation of her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. But Comey said Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified material and that \u201cany reasonable person\u201d in her position should have known better.\n\nComey said that in 110 emails, there was information that was sensitive enough to be classified at the time the messages were sent or received. Clinton has said it was a mistake to use a private server, and she now says she believed none of the emails were classified because the documents didn\u2019t have classified header markings. (For more details on the Clinton email controversy and classified information in her emails, see our roundup of 14 fact-checks: wapo.st/ClintonEmailFacts)\n\nProsecutors weigh a variety of factors before bringing charges, especially whether there is evidence regarding intent. Other cases involving mishandling or removing classified information that were prosecuted involved some combination of \u201cclearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here,\u201d Comey said, adding that investigators \u201ccannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges\u201d against Clinton.\n\nCommanders are the convening authority to send cases to court-martial. But commanders also are guided by the military principle to \u201cresolve problems and seek answers at the lowest possible level.\u201d That means commanders may decide to pursue administrative remedies rather than taking the matter to a full trial. The administrative action would depend on each service member\u2019s disciplinary history, the evidence available and prosecutorial discretion.\n\nA service member might be court-martialed if the circumstances were sufficiently egregious. But cases in which someone is found to be careless \u2014 like Clinton \u2014 usually end up in an administrative remedy, such as a letter of reprimand, said Dru Brenner-Beck, president of the National Institute of Military Justice and a retired Army JAG officer. Administrative actions, such as losing a rank, being forced out of the service or being issued a letter of reprimand, can be career-ending.\n\nOthers said being \u201cextremely careless\u201d with classified information could certainly end up in courts-martial and that Pence was correct. Experts who agreed with Pence said there are strict military regulations for the handling of classified materials, and the standard would be higher for someone who should have \u201cknown better,\u201d as Comey said about Clinton. But even those who agreed with Pence could not recall a specific court-martial case that was directly comparable to Clinton\u2019s.\n\nEric Montalvo, a founding partner of Federal Practice Group and a retired Marine Corps JAG officer, pointed to a case of an Army specialist whom he represented. The specialist had faced an array of charges at court-martial, including one that related to her alleged failure to follow orders about sending classified information. The specialist lacked sufficient training to access or use the classified network, he said. He said the case illustrates how a low-level soldier could be held responsible in ways that do not apply to a Cabinet-level secretary.\n\nSaucier is a Navy sailor who was sentenced to prison after taking photos in classified areas of a nuclear submarine. He then destroyed the evidence after learning that he was under investigation. Saucier\u2019s lawyers compared Saucier\u2019s case to Clinton\u2019s emails to say he \u201cpossessed six (6) photographs classified as \u2018confidential/restricted,\u2019 far less than Clinton\u2019s 110 emails,\u201d but the judge was unconvinced by this argument. Saucier\u2019s lawyers also acknowledged that the two cases were different: Saucier admitted knowing that what he was doing was illegal, unlike Clinton, CNN reported.\n\nThe facts tip in Kaine\u2019s favor. Even the experts who agreed with Pence could not recall a specific court-martial case that was directly comparable to Clinton\u2019s. Technically, yes, a service member can be court-martialed for behavior like Clinton\u2019s, but it\u2019s more likely the person would face administrative action. And the administrative action would depend on each service member\u2019s disciplinary history, the evidence available and prosecutorial discretion. While readers pointed out the Saucier and Brezler cases, Saucier\u2019s own lawyers acknowledged that his case was not like Clinton\u2019s, and Brezler\u2019s case is still in court.\n\nPence and Kaine spoke in absolute terms during the debate, but the reality is much less absolute. Kaine would have been on more solid ground if he had simply responded \u201cthat\u2019s a ridiculous comparison\u201d or if he had challenged Pence to point to a specific case. Instead, he flat-out denied it was possible. We award both Pence and Kaine Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
