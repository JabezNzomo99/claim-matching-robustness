No, that's just a headline put out by some clickbait website citing two pieces of old research that don't actually make any claims about that. The headline is entirely false.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Higher Perspective on September 10, 2018 titled \"New research says short people are angrier and more violent than tall people\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nResearchers at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, recently quizzed 600 men aged between 18 and 50 on the perception of male gender, self-image and behavior in relation to drug-taking, violence and crime for a government-led study. The scientists found that men who feel the least masculine are most at risk of committing violent or criminal acts. According to the study, men who considered themselves less masculine, also known as \"male discrepancy stress,\" were nearly three times more likely to have committed violent assaults with a weapon or assaults leading to an injury. A few years ago, a team of researchers at Oxford University also claimed \"Short Man Syndrome\" is a real thing.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe research may be interesting but it is definitely not \"new\" for starters. The paper the article cites (\"Masculine Discrepancy Stress, Substance Use, Assault, and Injury in a Survey of U.S. Men\") already dates from 2015 and it is based on questioning 600 men via an online service (so it is not even 100% certain they actually were men...). None of the questions concerned height and the paper doesn't even use the words \"height\" or \"tall\". All it claimed to investigate was something called \"masculine discrepancy stress\" and the influence it had on substance abuse, assault and injuries. It defined \"masculine discrepancy stress\" as:\n\nIn other words, men who think they are less manly than the accepted norm in society and who think other men are noticing it will suffer from some kind of stress as a result. The paper then goes on to investigate if this makes those men more violent, more accident-prone or more likely to engage in substance abuse.\n\nThe clickbait piece then also references a short article from 2014 linking to several news articles about an experiment that showed how lowering the height of someone in a VR experiment increased feelings of paranoia and vulnerability:\n\nAt least this is about height but it doesn't mention violence at all.\n\nSo in summary, the article at Higher Perspective has:\n\u2022 Two old pieces of research\n\u2022 One not about height\n\u2022 One not about violence\n\nTo go from that to claiming \"new\" research says something about the relation between height and violence seems like a stretch to us...\n\nAnd Higher Perspective seems to agree with us that what they are doing is not really scientifc.
