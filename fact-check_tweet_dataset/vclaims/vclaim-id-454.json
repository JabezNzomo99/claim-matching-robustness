As noted in a 2001 medical article on lightning injuries and burns: Direct [lightning] strikes occur when the victims are outside, often carrying metal objects, such as an umbrella. Metal (e.g., a hairpin) worn in the hair increases the chances of a direct strike compared with a metal object worn lower on the body. Although not always fatal, direct strikes are associated with high morbidity, because they frequently involve the head. Lightning strikes near the head may enter the eyes, ears, and mouth to cause multiple problems. Lightning can cause mild to severe damage to numerous body systems. Although the current from lightning may flow through the victim\u2019s body for only a short time, it can short-circuit the body\u2019s electrical systems, such as the heart and the respiratory center of the brain.\n\u2022 Most victims who survive lightning strikes actually experience not the type of direct hit shown here but rather what is known as a A side flash (also called a side splash) occurs when lightning strikes a taller object near the victim and a portion of the current jumps from taller object to the victim. In essence, the person acts as a \u201cshort circuit: for some of energy in the lightning discharge. Side flashes generally occur when the victim is within a foot or two of the object that is struck. Most often, side flash victims have taken shelter under a tree to avoid rain or hail.\n\u2022 Each lightning flash appears only in a single frame of the video, without whiting out (or otherwise saturating) the camera image and without illuminating or reflecting from other objects In the scene, suggestive of images of electrical discharges being overlaid onto ordinary video of a man walking.\n\u2022 Despite the extraordinary nature of the events supposedly depicted in the video, and the fact that it was all documented on camera (including the exact date and location) in a video that has seen wide circulation, no news outlet ever reported on the incident or identified the circumstances under which it occurred. \n\n\n\nThe following video features a technical deconstruction of the original:", "lang": "en"}
