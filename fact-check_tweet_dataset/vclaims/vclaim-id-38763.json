It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the amount of gambling has grown by that amount.\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s worth noting that the NAO figures show that the yield from licensed gambling (which is the revenue generated minus the winnings paid out) grew by 40% in the decade to 2018/19. The figure reported by the BBC, of 57% growth over that period, is the figure after excluding the National Lottery, as the NAO report makes clear.\n\nMore importantly, this shouldn\u2019t be taken to mean that people are gambling more, because much of this growth comes from changes to the regulation of online gambling in 2014.\n\nBefore November 2014, online gambling based outside of Great Britain did not need to be licensed and regulated and so revenue from that did not show up in the Gambling Commission\u2019s figures before then.\n\nIn 2013/14, the last full year before the regulation change, the gross gambling yield from online gambling was \u00a31.2 billion and had been between \u00a3700 million and \u00a31 billion for a few years. (These figures are adjusted for inflation, so they reflect the change in the value of money over time.)\n\nThen in 2014/15 (the year the regulations changed), the yield from online gambling doubled to \u00a32.4 billion.\n\nIn 2015/16, the first full year the new regulations were active, the yield was \u00a34.5 billion.\n\nOnline gambling yield has continued to increase since then, but at a slower rate, to \u00a35.3 billion in 2018/19.\n\nIf you look at the change in the gambling yield excluding online gambling, it\u2019s actually fallen by 2% over the last decade, from \u00a39.3 billion to \u00a39 billion.\n\nSo the boom observed in the past decade may have been created largely by the change in regulations, not by a real change in people\u2019s behaviour. We don\u2019t know how much it would have grown if online gambling had been classified consistently across that time.\n\nThis is further supported by the evidence on gambling behaviour.\n\nThe Gambling Commission runs an annual survey which suggests that the amount of gambling taking place isn\u2019t increasing much.\n\nIn 2015, 45% of respondents said they had gambled in the four weeks prior to being surveyed. In 2019 the figure was 47%. Also the frequency of gambling appears to be decreasing over time. Fewer people reported gambling at least once a week, while the proportion saying they gamble more than once a month, but less the once a week, has increased.\n\nThe Gambling Commission doesn\u2019t ask people how much they spend on average, but data from the Office for National Statistics also suggests this hasn\u2019t changed much either in recent years and has fallen over the longer term.\n\nOver roughly the same period that licensed gambling yield increased by 40% , the average household spend on gambling fell 33%. Both figures are adjusted for inflation.", "lang": "en"}
