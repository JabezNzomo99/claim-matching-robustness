But because they had issues with the law even a known political ally such as an Aquino failed to approve their renewal.\"\n\nFacts: Since March, the House of Representatives, from which franchise laws are supposed to originate, has held only one hearing on the ABS-CBN franchise. None of the congressmen present during the hearing cited ABS-CBN's pay-per-view service as the reason for the non-renewal of their franchise.\n\nCayetano, who ran and lost the 2016 vice presidential race, had accused the network of giving unfair airtime to other candidates during the campaign period. His standard-bearer, Rodrigo Duterte, had also accused the network of swindling him for not running his campaign ads in 2016.\n\nCayetano said in February that discussing the franchise renewal would be \"tedious, contentious, and it [would threaten] to drain the momentum that has allowed the 18th Congress to accomplish so much\" but did not expound on the network's violations that had to be discussed.\n\nSection 1 of the franchise, Republic Act No. 7966, says that, \"[...] ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, hereunder referred to as the grantee, its successors or assigns, is hereby granted a franchise to construct, operate and maintain, for commercial purposes and in the public interest, television and radio broadcasting stations in and throughout the Philippines, through microwave, satellite or whatever means including the use of any new technologies in television and radio systems, with the corresponding technological auxiliaries or facilities, special broadcast and other broadcast distribution services and relay stations.\"\n\nHowever, Cordoba said that ABS-CBN is subject to a P200 fine under Commonwealth Act No. 146 or the Public Service Act because KBO became available before the NTC was able to issue guidelines for it. According to Chapter IV, Section 21 of the law, public services that violate any regulations are subject to a fine of P200 per day for every day of their violation.", "lang": "en"}
