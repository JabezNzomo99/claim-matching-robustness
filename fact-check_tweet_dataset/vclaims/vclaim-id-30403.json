We rated that outdated claim Four Pinocchios: Not only is the United States not being hurt by China\u2019s current currency manipulation, China also is not devaluing its currency anymore. In fact, China is selling foreign currency to prop up its own, in an effort to prevent the yuan from depreciating further and destabilizing the Chinese and global economy. Yet on April 2, Trump insisted to the Financial Times that \u201cour country hasn\u2019t had a clue, they haven\u2019t had a clue\u201d about China\u2019s alleged currency manipulations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Trump told Bloomberg News in August 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-way street also. It\u2019s sort of a featherbedding for politicians and others, and a few companies. And these are companies that can do very well without it. So I don\u2019t like it. I think it\u2019s a lot of excess baggage. I think it\u2019s unnecessary. And when you think about free enterprise it\u2019s really not free enterprise. I\u2019d be against it.\u201d\n\nOn whether he knows Putin\n\nOn whether to pursue a tax code overhaul\n\nAfter failing to rally enough Republican votes in support of the GOP replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act, Trump announced he was moving on from health care to pursue a tax code overhaul. He said on March 24, the day House Speaker Paul D. Ryan pulled the doomed bill: \u201cWe\u2019ll be going right now for tax reform, which we could have done earlier, but this really would have worked out better if we could have had some Democrat support. Remember this: We had no Democrat support. So now we\u2019re going to go for tax reform, which I\u2019ve always liked.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
