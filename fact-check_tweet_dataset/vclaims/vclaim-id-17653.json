Now, even animals do not like Congress),\u201d is a message viral on social media, accompanying a video that shows a man, trying to get atop a camel\u2019s back, falling off the animal. From a Facebook profile of one Kanak Mishra, the video had 3,000 shares at the time of writing this article.\n\nRajesh Jindal, who was found running the fake news website hindutva.info, has also posted the clip on Facebook.\n\nThe video has been doing rounds on social media since March.\n\nIt was also viral with the English text \u2013 \u201cRajasthani Congress leader Hari Singh started his prachar.\u201d\n\nThe clip was circulated on WhatsApp as well.\n\nThere is no Congress MLA named Hari Singh\n\nTo authenticate the veracity of the claim, Alt News first checked if the Congress party has any incumbent MLA named Hari Sigh. My Neta, a website that contains details about state and central legislators, did not include any information about the said person. \u2018Congress MLA Hari Singh\u2019 was, therefore, a piece of fabricated information used to propagate a false narrative.\n\nIf one notices carefully, the video has a stamp of the media app Tik Tok. The username of the person who posted the video was \u2018nadeemmg07\u2019.\n\nUpon searching the username on Google, we were able to trace back the video to 2018 when it was uploaded by a user \u2018nadeemmg07\u2019, now changed to \u2018nadeemmg04\u2019.\n\nIn conversation with India Today, Nadeem revealed that the video was shot in his village Sawayaya Hasan near Unchahar in Raebareli, Uttar Pradesh. Speaking to locals from the village, India Today found that the man who fell off the camel\u2019s back was one Vakil Ahmed Khan and the incident took place during Diwali last year at a wedding. Khan confirmed that it was indeed him in the viral video.\n\nRecently, another fictitious Congress MLA found a place not only in the fake news ecosystem on social media but also in mainstream media. A video of a man praising PM Modi was picked up by Republic TVand broadcast on its \u2018Hello Bharat\u2019 program as Congress MLA Anil Upadhyay praising the Prime Minister. It was later found that the man was a mere BJP supporter and his name was Mohan (Munna) Pandey.", "lang": "en"}
