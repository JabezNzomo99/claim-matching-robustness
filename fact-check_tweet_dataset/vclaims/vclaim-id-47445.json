Trump claimed in early June that he had entered the bunker to inspect it, but Attorney General William Barr later contradicted the president\u2019s statement, saying that Trump had been taken there in response to the protests, according to USA Today.\n\nThe image being shared appears to show a June 6 tweet, purportedly deleted by Trump, that references his brief time in the bunker.\n\n\u201cFAKE NEWS MEDIA! It is NOT true that I am the only U.S. president to hide from the American people in a bunker,\u201d reads the alleged tweet. \u201cPeople say that even Franklin Roosevelt hid in a bunker during the protest of the Vietnam War! So UNFAIR!!\u201d\n\nFormer President Franklin D. Roosevelt served as president from 1933 to 1945. He died in 1945, years before the Vietnam War even started.\n\n\u201cI am guessing that one of his handlers explained that it would make him look like an idiot,\u201d the caption remarks.

There is no record of him deleting it in ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets on June 6 or any other date. Media outlets likely would have reported on the comment had he tweeted it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time social media users have shared a fake tweet claiming that it was deleted by a politician. Earlier this month, Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was the target of such a hoax that falsely suggested she tweeted that governors should \u201cmaintain restrictions on businesses until after the November Elections.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
