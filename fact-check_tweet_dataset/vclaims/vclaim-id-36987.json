It is included in the Thomas Jefferson Foundation\u2019s list of spurious quotations.\n\nTurning Point will often share historical quotes to lend support to its political outlook. \u201cThomas Jefferson Agreed That Big Gov SUCKS!\u201d reads the caption of the meme. The problem is that some of the quotes it uses are not, in fact, genuine. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, \u2018That Government Is Best Which Governs The Least\u2019?)\n\nThis meme is one such case. While Jefferson was a proponent of limited government \u2013 \u201cI am for a government rigorously frugal & simple,\u201d he wrote in 1799 \u2013 The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Jefferson ever said or wrote the expression shared in the meme. It can\u2019t be found in any of Jefferson\u2019s writings, and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation includes the quote on its list of \u201cspurious quotations.\u201d\n\nA slightly longer version of the quote says, \u201cMy reading of history convinces me that most bad government has grown out of too much government.\u201d It appears to have originated in a series of lectures delivered by politician John Sharp Williams. The speeches were published in 1913 in the form of a book titled \u201cThomas Jefferson: His Permanent Influence on American Institutions.\u201d The book contains the phrase in question, but the lectures were written about Jefferson, not by him.\n\nThe first known attribution in print to Jefferson dates back to 1950, according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. It bears slight resemblance to a phrase Jefferson did once write: \u201cHistory, in general, only informs us what bad government is.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
