Let\u2019s come together to help each other,\u201d reads the complete message, screenshots of which are posted below with the phone numbers blurred.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on Google using the first mobile number and found that the same list was published on a blog in 2017 and on a Facebook page BLOOD DONOR S in 2016. As per the 2016 post, the people on the list are from Andhra Pradesh or Telangana.\n\nUnlike the posts, the viral text includes a false and misleading sentence, \u201cFrom a group of people ready to make plasma donation.\u201d\n\nThe following text was also shared by Facebook page Hyderabad Blood Donors in 2017. The accompanying Telugu text said, \u201cAnyone who wants blood in an emergency should contact the aforementioned numbers\u201d (translated from \u0c05\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c35\u0c38\u0c30 \u0c2a\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c25\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c41\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c30\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c02 \u0c15\u0c3e\u0c35\u0c32\u0c38\u0c3f\u0c28 \u0c35\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c2a\u0c48\u0c28 \u0c2a\u0c47\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c4a\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28 \u0c35\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c28\u0c3f \u0c38\u0c02\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c26\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c1a\u0c02\u0c21\u0c3f). We also found a 2015 post on the Facebook page The New Face of Society which includes phone numbers from the viral message.\n\nAlt News tried to connect with several donors on the list. Most of the numbers were not functioning. However, we managed to connect with one person (identity concealed at request) who confirmed that the viral message is four years old and related to a blood donation drive.\n\nSocial media claims suggesting that the people on the list are donating their blood plasma is yet another piece of misinformation floating in the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak.", "lang": "en"}
