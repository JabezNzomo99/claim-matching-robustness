Raab: Not a billion pounds each day, for sure, which is the price tag.\n\nThis morning, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab claimed that the Bill from Hilary Benn MP and others, intended to rule out a no deal Brexit unless parliament consents, would cost British taxpayers \u00a31 billion a month (we assume Mr Raab misspoke when he said \u00a31 billion \u201ca day\u201d in his Radio 5 Live interview, as that would be very wrong).\n\nIt\u2019s also been reported that the same \u00a31 billion a month claim was made by a Number 10 spokesperson, attributing it to the UK having to pay additional EU budget contributions if our exit from the EU is delayed.\n\nThis is potentially misleading, as it\u2019s based on comparing the cost of any extension specifically to a no deal scenario in which the UK did not pay any of the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d (the financial settlement previously agreed with the EU). But the government\u2019s stated intent, repeated by Mr. Raab in the same interviews, is still to leave with a deal.\n\nMost studies predict that the economic effects of leaving the EU will exceed the benefits of not having to pay the EU membership fee.\n\nThe \u201cdivorce bill\u201d agreed by Theresa May\u2019s government already includes the UK\u2019s normal payments into the EU budget until December 2020. The legislation currently before Parliament itself proposes an extension only until January 2020 (although the EU could propose a different extension, which could itself be rejected by Parliament.)\n\nAs such, any payments into the EU budget following an extension in this period would reduce the final \u201cdivorce bill\u201d paid upon leaving the EU by the same amount. Leaving with a deal in January 2020 wouldn\u2019t cost more in EU budget contributions than leaving with a deal in October 2019 would. This has already happened once: the original settlement was around \u00a339 billion, but this is now down to \u00a333 billion, largely as a result of extending Brexit from March to October this year.\n\nThe government could of course plan to try and renegotiate this financial settlement before October 31, but we aren\u2019t aware of any indication so far that they hope to do this. In his Radio 4 interview, Mr. Raab said that the government had a \u201ctargeted ask\u201d in negotiations, which was removing the Irish backstop.\n\n\u00a31 billion a month is a ballpark figure for our contributions to the EU budget, but it needs context\n\nIf Mr. Raab is comparing the cost of any extension to a no deal exit at the end of October, then his figure of \u00a31 billion for monthly EU contributions is in the right ballpark. However, as BBC Reality Check has pointed out, this doesn\u2019t factor in payments received from the EU, which would reduce the amount by about a quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s also not entirely clear that leaving with no deal would mean we could avoid paying the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d, something which Boris Johnson has said several times would be his plan in a no deal scenario. When we looked at this question earlier this year, we found that under international law it\u2019s not clearly set out that the UK has to pay anything once it has left the EU. However, the EU would be within its rights to take the case to the International Court of Justice on the grounds of the UK\u2019s repeated commitments to pay, and the outcome of such a case would be hard to predict.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily wrong to compare the potential cost of an extension to a no deal exit - but it\u2019s potentially misleading to do so given that in the same interview Mr Raab restated that the government\u2019s plan is to leave with a deal (\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s been very clear, we want a deal\u201d he said on Radio 4). And if you were making such a comparison, you should factor in the fact that no deal exit will itself have costs.", "lang": "en"}
