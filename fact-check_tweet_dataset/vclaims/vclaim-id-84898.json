The current system was created through the 1974 law, originally designed get private-sector input into trade negotiations at the time. The law gives authority to the president to shape trade committees as appropriate, through the U.S. trade representative (USTR) and the commerce secretary.\n\nThe structure is divided into three tiers. In the first tier is the President\u2019s Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, which advises on overall trade policy. The second tier\u2019s committees advise on general policy areas, specifically environment, labor and agriculture. Another 22 committees in Tier 3 are narrowly focused to provide technical advice for trade agreements, and each is focused on a specific industry.\n\nThe negotiations for TPP started before the United States took the lead in 2009, and the 16 industry committees were already in place prior to the Obama administration. (The administration most recently renewed their charters in 2014.) The committees are renewed as long as there is a need for them \u2014 i.e., ongoing negotiations for TPP.\n\nDo the committee members \u201cwhisper in the ear\u201d of negotiators? Warren\u2019s staff said she was referring to the confidentiality of communications between the committee members and trade negotiators. Under the law, the USTR can develop rules for disclosing classified and trade-sensitive information to the advisory committee members, who have security clearance as long as they are on the committee.\n\nThe 85 percent figure comes from a 2014 graphic by The Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog. Wonkblog found that of the 566 people who were on the committee, 480 (85 percent) were from private industry and trade groups (some were nonprofit trade associations). The majority of those members are, indeed, senior-level executives, government-relations representatives or consultants working on behalf of the companies.\n\nSchott said that the industry committees need people who have technical expertise. Tiers 1 and 2 are designed to focus on broader trade issues, and do not get into the same level of detail as Tier 3 committees, he said. Plus, Schott noted, the Tier-1 Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations Members has union representatives.\n\n\u201cIf you count all three tiers together, probably a large number are from industries, manufacturing or service committees because that\u2019s the composition of the third-tier committees,\u201d Schott said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the case in the first and second tier, where there is more broad-based representatives from labor and there is a labor advisory committee.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Advisory Committee is one of the second-tier committees, comprising labor representatives. There also are non-industry representatives on the first-tier committee that provides general guidance on trade policy. But Thea Lee, AFL-CIO deputy chief of staff, said that the system is still numerically dominated by industry representatives. USTR has opened up positions on the industry committees for representatives from labor and consumer groups, but the approval process has been slow, Lee said.\n\nWarren\u2019s criticism of the advisory committees is one that a broad group of labor, environment, consumer and public interest groups have made about the process over the years. But while Warren says the 28 trade advisory committees were \u201cformed\u201d during the TPP drafting process, the committee structure has existed since they were enacted into law in the 1970s.\n\nHer staff says the senator was referring to the renewal and reappointment process, through which the Obama administration shaped the committees, their makeup and access. The committees began giving input on TPP in 2008, before Obama became president. And by law, the committees are renewed as long as there is a need for them \u2014 i.e., ongoing negotiations over TPP. Her use of the word \u201cformed\u201d creates a misleading impression for the average voter.\n\nWarren says the committee members are mostly made of corporation and industry representatives, and that they \u201cwhisper in the ear\u201d of negotiators. She is referring to the meetings during which committee members provide advice and input in confidence, although the committees still file written reports. And it is true that industry representatives make up a large number of the total membership, but it is worth noting that there is a labor committee in the second tier, labor representatives in the first tier and that the industry groups have a narrow focus (to give technical advice).", "lang": "en"}
