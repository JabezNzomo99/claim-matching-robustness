This video is being shared in the context of Corporate Tax reduction by the Modi Government, and is being portrayed as a recent video. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: The video that talks about companies shutting down operations in China is a recent one. Fact: The video in the post is an old one. It was uploaded on the \u2018Arirang News\u2019 YouTube channel in 2015. Also, the news related to 200 US companies looking to move manufacturing base from China to India was published in April-2019 and is neither related to the video in the post nor the corporate tax rate cut. So, old news stories are being shared as the outcome of Corporate Tax reduction by the Modi Government. Hence, the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen searched on Google with the keywords \u2018Companies closing factories in China\u2019, the same video was found in the search results. But, the video was uploaded on YouTube by the \u2018Arirang News\u2019 channel in February-2015. So, the video is not related to any recent event or decision.\n\nWhen searched on Google about the news on 200 US companies shifting from China to India, news articles regarding this issue can be found in the search results. According to an article published by the \u2018Economic Times\u2019 in April-2019, \u2018about 200 American companies are seeking to move their manufacturing base from China to India post the general elections, a top US-based advocacy group has said, observing that there is a fantastic opportunity with firms looking at alternatives to the Communist giant.\u2019 This news is also neither new nor related to the Modi Government\u2019s recent decision to reduce Corporate Tax.\n\nTo sum it up, a 4-year-old news video is being shared as a recent video after the reduction in Corporate Tax.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
