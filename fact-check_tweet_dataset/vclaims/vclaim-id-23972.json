Social media users claim that the students belong to a madrasa in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the students were not shouting Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 but Saabir Sahab Zindabad\u2019. Saabir Paanwala is the principal of the said madrasa.\n\nFacebook user Kajal Yadav posted the viral video on Tuesday which has already been shared more than 1,200 times. In the video, a number of school children are heard shouting slogans in the presence of policemen.\n\nThe caption in Hindi along with the video reads, In Mandsaur, pro-Pakistan slogans given soon after coming out of Anjuman school.\n\nMany on Twitter also shared the video believing it to be true.\n\nWith the help of some keywords, we found media reports related to the incident. The name of the school is Anwarool Uloom, located in Khanpur locality of Mandsaur.\n\nReports say students of this madrasa-cum-English medium school were protesting in support of school principal Saabir Paanwala as he could be sacked by the school committee.\n\nAs per the reports, the children were raising slogans of Saabir Sahab Zindabad\u2019, but the video was made viral with a communal twist.\n\nIndia Today also accessed the video in which the audio was slowed down by police cyber experts. It was clear that the kids were actually raising slogans of Saabir Sahab Zindabad\u2019.\n\nWe also reached out to the madrasa\u2019s principal Saabir Paanwala and assistant principal Saurabh Dubey for clarification. Both denied the claim that students raised Pakistan Zindabad slogans\u2019.\n\nNarendra Solanki, circle superintendent of police, Mandsaur, also told India Today that the claim of students raising pro-Pakistan slogans is false.", "lang": "en"}
