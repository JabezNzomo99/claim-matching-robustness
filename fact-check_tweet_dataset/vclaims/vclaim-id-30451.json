A fact-check reveals that Russian Orthodox believers in Ukraine are breaking with the Moscow-led hierarchy in response to Kirill\u2019s support of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "April 20, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-30451", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-orthodox-church-ukraine/28442600.html", "vclaim": "Patriarch Kirill said he was perplexed by the international community\u2019s silence in the face of \u201coppression\u201d of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe silence of the world community is bewildering,\u201d Kirill told the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s annual Easter party. \u201cOur church is being oppressed, they are trying to deprive it of civil rights, trying to adopt laws that exclude the normal registration of the Orthodox parishes in Ukraine; the forced takeover of the churches is taking place.\u201d\n\nAs head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Kirill has the formal title \u201cPatriarch of Moscow and All Russia.\u201d The Ukrainian Orthodox Church came under Russian Orthodox Church jurisdiction in the 17th century.\n\nHowever, Patriarch Kirill\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea and decision to back armed separatists in eastern Ukraine, as well as his general approval of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s policies, caused a split between the Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox churches.\n\n\u201cAll congregations in Ukraine are equal before the law, and none of them is privileged or subjected to restrictions. According to the law, any religious community has a right to freely choose the center of their subordination, but the laws do not provide a mechanism of how to implement that right,\u201d Archbishop Evstratiy, a spokesman of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, told Polygraph.info.\n\nAccording to Evstratiy, there is legislation pending in Ukraine\u2019s parliament aimed at creating that missing mechanism, \u201cThe proposed law stipulates that every congregation shall decide on the subordination by a majority of votes during a convention,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Evstratiy, the Moscow Patriarchate has lost most of its adherents in Ukraine. \u201cWhen members of a congregation say they would like to leave the Moscow Patriarchate and join the Kyiv Patriarchate instead, Moscow tries to prevent this by all means, including by claiming that the churches are being taken over forcibly, when in reality it was the members of same congregation who did not want to be supervised by Moscow any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe latest annual report by the human rights group Freedom House places Ukraine in the \u201cpartially free\u201d category. It says that religious rights in Ukraine are \u201cgenerally respected,\u201d noting that the conflict in eastern Ukraine \u201chas increased friction between rival branches of the Orthodox Church, and smaller religious groups continue to report some discrimination.\u201d\n\nAccording to Freedom House, most of the incidents in Ukraine involving the suppression of religious rights have taken place in regions controlled by the Russia-backed separatists.\n\n\u201cIn the DNR [Donetsk People's Republic] and LNR [Luhansk People's Republic], separatist forces have reportedly persecuted Protestant and other non\u2013Russian Orthodox denominations, forcing them to flee or operate underground churches,\u201d the report states.\n\nExperts say the current hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church fully backs the Kremlin\u2019s foreign policy, including its policy toward Ukraine.\n\n\u201cKirill is completely misrepresenting the situation\u201d in Ukraine, Paul Goble, a former U.S. government official and an expert on Russia, told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cHis church in Ukraine is working against the Ukrainian state and seeking to disorder Ukrainian society,\u201d Goble said. \u201cThere have been no official reprisals against it, although there have been limited actions by some Ukrainian faithful against Moscow Patriarchate churches and clergy. Kirill views anything but the complete submission of everyone to his and the Kremlin's position as opposition.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
