But he has voted for spending bills that deny such funds.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-06-11T07:00:01.696Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-28829", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/11/did-bernie-sanders-consistently-vote-against-hyde-amendment/?utm_term=.de65c154645d", "vclaim": "But as CNN\u2019s Dana Bash pointed out in an interview with Sanders on June 9, the senator has voted for bills that contain the Hyde Amendment. \u201cWell, look, sometimes, you \u2014 in a large bill, you have to vote for things you don\u2019t like,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cBut I think my record as being literally 100 percent pro-choice is absolutely correct.\u201d\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, named after the late congressman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), is a provision that has been routinely inserted in appropriations bills. Originally, it provided an exception only when a woman\u2019s life is in danger, but during the Clinton administration the exceptions were expanded to include cases of rape and incest. It mainly affects low-income women who rely on Medicaid.\n\nWe count 26 times that Sanders voted for spending bills that contained the amendment, both as a House member and a senator. (As Politico noted, other Democrats running for president also voted for spending bills containing the Hyde Amendment.) We could not find any statement from Sanders stating his opposition to the provision when he voted for a spending bill \u2014 or even when he voted against it.\n\nIndeed, we found evidence that Sanders in 2009 assured constituents that the Hyde Amendment meant there would be no federal funding of abortions as part of the health-care reform being pursued by President Barack Obama. A letter to the editor in the Bennington Banner, posted on Sanders\u2019s Senate website, recounted that in response to a question, Sanders said at a town hall that \u201cconcern that the health care proposals support abortion is ill founded; the Hyde Amendment forbids use of federal funds for abortions.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not an exact quote, and though we found a YouTube clip of the Aug. 15, 2009, town hall, that segment of the session apparently was not recorded. So we can\u2019t be sure he said that, though one would think he would not post it on his website if it was inaccurate. It\u2019s an indication of how politicians such as Sanders might have accepted the status quo while professing to oppose it.\n\nStill, just a month earlier, Sanders helped reject a GOP effort at the committee level to include the Hyde language as part of the emerging health-care legislation. He also voted in December 2009 on the floor against an amendment that would have prohibited the federal funding of abortions in the government\u2019s reformed health-care system.\n\nIndeed, NARAL Pro-Choice America does not score votes for omnibus spending bills as being in support of the Hyde Amendment. Instead, it scores key individual votes, such as two in 2015, when Sanders voted in support of (failed) efforts to strike Hyde language from a health-care bill and a human-trafficking bill.\n\nWe initially wondered if Sanders\u2019s definitive statement that he \u201cconsistently voted against\u201d the Hyde Amendment merited Pinocchios. He certainly has voted for spending bills that contained the amendment and did not make an issue of the Hyde language when he voted against the bills. But he did vote against the amendment every time he was presented with a stand-alone vote and has consistently supported abortion rights. His tweet perhaps should not have been so definitive about his voting record on the Hyde Amendment, and it gave us pause, but we will leave this unrated.
