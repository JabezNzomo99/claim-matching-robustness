Rashida Tlaib filed a lawsuit to ban American flags from her state\u2019s schools.\n\nThere is no record of such a lawsuit. The claim originated on a satirical website.\n\nTlaib was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2018, becoming one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, according to BBC News. She is currently running for reelection in Michigan\u2019s 13th congressional district. (RELATED: Does The \u2018Squad\u2019 Want The Bible To Be Deemed Hate Speech?)\n\nThe article, titled \u201cTlaib Files Lawsuit to Ban the American Flag in Schools,\u201d was published June 3 on the website GNF News. It describes the arguments for banning the American flag from Michigan classrooms included in the alleged lawsuit that Tlaib filed with Michigan\u2019s Ninth Circuit Court.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to end the discriminatory practice of having American flags in the classroom,\u201d the supposed lawsuit states. \u201cThere are many children who are either not American or don\u2019t identify as Americans in our public schools. They have a right to attend a flag-free classroom.\u201d\n\nHowever, that lawsuit doesn\u2019t appear to exist. It does not appear in the archive of Michigan court cases maintained by the state\u2019s government. An internet search by the Daily Caller also found no credible report of Tlaib ever filing a lawsuit to that effect.\n\nThe article seems to lift nearly word-for-word from an article published on We Are Allod, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d While We Are Allod clearly disclaims the satirical nature of the article, GNF News fails to include such a warning, leading some social media users to believe it is factual.", "lang": "en"}
