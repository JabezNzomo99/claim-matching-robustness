The image, originally posted on the social media website Parler, alleges the president recently donated his $400,000 salary for the rebuilding of military cemeteries.\n\nYet, while the president has contributed his salary to various government initiatives, including some military-related projects, none of these donations paid for cemetery repairs. He has never given a single agency his entire yearly salary, per FactCheck.org.

The Department of the Interior announced in a July 2017 statement that it would fund restoration projects at Maryland\u2019s Antietam National Battlefield. Those funds, however, did not go toward the Antietam National Cemetery, according to a spokesperson from the Interior Department.\n\n\u201cThe funds were used to rebuild the historic fence line important to the battle and rehabilitate the exterior of the historic Newcomer House,\u201d the spokesperson told the Daily Caller in an email. \u201cNone of the money was used in the cemetery.\u201d\n\nAccording to White House announcements, his other 2017 quarterly salary donations went to the Department of Education for a student science camp, the Department of Health and Human Services for the opioid crisis and Department of Transportation for infrastructure, respectively.\n\nIn 2018, Trump donated his first-quarter salary to the Department of Veteran Affairs for caregiving programs, according to The Hill. The Small Business Administration and National Institutes of Health were the recipients of his second- and third-quarter salaries, USA Today reported. His fourth-quarter salary went to the Department of Homeland Security that year.\n\nThe first three quarterly paychecks of 2019 have gone to the Department of Agriculture, the Office of the Surgeon General and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, according to media reports. The destination of his 2019 fourth-quarter salary has not been announced at the time of publication.", "lang": "en"}
