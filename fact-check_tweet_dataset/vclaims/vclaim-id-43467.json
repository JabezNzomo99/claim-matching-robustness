Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has come under fire for furloughing workers even after it received $25 million in federal aid as part of a $2 trillion stimulus package to help dull the economic pain caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSome Republicans were already critical of funneling money to the Kennedy Center, while Democrats defended the bailout, saying it employs nearly 3,000 people.\n\nBut on Facebook, a widely shared post suggests House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s motivations for supporting the line item were personal.\n\n\"So Nancy\u2019s daughter is on the board of the Kennedy Center,\" the March 30 post says, \"so that\u2019s why it was so important to send them all that money.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe Kennedy Center didn\u2019t respond to PolitiFact\u2019s email asking about the Facebook post. But Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, told us the post isn\u2019t true.\n\nNone of Pelosi\u2019s children appear on the center\u2019s list of board of trustee officers, members appointed by the president, honorary trustees or emeritus trustees.\n\nNancy Pelosi has five children: four daughters \u2014 Nancy Corinne Prowda, Christine Pelosi, Jacqueline Kenneally and Alexandra Pelosi \u2014 and one son, Paul Pelosi.\n\nNancy Pelosi is an ex officio member, designated by an act of Congress, according to the Kennedy Center\u2019s website. So are Trump administration officials such as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Republican lawmakers like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader of the House; and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. HuffPost reported the original budget request for the Kennedy Center came from a Kennedy Center staffer who was formerly a top aide to Blunt.\n\nIn an email to the Daily Caller, a spokeswoman for the Kennedy Center said that none of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s children are affiliated with the institution, according to the outlet.", "lang": "en"}
