However, we found that the image is from 2016 when a Reuters photographer had captured a demonstrator during a protest in Chile\u2019s Santiago. You can view the archived version here. The claim long with the image reads: \u201cI am not a brainless stupid tiktoker muslim girl. I am an arabian muslim girl. I will fight for my Masjid-ul-Aqsa until the last breath of my life. Stop me if you can!\"-A brave Palestinian sister May Allah protect our Palestinians brothers & sisters... Ameen Ya Rabb (sic)\u201d The image shared by Facebook user \u2018USA Muslims\u2019 had garnered over 800 shares at the time of publishing the article. You can view the archived version here.

The organisation had credited the image to Reuters photographer Carlos Vera. Consequently, we searched on Reuters image archives and found that the image was captured in 2016. The caption along with the image read: \u201cA demonstrator looks at a riot policeman during a protest marking the country's 1973 military coup in Santiago, Chile, 11 September 2016. Picture taken 11 September 2016.\u201d A Reuters photographer had captured the image in 2016. We also found that CNN had published an article on the \u2018defiant stare\u2019 of the girl in September 2016. The article was titled as: \u2018Chile demonstrator's defiant stare goes viral\u2019. The protests in Santiago took place to mark 43 years since the bloody military coup. On 11 September 1973, Chile\u2019s armed forces had attacked Chile\u2019s democratic government which resulted in President Salvador being overthrown and killed. As a result of the military coup, Augusto Pinochet, commander in chief of the armed forces, became Chile\u2019s dictator. Evidently, an old image is being falsely shared to claim that it shows a Palestinian woman fighting for Al-Aqsa mosque.", "lang": "en"}
