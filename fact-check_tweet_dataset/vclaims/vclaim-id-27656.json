Zamfara Governor\u2019s Convoy Not Attacked!", "subtitle": "", "author": "dubawa.org", "date": "2019-09-10T11:29:34+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-27656", "url": "https://dubawa.org/false-zamfara-governors-convoy-not-attacked/", "vclaim": "CLAIM: Media publications say Zamfara State Governor, Matawelle\u2019s convoy was attacked, leaving two dead policemen and many injured.\n\nFALSE: Gov. Matawalle\u2019s convoy was not attacked. However, two policemen did die in a car accident; but not by bandits as reports allege.\n\nThe news regarding the alleged attack on Matawalle arrived in the media on Friday, 30th of August. Circulated by Daily Post and some blogs like legit.ng, arewa.ng; who alleged that the Zamfara state governor\u2019s convoy was attacked by thugs suspected to belong to an unnamed political party.\n\nApparently, this took place very close to Funtua in Katsina State; a boundary town with Zamfara state. According to reports, two policemen were killed in the attack while many were left with varying degrees of injury.\n\nAdditionally, it was reported that Gov. Bello Matawalle is currently in a running battle with the preceding administration. This allegedly led to the governor setting up a committee headed by the immediate past deputy governor, Mallam Ibrahim Wakalla to investigate the administration of quondam Gov. Yari.\n\nThe allegations above were still unverified at the time; as efforts to reach the Governor were futile. This was the disclaimer given by Daily Post in their publication; and rightly so\u2026 owing to the fact that Dr Matawalle\u2019s twitter handle completely nullifies the claims.\n\nOn Sat, Aug 31, Dr Bello Matawalle\u2019s responded to this post on his twitter handle. He referred to the claims as fakenews.\n\n\u201cThis is fake news, my convoy wasn\u2019t attacked, Two policemen were left behind to oversee the repairs of a broken vehicle from our convoy in Zaria, on their way back to Gusau they had an accident which claimed the lives of Aminu Usman and Nura Mohammed, May their soul Rest In Peace\u201d\n\nHe also said that the former governor doesn\u2019t have a hand in the accident, neither do thugs or bandits. Furthermore, he cautioned the media platform against the spread of this story as it only soils their reputation.\n\nGov. Matawalle\u2019s convoy was not attacked. However, two policemen did die in a car accident; but not by bandits as reports allege.\n\nEbere Agozie is a Senior Correspondent with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) with a staff strength of about 880, Joined in 2014 as a correspondent.
