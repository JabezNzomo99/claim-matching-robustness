But the number of primary teachers has risen while the number of secondary teachers is down. We\u2019ve asked the Department for Education if Mrs May was referring to the same time frame.\n\nThere was one teacher for every 17.4 pupils across England in 2015. That\u2019s up from 17.2 between 2011 and 2013.\n\nThat\u2019s counting both qualified and unqualified teachers, although the trend is broadly the same if you just look at qualified teachers.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015 the pupil-teacher ratio in all state nursery and primary schools stayed the same at 20.5. In state secondary schools it went from 14.9 to 15.3. Again, this is looking across all teachers whether qualified or not.\n\nThe Department for Education pointed us to initial figures suggesting that around 4,800 (or 18%) of the 26,700 new entrants to postgraduate teacher training had a first class degree in 2016/17.\n\nThese figures are still to be finalised and might change, but so far that\u2019s the same proportion of postgraduate trainees with a first class degree as last year, although the number is slightly down. Last year there were 5,000 entrants with a first class degree.\n\nWe can\u2019t directly compare to the years before 2015/16 because the Department for Education only counted teacher training entrants via the Teach First programme from 2015/16 onwards. But we can say that between 2012/13 and 2014/15 the proportion increased from 14% to 17%.\n\nThe National Audit Office has said that \u201cdegree class is a reasonable indicator of subject knowledge but a less clear predictor of other aspects of teacher quality.\u201d It also points out that many secondary subjects don\u2019t have enough trainees to fill all the training places. \u201c14 out of 17 secondary subjects had unfilled training places, compared with 2 subjects with unfilled places in 2010/11\u201d.\n\nNot all teachers go into teacher training having already qualified in something else. Around one in six trainee teachers are undergraduates.", "lang": "en"}
