Politico reported that on April 4 she privately told the leaders that Vermont shared blame for the guns being used in crimes in New York. Her critics responded quickly, noting Vermont is the source of a small number of crime guns found in New York. (Her campaign said it could not confirm her statement.)\n\nLaw enforcement agencies tie the movement of guns into New York and New Jersey to the \u201cIron Pipeline,\u201d which is Interstate 95 and connector highways. The idea is that guns are being trafficked from southern states with less restrictive gun laws, generally via cars, and then are used in crime in northern states that have stricter gun laws. (Related: We have fact-checked whether states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest deaths, which found that despite Vermont\u2019s relatively lax gun laws, it had the second lowest death rate from guns when suicides are excluded.)\n\nClinton\u2019s answer was in response to Sanders\u2019s claim about Vermont being a small, rural state with no gun laws, the campaign said. The campaign said it chose to look at the per capita rate because it shows that despite the small population in Vermont, the pro-gun laws and the state\u2019s background check system are \u201cso bad that more guns per people living there are ending up in crime scenes in New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many people live there. The issue is, how many gun dealers are there that are contributing to violence in New York,\u201d said John Roman, senior fellow in the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Roman, who has worked with New York officials over gun violence and gun laws, said concerns over guns trafficked from Vermont were not brought up in those discussions over many years.\n\n\u201cHere, the question is: if we want to cut off the supply line of guns into New York, what supply line is largest? That would not be Vermont,\u201d McCoy said. For gun trafficking, it is \u201cIron Pipeline from the Southern states, garden hose from Vermont. It would be great to cut off both of them, but given the choice I would go with the pipeline.\u201d\n\nThe campaign pointed to reports of gun trafficking problems in Vermont. Vermont Public Radio interviewed the ATF agent in charge of Vermont, and reported the state is \u201ca fertile market, but it\u2019s also an easy place to pick up a weapon. \u2026 The guns are frequently traded directly for drugs, court records show, and often end up in metropolitan areas like Springfield, Mass., Boston, or New York City.\u201d Other news coverage and reports by gun-control groups cited per capita rates, and noted other issues with crime that contribute to the flow of guns out of the state. For one, the heroin epidemic in Vermont has contributed to gun trafficking, according to In These Times.\n\nThe per capita calculation is skewed by Vermont\u2019s small population (55 guns out of 626,562 people, or 8.78 guns per 100,000 people). When it comes to gun trafficking between states, the raw numbers indicate the actual volume of guns flowing out of a state, and the prevalence of dealers who may be selling guns that are tied to crime. If you take out the 55 Vermont-originated guns from all crime guns that came from outside of New York, the number of crime guns in 2014 would decrease to 2,556 from 2,611. That\u2019s how much impact the flow of crime guns from Vermont has on the volume of crime guns in New York.", "lang": "en"}
