Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: The Hospital shown in the video is RK Khan hospital in Durban, South Africa. During the year 2019, a troop of monkeys inhabited this hospital and started Stealing the food from sick patients. Information about this incident was found in the articles published by the \u2018DailyMail\u2019 and \u2018Daily Express\u2019 news websites. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we did a reverse image search of the screenshots in the posted video, we found a similar video in an article published by \u2018Daily Mail\u2019 news website in March 2019. In this article, it was mentioned that an aggressive troop of monkeys were terrorising the patients inside RK Khan Hospital in Durban, South Africa. Article with similar content showing the same video was found in the \u2018Daily Express\u2019 news website. It could be read here.\n\nA troop of monkeys inhabited a hospital in Durban for more than 3 months during the year 2019. Climbing through the open doors and Stealing the food from sick patients, these monkeys forced the patients to cover themselves with the bed covers. Hospital administration set up a task force to deal with these monkeys after the situation in the hospital came to limelight. Also, the Health Minister of the South African Government has directed to halt any such invasions from animals.\n\nTo sum it up, the situation of a hospital in South Africa during 2019 is falsely portrayed as the condition of a hospital treating COVID-19 patients in India.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
