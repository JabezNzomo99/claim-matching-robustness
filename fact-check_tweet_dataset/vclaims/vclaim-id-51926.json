No ban on the sale of alcohol and tobacco has been instituted in Memphis.\n\nAlleged news articles about bans on the sale of alcohol and other products have been circulating amid state and local governments issuing orders to close nonessential businesses in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nThis particular post claims Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland banned the sale of alcohol and tobacco starting on March 31 \u201cdue to Memphis TN residents not following covid 19 (sic) orders.\u201d However, the article, which masquerades as a legitimate news story, actually comes from Channel22news.com, a website that allows users to create their own articles for pranks.\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any mention of Strickland banning the sale of alcohol or tobacco on the city\u2019s official website. Dan Springer, the media affairs deputy director for Strickland\u2019s office, confirmed in an email to the Caller that the claim \u201cis not true.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Gov. Bill Lee issued an executive order in late March loosening alcohol regulations to allow qualifying Tennessee restaurants and bars to sell alcohol in closed containers through take-out and delivery. Restaurants and bars are considered essential businesses and can only \u201coffer drive-through, pickup, carry-out, or delivery service,\u201d according to the executive order.\n\nSome establishments that sell tobacco products, such as gas stations and food and drug stores, are also listed as essential businesses.
