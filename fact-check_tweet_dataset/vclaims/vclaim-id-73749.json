{"title": "Did Kamala Harris Say Joe Biden Is 'Trash to Me'?", "subtitle": "A quote lifted from a blog post about Harris and Biden was misattributed to Harris.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-08-24T10:43:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-73749", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/harris-biden-blog-post/", "vclaim": "In late August 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a meme circulating on Facebook that contained a quote attributed to U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, in which she referred to her running mate, Joe Biden, as \u201ctrash\u201d:\n\nWe found no evidence Harris made this comment about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. In fact, the quote seems to have originated with a June 2019 post on a news and entertainment blog called Flim Flam \u2014 but the quote wasn\u2019t attributed to Harris on that blog. Instead, it was simply commentary by the blog writer.\n\nHere\u2019s the quote from the blog, in context:\n\nI don\u2019t like Joe Biden and do not like his history with certain people or who he\u2019s aligned with, he\u2019s trash to me. However, with that being said, Biden may be someone I don\u2019t like but he does make a legitimate point when dealing with horrible people. Kamala may be taking shots for political gain and personal ones at that but what happens if she\u2019s president?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time an inflammatory quote has been falsely attributed to Harris. In early August 2020, for example, a statement attributed to Harris saying she would be \u201ccoming for\u201d supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump circulated widely on social media. It was a fake quote that originated on a website labeled \u201csatire.\u201d\n\nAlthough Harris and Biden did clash during Democratic primary debates, when Harris was campaigning to be the party\u2019s nominee, Harris never made the comment calling Biden \u201ctrash.\u201d Instead, it was taken out of context from a blog post written by someone else and attributed to her.", "lang": "en"}
