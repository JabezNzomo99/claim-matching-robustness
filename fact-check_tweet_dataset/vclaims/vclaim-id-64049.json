Cory Booker, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who was recently named Biden\u2019s 2020 running mate. In the photos, none of them are wearing masks or practicing social distancing, nor does the crowd behind them appear to be doing so.\n\n\u201cLook at these Photos of Biden making the announcement of his Running Mate,\u201d reads text in the post. \u201cAll these Democrats gathering, No Masks, No Social Distancing. It\u2019s obvious Democrats don\u2019t practice what they\u2019re feeding the rest of the American People.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Michigan Gov Gretchen Whitmer Violating Social Distancing Rules For A Beer Tasting?)\n\nHowever, these pictures were not taken recently. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller News Foundation discovered they come from a March 9 rally in Detroit, Michigan, months before Biden announced Harris as his pick for vice president. Photos of the rally from Getty Images show the politicians wearing the same clothes as those in the collage of images being shared.\n\nThe Getty Images caption for a photo of Biden clasping hands with Whitmer and Booker reads, \u201cSen. Kamala Harris (L) (D-CA), Sen. Cory Booker (R)(D-NJ), and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer join Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden on stage at a campaign rally at Renaissance High School on March 09, 2020 in Detroit, Michigan.\u201d\n\nThe rally occurred two days before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic and four days before President Donald Trump declared it a national emergency. The CDC didn\u2019t recommend people wear face coverings in public settings until early April, weeks after the rally had taken place.\n\nMichigan announced on March 10 that it had confirmed its first presumptive coronavirus cases.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
