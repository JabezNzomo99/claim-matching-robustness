The video is being shared on social media with a caption purportedly claiming that the incident took place after the recent hike in petrol and diesel prices.\n\nBOOM had debunked the same video in 2018 and found that the incident took place at Khuntia petrol pump in Puri, Odisha on September 28, 2018.\n\nThere has been a continuous surge in fuel prices (since June 7) with petrol prices being hiked by Rs 0.25 per litre and diesel prices by Rs 0.21 per litre on June 27.\n\nThe rates of petrol and diesel prices differ from one state to another based on the incidence of Value Added Tax (VAT).
