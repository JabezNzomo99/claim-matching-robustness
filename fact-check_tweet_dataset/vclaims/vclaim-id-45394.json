This video was taken at Danger Danger bar in Wellington as the clock struck midnight on June 9, 2020, ending the country\u2019s social distancing enforcement.\n\nMatt McLaughlin, the owner of Danger Danger, told Australia\u2019s Stuff news outlet the following:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great video of midnight hitting and everyone jumping off their chairs and jumping on the dance floor. It\u2019s quite hard case\u2026 People want to socialise. They\u2019ve been cooped up for three months, and they want to get out and see their friends.\u201d\n\nAccording to the BBC, the above-displayed video captured the moment that New Zealand officially moved to a \u201clevel one\u201d on their four-tier alert system, meaning that all social distancing guidelines put in place during the pandemic were removed. There are now no limits on public gatherings (which means sports, concerts, and other large public gatherings can take place) and effectively no restrictions on business operations.\n\nBut one COVID-19 policy remains: New Zealand\u2019s borders will remain closed to foreigners for the time being.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was not at the Danger Danger bar the when the video was taken, she did tell reporters that she did a \u201clittle dance\u201d when she learned that New Zealand no longer had any active cases of COVID-19:\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re in a safer, stronger position, there\u2019s still no easy path back to pre-Covid life, but the determination and focus we have had on our health response will now be vested in our economic rebuild \u2026 While the job is not done, there is no denying this is a milestone. So can I finish with a very simple, \u2018Thank you, New Zealand\u2019.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
