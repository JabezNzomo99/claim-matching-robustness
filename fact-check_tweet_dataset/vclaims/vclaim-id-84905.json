You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Florida. Palm Beach is a very expensive place. There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions. So I sold it. So I bought it for 40, I sold it for 100 to a Russian. That was a number of years ago. I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, okay?\u201d\n\nAt another point in the news conference, he acknowledged \u201cnumerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.\u201d He did not provide reasons.\n\nThe problem with this account is that it is contradicted by other evidence suggesting the Trump Organization has long been interested in business in Russia \u2014 evidence collected by our colleagues Tom Hamburger, Rosalind S. Helderman and Michael Birnbaum for a lengthy article that was published in June.\n\nHere\u2019s what Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, told our colleagues in May: \u201cI can tell you, as a company, we\u2019re always looking at new developments. No question about it. We\u2019re always looking to expand and do projects all over the world. I have no doubt, as a company, I know we\u2019ve looked at deals in Russia. And many of the former Russian Republics.\u201d\n\nThe Palm Beach sale was documented in the Post article, and Trump\u2019s numbers are close. Trump sold a mansion in 2008 for $95 million to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev, according to property records. Trump had purchased the mansion at a bankruptcy auction less than four years earlier for $41.4 million, records show.\n\nBut there is other evidence that shows a continuing interest in doing deals not only with Russian real estate buyers, but deals in Russia. \u201cRussia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment,\u201d Trump said in a 2007 deposition. \u201cWe will be in Moscow at some point,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is some evidence that Trump\u2019s interest in doing business in Russia is unrequited. In 1987, he went to Moscow to find a site for luxury hotel; no deal emerged. In 1996, he sought to build a condominium complex in Russia; that also did not succeed. In 2005, Trump signed a one-year deal with a New York development company to explore a Trump Tower in Moscow, but the effort fizzled.\n\nTrump Jr. noted that he traveled to Russia six times in 18 months, and \u201cseveral buyers have been attracted to our projects there and everything associated therewith.\u201d But he added: \u201cAs much as we want to take our business over there, Russia is just a different world\u2026. It is a question of who knows who, whose brother is paying off who\u2026. It really is a scary place.\u201d\n\nThe Post report also said that the Trump Organization had partnered with Aras Agalarov, the so-called \u201cTrump of Russia,\u201d on a project in Moscow in 2013 that didn\u2019t come to fruition. \u201cThe Trump Tower deal never moved past preliminary discussions,\u201d The Post said. \u201cBut Agalarov said the family is interested in a possible future venture.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks are artfully deceiving. He says he had nothing to do with Russia, pointing only to a Florida real estate sale. It may be possible that he has no current investments in Russia, but not for lack of trying.\n\nThe evidence is clear, from his own words and those of his associates, that he has been eager to business in Russia. One of his sons traveled six times in 18 months trying to do deals \u2014 and said \u201cRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\u201d The Trump Organization\u2019s general counsel also confirmed that the company has looked at deals in Russia.\n\nWithout access to Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2014 which he has refused to disclose \u2014 it may be impossible to tell whether he currently has Russian assets. But he shouldn\u2019t be so quick to suggest he has never had an interest into doing business in Russia.", "lang": "en"}
