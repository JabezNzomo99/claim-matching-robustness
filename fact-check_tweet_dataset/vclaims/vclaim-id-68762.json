Leah Vukmir. The suburban Milwaukee Republican is running in the 2018 race for the seat held by first-term U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat.\n\nVukmir addressed the issue during an Oct. 12, 2017 interview with conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Touting a bill pending in the Legislature that is aimed at offenders who are on supervision, Vukmir stated:\n\n\"In 2016, there were 5,570 people who committed crimes on probation and they were not revoked.\"\n\nProbation is often used as a blanket term that also includes parole and extended supervision.\n\nTaking that into account, Vukmir is partially on target:\n\nBut the number is an estimate, not an actual count.\n\nAnd the estimate refers to people on probation who have only been charged with another crime -- not convicted, as she suggested.\n\nUnder current law, if people are suspected of violating a condition of supervision, a state probation-parole agent has discretion on whether to recommend the supervision be revoked. If revocation is recommended and a state administrative law judge agrees, the person goes to prison.\n\nUnder the plan advanced by Republican lawmakers, if the person on supervision is charged with a new crime, the state would require probation-parole agents to recommend revocation.\n\nThe state public defender\u2019s office has raised concerns, saying the bill would remove the ability of probation-parole agents to review cases based on individual circumstances.\n\nThere is also concern about a change in the burden of proof: A person on supervision charged with a new crime could be sent to prison based on probable cause -- the standard for charging a crime -- rather than based on guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for a criminal conviction.\n\nAs for the number part of Vukmir\u2019s claim, it comes from a memo on the bill from the state Department of Corrections.\n\nThe department estimates that in fiscal year 2016, which ran from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016, there were 5,570 people on supervision who were charged with a new crime but were not revoked.\n\nThe department said it made the estimate based on data from the Circuit Court Access Program (CCAP) on the number of people on supervision who were charged with a new crime during that one-year period.\n\nThe memo said the department also assumes that if it had recommended revocation in those 5,570 cases, revocation would be approved for half of them, and the cost to the state prison system would be about $149 million per year.\n\nVukmir says that in 2016, there were 5,570 people in Wisconsin \"who committed crimes on probation and they were not revoked.\"\n\nVukmir\u2019s probation reference appeared to include people who are on other forms of community supervision -- parole and extended supervision. Her claim is partially on target, but goes too far.\n\nThe 5,570 figure is a state Department of Corrections estimate, not an actual count. And, importantly, it is for the number of people charged with a crime, not convicted.", "lang": "en"}
