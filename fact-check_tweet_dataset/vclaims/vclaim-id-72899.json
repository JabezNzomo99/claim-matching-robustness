The claim is false; it is a video from October 2018 when some politicians were caught laughing at the funeral of an Indian politician ND Tiwari.\n\nThe 16-second clip was viewed nearly 10,000 times in four hours after being posted to Facebook here on February 20, 2019.\n\nThe post has a caption in Hindi that translates as: \u201cLook at Yogi Adityanath crying and wailing in front of a martyr\u2019s dead body\u201d.\n\nThe caption has been used sarcastically as Yogi Adityanath, who is the chief minister of a north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh on right side is seen smiling and joking with other politicians.\n\nThere are other online posts containing the same footage and a slightly different caption that have been shared, for example here on Facebook.\n\nThat caption translates in English to: \u201cIt is pitiable that a funeral service has become a joke and a photo opportunity for them. This is how they respect and honour the Army martyrs\u201d.\n\nA reverse image search traces the footage to October 2018 from the funeral of Tiwari. Here is an article about him in The Indian Express after he died of a stroke.\n\nThe laughing incident happened at Tiwari\u2019s funeral, and made national headlines.\n\nThe footage of the politicians laughing was used by Indian media in their news reports, for example here by ABP news on its official YouTube channel. The original clip appears from 0:09 seconds to 00:24 seconds.\n\n\n\nThe incident was also reported in other mainstream media, for example here on news 18 and here on Deccan Herald.\n\nThe politicians identified in the clip are Bharatiya Janata Party members.\n\nOn the top left is Mohsin Raza and on top right is Ashutosh Tandon, they both are cabinet ministers in BJP\u2019s government in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nOn bottom left is Lalji Tandon, the governor of Bihar, an eastern state in India.\n\nOn bottom right is Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of the ruling BJP government in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIndian media often use the word \u2018martyr\u2019 for soldiers killed in action. They do not for politicians who die of natural causes.\n\nFor example, this Times of India news report described the Indian soldiers killed in a February 14, 2019, suicide bomb attack in Indian-administered Kashmir as \u2018martyrs\u2019.\n\nThe Times of India did use that term in its report on Tiwari's death.\n\nAFP identified 26 posts that used the video in a misleading context on Facebook and Twitter on February 19 and 20, as India mourned the loss of the soldiers killed in the Kashmir suicide bomb attack.\n\nHere is an AFP report on the attack.", "lang": "en"}
