However, using the proper data table, Cruz is actually incorrect, so we have changed the rating to Mostly False. The original article is archived .\n\nDuring a town hall event at New England College in Henniker, N.H., Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz faced a questioner who asked what he would do for \"struggling minorities.\"\n\nCruz said the key is economic growth, underpinned by a vigorous free-enterprise system. He suggested that his father -- who worked as a dishwasher shortly after emigrating from Cuba to the United States -- would have lost his job if politicians at the time had raised the minimum wage as high as today\u2019s Democrats would like.\n\nCruz pointed to the Reagan years as a golden age for African-American economic advancement.\n\n\"During eight years under Ronald Reagan,\" Cruz said, \"African-American median income rose by about $5,000. That is real and meaningful transformation.\"\n\nWe should note that Cruz was describing the Reagan years as a time of economic growth, not crediting Reagan for a specific policy. So we\u2019ll simply look to see how wages performed.\n\nWe turned to median income data collected annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. All figures below have been adjusted for inflation.\n\nSo Cruz is wrong -- the gain in median income for African-Americans under Reagan was a little over $2,000, not $5,000, and the increase was smaller on both a dollar basis and a percentage basis than the increase for whites.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Reagan wasn\u2019t the best president for African-American median income in recent history. That crown goes to Bill Clinton -- unlike Reagan, a Democratic president.\n\nBetween 1992 and 2000, black incomes rose from $31,018 to $40,783 -- a gain of $9,765 and a striking 31 percent increase.\n\nCruz said that \"during eight years under Ronald Reagan, African-American median income rose by about $5,000.\"\n\nThe actual increase was a little over $2,000, and the increase was significantly larger under a subsequent Democratic president, Bill Clinton. We rate Cruz\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
