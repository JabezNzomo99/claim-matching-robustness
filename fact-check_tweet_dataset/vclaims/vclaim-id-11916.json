For all people across England and Wales the average age of death was 76 for men and 81 for women.\n\nMen made up the majority of the people who were homeless who died in 2017\u201484%.\n\nA third of deaths were due to drug poisoning, up from 26% in 2013, suicide accounted for 13% of deaths and liver disease for 9%.\n\nThe ONS said that \u201cOur findings show a pattern of deaths among homeless people that is strikingly different from the general population\u2026 More than half were related to drug poisoning, suicide, or alcohol, causes that made up only 3% of overall deaths last year.\u201d\n\nHow reliable are these figures?\n\nThere are different definitions of homelessness, and in this case the ONS refers to \u201cmainly people sleeping rough, or using emergency accommodation such as homeless shelters and direct access hostels, at or around the time of death.\u201d\n\nBecause this definition differs from the one used to measure the total number of \u201chomeless\u201d people and from the number of those people who are \u201crough sleeping\u201d, the ONS says it was unable to calculate a death rate for homeless people.\n\nTo calculate their estimate, the ONS combined a number of things. It looked at the number of homeless people who could be identified as homeless by details in their death records\u2014for example it said they had \u201cno fixed abode\u201d. It also combined this with an estimate of how many people were homeless but couldn\u2019t be identified from their death records.\n\nThe figures also show the number of deaths registered each year, rather than deaths occurring each year. Because of the time it takes for an inquest to be completed\u2014which happens in around 12% of cases when a person who is homeless dies\u2014not all deaths will be recorded in the same year as they happened. This also means that not all deaths in 2017 will have been recorded yet.", "lang": "en"}
