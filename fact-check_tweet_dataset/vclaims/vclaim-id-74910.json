I don\u2019t think that America will again have a leader like him.\"\n\nBut neither the text contained in the body of the article, nor a video embedded in the post, supports the emphatic headline.\n\nThe body of the article is entirely unrelated to politics. It tells an anecdote of Reeves' experience on set during the shooting of the 1994 action film Speed, co-starring Sandra Bullock.\n\nThe video at the end of the post shows an interview Reeves did with a journalist in Uruguay, in which he discussed his early career and current film projects.\n\nNeither the text nor the video mentions politics, much less the actor's views on Trump.\n\nIn fact, the only instance we found of Reeves discussing Trump publicly is when he appeared to criticize the president\u2019s travel ban during a January 2017 question-and-answer with journalists at a red carpet event.\n\nReeves told a journalist he believed the travel ban was \"just terrible,\" according to a Jan. 31, 2017, Associated Press article.\n\nThe only other references we found to Reeves' putative support for Trump were from other dubious websites that repeated the same baseless quote.\n\nReeves' publicist confirmed the quote is fake.\n\n\"It is completely false,\" said Cheryl Maisel, of talent agency PMK-BNC. \"He never made those comments nor did he ever do that interview. All manufactured.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Reeves has been the subject of a fake quote. We previously checked a lengthy cultural critique misattributed to Reeves, which we rated Pants on Fire.\n\nBloggers said Reeves described Trump as the symbol of success and a role model for young Americans.\n\nWe found no evidence he actually said these words.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
