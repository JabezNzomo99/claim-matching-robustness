Just a couple of days ago on Feb 14, BJP\u2019s ideological brother Bajrang Dal thrashed couples in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, who were out celebrating Valentine\u2019s day. A video of same can be seen below:\n\nThe Bajrang Dal attack on couples on Valentine\u2019s day is nothing new. In fact, many senior leaders of BJP, VHP, Bajrang Dal and RSS have time and again voiced their opposition to Valentine\u2019s day by terming it as \u2018western culture\u2019 which degrades \u2018Indian culture\u2019. In fact, as an antidote to this invasion of \u2018western culture\u2019, many right wing leaders have often suggested that Feb 14 be celebrated as \u2018Matru-Pitru divas\u2019 instead, a day when one worships their parents. This year, one collector in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, issued a notice asking people to do so.\n\nHowever, this rather cute celebration at a BJP office, even if it is not Valentine\u2019s day celebration as claimed and just a get-together, hopefully, will be an inspiration for the right wing to let go off the hooliganism in the name of Indian culture. Make love, not war.", "lang": "en"}
