If no one among 8 diretso will win the election she will step down as vice president. Do you think she will fulfill her promise?\"\n\nVarious groups and pages on the social network, particularly those expressing support for President Rodrigo Duterte and his allies, have called on Robredo to fulfill the \u201cpromise\u201d and resign. One of the most shared posts can be found in \"Atty Glenn Chong Supporters Group\". It had 3,000 shares, 892 reactions, and 330 comments as of writing.\n\nThe claim seems to have originated from an article published by The Adobo Chronicles on May 7, 2019. Since then, the story had been shared by 44 Facebook groups and pages and had garnered 6,945 total interactions from 1,546,053 combined followers, according to CrowdTangle.\n\nRobredo actively endorsed members of the Otso Diretso slate during the campaign period. She has expressed support for the team both on social media and on the ground up until the elections results started to come out.

As of writing, 96.3% of total votes have already been transmitted.
