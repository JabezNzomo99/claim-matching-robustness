The clip of the woman being slapped is played throughout the length of the show. At 3:14 minutes, the cop can also be heard making statements, which India Today transcribed as \u2013 \u201cI will do everything. Now you are in a fix. Now you can\u2019t escape.\u201d\n\nIndia Today had also published an article on the issue.\n\nWhat is the truth about the clip?\n\nWe ran the video via InVid software to break it into multiple frames. Upon reverse searching the images on Google, with the keyword \u2018woman slapped by cop Pakistan\u2019, we landed on media reports from 2015. According to an October 29 article in The Express Tribune, a woman allegedly caught stealing valuables from a shopping centre in Karachi was beaten by a man under the garb of a police uniform. The incident took place in Gulf Shopping Mall located in Clifton, and the man slapping the woman was arrested by cops.\n\nAnother report on Pakistani website The News also said that \u201ca man dressed in a police uniform\u2019s shirt in the video was remanded to police officials by the judicial magistrate.\u201d\n\nMedia organisation Samaa, however, reported the incident differently. While the claim of the woman allegedly being a shoplifter was identical, Samaa reported that the man slapping her was a \u2018volunteer cop\u2019. He thrashed the woman to extort a confession out of her.\n\nIf one carefully watches the video, the man can be heard saying \u2013 \u201cTu kaise nahi manegi. Vo sab maani hai. Sab baramad karaya hai (How will you not confess? They all confessed. We recovered everything.)\u201d\n\nSimilar words were reported by Pakistani media outlet Geo TV. According to their report, the man was a guard of a local company who said to the woman, \u201cNow I will see how she does not confess to the theft and does not return the stolen items.\u201d This was, however, not the transcription provided by India Today (mentioned earlier in the article).\n\nThe video of the above-stated incident first appeared on the internet in 2015. India Today\u2019s reportage on atrocities faced by Pakistani Hindus was broadcasted a year later. The media outlet had included a wrong video that was played multiple times throughout their show. While there are multiple reports of forced conversions, especially from the Sindh province of Pakistan, including a 2012 instance of Manisha Kumari as mentioned in the India Today broadcast, the footage of the uniformed man hitting a woman has no connection with religious conversions.", "lang": "en"}
