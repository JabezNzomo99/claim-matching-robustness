People posted emotional patriotic comments on his tweet almost believing these images related to Pulwama.\n\nOne user @ben10jt slammed Major Poonia on Twitter calling his post as \"bluff\".\n\nBy using reverse image search we found that both the images are of different incidents and of different times. The first image with coffins is not of Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, but of a deadliest Maoist attack in Sukma, Chhattishgarh in 2017, which killed 25 CRPF jawans.\n\nThis same image has been used by many websites like India Spend and Business Standard, which has used this photo giving courtesy to Reuters.\n\nThe second picture was originally used by The Seattle Times in July, 2011, with the caption \"Indian armed forces personnel react to the heat during a march at India Gate after a tribute ceremony to commemorate 12 years since the victory of the Kargil war in New Delhi on July 26, 2011\".\n\nSo this is not a picture of soldiers who are wiping off their sweat from the face after the drill. This picture was misused with false narratives several times in 2016 after Uri attacks on various social media platforms.", "lang": "en"}
