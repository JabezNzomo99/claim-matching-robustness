That\u2019s fake news.\n\nAn Aug. 30 post on OurLandofTheFree.com claimed the foundation \"is using an outdated rule for non-profits\" that would allow it \"to compete in the free market regardless of who the competition is.\u2019\"\n\nThe headline says, \"Clinton Foundations (sic) sends water to Houston\u2026for $7 a bottle.\"\n\nThe post claims that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is under contract to pay for water and other items \"due to Obama era rules that give special consideration to \u2018compassionate liberals\u2019 who own non-profits.\" The website also said the Clintons stand to funnel to themselves hundreds of millions of dollars that would come through the foundation for flood relief.\n\nBut posts on OurLandofTheFree.com should not be taken as serious reporting.\n\nThe website\u2019s About Us page says, \"All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they\u2019re not. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\"\n\nThe Clinton Foundation, founded by former President Bill Clinton, also refuted the post\u2019s claims.\n\n\"This story is totally fabricated. We have encouraged people to donate to relief efforts on the ground. Nothing in this story is true,\" said Brian Cookstra, Clinton Foundation spokesman.\n\nIn an Aug. 28 Medium post, the Clinton Foundation published a list of members of the foundation's community who are providing relief to survivors of Hurricane Harvey. Those organizations include the American Red Cross, Houston Food Bank and Americares, which the foundation said has responded to requests for water and medications.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation is an international humanitarian charity that came under scrutiny by Hillary Clinton opponents during the 2016 presidential campaign. (PolitiFact fact-checked several claims related to the foundation and how it compares to the Trump Foundation.)\n\nBill Clinton has supported national relief efforts in the past, but that was done through separate partnerships. For instance, he worked with former President George H.W. Bush to create a charity, the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, to help survivors of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nA claim from OurLandofTheFree.com that the Clinton Foundation is charging $7 per bottle of water sent to Houston after Hurricane Harvey is made up.
