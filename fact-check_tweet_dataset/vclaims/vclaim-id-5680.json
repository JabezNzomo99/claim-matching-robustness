The baby was apparently born in the state of Tabasco just hours after the referendum.\n\nThe story quickly took on a life of its own:\n\nCan you believe this? Look at this case of a purported birth certificate circulating on social media, in which a baby girl born yesterday, just hours after the referendum ended, was given the name \u201cBreksit\u201d. Although the baby\u2019s parents get points for their creativity for their transliteration of the Anglicism \u201cBrexit\u201d, we aren\u2019t convinced by the decision to put that name on this child. Didn\u2019t they think of the bullying? In the past few years, there have been initiatives put in place to prohibit parents from giving strange names to their children. Apparently, this message hasn\u2019t reached Tabasco\u2026\n\nAccording to some versions of the story, little Breksit would have been Bremain \u2014 had the the majority of British voters decided to stay in the European Union.\n\nHowever, as entertaining as it is (and despite the existence of unusual names in Mexico, as in any other country) this story isn\u2019t true. It was swiftly debunked by ElPais.com, a Madrid-based Spanish-language news outlet, which pointed out that the birth certificate appears to have been digitally manipulated:\n\nWe contacted a representative from the registrar\u2019s office of Comalcalco (Tabasco), which was supposedly issued the document, who told us that the record is false. In an email, the representative explained that the date of birth (June 24, 2016) cannot be after the record date (March 18, 1997), as shown in the document.\n\nFurthermore, Villa de Tecolutilla (the name of the place little Breksit was allegedly born) is an anachronism, as the municipality declared that it was a city, not a village, in 2014. That means any birth certificates issued from the region after 2014 would reflect the change from \u201cvilla\u201d to \u201cciudad\u201d.\n\nFinally, and most damning of all, a birth certificate with a few different details but with the same place of birth and registration number appeared in a news story in 2015:\n\nWhile there may be baby Breksits born somewhere in the world, this birth certificate is a hoax.", "lang": "en"}
