Kanwal quoted a Fox News interview as the source of his claim.\n\nKanwal\u2019s claim came on heels of the controversy regarding the use of the term \u2018retaliation\u2019 by President Trump with regard to his request for HCQ and India\u2019s ban on its export.\n\nIndia had prohibited HCQ exports \u2018without any exception\u2019 on April 4. However, on April 6 India changed its stance and agreed that it will supply HCQ and paracetamol to neighbours as well as countries badly hit by the coronavirus \u201cin view of the humanitarian aspects of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nAlt News watched the telephone interview of Trump to Hannity on Fox News and found no mention of giving early access of vaccine to India.\n\nAt 8.35 in the video, Trump can be heard saying, \u201cI bought millions of doses [of HCQ]. More than 29 million. I spoke to PM Modi, a lot of it comes out of India. I asked him if he would release it? He was Great. He was really good. You know they put a stop because they wanted it for India. But there is a lot of good things coming from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cLot of people looking at it and saying, you know I don\u2019t hear bad stories, I hear good stories. And I don\u2019t hear anything where it is causing death. So it is not something like,\u201d he continues while subsequently talking about vaccines, \u201cYou know we are doing vaccines. Johnson and Johnson, they need to test that. When you inoculate, when you give millions of shots of a vaccine, its got to be safe. But this [HCQ] has been in the market for decades. It\u2019s worked very well. They are finding that people, like in the malaria countries, it doesn\u2019t seem that those countries have been hit [with coronavirus] because people take it.\u201d\n\nIt is worthwhile to note that if early access to vaccines to India was suggested by Trump, it would have got extensive media coverage in India. However, the \u2018news\u2019 has not even been covered by India Today.\n\nIndia\u2019s decision to lift the ban and agree to supply HCQ to the US has given rise to several unfounded claims by PM Modi\u2019s supporters regarding the positive outcomes as a result of the decision.\n\nTwitter user Rishi Bagree tweeted that in return for the drug, US agreed to provide unrestricted access to US market for Indian Pharma companies and lifted all bans levied by US FDA. His tweet was shared over 12k times and liked by over 35k users.\n\nBagree however is known to have circulated misinformation on many occasions and needless to say, this time around too his claims were not backed with evidence or media reports.\n\nKanwal\u2019s tweet garnered 5.4k retweets and 24k likes at the time of writing. Several Twitter users asked the journalist to disclose at what point in the interview Trump suggested that India could have early access to COVID-19 vaccines. So far he has neither answered nor provided any clarification.", "lang": "en"}
