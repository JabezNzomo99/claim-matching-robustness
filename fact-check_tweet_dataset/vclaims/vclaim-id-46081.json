The text attached to the caption claims that the pictures were taken in Uttar Pradesh when a sub-inspector and three constables were beaten up for enforcing the lockdown.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found the claim to be misleading.\n\nWe put the image through Reverse Image Serch and found that the first three images were taken in 2017.\n\nAccording to a report by The Mirror, in 2017, a girl was allegedly raped in an intensive care unit (ICU) of Jagriti Hospital in Kanpur. These pictures were taken when an angry mob rioted and attacked the police.\n\nOn further investigation, we found that a sub-inspector and three constables were indeed injured when some people attacked them while they were trying to enforce lockdown in the Morna area in Muzaffarnagar on April 1.\n\nThe above information proves that even though the incident is true, most of the pictures being circulated along with the news, is from an old post. Hence, the above post is misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
