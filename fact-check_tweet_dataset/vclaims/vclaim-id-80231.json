Hontiveros the return of P163.85 million in bonuses,\u201d Karen Recio, a public information officer with the COA, told AFP in an e-mail.\n\nThe post carrying the false claim has been shared more than 12,000 times to Facebook groups with combined followers of at least 2.6 million people, according to data from social media monitoring platform CrowdTangle.\n\nMost of the groups and pages that shared it support President Rodrigo Duterte.
