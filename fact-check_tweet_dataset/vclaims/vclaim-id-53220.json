Tulsi Gabbard a \u201cright-wing extremist.\u201d\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard, a Democrat, whose political views are considered to be similar to Bernie Sanders, is being labeled a \u2018right-wing extremist\u2019 by the Liberal New York Times \u2013 in case you wondered what the political spectrum now looks like,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found no instance of the NYT calling Gabbard a \u201cright-wing extremist.\u201d\n\nThe NYT published an article titled \u201cWhat, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?\u201d on Oct. 12. In that article, reporter Lisa Lerer observed that an \u201cunusual array of Americans\u201d have expressed support for Gabbard.\n\n\u201cOn podcasts and online videos, in interviews and Twitter feeds, alt-right internet stars, white nationalists, libertarian activists and some of the biggest boosters of Mr. Trump heap praise on Ms. Gabbard,\u201d wrote Lerer.\n\nGabbard, who threatened to boycott the recent Democratic primary debate in Ohio, called it a \u201csmear piece\u201d on Twitter.\n\n\u201cAs if to prove my point, NYT just published a \u2018greatest hits\u2019 smear piece,\u201d tweeted Gabbard after the release of the article. \u201cAll your favorite hits in one article! These are the folks who will be acting as the \u2018neutral\u2019 questioners/moderators of Tuesday\u2019s debate lol.\u201d\n\nSome political commentators have argued that it portrays Gabbard as a \u201cright-wing extremist,\u201d and it\u2019s possible that these characterizations of the article spurred the claim that appears in the Facebook post.\n\nYet, while some have called it a \u201chit piece,\u201d nowhere in the article was Gabbard labeled a \u201cright-wing extremist,\u201d as the Facebook post claims. The DCNF also searched for instances in the NYT archive but found none.\n\nGabbard\u2019s campaign has so far been defined by her anti-war, non-interventionist foreign policy stance and her break from other Democratic candidates, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, on such issues as the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, abortion and decriminalization of illegal crossings at the southern border.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
