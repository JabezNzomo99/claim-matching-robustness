Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nThe budget speech document of the Finance Minister can be found on the India Budget website. When searched for the words \u2018LED bulb\u2019 in the document, the info on the LED bulbs can be found in the 74th paragraph. The document reads, \u201cApproximately 35 crore LED bulbs have been distributed under UJALA Yojana leading to cost saving of 18,341 crores annually.\u201d\n\nIt is clear that it is 35 crore bulbs, not 35000 crore bulbs. But, the Finance Minister may have misread the document in her speech. To check that, her budget speech in the parliament can be seen on the PIB YouTube channel. In the video, she refers to the number of LED bulbs twice, at 1:05:40 and 1:06:07. Both times she said that the government distributed \u2019approximately 35 crore LED bulbs\u2019. So, she did not misread the document and she clearly said \u201935 crore bulbs\u2019, not 35,000 crore bulbs.\n\nAlso, the LED\u2019s Distribution Dashboard on the official website of UJALA shows the number to be around 35 crores.\n\nTo sum it up, Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech said 35 crore LED bulbs, not 35000 crore LED bulbs.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
