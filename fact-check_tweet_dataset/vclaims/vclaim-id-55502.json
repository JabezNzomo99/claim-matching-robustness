Kumar, a resident of Chandwa, had come to Ranchi to meet the woman. They were riding a bike on Patratu Valley when they got into an argument and Kumar stabbed the woman. She screamed and tried to escape when passers-by spotted her and apprehended Kumar who was later arrested by Pithoria police. The incident was reported by Prabhat Khabar and Etv Bharat, which we found via a keyword search on Google.\n\nAlt News contacted Pithoria police and was told that the woman had been ignoring Kumar\u2019s calls who confronted her regarding the matter. Enraged with her audacity, he stabbed her with a knife. The police further informed that the woman hailed from the same community as the perpetrator.\n\nA video of men thrashing a person who knifed a woman allegedly over a spat between the couple has been presented on social media with a communal angle. Incidents of crimes against women are often circulated on social media with false claims pinning the blame on the Muslim community. Earlier, cases from Pakistan (1, 2) were shared with the same narrative in the Indian social media ecosystem. Videos are often promoted with a bogus \u2018love jihad\u2019 spin. Recently, a video of a father removing his turban in front of his daughter in hopes that she does not marry the man she loved was presented with similar claims despite both of them being Hindus.\n\n[Note: This article was updated after the Tanishq controversy sparked by the jewellery brand featuring an interfaith baby shower in its advertisement. Tweets reviving the incident with false claims in November 2020 were also added to the story.]", "lang": "en"}
