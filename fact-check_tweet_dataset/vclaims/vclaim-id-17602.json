But Mueller\u2019s report makes clear that his office believed McGahn\u2019s version, and laid out several reasons for its conclusion.\n\u2022 Barr said special counsel Mueller \u201cnever pushed\u201d to have investigators interview President Donald Trump, even after finding the president\u2019s written responses were inadequate. Mueller did not attempt to subpoena Trump, but he made multiple attempts to obtain a sit-down interview, including once in a letter after Trump submitted his written responses.\n\nOn May 1, Barr took questions for nearly four hours from the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Mueller report. The redacted report, which was released April 18, found that the \u201cRussian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.\u201d It did so through \u201ca social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton,\u201d and \u201ccomputer-intrusion operations\u201d against Clinton and Democratic committees that were designed to \u201cundermine the Clinton Campaign.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the committee spent a lot of its time questioning Barr about whether the president obstructed justice.\n\nThe report says the investigation \u201cestablished multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government,\u201d but it \u201cdid not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\u201d As for obstruction of justice, the Mueller report said that while it \u201cdoes not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d\n\nThe report \u201cfound multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations.\u201d But Mueller refrained from recommending prosecution, saying the evidence about \u201cthe President\u2019s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making a traditional prosecutorial judgment.\u201d\n\nHowever, Barr \u2014 prior to releasing the redacted reported \u2014 announced that his office would not bring any charges against Trump. \u201cDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\u201d Barr wrote.\n\nBarr\u2019s decision not to bring obstruction charges was the focal point of the Senate hearing.\n\nOne incident that was part of the obstruction investigation involved Trump and White House counsel McGahn.\n\nMcGahn told investigators that Trump asked him to have Mueller removed as special counsel. In his testimony, Barr said there was a \u201cvery plausible alternative explanation\u201d for McGahn\u2019s claim. But the Mueller report makes clear that it buys McGahn\u2019s version, and laid out a series of reasons why it reached that conclusion.\n\nIn sworn testimony, McGahn told investigators that Trump called him twice on June 17, 2017, and ordered him to call Rosenstein, who at that point was overseeing the investigation, and have Mueller removed as special counsel based on conflicts of interest that Trump believed existed with Mueller (even though advisers told the president those alleged conflicts were \u201cridiculous\u201d). McGahn recalls Trump telling him on the second call, \u201cMueller has to go.\u201d\n\nMcGahn said he had no intention of relaying the president\u2019s message to Rosenstein, deciding at that time that he would resign if the president persisted.\n\nThen, after the New York Times subsequently reported that Trump \u201cordered the firing\u201d of Mueller and backed down only after McGahn \u201cthreatened to resign rather than carry out the directive,\u201d the special counsel report says, Trump repeatedly tried to get McGahn to correct the story. McGahn refused, saying the story was essentially accurate.\n\nDuring Barr\u2019s Senate testimony on May 1, several Democratic senators asked Barr why he didn\u2019t pursue an obstruction charge against Trump based on those facts.\n\nBarr said the evidence was not sufficient to establish an obstruction charge, in part because there was \u201ca very plausible alternative explanation\u201d for McGahn\u2019s version of events.\n\nTrump did not agree to provide written answers to any questions about obstruction, so he did not address, under oath, McGahn\u2019s contention that Trump asked him to have Mueller removed. But according to McGahn\u2019s testimony, Trump did take issue with the characterization that he asked McGahn to \u201cfire\u201d Mueller.\n\nAccording to McGahn, Trump told him, \u201cI never said to fire Mueller. I never said \u2018fire.\u2019\u201d According to the report, McGahn recalled that Trump \u201csaid he merely wanted McGahn to raise the conflicts issue with Rosenstein and leave it to him to decide what to do.\u201d McGahn said he immediately pushed back, telling the president, \u201che did not understand the conversation that way and instead had heard, \u2018Call Rod. There are conflicts. Mueller has to go.'\u201d\n\nIn his Senate testimony, Barr drew a distinction between \u201csaying to someone, go fire him, go fire Mueller, and saying have him removed based on conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something very different between firing a special counsel outright, which suggests ending the investigation, and having a special counsel removed for conflict, which suggests that you\u2019re going to have another special counsel,\u201d Barr said.\n\nIn other words, Barr is arguing that Trump may have had good reason to believe the New York Times story was false.\n\nBarr, referring to himself and Rosenstein, said: \u201cSo, we believe that it would be impossible for the government to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the president understood that he was instructing McGahn to say something false because it wasn\u2019t necessarily false.\u201d\n\nAlthough there are two versions of Trump\u2019s instructions to McGahn, the special counsel report makes clear that it believes McGahn\u2019s version, as we have written before.\n\nAnd here are some of the reasons why:\n\nAround the same time Trump talked to McGahn, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u201crecalled a telephone call with the President in which the President asked what Christie thought about the President firing the Special Counsel,\u201d the report states. Christie advised against it.\n\nThe report also says there is evidence the president was aware that he should not have given McGahn those instructions.\n\n\u201cThe President made the calls to McGahn after McGahn had specifically told the President that the White House Counsel\u2019s Office \u2014 and McGahn himself \u2014 could not be involved in pressing conflict claims and that the President should consult with his personal counsel if he wished to raise conflicts,\u201d the report says. \u201cInstead of relying on his personal counsel to submit the conflicts claims, the President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel. And after the media reported on the President\u2019s actions, he denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story. \u2026 Those denials are contrary to the evidence and suggest the President\u2019s awareness that the direction to McGahn could be seen as improper.\u201d\n\nIn his report, Mueller notes that Trump\u2019s rebuttals of McGahn\u2019s recollection were \u201ccarefully worded\u201d and that Trump focused on whether he had used the word \u201cfire.\u201d Mueller wrote that \u201csubstantial evidence supports McGahn\u2019s account that the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel removed\u201d and that Trump\u2019s \u201cassertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed \u2026 runs counter to the evidence.\u201d\n\nThe report states that McGahn has a \u201cclear recollection\u201d of Trump\u2019s directive: \u201cMueller has to go.\u201d And the report states, \u201cMcGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.\u201d The report notes that McGahn relayed to several White House staffers that in response to Trump\u2019s request, he had decided to quit, that he packed up his office and prepared to submit a resignation letter. \u201cThose acts would be a highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Department of Justice,\u201d the Mueller report states.\n\nThe report also notes that Trump, through his counsel, already had brought his complaints about Mueller\u2019s purported conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice, so \u201cthe President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues that already had been raised.\u201d\n\nThe report concludes that \u201cthe President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel.\u201d\n\nBarr also said Mueller never \u201cpushed\u201d Trump to provide an interview in person, even after finding the president\u2019s written response to investigators to be inadequate. Mueller decided not to pursue a subpoena to try to compel the president to testify, but he did make one more written request for a sit-down interview.\n\nIn a Dec. 3, 2018, letter to Trump\u2019s personal counsel, sent two weeks after Trump provided written responses to Mueller, the special counsel pointed out the \u201cinsufficiency of those responses\u201d and made yet another appeal for an in-person interview. Such an interview, the special counsel\u2019s office wrote, would provide Trump an \u201copportunity to voluntarily provide us with information for us to evaluate in the context of all of the evidence we have gathered.\u201d Trump again declined.\n\nThe issue of Trump\u2019s interview arose when Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy questioned Barr about his claim during a press conference just prior to release of the redacted Mueller report that the White House had \u201cfully cooperated\u201d with the special counsel\u2019s investigation (a claim that we examined in our story \u201cWhat the Mueller Report Says About Obstruction\u201c).\n\nWe can be more definitive than Barr: Trump never testified in person with the special counsel investigators.\n\nWhen Barr said, \u201cHe never pushed it,\u201d it wasn\u2019t entirely clear to us whether Barr meant that Mueller had never pushed for an in-person interview, or that he had not pushed for one after the president provided written responses. But neither is accurate.\n\nAccording to the redacted report written by Mueller\u2019s office, beginning in December 2017, the special counsel\u2019s office \u201csought for more than a year to interview the President on topics relevant to both Russian-election interference and obstruction-of-justice.\u201d In one May 16, 2018, letter, the special counsel advised the president that an interview with him was \u201cvital to our investigation.\u201d The letter also said \u201cit is in the interest of the Presidency and the public for an interview to take place\u201d and offered \u201cnumerous accommodations to aid the President\u2019s preparation and avoid surprise.\u201d After extensive negotiations with the Department of Justice, those \u201caccommodations\u201d included written questions provided to the president.\n\nThe special counsel received Trump\u2019s written responses \u2014 which were made public in Appendix C of the Mueller report \u2014 in late November.\n\nIn the December letter to Trump\u2019s personal attorney, the special counsel\u2019s office \u201cinformed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several respects,\u201d the Mueller report said. \u201cWe noted, among other things, that the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he \u2018does not \u2018recall\u2019 or \u2018remember\u2019 or have an \u2018independent recollection\u2019 of information called for by the questions. Other answers were \u2018incomplete or imprecise.\u2019 The written responses, we informed counsel, \u2018demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask followup questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client\u2019s recollection or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection.'\u201d\n\nIn that letter, the special counsel \u201cagain requested an in-person interview, limited to certain topics, advising the President\u2019s counsel that \u2018[t]his is the President\u2019s opportunity to voluntarily provide us with information for us to evaluate in the context of all of the evidence we have gathered.\u2019 The President declined.\u201d\n\nSo the special counsel\u2019s office continued to \u201cpush\u201d for an in-person interview, even after getting Trump\u2019s written responses. However, the special counsel decided not to issue a subpoena for his testimony, though it was considered.\n\n\u201cWe viewed the written answers to be inadequate,\u201d the Mueller report states. \u201cBut at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report. We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report.\u201d Ultimately, the report states, the special counsel\u2019s office \u201cdetermined that the substantial quantity of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant factual conclusions on intent and credibility, which are often inferred from circumstantial evidence and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the investigation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
