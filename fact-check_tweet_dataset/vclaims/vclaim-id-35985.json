More so, the like for like similarity of the claim with previous ones (as far back as 2009), cannot be denied. Regardless, the logical course of action would be to drive to a safe location; if and when attacked via the aforementioned means.\n\nMr. Anjugurijesse Manzah the PRO F.C.T Command recently responded to the calls Dubawa put through. Being in a position privy to reliable intel, we relied on the PRO\u2019s testimony to refute the claim. According to him, the image did not emanate from the FCT Command. Additionally, the PRO for the Nigerian Police Force retorted, \u201cIf it\u2019s not on our Facebook page, or on our website, then it is certainly not from the police force.\u201d\n\nPerusing through their Facebook page and websites revealed no traces of the image in question.\n\nFurthermore, extensive research conducted revealed that this hoax was first shared through a mailing list and Facebook post; as far back as October 29, 2009 and June 2015. This hoax was reported and fact-checked by different western sites who all refuted its authenticity.\n\nRegardless of all the available data debunking this hoax, a Youtube video inclusive, we shall still attempt to re-examine it. There are too many variables to account for when considering the implied outcome of a windscreen egg attack. Firstly, how much of the driver\u2019s vision obstructed would depend on the number of eggs thrown on the windscreen. The size of the eggs thrown is another factor; where exactly they would land should be considered. Finally, the operability of the vehicle\u2019s wiper and washer system is yet another variable amongst others. Consequently, concluding that it will block one\u2019s vision by 92.5% is rather absurd.\n\nHowever, a report revealed that shortly after the message\u2019s circulation, the Police at Derbyshire, England accounted for its occurrence \u2013 at least once. According to the police report, the robbery was rare and under investigation at the time. In the same vein, Regina Police in Canada also investigated a similar incidence in 2015. These isolated occurrences show that although rare, it is plausible.\n\nNonetheless, it is worthy to note the intent behind this post. Granted, the veracity is disingenuous, the message is still important. And as such, Dubawa advises the public to be cautious in any given environment. This is especially imperative in precarious situations with respect to time of day or location; consequent on the prevalent state of insecurity in the country.\n\nAt this point in time, we cannot refute the claim originated from the Police Command; as there has been no official word yet. Although, the like for like similarity of the claim with previous ones (as far back as 2009), cannot be denied. Regardless, the logical course of action would be to drive to a safe location; if and when attacked via the aforementioned means.", "lang": "en"}
