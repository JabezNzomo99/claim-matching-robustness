The claim is false; county officials confirmed to AFP Fact Check that while the video was indeed taken during a burial ceremony, the man seen lying on the ground wearing protective gear had fainted and is a relative of the deceased.\n\nOn August 23, a Facebook post that has since been viewed more than 40,000 times shared the video alongside the caption: \u201cMeanwhile, in Kipsigis, a COVID patient was nearly buried alive. MoH has really bungled this pandemic and the best thing they could all do is resign (sic).\u201d\n\nKipsigis refers to the Nilotic group of people in Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley region, while \u201cMoH\u201d refers to the ministry of health.\n\nIn the three-and-a-half-minute recording, two people dressed in light blue personal protective equipment (PPE) are seen undressing a third person who is wearing the same protective gear and lying on the ground. It is not immediately clear what is happening from watching the video.\n\nAnother Facebook post shared the same claim, adding that the incident happened in Rift Valley.\n\n\u201cKenya...Kenya...My Motherland. The Land That Buries her children alive. A COVID-19 patient almost buries alive in Rift Valley (sic),\u201d the post reads.\n\nHowever, the claims are false.\n\nAccording to guidelines from Kenya\u2019s ministry of health, corpses infected with Covid-19 are placed in tamper-proof body bags. In this video, however, the man claimed to be the deceased is wearing PPE and is not in a body bag.\n\nStanley Mutai, the disaster management officer in Bomet County, which is located in Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley region, told AFP Fact Check that while the clip was recorded during a burial ceremony in one of the villages, the claims about the deceased being discovered alive are false.\n\n\u201cThe claims are not true at all. We have been conducting burials of Covid-19 patients and lately, relatives have been requesting us to allow them to participate by carrying the coffin to the grave. At this particular funeral which took place in Chepkitwal village, one of the [families] made the request and as per standard procedure, one of the relatives had to wear the PPE,\u201d said Mutai.\n\n\u201cThe PPE can be quite uncomfortable for someone who is not used to them and I think that is what led to the man fainting,\u201d he added.\n\nGilbert Korir, a county surveillance officer who was present during the burial, told AFP Fact Check that the man was taken to hospital after receiving first aid at the burial site.\n\n\u201cThis particular burial took place on August 13, 2020, and the man laying on the ground is definitely not the deceased. He fainted after we carried the coffin to the gravesite. The people helping to undress him are our public health officers on the ground, who also took him to the hospital,\u201d Korir said.", "lang": "en"}
