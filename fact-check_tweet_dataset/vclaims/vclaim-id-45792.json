Donations go to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. The funds first pass through a nonprofit that sponsors the group.\n\nAs the Black Lives Matter movement captures national attention, websites and social media posts are spreading a false claim about donations made to a leading Black Lives Matter organization.\n\nAn Instagram page for the website WokeHub.com claimed, for example, that \u201cdonations made to Black Lives Matter website go directly to the DNC\u201d and that BlackLivesMatter.com \u201cappears to be an international money laundering program used by the Democratic National Committee.\u201d A similar claim appeared on the conspiracy theory website InfoWars.com.\n\nConservative personality Candace Owens also put the claim before her more than 1 million followers on Instagram, where she claimed \u201cBLACK LIVES MATTER FUNDING GOES DIRECTLY TO WHITE DEMOCRATS AND THEIR VARIOUS INITIATIVES TO GET DEMOCRATS INTO OFFICE.\u201d\n\nBut the claims \u2014 perhaps worsened by public confusion over the structure of the organization, which we\u2019ll explain later \u2014 are based on a distortion of facts regarding the nonprofit ActBlue, which provides fundraising infrastructure to Democratic campaigns and progressive organizations.\n\nThere are a number of groups that use the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in their name. There is a \u201cBlack Lives Matter Foundation,\u201d for example, whose president confirmed to us that it is not related to the organization behind BlackLivesMatter.com \u2014 which is at the center of the viral claims.\n\nBlackLivesMatter.com is operated by an umbrella Black Lives Matter organization called the Black Lives Matter Global Network. The effort started in 2013 following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin.\n\nTo collect donations, the website uses ActBlue Charities, a 501(c)(3) organization that specifically makes the platform available to charitable organizations.\n\nOwens\u2019 Instagram post features a video showing that BlackLivesMatter.com uses ActBlue for its donations. It then shows an OpenSecrets.org breakdown of expenditures by ActBlue made in the 2020 cycle; the top recipients are the presidential campaigns of Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nBut the video misrepresents how ActBlue works. ActBlue isn\u2019t itself donating money. It\u2019s just the online platform that campaigns and groups use to solicit and collect donations.\n\nCampaign finance experts told us that it\u2019s false to say that donations to the Black Lives Matter group are going to the Democratic National Committee, or to Democratic presidential campaigns, simply because the website uses ActBlue.\n\n\u201cActBlue lets candidates and liberal nonprofit organizations set up their separate accounts,\u201d Michael Malbin, director of the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, told us in a phone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no crossing from one account to another. If you give the money to Sanders, it does not go to Biden.\u201d\n\nMalbin \u2014 a professor of political science at the University at Albany, State University of New York \u2014 said candidates and organizations use ActBlue \u201cfor the ease of transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cActBlue has no discretion over\u201d where to direct individuals\u2019 contributions, he said. The money \u201cyou see coming through ActBlue is coming through it, not from it.\u201d\n\nA similar platform used for Republican fundraising efforts, WinRed, launched in 2019.\n\n\u201cWhen you donate on an ActBlue or ActBlue Charities page, the donation is earmarked for the group listed on the form,\u201d Caleb Cade, a spokesperson for ActBlue, told us in an email. \u201cWe pass along the contribution directly to the receiving campaign or entity. We do not choose the recipient of the contribution, the donor does.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to FactCheck.org, the Black Lives Matter Global Network\u2019s managing director, Kailee Scales, said that the claims about the money being routed to Democrats are part of \u201can organized disinformation campaign against BLM, from actors clearly trying to blunt the growing support for this movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll contributions to the DNC are publicly reported to the FEC and review of FEC reports will confirm there has never been any donation from this organization,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Operations of the Black Lives Matter Global Network\n\nThe claims seem to have flourished amid confusion over the structure of the Black Lives Matter Global Network, which is incorporated in Delaware.\n\nThe ActBlue donations page on the website specifically says that the money given will \u201cbenefit Black Lives Matter Global Network.\u201d\n\nTechnically, the network also has structured a foundation \u2014 the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation \u2014 which is \u201cfiscally sponsored\u201d by a global nonprofit called Thousand Currents, according to Jenesha de Rivera, director of finance and administration at Thousand Currents.\n\nThe partnership between the network and the nonprofit (formerly the International Development Exchange) was announced in 2016. The nonprofit organization said it would provide \u201cfiduciary oversight, financial management, and other administrative services to BLM.\u201d\n\nCade, the ActBlue spokesperson, confirmed that the donations made through ActBlue go to Thousand Currents for Black Lives Matter.\n\n\u201cUsing a fiscal sponsorship arrangement offers a way for a cause to attract donors even when it is not yet recognized as tax-exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3),\u201d according to the National Council on Nonprofits. \u201cIn essence the fiscal sponsor serves as the administrative \u2018home\u2019 of the cause. Charitable contributions are given to the fiscal sponsor, which then grants them to support the cause.\u201d\n\nBlack Lives Matter Global Network Foundation \u201cis an organization within Thousand Currents,\u201d de Rivera said in a phone interview, \u201cso it can accomplish its charitable purpose prior to receiving its approval from the IRS for its own 501(c)(3).\u201d\n\nDe Rivera said the foundation has applied to become its own 501(c)(3). We asked the Black Lives Matter group for a copy of its Form 1023, which is used to apply for that designation, but didn\u2019t hear back. An IRS spokesperson said copies are only publicly available if the organization is approved for 501(c)(3) status.\n\nOn the claims that money is being given to Democratic campaigns, de Rivera said that Thousand Currents\u2019 own 501(c)(3) status would be \u201cin jeopardy\u201d if charitable donations made through the organization were rerouted to political campaigns.\n\nAccording to the IRS, \u201call section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity.\u201d\n\nA Thousand Currents audit for 2019 shows that, as of June 2019, the organization held nearly $3.4 million in net assets for Black Lives Matter. It had released nearly $1.8 million to the group in the last fiscal year.\n\nThe audit also provides a breakdown of how the foundation (referred to as the \u201cfiscal project\u201d under a statement of functional expenses, according to de Rivera) spent that $1.8 million in buckets \u2014 including on consultants and salaries.\n\nSpeaking generally about the issue of fiscal sponsorships, Benjamin Leff, a law professor at American University who specializes in the regulation of nonprofits, told us by phone that \u201cthe sponsoring organization is responsible\u201d for ensuring \u201cthat the sponsored organization spends the money in a way that is consistent with the law.\u201d He said the sponsored organization does not have to file its own Forms 990.\n\nAnd, Leff said in an email, because ActBlue Charities is also a 501(c)(3), it is his \u201cunderstanding \u2026 that both ActBlue Charities and Thousand Currents have a legal obligation to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the funds they receive are spent consistent with 501(c)(3) restrictions.\u201d\n\nOn June 11, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation said in a press release that, thanks to donations, it would make $6.5 million available through grants that will be available to \u201call chapters affiliated\u201d with it.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
