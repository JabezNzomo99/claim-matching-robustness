The tax legislation before Congress would not close loopholes that benefit President Trump and real estate developers like him.\n\nPresident Trump likes to argue that the tax-reform legislation hurtling through Congress this week will protect low- and middle-income households, \u201cnot the wealthy and well connected.\u201d He puts himself forward as Exhibit A. \u201cThis is going to cost me a fortune,\u201d he said on Wednesday in Missouri. \u201cThis is not good for me.\u201d So surely at least a few of the most egregious loopholes that benefit Mr. Trump and real estate developers like him will be closed. In fact, the proposals seem almost tailor-made to enrich the president and people like him. \u201cCommercial real estate came out essentially unscathed,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative advocacy group. Real estate developers \u201cdidn\u2019t lose anything they care about,\u201d and they got even more breaks, like a shorter depreciation schedule in the Senate tax bill, Mr. Holtz-Eakin pointed out.\n\n\u201cLower pass-through rates and the repeal of the alternative minimum tax \u2014 those two alone are so hugely beneficial to Trump that I have trouble imagining any way that he wouldn\u2019t come out ahead,\u201d said Steve Wamhoff, senior fellow for federal tax policy at the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. (The pass-through reference involves income that typically comes from partnerships and limited liability companies.) Not only that, but rental income, royalty payments and licensing fees \u2014 some of the president\u2019s major sources of income \u2014 get especially favorable treatment under new rates for pass-through income. (Mr. Trump\u2019s assets include more than 500 pass-through partnerships and limited liability companies.) \u201cTrump will make out like a bandit on all the big items,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n\nAs many people have pointed out, the \u201cwealthy and well connected,\u201d as Mr. Trump described them, will benefit disproportionately from the proposed legislation. That\u2019s in large part because the big tax cuts for corporations heavily favor shareholders, and the wealthy own a disproportionate amount of stocks and other assets. Many wealthy taxpayers will also benefit from the lower rates on pass-through income, since such income accrues overwhelmingly to the wealthiest taxpayers. And I have already pointed out that the modest changes proposed for the tax treatment of so-called carried interest \u2014 one of the most egregious loopholes \u2014 would have little or no impact on those who benefit from it, including wealthy real estate developers. Even among that affluent population, the additional breaks that would benefit Mr. Trump and a small cadre of real estate developers like him stand out. Consider one of the most criticized loopholes in the current tax code: the exemption from taxation of so-called like-kind exchanges. That has enabled owners of property to sell at a large capital gain but defer any tax as long as they use the proceeds to buy some other property.\n\nOne of the biggest reforms in the tax legislation would limit the ability of businesses to deduct interest payments from their taxable income while giving them the ability to expense capital improvements (rather than depreciate them). Commercial real estate interests had howled over this provision, because they rely so heavily on debt to finance their operations. As is the case with properties owned by most developers, Mr. Trump\u2019s properties appear to be highly leveraged. While he has not disclosed his exact borrowings, he has called himself the \u201cking of debt\u201d and a New York Times investigation found that his companies had borrowed at least $650 million. Other estimates have gone above $1 billion. And, in another windfall for people like Mr. Trump, both the House and Senate bills exempt \u201cany real property trade or business\u201d from the limitation on deducting business interest. How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they\u2019re technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don\u2019t impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won\u2019t owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you\u2019ve already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren\u2019t automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in \u2014 and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you\u2019re self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker. The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. \u201cEmployees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home,\u201d the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child\u2019s school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit \u2014 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can\u2019t include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more. The list goes on. In both the House and Senate legislation, only certain kinds of income are eligible for the lower pass-through rates. Short-term capital gains, dividends, interest and annuity payments do not qualify. But rent, royalties and licensing fees \u2014 all similar in character to the disallowed income \u2014 weren\u2019t included in that list, Mr. Rosenthal pointed out. All remain eligible for the lower pass-through rate. \u201cI call them the Donald J. Trump exceptions,\u201d since the president receives so much income from those sources, Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cTrump will get a huge windfall on his rental, license and royalty income,\u201d he predicted. A major way that losses are generated in real estate ventures is through depreciation, which is supposed to reflect the way that assets lose value over time. But a well-maintained building typically gains value (and maintenance costs are all deductible). So most depreciation charges lead to what the president might call \u201cfake\u201d losses, and they might never be recouped, because taxes on any sale can be deferred through like-kind exchanges. The House and Senate rejected proposals to curb the use of such noncash charges. Instead, the Senate, by shortening the depreciation schedule for commercial property to 25 from 39 years, would accelerate the rate at which real estate investors can take such deductions.\n\nFrom what little is known of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, he used losses to offset virtually all of his taxable income for years by generating something called net operating loss carry-overs. Under both the House and Senate versions, such carry-overs can be used to offset only 90 percent of a person\u2019s taxable income (and, in the Senate version, 80 percent after 2022, which reverts to 90 percent after 2025 if revenue targets are met) in a given year. That is a modest improvement over the existing code, but it still allows for the full offset over time. One of the biggest benefits for the president, and for other wealthy taxpayers with high deductions, is the proposed repeal of the alternative minimum tax. Thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s leaked 2005 tax return, we know that the only reason he paid federal tax of 24 percent of his taxable income that year was because of the alternative minimum tax. (Without it, he would have paid just 4 percent.) The rationale for eliminating the alternative minimum tax is that such a backup system should not be necessary if the tax code is fundamentally fair and eliminates all the loopholes that made it possible for high-income taxpayers to escape taxation in the first place. As should be obvious by now, this legislation expands such loopholes. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me that no real attempt was made to close any of these loopholes,\u201d said Mr. Wamhoff, given that \u201cvirtually every nonpartisan tax expert agrees that commercial real estate is already so favored by the tax code.\u201d Even Democrats, for the most part, have remained silent. Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be so surprising, given that the president is the real-estate-investor-in-chief, and that his personal interests align with one of the country\u2019s most powerful lobbies. \u201cReal estate interests are very powerful when it comes to the tax laws,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got bipartisan support, and it\u2019s been that way forever.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
