Trump hedged in September: \u201cWe were very low \u2026 I don\u2019t want to say \u2018no ammunition.\u2019 \u201d But one month later, the hedges were gone: \u201cOne of our generals came in to see me and he said, \u2018Sir, we don\u2019t have ammunition.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s a terrible thing you just said.\u2019 He said, \u2018We don\u2019t have ammunition.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThe Gulf War showed how radically precision attack had transformed the traditional notion of running a military campaign and, especially, an air campaign,\u201d Richard P. Hallion, an Air Force historian, wrote in a 1995 study. \u201cOn opening night of the war, attacks by strike aircraft and cruise missiles against air defense and command and control facilities essentially opened up Iraq for subsequent conventional attackers. Precision attacks against the Iraqi Air Force destroyed it in its hangars, and precipitated an attempted mass exodus of aircraft to Iran. Key precision weapon attacks against bridges served to \u2018channelize\u2019 the movement of Iraqi forces and create fatal bottlenecks, and many Iraqis, in frustration, simply abandoned their vehicles and walked away.\u201d\n\n\u201cTypically if you drop a bomb today, it\u2019s going to take you two years from now to get the appropriation to replace it, another year or two to actually get it on the shelf,\u201d Gen. Mark Welsh, then the Air Force chief of staff, said in a 2015 interview with Defense News. \u201cStockpiles are down. What we tend to use to replace those stockpiles of weapons used in combat is OCO [overseas contingency operations] funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe military is facing this shortfall because it did not forecast needing this many weapons three or more years ago when it made its budget projections,\u201d Defense One reported that year. \u201cAt the time, no U.S. forces were in Iraq and the military was preparing to withdraw from Afghanistan. But that didn\u2019t happen; thousands of American forces remain in Afghanistan and thousands more have gone back to Iraq to train and advise the Iraqi military. \u2026 [and] allies, in many cases, are dropping American-made, guided smart bombs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States military has literally hundreds of types of ammunition and ordnance at any time,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon said. \u201cSome may have been used recently more than expected. Some may be brand new, such that we have established what the Department of Defense calls a \u2018requirement\u2019 (but anyone else would call a goal or objective) for a certain number, but just not had the time yet to procure the intended total amount.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cWhen I came in, we had no ammunition two and a half years ago. \u2026 The general told me, \u2018Sir, I\u2019m sorry, we have no ammunition.\u2019 And no president should ever be in that position.\u201d (\n\u2022 None \u201cWe had a general come to my office \u2014 respected general. And we were having big trouble with one country \u2014 first week in office, very early. He said, \u2018Sir, we have no ammunition.\u2019 I said: \u2018You know what? We\u2019re going to have ammunition \u2014 a lot of it. And hopefully we\u2019ll never going to have to use it, but we have a lot of it.\u2019 But I also said, \u2018I never want to have another president of the United States to hear those words from a general.\u2019 \u201d (Speech to the Value Voters Summit, Oct. 12)\n\u2022 None \u201cWhen I came into office, a very prominent general told me because it looked like we could have a big conflict with some. He said, \u2018Sir, we have no ammunition.\u2019 \u2026 I never want to have a president hear the words, \u2018Sir, we have no ammunition.\u2019 \u201d (\n\u2022 None \u201cWhen I took over our military, we didn\u2019t have ammunition. I was told by a top general \u2014 maybe the top of them all \u2014 \u2018Sir, I\u2019m sorry. Sir, we don\u2019t have ammunition.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019ll never let another president have that happen to him or her.\u2019 We didn\u2019t have ammunition.\u201d (Remarks at the White House, Oct. 7)\n\u2022 None \u201cWhen I came in, our military was depleted. Frankly, we didn\u2019t have ammunition, okay?\u201d ( News conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the White House , Sept. 20)\n\u2022 None \u201cYou know, when I came here three years ago almost, General Mattis told me, \u2018Sir, we\u2019re very low on ammunition.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s a horrible thing to say.\u2019 I\u2019m not blaming him; I\u2019m not blaming anybody. But that\u2019s what he told me. Because we were at a position where, with a certain country \u2014 I won\u2019t say which one \u2014 we may have had conflict. And he said to me, \u2018Sir, if you could, delay it, because we\u2019re very low on ammunition.\u2019 And I said: \u2018You know what, general? I never want to hear that again from another general.\u2019 No president should ever, ever hear that statement, \u2018We\u2019re low on ammunition.\u2019 \u2026 So, we are very high on ammunition now. That\u2019s a story I\u2019ve never told before. Breaking news. But we have \u2014 we were very low. I could even say it stronger. I don\u2019t want to say, \u2018No ammunition,\u2019 but that gets a lot closer.\u201d (Remarks at the White House, Sept. 16)\n\u2022 None \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I never want to see a president in a position like that, where we may have conflict and a general looks at him and said we have very little, slash, no ammunition.\u2019 \u201d ( Campaign rally in New Mexico , Sept. 16)\n\nTrump usually speaks about an unnamed general warning him of an ammunition shortage, but at one point he name-checked Jim Mattis, a retired general and his former secretary of defense. Mattis in a December 2018 speech said: \u201cGo back in time two years, we were fighting overseas, yet automatic spending caps had resulted in the smallest U.S. military since 1940. We had munition shortages, aircraft unable to fly, ships too often unable to sail, an aging nuclear deterrent, and an eroding technological edge over our adversaries in an era of renewed great power competition.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
