Someone like Donald Trump as crazy as that sounds.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of Cobain ever saying this. One of Nirvana\u2019s former managers, Danny Goldberg, wrote in 2018 that the quote is a \u201cgrotesque perversion of Kurt\u2019s beliefs.\u201d\n\nAs the 2016 presidential election ramped up, this Cobain quote began circulating on social media. Cobain, who died in 1994 by suicide, supposedly said this in 1993, though no further sourcing, such as a specific date, location or interview, was provided in the meme.\n\nA search by The Daily Caller did not return any evidence that Cobain said this in 1993 or any other year.\n\n\u201cAs one of Nirvana\u2019s managers when Kurt was alive, I know that the quote is not only made up but it is also a grotesque perversion of Kurt\u2019s beliefs,\u201d Goldberg wrote in a 2018 piece for The Nation.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Cobain supported Democratic politicians, according to Goldberg, including Governor Jerry Brown.\n\n\u201cI think all of us can be proud that Kurt\u2019s reputation as an authentic and moral voice was so enduring that propagandists still think it is worth trying to coopt,\u201d Goldberg wrote on the meme\u2019s attempt to promote Trump using Cobain\u2019s likeness.\n\nThere is no evidence of the quote appearing online before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn one interview with journalist Sergio Marchi, when asked about businessman Ross Perot running for president, Cobain said that he didn\u2019t trust him, but would be interested in seeing someone who is \u201cnot a professional politician, someone who does not follow the guidelines for being a certified politician.\u201d He did not name Trump.\n\nIn that same interview, Cobain said, \u201cRepublicans are the incarnation of Satan. I hate them. For me the word Republican is a bad word; when someone says Republican they are saying \u2018cheat.\u2019 It\u2019s the most offensive term you can say to someone.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
