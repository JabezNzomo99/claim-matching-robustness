But Lincoln experts say it is not an actual quote from the 16th US president, and is instead loosely based on remarks he made in 1838.\n\n\u201cAmerica will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves,\u201d says text accompanying an image of Lincoln -- president during the Civil War -- in a June 7, 2020 Facebook post.\n\nThe post implies that the protests, which were sparked by 46-year-old black man George Floyd\u2019s May 25 death at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer, are aimed at discrediting US President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats and their allies in the media have been devastated by their lack of success in taking down America\u2019s most resilient President. The recent violence and unrest in America is not an accident,\u201d the post says of the White House incumbent.\n\nOther posts attributing the quote to Lincoln appear here and here on Facebook, here and here on Instagram, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nBut it is not a real quote from Lincoln, who was assassinated in April 1865, just days after the surrender of Confederate general Robert E. Lee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a corruption of a quote Lincoln actually said in his Lyceum speech, which is\u2026 one of the first major speeches Lincoln gave,\u201d Christian McWhirter, Lincoln Historian at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, told AFP by phone.\n\nLincoln expert Harold Holzer agreed, saying by email that the US leader \u201cnever said this,\u201d though \u201cit\u2019s been widely attributed to him by everyone from the AOC group to Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe real quote from Lincoln\u2019s 1838 speech to the Young Men\u2019s Lyceum in Springfield, Illinois is thematically similar to the one attributed to him in the Facebook posts, but the wording is entirely different.\n\n\u201cAt what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide,\u201d Lincoln said in the speech.\n\nMichael Burlingame, who holds the Chancellor Naomi B. Lynn Distinguished Chair in Lincoln Studies at the University of Illinois Springfield, said the current popularity of citing Lincoln may be due to the fact that he was America\u2019s leader during the worst crisis in the country\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cIn an exceptionally stormy time, people may be drawn to a leader who steered the ship of state successfully through the nation's greatest storm,\u201d Burlingame told AFP by email.\n\nMcWhirter, meanwhile, said people write to inquire about Lincoln quotes several times a month, and that \u201cmore often than not, they\u2019re not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cLincoln\u2019s an authority, so people love to... credit things to him cause it gives it more weight,\u201d he said.\n\nAFP Fact Check previously debunked a series of quotes falsely attributed to George Washington, the first US president.", "lang": "en"}
