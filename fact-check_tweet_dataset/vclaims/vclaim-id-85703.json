The budget, which tops Trump\u2019s initial proposal, includes funding for new equipment and strengthened nuclear defenses.\n\nBut there are a few major technicalities. First, the Budget Control Act, a bipartisan plan to decrease the federal deficit, caps the military\u2019s base budget until 2021, and the Senate bill exceeds the BCA limits. Below is a table from an April report on the defense budget from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service outlining the limits. In fiscal 2018, the base budget is capped at $549 billion, $64 billion less than the Senate bill.\n\nSecond, defense spending, like all discretionary spending, is officially authorized each year by the Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate. Members of the House are scrambling to come up with a spending plan to avoid a government shutdown, and raising the BCA caps is one of the issues being hashed out. Without a change to the spending caps, and without approval of the appropriations committee, the authorization bill is merely a strong suggestion for the military budget. (Essentially, the authorization bill is the Christmas wish-list but the Appropriations Committees are Santa Claus.)\n\nRepublican leaders and military advocates have criticized the BCA limits, arguing the caps threaten U.S. national security. Since the November 2016 election, \u201ccalls to remove or raise the limits on defense spending have greatly intensified,\u201d according to a Congressional Research Service report on the budget limits, commonly known as \u201csequestration.\u201d With this claim, Trump builds upon these criticisms by suggesting the military budget has been cut to the point of depletion.\n\nBut his claim is both an exaggeration and an oversimplification. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Department of Defense\u2019s base budget grew by 31 percent between fiscal 2000 and 2014, with an annual average growth rate of 1.9 percent. The growth is a reflection of the fact the U.S. military entered two wars during that time period: The war in Afghanistan in 2001 and the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nIn 2010, the total defense budget peaked at $774 billion in 2017 dollars. The total budget is made up of the base budget, which covers the military\u2019s regular operations, and funding for overseas contingency operations, which covers war-related activities. From 2000 to 2010 the total budget increased, a result of increases in both the base budget and OCO spending.\n\nBy 2016, when both wars had come to an end, the total budget was scaled back 23 percent to $595 billion. Despite the decrease, the total budget is still larger than it was in 2000 before the start of both wars.\n\nIn October 2011, then-President Barack Obama ended the war in Iraq. Four years later, in 2014, he brought an end to combat in Afghanistan. The end of combat usually results in a budget reduction, said Gordon Adams, who formerly served as associate director for national security and international affairs in the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nTo put the budget in a broader context: Even with the budget reductions, in 2016, the United States accounted for 36 percent of the total world military expenditure, according to an analysis by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an international organization dedicated to research into conflict. In 2016, U.S. spending was nearly three times more than the world\u2019s second-biggest military spender, China.\n\nTrump claims the military has been depleted due to years of budget cuts, while bragging to members of the Coast Guard that the days of a lean military are over. With this claim, Trump glosses over important military milestones and reveals he appears to have little understanding of the federal budget process.\n\nYes, Congress passed a bill authorizing nearly $700 billion to the military, but the appropriations committees have the ultimate say in how much gets spent. Moreover, because of the BCA caps on discretionary spending, the Senate\u2019s bill can\u2019t be implemented as is.\n\nWith respect to Trump\u2019s \u201ccuts,\u201d the decreased military budget reflects the close of two wars: the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. Despite the decreased budget, the total budget is still larger than it was in 2000, before either war began.", "lang": "en"}
