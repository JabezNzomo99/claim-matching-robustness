It comes from a popular 2005 rap song.\n\nSNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, are vouchers that low income Americans can use to buy food at approved retailers. States run and administer the program, while the federal government funds the benefits, according to the USDA website.\n\nA viral image falsely alleges in a post that people can call the telephone number 281-330-8004 to receive emergency food stamps, despite the number appearing nowhere on the USDA\u2019s directory of local SNAP offices. Nor does it match that of the USDA\u2019s National Hunger Hotline.
