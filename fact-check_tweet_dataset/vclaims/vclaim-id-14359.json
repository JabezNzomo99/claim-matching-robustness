In the first picture, she is wearing Hindu prayer beads while in the second, she is seen purportedly sporting a Christian cross.\n\nThe images are massively widespread on Facebook.\n\nLast year, Gandhi met the family of the Hathras victim on October 3 after several confrontations with Uttar Pradesh police. Gandhi, along with her brother and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, had sought the resignation of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over the alleged rape of a Dalit woman and the state government\u2019s handling of the case.\n\nA few social media users had shared the same images of Gandhi in 2020.\n\nIt was being claimed that the first picture was shot in Ayodhya and the other was taken in Kerala.\n\nThis was also viral in 2019 with the claim, \u201c\u091c\u0928\u0947\u090a\u0927\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0926\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092f \u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0923 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u0928\u0947\u090a\u0927\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u0939\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u0917\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u0947 \u092e\u0902\u0917\u0932\u0938\u0942\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u0915\u094d\u0930\u0949\u0938 \u0932\u091f\u0915\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0906 \u0939\u0948, \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u092e\u0947 \u0917\u0902\u0917\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u0947\u091f\u0940 \u0939\u0942\u0902, \u090f\u0915 \u0928\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u092b\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0940 \u091a\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0947\u0932 \u092a\u0947 \u0930\u0939\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u092b\u0948\u092e\u093f\u0932\u0940! (Janeudhari sister of janeudhari dattatrey Brahmin sports a cross on her neck instead of mangalsutra, and she says i am the daughter of Ganga, this is a family that has looted and is out on bail.)\u201d\n\nThe same photograph of Priyanka Gandhi was shared two years ago implying that she is actually a Christian and is simply masquerading as a Hindu.\n\nOne of the groups where the claim was shared was WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI.\n\nThe Congress leader\u2019s photograph has been morphed. Upon reverse searching the image on Google, the original photograph can be accessed. The video posted below illustrates how the image was fact-checked.\n\nIt has been carried by multiple media organisations including ABP News, The Statesman and Republic TV. While Republic TV has credited the photo to PTI, according to ABP News and The Statesman, the source of the image is AFP. The photograph was published by news outlets in January and February 2019 after Priyanka Gandhi had officially announced her entry into politics, taking charge of Eastern UP.\n\nAlt News found that the image dates back to February 2017. Posted by The National, the description below the image says, \u201cPriyanka Gandhi arrives at a Congress party rally in Rae Bareli district on February 17, 2017, during campaigning for Uttar Pradesh state elections. Sanjay Kanojia / AFP\u201d.\n\nPosted below is another image taken at the same gathering.\n\nIt is clear from the above image that Priyanka Gandhi is wearing a pendant and not a cross. The two photos \u2013 original and photoshopped \u2013 have been juxtaposed and posted below for comparison.\n\nIt may be reiterated that the photo of Priyanka Gandhi wearing a cross is photoshopped.", "lang": "en"}
