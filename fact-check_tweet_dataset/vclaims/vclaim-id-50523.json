E.U. officials said they had received no heads-up about the pending announcement.\n\n\u201cThe Coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,\u201d read a statement co-signed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel. \u201cThe European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.\u201d\n\nBeyond the unverifiable claim about his administration\u2019s efforts, there is no such thing as a \u201cforeign virus.\u201d Viruses can emerge anywhere on Earth. The Spanish Flu that emerged in 1918, killing 20 million to 50 million people, is believed to have started in the United States \u2014 the first case was reported there \u2014 though no one knows for sure, except that it almost certainly did not start in Spain.\n\nThe United States has lagged far behind other major countries in providing tests for possible cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially distributed flawed tests to state and local health departments. The lack of tests in the United States, compared with countries such as South Korea that have tested tens of thousands of people, has meant the possible spread of the virus in the country may not be fully known.\n\nOnce a country reaches 100 cases, the number of cases appears to increase 33 percent a day. The United States reached the threshold a little later than some European countries but appears to be following the same trajectory. Moreover, inadequate testing may be obscuring the number of cases in the United States.\n\nTrump speaks broadly about the E.U., but Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe, on Jan. 31 imposed a ban on flights to and from China, including Hong Kong and Macao, and Taiwan. That was three days before the United States imposed a similar ban on flights to and from China \u2014 though the U.S. ban did not include Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.\n\nAnthony Fauci, head of the infectious-diseases division at the National Institutes of Health, backed up Trump\u2019s claim Thursday morning and said the travel restrictions would help contain the virus. \u201cMost of the new infections that we\u2019re getting right now, the majority of them are coming from Europe,\u201d Fauci said.\n\n\u201cSome White House officials focused on public communications have tried to argue to outside experts that a portion of the cases across the country are from people who recently traveled to Europe \u2014 another epicenter of the outbreak \u2014 and less so from the spread between individuals in U.S. communities,\u201d The Washington Post reported. \u201cOne outside public health expert said he was skeptical of the administration spin but understood the goal was to sell the public on the idea that the virus numbers are not spreading as fast as some fear.\u201d\n\nThe White House later acknowledged this statement was wrong. The restrictions were limited to the Schengen Area, not all of Europe. For instance, countries where Trump owns golf courses, such as Ireland, Scotland, Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania, are not part of the Schengen Area.\n\n\u201cThere will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval.\u201d\n\nThis appears to be a reference to what Trump falsely claimed previously was a regulation imposed by the Obama administration. He earned Four Pinocchios for that claim. There was no Obama rule, and the steps taken by Trump to try to speed up testing could have been taken sooner.", "lang": "en"}
