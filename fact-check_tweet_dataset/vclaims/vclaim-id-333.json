This video is misleadingly edited.\n\nIn the video clip (here), West appears to say: \u201cThis is going to be radical, what I am about to say, but what we are not realising is: everybody goes home into lockdown in six months from now.\u201d\n\nThe interviewer then asks: \u201cWhen was that, approximately?\u201d\n\nThe Facebook video is made up of several short sequences from an interview conducted with West in October, 2019, by presenter Zane Lowe (here). It is heavily-edited; Kanye\u2019s words have been taken out of context.\n\nIn the original interview, when West says \u201cthis is going to be radical\u201d (at video timecode 26:10), he is actually talking about asking staff not to have pre-marital sex whilst working on his album \u201cJesus is King\u201d. He is not talking about an impending lockdown.\n\nThe comment \u201ceverybody goes home into lockdown in six months from now\u201d in the Facebook video is stitched together using different phrases from the original interview. For example, the actual context of \u201ceverybody goes home\u201d is \u201ceverybody goes home to their families and they want their sons and their daughters to be as successful as them.\" (here timecode 42:31) West is not in vision during this sentence in the Facebook video, which would enable the edits.\n\nIn the doctored video, when the interviewer asks West for a reason for the lockdown, his reply is \u201cChina\u201d. In the original clip he is actually discussing bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. from the Asian country (here timecode 10.20).\n\nWhen West references \u201cApril\u201d, he is talking about his spiritual journey and becoming a born-again Christian (here timecode 7.42).\n\nFalse. The social media clip is heavily-edited from an interview posted in October 2019, in which the musician talks about his forthcoming album, being a born-again Christian and his future plans. He does not predict a lockdown during the nearly two-hour interview.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
