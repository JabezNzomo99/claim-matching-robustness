The quote originated on a satirical website.\n\nThe article, titled \u201cMichelle Obama to Oprah: Trump is Dumbest President in U.S. History,\u201d was published on the website SCE News on April 1. It alleges Obama spoke critically of Trump in an interview with television personality Oprah Winfrey that was subsequently \u201cleaked to the press.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is hands down the dumbest president in United States history,\u201d the article quotes the former first lady as saying. \u201cHe literally has the IQ of a grilled cheese sandwich. Minus the cheese, which rather obviously has been slipping off the proverbial cracker for quite some time now.\u201d\n\nHad the former first lady actually made such comments, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on it. Obama also did not express any sentiment to that effect on her social media accounts, nor did Trump come up at any point in her most recent interview with Winfrey on Feb. 8.\n\nSuch a comment from Obama would likely prompt a statement \u2013 or at least a tweet \u2013 from Trump as well.

However, it deceptively leaves out the disclaimer at the bottom of Newsrapter\u2019s article that states, \u201cIt should come as no surprise to anyone except a tater that, while everything written in this article is certainly quite plausible, if not probable, none of it actually happened.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
