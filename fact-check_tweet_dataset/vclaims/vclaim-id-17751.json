But why is it that it is still not clear to Hindus how important Modi is to India.'\n\nScreenshot of the video being shared on Facebook with a Telugu caption.\n\nThe video is also being shared as, 'Why Pakistanis are celebrating Congress victory in 3 states...By taking modi's funeral..'\n\nIn the video one can hear the crowds chant, 'Mar gaya Modi, hai hai! Mar gaya Khattar, hai, hai!. Jor se roh lo, saare roh lo.' (Modi is dead, Khattar is dead, cry loudly, everybody cry)\n\nHowever, if you watch the video carefully no one appears to be sloganeering.\n\nBOOM did a text search for 'modi mock funeral' and found that the video dates back to 2017 at least.\n\nA YouTube video posted on January 25, 2017 shows that the audio of the Facebook video is different and does not contain the Hindi slogans heard in the other video. This is also the oldest video we could find online so far.\n\nWe also took a screenshot of the video and ran a reverse image search. A similar image appears on the website Digital Yuva and says the protest was in Tamil Nadu related to Jallikattu, an annual bull taming festival in the state. (Read more about the protests here)\n\nFurthermore the same video has also been shared in 2017 and 2018 as small businessmen in Haryana protesting against the Goods Service Tax in the state.\n\nWHERE IS THE VIDEO FROM?\n\nThe video appears to be from Tamil Nadu and related to Jallikattu protests. Earliest instances of the video online begin during January 2017 which coincides with wide scale protests in Tamil Nadu around the same time.\n\nThe photograph of the prime minister used on the effigy is the same that was widely used by pro Jallikattu protesters.\n\nIn addition, two onlookers in the video can be seen wearing a black lungi, traditionally worn by followers of Periyar and Ayyappa devotees.\n\nBetween 49 and 50 seconds into the video, a white poster with a red bull can be faintly seen.\n\nFinally at 33 seconds, you can hear someone say in Tamil 'Ayyo Poittaaare' or 'alas, he is dead'.\n\nBOOM was not able to find any credible news reports on the video however, we can say with reasonable certainty the video was not shot in Pakistan and it is not recent.", "lang": "en"}
