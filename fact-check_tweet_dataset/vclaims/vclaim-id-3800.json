The last government significantly reduced the availability of legal aid, saying that it needs to reduce the cost of the scheme. Lawyers complain that access to the justice system is under threat.\n\nIn 2014 academics from the University of Surrey looked into the \"business case\" for legal aid, and advice services more generally.\n\nAll the UK studies they found agreed that legal aid saves the government and the economy money, but the researchers noted their \"concerns over the quality of the data and methodologies adopted\". They concluded that the evidence was \"generally poor quality\" and that further research would be helpful.\n\nSavings of \u00a36 for every \u00a31 spent?\n\nA claim to this effect was made last year by the trade union Unite and Goldsmiths University.\n\nTheir report on legal aid says that \"for every \u00a31 spent on legal advice and aid, the state saves around \u00a36 on other forms of spending, such as families becoming homeless and children being taken into care\".\n\nThis isn't an original research finding. The statistic is from the Legal Action Group, a charity promoting access to justice.\n\nIn 2011 it said that \u00a349 million of cut spending on legal aid would end up costing \u00a3286 million elsewhere. That's roughly \u00a36 that would have been saved for every \u00a31 spent, according to the charity's director.\n\nThis is calculated by using older research from Citizens Advice on how much is saved by spending on different kinds of legal aid.\n\nFor example, Citizens Advice had said that for every \u00a31 spent on legal advice in employment problems, \u00a37.13 is saved. Legal Action Group calculated that if \u00a34 million of legal aid for employment law is cut, the lost savings are therefore \u00a328.5 million.\n\nThis is repeated in other areas of law\u2014housing, debt and welfare benefits\u2014to get the overall 1:6 ratio. It's only really relevant to a particular set of spending cuts in 2008/09.\n\nThe original Citizens Advice paper from 2010 goes into a lot of detail in its attempt to put exact figures on the costs and benefits of legal aid.\n\nIt uses older research again to estimate how legal issues lead to people having problems with the likes of debt and housing, and how much those problems end up costing the state. That figure can be compared to the cost of providing legal aid.\n\nThere are uncertainties to this exercise. For example, the paper acknowledges that it's \"impossible\" to assume that that legal aid will always prevent costly problems, although there is evidence that it helps.\n\nSo a simple claim like \"for every \u00a31 spent on legal aid the state saves \u00a36\" turns out to have evolved down a chain of different research findings, all with their own assumptions. It seems sensible to be cautious about it.", "lang": "en"}
