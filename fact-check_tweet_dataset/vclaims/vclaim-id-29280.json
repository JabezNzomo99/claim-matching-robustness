To read the others, click here.\n\nEl Paso Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, who announced Thursday that he is running for president, had been teasing a presidential bid for weeks.\n\nSpeculation about his intentions prompted the conservative Club for Growth to release a television ad looking to weaken enthusiasm for O\u2019Rourke among Democratic primary voters.\n\nThe ad argues that O\u2019Rourke has coasted through life due to \"white male privilege\" and that he is a far cry from former President Barack Obama, as many have drawn comparisons between the two Democrats.\n\n\"Obama went on to become the first African American editor of the Harvard Law Review, breaking barriers,\" the ad says. \"Beto crashed into them, causing a collision while driving drunk, then fleeing the scene to avoid accountability.\"\n\nClub for Growth provided a fact sheet detailing the source for each statement in the advertisement. Sources include newspaper articles and other sources online. O\u2019Rourke did not return a request for comment.\n\nOUR PROCESS: Read how PolitiFact checks everyone.\n\nWe looked at this incident in September last year and earlier, after allegations about his 1998 arrest were made during his 2018 Senate campaign and his 2012 congressional campaign.\n\nHere are the facts: O\u2019Rourke was arrested in 1998 for driving while intoxicated in Anthony, a small town in El Paso County.\n\nA witness told police officers that they saw O\u2019Rourke driving at a high speed on I-10 before losing control of his car and striking a truck traveling in the same direction, according to a police report of the incident published by the Houston Chronicle. The truck was sent across the center median and into the lane moving in the opposite direction.\n\nO\u2019Rourke then attempted to drive away, but the witness stopped him. Law enforcement arrived at the scene and arrested O\u2019Rourke. Police reported that O\u2019Rourke recorded a 0.136 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time.\n\nClub for Growth said O\u2019Rourke crashed into barriers, \"causing a collision while driving drunk, then fleeing the scene to avoid accountability.\"\n\nA police report of the incident states that O\u2019Rourke crashed into another car while driving under the influence of alcohol. A witness said he attempted to flee the scene, but was unsuccessful.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is one of four fact-checks featuring a claim made in Club for Growth\u2019s TV ad about Beto O\u2019Rourke.
