It\u2019s a claim the government has made in various forms before.\n\nWe\u2019ve done our own estimates based on figures for last year in the English NHS, and this claim seems to be in the right ballpark.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the Department of Health how the figure is calculated.\n\nThere are two ways to measure the delays to hospitals and patients caused by discharges.\n\nBased on everything the government has said it seems to be referring to the 10% of local authorities with the lowest number of delayed bed days attributed to social care and the 10% with the most.\n\nFigures are available which give the average daily rate of delayed transfers of care from hospital per 100,000 people over 18 in each council area.\n\nUsing this measure the 10% of councils with the least delayed bed days had a rate of 0.5 delays per 100,000. The 10% of councils with the most delays had a rate of 11.3 delays per 100,000. That\u2019s a difference of around 22 times.\n\nFor this year and using this measure, the government\u2019s figure is roughly correct.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund, a health think tank, has said that an increase in the number of delayed discharges from hospital since last year is \u201cundoubtedly driven\u201d by pressures in the NHS and social care.\n\nThe most common reason for a delayed discharge so far in 2016/17 has been that patients were waiting for a care package at home. This was closely followed by waiting for other non-acute NHS care, waiting for an assessment to be completed and waiting for a place in a nursing home.\n\nDepending on the reason for the delay and whether the patient was receiving acute or non-acute care there is some variation in whether the NHS, social care, or both are considered responsible for the delay. Looking at all delays together, the NHS is responsible for the most.", "lang": "en"}
