No, that's not true: The product is not real. There is no such system to weigh down a child's ankles to prevent them from running away. It is a prank - an empty box that can be used for gag gifts.\n\nThe claim originated from a meme (archived here) published by FAIL Blog on November 15, 2018. It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe humorous post has gotten tens of thousands of shares and engagements on social media, but the product is not real. A link to an eBay listing for one of the boxes offered this description:\n\nThis is a fake empty box used for joke gifts. You only get an empty box. There is no such thing as \"Toddler Tamers\" Just put something heavy inside the box, like a rock or a book. Then give the \"gift\" and watch your friend pretend to like it when they clearly don't.\n\nThe fake product is currently listed on the auction site for $12, which will give the winner an empty box and the eventual gift recipient, perhaps, a few laughs.", "lang": "en"}
