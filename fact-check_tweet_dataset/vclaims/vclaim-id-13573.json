Here is a fact check of this claim.\n\nWhat is MSP?\n\n The Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) since 1985, earlier named as Agricultural Prices Commission) came into existence in January 1965. The 2017-18 annual report of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare states that, \u2018CACP was set up with a view to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure, and is mandated to advise on the price policy (MSP) of 23 crops. These include seven cereal crops (paddy, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi and barley), five pulse crops (gram, tur, moong, urad and lentil), seven oilseeds (groundnut, sunflower seed, soybean, rapeseed-mustard, safflower, nigerseed and sesamum), copra (dried coconut), cotton, raw jute and sugarcane.\u2019\n\nIn order to understand the MSP better, it is important to know the determinants of it. The same annual report also states that, \u2018Cost of production (CoP) is one of the important factors in the determination of MSP of mandated crops. Besides cost, the Commission considers other important factors such as demand and supply, price trends in the domestic and international markets, intercrop price parity and terms of trade between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, the likely impact of MSPs on consumers, in addition to ensuring rational utilization of land, water and other production resources.\u2019 Thus, pricing policy i.e. the exercise of MSP is not based on cost only though cost is an important determinant of MSP.

The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Wheat has been more than doubled, from Rs 640 per quintal in 2004-05 to Rs 1,285 in 2011-12. Similarly, the MSP for Paddy has been increased from Rs 560 in 2003-04 to Rs 1250 per quintal in 2011-12.\u2019\n\nThe Directorate of Economics and Statistics & Reserve Bank of India\u2019s handbook of statistics have data related to the MSP of various crops over the years. The Open Government Data (OGD) platform of the government also has the MSP for the years between 2003 and 2012.\n\nIt can be seen from the data that the MSP for wheat did increase from Rs. 640 per quintal in 2004-05 to Rs.1285 per quintal in 2011-12. By the end of UPA\u2019s second term in 2013-14, the MSP for wheat was Rs. 1400 per quintal. During the current government, the MSP for wheat increased from Rs.1450 per quintal in 2014-15 to Rs. 1840 per quintal in 2018-19.\n\nIn the case of paddy, MSP in 2003-04 was Rs. 550 and it increased to Rs. 1080 in 2011-12 where as the numbers in the claim correspond to 2004-05 & 2012-13. The MSP for Paddy increased to Rs. 1310 per quintal by the end of UPA\u2019s term. In the of the current government, the MSP for paddy increased from Rs. 1360 per quintal in 2014-15 to Rs. 1750 per quintal in 2018-19. It has to be noted that these prices correspond to Paddy (Common) and not grade \u2018A\u2019 paddy. If the percentage increase in MSP during various governments is considered, MSP for both paddy (common) & wheat increased by more than 60% during UPA\u2019s first term. During UPA\u2019s second term, the MSP for paddy increased by only 25% and by 27% in the case of wheat. The current NDA government increased the MSP for paddy by close to 29% and by 27% in the case of wheat.\n\nClaim: The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Wheat has been more than doubled, from Rs 640 per quintal in 2004-05 to Rs 1,285 in 2011-12. Similarly, the MSP for Paddy has been increased from Rs 560 in 2003-04 to Rs 1250 per quintal in 2011-12. Fact: While these numbers are TRUE, it has to be noted that MSP increased by the greatest percentage during UPA 1. The current NDA government did better than UPA 2 in the case of MSP for paddy while it increased the MSP of wheat by more or less the same percent as UPA 2.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
