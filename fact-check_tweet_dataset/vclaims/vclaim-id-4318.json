At those times the Ministry of Defence (MoD) provided little supporting evidence to explain the figure, and the Commons Defence Committee said in 2011 it couldn\u2019t verify the statement based on the limited information it was given from the government.\n\nWe got in touch again with the Ministry of Defence who directed us to the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, which is where the figure first surfaced. It wasn\u2019t aware of any further updates to the figure since we last looked at the issue.\n\nWhat we know now\n\nThe \u2018black hole\u2019 is a funding gap, here covering a 10 year period. It broadly refers to the difference between what the MoD thinks it will need to fund in future and its actual budget\u2014assuming the budget only rises in line with inflation.\n\nSo to close a funding gap, the government has to either increase the budget beyond inflation year-on-year, or make savings.\n\nIt\u2019s not a very precise figure either. Estimating your future costs is difficult. Defence budgets have to take into account things like changes in fuel price and exchange rates, which tend to be volatile. The pound dropped significantly against the US dollar following the EU referendum in 2016, for example, which couldn\u2019t have been predicted back in 2010.\n\nThe government published a breakdown of the claimed \u00a338 billion gap: \u00a320.5 billion was down to equipment procurement and support and the rest on \u201cother pressures\u201d such as the costs of employing service personnel.\n\nBut these figures differed markedly from estimates produced by the National Audit Office (NAO) at the time, putting the funding gap at \u00a36 billion over the decade.\n\nSo what\u2019s happened to the \u2018gap\u2019 since then?\n\nThere\u2019s no equivalent estimate for the size of the current gap overall\u2014instead the National Audit Office has published a series of reports looking at funding pressures in different parts of the defence budget like equipment, estates and personnel.\n\nAt the start of 2018 it found\u2014based on figures agreed with the Ministry of Defence\u2014that the government\u2019s 10-year plan for defence equipment wasn\u2019t affordable. \u201cAt present the affordability gap ranges from a minimum of \u00a34.9bn to \u00a320.8bn if financial risks materialise and ambitious savings are not achieved.\u201d\n\nThe MoD disputes the NAO\u2019s interpretation of the gap, saying the higher end of the estimate is unrealistic and that it expects to make efficiency savings to help deal with it.\n\nThe NAO has also identified funding gaps in other parts of the defence budget: \u201cOur past work has identified an \u00a38.5 billion funding gap for managing the Department\u2019s estate. Also, the Department faces challenges in managing its staff budget.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
