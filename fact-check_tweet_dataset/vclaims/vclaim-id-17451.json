The man was beaten up for entering a mosque, the claim furthers. A Twitter user @shailen_pratapshared the video saying, \u201c\u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u090f\u0915 \u0926\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0915\u094b \u092e\u0938\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0926 \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0902\u0926\u0930 \u0916\u0940\u0902\u091a \u0915\u0930 \u0932\u0947 \u0917\u090f \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u093e\u0930-\u092e\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930 \u0905\u0927\u092e\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0964 MobLynching (A Dalit was dragged into a mosque in Uttar Pradesh and brutally thrashed. #MobLynching.)\u201d\n\n@shailen_pratap is followed by the top brass of the Bharatiya Janata Party \u2013 union home minister Amit Shah and union commerce and railway minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s office. He is also followed by Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga. His tweet drew nearly 2,000 retweets and was viewed over 16,000 times. His tweet was quote-tweeted by journalist Abhijit Iyer Mitra.\n\nA Twitter user @RituRathaur also quote-tweeted @shailen_pratap\u2019s tweet and wrote, \u201cMob Drags one dalit Hindu insidea mosque & almost lynch him to death\u201d. She is also followed by top BJP leaders \u2013 union ministers Giriraj Singh and Piyush Goyal\u2019s office.\n\nThe video is also circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\nA keyword search redirected Alt News to news reports by Dainik Bhaskar, Punjab Kesari and Patrika which said that the man was beaten up by a mob on the allegation of stealing a mobile phone. The incident had occurred in UP\u2019s Harpur district. According to Dainik Bhaskar, he was taken hostage by a mob when he had gone to pray namaz and beaten for more than an hour. A complaint was filed by his brother Akhlaq.\n\nIf one carefully listens, at about 17 seconds into the video someone can be heard saying, \u201cDo mobile nikal liya tha (He had stolen two mobile phones.)\u201d\n\nHarpur police had tweeted that the incident had taken place on May 29 and a case was registered in Harpur Nagar police station against those who were beating up the man. An English translation of the police statement says \u2013 \u201cThe above case is of May 29, 2019 where the Harpur Nagar police station has started proceedings against three accused under Section 151 of CrPC act, NCR no. 278/19 section:323/504 on the basis of the written complaint filed by the victim\u2019s brother on 02.06.2019. Legal proceedings have started.\u201d\n\nAlt News contacted Harpur Nagar police station and were informed by the SHO that both the victim and the perpetrators hailed from the same community. \u201cHe was beaten on the suspicion of mobile theft. Three people were arrested,\u201d SHO Mahavir Singh told Alt News.\n\nIn conclusion, a mob of Muslim men did brutally thrash a man inside a mosque. However, the claims that the victim was a Dalit and that he was beaten up for entering the place of worship are false. As clarified by the police both the victim and the perpetrators are of the same community and the victim was thrashed on the suspicion of mobile theft.\n\nRecently, several incidents were found to be shared on social media with a communal narrative. Stone-pelting at a mosque in Jaipur was falsely circulated as members of the Muslim community attacking a temple in Haryana. A video of sexual molestation in UP was also falsely ascribed to members of the Muslim community. An assault on a tribal woman from MP was shared on social media with multiple false, communal narratives.", "lang": "en"}
