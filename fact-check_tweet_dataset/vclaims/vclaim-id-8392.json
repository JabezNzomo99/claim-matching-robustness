But this money comes from the block grant from the UK Treasury, rather than from England specifically. An increasing proportion of the Scottish government\u2019s budget also comes from taxes it raises.\n\nIn Scotland, just under \u00a311,000 was spent per person in 2016/17 and in England it was just under \u00a39,000.\n\nThis uses a measure of spending called \u2018identifiable expenditure\u2019, which is money that the government can say was definitely spent in that region or country. This includes all kinds of services, from health to transport, and covers money spent by the UK and devolved governments as well as local councils and public corporations.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look at the \u2018non-identifiable spending\u2019, which is spending that can\u2019t be associated with one part of the UK in particular, like national defence.\n\nThe Scottish government says there are a number of reasons why spending in Scotland is higher.\n\nFor example, people live further apart in Scotland\u2014the population density is lower\u2014so services cost more to provide.\n\nAlso, the spending needs of each country aren\u2019t the same. Some services like water and sewage are in the public sector in Scotland whereas in the rest of the UK they\u2019re in the private sector. There\u2019s also a greater need for health and housing services than the rest of the UK.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at all this in more detail here.\n\nScotland, along with the other devolved countries of the UK, receives a block grant from the UK government. This amounted to around \u00a325 billion in 2016/17 after adjustments have taken place. The UK government is responsible for collecting some, but not all taxes in Scotland.\n\nAround 8% of all taxes collected by HMRC in 2016/17 came from Scotland. That amounted to just under \u00a344 billion. 37% of all public sector spending in Scotland was undertaken by the UK government in 2016/17. We\u2019ve looked more at taxation and spending in Scotland here.\n\nAny changes in the amount of this block grant from the Treasury are calculated each year using the Barnett formula.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only place that money for spending on Scotland comes from though. Tax powers have been increasingly devolved to the Scottish parliament, particularly since 2016, which has reduced the proportion of the Scottish budget made up by the block grant.\n\nHow does the Barnett formula work?\n\nThe Barnett formula aims to make changes to funding for services in England have the same pound-per-person effect on the money which goes to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for those services.\n\nIt\u2019s not set out in law, and in practice the Treasury decides how to apply it. It can also be bypassed if the Treasury decides certain spending is outside the formula. If the devolved governments disagree they can argue the case.\n\nThe formula itself is basically: any change to UK government department budget, multiplied by the percentage of devolved services in that area, multiplied by the percentage population in that country.", "lang": "en"}
