Furthermore, Lennon died in 1980, while the image claims he made this statement in 1981.\n\nWhile musicians and celebrities often wade into politics, this quote does not come from the late Beatle, who was assassinated in New York City on Dec. 8, 1980.\n\n\u201cI honestly beleive [sic] that the only way we are going to get ourselves out of the messes we\u2019ve created for ourselves is to find strong and independent leaders,\u201d the image claims Lennon said in 1981. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a revolution. Electing someone that isn\u2019t a politician is the only way. Perhaps a business man.\u201d\n\nA search of interviews and other sources online returned no such instance of Lennon calling for a business man to be elected.
