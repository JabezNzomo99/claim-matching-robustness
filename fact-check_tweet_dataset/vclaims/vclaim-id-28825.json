Described as a \u201cpopulist firebrand,\u201d he directed his ire at so-called \u201cglobalists\u201d and cast figures like former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as members of a \u201ccorrupt elite.\u201d\n\nThe National Liberty Federation has a history of spreading misinformation through its memes, with this post alleging that Bannon once predicted jail time for members of the Obama administration. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if by the end of President Trump\u2019s first term you see multiple people from Barack Obama\u2019s administration, if not he himself, in Federal prison,\u201d it quotes him as saying.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Bannon ever made this statement. Though the quote has been circulating online since at least 2017, an internet search revealed no credible sources linking it to him.\n\nBannon and the White House parted ways in August 2017, seven months into the Trump administration.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
