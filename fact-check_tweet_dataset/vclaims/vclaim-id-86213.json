Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) claimed in December that there are \u201cthousands of Americans who are dead each year because [of] the Democrats\u2019 refusal to secure our borders.\u201d President Trump claimed in 2018 that 63,000 Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which works out to about 3,700 a year.\n\nA 2018 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Criminology, led by Michael Light, a criminologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, examined whether places with higher percentages of undocumented immigrants have higher rates of violent crime such as murder or rape. The answer: States with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tended to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares in the years 1990 through 2014. Similar results were found in another peer-reviewed study by the same researchers that looked at nonviolent crime, such as drug arrests and driving under the influence (DUI) arrests.\n\nSimilarly, the libertarian Cato Institute in 2018 looked at 2015 criminal conviction data among undocumented immigrants in Texas \u2014 one of the few states to record whether a person who has been arrested is in the country illegally or not. Researcher Alex Nowrasteh found that criminal conviction and arrest rates in Texas for undocumented immigrants were lower than those of native-born Americans for homicide, sexual assault and larceny.\n\nSome advocates of restraining immigration have sought to make the case that undocumented immigrants commit more crimes by relying on data from the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), a federal program that offers states and localities some reimbursement for the cost of incarcerating certain criminal non-U. S. citizens. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) in July issued an updated report on SCAAP data, but GAO (and SCAAP) only counts total incarcerations, not individuals. Thus the numbers are not helpful for drawing conclusions about the criminality of undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn other words, the available research indicates that, when compared with U.S. citizens, illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes. But we understand that some people might argue that any crime committed by an illegal alien is one too many. Miller is involved in a counting exercise \u2014 thousands of deaths that in theory would not otherwise have happened if the undocumented immigrant had not set foot on U.S. soil.\n\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security Estimate of the Illegal Alien Population Residing in the United States in January 2015, there were 1.9 million illegal residents in Texas, or about 16 percent of the 12 million undocumented immigrants estimated by the agency nationwide. If one assumes that the homicide conviction rate is the same across the country \u2014 admittedly a big assumption \u2014 then that adds up to 1,250 homicide convictions over a five-year period, or 250 a year.\n\nThat slippery wording can be used to justify just about any American death from heroin. But while 90 percent of the heroin sold in the United States comes from Mexico, virtually all of it comes through legal points of entry. \u201cA small percentage of all heroin seized by [Customs and Border Protection] along the land border was between Ports of Entry (POEs),\u201d the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a 2018 report.\n\nMiller spoke vaguely about \u201cthreats crossing our southern border,\u201d adding: \u201cWe have families and communities that are left unprotected and undefended. We have international narco terrorist organizations.\u201d The clear implication, especially with the use of the word \u201cterrorist,\u201d was that people were being murdered. Adding drug deaths to the total is not justifiable given that Trump\u2019s proposed wall would not stem the flow of drugs.\n\nThere\u2019s a website of victims that says it\u2019s \u201cin honor of the thousands of American citizens killed each year by Illegal Aliens.\u201d There are entries as recently as January, but fewer than 300 people are listed even though entries date as far back as 1994. The anecdotal stories are moving, but one would expect a much longer list if thousands of people were really killed each year.\n\n\u201cStephen Miller\u2019s comment is 100 percent correct because, sadly, thousands die every year from threats crossing our Southern Border. In the last two years alone, ICE arrested criminal aliens charged or convicted of approximately 4,000 homicides (and those are only the offenders authorities could track down). Three hundred Americans die every week from heroin overdoses \u2013 90 percent of which enters from the Southern Border \u2013 and that horrific number doesn\u2019t even take into account deaths from cocaine, fentanyl and meth pouring across at record amounts. This is a dangerous and deadly situation that needlessly kills thousands of Americans every single year \u2013 and while the sad statistical truth may not aid the Washington Post\u2019s political agenda, the fact remains.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
