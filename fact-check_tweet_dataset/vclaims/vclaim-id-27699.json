The user used the disaster as an opportunity to post images of non-white people carrying boxes on sidewalks and across streets and claiming they were Floridians looting property as residents and business owners evacuated ahead of the storm.\n\nBut none of the images was taken during Dorian, nor were they taken in Florida or even taken in the same year as Dorian.\n\n The first photograph was taken in London in August 2011 during violence that erupted after police killed a black man; some people also blamed the violence on economic inequality and government-austerity measures. A Reuters photographer took the picture, which carried captions that said the people pictured were stealing from an electronics store.\n\nThe second photograph (bottom left) was taken almost three decades ago. According to the caption, it was taken in April 1992 during the Los Angeles riots, which resulted from the acquittal of four white police officers who were captured on video beating black motorist Rodney King. The caption on the photograph states that those pictured were taking stolen electronics in boxes across a street.\n\nThe final image appears to be a screen capture from a video taken by bystanders during Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in 2017. Although the purpose of the Facebook post appears to be to make it look like non-white people are predisposed to commit crimes of opportunity like looting, overall crime during Harvey actually dropped, according to Houston police Chief Art Acevedo.\n\nAcevedo told the local NPR station, \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that crime is always going to follow storms, and that is frankly \u2014 according to most research \u2014 not really true. In fact, what most researchers actually say is that there\u2019s this certain sense of goodwill and altruism in communities that actually helps deter violence and other crimes in the wake of these things.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
