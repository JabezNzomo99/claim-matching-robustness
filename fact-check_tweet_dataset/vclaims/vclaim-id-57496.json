Pl remember we share this planet with them (sic),\" he wrote.\n\nA herd of deer was seen lounging on the Ooty-Coimbatore road.\n\nThe photo is real but the claim with which it is being shared is not true.\n\nSearching google for the image led to a six-year-old photograph of Sika deer shot in Japan's Nara Park.\n\nIt was published along with an article on July 28, 2014 with the headline 'Nara's deer take over one of the city's streets' in Japan Today.\n\nAccording to the article, \"the first thing most people think of when they hear Nara is deer since over 1,000 of the animals live inside Nara Park. But even with roughly 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of space to run around in, sometimes the deer like to stray outside the park's boundaries, such as they do each July when they occupy this sidewalk and stretch of road.\"\n\nThe article mentions that on July 22, 2014, though, Twitter user Mojizuri was startled to see a herd of deer occupying a sidewalk, as well as spilling out into the road itself.\n\n\"I've lived here for 10 years, and I've never seen them do this sort of thing before!\" Mojizuri wrote.\n\nThe Sika deer are known to venture beyond the park's boundaries and wander into gift shops, restaurants and across the street.\n\nIn the full photo, a Japanese signboard can be seen.\n\nIn the viral photo, this Japanese signboard has been cropped out.\n\n\n\nMrinal Pande later tweeted that the image is not what it was claimed to be.\n\nThere's also a video which shows a herd of deer at that same location where the original photo was shot.\n\nThe image was actually shared as sarcasm, Netizens, however, fell for the prank and further propagated the false claim.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Nara City Tourism Association (NCTA), Unlike most deer in Japan, Nara's deer live unusually close to humans.\n\n\"Please exercise great caution when driving in the vicinity of Nara Park, as the deer are known to jump out suddenly,\" the association warns. This clearly indicates that the heard found on the road that day is not an unusual phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, the wildlife has not taken over the streets yet.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.\n\nAlso Read: Fact Check: Hantavirus In China, Next Outbreak On Door?", "lang": "en"}
