Why? Africa, wake up, we\u2019ve already had people dying from the trial vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a vulnerable group when it comes to getting jobs, access to jobs, getting better healthcare, getting better social housing. During this pandemic, most of us are cramped up in houses with more than four people in.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t find us as a vulnerable group then, but for the vaccination they do. They want us to be the first to have access to it. Wake up people, especially Africans \u2013 they\u2019re coming for you. Wake up, please.\u201d\n\nThe speaker makes a number of false claims, including about people dying after being administered with a COVID-19 vaccine. Such claims have been debunked by Reuters here and here).\n\nReuters has also debunked a claim that the United Nations planned to test vaccines in Africa (here).\n\nAs of mid-June, 2020, no vaccines against COVID-19 have been approved for use. There are currently 142 potential vaccines being developed around the world \u2013 13 of which have reached human trials. These trials are being carried out in China, Germany, Russia, UK and the US (here).\n\nHancock did not say vaccines would be trialled on BAME communities, but rather that people from ethnic minorities could be among several categories of at-risk people who should be protected first if a vaccine became available.\n\nAn official study published on June 2 said Black and Asian people in England were up to 50% more likely to die after being infected with COVID-19 (here).\n\nPartly false. BAME groups in the UK are being considered for priority vaccinations when one is approved for use, due to statistical evidence showing these communities are more at-risk from coronavirus. However, it is false to say the government is targeting these communities for trials of vaccines that have killed people.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
