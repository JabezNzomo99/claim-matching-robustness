Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the news in the post.\n\nFact: The girl in the photo is Athira/Ayesha, a Kerala girl who got converted into Islam two years back. She has no connection with Raja Singh. A similar claim which went viral on social media four years back was condemned by Raja Singh previously. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the girl\u2019s photo is cropped and ran through Google Reverse Image Search, a \u2018The News Minute\u2019 article with the same photo can be found in the search results. According to that article, the girl in the photo is Athira (aka Ayesha \u2013 converted name), who accepted Islam two years back in Kerala. She has no connection with the MLA Raja Singh.\n\nAlso, when searched on Google with the keywords \u2018Raja Singh sister accepted Islam\u2019, another \u2018The News Minute\u2019 article published four years back can be found in the search result. According to that article, in 2015, Raja Singh filed a defamation case against a newspaper which published that Raja Singh\u2019s niece accepted Islam without verifying the facts.\n\nThe image in the post shows that the news was published by \u2018The News Minute\u2019 on June 6th, 2019. But no such news was found on the The News Minute website.\n\nTo sum it up, a Kerala Hindu girl\u2019s conversion to Islam is being falsely shared as Raja Singh\u2019s sister conversion.\n\nUpdate: TNM has denied publishing any such article and has published a clarification on the spread of the fake post on their name.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
