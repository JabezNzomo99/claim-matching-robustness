Its rescue was not related to any wildfires.\n\nThe Amazon Rainforest has been impacted by a record number of forest fires in recent months, reports Newsweek. Mazeika Sullivan, an associate professor at Ohio State University\u2019s School of Environment and Natural Resources, told National Geographic that the wildfires have taken a \u201cmassive toll on wildlife in the short term.\u201d\n\nThe picture does not, however, depict an animal affected by these wildfires. A reverse image search reveals that it actually shows a jaguar swimming with a Brazilian soldier in the river near Manaus, the state capital of Amazonas. None Mangeira, a Brazilian photographer, took the picture in 2016, according to her Facebook page.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with the fires,\u201d Mangueira told the Associated Press in an interview.\n\nThe jaguar, named Jiquitaia, was adopted by the Brazilian army after hunters killed its mother, according to her. It was two years old at the time of the photograph, which was taken for a conservation project.\n\nThe image has been miscaptioned and used without permission previously, according to the Associated Press.", "lang": "en"}
