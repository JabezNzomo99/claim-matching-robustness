(Technically, this is known as \u201cannualized quarterly change\u201d or SAAR \u2014 seasonally adjusted at annual rate.) Trump gets his terminology wrong, using the phrase \u201cyearly basis,\u201d which could mean from the third quarter of 2015 to the the third quarter of 2016, in which case Obama easily exceeded 3 percent numerous times. On an annual basis, Obama\u2019s best year was 2015, when annual growth was 2.6 percent.\n\nTrump heaped praise on Reagan\u2019s Tax Reform Act of 1986, which simplified tax brackets and eliminated tax shelters; it also lowered the top individual tax rate to 28 percent but raised the capital gains rate to the same level, giving them parity. But this is a rather strange flip-flop because Trump always has been a fierce critic of the bill, blaming it repeatedly for the savings and loan crisis, a decline in real estate investing and the 1990-1991 recession.\n\n\u201cThis tax act was just an absolute catastrophe for the country, for the real estate industry, and I really hope that something can be done,\u201d Trump told Congress in 1991. In a television interview with Joan Rivers, he said: \u201cWhat caused the savings and loan crisis was the 1986 tax law change. It was a disaster. It took all of the incentives away from investors.\u201d\n\nTrump also frequently attacked one of the Democratic sponsors of the bill, Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), such as in a Wall Street Journal commentary in 1999. \u201cMr. Bradley\u2019s last big idea to be enacted into legislation was also one of the worst ideas in recent history,\u201d Trump wrote, saying Bradley was responsible for the elimination of a tax shelter for real estate investments. (He said the good parts of the bill could be attributed to Reagan.)\n\nThe United States certainly has one of the highest statutory corporate tax rates in the world, currently pegged as high as 39.1 percent when including state taxes. (The federal rate is 35 percent.) Trump says it is 60 percent higher than \u201cour economic competitors,\u201d comparing 39.1 percent to the average rate for the other members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which is 25.5 percent when not weighted for GDP. (It is 29.6 percent when weighted for GDP.)\n\nBut the official rate does not necessarily tell the whole story. What also matters is the actual tax a company pays, after deductions and tax benefits. That is known as the effective tax rate, which can be calculated differently depending on the survey. According to the Congressional Research Service, the effective rate for the United States is 27.1 percent, compared to an effective GDP-weighted average of 27.7 percent for the OECD. \u201cAlthough the U.S. statutory tax rate is higher, the average effective rate is about the same, and the marginal rate on new investment is only slightly higher,\u201d the CRS says.\n\nThere are no official, current numbers on the profits held overseas by U.S. companies, just estimates. The White House would not respond to a query on where Trump is getting these numbers, but his high-end figure appears to be an exaggeration. The Internal Revenue Service in 2012 said the figure was $2.3 trillion, and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it had risen to $2.6 trillion in 2015. There are other estimates as well, but none top $2.8 trillion, according to PolitiFact.", "lang": "en"}
