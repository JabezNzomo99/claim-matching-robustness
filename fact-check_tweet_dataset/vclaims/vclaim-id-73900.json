The product is on the FDA\u2019s searchable list of hand sanitizers that are either contaminated or potentially contaminated. The bottles of Born Basic Anti-Bac Hand Sanitizer 70% alcohol that were manufactured at the facility in Mexico were found to contain methanol.\n\nOn Aug. 13, 2020, the Born Basic brand published a press release detailing that steps have been taken by the company to remediate the issue:\n\nAside from issuing a voluntary recall on the affected products, the company halted production at the affected manufacturing facility in Mexico, hired a crisis management company to issue refunds to customers who bought recalled products, and reached out by email and social media to inform the public.\n\nA spokesperson for Born Basic said in an Aug. 16, 2020, email that hand sanitizer products currently on store shelves are safe.\n\nAccording to the FDA, \u201cSubstantial methanol exposure could result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death.\u201d\n\nStarting in June 2020, amid a buying frenzy of the products during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA warned the public to avoid a growing list of hand sanitizers that were contaminated with methanol.\n\nAs The Associated Press reported in July 2020, \u201cThe active ingredient that kills germs in legitimate sanitizers is ethyl alcohol, which is consumable. But some Mexican companies have been replacing it with poisonous methanol, or wood alcohol, which is used in antifreeze.\u201d\n\nAll Americans should practice good hand hygiene, which includes using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Unfortunately, there are some companies taking advantage of the increased usage of hand sanitizer during the coronavirus pandemic and putting lives at risk by selling products with dangerous and unacceptable ingredients. Consumers and health care providers should not use methanol-containing hand sanitizers.\n\nThe list of hand sanitizer brands the FDA is warning against has ballooned to more than 130 brands. Members of the public can search the FDA\u2019s database to see if the brand they own is on the list.", "lang": "en"}
