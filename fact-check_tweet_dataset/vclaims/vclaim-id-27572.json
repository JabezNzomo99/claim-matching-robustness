Some of them climb the bus and as the video ends, they detain a man.\n\nThe two video clips can be seen below.\n\nThere are several posts on Facebook and WhatsApp with different claims. An archived version of the post can be accessed here.\n\nBOOM ran a keywords search on Google and found an article by Nation Next, a local publication in Nagpur. The article cites Nagpur police saying the video is not from the city. We contacted the Nagpur district police and found the same. They had no information regarding any of these videos.\n\nWe found that the video was shot at Ahmednagar bus stand. The same was stated in the description of Nation Next's YouTube video.\n\n\"This was a mock drill, happened on September 3rd this month,\" Pawar told BOOM.\n\n\"There is no terrorist activity so far. We keep rehearsing the scenario each time when there are festivals,\" he further added.\n\n\"We included the police reserve from the district reserve force, district police, and the other district troops which are meant for handling these scenarios,\" he said.\n\nPawar also said that since it was the festive season police forces were being more vigilant.\n\nWhen questioned about whether local police had any input from central intelligence agencies about any terror threat, he denied the same and said: \"no inputs from any central agency, it's just a routine rehearsal.\"", "lang": "en"}
