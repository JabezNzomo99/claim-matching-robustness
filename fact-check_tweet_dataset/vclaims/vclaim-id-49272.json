Should such a vaccine be produced, whether children will be required to take it before returning to school is a decision that will be made at local levels and based on a variety of factors. No one can assert at this time with any reliability that all schoolchildren everywhere will have to be vaccinated to attend school again.\n\nThe notion that citizens will be subjected to compulsory, involuntary implantation with RFID chips (so the government can better track them) is an old conspiracy theory trope with no basis in fact. The specific claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is being used as a pretext to push a vaccine with a microchip capable of tracking Americans (along with the rest of the world\u2019s population) is one that we have already debunked at length.\n\n\u201cThe Bible says you will break out into boils.\u201d\n\nThe Bible does not say that humans will \u201cbreak out into boils\u201d as a result of COVID-19 vaccinations or RFID chips. The Bible is silent on both these subjects, as vaccination and RFID technologies were not developed until many centuries after the texts that comprise the Bible were written and compiled.\n\n\u201cMany kids will die from the COVID-19 vaccine. Just to remind you the 4 kids that took the vaccine, died immediately.\u201d\n\nAs no effective COVIO-19 yet exists, no one can say that \u201cmany kids\u201d will die from it, nor, obviously, that any children have already died from it. The latter rumor is also one we previously debunked at length here on Snopes.com", "lang": "en"}
