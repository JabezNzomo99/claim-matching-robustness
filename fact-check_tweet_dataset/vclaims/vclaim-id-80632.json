What we have found is we win when voter turnout is high, we lose when it is low. Next Tuesday, let us come out in large numbers. Let us have the highest voter turnout in Democratic primary history in New York.\"\n\nWe wondered whether it\u2019s accurate for Sanders to say he\u2019s won when turnout is high and lost when the turnout is low. We didn\u2019t find a unified source that presents 2016 Democratic primary turnout rates on a state-by-state basis, so we created measurements that address two different ways of measuring turnout. (Political scientists we contacted said our approach was solid.)\n\nThe bottom line is that we found a few cases where Sanders won high turnout states, but overall, the case he makes is pretty thin.\n\nTurnout rates in the 2016 primaries and caucuses\n\nLet's start with the first way of measuring turnout: How many people voted in the 2016 primaries and caucuses compared with 2012.\n\nTo do this, we divided by the number of Democratic ballots cast in the 2016 primaries and caucuses by the number of votes Barack Obama received in the 2012 general election (a reasonable approximation of how many Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters there are in each state). The higher this percentage, the higher the turnout. (We used data from the U.S. Elections Project, run by University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald, and NBC News.)\n\nAs the following chart shows, Sanders won the three highest-turnout contests, but also the 10 lowest-turnout contests. States won by Sanders are marked in bold.\n\nSo Sanders does have something of a point -- the top three slots are all states he won. Vermont is an outlier -- it\u2019s Sanders\u2019 home state -- but Oklahoma and New Hampshire are legitimate, high-turnout Sanders victories. Sanders won two other primary states with relatively high turnouts -- Michigan and Wisconsin. Hillary Clinton took the rest.\n\nBut Sanders' point holds as long as you only consider primaries and ignore caucuses.\n\nRemember those bottom 10 states that Sanders won? They were all caucuses, where the complicated process tends to keep voter turnout low. Ignoring the large number of low-turnout caucuses Sanders won would be cherry-picking.\n\nPutting these low-turnout caucuses into the calculation quickly weakens the link between high-turnout contests and Sanders victories: The average turnout rate for a state won by Clinton was 44 percent, while the average state won by Sanders had a turnout rate of 31 percent.\n\nThere's another way to define a high-turnout primary or caucus -- to see how much turnout grew in 2016 compared with the last contested Democratic primary year, 2008.\n\nTo do this, we compared the number of Democratic ballots cast in 2008 to the number cast in 2016, once again using U.S. Elections Project data.\n\nThe chart below shows how primary turnout grew (the positive values) or shrunk (the negative values) between 2008 and 2016. Once again, Sanders\u2019 states are in bold:\n\nSo, with this measurement too, states that Sanders won are clustered near the top of the list -- but once again, there are some important caveats.\n\nFor starters, the only primary state Sanders won that saw turnout growth this year was a real outlier, Michigan. Due to an intra-party dispute in 2008, Obama wasn\u2019t on the ballot in Michigan eight years ago. As a result, it\u2019s no surprise to see turnout more than double in 2016. And we\u2019ll discount Minnesota, since its caucus participation figure for 2016 is an estimate, and was virtually the same numerically as 2008.\n\nThat leaves five states won by Sanders where turnout increased. But it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that each was a caucus state, and the increases in turnout were extraordinarily small in the context of a primary season where millions of votes have been cast. Alaska was up 1,979, Idaho was up 2,660, Kansas was up 2,911, Maine was up 1,330, and Colorado was up 3,507.\n\nIn most states -- including most of those won by Sanders such as New Hampshire and Wisconsin -- turnout has actually fallen compared with the 2008 primaries, when Obama was running to become the first African-American president.\n\nWith Democratic turnout down almost everywhere compared with 2008, it\u2019s a stretch for Sanders to tout his ability to win by drawing waves of additional voters to the polls.\n\nIn fact, Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist, not only agreed with our conclusions but also also volunteered to run the math on how Sanders\u2019 share of the vote has been influenced by three factors -- the percentage of African-American voters, whether the state was in the northern or southern United States, and turnout.\n\nHe found that race and region were powerful predictors of how well Sanders did -- and that turnout mattered very little.\n\nSanders said, \"We win when voter turnout is high, we lose when it is low.\"\n\nSanders did notch a few notable victories in high-turnout primaries, but it would be cherry-picking to focus only on primaries. Sanders has mostly won caucuses, which have produced the lowest turnout rates of 2016 across the board. And while Sanders did win the handful of states where Democratic turnout increased over 2008, these increases were tiny, casting doubt on how significant an accomplishment this is.\n\nThe statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
