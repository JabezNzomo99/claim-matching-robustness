This is her latest ode to coronavirus.\u201d\n\nAyres tweeted that she didn\u2019t write the poem. It was actually written by Jan Beaumont, a New Zealand woman.\n\nPeople have widely shared the poem \u201cLet\u2019s All Drink to Lockdown\u201d on social media with attribution to Ayres in recent weeks. The poem compares an elderly woman\u2019s experiences during the coronavirus pandemic to those during previous points in her life, such as the \u201csex and drugs and rock \u2018n roll\u201d of the 1960s.\n\nAyres, known for works such as \u201cWith These Hands\u201d and \u201cUp In The Attic,\u201d did not write the poem, however.\n\n\u201cThis poem seems to be everywhere attributed to me but it isn\u2019t mine,\u201d Ayres tweeted on April 14. \u201cIt\u2019s by Jan Beaumont.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Beaumont originally posted the poem on Facebook on March 27. Three days after posting it, the poem had been shared more than 1,400 times and garnered more than 500 comments, according to Ryman Healthcare, the firm that operates the retirement village where Beaumont lives in New Zealand.\n\n\u201cIt took me all of 20 minutes,\u201d Beaumont is quoted as saying on Ryman Healthcare\u2019s website. \u201cIt was just something to pass the time really and to give my friends a giggle and now it\u2019s gone to the UK, Canada, South Africa, America, Australia\u2026 and that\u2019s just on my page!\u201d\n\nBeaumont addressed the misattribution in a comment on her Facebook page.
