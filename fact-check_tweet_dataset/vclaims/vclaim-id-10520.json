No, that's not true. The story was made up by a site that likes to invent fictional stories about various people under the guise of faux satire (\"fauxtire\"), the events did not happen.\n\nThe story came from an article published on April 23, 2018 on Huzlers titled \"Lil Tay Rushed to Hospital After Being Beat By Group of Children At a Playground\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLOS ANGELES - It is being reported that the internet famous 9 year old 'Lil Tay' has been admitted to the ER after she was allegedly beat savagely by a group of children while she played at a local playground. According to a witness, Noah Parsons, who was walking by the park and recognized one of the girls playing at the park as being Lil Tay, he asked for a photograph. Other children also playing at the park asked why as they didn't know Lil Tay was famous. According to Noah, he then showed all the children a video of Lil Tay from her Instagram page when all of a sudden they began beating Lil Tay. \"I guess they found her annoying\" said Noah. The group of children and their respective parents then fled the playground. It is believed that there was about 5 children age ranged 7-12 involved in the assault.\n\nThe article might have been mistaken for real news by some who saw it only on social media:\n\nIf you don't know who Lil Tay is, Metro recently profiled her:\n\nShe is no stranger to fights either, as that article notes:\n\nOn April 16, 2018, Tay was filmed getting involved in (or at least witnessing) a fight between Bhad Barbie and Woah Vicky. Later she responded to the fight by attacking Bhad Barbie online, writing: 'How a girl gone talk bout Gucci flip flops when u only can afford tank tops/Btw you look like a rat with draw one eyebrows...(sic) 'Tf happens to ur eye brows/Ima smack yo mama when I see her.... Broke ass b****,you can't fight for s*** and you a b****... 'F*** Bhad Bhabie, she tryna act all cool with her bodyguard, but she can't do s***. She can't even punch right, cause she a p****.'\n\nBut Huzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: 28 Year-Old Man Did NOT Overdose From Marijuana\n\u2022 Fake News: Fortnite Creator Did NOT Admit Game's Purpose Is To Prepare Young Men For War\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Leave Store After Announcing He Will Pay For Every Customers' Cart\n\u2022 Fake News: Mexican Boy NOT Arrested & Deported For Singing Rancheras At A Local Walmart Store\n\u2022 Fake News: 11 Year Old Boy NOT Arrested For Yodeling In A Walmart Store", "lang": "en"}
