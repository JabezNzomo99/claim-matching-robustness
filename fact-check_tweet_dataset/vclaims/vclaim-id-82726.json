Peter King (R-N.Y.) in the House. This message has been repeated by other top Democrats, including Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail and President Obama in his weekly address, calling on Congress to close the so-called \u201cloophole\u201d that allows individuals listed on the federal no-fly list to buy firearms or explosives.\n\nAs our friends at FactCheck.org found, there were about 800,000 people on the Terrorist Watchlist as of September 2014, according to Terrorist Screening Center Director Chris Piehota\u2019s testimony to the House committee. Among them, about 8 percent (64,000 people) were on the no-fly list and 0.8 percent (6,400) of the total number of people on the watch list were Americans (U.S. citizens or permanent legal residents) on the no-fly list, Piehota said.\n\nIf a person is on the Terrorist Watchlist, the DOJ would be pinged and the attorney general would decide whether the person \u201cis known (or appropriately suspected) to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism, or providing material support or resources for terrorism,\u201d and whether there is \u201creasonable belief\u201d that the weapon would be used in connection with terrorism.\n\n\u201cTo be perfectly clear here, the Justice Department obviously takes every step possible to keep firearms and other dangerous weapons out of the hands of al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations,\u201d DOJ spokesman Dean Boyd was quoted in an April 2007 article about the bill in New Jersey\u2019s The Record. \u201cHowever, this legislation is specifically designed to address the issue of firearms transfers to individual suspects who may be on a watch list.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many people on the no-fly list have attempted and succeeded in purchasing guns. There were people on the Terrorist Watchlist who were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 2,233 times from 2004 to 2014. A March 2015 GAO analysis at the request of Feinstein found that out of the 2,233 times, 91 percent (2,043) of the transactions were allowed to proceed, and 190 were denied. (The three-page analysis is embedded at the end of this fact-check.) We requested a breakdown of the number of people who were on the no-fly list, but the GAO said it was not able to share the information publicly because the TSA considers the no-fly list numbers sensitive information.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times editorial board, which opposed the Feinstein proposal, noted that her bill would not have affected the San Bernardino attackers, because \u201cneither of them was on the watch list, at least as far as has been reported.\u201d And there is no available information on whether any of the weapons purchased by people on the watch list from 2000 to 2014 were used in a crime, or an act of terrorism, according to the editorial board.\n\nA spokesperson for Durbin said referring to a no-fly list in connection with the Feinstein bill is a shorthand description of the provisions: \u201cIt\u2019s a rhetorical point being made: Why should a suspected terrorist be able to purchase firearm in this country? That\u2019s what we\u2019re addressing in this bill.\u201d The DOJ instead would create a new list, which may or may not be the same as the current Terrorist Watchlist, the spokesperson said.\n\nAshley Schapitl, Feinstein\u2019s spokeswoman, noted the no-fly list is a subset of the FBI Terrorist Watchlist Database. We asked her why the rhetoric has focused on this particular list, rather than making it clear that the bill is more broad-ranging. Schapitl noted that when Feinstein has, indeed, explained the nuances of the bill in detail in the past, and pointed to two examples.\n\nThe Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015 would have given the discretion to the attorney general and DOJ to decide whether or not to deny the sale and transfer of firearms and explosives to people on the Terrorist Watchlist. It also does not immediately ban someone on a no-fly list, or even the broader Terrorist Watchlist, from buying a gun.\n\nWe advocate precise and accurate language that minimizes public confusion. In this case, politicians are focusing on the specific no-fly list when referring to Feinstein\u2019s amendment. But the actual provisions in the bill were more broad-reaching, and the provisions were more nuanced than the catchy phrase: \u201cIf you\u2019re too dangerous to board a plane, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun.\u201d This is the language that Feinstein has used, and that her fellow Democratic lawmakers, Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail and also President Obama have repeated.", "lang": "en"}
