Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home coronavirus order.\n\n\"Operation Gridlock,\" as it was called, was \"probably the largest showing to date of conservative pushback against social distancing restrictions,\" the Washington Post reported.\n\nIn response, Whitmer, a Democrat elected in 2018, said at a news conference: \"We know that this demonstration is going to come at a cost to people\u2019s health.\" COVID-19 can be spread among people in close proximity who touch each other and don\u2019t wear masks, she said.\n\nDays after the Lansing rally, this claim started popping up on Facebook:\n\n\"A Lansing protester just announced his virus test results were positive.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nGiven that there are any number of ways a person could make an announcement that wouldn\u2019t necessarily get wide attention, we\u2019re not rating this post on our Truth-O-Meter. But we dug into it enough to know there isn\u2019t conclusive public evidence to suggest that this happened in the manner this Facebook post says.\n\nMichigan ranks near the top among the states in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Whitmer has faced backlash over the restrictions she has put in place to try to slow spread.\n\nWe searched Google and Nexis news archives and found no stories about a participant at the rally announcing he had tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nWe did find a number of other posts sharing what appeared to be screenshots of a post to an Operation Gridlock group that read, with misspellings, \"Hey, everybody, we did great today!\" but that he just received results from his doctor showing he tested positive for COVID-19. He identified himself as \"the guy witha dont trad on me flag.\"\n\nThe author of the supposed post is named \"Moose Plissken.\" A search of Facebook users by that name turned up no hits, as did a search of news stories.\n\nAnother Facebook user posted that she heard secondhand about a Lansing protester testing positive. According to that user, a woman who attended the rally told a friend of the user that she received positive test results the day after the rally.\n\nAnd a different Facebook user claimed in a post four days after the rally that a Lansing protester had just \"posted on the private FB protester page that his results came back positive.\" No link, screenshot or additional information was provided.\n\nThe Michigan Conservative Coalition and the Michigan Freedom Fund were identified as organizers of the rally. The coalition told PolitiFact about the Facebook claim: \"No knowledge of this.\" The fund didn\u2019t reply.", "lang": "en"}
