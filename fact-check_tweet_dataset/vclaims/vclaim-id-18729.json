Now Mr. Trump suggests that he would have lost the popular vote by a much smaller margin, or even won it, were it not for Google\u2019s machinations.\n\nHe appears to be referring to a disputed estimate given by Robert Epstein, a psychologist and former editor in chief at Psychology Today who says he supported and voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn a 2017 white paper, Mr. Epstein examined how Google Search might have influenced undecided voters in the 2016 election by providing more positive results for one candidate than the other. He estimated that the search results may have swayed \u201cat least 2.6 million votes to Clinton.\u201d When he testified to Congress this summer, Mr. Epstein added that the estimate was a \u201crock bottom minimum\u201d and that up to 10.4 million votes could have been shifted to Mrs. Clinton.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Epstein took issue with Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of his work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never said Google manipulated the 2016 elections,\u201d he said. \u201cThe range of numbers he listed in the tweet is also incorrect.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
