However, the video, which seems to show people under the influence of drugs, was filmed in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nA video showing people who appear to be impaired by drugs on a dirty sidewalk has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook.\n\nThe problem is that the video is captioned: \u201cWelcome to California\u2026 Where Democrats run things.\u201d The 16-second clip, however, was filmed in Pennsylvania, where control of state government is split between Republicans, who have a majority in the Legislature, and Democrats, who occupy the governor\u2019s office.\n\nThe video was recorded on Kensington Avenue in Philadelphia, an area that has been hit hard by poverty and the opioid crisis. It shows the street block just south of the Somerset Station train stop.\n\nIn the first frame of the video, part of the Great Wall restaurant\u2019s sign is visible, and the logo for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which runs the train stop, can be seen down the street.\n\nThe opioid epidemic has received national attention as drug overdose deaths continue to rise across the country. According to a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released in November, Pennsylvania had the third highest drug overdose death rate in 2017. California was tied for the fifth lowest.\n\nThe Facebook page that mislabeled the video belongs to conservative commentator David Harris Jr. Its \u201cabout\u201d page says: \u201cNews and current events that matter to us. No nonsense, no bias, just truth.\u201d But this video was falsely labeled.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
