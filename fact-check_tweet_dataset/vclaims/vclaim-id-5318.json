Some children do not have attorneys.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s zero-tolerance policy for people illegally crossing the Southwest border, which resulted in the separation of families, brought much attention to the circumstances of young immigrant children. A recent Associated Press story, for example, documented the story of a 1-year-old baby from Honduras who faced a deportation hearing represented by a lawyer but without his father, who had brought him to the U.S.\n\nThe issue has prompted several inquiries from our readers, many curious whether children are in fact appearing in immigration court without a parent, guardian or even legal representation.\n\nOne reader asked whether it was true that \u201cimmigrant toddlers\u201d were \u201cordered to appear in court alone.\u201d Another reader questioned the accuracy of a popular meme on Facebook, which reads: \u201cFor the first time in the 242 year history of the United States of America, a one-year-old child appears in court as a defendant.\u201d\n\nThat meme is false. It has happened before.\n\n\u201cToddlers appearing in court without an attorney is nothing new, unfortunately,\u201d Megan McKenna, senior director of communications and community engagement at Kids in Need of Defense, told us. The nonprofit group\u2019s lawyers work to represent immigrant children in court.\n\nThe law that created the current program for so-called \u201cunaccompanied alien children\u201d \u2014 minors who illegally entered the U.S. alone, or were separated from the adult who brought them \u2014 dates to 2002, when the Department of Homeland Security was established and the care and custody for these children was transferred from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Department of Health and Human Services. The unaccompanied minors are housed in shelters \u2014 for 57 days, on average \u2014 unless or until they are released to a relative or sponsor as they await their immigration hearings.\n\nSuch children facing deportation proceedings are not guaranteed a right to an attorney.\n\nAnd while pro-bono services often help fill that void, many children are left without counsel to effectively mount a defense against a government attorney arguing for deportation. Government data indicate that, of all cases from fiscal year 2005 through May 2018, half of juveniles in deportation proceedings were not represented by an attorney. For cases that began in fiscal year 2018 \u2014 which now includes all juveniles, not only those found to be \u201cunaccompanied,\u201d due to a reporting change \u2014 about 69 percent were not represented.\n\nKids in Need of Defense reports that a child with an attorney is five times more likely to gain U.S. protection, such as asylum.\n\nWhen the children are babies or toddlers, the lawyers representing them typically work with the adults caring for the children during immigration proceedings to understand the reasons they came to the U.S., McKenna said. In addition to crossing the border alone, children that young may be deemed unaccompanied because they were brought by someone \u201cother than a parent,\u201d McKenna noted, such as a \u201csmuggler or another relative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very young kids who come without a parent or legal guardian, it\u2019s often there\u2019s some strong push factor in the home country that is driving this,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any parents who would want their 1- or 2-year-old, or any age, to make this journey \u2026 to the U.S. without someone very close to them.\u201d\n\nIn fiscal year 2016 \u2014 from Oct. 1, 2015, to Sept. 30, 2016 \u2014 there were 170 new cases for unaccompanied children in which the respondent was a 1-year-old, according to numbers provided to FactCheck.org by the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review. In fiscal year 2017, there were 172 cases. And, as of June 30, there were 104 such cases in fiscal year 2018.\n\nThe total number of babies younger than age 1 \u2014 70 so far in fiscal year 2018 \u2014 is up from the previous two years, according to the office and as Kaiser Health News first reported. That number was 24 in all of fiscal year 2017 and 46 in fiscal year 2016.", "lang": "en"}
