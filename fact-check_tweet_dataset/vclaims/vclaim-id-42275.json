The dead bodies of terrorists will no longer be handed over to their families. The bodies will be buried where they are killed. Is the Army\u2019s decision a correct one?\u201d\n\nThe Quint spoke to Army sources who confirmed that it has not taken any such decision.\n\nThe post had been shared 264 times on Facebook at the time this article was written. A video posted by ABP News, back in June 2018, also makes similar claims.\n\nThe description box of the video says: \u201cThe Army has also changed its strategy and has decided to no more hand over the dead bodies of JeM, LeT, or ISIS terrorists to their respective families. In fact, they would be buried by the Army at a secret location.\u201d\n\nResponding to the post, an Army spokesperson said, \u201cThe claim is absolutely false. The Army has taken no such decision and it is beyond even the figment of imagination for us to think of something like this\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
