Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: In the video, the students chanted the slogans \u2018Hinduon ki kabr khudegi, AMU ki chaathi par\u2019 (Graves of Hindus will be dug on the chest of AMU). Fact: In the video, the students chanted \u2018Hindutva ki kabr khudegi, AMU ki dharthi par\u2019 (The grave of Hindutva will be dug on the land of AMU). The slogans were against Hindutva, not the Hindus. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nIn the video, the students can be heard chanting \u2018Hindutva ki kabr khudegi, AMU ki dharthi par, Savarkar ki kabr khudegi, AMU ki dharthi par, BJP ki kabr khudegi, AMU ki dharthi par, Brahmanvaadh ki kabr khudegi, AMU ki dharthi par, Jaathivaadh ki kabr khudegi, AMU ki dharthi par\u2019 (The grave of Hindutva will be dug on the land of AMU, the grave of Savarkar will be dug on the land of AMU, the grave of BJP will be dug on the land of AMU, the grave of Brahminism will be dug on the land of AMU, the grave of Casteism will be dug). So, the students in the video raised slogans against Hindutva, not the Hindus, as stated in the post.\n\nOn YouTube, the same video with the date of upload as 14 December 2019, can be seen with the title \u2018Aligarh Muslim University (Amu) slogans against BJP, Hindutva and Veer Savarkar\u2019. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, in the video, the AMU students weren\u2019t chanting \u2018Hinduon ki kabr khudegi, AMU ki chaathi par\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
