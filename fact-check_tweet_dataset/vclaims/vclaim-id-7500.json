It also might not be the same from year to year.\n\nIt is difficult to measure the overall effects of immigration on jobs definitively.\n\nStudies that have tried to do it in the UK have sometimes reached opposing conclusions about whether it increases or decreases wages overall but they tend to agree that immigration has a small impact on average wages of existing workers.\n\nThe effects of immigration on workers within specific wage ranges or in specific occupations are more significant. There is quite a lot of evidence that immigration affects low-waged workers the most negatively, and not just in construction.\n\u2022 Research from University College London finds that an inflow of immigrants the size of 1% of the UK-born population leads to a 0.6% decline in the wages of the 5% lowest paid workers and to an increase in the wages of higher paid workers.\n\u2022 Similarly, another study focusing on wage effects at the occupational level during 1992 and 2006, found that, in the unskilled and semi-skilled service sector, a 1% rise in the share of immigrants reduced average wages in that occupation by 0.5%.\n\u2022 An updated version of this study, considering the period between 1992 and 2014, found similar results. This study found that a 1% rise in the share of immigrants reduced averages wages in unskilled and semi-skilled service sector by just under 0.2%.\n\nThe available research also shows that any declines in wages are likely to be greatest for resident workers who are themselves migrants. This is because the skills of new immigrants are likely to be more similar to the skills of migrants already employed in the UK than for those of UK-born workers.\n\nDeclines in the wages and employment of UK-born workers in the short run can be offset by rising wages and employment in the long run.\n\nRead our full briefing on How immigrants affect jobs and wages, which was written by Oxford University\u2019s Migration Observatory in collaboration with Full Fact.", "lang": "en"}
