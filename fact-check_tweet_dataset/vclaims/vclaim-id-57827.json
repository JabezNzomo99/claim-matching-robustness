This is false: The image, taken from a CNN interview of New York's mayor, has been doctored and the false headline added to it.\n\nOne Facebook post featuring the image, shared more than 200 times and archived here, claims that \u201cCovid 19 cases in Nigeria are false because the government are (sic) taking advantage of it to embezzle, launder money and enrich themselves says CNN\u201d.\n\nThe image features a breaking-news banner that reads: \u201cFalse COVID-19 cases in Nigeria\u201d. A smaller strap underneath it adds: \u201cNigerian government accused of taking advantage of the pandemic\u201d.\n\nThe same image has been shared in another Facebook post here, as well as on WhatsApp.\n\nWhat does it show?\n\nAFP ran multiple reverse image searches and found that the image showing CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was taken from this video of an interview in March.\n\nThe banner in the original video read: \u201cFEMA declares New York \u2018major disaster\u2019 as coronavirus surges\u201d. Throughout the interview, there was not a single mention of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. You can read the transcript here.\n\nBlitzer has had two other interviews with De Blasio since the pandemic hit the United States, the first on April 4 and the second on April 18, 2020, in which they wore different clothing. They did not speak about Nigeria in these interviews, either.\n\nThe misleading image was doctored by using a screenshot from the original CNN interview and replacing the original headlines, in this case with false claims about Nigeria.\n\nFabricated TV banners are frequently created either by using an editing tool like Photoshop or a meme generator like the website Break Your Own News, which has been used to make other false claims since the coronavirus outbreak went global.\n\nOne example was the story that Russian President Vladimir Putin had set lions loose to enforce a lockdown in the country, which AFP debunked here.\n\nBelow is a template from the website showing how easy it is to manipulate an image by simply adding new text in the respective headline fields.\n\nAs of May 5, 2020, Nigeria had recorded 2,950 positive cases of COVID-19, with 98 deaths, according to the country\u2019s centre for disease control.", "lang": "en"}
