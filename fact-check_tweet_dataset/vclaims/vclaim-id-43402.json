The image has gone viral with the claim that \u201cOoty-Coimbatore road is reclaimed by its original owners.\u201d It is being asserted that the deers sat on the road as the lockdown imposed to battle coronavirus pandemic has restricted human movement.\n\nJournalist and Padma Shri recipient Mrinal Pande also tweeted (archive link) the viral image. Pande\u2019s tweet was retweeted over 1900 times and liked over 11,000 times. Similarly, IPS HGS Dhaliwal (archive link) also posted the viral image.\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search on Google and found that the viral image was published by Japan Today and SoraNews24 in 2014. According to the reports, the image is from Nara Park in Japan. The park is a popular tourist spot and is known for its deer population. Moreover, a Japanese signboard is visible in the picture, hinting that it cannot be from India.\n\nThe reason why so many deers turned up at Nara Park was explained by the Nara City Tourism Association (NCTA) . \u201cNara Park covers a broad area, and in fact, a portion of it is made of by the grounds of Kasuga Taisha Shrine. The deity enshrined therein is Takemi Kajichi no Mikoto, said to have ridden to Nara upon a sacred deer from Kashima Shrine (also written with a character for \u201cdeer\u201d) in Ibaraki Prefecture. Because of this legend, deer were thought of as sacred animals\u2013the helpers of gods\u2013and have been carefully protected for many years. Even today, Nara\u2019s deer are carefully protected as \u201cnatural monuments.\u201d\n\nThere are several videos available about Nara Park on YouTube.\n\nThus, the social media claim about the viral image is false and misleading. On March 20, National Geographic debunked similar claims of elephants overdosed on corn wine in the Chinese province Yunan and dolphins spotted in Venice.", "lang": "en"}
