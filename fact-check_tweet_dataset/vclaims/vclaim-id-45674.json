The Quint received a query on the claims being made in the message on its WhatsApp helpline.\n\nWe did not find any record of the statements made by the world leaders as mentioned in the viral image. Further, there are no reports of any calls being made by the said leaders to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, except US President Donald Trump. Let\u2019s look at the official stance of each country on India-China tensions: On 27 May, regarding India-China tensions, Trump had taken to Twitter, saying the US is \u201cready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute.\u201d He also said that he had spoken to Prime Minister Modi who was \u201cnot in a good mood about what is going on with China\u201d. However, the mediation offer was rejected by both \u2013 China and India. Anurag Srivastava, spokesperson of the foreign ministry, as quoted by NDTV said India is \u201cEngaged with Chinese side to peacefully resolve it\u201d. It is pertinent to note that Modi and Trump reportedly had a telephone conversation on Tuesday, 2 June, wherein the two leaders discussed the unrest in US since the death of George Floyd, as well as tensions at the Indo-China border, among other things.\n\nOn Monday, 1 June, in a conversation with The Economic Times, Russian Deputy Ambassador to India Roman Babushkin said that India and China are \u201cduly equipped to find way out for mutual satisfaction.\u201d \u201cOf course we are worried with the current situation at LAC. However, as we know, there are dedicated specific mechanisms and tools developed by both countries including hotlines, special representatives dialogue, and even informal summits. We are confident that the Indian and Chinese friends are duly equipped to find way out for mutual satisfaction. We would encourage every endeavour in this regard,\u201d he said. Israel has not made any on-record statement on the India-China tensions. Further, while speaking to ThePrint\u2019s Shekhar Gupta, Dr Ron Malka, ambassador of Israel to India described the relations of the country with India and China. He said that Israel\u2019s relationship with India is a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d and that with China is \u201cpurely economic.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a strategic partnership, much much more wider and deeper and stronger and the scope of it is much much bigger. As I said, two democracies with many many similarities, with mutual trust, mutual respect, India is a strategic partner of Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cEven China knows that the relationship with India is different and it\u2019s understood,\u201d he added. He said that India\u2019s friendship values are much beyond the economic relations.\n\nThe Japan government has not made any official statement on the India-China tensions. In the absence of any public record, news reports of the statement, it is evident that the viral image falsely quoted world leaders on their support to India-China tensions.", "lang": "en"}
