We haven\u2019t seen a copy of this research but we\u2019ve asked for it.\n\nHow many people are on out-of-work benefits?\n\nWhen the Labour government first came to office in May 1997 the claimant count (the number of people claiming benefits because of unemployment) was around 1.6 million. At its lowest point it was about 780,000 in February 2008 and at its highest it returned to around 1.6 million in October 2009.\n\nIf you look at all out-of-work benefits\u2014including incapacity benefits for example\u2014the trends are similar. Around five million people claimed these benefits in 1999 (the earliest these figures are available), and that figure was almost the same in 2010. It\u2019s fallen to under four million since then.\n\nThese figures don\u2019t tell us anything about how many people were on out-of-work benefits continuously from one year to the next.", "lang": "en"}
