Some posts also make the claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the pandemic, unlike in the U.S. and Europe ( here ).\n\nSome posts go on to include further claims alluding to a possible conspiracy by the Chinese government and Democratic party members in the U.S. to financially cripple America and negatively frame President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nIn early February, when cities like Wuhan were in lockdown, fears about the spreading of the coronavirus wiped $393 billion off China\u2019s stock market, despite government support moves, Reuters reported ( here ). A nearly 8% plunge on the Shanghai composite index was its biggest daily fall in more than four years.\n\nThe wipeout came even as the Chinese central bank made its biggest cash injection to the financial system since 2004 and despite apparent regulatory moves to curb selling.\n\nBy mid-March, factory production data continued to underscore the impact of the pandemic on the country, as Chinese stocks fell again to six-week lows, ( here ). The claim that the Chinese stock market was unaffected by the spread of the virus is therefore untrue.\n\nAs it begins to ease its strict coronavirus curbs, China has urged authorities to pay more attention to asymptomatic cases, as part of efforts to allay public fears that large numbers of infectious people have gone unreported. Residents and medical staff in Wuhan told Reuters that testing problems at some hospitals meant that some infected people were not identified, and thus were not included in official data. ( here )\n\nDespite criticisms related to the Chinese government\u2019s lack of transparency, official coronavirus data released by Chinese health officials and reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) do disprove the claims made on social media that only Wuhan was affected.\n\nAn early WHO coronavirus situation report from January 20 confirmed the presence of coronavirus cases in Guangdong province, as well as in the Beijing and Shanghai municipalities ( here ).\n\nInformation from China\u2019s National Health Commission (NHC) also confirms that coronavirus cases were identified in Beijing and Shanghai, spreading beyond Hubei province, where Wuhan\u2014the epicenter of the virus\u2014is located, ( here ). As late as March 28, the NHC confirmed 7 newly imported coronavirus cases in Shanghai and 4 in Beijing, ( here ).\n\nAn interactive map of coronavirus statistics by Johns Hopkins University, a reliable academic source for information on the pandemic\u2019s development, also corroborates that in China, the coronavirus spread beyond Hubei\u2019s borders, ( here ). The claims on social media alleging that in China the coronavirus was geographically confined to the city of Wuhan are therefore also inaccurate. However, it is true that Beijing and Shanghai, both cities that have adopted strict measures aimed at slowing transmission rates, have so far avoided a major coronavirus outbreak. In a report from the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, the head of Shanghai's medical team fighting the virus is quoted as saying that \u201dthe measures taken by Shanghai over the past month are effective\u201d. ( here )\n\nFalse: The coronavirus spread beyond the city of Wuhan, even if it has not so far caused major outbreaks in Beijing and Shanghai. The Chinese stock market has been affected by the virus.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
