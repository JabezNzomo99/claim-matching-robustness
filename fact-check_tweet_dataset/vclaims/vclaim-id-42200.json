At the background a voice can be heard narrating in Marathi, \u201cTerrorist caught. Along with him, two guns have also been seized.\u201d The video has been used in several other pages, with similar narratives.\n\nThe video is originally of a mock drill that was conducted by the Riot Control Police, Quick Response Team and the Virar Police station officers.\n\nBOOM spoke to Jayant Bajbale, Sub-Divisional Officer, Virar, who confirmed the routine mock drill of counter terror attack. \u201cIt was an exercise of 30 minutes. There were 25 people from the QRT, and 15 from RCP and some from the local police station,\u201d Bajbale said.\n\nBajbale informed that a member from the local police team had doubled up as a mock terrorist to help in the exercise.\n\nSuch mock drills, according to Bajbale, are conducted in crowded places mostly. \u201cThis in turn makes us check whether their fire safety and other security options are in place as well,\u201d he added.
