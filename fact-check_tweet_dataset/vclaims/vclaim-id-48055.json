Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: The court has rejected inspection of helmet usage in all states. It is not mandatory to use helmets in the municipal corporation boundaries. Fact: Devendra Pratap Singh Chauhan has posted a video on his Facebook wall in June clarifying that there is no truth in the message which was circulating under his name. Also, no information was found about the verdict given by any court rejecting inspection of helmets in all states. In the recently passed \u2018Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 2019\u2019 also, there is no exemption for the helmet rule in municipal corporation limits. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google about \u2018Devendra Pratap Singh Chauhan helmet\u2019 a video of him giving an explanation about the viral message was found. According to the video, there is no truth in that message which was circulating under his name.\n\n\n\nHe also posted an explanation in June about this viral message on his Facebook wall.\n\n\n\nAlso, neither the supreme court nor any other court has given a verdict rejecting helmet inspection in all states. In the recently implemented \u2018Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 2019\u2019, section 129 talks about the usage of the helmet and does not mention any exemption within municipal corporation limits.\n\nArticles about the enforcement of helmet rules in different states can be read here, here and here.\n\n\n\nLastly, the post, which is circulating with a lawyer\u2019s name Chauhan, claiming that there is no need for helmet usage in municipal corporation boundaries is fake.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
