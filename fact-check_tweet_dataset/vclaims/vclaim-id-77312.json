Jerry Brown\u2019s signature the bill will go into effect in November.\n\nThe Golden State\u2019s per gallon gas tax is already high. We set out to fact-check whether it really will be the highest in the country.\n\nAsked for evidence, Patterson\u2019s spokeswoman pointed us to a map showing state-by-state gasoline tax rates produced in March 2016 by the nonprofit Tax Foundation.\n\nThat map and its numbers, however, are outdated.\n\nA map produced in January 2017 by the foundation includes the most current state-by-state gas tax rates. Those rates are calculated by adding up state and local gas taxes and fees.\n\nIt shows Pennsylvania has the highest per gallon tax rate in the nation at more than 58 cents. California\u2019s current per gallon tax is about 38 cents per gallon, the seventh highest in the nation.\n\nDo the arithmetic: Even with the 12-cent increase, California\u2019s tax will trail Pennsylvania\u2019s by 8 cents per gallon.\n\n\"You won\u2019t be No. 1, that\u2019s for sure,\" said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation. \"Pennsylvania will still be the highest.\"\n\nA chart produced in January 2017 by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, confirms the tax foundation\u2019s figures, though it adds in the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax for each state.\n\nBased on current rates, California\u2019s increase will likely result in the second highest state gas tax in the nation, ahead of Washington and Hawaii.\n\nThis second highest tax ranking could leave California with the highest overall gas prices at the pump, according to energy analysts.\n\nWe looked at that topic in a recent article. As of this week, California\u2019s average price was $2.99 per gallon. It trailed only Hawaii\u2019s $3.04, for a margin of about 5 cents per gallon. The 12 cent per gallon increase could cause California to leap-frog Hawaii, analysts said.\n\nJoe Henchman, a vice president with the Tax Foundation, noted that California also adds a 2.25 percent sales tax on gasoline.\n\nThis sales tax is not counted by the foundation or the petroleum institute as part of the state\u2019s gas tax. But based on the current price of gasoline in the state, it represents about 6 or 7 cents per gallon in tax, which \"would not entirely close the gap with Pennsylvania,\" Henchman said.\n\nFive other states charge a sales tax on gasoline: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana and Illinois. Pennsylvania does not.\n\nRepublican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson claimed California\u2019s recent gas tax increase, once approved by Gov. Jerry Brown as expected, would result in the \"highest gas tax in the nation.\"\n\nCurrent figures from the Tax Foundation show California\u2019s per gallon gas tax will still trail Pennsylvania\u2019s rate by more than 6 cents, even after the tax hike goes into effect in November.\n\nCalifornia would likely move from seventh highest to second in the nation.\n\nThese figures are also confirmed by the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nIn the end, we rate Patterson\u2019s claim False.\n\nUPDATE: This fact-check has been updated with comments from Joe Henchman of the Tax Foundation about the sales tax California charges on gasoline.\n\nThe foundation provided us a second update later in April 2017 that accounted for an additional and less-publicized gas tax increase under California\u2019s new legislation. It concluded \"Pennsylvania will still be highest, but by a narrower margin.\" This latest update factors in an additional 7.5 cent per gallon gas tax increase that would start in July 2019. This is on top of the 12 cent per gallon hike that would go into effect in November.\n\nThe state\u2019s full gas tax increase would amount to 19.5 cents per gallon by this time. California\u2019s overall gas tax would climb to 58.3 cents per gallon under the foundation\u2019s latest calculations. We continue to rate Patterson's claim as False as the foundation concluded this higher California gas tax, even in 2019, would be \"just behind Pennsylvania's highest-in-the-nation 59.3 (cents-per-gallon) tax.\"\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
