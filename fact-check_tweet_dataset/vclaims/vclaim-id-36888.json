The claim is misleading; the photos show protesters who wore bandages to show solidarity with a student who lost an eye during clashes at another anti-citizenship law protest in December 2019.\n\nThe photos were published in this Facebook post on January 4, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cYou don't fear, that's a good thing, even home minister Amit Shah said you shouldn't have any fear. But tell me first, who is the doctor who has applied bandaged over the jacket and headscarf. There is a limit to lying.\u201d\n\nThe protesters in the photos can be seen wearing bandages over clothing, and holding placards in romanized Hindi-language that translate to English as: \u201cWe won\u2019t be feared, we will fight. No NRC, No CAA.\u201d\n\nNRC is an acronym for the National Register of Citizens, a government record of all Indian citizens in India\u2019s northeastern state of Assam. The register came under scrutiny after its most recent release in August 2019 was found to have omitted some two million people - mostly Muslims - effectively stripping them of Indian citizenship, as reported by AFP here on September 2, 2019.\n\nCAA is an acronym for the Citizenship Amendment Act, a new law passed by the Indian government on December 11, 2019. The law, which grants citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, sparked violent protests nationwide, as reported by AFP here on December 12, 2019.\n\nThe same photos were also shared in posts here, here and here on Facebook, and here, here and here on Twitter, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe photos have been shared in a misleading context; they show protesters rallying in solidarity with with a Jamia Millia Islamia University student who lost an eye during an earlier anti-citizenship law protest in Delhi.\n\nThe first image in the misleading posts carries a \u201cZafar Abbas\u201d watermark on the bottom left corner. AFP found a Delhi-based journalist with the same name, who shared it on his Twitter account here on December 29, 2019.\n\nDuring a phone conversation with AFP on January 9, 2020, Abbas said he took the photos during an anti-citizenship law protest in Jamia Nagar area of Delhi, India, on December 29, 2019.\n\n\u201cI clicked these pictures when the students and local residents decided to protest in a unique way by tying a bandage around one eye in solidarity with Minhajuddin, a student who lost an eye in Delhi police crackdown,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed Minhajuddin is a student of Delhi\u2019s Jamia Millia Islamia University who allegedly sustained permanent eye damage when police clashed with protesters during an anti-citizenship law protest on campus on December 15, 2019, according to reports by Indian news outlet News18 here and English-language newspaper Hindustan Times here.\n\nAbbas also shared a video from the solidarity protest on his Twitter account here on the same day.\n\nThe December 29 protest was also reported by local Indian media, including here by national broadcaster NDTV, here by English-language newspaper Millennium Post and here by English-language news magazine Outlook India.", "lang": "en"}
