That could save or improve the lives of 700 people, who may or may not otherwise have died in the same year.\n\n700 extra transplants a year is based on improving family consent rates for organ donation to \u201cworld class\u201d levels. Whether or not the claim is correct rests on whether the government\u2019s policy package will help increase consent rates at all or by enough, and how accurately the effect of increased consent on the number of transplants is being calculated.\n\nAs the government itself admits, there is limited evidence for how much its plans will deliver improved consent rates for organ transplants, if at all. It\u2019s plausible the system could reduce consent rates as well, but again the evidence for this in the context of the planned changes in England is limited.\n\nThe modelling behind the claim\u2014converting an increased consent rate into the number of extra transplants\u2014also rests on a lot of assumptions.\n\nAll in all, this claim hinges precariously on a lot of uncertainty.\n\nThe issues and figures around organ donation\n\nSome people in the UK choose to allow their organs to be donated after they die. Others donate while they\u2019re still alive\u2014people can survive with one kidney, for example.\n\nThere are just under 25 million people on the NHS opt-in organ donation register in the UK\u2014about 37% of the population.\n\nAs we\u2019ll explain more later, this doesn\u2019t automatically mean they\u2019ll end up being donors, nor does it mean that people who aren\u2019t on the register won\u2019t have their organs donated after death. About half of deceased organ donors last year were on the donor register.\n\nEvery year about 600,000 people in the UK die. But only about 6,000 are considered \u2018eligible donors\u2019\u2014meaning they\u2019ve died under the right circumstances and aren\u2019t medically unsuitable for a transplant.\n\nLast year only about 1,600 deceased people actually became donors, the drop-off mainly due to further medical concerns, logistical hurdles, or not getting consent from their families. People can donate more than one organ, and last year around 4,000 transplants took place from deceased donors.\n\nDonations after death are more common than living donations, but they\u2019re still relatively rare because they can only happen when people die in certain circumstances, and are medically suitable for a donation.\n\nSo when the government talks about saving 700 more lives a year, they\u2019re talking about increasing the number of transplants above 4,000.\n\nThere is a shortage of organs available for transplant in the UK and some people still die waiting for a transplant. We don\u2019t know exactly how many people die every year as a result of not getting a needed organ transplant, as there isn\u2019t complete data.\n\nIn 2017/18, 411 people died while waiting on the transplant list, and a further 755 were removed from the transplant list, mostly because they had become too ill. Many of those patients would have died shortly afterwards, but we don\u2019t know about their circumstances after leaving the list.\n\nMeanwhile around 6,000 people are currently waiting for an organ in the UK.\n\nHow organ donation currently works in the UK\n\nAt the moment, the system for organ transplants is different in different parts of the UK, because the health system is devolved.\n\nIn England, doctors need to get consent before they can remove organs from someone for a transplant. They aren\u2019t allowed to do so if the deceased person had previously refused consent. If no view had been expressed either way, consent is sought from an eligible relative.\n\nThey are allowed to proceed if the deceased had given consent, but they\u2019re still not obliged to do so, for example if the deceased\u2019s relatives object.\n\nThe system is similar in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nWales changed to an opt-out system in 2015. Here, consent is assumed from adults unless they have registered their wish not to be a donor. There are still restrictions on when doctors can proceed with a transplant, and relatives of the deceased can still stop the procedure.\n\nThe UK government wants to introduce a similar system in England, which is what\u2019s behind the news this month.\n\nThe current UK \u2018consent rate\u2019 for organ donation is around 66%\n\nThere are a lot of barriers to an organ transplant taking place. The most significant ones are based on whether the patient was on ventilation before death, and whether the patient\u2019s medical condition is suitable. Only if those tests are passed is consent sought from relatives of the deceased.\n\nA key measure of consent is called the \u2018consent rate\u2019, which looks at how many cases involved the family being approached and of these, how often consent was given.\n\nIn 2017/18, across the UK, consent was given an estimated 66% of the time when families were asked. Even then, only 70% of these cases where consent was given resulted in an actual donation last year.\n\nFamilies don\u2019t give consent for a variety of reasons. The most common include the patient having previously expressed a wish not to donate, when the family aren\u2019t sure what the patient\u2019s wishes would have been, the family feeling the process would take too long, and not wanting surgery done to the body.\n\nThe government wants that rate up to 80%\u2014which it calculates means 700 extra transplants a year\n\nThe consent rate is the baseline from which the effects of policy changes\u2014and so how many extra people\u2019s lives might be saved\u2014are calculated.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care, in conjunction with NHS Blood and Transplant, uses a model to work out how changes to the consent rate might change the number of donors. This involves making a lot of assumptions, and isn\u2019t a perfect predictor of what would actually happen.\n\nThe government uses the consent rate from 2016/17\u201463%\u2014as its baseline. If that 63% could be increased to 80%\u2014the government\u2019s ambition\u2014this model suggests that could mean around 700 extra transplants every year.\n\nThe actual impact assessment doesn\u2019t mention the 700 figure, its central estimate is a much lower increase to a consent rate of 70%\u2014resulting in around 250 extra transplants. Our calculations suggest 700 is roughly what the model would show if rates increased to 80%.\n\nNHS Blood and Transplant told us the estimates that were actually published in the impact assessment weren\u2019t predictions, they were just examples of what the model would show. They explained this was because the evidence was so uncertain.\n\nIn an early draft of the impact assessment behind the policy, the Department for Health and Social Care said:\n\n\u201cThe Government proposes to set an ambition to see consent rates increased to 80%. If this can be realised, it would mean about 280 more donors than current levels, which is equivalent to about 700 more organ transplants.\u201d\n\nA key assumption to all of these estimates is that the number of people who are medically suitable to donate organs doesn\u2019t change in future years.\n\nThere is no clear evidence the government\u2019s plans will increase consent rates, or by how much\n\nIn summarising its impact assessment, the government says immediately that the evidence behind the policy is scarce:\n\n\u201cWould opt-out change the organ donation consent rate? The evidence is inconclusive.\n\n\u201cWhile it seems that moving to an opt-out system is unlikely to decrease the consent rate, there is no unambiguous evidence that opt-out by itself increases consent rates.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that in some cases, when opt-out is implemented alongside other pro-organ donation policies, such as communications campaigns, consent rates increase.\u201d\n\nThis last point reflects the conclusion of the government\u2019s Chief Scientific Adviser, who looked at the available evidence and said \u201cwith moderate certainty\u201d, that when introduced as part of a wider communication and logistical package, opt-out systems can be associated with higher donation rates.\n\nThe government plans to do a communications campaign alongside the change in the policy anyway, so it thinks that the overall effect will be some positive shift in rates.\n\nCould consent rates actually fall with the policy change?\n\nPlausibly. The conclusions of the government\u2019s Chief Scientific Adviser leave some room for doubt.\n\nThe reasoning behind this possibility comes down to the fact that under both the existing system in England and the proposed new one, the family of potential donors still have an effective veto in some situations, especially where there\u2019s uncertainty as to the deceased person\u2019s wishes.\n\nOne theory is that families may be more likely to withold consent under a presumed consent system than under the current opt-in system.\n\nAs one recent study for Queen Mary University London found, consent rates can be lower in \u2018opt-out\u2019 systems because there is less of a clear signal of a deceased person\u2019s wishes. In an opt-in system, people give a clear indication that they wish to donate. As the study said: \u201cin the event of uncertainty, families are more likely to refuse consent\u201d.\n\nHowever it also cautioned that \u2018opt-out\u2019 alone wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad policy, it\u2019s just usually associated with creating more uncertainty. It said an effective system depends on people being well-informed about what the consent system is, on families talking to each other about their wishes, and on people having the ability to register their preferences clearly, to reduce uncertainty.\n\nThis study alone can\u2019t be used to prove the planned changes in England will reduce consent rates. For one thing, the government plans to keep the Organ Donation Register, so there will still be a route for people to express their wishes in this way.\n\nBut the research, along with the government\u2019s own impact assessment, does show there\u2019s a live debate as to whether the \u2018opt out\u2019 element of the organ transplant system actually makes consent more likely, or if it actually makes families more likely to refuse consent.\n\nThere are other ways of increasing the organ donation rate that may be more effective\n\nIncreased consent rates don\u2019t go hand-in-hand with more transplants. The transplant system has to be able to cope with an increased caseload.\n\nAs part of its impact assessment the government admitted that the transplantation system is currently under \u201cconsiderable pressure\u201d and that without increased investment in capacity, increased consent rates wouldn\u2019t necessarily see a corresponding increase in more transplants. For that reason, its policy plans also allow for the possibility of increased investment in the system itself, alongside the other costs.\n\nHow well the system runs is also a factor.\n\nSpain has one of the most consistently high rates of organ donation in the world. In 2016, its organ donation rate (the number of deceased people that become donors) was 43.4 per million people, compared with 21.1 in the UK, and its consent rate was about 85%.\n\nWhen Wales was considering introducing an opt-out system, an Assembly Committee visited Spain to see why organ donation rates were so high there. It concluded that improvements to the Spanish system were mainly the result of \u201cgood organisation\u201d.\n\nMore important than changes to the consent system and publicity campaigns, it felt, were organising services to ensure that more potential donors become actual donors. This means things like training more medical staff to coordinate transplants and better national coordination of donors and recipients.\n\nIn the UK, one factor that is already associated with higher consent rates from families is the presence of a specialist nurse when the family is approached. These nurses provide support to families during the consent process, and are currently present in nine out of ten cases where families are approached.\n\nJackie Doyle-Price MP has said that \u201cthe system that we are looking to introduce has much in common with that in Spain\u201d: meaning that changes to the consent system are only one aspect of what the Government has planned for the organ donation system in England.", "lang": "en"}
