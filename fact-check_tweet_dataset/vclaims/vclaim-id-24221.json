As per another claim in the same post, Rs 150 will be charged for every transaction if more than four transactions are done in anyone\u2019s bank account. The claims in the Facebook post are false.\n\nAs per the Facebook post (Screenshot give above), Rs 173 will be deducted from a person\u2019s bank account if he/she uses ATM machine to withdraw money more than four times. In another claim the post says that Rs 150 will be charged for every transaction if more than four transactions are done in anyone\u2019s bank account.\n\nAs per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, the customers can be charged for transactions at ATMs over and above the mandated number of free transactions. However, presently, these charges cannot exceed a maximum of \u20b920 per transaction (plus applicable taxes, if any) by his/her bank.\n\nThere is a limit of 4 free transactions (cumulative of deposits and withdrawal) in a month. However, 5th transaction onwards, Rs 150 per transaction (plus taxes as applicable) would be levied. However, this rule is already applicable since March, 1, 2017 (as stated on HDFC official website). Therefore, it would be wrong to say that any such rule is going to come into effect from June 1. So, no such rule is going to be implemented by banks from June 1.\n\nA Facebook user \u2018Struggler Mudhai RJ\u2019 shared a post claiming: \u090f\u091f\u0940\u090f\u092e \u0938\u0947 \u091a\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0905\u0927\u093f\u0915 \u092a\u0948\u0938\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0930 150 \u0930\u0941\u092a\u090f \u091f\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0938 \u0914\u0930 23 \u0930\u0941\u092a\u090f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0938 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091c \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0915\u0930 \u0915\u0941\u0932 173 \u0915\u091f\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0947\u0964 \u090f\u0915 \u0914\u0930 \u0924\u094b\u0939\u092b\u093e\u0964 \u090f\u0915 \u091c\u0942\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \u092e\u0947\u0902 4 \u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902\u091c\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0936\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0939\u0930 \u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902\u091c\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0936\u0928 \u092a\u0930 150 \u0930\u093f\u092a\u090f \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091c \u0932\u0917\u0947\u0917\u093e\u0964 \u091c\u0928\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0917\u0932\u0947 \u092a\u0930 \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091b\u0941\u0930\u093e \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092b\u0947\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0947? \u0915\u092e\u093e\u0913 \u0924\u094b \u091f\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0938, \u092c\u091a\u093e\u0913 \u0924\u094b \u091f\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0938 \u0914\u0930 \u0924\u094b \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091c\u092e\u093e \u0915\u0930\u093e\u0913 \u0924\u094b \u091f\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0938\u0964 \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0935\u093e\u092a\u0938 \u0928\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0932\u094b \u0924\u094b \u091f\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0938 (After withdrawing money more than four times from the ATM, a total of Rs 173 will be deducted (that includes a tax of Rs 150 and service charge of Rs 23). From June 1, after every 4 transactions, Rs 150 will be charged on every transaction. Why not stab the public in one go? If you earn, then taxed, if you save, then taxed, deposit to bank then taxed and withdraw then taxed. Please forward this message, don\u2019t sit quietly).\n\nWe did Google Search to find any news article related to this claim using appropriate keywords, but did not find any story on any such change going to happen from June 1.\n\nThen, we also scanned the official website of the RBI to find anything related to the claim in the Facebook post that Rs 173 will be deducted if transaction is done more than four times from ATM.\n\nOn the official website of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), we saw an information which reads \u2013 \u201cBanks must offer their savings bank account holders a minimum of five free transactions (including both financial and non-financial) in a month, irrespective of the location of ATMs. In case of ATMs located in six metro locations, viz. Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, banks must offer their savings bank account holders a minimum of three free transactions (including both financial and non-financial transactions) in a month. In case of ATMs located in six metro locations, viz. Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, banks must offer their savings bank account holders a minimum of three free transactions (including both financial and non-financial transactions) in a month.\u201d\n\nOn the official website of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) we also found that: customers can be charged for transactions at ATMs over and above the mandated number of free transactions. However, presently, these charges cannot exceed a maximum of \u20b920/- per transaction (plus applicable taxes, if any) by his / her bank.\n\nWe then contacted HDFC Bank and interacted with the EVA chat box of the customer service of the bank. When asked about the transaction charge of ATM, we received a reply from the bank that: if you are using the debit card at other bank ATMs you are eligible for 3 free transactions in metro areas (Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad) and 5 free transactions in non metro areas.\n\nBeyond the prescribed limit of transactions, savings and salary account holders will be charged Rs 20 for cash withdrawals per transaction and Rs 8.50 for non-financial transactions.\n\nOn the official website of HDFC we found that, there is a limit of 4 free transactions (cumulative of deposits and withdrawal) in a month. However, 5th transaction onwards, Rs 150 per transaction (plus taxes as applicable) would be levied.\n\nWe also found a notification on the official website of HDFC dates March 1, 2017. We can see on the notification that states: 4 free transactions can be done in a month. 5th transaction onwards, Rs 150 per transaction (plus tax) would be levied.\n\nWe used StalkScan to check the previous posts published by the Facebook user \u2018Struggler Mudhai RJ\u2019 and found many misleading posts on the page.\n\nConclusion: Banks are not going to make any new change from June 1 as claimed in the viral post on Facebook. The claims in the viral post are outdated.", "lang": "en"}
