And he kicked off his 62-minute speech \u2014 relatively short by his rally standards \u2014 by pouring praise on the state he\u2019s occasionally called a second home for decades. \u201cI love New Jersey, and I\u2019m thrilled to be right here back in the Garden State,\u201d Trump told the audience, a large chunk of which was decked in his trademark red hats.\n\nThe following day, photographs circulated via social media purporting to show piles of trash and debris supposedly left behind in the convention center\u2019s parking lot by \u201cselfish supporters [who] trashed everything in sight\u201d:\n\nThese photographs are genuine and accurately described, as reported by multiple local news outlets that published similar (and identical) pictures. NJ.com, for example, noted that while an adjacent park had been cleaned up by the following morning, the convention center\u2019s parking lot had not:\n\nThe thousands of people who descended upon the Jersey Shore town for President Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Keep America Great\u2019 rally at the Wildwoods Convention Center left behind a sea of trash in the parking lot \u2014 including their abandoned beach chairs and blankets \u2014 after the rally wrapped up. Rally-goers were allowed to bring chairs as they waited in line \u2014 some for up to 48 hours before the event \u2014 but they weren\u2019t allowed to bring them inside the venue. Factor in the blankets they used to stay warm, and all their drinks and food they were snacking on during the long wait in the parking lot and the convention center ends up with a parking lot full of trash to deal with Wednesday morning. Fox Park, however, where the line ended Tuesday and where crowds remained to watch Trump on the jumbotron when they couldn\u2019t get inside, was spotless Wednesday morning. City officials said the park cleanup was the responsibility of Wildwood, while the parking lot mess was the responsibility of the convention center, which Wildwood city does not manage.\n\nThe Cherry Hill Courier-Post reported that Wildwood\u2019s mayor was seeking reimbursement from the Trump campaign for services provided by the city in connection with the rally, including the removal of tons of trash.\n\nWildwood \u2014 a sandy-shored beach-and-bar town \u2014 could lose its cows in the Green New Deal, President Trump remarked at his Jersey Shore campaign rally Tuesday night. There was even less to be green about outside the Wildwoods Convention Center, where tons of items \u2014 chairs, blankets, food and drinks \u2014 were left behind in queue where Trumpers camped out for two days to get inside the venue. Items prohibited inside the 7,500-seat hall remained on the venue\u2019s grounds until either snatched up by scavengers or trashed by city public works Wednesday, according to Mayor Pete Byron. \u201cWe knew it was going to be a mess. We just didn\u2019t know to what degree,\u201d Byron told the Courier Post Wednesday. \u201cThis goes back to what I\u2019ve been saying \u2026 I don\u2019t believe, because of the nature of the event, the city should have to pay for any extra-curricular cost for this.\u201d When crowds cleared the area after the rally Tuesday night, few appeared to have gone back to retrieve their own items in lines. \u201cThe vast majority of people who came were expecting, \u2018we\u2019re going to get the worst beach chair out of our garage, and a raggedy old blanket we can do without\u2019 because they were going to leave it there,\u201d Byron explained. \u201cThis was not a city-promoted event. This was a political rally choreographed by the Secret Service,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nHowever, many attendees noted on the Wildwood Boardwalk\u2019s official Facebook page that much of the refuse was left behind not because \u201cselfish [Trump] supporters trashed everything in site,\u201d but because they had little alternative: They were not permitted to take their chairs and other items inside the facility, they were not allowed to go back to their cars to drop their items off before entering, they were not able to return to the area after the rally to claim items they left behind, and the number of available trash receptacles available outside the center was limited by Secret Service precautions.\n\nIn any event, the area was cleaned up fairly quickly, and leftover chairs and blankets were donated to local homeless shelters, according to this video posted to Facebook the day after the rally:", "lang": "en"}
