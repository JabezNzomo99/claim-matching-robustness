The story likely comes from a satire article published in 2014.\n\nFounded in 1846, the Smithsonian Institution is a large museum and research complex with 17 museums, galleries and a zoo in the Washington, D.C. area, according to its website. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show The Crowd At The \u2018Storm Area 51\u2019 Event?)\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than 100 times, claims that the Supreme Court ordered the Smithsonian to disclose that it destroyed giant human skeletons to \u201cprotect the mainstream chronology of human evolution.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller did not find any news reports of the Supreme Court ruling on such a case, and resources like the Supreme Court database turned up no matches either. The only two Supreme Court cases related to the museum complex \u2013 Smithsonian Institution v. St. John and Smithsonian Institution v. Meech \u2013 had nothing to do with evolution.\n\nThe story, debunked by Snopes in 2014, likely stems from an article on World News Daily Report, a site that publishes \u201csatirical\u201d and \u201cfictional\u201d content, according to its disclaimer. The article, entitled \u201cSmithsonian Admits To Destruction Of Thousands Of Giant Human Skeletons In Early 1900s,\u201d offers a similar but more detailed story of a supposed evolutionary cover-up.\n\nVarious hoaxes about the discovery of giant human remains have been circulating online since at least 2002, according to the National Geographic Society.", "lang": "en"}
