He listed out the changes made by Whatsapp consequent to a notice issued by the Union government but remarked that \u201cthese steps are not adequate.\u201d He added, \u201cThe government has issued a second notice to WhatsApp and it was conveyed to them at the highest levels that being a technological major company, it is their responsibility to come up with a technical solution when a harmful message is in wide circulation on the same day in a particular area on a particular issue. It is their obligation to inform the law enforcement agencies when they notice such messages,\u201d he said.\n\nBut even as the union minister took a tough stand against fake news and the responsibility of social media platforms, his response on fake news website Postcard being taken down by Facebook came as a surprise.\n\nReplying to TMC MP Derek O\u2019Brien\u2019s questions about BJP supporting Postcard, Prasad said, \u201cPost Card was removed by Facebook but there is no evidence of it propagating any ideology and it was reason for that.\u201d He further listed that fake and hoax news spread on websites are regularly monitored and taken down and till date 457 Facebook pages, 91 YouTube accounts and 321 Twitter pages have been taken down.\n\nEarlier, Derek O\u2019brien, Member of Parliament, All India Trinamool Congress posed four questions to Ravi Shankar Prasad, minister of Information Technology about spread of fake news and the action taken by the government. He made a direct attack on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party by accusing them of \u201ccreating a culture of digital mobs, used social media to condition minds, made fake news into their master hobby.\u201d\n\nHe then went on to talk about Facebook pulling down the page of fake news website Postcard News and calling the content of Postcard news \u201chundred percent right wing, RSS and BJP.\u201d Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu objected and said that the mention of RSS cannot be taken on record.\n\nO\u2019Brien asked, \u201cIf Facebook brought down Postcard news and we all know the content, then why are BJP MPs and MLAs now demanding that it should be brought back.\u201d He then asked about the funding behind Facebook page 'Nation with Namo' terming them Facebook\u2019s largest advertisers and also suggested that Whatsapp should be asked to disclose the top 1000 groups and who runs these groups.", "lang": "en"}
