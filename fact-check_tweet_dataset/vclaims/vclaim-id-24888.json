An image of the men\u2019s first court appearance has resurfaced in light of fresh claims from Zuma himself that he survived numerous assassination attempts. But the photograph does not, as some social media posts suggest, show recent events.\n\nIn one July 17 post, which we\u2019ve archived here, the image appears alongside a caption that reads: \u201cThese man are standing trail for plotting to Kill #JacobZuma & other senior ANC leaders. They appeared in court yesterday.The silence of Media is sickening.\u201d\n\nThe same photo, with a similar caption, can be found in this archived tweet from July 17 which was retweeted more than 900 times.\n\nHowever, a reverse image search for the picture shows that it dates back to December 18, 2012 when Johan Prinsloo, Hein Boonzaaier, Martin Keevy and Mark Trollip first appeared in court on charges related to treason and terrrorism for allegedly plotting to kill Zuma and other senior ANC members.\n\nYou can see the men wearing the same clothing in different pictures published by local media here and here in December 2012.\n\nAs reported by AFP, Prinsloo and Trollip were convicted of high treason for plotting to kill Zuma and sentenced to eight years in prison. Keevy was found mentally unfit to stand trial and charges against Boonzaaier were dropped due to insufficient evidence.\n\nPrinsloo became the last to be sentenced in November 2014, so the misleading post that claims \u201cthey appeared in court yesterday\u201d -- at the time of publication, July 16, 2019 -- is incorrect. It is also incorrect to claim that the media were silent on the matter as numerous articles were published between 2012 and 2014 following the men\u2019s court appearances.\n\nLast week Zuma dismissed multiple graft allegations against him, telling a judicial inquiry that he was the victim of conspiracies, years of \"character assassination\" and plots to kill him -- read AFP\u2019s report here.\n\nZuma is accused of overseeing mass looting of state assets during his nine-year tenure before being ousted by the ruling ANC party in 2018 and replaced by his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nZuma testified at the commission that he had survived many assassination attempts, from poison to a bid to kill him at a local music festival.", "lang": "en"}
