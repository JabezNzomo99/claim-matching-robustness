For the past five years, they have been unemployed.\u201d\n\nAt the time of filing this report, the above post was shared by over 400 Facebook users.\n\nALSO READ: Old picture of AR Rahman\u2019s daughter shared with misleading claims\n\nWe fact-checked the video and found it to be morphed.\n\nOn putting the keyframes of the video through a Google Reverse Image Search, we found the original link of the full speech on Indian National Congress\u2019 YouTube page.\n\nThe video in question here has been put together using sections from the original video in a misleading manner. Rahul Gandhi\u2019s original statement can be heard as: \u201cWhy are these bats hovering around here? How much do you think it costs to improve these dirty surroundings?\u201d\n\nAt an entirely different part in the video, Gandhi can be heard saying, that the youth of the country haven\u2019t found employment in the last five years. The morphed video, on the other hand, has cut and paste these sections from the original video as one.\n\nHence, it is clear that the video is a morphed one and hence is misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
