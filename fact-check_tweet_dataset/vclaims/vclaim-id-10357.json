And did he steal these pictures from mobile phones and computers owned by ordinary Americans via the NSA? No, that story is not true: it was made up by a site that regularilly makes up false stories, it was fake news.\n\nIt originally appeared on April 14, 2018 on the website World News Daily Report where it was titled \"FBI raid at NSA employee's home reveals over 4,000,000 \"dick pics\"\" (archived here). The story opened:\n\nFort Meade, MD | FBI agents have discovered an astounding 4,000,000 pictures of men's penises, also known as \"dick pics\", during a raid on an NSA employee's home this week. Federal prosecutors have charged Harry Muff, an NSA employee for 14 years, with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials. Muff's home was raided Wednesday by FBI agents who seized 14 computers containing 53 terabytes of illegally downloaded pictures and documents from the National Security Agency. It is believed Muff used his Top Secret security clearance to illegally download millions of pictures of sexual nature off of unsuspecting Americans mobile phones and computers.\n\nOn social media the story would have looked like a regular news article:\n\nBut the man in the picture illustrating the story is actually Hung Phuoc Nguyen, a 44-year-old man who was arrested for robbing a market stall and who was identified through possibly the worst police sketch ever:\n\nPut an APB out for Linus. Despite releasing a ridiculously bad hand-drawn portrait of a suspect, police in Pennsylvania believe they got their man. On Tuesday, the Lancaster Police Department published a description of a person who allegedly posed as an employee of a stand at the Central Market Mall, only to rob the stall and flee with an undisclosed sum of cash, Lancaster Online reports.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
