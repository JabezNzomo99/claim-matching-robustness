Although not all smokers develop lung discoloration, this is irrelevant to smoking\u2019s well-established link to an increased risk of disease, including lung cancer and emphysema\u2014which can in fact produce black discoloration. Smoking is responsible for 90% of lung cancer deaths and about 80% of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema, in the United States.\n\n\n\n A post titled \u201cThe black lung lie\u201d makes the claim that smoking does not necessarily cause lungs to discolor or turn black. Although the original post was published in 2012, it began trending on Facebook in November 2019, receiving more than 10,000 interactions.\n\nIn support of this claim, the author digs up quotes from physicians in the 1960s and 70s provided to U.S. tobacco industry giant R.J. Reynolds, which the company used in its argument at the time that smoking does not cause lung cancer. Testimonials from the physicians included: \u201cSmoking does not discolor the lung\u201d and \u201cit is not possible grossly or microscopically, or in any other way known to me, to distinguish between the lung of a smoker or a nonsmoker.\u201d\n\nWhile it is well known that \u201cnot every smoker develops chronic lung disease and that lung pathology differs markedly among smokers\u201d, as the authors of one study wrote[1], this claim ignores the well-established links between smoking and lung disease[2], including cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)[3][4][5], reduced lung function[6][7], heart disease, and an increased risk of stroke.\n\nLung disease such as emphysema can indeed cause black discoloration in the lungs[8], but not all smokers will develop emphysema. The author of the claim contends, therefore, that the association between \u201cblack lungs\u201d and smokers is a fallacy. However, this argument does nothing to support his claim and instead simply distracts from the very real dangers of tobacco smoking. Smoking causes about 90% of all lung cancer deaths and about 80% of all deaths from COPD in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Morse and Rosas.
