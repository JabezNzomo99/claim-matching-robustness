Then you went to school, your building schools for the future project, renewing our school buildings, stopped. You then got to further education, education maintenance allowance was taken away from you and then if you made it to university, your tuition fees were trebled. That isn\u2019t investing in young people, that is taking away from young people.\u201d\n\nChuka Umunna correctly identified a number of Coalition and Conservative government policies relating to young people and education. In some cases, where the government stopped a policy, they also replaced it with a new one. We take a look at each of the policies identified, and their impact, in further detail.\n\nThis is not meant to be a complete assessment of the Coalition and Conservative record on youth and education. Rather, it looks specifically at the areas picked out by Mr Umunna.\n\n508 children's centres closed in England between 2010 and August 2017, according to the government.\n\nThere were around 3,600 in 2010, compared to just over 3,100 late last year. You can\u2019t perfectly compare the number of children\u2019s centres in 2010 and 2017 though, due to changes in how the data is recorded.\n\nThere are two types of centre included in these figures. Sure Start centres provide childcare, family support and health advice to local families, and have to meet a legal definition, whereas other \u201cchildren\u2019s centres\u201d provide some of these services, but don\u2019t meet the legal definition.\n\nIn 2010, there were around 3,630 Sure Start centres. By late 2017, the number of Sure Start centres had fallen by around 1,200. The National Audit Office found that spending by councils in England on Sure Start fell by 50% in real terms from 2010/11 to 2016/17.\n\nThe Coalition government did end Labour\u2019s \u201cBuilding schools for the future programme\u201d (BSF) in 2010, although it replaced it with its own scheme: \u201cPriority School Building Programme\u201d (PSBP).\n\nAnnounced in 2003, Labour\u2019s BSF aimed \u201cto rebuild, refurbish and provide new Information Technology for all 3,500 secondary schools in England by 2020\u201d. In 2009 this was estimated to cost \u00a352 to \u00a355 billion.\n\nBy 2009, the National Audit Office reported that the speed of delivery would need to increase to complete the programme on time. \u201cFifty-four schools are due to open in 2009 and 121 in the following year. To start all secondary schools by 2020, the number of schools in procurement and construction at any one time will need to double over the next three years.\u201d\n\nIn July 2010, the Coalition government announced the project would be frozen \u201cIn order to ensure that we do not waste any more money on a dysfunctional process\u201d.\n\nThe Coalition government then announced its own programme (PSBP) in 2011. It aimed to rebuild and refurbish 537 \u201cschool buildings in the worst condition across the country\u201d by 2021, and was expected to cost \u00a34.4 billion in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, the National Audit Office found that on average schools built under the new programme \u201care one-third cheaper per square metre than schools built under\u201d the previous one. There were some reported concerns \u201cabout what the Department has done to reduce costs (for example, decreasing the size of communal spaces)\u201d.\n\nEducation Maintenance Allowance (EMA) was ended in England by the Coalition government at the end of the year 2010/11, and replaced by a new \u201c16 to 19 bursaries\u201d scheme. EMA is still available in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.\n\nIn England, EMA provided weekly grants to 16 to 18 year olds from low-income households, encouraging them to stay in education after the end of their compulsory years. In its final year these grants were worth \u00a310 to \u00a330 a week depending on household income.\n\nIn September 2011, the Coalition government replaced EMA with \u201c16 to 19 bursaries\u201d. These government-funded bursaries are \u201cdiscretionary\u201d, with schools broadly getting to decide which students are eligible, and how much to give them. Additionally, young people can receive a \u201cvulnerable student bursary\u201d of up to \u00a31,200 per year if they are or have been in care, or are in receipt of certain benefits.\n\nIn 2012/13, government-commissioned research estimated that around 360,000 students received a discretionary bursary, and 24,000 received a vulnerable student bursary. This compares to around 640,000 receiving EMA in 2009/10.\n\nWhen the 16 to 19 bursary fund was introduced in 2011/12, it cost \u201c\u00a3384 million less than the 2010/11 EMA in nominal terms\u201d.\n\nOverall, the research found that the new 16 to 19 bursaries lowered participation among students who would otherwise have received either full or partial EMA.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the Coalition government trebled the maximum cost of tuition fees for students starting higher education in England in 2011/12. They rose from a maximum of \u00a33,000, to \u00a39,000. The maximum is now \u00a39,250.\n\nYou can read more about the impact of this on access to higher education here.", "lang": "en"}
