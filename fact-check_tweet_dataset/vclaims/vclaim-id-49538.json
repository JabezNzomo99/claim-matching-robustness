The post doesn\u2019t explicitly mention what flag Modi was holding, however, the comment with the picture seems to suggest that the PM was waving an Islamic flag.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the image is morphed. The original photo is of PM Modi waving a plain green flag while inaugurating a train in Assam.\n\nThe viral photo was posted by Facebook page Bhashan Ya Rashan\u2019 on January 29.\n\nThe picture has received more than 8,500 reactions and was shared by around 1,200 users. The flag in the picture features a crescent moon and a star resembling an Islamic flag.\n\nThe archival version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe Hindi translation of the comment reads: He is showing his reality now. Fans, go die in shame.\n\nThe photo was actually clicked during the inauguration of the Bogibeel Bridge in Assam on December 25 last year. The prime minister was waving off the green flag while launching a train on the longest railroad bridge in the country.\n\nHere\u2019s the original image posted by Press Information Bureau from the event.\n\nThe original photo has a plain green flag in the hands of PM Modi, confirming that the crescent moon and star were superimposed on the misleading post.\n\nThis fake information was pointed out by a Twitter user on Thursday.\n\n\n\n Hence, the claim that PM Modi waving off an Islamic flag is totally false.", "lang": "en"}
