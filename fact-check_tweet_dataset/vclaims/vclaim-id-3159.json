It is.\n\nThe story sums up the general theory this way: \u201cThe New World Order wants to disarm the American people. That\u2019s why they created all of these hoax shootings.\u201d It goes on to say later, \u201cDon\u2019t give up your guns. After each one of these fake shootings go buy another gun.\u201d\n\nIt also features photos that were shared by one of the ringleaders of the Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists, Wolfgang Halbig. On Sept. 24, Halbig tweeted pictures of about a dozen smiling adolescents with the claim: \u201cHere are children who died at Sandy Hook live and well.\u201d He reposted one of the photos on Twitter again in December with the sign-off, \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nReached by phone on Feb. 27, Halbig said that the photos were emailed to him anonymously and that he believed they were sent by three of the students themselves.\n\nAlong with the suggestion that the families of the victims were all \u201ccrisis actors,\u201d the Facebook story claims that Adam Lanza, who shot himself after killing 26 in the school, was a \u201ccrisis actor.\u201d\n\nWithout any evidence, the story claims that the same person who \u201cplayed\u201d Adam Lanza also \u201cplayed\u201d the brother of Christina Grimmie, the pop singer who was shot dead in Orlando, Florida, while signing autographs in 2016.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nWashington Post staff. \u201cThe lives lost in the Parkland school shooting.\u201d The Washington Post. 19 Feb 2018.\n\n\u201cSandy Hook alleged victims alive and well!!!
