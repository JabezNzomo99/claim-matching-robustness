By 2020 it will have more than doubled to over \u00a315 billion a year... surely the government priority should be to look after the elderly, vulnerable and disabled people in our own country, before we hand money over to other countries?\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s overseas aid budget is rising steeply, although we can\u2019t replicate these precise figures. The aid budget isn\u2019t quite set to have \"more than doubled\" from 2010 to 2020\u2014and certainly not once inflation is factored in.\n\nThe overseas aid budget for 2010 was about \u00a38.5 billion. It had been \u00a37.3 billion in 2009.\n\nOverseas aid spending is based on a target of 0.7% of UK national income. So the amount we spend in 2020 will depend on how much the economy grows.\n\nWe\u2019d expect to spend about \u00a315.3 billion a year on overseas development aid in 2020, based on the latest economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility.\n\nThat\u2019s roughly 1.8 times what we spent in 2010, in cash terms.\n\nBut inflation means that the same amount of money will pay for less over time. We\u2019d expect our overseas aid budget in 2020 to be worth about \u00a313.1 billion in 2010 prices, based on the Treasury\u2019s forecasts for inflation.\n\nThat\u2019s roughly 1.5 times what we spent in 2010, in terms of what the money can buy.\n\nAnother approach would be thinking about what we can afford as an economy. In 2010, we spent about 0.57% of the value of the economy on overseas development aid. If the overseas aid target is still there in 2020, we\u2019ll spend 0.7%.\n\nThat would be closer to 1.2 times what we spent in 2010, as a percentage of our national income.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked Mr Davies which figures he was referring to.", "lang": "en"}
