Scott Walker brought the story of Megan Sampson, the first-year teacher who in 2010 lost her job in the Milwaukee Public Schools, back into the news.\n\nNow it\u2019s Walker critics who are keeping it there.\n\nIn a Jan. 24, 2015 appearance at an early 2016 presidential event in Iowa, Walker told the audience Sampson -- the \"outstanding teacher of the year in my state\" -- lost her job because of seniority provisions in the school district\u2019s contract with the teachers\u2019 union.\n\nIn a Feb. 15, 2015 column titled \"Scott Walker needs an eraser\", Gail Collins of the New York Times cited the story in criticizing Walker\u2019s education policies.\n\nIn the piece, Collins noted Walker\u2019s mistake in calling Sampson teacher of the year and wrote:\n\n\"All of that came as a distinct surprise to Claudia Felske, a member of the faculty at East Troy High School who actually was named a Wisconsin Teacher of the Year in 2010. In a phone interview, Felske said she still remembers when she got the news at a \u2018surprise pep assembly at my school.\u2019 As well as the fact that those layoffs happened because Walker cut state aid to education.\"\n\nThe last part caught our attention -- and that of others as well.\n\nIn short, Walker\u2019s policies had nothing to do with Sampson\u2019s layoff in 2010. At the time, he was in the midst of his successful campaign, but did not take office until January 2011.\n\nRather, MPS laid off a total of 482 teachers in June 2010 in response to a severe budget shortfall, in part tied to declining enrollment.\n\nCollins didn\u2019t respond to an email, but the Times posted a correction Feb. 15, 2015.\n\n\"An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated that teacher layoffs in Milwaukee in 2010 happened because Gov. Scott Walker \"cut state aid to education.\" The layoffs were made by the city\u2019s school system because of a budget shortfall, before Mr. Walker took office in 2011,\" the correction said.\n\nCollins said Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s policies were to blame for Milwaukee Public Schools teacher Megan Sampson being laid off. But Sampson lost her job in June 2010, six months before Walker took office.\n\nFor profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.", "lang": "en"}
