Figures provided to us by the think tank Volteface, which works on alternatives to current drug policies, also suggest this may be the case.\n\nVolteface released a report this month looking at children and cannabis. It looked at the change in the level of prosecutions and convictions for the cultivation, possession and supply of cannabis, and of possession with intent to supply over the last five years. It then broke these down by whether the individual involved was under or over the age of 18.\n\nLooking at prosecutions, the number of 10-17 year olds prosecuted for supplying cannabis over the last five years has increased, as the Times\u2019 claim states. Although the numbers of people involved are relatively small so small changes can affect how the trend looks a lot.\n\nAt the same time the number of adults being prosecuted for the same offence fell.\n\nOver the five years the number of prosecutions against young people increased by eight (or 15%) while the number against adults fell by almost 100 (or by 16%). Overall many more adults are being prosecuted than children, despite the fall in recent years.\n\n\n\nProsecutions against 10-17 year olds for possession with intent to supply also increased during that time, by 10, or 5%. There were around 690 fewer prosecutions against those aged 18 or over, a decrease of 22%.\n\nThe number of people prosecuted for all other cannabis charges fell during that time\u2014regardless of their age.\n\nConvictions for children aged 10-17 have increased over the five years for certain cannabis-related offences, such as supply and possession with intent to supply. The number of convictions for supplying cannabis against adults also increased in that time. For all the other offences looked at, the number found of people convicted fell, regardless of their age.\n\nAgain, the numbers of convictions each year are relatively small, so small changes year-on-year can exaggerate how trends look over time.\n\nBetween 2012/13 and 2016/17 the number of 10 to 17 year olds convicted of supplying cannabis went up by 11 (or 26%) and the number found guilty of possession with intent to supply increased by eight (or 5%). The number adults found guilty of supplying cannabis aged 18 or over also increased by eight (or by 1%).\n\nThe figures from Volteface, which originally came from the Ministry of Justice, may not show the complete picture as they only record the main offence that someone was prosecuted for or found guilty of. So if, for example, someone was facing a charge of supplying cannabis, but also a charge of murder, their cannabis charge wouldn\u2019t be recorded in the statistics.", "lang": "en"}
