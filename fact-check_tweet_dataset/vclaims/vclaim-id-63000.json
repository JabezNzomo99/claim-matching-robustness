This is false; the UN said there was no such condition, and abortion is already allowed under limited circumstances.\n\n\u201cUN Refuses to Send Coronavirus Funds to Pro-Life Nation Unless It Legalizes Abortions,\u201d read the headline of a May 18,2020 article on anti-abortion news website LifeNews.\n\nThe article went on to claim that \u201cthe United Nations is using coronavirus aid to pressure Ecuador to legalize the killing of unborn babies in abortions.\u201d\n\nThe preservation of access to sexual health services in Ecuador is included in the aid package, but the UN does not seek changes to the country\u2019s laws on abortion, officials told AFP.\n\nThe LifeNews article refers to an April 30 appeal from Ecuador\u2019s ministry of foreign relations for $46.4 million from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which has led the UN\u2019s international emergency response to the novel coronavirus.\n\nEcuador\u2019s application, accessible here in Spanish, outlines areas of need, including food safety, health, housing and education.\n\nThe government document includes the goal of maintaining the \u201ccontinuity of maternal, neonatal and children\u2019s health and other sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nEcuador also aims to raise awareness about the need for \u201csafe and legal access to abortion,\u201d the document says, which is what the online articles portray as the UN\u2019s condition for aid.\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that we are using the COVID\u201119 pandemic response as an opportunity to promote abortion is not correct,\u201d Zoe Paxton, a spokeswoman for OCHA in New York, told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cWhile we support healthcare that prevents millions of women from dying during pregnancy and childbirth and protects people from sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, we do not seek to override any national law.\u201d\n\nOn May 26, 2020, following publication of this fact check, LifeNews revised its article and changed the headline, after undertaking what it said was \"further investigation into the original claims groups made about the UN and the coronavirus relief plan.\"\n\nTo counter the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in \u201cfragile countries,\u201d the UN agency made a $6.7 billion appeal for its Global Humanitarian Response Plan, to be distributed to various countries according to their various humanitarian needs, including the $46.4 million to Ecuador.\n\nAbortion in Ecuador is only legal when the pregnancy constitutes a threat to a woman\u2019s life or health, or when it is the result of the rape of a mentally disabled woman.\n\nMario Naranjo, a UN spokesman in Ecuador, told AFP by email: \u201cThe plan only aims to apply national law, which allows safe abortion under two circumstances clearly defined in the Ecuadorian criminal code.\n\nThe response plan is not funded by the UN, but by voluntary contributions from governments. Funds cannot be withheld at the moment as the article claims, because only 15 percent of the money had been raised by May 20, according to Naranjo.\n\nIn any case, the money would not be given to the Ecuadorian government but rather to its Humanitarian Country Team and non-governmental organizations that are a part of it.\n\nThe original LifeNews article followed a May 17 piece from the Catholic News Agency headlined: \u201cIn Ecuador, pro-life groups protest U.N. abortion conditions on coronavirus aid.\u201d\n\nHector Lepez, a member of parliament in Ecuador, was one of the first to denounce the \u201cconditions\u201d for OCHA\u2019s aid package, in a Facebook post featuring the response plan\u2019s goals in regard to sexual health.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 460 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
