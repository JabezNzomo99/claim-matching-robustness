The bus was flagged off on Independence Day by the Governor of Goa who took a drive to Raj Bhavan in it. There was however one small problem with the announcement. As per media reports, India\u2019s first biogas bus was already launched in Kolkata in April this year.\n\nMake In India official handle also announced that India\u2019s first biogas buses, by Scania, are on the streets of Goa.\n\nMake In India provided a link to a Times of India article which elaborated that the \u201cGoa government launched India\u2019s first biogas-run bus as a pilot project on the occasion of Independence Day today. They intend to have approximately 40 such buses in the state by February 2018 which will run on the eco-friendly fuel.\u201d\n\nIn April this year, the same newspaper (Times of India) had announced the first biogas bus in Kolkata with flat Re 1 fare.\n\nThe same was also reported by others like Hindustan Times, Deccan Herald, Indian Express and NDTV. They reported that the initiative was undertaken under a central subsidies plan of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. The buses were built in Delhi using Tata Motors chassis. Asian age had published a picture of the biogas bus launched in Koklata.\n\nJyoti Prakash Das, Chairman and Managing Director of Phoenix India Research & Development Group, told NDTV \u201cWe are the first one to launch biogas bus in the entire south east Asia. Now old buses which have run for 15 or 20 years, can also be given a fresh lease of life with this clean and cheap fuel, and we are in the process of seeking government approval for the same.\u201d\n\nGovernment of India encourages biofuels i.e. biogas, biodiesel and bioethanol. India\u2019s first ethanol-run buses were launched in Nagpur in August 2014. On the lines of ethanol, Nagpur Municipal Corporation had also started the process to launch the nation\u2019s first biogas and biodiesel city buses. In July 2017, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) launched India\u2019s first biodiesel buses. If we are to go by media reports, India\u2019s first biogas bus was launched in Kolkata in April, 2017 and not in Goa.\n\nHowever, confusion still remains about India\u2019s first biogas bus. Parrikar\u2019s tweet and media reports on launch of the Goa biogas bus contradict the earlier media reports about the Kolkata biogas bus being India\u2019s first biogas bus. It is surprising that sections of media that carried the story about the launch of India\u2019s first biogas bus in April did not bother to check and clarify before running another story with the same claim in August.", "lang": "en"}
