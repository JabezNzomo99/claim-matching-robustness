No, that's not true: The 2012 Republican presidential candidate and business executive did have cancer years earlier, but he beat it. He died after testing positive for coronavirus and being hospitalized for nearly a month, according to HermanCain.com. The editor of Cain's website confirmed in an email message to Lead Stories: \"Herman died of COVID-19. 100 percent. Nothing else.\"\n\nThe bogus claim appeared as a meme in posts like this one (archived here) which published on Facebook on July 30, 2020, under the title \"Herman Cain died WITH COVID-19 not OF it.\" The post opened:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nPlenty other posts echoed this coronavirus-killed-him skeptism and spread similar misinformation.\n\nThis is how that post appeared on social media:\n\n\"Why do they leave this out?\" wrote another person on Facebook, before posting a meme that read:\n\nThis is how that post appeared:\n\nAnd yet another person wrote this in his post: \"Media forgot to mention Herman Cain had Stage-4 colon cancer. Everything COVID?\"\n\nHere's what that post looked like:\n\nThe day it was announced on Cain's official Twitter account that he had tested positive, the fact that he had beaten Stage 4 cancer was highlighted in the attached memo, which posted on July 2, 2020, and read:\n\nOn Monday, June 29, Herman Cain was informed that he had tested positive for COVID-19. By Wednesday, July 1, Mr. Cain had developed symptoms serious enough that he required hospitalization. He spent the past night in the hospital and as of today, Thursday, July 2, he is resting comfortably in an Atlanta-area hospital. Mr. Cain did not require a respirator, and he is awake and alert. There is no way of knowing for sure how or where Mr. Cain contracted the coronavirus, but we do know he is a fighter who has beaten Stage 4 cancer. With God's help, we are confident he will make a quick and complete recovery, and will soon resume hosting The Herman Cain Show at HermanCain.com, and Herman Cain's America on NewsmaxTV. Please join with us in praying for Mr. Cain, and for everyone who has contracted the coronavirus -- as well as their families.\n\nHere's how the memo was introduced and appeared:\n\nThe longtime editor of HermanCain.com, Dan Calabrese, shared news of Cain's passing early on the morning of July 30th in an article titled, \"We're heartbroken, and the world is poorer: Herman Cain has gone to be with the Lord.\"\n\nCalabrese went on in the piece to describe what took the life of Cain, whom he described as \"our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us.\" Here's what Calabrese wrote:\n\nLet me deal with some of the particulars of the last few weeks. We knew when he was first hospitalized with COVID-19 that this was going to be a rough fight. He had trouble breathing and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. We all prayed that the initial meds they gave him would get his breathing back to normal, but it became clear pretty quickly that he was in for a battle. We didn't release detailed updates on his condition to the public or to the media because neither his family nor we thought there was any reason for that. There were hopeful indicators, including a mere five days ago when doctors told us they thought he would eventually recover, although it wouldn't be quick. We were relieved to be told that, and passed on the news via Herman's social media. And yet we also felt real concern about the fact that he never quite seemed to get to the point where the doctors could advance him to the recovery phase.\n\nLead Stories reached out to Calabrese directly to make sure cancer played no role in the loss of his longtime friend and boss. Here's what Calabrese had to say in an emailed response:\n\nAs news reports came out about his death due to complications of coronavirus, plenty of outlets mentioned Cain's previous battle with cancer. This part of his life was far from ignored.\n\nAn in-depth video interview on Fox News about Cain's passing explored the cause of his death, and the sadness about the loss, further.
