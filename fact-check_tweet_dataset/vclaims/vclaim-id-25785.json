Singh posted this picture and message on his Twitter account which has been retweeted over 170 times.\n\nOn Facebook, the page I am with Ravish Kumar too has posted this image with the aforementioned claim. It has been shared a whopping 31,000 times already.\n\nThe image is not from UP as claimed by Digvijaya Singh but from Andhra Pradesh. Sakshi TV, which is a Telugu news channel, had reported on September 22 how ambulances at Avutupalli near Vijaywada were lying unused.\n\nAccording to the news report, the ambulances are idle because of lack of maintenance on the part of the agency which has been awarded the contract by the Andhra Pradesh government. Alt News spoke to Raja Ramesh, reporter of Sakshi TV who filed the report from Vijaywada. \u201c(The ambulances) seen in the photo are old 108 ambulances which were not used as BVG, the agency tasked with maintenance and service has not allotted the requisite funds.\n\nIf one looks closely at the image posted by Digvijaya Singh, it can be seen that the ambulances are from Andhra Pradesh. At the bottom right of the screen, the words \u2018Government of Andhra Pradesh\u2019 can be read on the green band on the vehicle. However, this image is relatively blurred. The image posted on the website of Sakshi TV is clearer and the words can be read easily.\n\nPolitical propaganda on social media is rampant, relentless and often economical with the truth. A closer look at the image reveals that the claim circulating on social media is false. While Digvijaya Singh relishes taking potshots at the BJP, he has been caught on the wrong foot in this instance.", "lang": "en"}
