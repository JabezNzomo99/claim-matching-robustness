Because it\u2019s not been told to them yet. I don\u2019t know about you, but home constituency doesn\u2019t understand that.

I still believe my vote was just \u2014 but the president\u2019s use of that authority was unwise in ways I never imagined.\u201d opinion article in the New Republic : \u201cA year and a half ago, I voted to give President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq. I still believe my vote was just \u2014 but the president\u2019s use of that authority was unwise in ways I never imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cVice President Biden misspoke by saying that he declared his opposition to the war immediately. He opposed the way we went to war and the way the war was being carried out. He has for many years called his vote a mistake and takes full responsibility for it. The Bush Administration assured then-Senator Biden that the purpose of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force was to strengthen our position at the U.N. Security Council to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq, and that diplomacy would be exhausted without a premature rush to war. The U.N. element of this strategy worked: after Congress passed the AUMF, the Security Council voted 15-0 to send the inspectors back and Saddam gave them access. However, the Bush Administration plunged the nation into war anyway, without allowing the inspectors to finish their job \u2014 which was profoundly misguided. Once the war began, then-Senator Biden was immediately clear in his opposition to how we got into the conflict and the way it was being conducted \u2014 including the failure to exhaust diplomacy or enlist allies, the reliance on and hyping of faulty intelligence, and the absence of a viable plan to win the peace. He was adamant that, however misguided the war, we owed it to our troops to support them, and he fought for investments like MRAPs [Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles] that saved hundreds of lives from IEDs.\u201d\n\nYes, Biden was critical of how the war was managed and the reasons it was waged, and thus he would be on more solid ground if he simply called himself a war critic. Yet for more than a year he repeatedly defended his vote to authorize an invasion as \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cright.\u201d Even when he finally said in 2005 that the vote was a mistake, he again faulted Bush for how he waged the war, not the decision to start it in the first place. Not until 2008, when he was Obama\u2019s running mate, did he forthrightly say the war should not have been fought.", "lang": "en"}
