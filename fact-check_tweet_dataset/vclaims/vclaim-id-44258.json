Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nWhen the image is subjected to reverse image search technique, a link of \u2018Internet Movie Database\u2019 (IMDb) was obtained in the search results. It is related to the movie \u2018Nine Hours to Rama (1963)\u2019. The image was found in the photo gallery of that movie. The movie is about Nathuram Godse\u2019s plan to kill Mahatma Gandhi and the task of a police officer, Gopal Das, to find the killer before it\u2019s too late. \n\n\n\nThe movie \u2018Nine Hours to Rama\u2019 was found on YouTube and a still in it, at 1:55:32, is similar to that of the viral photograph. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, a still from a movie is falsely shared as \u2018Rare picture of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s murder by Nathuram Godse\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
