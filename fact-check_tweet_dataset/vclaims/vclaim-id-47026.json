The claim originated from an article published on a satire website.\n\nSocial media platforms are often replete with misinformation about politicians. In this case, Facebook users have shared a screen grab that purportedly shows mugshots of the former president along with the phrase \u201cFederal Court Rules Obama Can Be Charged as a Terrorist.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence to corroborate the claim, however. A court ruling involving a former president would have been covered extensively by media outlets, yet no credible reports could be found. The only match was an article, titled \u201cFederal Court Rules Obama Can Be Charged as a Terrorist,\u201d from the website Obama Watcher.\n\n\u201cThe 13th Federal Court of Writs and Warrants has cleared the path for Barack Hussein Obama to be tried for treason,\u201d reads the article. \u201cAccording to the unanimous three-judge ruling, if private citizen Barack Obama committed crimes, he can be prosecuted, regardless of his position when he held them.\u201d\n\nThe 13th Federal Court of Writs and Warrants does not appear to exist. Obama Watcher is a parody website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d Yet, while Obama Watcher disclaims the satirical nature of its content, the screen grab being shared on Facebook fails to include a similar warning, portraying the information as factual.

In May, social media users shared a debunked claim that President Donald Trump sent Obama a bill to \u201crepay the government\u201d for vacations that weren\u2019t official state business.", "lang": "en"}
