No excuses.\"\u200b\n\nThe posts appear to be mocking Trump\u2019s much commented on (here) use of Twitter, in addition to his frequent typos, some notorious examples of which can be seen here and here .\u200b\n\nSome posts spreading this screenshot on social media date back to February 2018, see here and here. \u200b\n\nThe image recently re-surfaced on social media as the Dow Jones experienced one of its most dramatic declines in years, as fears over the spread of the coronavirus continue to grow (see here). On February 24, 2020, hours after the Dow tumbled, Trump tweeted that the coronavirus was under control in the United States, adding that the stock market was \u201cstarting to look very good to me!\u201d (see here)\u200b\n\nTrump has verifiably tweeted about the Dow Jones in the past, see here and here, but an advanced query on Twitter gives no results for Tweets with the words \u201cDow Joans\u201d or any other phrase in the screenshot on social media that could with certainty be attributed to Trump\u2019s official Twitter account.\u200b\n\nThe twitter user Shaun Usher (@ShaunUsher) recently confirmed that this tweet was fake by stating: \"Tell you what. My inboxes are getting an absolute hammering at the moment. Wave upon wave of spittle. Don\u2019t create fake tweets!\"\u200b while embedding the tweet in this claim (see here).\n\nFalse: Trump did not tweet that if the \u201cDow Joans\u201d plunged, the President should be shot out of a cannon. This is a fake tweet.", "lang": "en"}
