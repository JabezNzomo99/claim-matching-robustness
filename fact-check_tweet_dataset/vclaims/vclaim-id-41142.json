The video has garnered 68,000 views and over 1,100 shares at the time of writing this article. It is noteworthy that the video is being shared amidst Navratri celebrations when garba is played especially in the western state of Gujarat.\n\nA Facebook user also shared the video with an identical claim.\n\nThe same video has been floating online since 2017. Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry Kiran Bedi had tweeted the video on October 20, 2017. She too claimed that the elderly woman was Hiraben Modi and wrote, \u201cSpirit of Deepavali at tender age of 97.\u201d\n\nA keyword search on YouTube leads one to the same video uploaded by numerous users. The earliest instance of the video was traced back to September 30, 2017, uploaded with the caption, \u201cGarba fever.\u201d\n\nAlt News had debunked this video when it was shared by Bedi two years ago. Bedi had tweeted a clarification after several social media users pointed out the misinformation.\n\nA facial comparison of the elderly woman and Hiraben Modi also stands as evidence that the one dancing in the video is not the PM\u2019s mother. Hiraben Modi\u2019s face is circular while the other woman has an oval face structure. Moreover, Hiraben Modi is seen wearing spectacles in all her publically available photographs, even the ones shot at home.\n\nA video of a random elderly woman has been circulating on social media with the false claim that she is Prime Minister Modi\u2019s mother Hiraben.", "lang": "en"}
