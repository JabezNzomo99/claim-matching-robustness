In a 2009 book, the management consultant Peter Drucker was quoted as saying, \u201cYou cannot predict the future, but you can create it.\u201d\n\nIlya Prigogine, recipient of the 1977 Nobel Prize in chemistry, apparently said, \u201cThe way to cope with the future is to create it.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator has tracked down these and other variations of the phrase, none of which credibly belong to the nation\u2019s 16th president.\n\nThe statement appears nowhere in his collected writings, according to Daniel Worthington, director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln. \u201cI am not familiar with the quote, and I could not find it in any of our documents, so I have my doubts Lincoln said it,\u201d he told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\nThe saying may have originated with Dennis Gabor, the physicist who won the 1971 Nobel Prize for inventing holography. \u201cThe future cannot be predicted, but futures can be invented,\u201d he wrote in a 1963 book. \u201cIt was man\u2019s ability to invent which has made human society what it is.\u201d\n\nAlan Kay, the former chief scientist of Atari, is credited with the particular wording found in the Facebook post.", "lang": "en"}
