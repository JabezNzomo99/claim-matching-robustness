In the video, the woman is seen to be severely injured. Through this article lets fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Hindu extremist group attacked a Muslim woman doctor accusing that her community is responsible for spreading coronavirus in India. Fact: The woman is neither a doctor nor the group which attacked her is affiliated to any Hindu extremist group. The video shows attack on NGO volunteers who are empanelled by North Delhi Municipal Corporation to sterilize street dogs. The attackers were locals of Rani Bagh, Outer Delhi. The video of this incident is being quoted out of context attributing a communal angle to the attack. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIf we carefully watch the video, nowhere in the video, she said that she is a doctor and she never claimed that a Hindu extremist group has attacked them. We can hear the woman saying that her name is Ayesha and their team has been beaten up by a mob while they were trying to sterilize dogs and they were at Azadpur police station to lodge a complaint.\n\nWhen we ran a search on the internet about the incident, we found many newspaper articles reporting the incident. From one such newspaper article, we found that the woman and her team volunteer for an NGO called Neighborhood Woof and their NGO is empanelled with the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to sterilize the street dogs. In one such sterilization drive in Rani Bagh in Outer Delhi, they were attacked by the locals. Nowhere in the article, it is mentioned that the attack was carried by a Hindu extremist group or that there was a communal angle to the incident. Newspaper articles regarding the same can be seen here and here. With these clues, we can safely conclude that the injured woman in the video is not a doctor and the mob which attacked her is not affiliated to any Hindu extremist group.\n\nOn their Facebook page Neighborhood Woof, the team explained the whole incident on how they were misjudged as child kidnappers and got attacked by the locals. Also, they cleared the air regarding the rumours being spread. This clarification video can be watched here.\n\nThe same viral post is debunked by other fact-checking websites and those articles can be seen here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, an attack on volunteers of an NGO is being quoted out of context attributing a communal angle.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
