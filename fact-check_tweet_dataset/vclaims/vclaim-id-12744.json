How come Imelda won every corruption case that was thrown to her?\u201d\n\nThe 4-year-old post has more than 331,000 shares, more than 38,000 comments, and more than 369,000 reactions as of this posting. It has been shared again publicly by some Facebook users in recent days.\n\nThe facts: Imelda did not win every corruption case thrown at her. Apart from losing the recent criminal case at the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan, she lost in a number of local and overseas cases involving the loot she and her husband, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, amassed during their rule from 1965 to 1986.\n\nIn 2003, the Supreme Court allowed the forfeiture of the money \u2013 which by then had grown to over $658 million due to interests and other accrued amounts as of January 2002 \u2013 in favor of the Philippine government.\n\nThe recent Sandiganbayan decision found former First Lady and current Ilocos Norte Representative Imelda Marcos guilty of 7 counts of graft over illegally creating and maintaining private Swiss foundations, where the couple earned at least $200 million from interests and investments \"for the sole benefit\" of the former first family. (READ: Imelda Marcos verdict shows scheme to earn $200M from Swiss foundations)\n\nAsked about the claim that previous presidents were not able to pin down the Marcoses in a corruption case, lawyer and former Supreme Court spokesperson Theodore Te told Rappler: \"I think the answer lies in the length of time the cases took. This [recent] case versus Imelda wasn't won by a president, it started with previous presidents.\"\n\nRappler previously analyzed data on long pending cases lodged with the Sandiganbayan. We noted that, with respect to this particular case, both government prosecutors and the Marcoses\u2019 defense teams share the blame. Both camps took turns asking the Supreme Court to intervene at various points in the proceedings. (READ: What are the Sandiganbayan's oldest pending cases?)", "lang": "en"}
