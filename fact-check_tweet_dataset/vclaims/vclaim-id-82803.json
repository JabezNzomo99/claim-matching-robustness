Many of them do not have designs on attacking the West or attacking the United States, and that is what puts them in stark contrast to the goals and capability of the previously existing al-Qaeda core network that was led by Osama bin Laden.\u201d\n\nSeveral readers asked us to examine this claim from White House spokesman Josh Earnest that President Obama was not singling out the group that now calls itself as Islamic State when, during in an interview with the New Yorker that appeared last January, he appeared to dismiss it as a \u201cJV squad.\u201d Since then, the group has taken over vast segments of Iraqi territory, declared itself a state and has posted videos that appear to show the beheadings of two American journalists.\n\nThe New Yorker article, written by David Remnick, appeared in the Jan. 27, 2014, issue. It was clearly based on a series of interviews with the president, over a period of months, but the interview in question took place in the Oval Office on Jan. 7, according to the previously unreleased transcript obtained by The Fact Checker.\n\nThe date is important because just four days before, newspapers reported that the Islamic State had captured and raised its flag over Fallujah, where Marines in 2004 had fought one of the bloodiest battles of the U.S. invasion. As Liz Sly of The Washington Post reported:\n\nA rejuvenated al-Qaeda-affiliated force asserted control over the western Iraqi city of Fallujah on Friday, raising its flag over government buildings and declaring an Islamic state in one of the most crucial areas that U.S. troops fought to pacify before withdrawing from Iraq two years ago\u2026. The upheaval also affirmed the soaring capabilities of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the rebranded version of the al-Qaeda in Iraq organization that was formed a decade ago to confront U.S. troops and expanded into Syria last year while escalating its activities in Iraq.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, but, David, I think the analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn\u2019t make them Kobe Bryant. I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: But let\u2019s just keep in mind, Fallujah is a profoundly conservative Sunni city in a country that, independent of anything we do, is deeply divided along sectarian lines. And how we think about terrorism has to be defined and specific enough that it doesn\u2019t lead us to think that any horrible actions that take place around the world that are motivated in part by an extremist Islamic ideology is a direct threat to us or something that we have to wade into.\n\nThe president\u2019s \u201cJV\u201d comment was so striking that Remnick, in his article, referred to it as \u201can uncharacteristically flip analogy.\u201d The New Yorker article does not specifically refer to ISIS, but it is fairly clear in the article \u2014 and certainly clear in the transcript \u2014 that Remnick was asking about its takeover of Fallujah.\n\nIn the White House briefing, Earnest asserted that Obama was referring to groups that \u201cdo not have designs on attacking the West or on attacking the United States \u2026 they certainly don\u2019t have the capability of attacking the West.\u201d He told reporters that \u201cit\u2019s important that we don\u2019t sort of shorthand the analogy that the president was trying to draw here,\u201d in that the president was referring to \u201cjihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes.\u201d\n\nBut the context of Remnick\u2019s question makes it clear that he was asking about ISIS, as the president acknowledged. Perhaps at the time the president viewed it as a local matter between jihadists, but now, eight months later, the United States is striking Islamic State targets in an effort to turn back its advance across Iraqi territory.\n\nWith the passage of eight months, the president\u2019s \u201cJV\u201d comment looks increasingly untenable, so we can understand why the White House spokesman would try to suggest that what is now known as the Islamic State was not the subject of the conversation.\n\nBut in quoting from the transcript, Earnest provided a selective reading of the discussion. In particular, he failed to provide the context in which Obama made his remarks \u2014 the takeover of Fallujah by ISIS. That\u2019s fairly misleading. The interviewer was certainly asking about ISIS when Obama answered with his \u201cJV\u201d remarks.", "lang": "en"}
