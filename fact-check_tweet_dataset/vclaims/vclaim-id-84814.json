I want to start with that and ask you, in light of the interview, in light of the questions he had problems with, do you believe this morning that Bernie Sanders is qualified and ready to be president of the United States?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think the interview raised a lot of really serious questions and I look at it this way. The core of his campaign has been break up the banks and it didn\u2019t seem in reading his answers that he understood exactly how that would work under Dodd-Frank, exactly who would be responsible, what the criteria were. And you know, that means you can\u2019t really help people if you don\u2019t know how to do what you are campaigning on saying you want to do.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: So is he \u2014 so is he \u2026\n\nCLINTON: And then there were other very \u2026\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Is he \u2014 I know there are a lot of examples of where he came up short and the interviewers were having to repeat questions. So the question, and I\u2019m serious, if you weren\u2019t running today and you looked at Bernie Sanders, would you say this guy is ready to be president of the United States?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think he hadn\u2019t done his homework, and he\u2019d been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn\u2019t really studied or understood, and that does raise a lot of questions. And really what it goes to is for voters to ask themselves can he deliver what he\u2019s talking about, can he really help people \u2026\n\nSCARBOROUGH: What do you think?\n\nCLINTON: Can he help our economy? Can he keep our country strong? Well obviously, I think I\u2019m by far the better choice and \u2026\n\nSCARBOROUGH: But do you think he is qualified? And do you think he is able to deliver on the things he is promising to all these Democratic voters?\n\nCLINTON: Well, let me put it this way, Joe. I think that what he has been saying about the core issue in his whole campaign doesn\u2019t seem to be rooted in an understanding of either the law or the practical ways you get something done. And I will leave it to voters to decide who of us can do the job that the country needs, who can do all aspects of the job, both on the economic domestic issues and on national security and foreign policy.", "lang": "en"}
