These posts typically included a brief piece of text followed by a hyperlink as shown below:\n\nWhile reading this message may give the impression that FEMA is offering hazard pay to workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, those who clicked on the link were quickly made aware that this post was just a joke.\n\nThe link in the above-displayed message, for instance, does not direct readers to a page on the official FEMA website about hazard pay. Rather, this link directs readers to an image of a gorilla who appears to be holding up its middle finger:\n\nWhile the above-displayed message was circulated as a pointed joke (the point being, it seems, that FEMA should be providing hazard pay to workers), the COVID-19 pandemic has provided ample opportunities for misinformation to spread online. FEMA has added a \u201crumor control\u201d page to its website in order to address some of this misinformation. This page begins by informing readers that they can do \u201cthree easy things\u201d to stop the spread of false information:\n\nFEMA helps the public distinguish between rumors and facts regarding the response to coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Do your part to the stop the spread of rumors by doing three easy things: Find trusted sources of information.\n\n Share information from trusted sources.\n\n Discourage others from sharing information from unverified sources. To find trusted sources, look for information from official public health and safety authorities. You can find many official sources at coronavirus.gov. Check your state and local government or emergency management websites and social media accounts for trusted information specific to your area.", "lang": "en"}
