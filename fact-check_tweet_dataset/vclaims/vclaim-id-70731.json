Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez said so during the of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics, Perez said, \"just came out with their data on union membership. \u2026 If you have a union job, you're making on average $950 a week. If you have a non-union job, you're making $750 a week. So collective bargaining is a big part of how this middle class grew in America and it continues to be an important part of who we are as Americans.\"\n\nWe located the report Perez was talking about. In , BLS summarizes median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers in 2012 and 2013 by whether they are in a union or not.\n\nThe table shows that the median weekly earnings for union members in 2013 was $950, compared to $750 for non-union workers.\n\nSo Perez is basically right, with one exception. He should have referred to median earnings, rather than average earnings. A median takes the exact middle value from a list that\u2019s ordered from biggest to smallest, rather than taking the sum of all earnings and dividing it by the number of people. The two calculations usually aren\u2019t the same; a median is less likely to be skewed by very small or very large values.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s worth pointing out a few other bits of context, none of which make Perez\u2019s claim less accurate.\n\u2022 This is an overall median; the ratios by occupation differ. In some sectors, being a union member doesn\u2019t matter much, . In several sectors -- including \"management, professional, and related occupations,\" \"financial activities,\" \"professional and technical services,\" \"sales and related occupations,\" \"mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction,\" and the federal government -- non-union workers actually earn modestly more than union members do. And union members earn only marginally more than non-union workers in such fields as \"telecommunications\" and \"arts, entertainment, and recreation.\"\n\nBy contrast, the biggest gaps come in fields such as \"protective service occupations\" (a difference of $459 a week) and \"construction\" (a difference of $383 a week). Protective service occupations includes correctional officers, police, firefighters, animal control workers, lifeguards, and security guards.\n\n\"Unions do more to raise the wages of workers with less-than-average education than they do to boost the wages of those with better-than-average education,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. \"Unionized Ph.D.s do not gain as much from being in a union as high school dropouts, though even unionized Ph.D.s may enjoy a bit better job security and receive bigger helpings of health and retirement benefits than their non-union counterparts.\"\n\u2022 If you include fringe benefits, the difference between union members and non-union workers grows.\n\nAccording to , workers\u2019 pay plus benefts for a 40-hour week was $1,508 for a union employee and $1,083 for a non-union worker. That\u2019s a gap of $425 -- more than double the gap in the figures cited by Perez.\n\n\"Unions are typically more successful in getting good fringe benefits \u2013 especially health benefits, sickness pay, and retirement benefits \u2013 than in raising workers\u2019 money wages,\" Burtless said.\n\nPerez said. \"If you have a union job, you're making on average $950 a week. If you have a non-union job, you're making $750 a week.\"\n\nHis figures are correct, but with an asterisk -- Perez should have specified \"median\" when he said \"average.\" In general, though, his overall point is backed up by the data. We rate his claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
