But the claim is false; the newspaper in the photo is the Independent Observer, an English-language Indonesian newspaper based in Cibinong, a town near the capital Jakarta.\n\nThe photo was shared here in a Facebook post in a group with more than 100,000 members on March 22, 2019 and has been shared more than 400 times.\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s caption translates to English as: \u201cHooray\u2026. Finally, a foreign newspaper reports \u2018Jokowi as a liar\u2019... That\u2019s savage. I don\u2019t know if Jokowi\u2019s supporters would dare to comment on this.\u201d\n\n\u2018Jokowi\u2019 refers to Indonesian president Joko Widodo\u2019s popular nickname. Widodo is running for reelection in April elections against challenger Prabowo Subianto. Here is an AFP story about the upcoming polls.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe image shows the front page of a newspaper with the title \u201cIndependent Observer\u201d.\n\nThe text below the newspaper\u2019s name reads: \u201cJakarta - Indonesia\u201d.\n\nThe claim that the photo shows a foreign newspaper is false; the Independent Observer describes itself as, and is registered in an official government database as, an Indonesian newspaper.\n\nOn the paper's Facebook page, which can be seen here, the Independent Observer describes itself as: \"Indonesian weekly newspaper that covers general interest topic with a particular emphasis on Indonesian politic & culture.\"\n\nThe same front page story as appears in the image in the misleading post was published on its website here on August 10, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the online report:\n\nThe headline in the online report and the newspaper\u2019s logo are the same as that in the front page story in the misleading post.\n\nAccording to the official records for the Independent Observer on this page for the government-run Indonesian Science Institute (LIPI), which keeps an official database of Indonesian publications, the paper is Indonesian.\n\nThe LIPI page states the Independent Observer is a \u201cnational newspaper that uses English language\u201d that is based in Cibinong, a town near Indonesia\u2019s capital of Jakarta.", "lang": "en"}
