He first suggested that Pence \u2014 \u201cdoing his best to lift them\u201d \u2014 was pretending to strain as he took boxes off a cart. \u201cSince it was going so well and also because he didn\u2019t realize he had a mic on, Magic Mike decided to keep it going,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cListen in closely here.\u201d\n\nPence is heard being told the remaining boxes are empty, and he responds: \u201cWell, can I carry the empty ones? Just for the camera?\u201d\n\nKimmel asserted, \u201cMike Pence pretending to carry a big box of PPEs into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he\u2019s doing: a big box of nothing, delivering another box of nothing.\u201d\n\nKimmel tweeted out the clip Friday morning, saying: \u201cA big box of nothing, delivering another box of nothing.\u201d It quickly went viral, accumulating millions of views. For instance:\n\nBut this was manipulated video, as Washington Post producer Peter Stevenson noted after viewing the original C-SPAN video. (Go to the nine-minute mark.) Pence\u2019s comment about the empty boxes is greeted with laughter. A man helping Pence unload the van jokes: \u201cThey\u2019re a lot easier,\u201d eliciting more laughter from Pence and the others.\n\nKimmel at first deleted the tweet without explanation. (We sought comment from Disney \u2014 the owner of ABC, which airs Kimmel\u2019s show \u2014 but did not get a response.) Then he posted an apology of sorts.\n\nKimmel is a comedian, but he still should be careful about perpetuating a narrative that the media peddles \u201cfake news.\u201d This was certainly a phony tale, and it can undercut accurate and dogged reporting by real reporters.\n\nThis is a clear case of manipulated video, according to our guide. It is an example of \u201cdeceptive editing-omission.\u201d\n\nHe has deleted his tweet and offered apologies. Otherwise he would have been in line for Four Pinocchios.\n\nUpdate, May 12: Kimmel publicly apologized to his viewers on May 11, saying he was \u201cwrong\" to share the clip, which came via Democratic operative: \u201cI didn\u2019t know because I\u2019d only watched part of the video. Turns out there were 29 minutes of this on C-SPAN that apparently indicate he was joking about carrying the empty boxes for the cameras, which again, I didn\u2019t know because I do not have the mental endurance it requires to watch Mike Pence deliver boxes for 29 minutes on C-SPAN,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I should have watched the whole thing, I guess. Bottom line is, I was wrong. Apologizing to the Trump administration for spreading untruth is like apologizing to Barry Bonds for using steroids. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker is working with the CoronaVirusFacts/DatosCoronaVirus Alliance, a coalition of more than 100 fact-checkers who are fighting misinformation related to the covid-19 pandemic.
