The claim on Kenya\u2019s global e-commerce ranking was incorrect. \n\n\n\nOn 13 June 2019 Kenya\u2019s finance minister Henry Rotich announced his budget for the 2019/20 financial year, which starts on 1 July.\n\n(about US$27.5 billion) over the year.\n\nHis speech included claims on Kenya\u2019s economic growth, public service wages, government tenders and e-commerce readiness.\n\nBut were the claims on the money? We checked.\n\nKenya\u2019s economic data is recorded by the\n\nthat real GDP (which accounts for inflation) grew 6.3% in 2018.\n\nThe actual growth figure will be confirmed in the next economic survey, to be released in the second quarter of 2020. But an Africa Check\n\nGDP growth data since 2013 shows revised figures have been very close to the provisional figure.\n\nthat the Kenyan economy grew 4.9% in 2017. The statistics office\n\nthis lower growth rate was due to \u201cuncertainty associated with a prolonged electioneering period coupled with adverse effects of weather conditions\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Rotich chose eight years, although this puts back the clock to 2010, when Kenya\n\na new constitution. This was after political violence following a disputed election in 2007\n\nCharting the country\u2019s economic growth since then shows an upward trend.\n\nThe 2018 GDP growth of 6.3% is the highest in eight years, indeed in 10 years (In 2007 the economy grew by 7.1%.) Rotich\u2019s claim is therefore accurate.\n\nhas annual data on economic growth in 194 countries. Its latest\n\nThe world\u2019s economy grew an estimated 3.6% that year. (\n\nOnly 21 countries achieved a growth rate of at least 6.3%.\n\nAfrica Check it would be better to compare Kenya\u2019s growth to growth in countries with similar economic conditions, especially its regional peers. This is because more mature economies generally grow at a slower pace. There\u2019s more actual growth in the US economy than in Kenya\u2019s, for example, even though that country has a much lower GDP growth\n\nKenya had the third fastest growing economy among the five members of the\n\nthe 2018 economic survey. It was behind Tanzania (6.6%) and Rwanda (8.6%), but ahead of Uganda (6.2%) and Burundi (0.1%).\n\nof wages paid in the public and private sectors. These \u201crelate to basic salary and other allowances which are paid regularly to employees\u201d.\n\nPublic servants\u2019 wages have risen by an average KSh46 billion a year in six years - from\n\nshows a similar pattern over 14 years, with the wage bill rising from KSh165.9 billion in 2003/04 to KSh698.5 billion in 2017/18.\n\nRising wages, Rotich said, left \u201cfewer and fewer resources for development\u201d.\n\ndefines excise as \u201ca tax levied on goods manufactured in Kenya or imported into the country\u201d. The\n\nexcise duties are indirect taxes on the sale or use of specific products\u201d.\n\nThey\u2019re \u201cindirect\u201d because they\u2019re paid by producers or traders, who then pass the excise cost on to consumers, in the final price.\n\n, excise duty in Kenya has traditionally been used as a stop-gap in the budget when all else has failed.\n\nBut the reality is now different. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve put up the rate on a number of products, it has affected consumption,\u201d Hira told Africa Check. This has led to lower collections.\n\nHira gave the example of Senator Keg, a beer aimed at the lower income market to prevent the consumption of illicit alcohol. After excise tax was added to it, sales tanked.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, excise has been a sin tax. Now it\u2019s extended to so many products that it\u2019s not working.\u201d\n\ntax consultants, told Africa Check the drop in excise as a share of GDP might be due to higher economic growth.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, it is odd that excise may drop as a percentage of GDP when it is applied to goods and services that are not usually excisable, such as airtime, water, fruit juice, cash transfers and banking.\u201d\n\nDevelopment economist Anzetse Were said the national treasury faces a structural problem. \u201cFrom a macroeconomic perspective, the cabinet secretary is trying to get excise duty to generate the revenue it used to,\u201d she told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cWhat he didn\u2019t say is that tax revenue has been declining as a percentage of GDP for a while now.\u201d\n\nRotich said data on contracts made by public entities were published monthly on a dedicated portal.\n\nshows that as at 13 June 2019, a total of 5,311\n\nwith a value of KSh147.57 billion had been awarded by 386 government entities. -\n\nRotich said the ranking was in the 2018\n\nUnctad works to \u201csupport developing countries to access the benefits of a globalised economy more fairly and effectively\u201d.\n\nhow prepared an economy is to support online shopping.\n\nIt is calculated from four indicators, all with the same weight: account ownership at a financial institutions or mobile money service provider, the share of individuals using the internet, reliability of postal services and the number of secure internet servers per 1,000 people.\n\nBut the country isn\u2019t ranked 85th globally.
