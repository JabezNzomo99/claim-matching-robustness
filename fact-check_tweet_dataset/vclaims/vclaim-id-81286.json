I have an econ degree which means I know just enough not to understand any of what our government is [inaudible]\u201d Paul: \u201cMine\u2019s in biology and English so this is going to be a great conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just me. I have a biology degree, okay? But with Bitcoin my concern always was whether or not something has real value. So I could imagine a kind of coin that was exchangeable. This gets back to the whole idea, does money have to be exchangeable for something to be of value?\u201d\n\nPaul attended Baylor University between 1981 and 1984 but never graduated. Yet he was able to attend Duke University Medical School and received a degree there in 1988. At the time, Duke\u2019s medical school did not require students to have a bachelor\u2019s degree, though the policy has since changed, according to a 2010 report in the Lexington Herald-Leader. (Ron Paul, his father and the former member of Congress, does have a biology degree.)\n\n\u201cIn the jocular bantering with the host, Dr. Rand Paul mentioned \u2018degree,\u2019 but anyone who has read Dr. Paul\u2019s official biography on his Web site can see that he was accepted early into one of the most prestigious medical schools in the country \u2014 Duke University School of Medicine,\u201d said Brian Darling, Paul\u2019s senior communications director. \u201cDr. Paul finished the requirements for medical school in two and one half years. While in college, Dr. Paul did study biology and English. He has no college degree and has a medical degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unfair to give Senator Paul 3 Pinocchios because a M.D. Degree is the study of biomedical sciences according to the Duke University School of Medicine . In other words, a M.D. is a biology degree. Merriam-Webster defines biology as \u2018a branch of knowledge that deals with living organisms and vital processes.\u2019 Dr. Paul never said he had an undergraduate degree in biology, and it is accurate for him to say that he has a biology degree. You are making inferences from his statement that are unwarranted. It is common knowledge that the study of medicine is the study of human biology, and a MD has a doctorate degree in one area of study of the science of biology.\u201d\n\nThis is the second time in recent weeks we have had to fact check something that Paul\u2019s staff suggested was an off-the-cuff remark not to be taken seriously. We\u2019d be more inclined to brush this off if Paul had not made this assertion twice in one day \u2014 or if his staff in the past had not blamed the media for misreporting on his college credentials.\n\nPaul studied biology (and English) at Baylor, but he didn\u2019t earn a degree. There\u2019s no excuse for resume-inflation, even when it\u2019s jocular. We can\u2019t quite say this is worthy of Four Pinocchios, but the senator should be more careful in the future.", "lang": "en"}
