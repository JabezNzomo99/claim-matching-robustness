This is what is being claimed with a viral photo of a Hindi newspaper advertising the Delhi government\u2019s assistance scheme for riot victims.\n\nThe viral image shows the word Muslim\u2019 in the top right corner beside the header Danga peedito ki madad hetu (For the aid of riot victims). It gives the impression that the government is providing monetary help only to Muslim victims. The claim along with the photo also says that the Delhi government is biased in providing compensation to riot victims.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral image to be morphed. The original photo of the advertisement does not include the name of any religion.\n\nAmong others, Facebook page NAMO India posted the morphed image on Facebook. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nA simple reverse search helped us find the original photo of the newspaper. The actual advertisement does not mention any religion.\n\nWe found that the viral photo is taken from the February 29 edition of Dainik Jagran newspaper. The advertisement in this edition too does not have the name of any religion. The official Facebook page of AAP also posted the advertisement on February 29, 2020.\n\nDelhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had on February 27, 2020, announced this assistance scheme, which includes Rs 10 lakh to the kin of deceased and Rs 5 lakh to the families of minors who died in the Delhi violence. A detailed advertisement in this regard was put out by the government on various newspapers on February 29.", "lang": "en"}
