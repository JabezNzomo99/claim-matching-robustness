This damaging claim stems from an alt-right hoax intended to slur members of the LGBT community.\n\nExamples of these posts can be found here , here , here , here and here .\n\nAccording to one of the posts, the premise of the term \u201cclovergender\u201d is that \u201ca person is a younger age at heart and therefore it\u2019s okay for them to be with someone much younger, even if they\u2019re an adult and the person they want to be with is a minor.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Advocate, a magazine that focuses on gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer news and politics, former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli began \u201cpromoting \u2018clovergender,\u2019 an identity concocted by trolls to mock LGBT people\u201d on January 4, 2017 ( here ). As reported by Snopes two days later, Shkreli tweeted \u201cPlease spread clovergender awareness,\u201d linking to a Twitter account that no longer exists ( here ).\n\nIn August 2017, Shkreli, also known as \u201cPharma Bro,\u201d was sentenced to seven years in prison for defrauding investors in his hedge funds ( here , here ).\n\nThe 2017 Snopes article shows screenshots of posts on 4chan, the image-based Internet bulletin board where \u201cmany of the recruitment techniques of the so-called alt-right were piloted,\u201d according to Wired ( here ). On December 31, 2016, a 4chan submission read: \u201cWe\u2019re creating a new gender to troll SJWs (Social Justice Warriors) with. Clovergender: a child trapped in a man\u2019s body who is attracted to other children. Pronouns: Cl/Clir/Climself We will be trolling on tumblr and facebook.\u201d A thread of subsequent 4chan submissions, archived by Snopes, can be found archive.is/6VSzZ .\n\nSince the Clovergender hoax resurfaced on Facebook in July 2020, many users have taken the claim seriously, leaving comments like: \u201cFirst off if you are grown enough to have a relationship on top of that something sexual you ARE NOT A CHILD IN AN ADULT BODY Kids don\u2019t think sexual\u201d and \u201cPedophiles are the most disgusting animals on the planet. There is absolutely nothing normal or right about it.\u201d Some of the posts use comments or hashtags to falsely suggest that \u201cClovergender\u201d is endorsed by the LGBT community.\n\nFalse, damaging and ignorant claims linking pedophilia to the LGBT community are not new, as documented here by The Atlantic and here by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a nonprofit civil rights organization that monitors hate and extremism.\n\nFalse. \u201cClovergender\u201d is a hoax that originated on 4chan and has since been spread to slur LGBT people.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
