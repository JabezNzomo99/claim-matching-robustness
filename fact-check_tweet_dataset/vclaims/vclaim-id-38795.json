This is misleading; the graphic about facial hair and respirator use is more than two years old and is unrelated to the recent deadly outbreak.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to novel coronavirus safety, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has some suggestions about facial hair,\u201d CNN said in an article.\n\n\u201cSide whiskers, soul patches, lampshades and handlebar moustaches are good to go, according to a CDC infographic,\u201d said the article, which has since been corrected.\n\nOther media have carried the same claim here, here and here, linking the graphic -- which shows different facial hair styles and how well they work with a respirator -- to the novel coronavirus.\n\nBut the graphic is from a November 2017 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) blog post -- more than two years before the discovery of the novel coronavirus, which has spread from China around the world, leaving thousands dead.\n\nThe \u201cCDC does not currently recommend the general public use facemasks or respirators for #COVID19,\u201d it said on Twitter, referring to the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThis 2017 @NIOSH graphic is intended for workers who wear tight-fitting respirators,\u201d it added, retweeting a similar explanation from NIOSH, which is part of the CDC.\n\nThe blog post now includes a warning at the top: \u201cThis blog and infographic from 2017 are intended for workers who wear respirators at work.\u201d\n\nThe post was intended for people who want to grow facial hair for campaigns such as No-Shave November or Movember, but have to wear tight-fitting respirators.\n\n\u201cResearch tells us that the presence of facial hair under the sealing surface causes 20 to 1000 times more leakage compared to clean-shaven individuals,\u201d it said, recommending styles that do not interfere with these respirators.\n\nWhile the CDC does not recommend face masks for people who are well, there are specific scenarios related to the novel coronavirus in which it does encourage their use.\n\n\u201cFacemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility),\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s website.", "lang": "en"}
