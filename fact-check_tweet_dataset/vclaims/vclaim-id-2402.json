They then began recovering as public sector wage growth slowed. In recent years the gap between the two has narrowed again.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010 the private sector saw a real terms cut in wages, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The IFS describes wages as \u201clargely frozen\u201d during this time as it was only increasing by around 1% in cash terms\u2014inflation at the same time peaked at around 5%.\n\nIn contrast, public sector wages continued to grow at about the same rate as they had before the financial crisis and were much closer to the level of inflation. The IFS puts this in part down to the fact that many public sector wages are agreed in three year settlements. Many of these settlements lasted from 2008 to 2011, though that wasn\u2019t the case for all public sector workers.\n\nLooking just at averages isn\u2019t always helpful. It doesn\u2019t tell us much about the experience of individual people and the differences between their jobs in the public and private sector.\n\nThe IFS have looked at the changing gap between public and private sector wages, adjusting for the different types of workers in each sector. It found that after the recession public sector pay increased, compared to the private sector which fell sharply. But the IFS says that \u201cthe public sector pay restraint imposed since 2011 has returned the difference between public and private pay to around its pre-crisis level\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
