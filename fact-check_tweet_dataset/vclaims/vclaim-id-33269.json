League of Women Voters, Los Angeles Times, Sacramento Bee all say Prop 10 will empower your local community to limit rent increases. No effect on homeowners. Help for struggling renters. Vote yes on 10.\"\n\nThe measure\u2019s opponents seized on the claim that Prop 10 would have \"no effect on homeowners.\" They argue that statement is false and \"recklessly disregards the truth.\" They\u2019ve asked media outlets to pull the ad.\n\nGiven the disagreement over the claim and significance of the ballot measure, we decided to check the facts.\n\nThis, however, is not the only claim that\u2019s in dispute. There\u2019s also disagreement over whether rent control really helps \"struggling renters,\" as the ad states. Economists argue it helps the select few who have their rents capped, but has the unintended consequence of making rental housing scarcer and increasing the average rent citywide, a topic Capital Public Radio explored earlier this year.\n\nProp 10 would repeal the state's Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which blocks rent control on units built after February 1995. The law also prevents cities from imposing rent caps on condominiums and single-family homes.\n\nRepealing the law would allow cities to craft their own, potentially stronger, rent control rules, including on condos and single-family homes.\n\nA report released this month by UC Berkeley\u2019s Fisher Center for Real Estate & Urban Economics found the measure would negatively affect owners who rent out single-family homes.\n\nRent control on single-family homes \"would decrease property values for homeowners by 10 percent to 15 percent over time,\" for the more than 2 million California owners who rent out single-family homes, according to the study.\n\nA spokesman for the No on 10 campaign added that, based on the campaign\u2019s interpretation of existing laws, rent control would automatically be imposed on single-family home rentals in several cities should Prop 10 pass. Supporters of the measure rejected that interpretation.\n\nResponse from Yes on 10\n\nAsked about the claim in the ad, the Yes on 10 campaign emphasized that the initiative doesn\u2019t force cities to impose any rent control rules. It simply gives them that option.\n\n\"The measure itself does not make any changes to local rent control laws,\" wrote Beverly Grossman Palmer, an attorney for the Yes on 10 campaign, in a letter to broadcasters. \"This is a campaign, not a legal brief. The California voters who view this ad understand the message: People who own their own homes are not going to be affected by rent control measures.\"\n\nPeter Dreier, a professor of politics at Occidental College who has testified to lawmakers in favor of Prop 10, said there\u2019s another reason to believe the measure won\u2019t affect homeowners: It \"would be politically stupid\" for cities to impose rent control on single family homes.\n\n\"There\u2019s never been a rent control law in the country to that effect,\" he said. \"That\u2019s not going to happen.\"\n\nApartment associations and real estate groups have contributed more than $30 million to defeat Prop 10. Supporters, meanwhile, have raised more than $12 million dollars for it, primarily from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The foundation is a nonprofit group based in Los Angeles, and is active in supporting political campaigns.\n\nIn a recent TV ad, the Yes on 10 campaign claimed California\u2019s rent control measure would have \"no effect on homeowners.\"\n\nProp 10 would not force cities to impose rent control, but it would give them that option -- including on single family home rentals.\n\nProp 10 supporters say it would be a politically poor decision for cities to do that. But that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen.\n\nThe TV ad is partially accurate. But it leaves out the key information that single-family homes are currently exempt from rent control in the state, and that Prop 10 would at least give cities the option to impose rent regulations on them.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
