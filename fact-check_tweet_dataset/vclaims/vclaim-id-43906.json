Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim.\n\nAndhra Pradesh CM Jagan Mohan Reddy has proposed three capitals to the state on December 17, 2019. Since then, farmers who had earlier donated their lands for \u2018Amaravati\u2019 have been protesting against it. \n\n\n\nThe same photo can be found in a tweet made in November 2018. The same photo can also be found in a YouTube video uploaded in May 2018.
