Raubenheimer\u2019s signature is visible at the bottom of the pictures, though it is not very clear.\n\nAFP contacted the South Africa-based photographer on Facebook and he confirmed that he took the pictures.\n\n\u201cThese photos were taken by me in the Kruger National Park last week near Satara... The Giraffe was eating normal had some Buffalo birds on it and seemed happy,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesman for the KWS confirmed that the pictured giraffe was in South Africa, not in Kenya.\n\n\u201cKenya Wildlife Service wishes to state that the photograph of a sickly giraffe doing rounds on social media does not originate from Kenya, as many have been led to believe. The person who forwarded the post omitted to indicate its rightful origin/location, which led to other social media users to think is in Kenya,\u201d read a statement from the KWS sent to AFP by email.\n\n\u201cFrom the appearance of the giraffe as seen in the picture our vets say that it indicative the giraffes could be infected by the papilloma virus,\u201d added KWS spokesman Ngugi Gecaga.\n\nIn South Africa, a spokesman for Kruger National Park told AFP that several giraffes had been spotted with the papilloma virus but that they were not being treated as the park let \u201cnature take its course\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere have been several sightings of such animals in the KNP. It is papilloma virus,\u201d Isaac Phaahla told AFP in an email.", "lang": "en"}
