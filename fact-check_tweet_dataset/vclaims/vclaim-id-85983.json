Mary Landrieu (D-La.) cast the deciding vote for Obamacare.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T15:44:16Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85983", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/22/did-mary-landrieu-cast-the-deciding-vote-for-obamacare/", "vclaim": "In this case, the Fact Checker was curious about the claim that Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who likely will have a tight race, cast the \u201cdeciding vote\u201d for the law. AFP is clearly trying to undercut the publicity surrounding her effort to pass a fix to the law that would allow individual policyholders to keep their plans.\n\nAs always with bills in the Senate, there are critical procedure votes. Because of GOP objection, Democrats needed to win a supermajority of 60 votes in order to end debate and advance the Senate\u2019s version of the legislation. (This is known as a cloture vote.) On Christmas Eve in 2009, the bill was passed in the Senate by a vote of 60 to 39.\n\nEvery Democrat in the Senate, including Landrieu, voted for that bill. But it was never officially reconciled with a House version because the Democrats lost the Massachusetts Senate seat in a special election. So an amendment of the Senate bill, crafted in the House, was finally passed on March 25 under a procedure that avoided the 60-vote requirement. That bill only needed 50 votes, and it passed 56 to 43, with Landrieu again voting with the majority.\n\nLevi Russell, an AFP spokesman, said the first vote backs up the ad\u2019s statement. \u201cIn order to achieve cloture and pass President Obama\u2019s health care law out of the Senate, the bill needed 60 votes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bill passed 60-39 out of the Senate. As Landrieu voted yes, her vote provided the critical margin for passage. If she had voted no, the bill would not have passed.\u201d\n\nOkay, but is that what really happened? The deciding vote is really that last vote reached\u2014and that wasn\u2019t Landrieu. Instead it was then Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska (who, by the way, voted against the second bill.)\n\nThe headline on The Washington Post article on Dec. 20, 2009 was \u201cDeal on health bill is reached.\u201d The article said: \u201cMajority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) secured the pivotal 60th vote after acceding to the demands of Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) for tighter restrictions on insurance coverage for abortions, along with increased federal aid for his home state and breaks for favored health-care interests.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Republicans immediately blasted Nelson for giving up his vote in exchange for the so-called \u201cCornhusker kickback\u201d \u2014 full payment of expanded Medicaid coverage in the state. (The provision was dropped in the House revision that crafted the final version of the law.)\n\nIt is fair to say that Landrieu was one of the last holdouts. But she had announced her support four days before Nelson did.\n\nRussell says this is a distinction without a difference. \u201cThe political reality is that each of the 60 Senators cast a \u2018deciding vote,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cLandrieu\u2019s vote held the power to either stop or save Obamacare.\u201d\n\nGiven that Landrieu was one of the last holdouts on the law, a reasonable case could be made that her vote was important for the outcome, at least for the first vote. But calling her the \u201cdeciding vote\u201d is going too far, as it invites a slippery slope in which attack ads could be made against every Senate Democrat, saying each cast the deciding vote.", "lang": "en"}
