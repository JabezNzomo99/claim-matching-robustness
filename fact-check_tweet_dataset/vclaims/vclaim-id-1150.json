The post confuses COVID-19 testing (viral tests) and COVID-19 antibody testing, which are two different tests.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nOne post reads: \u201c(Sharing) let this sink in... the COMMON COLD can produce a positive COVID test!! do the increase of numbers really mean ANYTHING at this point?? so we are shutting down businesses, mandating masks & causing mass hysteria of this \u2018second wave\u2019 for THIS?!! 99.99997% survival rate!!\u201d\n\nThis post then links to CDC\u2019s antibody testing page where the screenshots have been taken from ( here ). However, the Facebook user confuses COVID-19 viral tests with antibody tests.\n\nThe CDC explains on its website: \u201cTwo kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: viral tests and antibody tests. A viral test tells you if you have a current infection. An antibody test might tell you if you had a past infection.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe CDC says there is a chance that antibody testing may produce a positive result if you have antibodies from another virus from the coronavirus family, such as the common cold ( here ). Some milder coronaviruses can cause illnesses like the common cold, while others cause more severe illnesses like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) ( here , here ). The COVID-19 viral test tells patients whether they have a current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 ( here ).\n\nUsers are equating the information on COVID-19 antibody testing to viral COVID-19 testing, which is false.\n\nFalse. The posts confuse COVID-19 viral testing with COVID-19 antibody testing. The antibody test might give a positive result if antibodies from another virus from the coronavirus family are tested, milder strains of which can cause a common cold.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
