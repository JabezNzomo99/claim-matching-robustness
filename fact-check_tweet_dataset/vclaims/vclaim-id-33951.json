Elizabeth Warren criticized South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg for holding a glitzy \u201cclosed-door\u201d fundraiser at a California wine cave. A pool reporter was permitted to cover Buttigieg\u2019s remarks at the event, so the event wasn\u2019t entirely off-limits to the media.\n\u2022 Warren also boasted about not doing private fundraisers: \u201cI do not sell access to my time.\u201d That may be the case now, but she transferred $10 million from her Senate campaign to her presidential race.\n\u2022 Buttigieg said he won with 80% in \u201cMike Pence\u2019s Indiana,\u201d but Klobuchar was correct when she said he lost by 20 points (actually almost 25) in his only statewide bid for Hoosier office.\n\u2022 None Warren again undersold the impact of her \u201cUltra Millionaire Tax\u201d plan, saying, \u201cI have a two-cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires,\u201d when her plan calls for triple that rate, a 6% annual tax, on all wealth over $1 billion.\n\u2022 Former Vice President Joe Biden was right when he said international public opinion polls rate President Donald Trump below China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping. But most foreigners still want the U.S. to be the world\u2019s leading power.\n\u2022 Buttigieg claimed Trump has not made \u201ca peep\u201d in support of \u201cfolks out there standing up for democracy\u201d in Hong Kong, but Trump last month signed two bills in support of Hong Kong protesters, over the objections of the Chinese government.\n\u2022 None Klobuchar said on trade: \u201c95% of our customers are outside of our borders.\u201d Americans make up only about 5% of the world\u2019s population. But the rest of the world customers, since many are relatively poor and unable to buy a lot of American goods.\n\u2022 Biden said \u201cmost Americans, if they received a bill for $400 or more they\u2019d have to sell something or borrow the money.\u201d But \u201cmost\u201d actually said they\u2019d cover the expense with cash or credit.\n\nSeven Democratic candidates debated on Dec. 19: Biden, Warren, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Sen. Bernie Sanders and businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer. The debate was hosted by \u201cPBS Newshour\u201d and Politico and held in Los Angeles.\n\nWarren and Buttigieg got into a heated back-and-forth over how they raise money for their presidential campaigns \u2014 a dispute that started when she criticized Buttigieg for a glitzy fundraiser he held on Dec. 15 at Hall Wines in Napa Valley in California.\n\n\u201cThe mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900 a bottle wine. \u2026 He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open door, but this one was closed door,\u201d Warren said.\n\nButtigieg did hold the fundraiser in wine caves that \u201cboast a chandelier with 1,500 Swarovski crystals, an onyx banquet table to reflect its luminescence and bottles of cabernet sauvignon that sell for as much as $900,\u201d as reported by the Associated Press on Dec. 13, a few days before the event.\n\nThe mayor also said on Dec. 9 that he would allow the press to cover private fundraisers. And a pool reporter was permitted to cover Buttigieg\u2019s remarks at the event, as evidenced by the pool report, posted on Twitter by a CNN video producer.\n\nBut Warren\u2019s campaign pointed us to a Huff Post report that noted \u201cmost\u201d of the event \u201cwas closed off\u201d to the press. \u201cThough reporters covering Buttigieg\u2019s campaign could view his prepared remarks and a Q&A session, the rest of the event was closed off to everyone but the invited donors,\u201d the report said.\n\nSo the event was partly open door and partly closed. Another member of the press \u2014 a writer for Vox\u2019s Recode \u2014 found photos of the dinner in the wine cave on Instagram and tweeted them.\n\nIn criticizing Buttigieg, the Massachusetts senator boasted that in her presidential campaign, \u201cI do not sell access to my time.\u201d Buttigieg shot back, \u201cAs of when, senator?\u201d\n\nIt was in February that Warren sent an email to supporters that said she would not hold private fundraisers or one-on-one meetings with big donors. \u201cThat means no fancy receptions or big money fund-raisers only with people who can write the big checks,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBut, as Buttigieg pointed out, Warren\u2019s presidential campaign has benefited from money that she raised at fundraisers she held as a Senate candidate.\n\nWarren has raised $60 million for her presidential campaign so far, according to her campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. But that includes $10.4 million she transferred from her Senate campaign, Elizabeth for MA, to her presidential campaign in three large donations from January to March of this year.\n\nPrior to that, her Senate campaign received nearly $4 million from the Elizabeth Warren Action Fund, a joint fundraising committee that can raise larger amounts than a candidate committee. That money flowed from March 2017 to December 2018, according to FEC records.\n\nSo, despite swearing off big checks now, Warren\u2019s presidential campaign did benefit from her pre-pledge fundraising. \u201cThe open secret of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign is that her big-money fund-raising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the presidency,\u201d the New York Times wrote in September.\n\nKlobuchar got the better of Buttigieg on his claim that he is electable in Republican-leaning Indiana.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Buttigieg won reelection as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, in 2015 by a vote of 8,515 to 2,074 against his Republican opponent, Kelly S. Jones, getting 80.4% of the vote.\n\nBut South Bend is just one city, not the whole state. Klobuchar alluded to the thumping Buttigieg received in his earlier statewide bid for office in 2010, when he ran at age 28 to be Indiana\u2019s state treasurer. Buttigieg received 633,243 votes, while his Republican opponent, Richard E. Mourdock, won with well over 1 million. In percentage terms, Buttigieg lost by 24.9 percentage points, so Klobuchar was actually being charitable when she put the margin at 20 points.\n\nAs she has on the campaign trail and in the November debate, Warren said she has a \u201ctwo-cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires,\u201d but she neglected to mention that the annual tax rate on wealth over $1 billion would be triple that.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with a wealth tax, the idea of a two-cent tax on the great fortunes in this country \u2014 $50 million and above,\u201d Warren said.\n\nLater in the debate, she said, \u201cI have a two-cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires, and that gives us enough money to invest in all our babies aged 0 to 5, to put in a historic $800 billion investment in public schools K through 12, and that will permit us to offer technical school, two-year college, four-year college for every single person who wants an education, cancel student loan debt for 50 \u2014 put a $50 billion investment in our historically black colleges and universities and cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans.\u201d\n\nUnder Warren\u2019s original wealth tax plan, households would pay an annual 2% tax on all assets \u2014 net worth \u2014 above $50 million and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.\n\nAs we wrote in our story \u201cFacts on Warren\u2019s Wealth Tax Plan,\u201d University of California, Berkeley economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez estimated Warren\u2019s tax would fall on about 75,000 U.S. households (less than 0.1%) and would raise around $2.75 trillion over 10 years.\n\nBut since then, Warren unveiled her plan to pay for Medicare for All, which included upping the wealth tax on assets over $1 billion to 6%. In other words, though Warren talks about a 2% wealth tax for \u201cmillionaires and billionaires,\u201d the rate would actually be 6% on wealth over $1 billion, every year.\n\nWhile Forbes estimates there are less than 1,000 billionaires in the U.S., Warren estimated the additional 3% annual wealth tax would raise an additional $1 trillion over 10 years.\n\nAs we have written, it is a matter of debate among economists and tax experts as to whether her plan would raise as much revenue as she expects. Indeed, the Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) last week released a detailed analysis of Warren\u2019s proposed wealth tax and projected that, if implemented in 2021, it would raise between $2.3 trillion and $2.7 trillion over 10 years \u2013 roughly $1 trillion to $1.4 trillion less than the Warren campaign\u2019s estimate. PWBM also estimated that the wealth tax would reduce gross domestic product in 2050 by about 1-2%, depending on how the money is spent.\n\nBiden was right when he said China\u2019s leader is rated above Trump in international opinion polls.\n\nPolling conducted for the Pew Research Center in 2018 asked people in 25 different countries if they had confidence in Trump and four other world leaders \u201cto do the right thing regarding world affairs.\u201d The median response: Only 27% had confidence in Trump, who came in at the bottom, while 34% had confidence in Xi Jinping.\n\nAs for the other leaders, 52% had confidence in Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, and 46% had confidence in France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron. Even Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin edged out Trump, with a 30% confidence rating.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that despite the international public\u2019s low opinion of Trump, most would still prefer the United States to lead the world. Pew asked whether people preferred a future in which \u201cthe U.S. is the world\u2019s leading power or China is the world\u2019s leading power.\u201d The median response: 63% preferred the U.S., while only 19% said China.\n\nButtigieg: Not a \u2018Peep\u2019 from Trump on Hong Kong\n\nButtigieg claimed Trump has not made \u201ca peep\u201d in support of \u201cfolks out there standing up for democracy\u201d in Hong Kong. But while some have been critical of the president for not being outspoken enough in support of Hong Kong protesters, Trump last month signed two bills in support of them, and over the objections of the Chinese government.\n\nOn Oct. 4, CNN reported that during a private phone call in June, Trump \u201cpromised Chinese President Xi Jinping that the US would remain quiet on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong while trade talks continued.\u201d\n\nTranscripts of the phone call have not been made public, so we can\u2019t verify what Trump may have promised. But Buttigieg goes too far with his claim that Trump hasn\u2019t made a \u201cpeep.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Nov. 22, Trump said the protesters would have been \u201cobliterated\u201d by Chinese forces if he hadn\u2019t asked Xi to not send them in.\n\nLater, Trump was asked if he would veto two bills from the Senate that support the Hong Kong students.\n\n\u201cLook, we have to stand with Hong Kong,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also standing with President Xi. He\u2019s a friend of mine. He\u2019s an incredible guy. We have to stand. But I\u2019d like to see them work it out. Okay. We have to see and work it out. But I stand with Hong Kong. I stand with freedom.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Trump signed the two bills on Nov. 27. The first was S. 1838, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, which requires the U.S. to every year \u201cassess whether political developments in Hong Kong justify changing Hong Kong\u2019s unique treatment under U.S. law,\u201d including not being subject to tariffs levied upon China. It also includes several human rights provisions. The second bill, S. 2710, prohibits the sale of \u201cspecified munitions\u201d including tear gas, rubber bullets and handcuffs to the Hong Kong Police Force.\n\nAlthough China strenuously objected to the bills, Trump tried to walk a diplomatic line and appease both sides, saying, \u201cI signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China, and the people of Hong Kong. They are being enacted in the hope that Leaders and Representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long term peace and prosperity for all.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNBC, the Hong Kong government \u201cexpressed strong opposition\u201d to the bills and called them \u201can obvious intervention of Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, they are unnecessary and without grounds, they will also harm the relationship and interests between Hong Kong and the U.S.\u201d\n\nIn explaining why she supports a reworked version of Trump\u2019s trade deal with Mexico and Canada, Klobuchar stated that \u201c95% of our customers are outside of our borders.\u201d The statistic accurately reflects basic demography, but it could be misleading about the full potential of international trade.\n\nAs PolitiFact explained when Biden made a similar claim back in July 2016, 95% of the world\u2019s customers are indeed outside of the United States because Americans account for a bit less than 5% of the global population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population is 330 million, or about 4.3% of the 7.6 billion total.\n\nBut vast swaths of the global population are in poverty and unlikely to be big buyers of American products. In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says on its website that nearly half of all American exports are sold to 20 countries that make up around 6% of the world\u2019s population outside the U.S. So, while the statistic is used, and even referenced elsewhere by the Chamber of Commerce, it\u2019s not necessarily reflective of the actual percentage of people outside the U.S. who buy American products.\n\n\u201cYou have most Americans, if they received a bill for $400 or more they\u2019d have to sell something or borrow the money,\u201d Biden said.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that many Americans report being in that situation, the term \u201cmost\u201d isn\u2019t accurate.\n\nThe statistic comes from an annual Federal Reserve study on the economic well-being of U.S. households. The Fed\u2019s May 2019 report found that \u201c[i]f faced with an unexpected expense of $400 \u2026 27 percent [of adults] would borrow or sell something to pay for the expense, and 12 percent would not be able to cover the expense at all.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s nearly 40% of Americans \u2014 but not \u201cmost.\u201d The report instead found that 61% of adults said \u201cthey would cover it with cash, savings, or a credit card paid off at the next statement\u201d \u2014 up from 48% in the first survey, released in 2014.\n\nJudd, DJ (@DJJudd). \u201cWarren just hit Pete Buttigieg on his Napa fundraiser in a wine cave, saying, \u2018He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open door, but this one was closed door.\u2019 The mayor\u2019s remarks were open to pool, which KSRO\u2019s @mike_dewald filed on behalf of the pool.\u201d Twitter. 19 Dec 2019.\n\nSchleifer, Teddy. \u201cHere are some photos of the Buttigieg fundraiser in Napa \u2014 with the famous wine cave and the chandelier with 1,500 Swarovski crystals \u2014 that @BrianSlodysko wrote about.\u201d Twitter. 16 Dec 2019.\n\nSchleifer, Teddy. \u201cActually, folks, it is based on @BrianSlodysko and @AP_Politics reporting.
