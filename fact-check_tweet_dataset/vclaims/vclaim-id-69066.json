Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.\n\nThe ad, released in early August, charged that \"West Virginia Joe\" had transformed himself into \"Washington Joe.\" And a key exhibit for this argument was a pricey boat he owned.\n\nManchin owns a \"$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht,\" the ad said, illustrating the claim with a photograph showing a docked vessel.\n\nIs this accurate? We took a closer look.\n\nManchin\u2019s campaign does not dispute that he owns a boat, \"Almost Heaven,\" saying it is where Manchin has typically lived when in Washington and not back home in West Virginia.\n\nIn fact, the boat is hardly a secret. It has been written about periodically before; articles often mention sessions he\u2019s held on the boat with other lawmakers to negotiate legislation and strategy.\n\nIn 2014, for instance, Time magazine wrote that both \"Almost Heaven\" and Manchin\u2019s previous vessel, the \"Black Tie,\" serve as \"a kind of floating incubator of that tenderest of Washington flowers in the first decades of the 21st century: bipartisanship.\"\n\nTo back up its assertion, the NRSC provided PolitiFact with a document labeled \"general index or abstract of title continuation sheet No. 1,\" the cost of the vessel was listed $700,000.\n\nManchin\u2019s campaign instead offered a different document with a lower dollar figure.\n\nThat document, a memorandum of sale from 2014, said the purchase price for the vessel was $220,000. The document says that Manchin purchased the boat from M&T Bank, with National Liquidators as the broker of the sale.\n\nIndependent experts we contacted were unable to explain the difference in the two dollar figures, beyond speculating that the vessel was purchased from a seller eager to get rid of it and later insured at the boat\u2019s market value.\n\nAccording to Boats.com, any vessel \"over 40 feet long almost always qualifies\" as a yacht. By the length standard alone, that would qualify \"Almost Heaven\" as a yacht: The vessel, built in 2001, is 65 feet long, according to Coast Guard documents provided to PolitiFact by the NRSC.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a \"luxury\" vessel, however, is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nAccording to the Westlawn Institute of Marine Technology, the word \"yacht ... connotes elegance and expense.\" Boats.com adds, \"Just as a cocky walk would never be mistaken for a limping shuffle, yacht attitude is the net result of a combination of factors that are easy to spot as a group but hard to quantify individually.\"\n\nThe vessel is listed as \"recreational\" on documents. However, a less confrontational -- but similarly accurate -- description could be \"houseboat,\" since it is Manchin\u2019s residence in Washington.\n\nThe NRSC said that Manchin has a \"$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no dispute that Manchin has a boat docked in Washington, D.C. Its 40-foot length would generally qualify it as a yacht, but since Manchin lives there when he is in town, it could be just as easily described as a houseboat. The vessel was purchased for much less, but it appears to be insured for $700,000. Whether it qualifies as a \"luxury\" vessel is a matter of opinion.\n\nThe information we\u2019ve found backs up elements of both the NRSC\u2019s original assertion and Manchin\u2019s counterargument, so we rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
