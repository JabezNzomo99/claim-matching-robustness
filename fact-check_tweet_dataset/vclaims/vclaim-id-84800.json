When his comment drew criticism, specifically from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, his campaign pointed to the New York Police Department\u2019s practice after 9/11 of spying on Muslim communities for potential terrorist activities. Then the campaign criticized New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for shuttering the surveillance program, saying he \u201csuccumbed to unfounded criticisms\u201d and \u201celiminated the efforts\u201d of NYPD to work with Muslim communities.\n\nWhen the practice was revealed, the NYPD received both praise and criticism. Supporters said the tactics were lawful and kept the city safe. Then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended NYPD and the program, and NYPD claimed that the department has helped prevent 14 terrorist plots against New York since 9/11. But ProPublica reported the figure \u201coverstates both the number of serious, developed terrorist plots against New York and exaggerates the NYPD\u2019s role in stopping attacks.\u201d In response to ProPublica\u2019s findings, Bloomberg said \u201cwe\u2019ll never know\u201d how many plots the department truly thwarted.\n\n\u201cRelated to demographics, I can tell you that information that have come in has not commenced an investigation,\u201d Galati testified. But he said the information provided by the unit \u201cdoes have value\u201d and its reports contain \u201ca lot of bits and pieces of value, of intelligence value.\u201d\n\nThe practice angered Muslims in New York, who sued the city. Earlier this year, NYPD settled the two federal lawsuits claiming Muslims were the target of baseless surveillance and investigations because of their religion. The department did not admit wrongdoing. It agreed to pay about $2 million in attorneys fees, and to oversight measures to make sure it is following guidelines to prevent religious profiling.\n\nThe unit was largely inactive and its detectives reassigned by early 2014, when NYPD Commissioner William J. Bratton took over and disbanded it. Announcing the closing of the unit in April 2014, de Blasio said the decision was \u201ca critical step forward in easing tensions between the police and the communities they serve, so that our cops and our citizens can help one another go after the real bad guys.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker takes no stance on the merits of NYPD\u2019s surveillance tactics or Cruz\u2019s proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods. But his campaign goes much too far saying de Blasio \u201csuccumbed to unfounded criticisms and eliminated the efforts of law enforcement to work with Muslim communities to stop radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nThere are two elements to this claim. First is that de Blasio ended the program because he \u201csuccumbed to unfounded criticisms.\u201d There was criticism, and whether it was \u201cunfounded\u201d may be a matter of opinion. But by the time that de Blasio and Bratton shuttered it, it was largely inactive. And over its six years, none of the information collected by the Demographics Unit led to a single case. The Cruz campaign\u2019s characterization makes it seem as though de Blasio disbanded an active program because of the criticism, but that is an inaccurate description.\n\nThe second part is that de Blasio\u2019s decision \u201celiminated the efforts of law enforcement to work with\u201d Muslim communities. But this program actually fractured the police department\u2019s relationship with many in the American Muslim community in New York, and a group of Muslims sued the department over it. On both fronts, this characterization is false, and earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
