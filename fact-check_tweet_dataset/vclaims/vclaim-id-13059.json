We explored this in a fact-check on Democrats\u2019 rhetoric about the health-care bill and findings in a Congressional Budget Office report.\n\nSeveral others used this talking point during Sunday talk show interviews on March 19, including some hosts, a commentator and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine): \u201cUnder the House bill, 14 million Americans would lose coverage next year. That rises to 24 million over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe CBO estimated that under the GOP replacement bill, 14 million fewer people would be insured in 2018 than under the current health-care law and 24 million fewer people would be insured by 2026.\n\nBut this does not mean all of the 14 million or 24 million will be \u201ckicked off\u201d health insurance or \u201close\u201d health insurance.\n\nMany of the people who would be uninsured, at least initially, would choose not to have insurance, because they had decided to obtain coverage only to avoid a penalty under the ACA\u2019s individual mandate; the replacement bill would eliminate the mandate. Others, such as elderly Americans, would not get insurance because the premiums are too high. (The replacement bill would allow the elderly to be charged five times as much as the youngest insured, compared with a 3:1 ratio under the ACA.) Many of the uninsured people would lose insurance because of reductions in Medicaid enrollment \u2014 after some states discontinue the Medicaid expansion under the ACA.\n\nThe CBO estimated that the GOP bill would lead to 14 million fewer people insured than under the ACA by 2018. Six million of those 14 million would be people who now have coverage through the individual insurance market; 5 million would be people with coverage under Medicaid; and 2 million would be people with coverage through their employers, which also would no longer be required to provide insurance. (The remainder come from other insurance shifts.)\n\nThe Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false.
