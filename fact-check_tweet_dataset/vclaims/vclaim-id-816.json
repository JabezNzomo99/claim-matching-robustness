But Politico said McConnell gave Trump a \u201clukewarm endorsement.\u201d The Washington Post called it \u201ctepid.\u201d\n\u2022 Reid claimed McConnell\u2019s support for Trump is so strong that \u201cyou can only assume he agrees with Trump\u2019s view that women are dogs and pigs.\u201d But Reid applies false logic (McConnell\u2019s endorsement equals support for all of Trump\u2019s statements) to arrive at a faulty conclusion (McConnell agrees women are dogs and pigs).\n\u2022 The Nevada Democrat also said Trump\u2019s \u201cpolicy positions are identical to the Republican Party platform.\u201d They are not identical, which is the reason House Speaker Paul Ryan has yet to endorse Trump. There are major differences on entitlements, foreign policy and trade, for example.\n\nReid made his remarks on the Senate floor on the day that Trump was in Washington to meet with Ryan. The likely Republican standard-bearer later met with McConnell.\n\nFirst some background: The Senate Democrats have already begun to use guilt by association to tie all Republican Senate candidates to Trump\u2019s policies and statements. The Hill reported in March on a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Web video that \u201cintersperses clips of some of Trump\u2019s incendiary remarks \u2014 with a lot of foul language bleeped out \u2014 with clips of incumbents and House members running for Senate saying they\u2019ll support Trump if he\u2019s the party\u2019s nominee.\u201d\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at what McConnell has said about Trump.\n\nMcConnell endorsed his fellow Kentuckian, Sen. Rand Paul, for president, not Trump. After Paul dropped out, McConnell didn\u2019t endorse any of the other remaining candidates.\n\nWhen it became clear that Trump would be the nominee, McConnell announced in a statement on May 4 that he would support Trump. \u201cOn Wednesday evening, 24 hours after Trump won the Indiana primary and knocked out his remaining presidential contenders, McConnell released a tepid statement saying he would support the nominee,\u201d the Washington Post reported.\n\nPolitico called it both \u201ctepid\u201d and \u201clukewarm,\u201d noting that McConnell issued a statement rather than holding a press conference.\n\nThe Hill, in its story on the endorsement, also noted McConnell\u2019s backing was expected, despite his \u201cskepticism of Trump.\u201d The Hill wrote, \u201cWhile McConnell had made his skepticism of Trump clear throughout the raucous primary, he also always said he would back the eventual nominee.\u201d\n\nThe Hill described some of the Senate leader\u2019s differences with Trump.\n\nMcConnell clearly does not endorse everything that Trump has said or done, so Reid cannot \u201cassume he agrees with Trump\u2019s view that women are dogs and pigs.\u201d (For more on what exactly Trump called some of his female adversaries \u2014 not all women \u2014 see our Aug. 11, 2015, story \u201cTrump\u2019s Amnesia.\u201d)\n\nReid, of course, knows better. During his own reelection campaign in 2010, Reid criticized President Obama when the president warned families about wasting money in Las Vegas casinos instead of saving for family expenses, such as college tuition. \u201cThe president needs to lay off Las Vegas and stop making it the poster child for where people shouldn\u2019t be spending their money,\u201d Reid said at the time.\n\nIt is true that McConnell, whose primary focus is maintaining control of the Senate, seemed cheered by Quinnipiac University polls that showed Trump was doing well in three swing states where the Republicans are battling to hold on to Senate seats. CNN quoted McConnell as saying, \u201cIt looks to me like at the beginning of the race, Florida and Pennsylvania and Ohio look pretty competitive. It\u2019s a long time until November, but the early indications are that our nominee is likely to be very competitive.\u201d\n\nBut Reid takes McConnell\u2019s hope that Trump is competitive in key swing states as a sign that the Republican leader is now \u201centhusiastically embracing\u201d Trump. Reid goes even further to assume this enthusiasm for Trump is because the likely nominee\u2019s policies are \u201cidentical to the Republican Party platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile speaking with reporters earlier this week, the Republican leader even sounded enthusiastic about Trump\u2019s chances in the general election,\u201d Reid said in his floor speech. \u201cI guess he should be giddy about a Trump presidency. Donald Trump is everything that the Republican leader and his party could ever want in a nominee. His policy positions are identical to the Republican Party platform.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s policy positions are not \u201cidentical to the Republican Party platform.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post back in August listed numerous instances in which Trump has taken positions at odds with the 2012 Republican platform, and more recently so did the Daily Caller and the New York Times.\n\nHere are some examples where Trump\u2019s positions are at odds with the party platform:\n\nTrade: The 2012 platform praises free trade agreements for creating \u201cnearly 10 million jobs,\u201d and called for implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In an op-ed, Trump has blamed trade pacts for costing millions of jobs and singled out the TPP as \u201cthe biggest betrayal in a long line of betrayals where politicians have sold out U.S. workers.\u201d\n\nNuclear weapons: The party platform calls for \u201cpreventing the spread of those armaments,\u201d while Trump has said \u201cmaybe it\u2019s not so bad\u201d if Japan had a nuclear weapon, and South Korea too, to deter North Korea.\n\nEntitlement programs: As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan repeatedly has proposed budgets that include significant changes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The party platform agrees on the need for \u201cmajor structural reforms\u201d to entitlement programs to balance the budget. But Trump has criticized Ryan\u2018s budget proposals on entitlements as the reason why the Republicans lost the White House in 2012 when Ryan was on the ticket. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d Trump has vowed.\n\nReid is no doubt eager to tie Senate Republicans to Trump, but in this instance the Democratic leader twisted the facts to do so.", "lang": "en"}
