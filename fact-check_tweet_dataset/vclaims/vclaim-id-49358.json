The handle belonged to a BJP leader, by the same name, based in Uttar Pradesh. On scanning through his post, we realised that he is the same person whose pictures are going viral.\n\nIn a post, he clarified that he is the chairman of the BJP Kanpur-Bundelkhand region. He also said that he will be filing a complaint against people who are sharing such fake posts.\n\nMoreover, the picture of gangster Vikas Dubey is noticeably very different from the BJP leader Vikas Dubey.\n\nHence, from the above information, we can conclude that the posts in circulation are misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
