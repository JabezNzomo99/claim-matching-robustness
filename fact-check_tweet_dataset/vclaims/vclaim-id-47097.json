The tweet has a video of Rahul Gandhi and the text \u2018Thank you @RahulGandhi for speaking in favour of my country\u2019. Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Chinese journalist \u2018Wang Wenwen\u2019 tweeted thanking Rahul Gandhi for speaking in favour of China. Fact: The official Twitter handle of Chinese journalist \u2018Wang Wenwen\u2019 is \u2018@WenwenWang1127\u2019, not \u2018@WangChinaR\u2019. So the tweet thanking Rahul Gandhi is not from \u2018Wang Wenwen\u2019s\u2019 official Twitter account. Also, in the video in that tweet, Rahul Gandhi hasn\u2019t spoken anything supporting China. Hence the claim made is FALSE.\n\n\u2018Wang Wenwen\u2019 is the Chief reporter and opinion writer of \u2018Global Times\u2019. The official Twitter handle of \u2018Wang Wenwen\u2019 is \u2018@WenwenWang1127\u2019, not \u2018@WangChinaR\u2019.\n\nThe tweet from \u2018@WangChinaR\u2019 seen in the screenshot has a video of Rahul Gandhi speaking about the recent faceoff between India and China. In the video, Rahul Gandhi asks PM Narendra Modi why is he silent on the death of 20 Indian soldiers and China\u2019s attempts to grab Indian territory. Nowhere in the video, Rahul Gandhi mentioned anything supporting China as described in the tweet. Also, this twitter profile is created very recently in April 2020 and started tweeting only since 16 June 2020.\n\nTo sum it up, a fake Twitter handle (@WangChinaR) in the name of Chinese journalist \u2018Wang Wenwen\u2019 (@WenwenWang112) tweeted thanking Rahul Gandhi for his support towards China.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
