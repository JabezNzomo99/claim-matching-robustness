However, photographs from Getty Images and The Associated Press show that this statue was not damaged or grafittied during these protests.\n\nBelow is a photograph of the Lincoln Memorial taken on June 6. While it would be hypothetically possible for the statue to be cleaned in a day (if, that is, it was ever defaced in the first place), the above-displayed image claims that the head of the statue was damaged. As we can see in the following photograph, that simply isn\u2019t the case:\n\nWhile the top image is undoubtedly fake, there were some instances of monuments or statues being graffitied during these protests. The National Park Service sent out a series of images supposedly showing this damage:\n\nIn fact, the picture on the top left of the National Park Service\u2019s tweet does show graffiti (\u201cyall not tired yet\u201d) on the steps leading up to the Lincoln Memorial. But this marking was quickly cleaned up by federal workers, according to The Blaze, and in the following days, the Lincoln Memorial was heavily protected by members of the National Guard.\n\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, here\u2019s a fake photograph circulating on social media purporting to show the damage done by protesters (left), and a genuine marking left on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial after a protest (right):", "lang": "en"}
