Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen searched with the keywords \u201cNizam\u2019s 5000 kg gold donation\u201d on Google, a \u2018The Hindu\u2019 article on this issue can be found in the search results. According to the article, the government responded to an RTI query on this issue saying that it has no information on any such donation from Nizam. The same article provides information about an investment of 425 kg of gold by Nizam in National Defence Gold Scheme, which was floated in 1965 to overcome the economic crisis. So, Nizam did not make 5000 kg gold donation; he just made some investments (425 kg, not 5000 kg) into a Gold scheme which had an interest rate of 6.5 per cent.\n\nClaim 2: Modi has used the 280 tonnes of the country\u2019s gold as collateral. Fact: India\u2019s gold reserves are stored with the RBI. It clarified that no gold was shifted by RBI to other countries in 2014 or thereafter. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the issue on Google, it was found that RBI\u2019s Chief General Manager Yogesh Dayal issued a press release to counter the media reports on this issue. In the press release, he said, \u201cWe have come across reports in certain sections of the print and social media regarding RBI shifting abroad a part of its gold holding in 2014. It is a normal practice for Central Banks world over, to keep their gold reserves overseas with Central Banks of other countries like Bank of England for safe custody. It is further stated that no gold was shifted by the RBI from India to other countries in 2014 or thereafter. Thus the media reports cited above are factually incorrect.\u201d So, Modi did not use the country\u2019s gold as collateral.\n\nTo sum it up, Modi did not transfer 280 kg of the country\u2019s gold for use as collateral.", "lang": "en"}
