No, that's not true, at least the part about a suspect being arrested. The robbery and kidnapping did take place but the story about the arrest was made up by a \"fauxtire\" site that fabricates stories in order to make money from advertising. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on July 22, 2018 titled \"1 Suspect Caught For The Robbing And Kidnapping Of Tekashi69 After Trying To Pawn Jewelry\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nMichael Bigson 45, was caught earlier today while trying to pawn the jewelry he was told to wait while one of the manager called the police after he recognized the jewelry of be of rapper Tekashi 69. Tekashi 69 who already suffers from mental retardation is in stable condition but doctors will perform more CT scans.\n\nThe rest of the article is mostly copied from a real TMZ report about Tekashi69 being robbed (which has already been updated with a different version of the incident):\n\nTekashi69 Pistol Whipped, Kidnapped, Robbed and Hospitalized Tekashi69 was kidnapped, pistol whipped and robbed and is now in the hospital ... TMZ has learned. Sources close to Tekashi tell us, the rapper was working on a music video in Brooklyn early Sunday morning and at around 4AM he wrapped for the night and drove home.\n\nBut the picture of the suspect has been circulating online since at least 2012 in various galleries containing weird mugshots:\n\nAnd Huzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman Who Hasn't Had Sex In 120 Days Did NOT Crash Car Just To Feel Choked Again\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Tranquilizing And Raping Alligators In Everglades\n\u2022 Fake News: McDonald's Manager Did NOT Shoot Man For Putting Soda In His Free Water Cup\n\u2022 Fake News: White Woman Did NOT Call Cops On Innocent Man Selling Crack Cocaine Outside Her Apartment\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Alabama Man In Custody After Promising Kids V-Bucks, Did NOT Sexually Abuse Them", "lang": "en"}
