This is false; Buttigieg was speaking about giving people a choice between public and private options, not expressing indifference about them losing existing coverage.\n\n\u201cDemocrat Pete Buttigieg on whether 180 million Americans lose the health insurance plans they get through their jobs because of Medicare for All: \u2018To be honest, I don't care,\u2019\u201d an account managed by Trump\u2019s campaign said in a tweet, which has also been shared on Facebook.\n\nIt includes a video clip in which Buttigieg says: \u201cThe question of whether it leaves private insurance intact, that\u2019s actually up to the insurance companies. Either they\u2019ll come up with something better that\u2019ll compete with the plan I\u2019m putting out there, or they\u2019ll fail. And to be honest, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe clip is of Buttigieg speaking in Salt Lake City, Utah on February 17, 2020. He was outlining his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan, not the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan of some of his Democratic rivals.\n\nIn Buttigieg\u2019s remarks on the issue -- which start at the 25:22 minute mark in this video -- he advocates having a public health insurance option, but giving people the flexibility to choose between it and private plans.\n\n\u201cI think my plan\u2019ll be the best plan of all. If I\u2019m right, everybody\u2019ll pick it, and pretty soon it\u2019ll be Medicare for All. But I\u2019m not willing to assume or dictate that it\u2019s gonna be the best plan for you -- I want you to figure it out on your own,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cInstead of deciding from Washington when you\u2019re gonna make that change, we let you figure it out on your own,\u201d Buttigieg says, then going into the remarks from the clip tweeted by the Trump campaign-managed account.\n\nImmediately after the comments from the clip end, he says: \u201cThe purpose of my plan is not to see to it that the government is your health insurer. The purpose of my plan is to see to it that you get insurance one way or the other, and there\u2019s no such thing as an uninsured American.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance is a key issue as Democratic candidates vie for their party\u2019s nomination. Some -- including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are pushing for universal government-provided coverage, while others such as Buttigieg favor incremental changes.", "lang": "en"}
