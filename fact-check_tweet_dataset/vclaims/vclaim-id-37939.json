One of those quotes is attributed to the Guardian:\n\n\u201cLib Dems winning and on the up after by-election victory.\u201d\n\nBut, as Heather Stewart pointed out, those are the words of Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, not the Guardian.\n\nAfter the Liberal Democrats won the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election in early August, Ms Swinson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cThere is another positive alternative that is the Liberal Democrats who are winning again and on the up.\u201d\n\nThose words were reported in the Guardian, who also paraphrased Ms Swinson\u2019s comments in the headline of the piece:\n\n\u201cJo Swinson: Lib Dems winning and on the up after byelection victory\u201d\n\nIn their campaign leaflet, the Lib Dems edited the headline to remove the reference to Jo Swinson, falsely presenting it instead as a direct quote from the Guardian.\n\nThis is misleading and irresponsible. As we said yesterday when fact checking a Conservative video which had been misleadingly edited, everyone deserves clear and accurate information from campaigns so they can make their own minds up about who to vote for.", "lang": "en"}
