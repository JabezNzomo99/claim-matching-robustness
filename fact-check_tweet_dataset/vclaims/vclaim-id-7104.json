A male suspect is in custody.\n\nThe gunman is believed to be among the roughly 1,400 students at Santa Fe High School, about 36 miles southeast of Houston. The shooter opened fire inside the school around 7:45 a.m. local time, according to school district officials.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a May 18 press conference the shooter used a shotgun and a .38-caliber revolver to carry out his attack. Abbott said the weapons belonged to the suspect\u2019s father.\n\nSeveral talking points and misinformation surfaced in the hours after the attack. Here\u2019s what we found.\n\nAs details of the shooting began to emerge, several broadcasters and Twitter users described the incident at Santa Fe High School as the 22nd school shooting of 2018.\n\n\"Including today\u2019s shooting incident at a Texas high school, this year there have already been 22 school shootings where someone was hurt or killed,\" CNN tweeted, along with a graphic. \"That averages out to more than 1 shooting a week.\"\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted in previous fact-checks, the number of school shootings tallied depends on how narrowly or broadly one defines a school shooting.\n\nCNN described its criteria as a shooting that occured on school grounds that involved at least one person being shot (excluding the shooter). Accidental shootings were also counted. The network included grades kindergarten through college, and did not make exceptions for gang violence, fights or domestic violence.\n\nOne count widely cited in the news media comes from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group co-founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that seeks to prevent gun violence.\n\nThe group defines a school shooting \"any time a firearm discharges a live round inside or into a school building or on or onto a school campus or grounds, as documented by the press and, when necessary, confirmed through further inquiries with law enforcement or school officials. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not discharged are not included.\"\n\nUsing Everytown\u2019s count, more than 40 school shootings have occurred in 2018.\n\nSocial media accounts for the suspect were pulled on Facebook and Instagram. Law enforcement said the shooter had posted a \"born to kill\" T-shirt before the shooting.\n\nBut copycats started popping up once his name was reported.\n\nOne fake Facebook profile depicted the alleged gunman wearing a hat showing support for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential bid, with a background photo displaying a banner espousing anti-fascists, or Antifa, views.\n\nMultiple Twitter users pointed out the profile pic appears to have been uploaded a little after 1:30 p.m., Eastern time \u2014 hours after the gunman was taken into custody. The profile has been deleted.\n\nAnother apparently fake account bearing the alleged shooter\u2019s name appeared on Instagram (the account has since been deleted). Like the phony Facebook profile, this account also uploaded posts several hours after the suspected gunman\u2019s apprehension, including one post commenting on the shooting:\n\nOne student, Paige Curry, 17, avoided eye contact with an ABC 13 reporter as he asked, \"Was there a part of you that was like, this isn\u2019t real, this would not happen in my school?\"\n\n\"No there wasn\u2019t,\" she replied. \"It's been happening everywhere. I've always kind of felt like eventually it was going to happen here too. So, I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t surprised. I was just scared. \"\n\nA Twitter user called her a \"crisis actor\" and the shooting a hoax while another accused her of reading from a script. Neither claim is proven.\n\nLaura Loomer, a far-right activist, questioned the timing of the shooting following safety drills at the school and hospital in two tweets.\n\n\"The doctor speaking to media outside the hospital in Santa Fe, TX where victims of a school shooting were taken today said they just had a \u2018mass casualty drill\u2019 at the hospital around the same time of the school drill. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t help but notice these \u2018coincidences.\u2019\"\n\nThere is no evidence that the May 18 shooting was connected to such drills at the school or hospital. It\u2019s common for schools to hold what\u2019s commonly called \"lock-down drills,\" in which students and staff remain indoors to practice securing themselves in the event of an incident such as a shooting.\n\nThe majority of schools hold drills on lockdown procedures, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nVox reported after the February mass shooting in Parkland that since Columbine \"32 states have passed laws requiring schools to conduct lockdown drills or some form of emergency drill to keep students safe from intruders\" while six states require specific \"active shooter\" drills each year.\n\nRaul Reyes, a spokesman for the University of Texas Medical Branch, told TV reporters on the scene that \"we just had a mass casualty drill several weeks ago. They are very well prepared. They are very well organized. They make sure that everybody knows their job.\"\n\nReyes told PolitiFact in an interview that the recent drill he was referring to several weeks ago was actually a part of nationwide ebola drills. However, he said that the hospital regularly rotates through a variety of drills, including how to handle victims from a mass casualty situation, how to address an active shooter situation on their hospital campus, and even chemical spill drills because of the proximity to ship channel refineries in Houston.\n\nLoomer\u2019s tweet is nonsense, he said. \"We\u2019re a level one trauma center. We always drill so that we\u2019re prepared for tragic days like this.\"", "lang": "en"}
