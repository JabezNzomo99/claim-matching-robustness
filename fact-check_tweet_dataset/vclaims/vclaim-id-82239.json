(Go to Table 4.) The report looked at the impact of repealing the law, so essentially you have to reverse the numbers. (In other words, read anything with a minus sign as positive, and anything with no sign as negative.)\n\nThe CBO calculated that from 2016 to 2025, the law would require $1.7 trillion in outlays (spending) while raising revenues (taxes) of $1.2 trillion. But the CBO also calculated that the law pays for itself \u2014 and reduces the federal deficit over the 10-year period \u2014 because the taxes, $800 billion in savings from Medicare and other provisions, exceed the $1.7 trillion price tag.\n\nObviously, the cost of health care generally goes up every year, though the rate of increase has slowed dramatically in recent years. Democrats stress this, but at this point it\u2019s hard to give most of the credit to the health-care law. (We once gave President Obama Three Pinocchios for making this claim too emphatically.)\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are being disingenuous for assuming the law was going to result in an actual decrease in costs. In their defense, they point to some Pinocchio-laden statements made by Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nThe \u201cnearly 5 million people losing their health plans\u201d comes from an Associated Press count in 2013 of the number of people who received notifications that their old policies were no longer valid under the law because it did not meet certain standards. (Recall that Obama had famously \u2014 and falsely \u2014 promised that if people liked their plans, they could keep them.)\n\nOn top of that, the White House ordered an administrative fix that, depending on the actions of individual states, allowed as many as 2.3 million people with \u201ccanceled plans\u201d to simply stay on their old plans for at least another year. (Then the White House extended that deadline to 2016.) The administration also announced a new catastrophic exemption to fill any remaining gaps in coverage \u2014 estimated to affect as many as 500,000 people.\n\nAs for premium increases of more than 50 percent, Perry is relying on a conservative analysis of the individual market which compares pre-law plans with fewer benefits to current law plans. The Kaiser Family Foundation this week released an early analysis of plans in 10 states plus the District of Columbia and found that, on average, the cost of a benchmark silver plan would be 4.4 percent higher in 2016.\n\nObama in 2008 claimed that a health care overhaul would result in family savings of $2,500, compared to anticipated increases in premiums. In other words, he was not promising a cut in premiums, as Cruz claimed. Still, it was a foolish pledge, for which he received Pinocchios from The Fact Checker because it was based on a series of shaky assumptions.\n\nThe president is referring to a provision in the law to slowly close a gap in Medicare prescription-drug coverage known as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d by 2020. (Beneficiaries previously had to pay the full cost out of pocket before catastrophic coverage took effect.) Obama took his numbers from a 2015 Health and Human Services Department report that calculated the savings thus far; we have not vetted the methodology yet.\n\nWe have previously provided a lengthy explanation of this $1,800 figure, which is derived from the same Kaiser study from which Cruz obtained his \u201c$3,000\u201d figure. But in this case the White House focused on what premiums would have been if they had continued on the same path of premium growth from 2000 to 2010.\n\nWhen we examined this in depth, the president earned Two Pinocchios for two key reasons. First, he had called it a \u201ctax cut\u201d of $1,800, when it\u2019s unclear how much of this money actually ends up in an employee\u2019s pocket. The \u201cyou\u2019re still paying\u201d language has the same problem. For all one knows, employers are pocketing the savings.\n\nMoreover, Obama appears to be attributing the entire slowdown in cost increases to the Affordable Care Act\u2013and the jury is still out on that. The slowdown in health-care costs has to be viewed in context \u2014 as the economic growth and price inflation was lower in the aftermath of the Great Recession. (Health care costs slowed around the globe, even in countries with no changes in health care laws.) So attributing the full $1,800 figure to the law is a stretch.", "lang": "en"}
