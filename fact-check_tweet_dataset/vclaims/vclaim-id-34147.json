This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy though. But I don't know him well.\"\n\nSondland and Trump are hardly strangers. In October, Trump tweeted that he \"would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify.\"\n\nDuring Sondland\u2019s testimony, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., read Trump\u2019s comments aloud and asked Sondland if he knew the president well. Sondland said they were not \"close friends\" but have a \"professional, cordial working relationship.\"\n\nHere, we\u2019ll take a look at Sondland\u2019s relationship with the president and the conversations they had concerning Ukraine.\n\nTrump nominated Sondland to his diplomatic post to the European Union, and the Senate confirmed him in June 2018.\n\nBefore that, Sondland worked in the hotel industry. He founded Provenance Hotels.\n\nAs Trump noted on the White House lawn, Sondland preferred other presidential candidates in 2016 and distanced himself from Trump, citing Trump\u2019s criticism of a Gold Star family. At one point, Sondland withdrew his name from a fundraising event for Trump, according to Willamette Week, a local news website in Portland, Ore.\n\nBut Sondland also donated \u2014 through four limited liability companies \u2014 $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThere are numerous photos of the Sondand and Trump together, including aboard Air Force One.\n\nBut Sondland said his conversations with Trump have been limited.\n\n\"I haven\u2019t had that many communications with the president,\" he said in public testimony. \"I really can\u2019t give you an accurate count of how many conversations. Plus, Mr. Castor, I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with the president about completely unrelated matters that have nothing to do with Ukraine.\"\n\n\"I had occasional access when he chose to take my calls,\" Sondland said at another point.\n\nAsked to estimate the number of conversations he has had with Trump, Sondland said the two have spoken roughly 20 times. He said he couldn\u2019t be sure because the White House has not turned over all his call records; Sondland said several times he is not a notetaker.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is joined by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union as he arrives at Air Force One in Brussels, Belgium, on July 10, 2018. (AP/Monsivais)\n\nSondland highlighted a few interactions with the president.\n\nIn person at the White House: Sondland said he helped brief Trump on Ukraine after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration on May 23, when Trump instructed the room to \"talk to Rudy,\" meaning Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nCall before Zelensky conversation: Sondland said he called Trump on July 25, shortly before Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky.\n\nCall after Zelensky conversation: Sondland spoke with Trump by phone for five minutes on July 26 while at a restaurant with David Holmes, a diplomat at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine. Sondland said he could not recall its substance, but that he had no reason to doubt that it included the subject of investigations.\n\nHolmes previously testified that he could hear both ends of the call, and Trump asked Sondland if Zelensky was prepared to announce the investigations he wanted. According to Holmes, Sondland told Trump that Zelensky was willing and that he \"loves your ass.\"\n\n\"It sounds like something I would say,\" Sondland said in his Nov. 20 testimony, laughing. \"That\u2019s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words, in this case three-letter.\"\n\nPhone call Sept. 9: Sondland also told Ambassador William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, that he had spoken with Trump by phone in a Sept. 9 text message.\n\nAfter Taylor wrote that he thought it was \"crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Sondland replied, \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\"\n\n\"I finally called the president, I believe it was on the 9th of September,\" Sondland later testified.\n\n\"It was a very short, abrupt conversation,\" Sondland said. \"He was not in a good mood. And he just said, \u2018I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.\u2019\"\n\nSondland also said he might have spoken with Trump on Sept. 6, as well.\n\nThe Trump campaign declined to comment, and the White House did not respond to our inquiry by deadline.", "lang": "en"}
