This story mimics earlier reports that have circulated for at least a year.\n\nShortly before Trump\u2019s inauguration, a similar story surfaced on therightists.com that said celebrities were calling for a strike within the movie industry in hopes that it would urge Trump to resign.\n\nSnopes found that the rumor stemmed from an ad in the New York Times by the group Refuse Fascism. The group, which included O\u2019Donnell, called for millions to hold a protest to \"create a political crisis that prevents the Trump/Pence fascist regime from consolidating its hold on the governance of society.\" Thousands of people, including musicians, actors, professors and authors, signed the petition as of Jan. 6, 2017.\n\nThe celebrities were not calling for a strike barring Trump\u2019s resignation.\n\nO'Donnell told NBC Late Night host Seth Meyers in November 2017 that she has been in a \"severe depression\" since Trump won the presidency and that she spends \"90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred towards\" Trump.\n\nThe pair have bad blood going back to O\u2019Donnell\u2019s time on ABC\u2019s The View, when she criticized Trump on multiple personal and professional fronts after his decision not to fire a Miss USA accused of drug use and other wrongdoing.\n\nWe messaged O\u2019Donnell on Facebook to ask if she had threatened to strike and received an automated message: \"Please use my memes and articles as a resource to fight against Trump. I read all of my messages. #LoveTrumpsHate #ResistTrump Please don't leave hateful comments or memes on my page. Stay Rosie.\"\n\nSo Nourtey.com said, \"Hollywood celebs: We will go on \u2018total strike\u2019 if Trump does not resign.\" While O\u2019Donnell was among the celebrities who signed a Refuse Fascism petition calling for protests leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration and has continued to criticize Trump, we found no evidence that there was a plan for a mass strike among celebrities.
