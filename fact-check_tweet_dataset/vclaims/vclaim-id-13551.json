The website notes that, \u2018The Congress-led UPA has always considered the safety and security of each and every citizen of the country with paramount importance. The ten years of UPA rule saw a considerable increase in expenditure on national security and defence, with an increase from 77,000 crore in 2004-05 to 1,93,407 crore in 2012-13.\u2019\n\nWas there a substantial increase in Defence expenditure during the UPA?\n\n The then finance minister while presenting the 2012-13 budget stated that, \u2018In the Budget for 2012-13, a provision of 1,93,407 crore has been made for Defence Services which include 79,579 crore for capital expenditure.\u2019\n\nWhile presenting the budget of 2004-05, the then finance minister stated that, \u2018Having high regard to the trend of defence capital expenditure in recent years, it has become necessary to make a higher allocation this year. Accordingly, I propose to increase the allocation for defence to Rs. 77,000 crore (as against Rs. 65,300 crores in BE 2003-04)\u2019\n\nIt has to be noted that these numbers are only allocations made and hence the actual expenditure could have been more or less than the allocated amount. We compiled the budget expenditure on the defence sector from 1998-99 (since NDA\u2019s first term). The revised estimate was available from 1998-99 to 2007-08 while the actual expenditure was available from 2008-09 to 2016-17.\n\nThe figures show that there has been a continuous increase in the allocation & expenditure on defence with every budget barring 2002-03. This is inline with increasing budget size every year. The allocation for the last few years do not include OROP expenditure. It also has to be noted that the figures mentioned on the Congress website are only allocations and not actual expenditure. For instance, the actual expenditure in 2012-13 was Rs 1,81,776 crores and not Rs 1,93,407 crores.\n\nIn terms of the increase in allocation for this sector, it has been up and down over the years. The allocation increased by over 20% compared to the previous year only on three (3) occasions in the last 19 years. In the last nine years (both during the UPA 2 & the current government), the increase is less than 12%.\n\nClaim: The ten years of UPA rule saw a considerable increase in expenditure on national security and defence, with an increase from 77,000 crore in 2004-05 to 1,93,407 crore in 2012-13. Fact: What is mentioned by the Congress on its website is only allocation and not actual expenditure. The actual expenditure in 2012-13 is less than the allocation. It also has to be noted that the allocation for the defence sector has been increasing every year. Hence, the claim is only PARTLY TRUE.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
