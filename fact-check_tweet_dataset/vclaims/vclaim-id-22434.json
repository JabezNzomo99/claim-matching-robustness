Opinion polls showed that some 90% of Russians oppose the changes, which triggered protest rallies throughout the country.\n\nPutin\u2019s latest comments, experts say, were \u201cfull of inaccuracies and propaganda.\u201d\n\nAmong the most important things left out of Putin\u2019s speech were the future of Russia\u2019s pension funds and the sustainability of the pension system as whole, wrote Anton Tabakh, lead economist with the Expert PA rating agency, in an analysis for the Russian business news agency RBC.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that without the development of voluntary retirement funds and without a decision about the fate of the required retirement funds, the older generations will remain doomed to poverty and the economy doomed to a lack of financial resources,\u201d Tabakh wrote.\n\nVladimir Milov, a leading Russian economist and Putin critic, said that the president based his speech on a \u201cpropaganda trick\u201d and that his numbers do not add up.\n\nAmong other things, Milov took issue with the Russian president\u2019s apparent dismissal of the idea of instituting a \u201cprogressive income tax scale\u201d to help finance pensions.\n\nPutin said in the speech: \u201cAccording to Finance Ministry estimates, \u2026increased tax rates, for example, 20 percent on higher incomes, can fetch about 75\u2013120 billion rubles a year, and that is not even for certain. This amount will last us six days at best. Because paying pensions in Russia requires 20 billion rubles daily. I would like to emphasize that this is our daily requirement.\u201d\n\nBy way of rebuttal, Milov wrote on Facebook that \u201cin fact, those \u2018six days\u2019 are ALL COSTS FOR THE PAYMENT OF PENSIONS, divided by 365 days -- that is, the entire budget of the Pension Fund today (8.4 trillion rubles, divided by 365 days, roughly speaking equal the 20 billion per day of which he spoke).\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the Pension Fund budget on the whole is balanced, and the money is already there! 4.5 trillion (rubles) are collected in the form of salary contributions, the rest is subsidies from the federal budget. There's nothing to cover,\u201d Milov said.\n\nWhile state media portrayed the president\u2019s speech as a significant \u201csoftening\u201d of the proposed reform, it was met with a harsh criticism in social media.\n\nMany posts accused Vladimir Putin of \u201clying\u201d and \u201cstealing\u201d from his own constituencies.\n\nThe pension reform is a politically sensitive issue and has been the subject of heated discussion, with the nation\u2019s top economic officials stating that it was not on the table as recently as this past March, when Putin was re-elected for his official third presidential term.", "lang": "en"}
