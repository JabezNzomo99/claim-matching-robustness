March 14, 2019.\n\nNSW Arts Minister Don Harwin and Nationals leader John Barilaro approved over $3 million in grants in coalition-held seats for 13 regional arts projects judged ineligible by an expert panel.\n\nIndependent candidate for Tamworth and local councillor Mark Rodda said the funding process was unfair and \u201can appalling way to manage taxpayers' funds prior to an election\". [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Rodda\u2019s claim it was \"a classic case of pork-barrelling\".\n\nAccording to the Macquarie Dictionary pork-barrelling is a colloquial expression for \u201ca government appropriation, bill or policy which supplies funds for local improvements designed to ingratiate legislators with their constituents\u201d.\n\nA NSW Government Planning and Environment document obtained by the ABC under freedom of information, and shared by the national broadcaster with AAP FactCheck, shows how funding applications for Regional Cultural Fund (RCF) grants were assessed and allocated. The document consists of 199 pages. [2]\n\nPage 10 of the document states the NSW Arts Minister Don Harwin had identified 13 applications that were \u201cnot recommended\u201d by the RCF panel for funding. The document states the minister then sought advice on whether to allocate funding to these 13 applications and asked \u201cwhat conditions would be needed to ensure the applications met the objective of the RCF panel\u201d. [2]\n\nPage 82 of the document identifies 13 applications \u201cnot recommended\u201d for funding and shows they were all for projects in NSW coalition-held seats. [2]\n\nIn May 31, 2018 when round one of RCF grants were announced, 68 projects shared $48 million worth of funding, included 13 that had not been recommended for funding by the panel. [3]\n\nPremier Gladys Berejiklian, Deputy Premier John Barilaro, Mr Harwin and National Party whip and Myall Lakes MP Stephen Bromhead announced the round one RCF recipients at the Manning Entertainment Centre in Taree which is in the NSW seat of Myall Lakes. The Manning Entertainment Centre was one of the 13 applications \u201cnot recommended\u201d but it received the most funding with two grants totalling $1,570,959. [4]\n\nHere\u2019s the 13 \u201cnot recommended\u201d projects which received funding, listed from the largest to smallest grants together with which electoral seat they came from and who holds the seat [2] [5].\n\n4: Pru Goward, Liberals, Minister for Family and Community Services; Social Housing; Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault; Goulburn MP: Berrima District Historical & Family History Society Inc., Berrima District Museum Masterplan project. ($113,324)\n\n8: Daryl Maguire, Nationals, Wagga Wagga MP (at time of grant announcement in May 2018): Batlow Development League, Building upgrades. ($44,393)\n\n9: Melinda Pavey, Nationals, Minister for Roads, Maritime and Freight; Oxley MP: Nambucca Community and Arts Centre Committee of Management, Centre upgrades. ($40,534)\n\n12: Adam Marshall, Nationals, Minister for Tourism and Major Events; Assistant Minister for Skills; Northern Tablelands MP: Uralla Shire Council, Aboriginal Cultural Display. ($16,196)\n\nThe biggest winners among the 13 were the National Party whip Stephen Bromhead\u2019s seat of Myall Lakes, which received four grants totalling $1,679,274, and the Deputy Premier John Barilaro\u2019s seat of Monaro, which got two grants totalling $1,039,000. [2] [5]\n\nTamworth candidate and councillor Mr Rodda told AAP FactCheck: \u201cWhat Mr Harwin did is pure pork-barrelling in coalition seats to sandbag and protect the government incumbents at this election. It is completely unfair to the councils and organisations elsewhere who do the right thing to plan their projects only to have the minister pull the rug from underneath those groups.\u201d\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes Mr Rodda claim the NSW government is guilty of pork-barrelling is true and that his use of the term pork-barrelling is in line with the Macquarie Dictionary definition.", "lang": "en"}
