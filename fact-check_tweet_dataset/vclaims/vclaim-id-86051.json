First, he uses an unusual number of years\u2014eight, instead of five or ten. Second, there is the use of the word \u201ctotal,\u201d which suggests it is a raw number, not a relative number.\n\nWhy eight? In theory, that\u2019s because the president set 2005 as his benchmark for his 2009 pledge that by 2020, the United States would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels. But of course 2005 was a bit of a cherry-picked number to begin with\u2014the high point of U.S. carbon emissions. When the president made his announcement, carbon emissions had begun to fall because of the Great Recession.\n\nA more traditional starting point for calculating progress on emissions is 1990, the date set in the Kyoto Protocol. Obama\u2019s 17 percent pledge shrinks to as little as 3 percent from a 1990 baseline\u2013while many European countries have already cut much more from that level.\n\nUsing preliminary data for 2013 calculated by the Global Carbon Project, one sees that on an absolute basis, the United States comes out on top over the past eight years, with a reduction of 589 billion metric tons since 2005. That amounts to a decline of 10.1 percent. (For what it\u2019s worth, the administration actually uses most recent official data to 2011, from the Energy Information Administration, and then assumes the gap between the United States and the next closest country, Germany, continues until 2013.)\n\nBut until recently the United States was the world\u2019s biggest emitter of pollution, so a raw number doesn\u2019t tell you that much when comparing the performance with other countries. While countries such as China, India, Russia and South Korea have all had an increase in carbon emissions since 2005, there are several major countries that also experienced declines larger than 10 percent. Emissions fell 12.2 percent in France, 25.3 percent in Italy and 32 percent in Spain.\n\nMoreover, the struggling worldwide economy has played an important role in these numbers. Indeed, Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged this in a speech to the Wharton School on Monday: \u201cWhile the recession was responsible for about half of these [U.S.] emissions reductions, the other half\u2014which is still a large amount\u2014is the result of the changing ways in which we produce and consume energy.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Obama also said: \u201cWe now harness three times as much electricity from the wind and 10 times as much from the sun as we did when I came into office.\u201d\n\nHere, of course, he is using relative numbers, as that makes the numbers look impressive. But when you dig into the data, from the Energy Information Administration, it\u2019s clear that both wind and solar power started from very small bases in 2009\u2014and still make up only a small part of the overall energy picture. Experts also say that much of the credit for the increase belongs to state governments, 30 of which have adopted renewable portfolio standards requiring utilities to get certain percentages of their power from renewable sources other than hydroelectricity.\n\nThe reader was right to be wary about the president\u2019s numbers. While the U.S. decline in carbon emissions is large in absolute terms, on a relative basis, the United States is not in first place, especially compared to some major European countries. The U.S. falls even further behind if you use a 1990 starting point. The president should have just expressed the decline as a percentage \u2014 10 percent \u2014 without trying to score bragging points.", "lang": "en"}
