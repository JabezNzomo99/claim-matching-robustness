The rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump telling Zelensky: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General [William P. Barr] would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d (Note: The ellipsis appears in the White House document, suggesting something may have been removed before release.) As we have documented, Trump\u2019s claim that Biden stopped the prosecution of his son Hunter is false.\n\nYes, this happened repeatedly in the call: \u201cI will ask him [Giuliani] to call you along with the Attorney General,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it,\u201d he said at another point. Also: \u201cI will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.\u201d Trump also suggested that a presidential-level meeting \u2014 long sought by Zelensky \u2014 would happen only after Zelensky met first with Giuliani: \u201cWe are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nII. Efforts to restrict access to records related to the call\n\nThe whistleblower said that \u201cthe transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u201d The White House has confirmed this is true. He added that \u201cthis set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d CNN has reported that \u201cat least one National Security Council official alerted the White House\u2019s national security lawyers about the concerns,\u201d and then the White House\u2019s national security lawyers ordered the transcript to be moved \u201cto prevent more people from seeing it.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower said U.S. envoy Kurt Volker, the special representative for Ukraine negotiations, visited Kiev the day after the call and \u201cprovided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelenskyy.\u201d (Zelenskyy is a different transliteration of Zelensky.) The complaint also highlighted the role of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a Trump campaign contributor who ordinarily would not be expected to have a role in Ukraine policy matters. All of these elements have since been confirmed by Volker in his testimony before Congress and public records.\n\nIV. Circumstances leading up to the 25 July presidential phone call\n\nThe whistleblower wrote that he learned \u201con or about April 29\u201d that Yovanovitch had been recalled for \u201cconsultations\u201d and would likely be removed from her post. Yovanovitch testified to Congress that, after being asked to extend her tour to 2020, she was \"abruptly told in late April to come back to Washington from Ukraine \u2018on the next plane.\u2019\u201d She was told \u201cthe President had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador.\u201d\n\nTrue. The whistleblower reported that \u201cstarting in mid-May\u201d he heard from \u201cmultiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kyiv and the President.\u201d The Washington Post reported there was \u201ca months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists \u2014 including the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev.\u201d CNN disclosed that in a May 23 meeting Trump \u201cdirected Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and two top State Department officials to deal with his private attorney Rudy Giuliani when the Ukrainian President sought to meet Trump, in a clear circumvention of official channels.\u201d\n\nFor instance, in a text message ahead of the July 25 phone call, Volker told an adviser to Zelensky: \u201cHeard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow \u2014 kurt.\u201d And Andrey Yermak, an aide to Zelensky, wrote in an Aug. 10 message to Volker: \u201cOnce we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling investigations.\u201d (Burisma Holdings is the Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden had been a board member from 2014 to 2019.)\n\nThat has been confirmed by subsequent reporting, though in one instance a top diplomat privately thought there was a link between the aid and the requested Biden probe: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d wrote Bill Taylor, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires to Ukraine, in September to Sondland. Sondland replied there was no quid pro quo and the two should stop texting about it. Nevertheless, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has said that Sondland also told him that release of the aid was contingent upon Ukraine opening the requested investigations \u2014 but that Trump denied it when Johnson asked him if that was true.", "lang": "en"}
