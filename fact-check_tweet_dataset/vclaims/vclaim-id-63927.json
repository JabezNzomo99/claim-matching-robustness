Kamala Harris said, \u201cI don\u2019t like Joe Biden and do not like his history with certain people or who he\u2019s aligned with, he\u2019s trash to me.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Harris said the quote. It appears to have originated in a blog post about the June 2019 Democratic presidential primary debate.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden announced Harris as his pick for vice president Aug. 11, The New York Times reported. Since then, social media has become replete with misinformation about Harris. One viral post alleges Harris called Biden \u201ctrash\u201d in June 2019.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like Joe Biden and do not like his history with certain people or who he\u2019s aligned with, he\u2019s trash to me,\u201d Harris is credited with saying.

Rather, it appears to be the author\u2019s commentary. We rate this claim false.", "lang": "en"}
