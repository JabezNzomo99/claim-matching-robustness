Experts sharply disagree. Mexico does have penalties for immigration violations, but it decriminalized the act of crossing the border in 2011. Contrast that with the United States \u2014 where unauthorized entry is a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders \u2014 and Trump\u2019s claim falls apart.\n\nLet\u2019s compare deportation numbers from 2013 to 2018 in Mexico and the United States, looking only at people from the Northern Triangle countries. Mexico\u2019s total: 692,199. The U.S. total: 550,186. The Mexican figures are in calendar years, and the U.S. figures are in fiscal years. The point is that these are huge numbers for both countries.\n\nInterior Minister Olga S\u00e1nchez Cordero [of Mexico] announced recently that authorities would deploy security forces to form a containment belt across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico\u2019s narrowest point, about 200 miles north of the Guatemalan border. Mexico\u2019s most audacious step might be its agreement to become a sort of waiting room for migrants as they go through the process of seeking U.S. political asylum. That\u2019s part of a Trump administration program known as the Migration Protection Protocols. \u201cThis is a radical change in Mexican foreign policy,\u201d said Jorge Durand, an immigration expert at the University of Guadalajara.\n\n\u201cMexico did have an immigration law that made illegal entry into the country a crime, but that law was supplanted by a 2011 immigration law that makes it a civil infraction and tries to balance tough enforcement with the respect for the rights of migrants within Mexico,\u201d Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, wrote in an email. \u201cIn that sense, U.S. law, which now does deem illegal entry a crime, is a lot tougher than the current Mexican law.\u201d\n\nAs PolitiFact noted, the White House previously pointed to an article in the Washington Times to support Trump\u2019s claim that Mexico has the toughest immigration laws. The 2010 article discussed another Mexican law, which at the time required that \u201cfederal, local and municipal police cooperate with federal immigration authorities in that country in the arrests of illegal immigrants.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
