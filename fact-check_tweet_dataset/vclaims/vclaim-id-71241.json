I say kiddingly but I mean it. I don\u2019t care how sick you are. I don\u2019t care if you just came back from the doctor and he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it's over. You won\u2019t be around in two weeks. Doesn\u2019t matter. Hang out until November 8. Get out and vote. And then all we\u2019re going to say is we love you and we will remember you always.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The clip was filmed about a month before the Nov. 8, 2016, presidential election at a campaign rally in Henderson, Nevada.\n\nWe reached out to Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign for comment but did not hear back.\n\nThe clip is authentic but posts sharing it now leave the impression that Trump said this during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and is referring to people who have been diagnosed with the virus. That\u2019s False.", "lang": "en"}
