The Organization is not running a promo.\n\nAccording to a post on Facebook, the World Health Organization (WHO) is running an April Promo. The first 20,000 people to type the word \u201cWinner\u201d without being interrupted by another user will win brand new phones and laptops, according to the post.\n\nThis post has been shared widely, generating a total 427 shares across the social media platform.\n\nMany users are participating in the \u201cpromo\u201d with some going to the extent of leaving their telephone numbers in the comments section so the organizers can contact them if they win.\n\nMany alarms go off immediately anyone looks at the page in question. Firstly, the Facebook page was created just yesterday, April 26. It is also not linked to the official Facebook page of the World Health Organisations (WHO) which was created on November 18, 2010.\n\nSecondly, whereas the official page is verified, this suspicious Facebook page is not. Furthermore, although the page name reads as World Health Organisation, the acronym is written differently from the original. Whereas the original page writes WHO, this Facebook page writes W.H.O-NOW.\n\nAdditionally, further checks from the WHO.int page has no indication of any such promo being run.\n\nAgain, no reports have been published on the existence or authenticity of such a promotion being run on any major news platform. Considering the fact that WHO is an international organisation, it is highly unlikely that it would carry out such a \u201cpromo\u201d without it being covered by media agencies across the world.\n\nThe WHO is not running a promo through which participants can win brand new phones and laptops. This claim is false and highly indicative of a scam.", "lang": "en"}
