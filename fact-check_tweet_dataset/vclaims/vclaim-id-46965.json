Qatar beat Iraq 1-0 in the quarterfinals of 2019 AFC Asian Cup in January 2019.\n\nWe also found an article by Fox Sports Asia that identified the photographer as Mohammed Al Assasawi.\n\nWe compared photos of Al-Assawi with the viral photo and found that both matched.\n\nWe also found an interview which Al-Assawi gave to RT Arabic on his photo going viral.
