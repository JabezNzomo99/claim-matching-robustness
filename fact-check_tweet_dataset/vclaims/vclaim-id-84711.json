The claim is false; the photo in fact shows people praying in Dubai.\n\nThe photo was shared nearly 700 times since being published on Facebook here on April 14, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi caption translates to English as: \u201cThis act of praying might be loyalty to their religion but this is mutiny against India #coronavirus, #covid19 #stayathome.\u201d\n\nThe post was published the same day that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an extension to India\u2019s nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, which has been in place in the country of 1.3 billion people since March 25, AFP reported.\n\nThe photo was also shared alongside a similar claim here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nA combination of reverse image and keyword searches based on identified landmarks in the photo found that it was in fact taken in Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nDubai imposed a 24-hour lockdown on April 4 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported by AFP.\n\nThe photo was published in an Arabic report on a Tunisian media news website here. Subsequent searches with Arabic keywords found that the photo was also published on Twitter here on April 12, 2020.\n\nThe tweet translates to English as: \u201cThis is your dad\u2019s curse, oh Ekab. This picture applies to an old story.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe twitter user, Maher Al Bawardi, told AFP the photo was taken in Dubai.\n\n\u201cThis photo is from Dubai and the caption is an old Arabic proverb used when someone regrets seeing a thing or feels bad about seeing a thing,\u201d Al Bawardi, who is a freelance journalist based in Saudi Arabia, said via direct message on Twitter.\n\nThree visible landmarks in the background of the photo also confirm that the prayer took place in Dubai.\n\nThe landmarks are circled in red and marked A, B and C in the screenshot below:\n\nThe building marked A is a multi-level car park located in Dubai\u2019s Al Ras neighbourhood. It can be seen here Google Maps and from different angles here and here on Instant Street View, a separate Google Maps display platform.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the street view images:\n\nAFP also published footage of the same building in this video on March 31, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the AFP video (L) and an Instant Street View image (R) taken from a similar location where AFP captured the video:\n\nThe waterway marked B is the Dubai Creek, a saltwater canal that extends into the Persian Gulf and passes alongside the buildings seen in the photo shared in the misleading posts. The specific part of the creek can be seen on Instant Street View here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the creek beside the multi-level car park (Landmark A):\n\n\n\nThe minaret and dome seen in the photo correspond to a mosque located across the Dubai Creek. The mosque can be seen on Google Maps here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the mosque\u2019s minaret from the side of the creek that the shared photo was taken from:\n\nLandmarks A, B and C are also visible in Google Earth satellite images.
