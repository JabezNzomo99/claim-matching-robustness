Son kept sobbing..this is horrifying!! World has turned a blind eye to what is happening in India. #extremism #saveminorities.\"\n\nBOOM has chosen not to include the video due to its graphic nature.\n\nThe video was viewed more than 98,000 times at the time of writing this article. The account had peddled misinformation earlier as well.\n\nThe same video has been tweeted by multiple Pakistani handles with a similar narrative.\n\nThe incident happened in August this year, when a middle aged couple - Jogendra Singh, 40, and his wife Chandrawati - doused themselves with kerosene after arriving at the Surir police station of Mathura district. They set themselves afire as the police failed to take any action against a local goon and their neighbour Satyapal Singh for allegedly harassing them.\n\nBOOM reached out to the Surir police station who rule out any communal angle to the incident. The Surir police informed that the couple were Rajputs and upset over muscleman Satyapal Singh's repeated harassment.\n\nBystanders stood shell shocked as the son sobbed and shot the couple burning. An excerpt from the Times Of India report reads, \u201cA 55-second video, purportedly shot by their 14-year-old son, who can be heard crying in the background, has been shared widely on the social media. The video shows that the man and woman set themselves on fire and a cop and another man rushing to douse the flames with a table cloth and a blanket.\"\n\nTimes of India quoted the couple's son alleging that Satyapal Singh used to publicly humiliate the couple and had molested the woman. However, police did not register an FIR against the accused when the family sought help.\n\nFollowing the incident the main accused was arrested and three policemen were suspended for failing to take timely action against the accused, according to TOI.", "lang": "en"}
