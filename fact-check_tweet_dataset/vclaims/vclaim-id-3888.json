It is from Politico and stated that he said this during an interview with Fox news on Sunday (no specific Sunday posted).\n\nDonald Trump lamented the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges decision during a Fox News appearance and suggested that strategic Supreme Court appointments could overturn that ruling, and his running mate Mike Pence agreed that the legality of same-sex marriage is an issue that should have been left to the states.\n\nOn 31 January 2016, a number of social media users shared links to articles reporting that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had sworn to overturn the legality of same-sex marriage if elected President, with a New York magazine item of that date reporting:\n\nDonald Trump indeed appeared on Fox News Sunday with interviewer Chris Wallace on 31 January 2016 and briefly discussed the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 5-4 Obergefell v. Hodges decision in 2015. A record of that discussion is available via a transcript provided by Fox:\n\nWALLACE: But, Mr. Trump, let\u2019s take one issue. You say now that the Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriage is the law of the land and that any politician who talks about wanting to amend the Constitution is just playing politics. Are you saying it\u2019s time to move on? TRUMP: No, I\u2019m saying this. It has been ruled up. It has been there. If I\u2019m a, you know, if I\u2019m elected, I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things. But they\u2019ve got a long way to go. I mean at some point, we have to get back down to business. But there\u2019s no question about it. I mean most \u2014 and most people feel this way. They have ruled on it. I wish that it was done by the state. I don\u2019t like the way they ruled. I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state \u2014 it should be a states\u2019 rights issue. And that\u2019s the way it should have been ruled on, Chris, not the way they did it. This is a very surprising ruling. And I \u2014 I can see changes coming down the line, frankly. But I would have much preferred that they ruled at a state level and allowed the states to make those rulings themselves. WALLACE: But \u2014 but just to button this up very quickly, sir, are you saying that if you become president, you might try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage? TRUMP: I would strongly consider that, yes.\n\nInterviewer Chris Wallace initially questioned Trump about a statement made by the latter suggesting that he was disinterested in any sort of Republican party line opposing same-sex marriage because the issue had already been definitively decided by the Supreme Court. In response, Trump said the opposite: that he felt the matter of same-sex marriage should have been left to individual states to decide, and that he would \u201cbe very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things.\u201d\n\nWhen Wallace questioned if Trump truly meant that he \u201cmight try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage,\u201d the candidate responded by affirming that he \u201cwould strongly consider that.\u201d\n\nTrump was clearly courting a political base with his answer about reversing the legality of same-sex marriage, but when asked if he planned to pursue such a course of action, Trump said only that he\u2019d \u201cconsider it\u201d (which is Trump\u2019s stock answer to a plethora of policy issues: a non-committal assurance that he will \u201clook into\u201d or \u201cconsider\u201d a potential course of action).\n\nThe likelihood of a Trump administration taking whatever action it can to reverse marriage equality increased after the GOP nominee named Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a social conservative with a long history of taking anti-LGBT stands, as his running mate. Pence\u2019s 2000 Congressional campaign web site listed the following position statements under the heading \u201cStrengthening the American Family\u201d:\n\nIn June 2015, The Journal Gazette reported that Pence had made a statement echoing Donald Trump\u2019s position that same-sex marriage is properly a \u201cstate\u2019s rights issue\u201d:\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence issued a statement saying he is disappointed in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling giving same-sex couples the right to marry in any state. Pence said Friday he believes marriage is the union between one man and one woman and that he was disappointed the Supreme Court failed to recognize the historic role of the states in setting marriage policy. But he says his administration will uphold the law and abide by the court ruling.\n\nIn September 2016, Donald Trump vowed to sign the so-called \u201cFirst Amendment Defense Act\u201d (FADA), if passed by Congress, a bill that aims to prevent the federal government from enforcing marriage equality by taking punitive action against individuals, corporations, or organizations who discriminate against same-sex married couples. Critics say the bill would effectively legalize such discrimination.\n\nTrump was elected President of the United States on 8 November 2016. Neither he nor Pence had significantly modified their stances on same-sex marriage between the primaries and the general election. While the president does not have the Constitutional power to overturn a Supreme Court decision, he does have the ability to appoint justices who would. Based on past statements of both the president- and vice president-elect, it seems likely that this will come to pass should any vacancies in the Supreme Court occur.", "lang": "en"}
