Health experts told AFP there is no evidence to support these claims and say washing your hands regularly is the best way to stay healthy.\n\n\u201cPlease do this as a preventive measures (sic) in respect of CORONAVIRUS\u201d, reads a post on a Nigerian Facebook page shared more than 4,000 times since March 31, 2020.\n\n\u201cWhat I am going to tell you is extremely important, which has shared to be (sic) by my Chinese business partner who lives in City near Wuhan,\u201d explains a similar post from an account in the Philippines.\n\nThe posts recommend several ways to \u201ccontrol\u201d COVID-19, the disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.\n\nThe posts recommend drinking \u201chot liquids\u201d such as tea and coffee. \u201cDrink as much hot water as possible,\u201d they say. \u201cThis will take the thick mucus into our stomach where \u2026 gastric juices will destroy it.\u201d\n\nWhile health experts recommend staying hydrated, there is no evidence that drinking hot or cold water can prevent COVID-19.\n\nContacted by AFP, Brandon Brown, a professor at the University of California Riverside\u2019s Center for Healthy Communities, said there was \u201cno need to change the temperature of your drinking water\u201d.\n\n\u201cDrinking water is always important, not just for coronavirus prevention,\u201d he told AFP by email.\n\nSimilarly, Jayaruwan Bandara, director of the Sri Lanka Medical Research Institute, said there was no proof that drinking tea could ward off the virus. \u201cWhile drinking tea can be beneficial for one\u2019s health, it cannot be touted as a preventive measure or a treatment in the case of COVID-19,\u201d he told AFP by phone.\n\nHe said the \u201conly way\u201d to minimise the risk of infection was to follow official advice, including washing of hands and social distancing.\n\nThe posts also advise gargling \u201csalt, turmeric, or any oral antiseptic\u201d to prevent COVID-19. While gargling salt water is a common treatment for a sore throat, there is no proof that it can prevent infection from coronavirus.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s website, some traditional or home remedies can \u201calleviate symptoms\u201d of COVID-19, although \u201cthere is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease\u201d.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s recommendations, as well as those of health authorities in the United States, Canada, the UK and Australia, do not list gargling as a way to prevent COVID-19.\n\nAFP previously debunked similar claims that gargling salt water and vinegar could prevent the virus.\n\nThe posts recommend boosting vitamin C consumption, for example eating citrus fruits, to \u201cstrengthen your immunity\u201d. Although vitamin C has many health benefits, there is no evidence it can prevent COVID-19.\n\nHenry Chenal, director of the Integrated Bioclinical Research Centre (CIRBA) in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, told AFP that consuming a high amount of vitamin C \u201chas never proved effective against coronavirus\u201d.\n\nAFP has debunked similar claims that drinking water with lemon could prevent the disease.\n\n\u201cIf you touch any metallic substance the virus stays active on it for 9 hours,\u201d the posts claim. They advise using an alcohol-based product to disinfect such surfaces.\n\nThe World Health Organization's website says that the virus seems to behave like other coronaviruses, which survive on surfaces \"for a few hours or up to several days\", depending on factors such as the type of surface.\n\nAFP reported on a US study that suggested that the new coronavirus was detectable for up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, and for up to 24 hours on cardboard.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s website recommends cleaning dirty surfaces with soap and water or another detergent, then using a household disinfectant.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take any thing cold, is not good for your system in preventive measure against CORONAVIRUS (sic),\u201d the posts say. They advise against consuming cold food and drink, such as ice cream.\n\nAFP previously debunked claims that the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s fund UNICEF advised the public to avoid cold foods. The organisation rejected the rumours in a statement.\n\n\u201cA recent erroneous online message circulating in several languages around the world and purporting to be a UNICEF communication appears to indicate, among other things, that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease,\u201d it said. \u201cThis is, of course, wholly untrue.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 spreads when droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person land on another person or on a surface. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face and keeping a distance from people who are sick.\n\nThere is currently no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19, which has claimed more than 46,000 lives as of April 2, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
