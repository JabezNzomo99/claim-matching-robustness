A 2019 report from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 inspector general also said that \u201chistorically\u201d such family \u201cseparations were rare and occurred because of circumstances such as a parent\u2019s medical emergency or a determination that the parent was a threat to the child\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Committee to Defend the President, a pro-Trump hybrid group that can operate as a super PAC and a traditional political action committee, reported spending $225,000 to run the ad attacking Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate, in Nevada starting on Feb. 19, just three days before the state\u2019s Democratic caucuses. As of Feb. 21, it had aired at least 70 times combined in Las Vegas and Reno, according to Advertising Analytics.\n\n\n\nThe Census Bureau estimates that about 30% of Nevadans are Hispanic or Latino.\n\nAs a female narrator speaks in Spanish, viewers see a translation that reads: \u201cBarack Obama & Joe Biden promised to reform immigration. We didn\u2019t know, it was a lie. They separated families and put children in cages. Barack Obama & Joe Biden failed. Now, Joe Biden is promising to reform immigration\u2026 is he lying again?\u201d\n\nAt the same time, black and white images on screen show young people, some with foil blankets, sleeping on thin mats inside of chain link enclosures. However, the images are not of children whom Obama-era border officials separated from their families, as the ad could lead voters to believe. Instead, the Associated Press images \u2014 which were originally in color \u2014 show some of the tens of thousands of mostly Central American minors who were apprehended while crossing into the U.S. from Mexico without any parent in 2014.\n\nThe unaccompanied children were taken to a \u201cmakeshift border-town processing center\u201d in Nogales, Arizona, according to a June 2014 story in the Arizona Republic that included the photos of them \u201cbehind 18-foot-high chain-link fences topped with razor wire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nogales facility is a way station where the children are identified, examined for health problems by the U.S. Public Health Service, vaccinated and then moved to other facilities in Texas, Oklahoma and California until they are placed with relatives already in the country to await their day in Immigration Court,\u201d the article explained.\n\nJeh Johnson, who was the secretary of the Department Homeland Security at the time, said in June 2019 that such facilities were erected quickly because the administration needed a place to temporarily hold the children who were coming in such large numbers. And \u201cthey put those chain link partitions up,\u201d he said, \u201cso you could segregate young women from young men, kids from adults, until they were either released or transferred to HHS,\u201d or the Department of Health and Human Services, as required by law.\n\nWhile the narrator of the anti-Biden commercial says that Obama and Biden \u201cseparated families and put children in cages,\u201d a citation at the top of the screen reads, \u201cSource: AP News 5/30/18.\u201d An AP fact-check published that day said that critics of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy that resulted in family separations at the border had wrongly circulated the photos taken at the Arizona border facility in 2014, under Obama, as if they were from 2018, under Trump.\n\nBut even that fact-check noted that an AP caption on the photos \u201crefers to U.S. efforts to process 47,000 unaccompanied children at the Nogales center and another one in Brownsville, Texas.\u201d\n\nImmigration experts previously told us that family separations did occur under Obama, but not at the same scale as they did under Trump. One of those experts was Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nIn an explainer piece for the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s website in June 2018, Brown and her co-author, Tim O\u2019Shea, wrote that prior to Trump: \u201cSome children may have been separated from the adults they entered with, in cases where the family relationship could not be established, child trafficking was suspected, or there were not sufficient family detention facilities available. \u2026 However, the zero-tolerance policy is the first time that a policy resulting in separation is being applied across the board.\u201d\n\nThat was later confirmed by the HHS inspector general\u2019s January 2019 report, which found that such separations were \u201crare\u201d and had largely occurred if the parent had a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d or was deemed a \u201cthreat to the child\u2019s safety.\u201d That changed under Trump\u2019s Department of Homeland Security, which \u201cseparated large numbers of alien families, with adults being held in Federal detention while their children were transferred to the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),\u201d the report said.\n\nBut the anti-Biden ad by the pro-Trump group mentions none of that, and instead misleadingly uses images of unaccompanied minors to illustrate a claim about Biden separating families.\n\nThe Trump administration has identified more than 4,300 children it says were affected by its policies, according to a Jan. 13 court filing in a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. DHS couldn\u2019t provide us with any statistics on how many children may have been separated from their parents under the Obama administration.\n\nThe HHS inspector general said that the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency that assumes responsibility for the children once they are separated from their parents, had only \u201cbegun informally tracking separations in 2016.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
