Saxby Chambliss\u2019 seat is more crowded than the mall on Christmas Eve.\n\nThus far, the race includes three congressmen, a former secretary of state, a former state senator, a former U.S. senator\u2019s daughter and a former governor\u2019s cousin. And that\u2019s just the candidates who\u2019ve grabbed the most headlines. For lesser-known candidates, distinguishing themselves has been tough.\n\nOne candidate, Dr. Branko Radulovacki, a Democrat and Atlanta psychiatrist, is doing his best to emerge from the fray. -- as he prefers to be called -- has been appearing everywhere, commenting on the issues in online videos, town hall meetings and through campaign emails.\n\nOne such email, titled \"Walking the Talk,\" highlights Dr. Rad\u2019s actions. The email includes several \"only\" statements, touting the Atlanta doctor as being the only candidate to participate in the 50th anniversary March on Washington, the \"Si se puede\" immigration reform march in Atlanta and to march in Atlanta\u2019s Pride parade.\n\nBut it was his \"only\" statements about two controversial political topics -- Syria and the Affordable Care Act -- that intrigued us.\n\nHere are the key statements from Dr. Rad\u2019s campaign email, emphasis his:\n\n\"I\u2019m the one who spoke out against bombing Syria. And the one who took on Governor Deal and Insurance Commissioner Hudgens over their efforts to .\"\n\nWith more than a dozen announced candidates in that U.S. Senate race, we were curious whether Dr. Rad\u2019s statements were correct. Did he actually hold the \"only\" title on these two issues? We decided to investigate.\n\nA few months ago, international relations were strained as President Barack Obama considered taking military action against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons. Dr. Rad released a opposing the strikes. And at the time, many of Georgia\u2019s leading Republicans, including those running for Senate, also denounced Obama\u2019s plans, saying the president failed to make his case for attacking the country.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia\u2019s research found that Peach State congressmen and Senate candidates and spoke out against the proposed attacks, and U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston was . And former Secretary of State Karen Handel even made a out of her opposition, and used it as an attack ad against leading Democratic challenger Michelle Nunn.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former state Sen. Steen Miles also strikes on Syria. From our research of major announced candidates, only Nunn Obama\u2019s plans.\n\nThere was less political chatter surrounding Dr. Rad\u2019s Affordable Care Act claim. Georgia Gov. Nathan and Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens were early opponents of Obama\u2019s health care plan. Hudgens even bragged during the summer about being an \" \" to the law. Last week, when asked about the health care plan rollout, Hudgens said he hopes the plan \" .\"\n\nGeorgia chose Medicaid for low-income residents, and not to offer a state-based health care marketplace for its residents seeking health insurance coverage under the new law.\n\nDr. Rad released a about the leaders\u2019 \"obstructionism,\" saying it was hurting the state. \"We call on Gov. Deal and Insurance Commissioner Hudgens to STEP UP and lead, or STEP ASIDE,\" Rad\u2019s statement and petition said. Last week, he Hudgens for putting some helpful information about the law and insurance marketplaces on the insurance commissioner\u2019s .\n\nAlong with Dr. Rad\u2019s statements, we found from Nunn about Deal\u2019s rejection of the Medicaid expansion and the impact on war veterans. (Nunn received a rating from PolitiFact Georgia for her statements.)\n\nWhen contacted by PolitiFact Georgia, Dr. Rad reviewed the statements and admitted that his campaign email was incorrect. The doctor said that a campaign staffer in charge of composing the email unintentionally misrepresented one of Dr. Rad\u2019s posts. That post, an open letter dated Oct. 11, detailed the ways the physician was different from the other Senate candidates.\n\n\"The buck stops with me,\" Dr. Rad told us. \"It was a mistake and I take full responsibility for that mistake. I will set the record straight.\"\n\nDr. Rad promised to send out another campaign statement correcting the errors.\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nThe Atlanta physician released a campaign email that said he was the only Senate candidate to speak out against bombing Syria, and to challenge Georgia\u2019s governor and insurance commissioner about obstructing the federal health care law.\n\nDr. Rad is incorrect on the first point: Several Republican candidates, including current congressmen, spoke against proposed attacks on Syria. And another candidate produced a radio ad about her opposition.\n\nOn the health care front, one other Democratic Senate candidate spoke out against the state\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid to poor residents, which was a large part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDr. Rad admitted that the campaign email was incorrect and promised to correct the error.\n\nBut on the initial claim, the doctor gets a False.", "lang": "en"}
