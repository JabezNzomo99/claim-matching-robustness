Y\u2019know, if you show up with prostate cancer, you\u2019re 95 years old, we should say, \u2018Go and enjoy. Have a nice [inaudible]. Live a long life. There\u2019s no cure, and we can\u2019t do anything.\u2019 If you\u2019re a young person, we should do something about it,\u201d Bloomberg said in the video.\n\nThe same article was later republished by the National Interest magazine, and on Feb. 17 the right-leaning Red State blog published an article with a headline that stated \u201cBloomberg Suggests Denying Care to Elderly Patient With Cancer Because Not Cost Effective in 2011 Video.\u201d\n\nAll three articles contained a 40-second video clip of Bloomberg sitting with a group of men, making the following remarks:\n\n[\u2026] And what things they can\u2019t fix right away. If you\u2019re bleeding, they\u2019ll stop the bleeding, if you need an X-Ray, you\u2019re going to have to wait. All of these costs keep going up, nobody wants to pay any more money, and at the rate we\u2019re going, health care is going to bankrupt us. So not only do we have a problem, it\u2019s going to bankrupt us, and we\u2019ve got to sit here and say which things we\u2019re going to do and which things we\u2019re not. Nobody wants to do that. If you show up with prostate cancer and you\u2019re 95 years old, we should say \u2018Go and enjoy, have a nice [inaudible], lead a long life.\u2019 There\u2019s no cure and you can\u2019t do anything. If you\u2019re a young person, we should do something about it. Society\u2019s not willing to do that yet. So we\u2019re going to bankrupt us, and we\u2019re not looking at [\u2026]\n\nBloomberg undoubtedly made the remarks shown in that video. Although the 40-second clip was cut from longer footage, it was not doctored or further edited. Likewise, the video did not present the remarks in their full and proper context, but that did not serve to substantially alter or misrepresent the sense or meaning of what Bloomberg said. He did indeed propose that, in light of rising health care costs and hospital overcrowding in New York, health care providers should not attempt to treat elderly patients with terminal cancer, instead prioritizing younger patients with better prospects of recovery.\n\nThe conversation shown in the video took place in February 2011. Bloomberg was \u201csitting shiva\u201d (a Jewish mourning ritual) with the family of Rabbi Moshe Segal, a Brooklyn man who, according to his family, spent 73 hours in a New York emergency room before his death. Shimon Gifter, a Brooklyn photographer, recorded more than nine minutes of Bloomberg\u2019s visit and posted it to his YouTube channel.\n\nThe full conversation can be viewed below. In the interest of providing as much context as possible, the following is an unedited transcript of the section of the discussion during which Bloomberg made his comments about treating elderly prostate cancer patients. The first few seconds shows Bloomberg entering the room, greeting and shaking hands with Segal\u2019s family members, some of whom thank him for his visit. Bloomberg, who was mayor of New York City at that time, sits and observes that the deceased was \u201cyoung.\u201d A brother of Segal replies \u201cVery young,\u201d then quickly segues into a conversation about health care:\n\nSegal\u2019s brother: \u2026I apologize for bringing up conditions in New York City during this [visit], but in light of my brother\u2019s death, I must tell you that we have, I know you know this, but from personal experience the overcrowding in the emergency rooms is insane. He was there for 73 hours [inaudible] \u2014 Bloomberg: It\u2019s going to get worse with the health care bill [the Affordable Care Act] and with the governor\u2019s cutbacks, because the governor\u2019s cutbacks \u2014 which, he may not have any choice in all fairness to the governor \u2014 but there\u2019d be less money, some of these small hospitals will close, some of these other programs, and people will come to the HHC [New York Health and Hospitals Corporation] hospitals, and that\u2019s \u2014 Segal\u2019s brother: \u2014 They\u2019ll be there for days, [inaudible]. Bloomberg: Well, they try to decide what things they can fix right away and what things they can\u2019t fix right away. If you\u2019re bleeding, they\u2019ll stop the bleeding, if you need an X-Ray, you\u2019re going to have to wait. That\u2019s just \u2014 all of these costs keep going up, nobody wants to pay any more money, and at the rate we\u2019re going, health care is going to bankrupt us. So not only do we have a problem, it\u2019s going to bankrupt us, and we\u2019ve got to sit here and say which things we\u2019re going to do and which things we\u2019re not. Nobody wants to do that. If you show up with prostate cancer and you\u2019re 95 years old, we should say, \u2018Go and enjoy, have a nice [inaudible], lead a long life.\u2019 There\u2019s no cure and you can\u2019t do anything. If you\u2019re a young person, we should do something about it. Society\u2019s not willing to do that yet. So we\u2019re going to bankrupt us, and we\u2019re not looking at prophylactic care. We\u2019re not trying to take care of things so we don\u2019t get sick. Nobody ever says thank you for keeping you from getting sick, they say thank you if you\u2019re sick and we cure you [\u2026].\n\nWe invited Bloomberg\u2019s presidential campaign to provide any context, background or additional information that might impinge upon a viewer\u2019s understanding of his remarks. We also asked the campaign whether Bloomberg stood by what he said. We did not receive a response of any kind in time for publication.", "lang": "en"}
