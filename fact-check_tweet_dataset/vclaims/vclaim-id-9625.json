That\u2019s generally how other countries fare before the WTO as well.\n\nThose facts run contrary to the narrative President Donald Trump put forth in a Fox Business Network interview on Oct. 25.\n\nIn his interview with Fox Business\u2019 Lou Dobbs, Trump wrongly claimed that \u201cwe lose the lawsuits, almost all of the lawsuits \u2026 within the WTO.\u201d And that\u2019s because, Trump said, \u201cwe have fewer judges than other countries.\u201d\n\nTrump, Oct. 25: The WTO, World Trade Organization, was set up for the benefit for everybody but us. They have taken advantage of this country like you wouldn\u2019t believe. And I say to my people, you tell them, like as an example, we lose the lawsuits, almost all of the lawsuits in the WTO \u2014 within the WTO. Because we have fewer judges than other countries. It\u2019s set up as you can\u2019t win. In other words, the panels are set up so that we don\u2019t have majorities. It was set up for the benefit of taking advantage of the United States.\n\nThe World Trade Organization is an arrangement between 164 countries worldwide and \u201cserves as a forum for negotiations on trading rules as well as a mechanism for dispute settlements in trade issues,\u201d according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nSince the WTO began regulating international trade in 1995, the country bringing a complaint to the WTO has won about 90 percent of the time. That\u2019s among the adjudicated cases \u2014 most cases are settled between the countries before that.\n\nSimon Lester, a trade policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, explained that the reason for the high success rate by complaining countries is that \u201cgovernments don\u2019t bring WTO complaints unless they are pretty sure they will win.\u201d\n\nThat has proven true for cases brought by and against the U.S.\n\nIn March, Dan Ikenson, director of Cato\u2019s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, reviewed WTO trade disputes involving the U.S. from 1995 to March of this year. He found that the U.S. prevailed in 91 percent of cases that it brought against other countries.\n\n\u201cWhen the United States has been a complainant (as it has in 114 of 522 WTO disputes over 22 years \u2014 more than any other WTO member) it has prevailed on 91 percent of adjudicated issues,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen the United States is a respondent (as it has been in 129 cases \u2014 more than any other WTO member), it has lost on 89 percent of adjudicated issues.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s in line with the won-lost percentage for other countries as well, experts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know where to start,\u201d Malawer told us. \u201cPresident Trump is absolutely wrong. Period. Not only does the U.S. not lose almost all of its lawsuits, it in fact wins most of them as a complaining state.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Malawer published research that found the U.S. won 38 cases as a complainant and lost four between 1995 and 2012. But as a respondent \u2014 in other words in cases filed by another country against the U.S. \u2014 the U.S. won 17 cases and lost 50, he found.\n\nMost disputes filed with the WTO \u2014 about two-thirds \u2014 were settled between the countries before they got to litigation by a WTO panel, Malawer noted.\n\nRufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council and deputy director general of the WTO from 2002 to 2013, told us via email that Trump\u2019s assertion is simply incorrect.\n\n\u201cU.S. is the most frequent complainant in WTO dispute settlement and has won over 90 percent of the cases it has brought,\u201d Yerxa said. \u201cIt has lost many cases as a defendant. So have most other countries, since most countries only bring cases they know they can win. But most of the \u2026 losses were a result of the U.S. refusing to change its anti-dumping methodology even after it lost cases, thereby incurring repeated rulings against them for continuing the same practice. If you take those cases out, the US has a better record as a defendant than China or most others!\u201d\n\nThe U.S. was essentially undefeated during the Obama years in cases the U.S. litigated through the WTO.\n\n\u201cUnder the Obama administration, we brought 26 cases to the WTO, 16 of them against China, and we won every single one of the cases that was brought to a conclusion,\u201d Michael Froman, who served as the U.S. trade representative from June 2013 to January 2017, told us in a phone interview.\n\nEven the president\u2019s \u201c2017 Trade Policy Agenda\u201d released in March notes (on page 170) that the United States \u201chad some enforcement successes in 2016.\u201d Those successes include a case against Indonesia\u2019s \u201cimport barriers against U.S. agricultural products\u201d and a dispute with the European Union over civil aircraft.\n\nWTO experts we interviewed were also scratching their heads over Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S. loses most of its lawsuits \u2014 again it doesn\u2019t \u2014 \u201cbecause we have fewer judges than other countries\u201d and that \u201c[i]t\u2019s set up as you can\u2019t win. In other words, the panels are set up so that we don\u2019t have majorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Malawer said.\n\nHere\u2019s how the dispute settlement system works: Initially, countries attempt to settle disputes through a voluntary \u201cconciliation and mediation\u201d process (see Article 5 of the WTO\u2019s rules and procedures for settlement of disputes). Most of the time, disputes are settled before litigation. Unresolved disputes are brought to a three-person panel, which is drawn from a WTO-approved list of qualified individuals (see Article 8). None of the panelists can be from a country involved in the dispute.\n\nThe panel\u2019s decisions can be appealed. An appellate board of three members is chosen on a rotating basis from seven standing full-time members of the appellate body (see Article 17). Appellate board members serve four-year terms, and the U.S. has one member on the appellate board.\n\nIt\u2019s true, as Trump says, that the \u201cpanels are set up so that we don\u2019t have majorities.\u201d But neither does the opposing country. In fact, none of the panelists come from countries involved in a dispute. That\u2019s not evidence, as Trump says, that the dispute resolution system is \u201cset up for the benefit of taking advantage of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe WTO\u2019s Dispute Resolution System is the most effective international mechanism in settling disputes in the international system today,\u201d Malawer told us. \u201cAnd the U.S. was the primary architect of it. It persuaded the global trading system to adopt a judicial/litigation approach to settle trade disputes in 1995.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to the White House press office for support or clarification of the president\u2019s comments, but we did not hear back.\n\nThe Trump administration takes issue with some of the decisions reached by WTO panels against the U.S., and we take no position on that. But, despite Trump\u2019s claim, the U.S. wins most of the cases it brings to the WTO, and it loses most of those brought against it \u2014 just like other countries.\n\nThe fact that the U.S. does not enjoy a majority of judges on either WTO panels or appellate boards is not evidence that the deck is stacked against the U.S. Those are the same rules other countries are playing by as well.", "lang": "en"}
