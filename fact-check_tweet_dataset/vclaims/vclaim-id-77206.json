The vast majority of premium increases, experts said, was due to continually rising health care costs. And, notably, the trend the in increases has markedly slowed.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act did require that employers provide preventative care services without cost sharing,\" Blumberg said, \"and there were some other small changes, but those changes, the actuaries estimated that at most that would have an impact of 1 or 2 percent on premiums (in job-based coverage).\"\n\nIn addition to requiring employers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer health insurance, the health care law mandated several more changes, most of which came into effect in 2014. (The rule requiring that employers with 50-99 full-time employees offer coverage did not come into effect until Jan. 1, 2016.) Some other notable changes included: > The requirement that dependents under 26 could be covered. > Mandatory minimum coverage, which includes things like preventive services, among other things. > Ban on cost-sharing limits such as copays and deductibles. > Ban on refusing coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions. Such changes made it impossible for employers to offer bare minimum coverage without facing penalties.\n\nAccording to a Kaiser news release included with the interactive graph that Hartzler\u2019s team cited, since 2011, when the Affordable Care Act was first implemented, the average of family premiums in job-based coverage has only increased 20 percent. Between 2006 and 2011 the increase in premium cost in the same coverage was 31 percent. And between 2001 and 2006 it was 63 percent, according to the full report and corresponding data.\n\nHartzler claimed that \"Obamacare has caused high premiums and dismal coverage,\" and that \"premiums in job-based coverage have increased by $3,775.\" Her claim ignores a key finding of the study from which her numbers came: that the increase in premiums is dramatically slowing. She also discounted the fact that experts believe that only 1 to 3 percent of the increase in premium cost was actually attributable to the Affordable Care Act.", "lang": "en"}
