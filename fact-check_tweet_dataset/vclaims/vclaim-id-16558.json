Whether this myth arose as a need to deter people from designing their bodies, we do not know; however, we know that a lot of people believe it.\n\nTo start with, tattoo can be a form of body modification where a design is made by inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to create a pattern. By this definition, tribal marks or religious markings can be considered \u201ctattoo\u201d as well. And it has been practiced for many centuries in a number of countries including Japan, China, New Zealand, and Nigeria.\n\nThe art of blood donation is seen as a noble thing \u2013 voluntarily giving one\u2019s blood to save another. Usually, it causes no harm to the donor, and on each donating occasion, prospective donors are usually examined for suitability and capacity to donate blood.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) Guide on assessing Donor suitability4blood Donation, the purpose of blood donor selection are:\n\u2022 Protect donor health and safety by collecting blood only from healthy individuals\n\u2022 Ensure patient safety by collecting blood only from donors whose donations, when transfused, will be safe for the recipients\n\u2022 Identify any factors that might make an individual unsuitable as a donor, either temporarily or permanently\n\u2022 Reduce the unnecessary deferral of safe and healthy donors\n\u2022 Ensure the quality of blood products derived from whole blood and apheresis donation\n\u2022 Minimise the wastage of resources resulting from the collection of unsuitable donations.\n\nIt is then after this process that a donor is declared fit to donate.\n\nTATTOOED INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ENTIRELY EXCLUDED FROM BLOOD DONATION\n\nIf it is a new tattoo, the prospective donor will be deferred for a certain period to discover if at all he or she is infected in any way and not fit to donate. But for an old tattooed donor, certain process/test will be carried out to determine the suitability of the prospective donor just like a regular person.\n\nIn medicine, a contraindication is a condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical ministration due to the harm that it can cause.\n\nIn a conversation with a medical doctor, Tavershima Adongo, he says that it is not totally prohibited, but there are usually restrictions for a period of 6 months to 1 year for a tattooed donor. Dr. Tavershima says that \u2018\u2018most viral infections have an incubation period, and within this period, any infection contacted by the tattooed donor is taking time to establish itself within the body after which it would show signs.\u201c\n\n\u201cMost tests cannot detect infection at their incubation period\u201c, he says, \u201cinfections like HIV, Hepatitis B, etc and that is why they will not be allowed to donate at that time until when they are fully cleared\u201c.\n\nTo further corroborate this statement, the WHO Guide states that:\n\n\u2018\u2018Individuals who present a history of any procedures involving penetration of the skin should be assessed for the risk of TTI (Transfusion-transmissible infection), based on when, where, by whom and how the procedure was performed. The BTS should define the deferral period, based on the sterility and safety of the procedure. If it is not possible to ascertain the sterility and safety of the procedure, the individual should be deferred for a period of 12 months\u2019\u2019.\n\nCONCLUSION: Anyone can donate BUT the prospective donor will just have to go through a process called \u2018\u2018DONOR SELECTION\u2019\u2019 which will confirm the suitability and capability of such an individual!", "lang": "en"}
