The Democrats\u2019 $6,000 figure is outdated and discredited (note the small type in the ad with citations from 2011). It\u2019s worthy of Four Pinocchios. The Republicans\u2019 $700 billion is a stretch, but at least it\u2019s based on real numbers \u2014 and The Washington Post has reported that the reductions in spending for Medicare Advantage have led to thousands of doctors being terminated from the program. We have been monitoring the impact of the cuts but have generally awarded this claim Two Pinocchios. We should note that\u2019s a bit more generous than our fact checker colleagues.\n\n1. As a retiree, Disney is already on Medicare, and thus would not be covered under any the versions of the Ryan plan. The plan would phase in for people who are currently younger than 55, as they reached retirement age. (The Grimes campaign has tried to dodge this by claiming that the Ryan\u2019s budget\u2019s repeal of the Affordable Care Act would affect current seniors, but that doesn\u2019t add up to $6,000.)\n\n2. The vote in question was on a motion to proceed on a nonbinding budget blueprint, which failed. So there was actually no vote on the budget plan itself, let alone on the legislation that would be needed to overhaul the program. This is a bit of technical issue, as McConnell made clear at the time he supported the Ryan budget and the concept of premium support.\n\nIn a September 2013 report, CBO found that the \u201caverage-bid\u201d option would actually provide savings for beneficiaries; the same report essentially retracted the 2011 analysis that formed the basis of CBPP\u2019s $6,000 projection. The nonpartisan agency said the 2011 report was a \u201crough analysis\u201d and that the results are now \u201csubstantially different,\u201d in part because of \u201csubstantial improvements in CBO\u2019s modeling of the behavior of beneficiaries and insurers.\u201d The earlier report also assumed that health-care spending covered by private plans would be much higher at first and then grow faster than currently estimated \u2014 in part because Ryan\u2019s 2011 version did not include traditional Medicare as a bidding option.\n\nPremium support was a relatively new concept for Medicare when Ryan embraced it, and one can see the give-and-take of policymaking here. He\u2019s responding to CBO\u2019s analysis; CBO is responding to his changes and improving its own understanding of the concept. Interestingly, as Ryan has fiddled with the plan, the CBO\u2019s estimate of the possible budget savings has also shrunk. Saving money was originally a major impetus for Republicans to overhaul Medicare.\n\nStill, a good chunk of the spending reductions \u2014 $156 billion \u2014 would come at the expense of Medicare Advantage programs, used by nearly 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries and often favored by Republicans. The goal of the reduction is to put payments on a par with traditional fee-for-service Medicare, as Medicare Advantage now costs the government more. But there have been some documented shifts in the Medicare Advantage market that have impacted seniors.\n\nThe McConnell ad also tries to tie Grimes to the health-care law, but she has been very cagey on her support for it. She obviously has never voted for it. Thus the ad veers toward Three Pinocchios, but in the end we think we will stick with the Two Pinocchios we have given this $700 billion claim in the past. The $700 billion figure by itself is misleading, but the spending reductions have begun to have some impact on seniors in the Medicare Advantage programs, and that impact cannot be easily dismissed.", "lang": "en"}
