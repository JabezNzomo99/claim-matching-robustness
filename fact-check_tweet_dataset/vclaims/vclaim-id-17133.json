California agreed to notify its other counties to do the same.\n\nBut the settlement did not say that there was any fraudulent voting.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much he repeats them, Trump\u2019s lies about voter fraud are patently untrue,\u201d California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in a statement to FactCheck.org. \u201cSpecifically, the settlement with Judicial Watch, Los Angeles County, and the Secretary of State contains absolutely no admission to or evidence of \u2018illegal votes.\u2019 The President\u2019s claims are untrue and yet another distortion aimed at undermining confidence in our elections.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan\u2019s office also told us there was no such admission.\n\n\u201cWe have simply agreed to comply with the NVRA as interpreted by the Supreme Court and nothing in the agreement will jeopardize even one eligible Los Angeles County voter,\u201d Logan\u2019s office said in an email. \u201cThe agreement is about voter registration record keeping and interpretation of federal law, not about votes cast in any election.\u201d\n\nJudicial Watch did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nTrump, as we\u2019ve written, has repeatedly claimed without evidence that widespread voter fraud caused him to lose the popular vote to Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.\n\nUpdate, June 26: A spokesman for the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk\u2019s Office confirmed that 1.51 million notices have been sent to inactive voters.\n\nThe president also repeated several claims that we have previously debunked. Here are some of them:\n\nZero Tolerance: In defending his administration\u2019s policy that had caused families to be separated at the border, Trump said, \u201cYou know, under President Obama you had separation. I was the one that ended it.\u201d That\u2019s misleading.\n\nAs we have written, there were some separations under previous administrations, but the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy referred all illegal border crossers for criminal prosecution and, therefore, separated much larger numbers of parents from their children.\n\n\u201cHistorically, these separations were rare and occurred because of circumstances such as the parent\u2019s medical emergency or a determination that the parent was a threat to the child\u2019s safety,\u201d the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a January 2019 report.\n\nBut that changed, the report goes on to say, after the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy was put into effect in April 2018. \u201cAs a result, DHS separated large numbers of alien families, with adults being held in Federal detention while their children were transferred to the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),\u201d the IG report said.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, Trump \u201cstopped\u201d his own policy \u2014 not Obama\u2019s.\n\nIraq War: Trump repeated his unsubstantiated claim that he was against the war in Iraq before it started in March 2003. \u201cI was against going into Iraq for years and years. And before it ever happened I was against going into Iraq,\u201d he told Chuck Todd.\n\nAs we have written, there is no evidence that we could find, however, that he spoke against the war before it started, although we did find he expressed early concerns about the cost and direction of the war a few months after it started.\n\nIran Nuclear Agreement: In his criticism of the Iran nuclear deal, the president once again misleadingly said that Obama \u201cgave them $150 billion.\u201d\n\nAs we have written previously, the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, included China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. It lifted some sanctions, including a freeze on Iran\u2019s assets that were held largely in foreign banks. It wasn\u2019t a unilateral decision by the United States, nor was it U.S. money.\n\nAlso, the $150 billion figure used by Trump is a high-end estimate of the total that was freed up after some sanctions were lifted. But, as we have written, the U.S. Treasury Department has estimated that figure at about $50 billion in \u201cusable liquid assets,\u201d according to 2015 testimony from Adam Szubin, acting under secretary of treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.\n\nU.S. Economy: Trump misrepresented the state of the U.S. economy that he inherited in January 2017, claiming that \u201cwhen I took over, this country, the economy was ready to collapse.\u201d Actually, Trump inherited an economy experiencing steady if uneven growth. (See our Jan. 20, 2017, item, \u201cWhat President Trump Inherits.\u201d)\n\nIn the interview, Trump mentioned three economic measures \u2014 gross domestic product, jobs and consumer confidence. Real GDP had been trending up under Trump, growing at an annual rate of 3.2 percent during the first quarter of this year, after going up 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.2 percent in 2017. However, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s \u201cGDPNow\u201d forecast projects that the second-quarter growth rate will fall to 2.0 percent. It\u2019s worth noting, too, that the U.S. has had positive growth every year since 2010, reaching a high under Obama of 2.9 percent in 2015.\n\nAs for employment, the economy had added nearly 2.5 million jobs in the 12 months before Trump took office, measuring from January 2016 to January 2017. Under Obama, the economy gained jobs for 76 straight months, starting in October 2010 \u2013 a record at the time that has since been extended for another 28 months under Trump.\n\nConsumer confidence in the economy increased under both Obama and Trump. The University of Michigan\u2019s Surveys of Consumers reported that its Index of Consumer Sentiment was at 57.6 in October 2008, prior to Obama\u2019s election, and eight years later it was at 87.2 in October 2016, prior to Trump\u2019s election. The current level, as of May, is 100.\n\nWikiLeaks: When asked why he used emails and documents stolen by Russia and released by WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign, Trump responded by saying, \u201c[H]ow would I even know that?\u201d\n\nBut Trump repeatedly cited the stolen material at his rallies, even after the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement on Oct. 7, 2016, saying that the U.S. intelligence community is \u201cconfident\u201d that hacks into the email systems of the Democratic Party and its officials were directed by \u201cRussia\u2019s senior-most officials.\u201d\n\nAs we have written, Trump dismissed U.S. intelligence reports that Russia was behind the hacks at the final two debates on Oct. 9, 2016, and Oct. 19, 2016. In the last debate, Trump said \u201cour country has no idea\u201d who was behind the hacks.", "lang": "en"}
