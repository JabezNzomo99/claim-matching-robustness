Trump and Vice President Mike Pence canceled plans to address supporters outside of the arena as outdoor overflow crowds failed to materialize. The New York Times reported the president was stunned by the empty arena tiers, and a Tulsa official said 6,200 people were in an arena that had a 19,000-seat capacity.\n\n\"The media won\u2019t show this!\" begins one post featuring several photos of crowds. \"They are saying the place was empty! Puullease!! Lots of people!!!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) With good reason.\n\nThe first photo shows Trump during a rally at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Ind., in 2018.\n\nThe second photo and fourth photo have been online since 2016, when Trump appeared at a rally in Florida.\n\nThe third photo is from a Trump rally in Orlando in 2019.\n\nThe fifth photo is from a January 2020 rally in New Jersey.\n\nThe sixth photo does show Trump on the floor of the rally in Tulsa.\n\nAnd, finally, we couldn\u2019t find the original version of the seventh photo in the Facebook post. But following the lead of a Facebook commenter who debunked most of another post claiming to show crowds in Tulsa, it appears to show Rolling Thunder motorcycle riders in a Virginia parking lot in 2019.\n\nSix out of the seven images in this post claiming to show the crowds at Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally are not from Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally. The sole image from that event isn\u2019t immediately visible in the post; social media users must click through to see it.\n\nCorrection: This story originally said that the seventh photo shows motorcycle riders in a parking lot in Washington D.C. The parking lot is actually in Virginia.", "lang": "en"}
