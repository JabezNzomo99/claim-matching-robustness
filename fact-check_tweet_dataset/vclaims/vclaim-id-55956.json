The research behind the News Letter headline was conducted across the UK and the results were not broken down by region, so this UK finding cannot be applied to Northern Ireland without further area-specific evidence.\n\nA headline in a News Letter article published on Tuesday, 23 June 2020, on page 11 of the newspaper and online, claimed that \u201cOne in in [sic] four NI adults \u2018now at risk of hunger and malnutrition\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe sub-headline underneath elaborated: \u201cOne in four adults across NI have struggled to access affordable food under lockdown and are now susceptible to hunger and malnutrition, a UK-wide survey has found.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the food security of 25% of the population was determined in research from the charity Feeding Britain and Northumbria University\u2019s Healthy Living Lab. The research, which included people in NI, also found that one in four adults who look after children have eaten less so they can feed the children in their household.\u201d\n\nThe News Letter article was based on a short report (press release) by food poverty charity Feeding Britain and Northumbria University\u2019s Healthy Living Lab.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 Committee on World Food Security uses these working definitions:\n\nFood security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Household food security is the application of this concept to the family level, with individuals within households as the focus of concern.\n\nFood insecurity exists when people do not have adequate physical, social or economic access to food as defined above.\n\nThe continuum of food security and insecurity is usually broken into four categories:\n\u2022 \n\u2022 High food security: Households had no problems, or anxiety about, consistently accessing adequate food.\n\u2022 Marginal food security: Households had problems at times, or anxiety about, accessing adequate food, but the quality, variety, and quantity of their food intake were not substantially reduced.\n\u2022 Low food security: Households reduced the quality, variety, and desirability of their diets, but the quantity of food intake and normal eating patterns were not substantially disrupted.\n\u2022 Very low food security: At times during the year, eating patterns of one or more household members were disrupted and food intake reduced because the household lacked money and other resources for food.\n\nHouseholds with high or marginal food security are often defined as \u2018food secure\u2019 while those with low or very low food security are deemed to be \u2018food insecure\u2019. Another common grouping uses \u2018marginal food insecurity\u2019 to encompass households whose food security is \u2018marginal\u2019, \u2018low\u2019 or \u2018very low\u2019.\n\nWhat did this research find?\n\nFood security responses were broken down as follows:\n\u2022 \n\u2022 71.41% of adults reported living in a household with high food security, where they have no problem or limitation in accessing the food they need in sufficient quantity and quality.\n\u2022 9.36% of adults reported living in a household with marginal food security, where they are experiencing a shortage of food in the house and/or anxious about their ongoing ability to access and afford the food they need in sufficient quantity and quality.\n\u2022 8.50% of adults reported living in a household with low food security, where they are having to reduce the quantity and quality of their food, and consume meals which are mostly lacking in nutritional value and variety.\n\u2022 7.67% of adults reported living in a household with very low food security, where they frequently need to reduce their food intake, are hungry, or regularly go without food for long periods of time.\n\u2022 3.09% of respondents did not provide one of the above answers.\n\nAdding together the marginal, low and very low answers gives the result that 25.53% (one in four) of the adults surveyed across the UK did not have high food security.\n\nThe researchers concluded that these adults \u201chave struggled to access food they can afford. This is likely to have left them susceptible to hunger and potential malnutrition. They are living in households with, at best, moderate food security.\u201d\n\nThe research report states that \u201ca national representative survey was conducted in the week commencing 8 June 2020, by Prolific, and gathered 1,004 responses. The survey contained a range of questions relating to household food security and coping strategies during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nOne of the report\u2019s authors confirmed to FactCheckNI that the survey results were not broken down by region, so no Northern Ireland-specific figure is available.\n\nOther evidence about food security in Northern Ireland?\n\nThe News Letter article quoted Kevin Higgins from Advice NI, who said: \u201cI certainly see these figures as valid for Northern Ireland \u2026\u201d and went on to discuss the distribution of food boxes across Northern Ireland during the coronavirus pandemic, and the rise in claims for Universal Credit.\n\nThe 2014 Poverty and Social Exclusion (PSE) research found that \u201c29% of people [in Northern Ireland] have \u2018sometimes\u2019 or \u2018often\u2019 skimped on food so that others in the household would have enough to eat\u201d and \u201c7% of households can\u2019t afford regular fresh fruit and vegetables\u201d.\n\nThe Food and You Survey: Northern Ireland Report (2019) for the Food Standards Agency found that one in five people in Northern Ireland (20%) lived in households with marginal, low or very low food security. The level of marginal food insecurity was mostly consistent across England, Wales and Northern Ireland (Table 1.13) (charted below), and these proportions are at a similar level to those measured in a 2016 survey (Table 1.17).\n\nThe percentage of households in the 2019 study who were deemed to be food insecure (low or very low) was lower in Northern Ireland (7.8%) than England (9.9%) and Wales (10.0%).\n\nWhile there is evidence that food bank usage has increased in Northern Ireland during the pandemic, there are no specific statistics to prove whether the level of marginal food insecurity has risen from one in five to one in four people.\n\nImage: 63226160 by Ian Allenden used by license Dreamstime.com\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
