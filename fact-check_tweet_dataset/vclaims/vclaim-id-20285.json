His comments, in this instance, included no new factual information.\n\nIn its March 4 piece, RT wrote: \u201cThe \u2018detectives\u2019 at Bellingcat were not satisfied with \u201cidentifying\u201d Petrov and Boshirov. They set out to prove the men were actually super-secret Russian spies.\u201d It added that Bellingcat found that Boshirov \u201cwas really highly decorated commando Colonel Anatoly Chepiga, and Petrov was likewise a distinguished military physician Aleksandr Mishkin.\u201d\n\nDespite RT\u2019s use of sarcasm in its attempt to undermine Bellingcat\u2019s credibility, its anniversary article does not offer new evidence \u2013 even misstating the timeline of the investigation. RT appears to credit Bellingcat for \u201cnaming them as suspects and accusing them of being GRU.\u201d\n\nHowever in early September, nine days before Bellingcat\u2019s first report documenting peculiarities in the duo\u2019s passports and background, police in the UK identified Petrov and Boshirov. On that same day, British Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons the men were Russian agents.\n\nFollowing a late September Bellingcat article that identified Chepiga, who grew up in a small village near Russia\u2019s border with China, the accused agent was identified by local residents.\n\nOne woman told the Russian daily Kommersant that Chepiga served in \u201cthe secret service\u201d in various \u201chot spots\u201d after graduating from a military academy. Another told the BBC: \"I know where his parents used to live, that he was a military man. An officer. He fought in war zones, then he was in Moscow.\u201d\n\nShe added: \"It's him in the photos, of course.\"\n\nFormer neighbors also confirmed that Petrov was in fact Mishkin.\n\nYevgeny Sergeyevich, who grew up in Miskhin\u2019s home village of Loyga, told the Telegraph: \u201cHe [Mishkin] became a Hero of Russia three or four years ago. I heard about it from acquaintances in Loyga who are still in touch with him.\u201d\n\nAt the Far Eastern Military Academy where Chepiga was enrolled, Radio Liberty also found his portrait among those who had received the Hero of the Russian Federation award.\n\nMeanwhile, CCTV footage placed Chepiga and Mishkin on Wilton Road near the Skripals\u2019 home in Salisbury the day before the military-grade nerve agent Novichok was sprayed on the victims\u2019 door.\n\nThe police timeline had the suspects returning to Moscow on the same day the Skripals were poisoned.\n\nAs noted by the Guardian, Chepiga and Mishkin\u2019s Salisbury trip account, in the September 2018 RT broadcast, does not \u201cadd up.\u201d\n\nIronically, the RT piece says \u201cthere has been no shortage of often fanciful theories emanating from UK officialdom and NATO-backed \u2018open-source detectives\u2019 such as Bellingcat, but none have taken the world closer to knowing what actually happened.\u201d\n\nJust weeks after the attack, RFE/RL reported that the official Russian narrative was changing on a near daily basis.\n\nKings College London, last week, released a report that said Russian state media had published 138 narratives regarding the alleged Novichok attack, which the Russian Embassy in the UK characterized as \u201cseparate points on various aspects of the incident\u201d rather than separate \u201caccounts\u201d or \u201cversions.\u201d\n\nOne of those \u201cseparate points\u201d included the theory that two of the suspects in the attack were in fact British actors starring in a non-existent KGB spy series broadcast on British television in the 2000s, the BBC reported.\n\nBen Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told the British state-funded broadcaster: \"The more different theories you put out, the more different Google results you're going to get. So instead of seeing two or three different versions of the story you're seeing 20 or 30. And for someone who is not following the story regularly that becomes more and more confusing until they give up. And at that point, the Russian disinformation has had its effect.\"\n\nPolygraph finds that RT\u2019s claim regarding Bellingcat, along with its selective omission of facts, to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
