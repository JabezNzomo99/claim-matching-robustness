However, alcohol-based hand-sanitizers complement but do not replace proper hand-washing with soap and water.\u201d\n\nLee also pointed us to a recent Smithsonian Magazine article, citing multiple sources and scientific papers, that discusses the effectiveness of hand sanitizers. That article, citing Lee, noted that \u201c[w]hile soap physically dismantles the envelope using brute force, alcohol changes the envelope\u2019s chemical properties, making it less stable and more permeable to the outside world.\u201d\n\nThe article continued: \u201cAlcohol also can penetrate deep into the pathogen\u2019s interior, wreaking havoc on proteins throughout the virus. (Importantly, not all viruses come with outer envelopes. Those that don\u2019t, like the viruses that cause HPV and polio, won\u2019t be susceptible to soap, and to some extent alcohol, in the same way.)\u201d\n\nExperts recommend working the sanitizer fully over both hands until completely dry.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
