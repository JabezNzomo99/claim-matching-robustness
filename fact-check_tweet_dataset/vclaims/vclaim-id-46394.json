The equivalent of going to a voting machine, or maybe even sometimes better.\u201d\n\nVoting experts told us the verification process is the same for absentee and mail-in ballots, and many states consider them to be the same thing.\n\nAs many states attempt to ramp up mail-in ballot options in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Trump has positioned himself as a staunch opponent, claiming that if states expand mail-in voting it will result in a \u201crigged election.\u201d\n\nIn a radio interview with Michael Savage on June 15, Trump warned that an expansion of mail-in ballots would increase \u201cthe chance of theft, where they steal them, they hold up mailmen, they take them out of mailboxes, they print them fraudulently.\u201d Trump said a friend whose son died seven years ago told him that he recently received a ballot in his son\u2019s name. \u201cThese mistakes are made by the millions,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSome in the media have pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of Trump\u2019s position on mail-in voting, given that he voted by mail in the Florida primary this year.\n\nIn his interview with Savage, Trump said his criticism of mail-in ballots did not extend to \u201cabsentee\u201d ballots like the one he has said he cast.\n\n\u201cGo to a voting booth and vote,\u201d Trump said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re an absentee, in which case they have to go through a whole process. In order to vote, they have to go through a very strict process. The equivalent of going to a voting machine, or maybe even sometimes better.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Trump has made this false distinction. Asked in a press briefing on April 7 what the difference was between someone voting by mail in-state versus out-of-state, Trump claimed, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a big difference between somebody that\u2019s out of state and does a ballot and everything is sealed, certified, and everything else.\u201d\n\nIn fact, election officials say states use the same verification/certification process for absentee or mail-in ballots.\n\nAs we mentioned, Trump voted by mail in Florida in March. Trump called it an \u201cabsentee\u201d ballot.\n\n\u201cAbsentee is okay,\u201d Trump said in remarks on May 26. \u201cYou\u2019re sick. You\u2019re away. As an example, I have to do an absentee because I\u2019m voting in Florida, and I happen to be president. I live in that very beautiful house over there that\u2019s painted white. So that\u2019s okay. And it\u2019s okay for people that are sick and they can\u2019t get up. Something. You know, something.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, who has voted by mail in Florida 11 times since 2010, according to the Tampa Bay Times, echoed that line.\n\n\u201cAbsentee voting has the word absent in it for a reason. It means you\u2019re absent from the jurisdiction or unable to vote in person,\u201d McEnany wrote in a statement to the Tampa Bay Times. \u201cPresident Trump is against the Democrat plan to politicize the coronavirus and expand mass mail-in voting without a reason, which has a high propensity for voter fraud. This is a simple distinction that the media fails to grasp.\u201d\n\nNever mind that, as the Orlando Sentinel noted, Trump could have voted in person in Florida if he wanted to. The paper reported that the president \u201cwas in Palm Beach County, where he\u2019s made his Mar-a-Lago Club his legal address for voting purposes,\u201d for several days during the state\u2019s early voting period in March. In fact, the Sentinel said, early voting was offered in a library right across the street from the Trump International Golf Club where Trump spent some of his time.\n\nMore important, Florida doesn\u2019t have absentee voting, per se. For decades, it has had vote-by-mail, which is available to any eligible voter in the state. Florida is one of 34 states (plus Washington, D.C.) that have \u201cno excuse\u201d absentee or mail-in voting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In other words, voters do not need to attest that they will be out of the voting jurisdiction on election day, or that they cannot get to the polls because of an illness or disability. So there is no special process that \u201cabsentee\u201d out-of-town voters go through that other mail-in voters do not.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments regarding absentee and mail-in ballots are misleading,\u201d Darren Hutchinson, a law professor at the University of Florida and an elections expert, told us via email. \u201cThe differences between the two systems are trivial. To vote by absentee ballot, a voter must provide a reason, usually travel or disability, to excuse in-person voting. The absentee ballot label, however, is somewhat of a relic. Most states, including Florida, have moved to \u2018no-excuse\u2019 mail-in ballots. In these states, individuals can submit a mail-in ballot without explaining their absence on election day. They simply need to submit an application virtually identical to the one states use for absentee ballots.\n\n\u201cThere is no rigid screening process that distinguishes the two methods of voting,\u201d Hutchinson added. \u201cOnce registration and address are verified, the elections office will process the request and send the ballot. In Florida, almost 30% of votes in the last presidential election were cast by mail, and voters did not have to provide an excuse, be absent from the state, or go through an enhanced screening process. On this issue, Trump is simply wrong.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, Hutchinson said, elections officials compare signatures on the returned ballots with the signatures on the voter registration forms.\n\n\u201cIf, in the opinion of the elections officials, the signatures do not match (or if [someone] fails to sign the ballot), a voter would be contacted and allowed to cure the defect,\u201d Hutchinson said.\n\nThat\u2019s a little different than the process for in-person voting in Florida, as poll workers ask for a picture ID. But even without an ID card, he said, a person must be allowed to cast a provisional ballot.\n\nIn response to fears that in-person voting in November will spread SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, a number of states have sought to expand mail-in voting.\n\nStates including Michigan, Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia have mailed absentee or mail-in ballot applications to registered voters. Other states, such as California and Nevada, have sent actual mail-in ballots to all registered voters in their states. Trump has singled out several of those states \u2014 particularly ones with Democratic governors \u2014 making false and misleading claims about their actions regarding mail-in voting.\n\nFor example, on May 20, the president erroneously tweeted that Michigan\u2019s Democratic secretary of state was \u201cillegally\u201d sending \u201cabsentee ballots to 7.7 million people\u201d for this year\u2019s primary and general elections, though the state actually said it will send absentee ballot applications \u2014 not actual ballots \u2014 to all registered voters who may want to vote by mail.\n\nA week later, Trump falsely claimed on Twitter and at the White House that California was sending mail-in ballots to \u201canyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there\u201d and \u201cpeople that aren\u2019t citizens.\u201d As we wrote, California will send every registered voter in the state a mail-in ballot for the November general election.\n\n\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that mailed ballots are rife with voter fraud and, if expanded, would taint the presidential election. We\u2019ve written before about such claims, noting that experts say the president is exaggerating, and that while the instances of voter fraud via mail-in or absentee ballots are more common than in-person voting fraud, the number of known cases is relatively rare.\n\nHere, however, we are focusing on the president\u2019s repeated claims that absentee ballots are subject to greater scrutiny than other mail-in ballots.\n\n\u201cThe President has no idea what he is talking about,\u201d said Sam Mahood, press secretary for the California secretary of state, the office that oversees the state\u2019s elections.\n\nMahood told us via email there\u2019s no difference between absentee and mail-in ballots in California.\n\n\u201cFor nearly 20 years, California has allowed voters to register to permanently vote-by-mail, no excuse needed,\u201d Mahood said. \u201cThere are simply \u2018vote-by-mail\u2019 ballots in California, we don\u2019t use the term \u2018absentee\u2019 any more as there are no excuses or qualifications needed to vote-by-mail.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornia county elections officials check each and every vote-by-mail ballot that is cast, so even if a ballot was sent to the wrong voter it would be caught,\u201d Mahood said. \u201cElections officials check to see if the voter has cast a ballot elsewhere. Every vote-by-mail ballot also has a unique bar code that elections officials scan. A voter\u2019s signature on the vote-by-mail ballot return envelope is compared against the voter\u2019s registration record. If a signature is missing or does not match the registration record, elections officials will reach out to the voter. If the voter does not respond and provide a missing/corrected signature, the ballot will not count.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Michigan secretary of state said the president\u2019s claim has no merit in Michigan either.\n\n\u201cAbsentee ballots and mail-in ballots are the same thing,\u201d said Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat who also has found herself a target of Trump\u2019s mail-in balloting barbs.\n\n\u201cIn Michigan you have the option of submitting your absentee ballot to a drop box or in person at your clerk\u2019s office, but the vast majority are mailed in,\u201d Wimmer told us via email. \u201cThe verification process \u2014 signature matching when you request a ballot and when the ballot is returned \u2014 is the same.\u201d\n\nFive states already conduct elections primarily by mail-in vote: Utah, Colorado, Hawaii, Washington and Oregon. All of them will send registered voters a mail-in ballot in advance of the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures and the individual state election materials.\n\nIn Utah, all but two counties automatically sent ballots to registered voters in the 2018 elections, and this year\u2019s June 30 primary will be conducted primarily by mail, due to the coronavirus pandemic, with no regular polling places available in all but one county.\n\n\u201cIn my state, I\u2019ll bet 90% of us vote by mail,\u201d Utah Sen. Mitt Romney said in May. \u201cIt works very, very well, and it\u2019s a very Republican state.\u201d\n\nMatthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that while the verification process for mail-in ballots can vary by state, the states do not treat absentee and mail-in ballots any differently. The only new twist is that some states have, for the first time, sent out ballots or ballot applications as a way to promote vote-by-mail this year due to the coronavirus. States that already primarily use vote-by-mail are better positioned to handle verification, Weil told us, as they tend to have better technology for things like signature verification and bar codes to track ballots, and they keep better voter registration lists.\n\nThe coronavirus relief bill included $400 million for states to allow them to expand mail-in or early voting. The Brennan Center for Justice estimated that it would cost $982 million to $1.4 billion on top of what states are spending now to ensure a vote-by-mail option is available to all voters in November.\n\nWhether some states are up to the task of providing safe and secure mail-in ballots, or whether in-person voting is preferable, is a matter for political debate. But the president is wrong to repeatedly insist that absentee ballots \u2014 like the one he said he cast in March \u2014 include \u201ca very strict process\u201d that mail-in ballots do not.", "lang": "en"}
