The tweet attracted more than 2,300 reactions.\n\nsays it works with health insurers to make malaria care affordable. Subscribers to its services can get treatment for N450 a month (about US$1.20).\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s most populous country. But does it lose this many people to malaria?\n\n\u2018Our data is from the WHO\u2019\n\nA WellaHealth executive, Olanrewaju Akintobi, attributed the figure to the\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just cook up data. The figure you are referring to came from WHO,\u201d Akintobi told Africa Check.\n\nWellaHealth founder Dr Ikpeme Neto told us the figure was from a\n\n\u201cfrom the US Department of State that quotes figures from the WHO\u201d. The factsheet however did not specifically attribute this number to the UN agency.\n\nNeto said that while malaria deaths in Nigeria had fallen recently, they may have been undercounted. He sent us an August 2019\n\nThe paper concluded that the burden of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa was \u201cconsiderably underestimated\u201d when anaemia was not considered. We have contacted the researchers for more details.\n\nby US news organisation CNN that said malaria cases had risen in more than 13 countries, including Nigeria. He said WellaHealth believed \u201cthe higher number is closer to the reality on the ground\u201d.\n\nThe CNN report was based on the WHO\u2019s 2018\n\nThe WHO report estimates that there were\n\nglobally in 2017, a decrease from 451,000 deaths in 2016.\n\nIf there were 300,000 malaria deaths in Nigeria, this would have been 69% of the global toll.\n\nBut the report puts Nigeria\u2019s share of global malaria deaths in 2017 at 19%, or\n\n. Deaths could have been as low\n\n. This estimate is the lowest since 2010.\n\nNigeria did see an increase in malaria cases -\n\nin 2016 to 53.7 million in 2017.\n\nBut it was \u201cdefinitely incorrect\u201d to say malaria killed 300,000 people in Nigeria a year, Dr Audu Mohammed, who coordinates the country\u2019s\n\n\u201cMaybe the figure came from WHO reports of more than 10 years ago when Nigeria recorded a lot more deaths from malaria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe primary data used for Nigeria in WHO\u2019s malaria reports come from us. And I can tell you that annual estimates for malaria deaths in the country have not been that high in recent years.\u201d\n\n, showed that cases and deaths were falling, Mohammed said. The next survey, due in 2020, would \u201cgive us a clearer picture\u201d.\n\nWhat of the anaemia question?\n\nMalaria-related deaths from anaemia complications were considered when estimating Nigeria\u2019s toll, Prof\n\n, the malaria technical director at the\n\n\u201cPeople that die of malaria don\u2019t just die, they usually die due to complications. We count malaria-related deaths resulting from all complications, including anaemia, which is the highest on our list of such complications,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBesides, our Health Management Information System and the statistical model used by WHO takes care of all forms of under-reporting or poor quality data.\u201d Mokuolu is also a professor of paediatrics at the\n\nand a consultant for the WHO.\n\nConclusion: 81,640, not 300,000 lives, lost to malaria in Nigeria each year\n\nTo highlight the burden of malaria in Nigeria, a tech start-up said the disease killed an average of 300,000 people in the country a year.\n\nThe company said the number was from the World Health Organization. But the WHO\u2019s most recent report estimates a much lower toll \u2013 81,640 deaths in 2017.\n\nBut there is still work to be done to combat the mosquito-borne disease, as the rising number of malaria cases in the country shows.", "lang": "en"}
