This is false. Macron made no such comments on Twitter or via any other platform.\n\nThe article, posted on a website called The Pointer News on December 29, 2018, claimed that Macron called on African leaders to support Biafran independence. The comments were supposed to have been made in a tweet posted on Tuesday December 25. \u201cAll Africa leaders should rises to their responsibility, to ensure Biafra stood as a nation, before it get out of hand,\" the post quoted Macron as saying.\n\nA unilateral declaration of an independent republic of Biafra for the Igbo people who dominate southeast Nigeria was made in 1967, sparking a brutal civil war with federal forces that lasted 30 months.\n\nIn all, more than one million people died from the effects of conflict, starvation and disease, most of them Igbos.\n\nThe Biafran side was led by Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, who would later flee to Ivory Coast, a former French colony, after the war. France was one of the few countries to back the fledgling republic of Biafra.\n\nMore than 50 years after the civil war started, Nnamdi Kanu, a British-Nigerian political activist and former London estate agent, seized on latent secessionist sentiment in the southeast as head of a movement called the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) and resurrected calls for an Igbo nation.\n\nThe post by The Pointer News claims that Macron is endorsing Biafra\u2019s bid to secede from Nigeria.\n\nBut AFP found no tweet in December or at any other date in which the current French head of state shows support for Biafran separatism. The only tweet put out by Macron\u2019s official account on December 25 was a Christmas greeting from him and his wife, Brigitte.\n\n\u201cBrigitte joins me in wishing a Merry Christmas to all of you,\u201d Macron tweeted.\n\nThe French foreign ministry in Paris told AFP that the president made no such comments, on or off social media.\n\n\"We vigorously deny these remarks attributed to President Macron. There has been no tweet or comment on his part on this subject,\" the ministry said.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has declared IPOB a terrorist organisation and its leader -- who has resurfaced in Israel and Britain in recent months -- is on trial in Nigeria for treason.\n\nFacebook posts widely shared among pro-Biafra groups also claimed that US President Donald Trump made comments about the group at the United Nations. AFP checked and found it was false; Trump made no mention of IPOB or Biafra.", "lang": "en"}
