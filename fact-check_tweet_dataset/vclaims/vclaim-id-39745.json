This was also widely reported.\n\nBBC News also tweeted and then deleted a tweet about an article which ran with \u201c40 new hospitals\u201d in the headline, replacing it with \u201cGovernment plans billions for hospital projects\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the government in this announcement has only allocated funding for six hospitals to receive building work by 2025. Up to 38 other hospitals will receive money to develop plans for upgrades between 2025 and 2030, but not to undertake any building work.\n\nThere is money to upgrade six hospitals\n\nThe government says \u201cWe\u2019re giving the green light to more than 40 new hospital projects across the country, six getting the go-ahead immediately, and over 30 that could be built over the next decade\u201d.\n\nIt has confirmed that six hospitals in England are being given \u00a32.7 billion by 2025 as part of a \u201cnew hospital building programme\u201d. For example, one of the hospitals earmarked for the money is Whipps Cross in London. Its initial plans involve building a new hospital on the existing site, which will take up less space and \u201cbrings all the hospital\u2019s services closer together under one roof. The remainder of the estate would be released for\u2026 new homes and community facilities\u201d.\n\nAnother 21 hospital trusts are being given \u00a3100 million in seed funding to prepare a business case for their hospitals\u2014but no money for any actual building work. The plan is for works on these hospitals to take place between 2025 and 2030.\n\nThe government says that seed funding will cover 34 hospitals, and has also published a list of which hospitals are included. By our count, there are 38 hospitals listed (if you count all 12 community hospitals in Dorset which are listed as \u201cpotentially\u201d getting funding). Presumably, the 34 extra hospitals needed to reach the total figure of 40 are to be found within this list of 38, and we\u2019ve asked the Department of Health and Social Care for more information on this.\n\nExperts welcome the \u201cmuch needed\u201d money, but say it isn\u2019t enough\n\nThe health think tank the Health Foundation has said: \u201cThe government\u2019s announcement today amounts to almost \u00a33bn of additional capital funding over the next 5 years focused on upgrading six NHS hospitals. While this money is very much needed following years of underinvestment in the NHS's crumbling infrastructure, it falls well short of the scale of the challenge. With a backlog of maintenance and repairs that amounts to more than \u00a36bn \u2013 much of which threatens patient's safety \u2013 and dozens of NHS trust upgrade projects that have been delayed or cancelled, the figure needed is closer to \u00a33bn each year for the next 5 years.\u201d\n\nAnother health think tank, the King\u2019s Fund has said: \u201cOn the face of it, the various schemes being pledged by the government certainly sound like substantial investment, but these piecemeal announcements are not the same as having a proper, multi-year capital funding plan. The lack of clarity around how the new schemes have been selected and how the pledges fit within the Department for Health and Social Care's overall financial settlement makes it difficult to tell how generous the government is being.\u201d\n\nChris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers which represents NHS trusts, said \u201cWe have led calls for more capital funding to rebuild our NHS so we welcome this significant and important new commitment.\n\n\u201cThe new \u00a33 billion that\u2019s been committed for 2020-25 will be particularly good news for the patients and staff in the six acute hospitals that will directly benefit. We welcome the Government\u2019s intention to fund a further 21 schemes between 2025 and 2030 and the \u00a3100 million for those organisations to start work on developing those projects, noting that the funding to complete those schemes remains to be allocated.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only government announcement that has come under fire in recent months for not offering what it initially seemed to.\n\nIn his first speech on becoming Prime Minister, Boris Johnson announced that 20 hospitals would be receiving upgrades. That was on the 24 July. It wasn\u2019t until almost two weeks later that the full list of hospitals in England and some details about the spending they would receive were published.\n\nWe then fact checked that announcement: that \u00a31.8 billion of new money was being given to the NHS, part of which would be spent on the 20 hospitals. After much to and fro we found this claim all depends on how you define \u2018new money\u2019. While the Treasury will have to increase spending by this amount over the next five years, some of it is money that NHS trusts had already earned, but were subsequently told they couldn\u2019t spend.\n\nIt took us three weeks to get a response from the Department of Health and Social Care on this and even then it didn\u2019t provide us with any information which clarified the situation. The Office for Statistics Regulation has asked the department to explain fully where the money is coming from.\n\nThe Johnson government is hardly the first to try and present policy announcements in the most favourable light. But the principle here is pretty simple: if governments want to issue major policy announcements with large headline figures, they should provide details of where the funding is coming from, or which institutions will receive it and when. And they should be able to provide that information at the time they make the announcement, not weeks later.", "lang": "en"}
