In the viral video, some Sikhs can be seen distributing food to people from outside the train. It has been claimed that Sikhs are distributing food to hungry migrants sitting in the train. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral claim is false. This video is getting viral from November 2019, it has nothing to do with the migrants.\n\nA video shared on social media shows some Sikhs distributing food to people in the train. The caption reads: \u201cOne of the best videos you will see today, which shows humanity exists in these difficult times. Sikhs in rural India run after a moving train filled with starving migrants to give them food.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nIn order to verify the video, we observed hints that were visible while looking at the video carefully. We could see the name \u2018Mahalam\u2019 written on the board at the railway station. Mahalam is located near Firozpur, Punjab.\n\nWe searched keywords such as \u201cSikh langar moving train\u201d on google. From the search result, we found that the video is old and not the recent one. We found the same video on Twitter uploaded on November 12, 2019. This video was uploaded from a Twitter handle of a user named Hatinder Singh. The description with the video read: \u201cLangar Started By First Sikh Guru Sri Guru Nanak Devji Has Made This Religion Unique Serving Langar To The Hungry Beyond His Caste & Religion Is A Duty Towards Humanity. In The Video We Can See Sikhs Youth Running Behind Moving Train To Give Langar Food To The Hungry Passengers.\u201d\n\nThis was clear that the video is old and not related to the recent lockdown.\n\nWe further investigated and found an article on the website of Navbharat Times. The article dated November 14, 2019 was titled: \u2018\u0926\u0941\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u093f\u0916\u094b\u0902 \u091c\u0948\u0938\u0940 \u0938\u0947\u0935\u093e \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0915\u0930 \u0938\u0915\u0924\u093e\u2019 (English translation: Nobody in the world can do service as Sikhs do).\n\nAs per this article, the former BJP MLA Anil Sharma uploaded a video on November 12, on Guru Nanak Jayanti, in which Sikhs are distributing langars with a moving train. This video is becoming quite viral and millions of people have watched it till now.\n\nThe report on this can be read in Patrika and Navbharat times.\n\nVishvas News spoke to the Firozpur Incharge of Punjabi Jagran Mr. Parminder Singh. He said: \u201cThis is not the recent video. It is an old video. If we see the video carefully we can see that people are wearing winter-wears. This video is of Guru Nanak Dev ji\u2019s 550th anniversary.\u201d\n\nWe also spoke to the Superintendent of Mahalam Railway Station, Mr. Krishan Lal. He said: \u201cThis is an old video. It is of that time when people were going to Sultanpur Lodhi at the time of Guru Nanak Dev Ji\u2019s anniversary. This video was shot outside station premises.\u201d\n\nWe also performed the social scanning of the user who shared the viral post. The twitter user Asjad Nazir has a verified twitter account and he is a writer by profession.\n\nConclusion: Vishvas news investigated and found the claim to be false. The video was shot in November last year and has no relation with migrants during lockdown.", "lang": "en"}
