Its headline claimed that a Maulvi was arrested in a case of sexual exploitation after 52 girls were rescued from a Madrasa. The Twitter account accused the media of not covering the issue and diverting all its attention to Chinmayanand. BJP politician Chinmayanand was recently accused of rape by a law student from Uttar Pradesh. The woman was arrested by the Special Investigation Team after the politician filed a case of extortion against her.\n\nThe headline of the alleged clipping reads, \u201c\u092e\u0926\u0930\u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092f\u094c\u0928 \u0936\u094b\u0937\u0923, \u092e\u094c\u0932\u0935\u0940 \u0917\u093f\u0930\u092b\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0930 52 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u090f\u0902 \u091b\u0941\u095c\u093e\u0908 \u0917\u0908 .\u201d\n\nThe same post has also been shared by many on Facebook.

Not one, not two, but it\u2019s a case involving 52 girls aged between 8 and 18.)\u201d\n\nThe alleged newspaper clipping is viral on both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA careful glance at the clipping suggests that it has been altered. The word \u2018\u092e\u094c\u0932\u0935\u0940\u2019 (Maulvi) does not have the same font as the rest of the words in the headline.\n\u2022 The font is bigger. This is apparent in the image below where the alphabets of the word \u2018\u092e\u094c\u0932\u0935\u0940\u2019 cross the red line.\n\u2022 The matra or vowel sign \u2018\u0914\u2019 in \u2018\u092e\u094c\u0932\u0935\u0940\u2019 does not match with the same sign used in the word \u2018\u092f\u094c\u0928\u2019.\n\u2022 Furthermore, a black border is present all along the top and bottom of the newspaper clipping is missing only above the word \u2018\u092e\u094c\u0932\u0935\u0940\u2019.\n\nThe strapline below the title of the alleged clipping reads, \u201c\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0940\u0928\u0917\u0902\u091c \u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0925 \u092e\u0926\u0930\u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0918\u093f\u0928\u094c\u0928\u0940 \u0939\u0930\u0915\u0924 : \u091b\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0928\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0928\u093f\u0915\u0947\u0924\u0928 \u092d\u0947\u091c\u093e (Disgusting action in Yasingunj-based Madrasa : Girl students sent to women\u2019s home.)\u201d Upon searching for the same on Google, we found that this clipping represents a 2017 report published by Amar Ujala. As evident in the screenshot below, the headline does not say \u2018\u092e\u094c\u0932\u0935\u0940\u2019 (Maulvi) but \u2018\u092e\u0948\u0928\u0947\u091c\u0930\u2019 (manager).\n\nAccording to Amar Ujala, several girls were held hostage and sexually harassed in a madrasa in Yasinganj, Sadaatganj in Lucknow. The issue came to light after notes written by the girls, describing their ordeal, were found outside the Madrasa. The police were informed on December 29, 2017, after locals spotted the chits tossed by the girls from a window. 52 girls were rescued from the building and sent to a women\u2019s home.\n\nIt further added that the madrasa\u2019s manager Kari Taiyab Zia was arrested after the girls accused him of sexual exploitation, assault and torture. The madrasa was owned by religious master Syed Mohammad Jilani Ashraf, a resident of Hhadijatul Kubra Lil Banat Indiranagar, who left Zia in-charge. A family member of Ashraf also informed the police about the sexual exploitation.\n\nThe online version of the Amar Ujala report can be accessed here.\n\nThe issue was reported by other media outlets as well. The Indian Expresspublished the statements given by accused Zia who blamed Ashraf for levelling false allegations.\n\nA two-year-old newspaper clipping was photoshopped and shared on social media amidst allegations of rape on BJP politician Chinmayanand. While the incident represented in the clipping indeed took place, the police had arrested the manager of the madrasa and not a Maulvi.", "lang": "en"}
