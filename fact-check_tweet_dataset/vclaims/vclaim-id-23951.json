On July 29, she unveiled her own plan in a post on Medium \u2014 a hybrid version that extends the phase-in to a new system from four to 10 years and allows a role for insurance companies (which Sanders\u2019s plan would bar) to participate.\n\nOne option would require a 7.5 percent payroll tax that employers would pay to help fund the program. Virtually every economist will tell you that a payroll tax paid by an employer largely comes out of the pay earned by the employee, but Sanders argues that the savings on the premiums currently paid by the employer should result in an overall reduction in costs for the employer. He estimates that a company would save more than $9,000 in health-care costs per average employee. (We do not vouch for these numbers.)\n\n\u201cLast year, the typical working family paid an average of $5,277 in premiums to private health insurance companies. Under this option, a typical family of four earning $50,000, after taking the standard deduction, would pay a 4 percent income-based premium to fund Medicare-for-all \u2014 just $844 a year \u2014 saving that family over $4,400 a year. Because of the standard deduction, families of four making less than $29,000 a year would not pay this premium.\u201d\n\nHarris looks at this provision and claims it \u201chits the middle class too hard.\u201d Instead, she would keep the first $100,000 in income from taxation and instead levy a new tax on stock, bond and derivative transactions. A stock trade worth $1,000 would be subject to a $2 tax, for instance. She claims that \u201cthese proposals would raise well over $2 trillion over 10 years, more than enough to make up the difference from raising the middle-class income threshold.\u201d\n\nMichael Linden, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute who broke down the numbers for the campaign, says Sanders\u2019s original estimate of $3.5 trillion over 10 years may have been a bit too high, but Harris would need to raise $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion to make up for her proposal. \u201cA 0.1% equivalent Financial Transactions Tax has been estimated to raise between $700 billion and $800 billion, and Sen. Harris is proposing to double that rate, which would roughly double the revenue,\u201d he said. (The Congressional Budget Office came up with that estimate for its list of options to reduce the federal budget deficit.)\n\nBut notice how Sanders framed his original proposal: This is a way to collect premiums to pay for health care. Medicare currently requires participants to pay premiums. Beneficiaries with tax returns of less than or equal to $85,000 currently pay $135.50, or about $1,600, a year. So for someone making $50,000, that would mean their premiums would be cut in half.\n\nHarris, by contrast, would eliminate the need for anyone to pay any premiums until they make more than $100,000, a level that would protect most American households from additional tax. The Census Bureau says about 30 percent of U.S. households had income above $100,000 in 2017, but adjusted gross income for tax filing purposes could mean all but 20 percent of tax filers would be subject to the premium tax. (Linden says raising the threshold to $100,000 will exempt roughly 50 percent to 55 percent of income from the threshold \u2014 on top of the income already exempted by the $29,000 threshold.)\n\nUnder Harris\u2019s plan, the burden would shift almost entirely to the wealthy. Not only would they face an additional tax on each stock or bond sale, but their premiums would skyrocket. Someone making $500,000 to $750,000 currently pays about $5,500 in annual premiums for Medicare; that would go as high as $29,000 a year under the Sanders proposal.\n\nMeanwhile, as our colleagues at PolitiFact documented, Sanders\u2019s pitch that \u201caverage middle-class families will save $3,000 each and every year on their health-care bills\u201d is not supported by the studies cited by the campaign. For instance, a 2016 study done by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice concluded that workers would gain higher wages as employers faces lower costs for premiums, which in turn would offset the impact of higher taxes. People making $39,000 to $62,000 would see a gain of net income of $3,240, the study said.\n\nSanders acknowledges that he will raise taxes on most Americans, but argues that all but the wealthy will experience a net gain in income. Harris is trying to one-up him by saying that she would not impose additional taxes on the middle class, even though Sanders\u2019s pitch is exactly the opposite \u2014 that the middle class will experience higher incomes and lower health-care costs. She sidesteps the issue of whether most Americans should pay some kind of premium to get their health care, as they do currently under both Medicare and Obamacare.", "lang": "en"}
