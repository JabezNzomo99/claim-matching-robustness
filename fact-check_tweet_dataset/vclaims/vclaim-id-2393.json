It is actually a continuously looping snippet taken from a nature documentary about Cuba:\n\nThe relevant part is about 4:20 in. It shows the annual migration of thousands of crabs near the Bay of Pigs in Cuba (more here). Don't be fooled by hoax videos like this: liking, sharing and commenting on them will get the owners of the page that posted it more visibility on Facebook (which is probably the reason why they posted a faked video. Don't help them, instead post the original video if you liked it.", "lang": "en"}
