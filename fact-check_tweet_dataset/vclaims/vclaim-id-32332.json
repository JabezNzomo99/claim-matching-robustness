He died at age 64 near Barstow, California, after crashing to the ground in a steam-powered rocket he built for himself.\n\nWhy did Hughes launch himself in a rocket? As he explained it, the goal was to take a photo from space to \u201cprove\u201d the Earth is flat. He\u2019d been trying for years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in science,\u201d Hughes told the Associated Press in 2017 as he prepared for a launch sponsored by a group called Research Flat Earth. \u201cI know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air, about the certain size of rocket nozzles, and thrust. But that\u2019s not science, that\u2019s just a formula. There\u2019s no difference between science and science fiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take anyone else\u2019s word for it,\u201d he said in a February 2018 BBC interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the Earth is flat or round \u2026 I just couldn\u2019t dismiss it (flat Earth theory) after four to five months researching this.\u201d\n\nIn a video profile published by NBC in 2018, Hughes spoke about how he came to believe in flat-earth theory while doing \u201cresearch.\u201d He also spoke about finding places on Earth that were flat.\n\n\u201cYou start finding these places that\u2019s flat on this planet,\u201d Hughes said in that interview. \u201cKansas is flat. I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ve been there, it\u2019s flat.\u201d\n\nIn a trailer for the 2019 documentary Rocketman, about Hughes\u2019 experiments in rocket-building, Hughes said: \u201cI believe in the geocentric, flat-Earth model.\u201d\n\nIn March 2019, Hughes survived an initial launch in his rocket after reaching an altitude of nearly 1,900 feet. His next attempt \u2013 which took place on February 22 of this year -- was his last.\n\nVideo of that final attempt shows the rocket\u2019s drag-chute apparently separating almost immediately upon takeoff. With no parachute, the rocket crashed to the ground.\n\nMany may find it hard to believe anyone still adheres to a theory so obviously ludicrous, but the flat earth conspiracy has gained popularity. Flat-earthers accuse NASA and the international science community of concealing the \u201ctrue\u201d nature of the Earth.\n\nIn 2017, Aric Toler, a researcher at the fact-checking site Bellingcat, found a bizarre subset of flat-earthers who may be \u201cinspired\u201d by the \u201calt-right\u201d movement.\n\n\u201cLacking a grasp on gravity and basic physics,\u201d Toler wrote, \u201cmany flat earth believers assert that it is impossible to be \u2018upside-down\u2019 on Antarctica, and only a flat earth would explain why penguins do not fall off into space while at the \u2018bottom\u2019 of the world.\u201d\n\nSo much for centuries of science. But Hughes\u2019 death by gravity isn\u2019t the only example of how conspiracy theories can cause real harm.\n\nTake the anti-vaccine movement, which has been blamed for the resurgence of diseases like measles that were all but eradicated from developed nations.\n\nAnti-vaccine sentiments are typically driven by the false claim that vaccines cause autism in children. Fear of autism has opened the door to a host of \u201calternative medicine\u201d disinformation offering miracle \u201ccures\u201d for the condition.\n\nOne of the most dangerous examples is known as MMS, or Miracle Mineral Solution. Though it has been billed as a treatment for autism and a variety of ailments from HIV/AIDS to cancer, it is actually an industrial bleach. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned against the solution, listing harmful effects such as severe nausea, dehydration and acute liver failure. In April, Amazon.com banned the sale of a book recommending the fake \u201ctreatment\u201d on its website.\n\nMore recently, an email hoax perpetrated in Ukraine led to mass protests in which demonstrators attempted to block hospitals and buses containing evacuees from Wuhan, epicenter of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. BuzzFeed reported that a viral email claiming to be from Ukraine\u2019s health ministry told readers that some of the evacuees were suspected to be infected with the virus. Although the evacuees were on their way to a medical facility where they would be under quarantine for 14 days, there was no suspicion at the time that any of them might have already contracted the virus.\n\nOften, miracle cures and flat Earth theories are dismissed as \u201charmless\u201d amusement or personal quirks rather than disinformation. As \u201cMad Mike\u2019s\u201d failed rocket experiment shows, the stakes can be far higher.", "lang": "en"}
