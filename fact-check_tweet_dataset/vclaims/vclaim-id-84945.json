Trump said he would push for two new laws aimed at punishing criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry and removing \u201ccriminal immigrants and terrorists,\u201d including previously deported unauthorized immigrants. He said he would name these laws after victims killed by people in the United States illegally.\n\nBut Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower immigration, said most of that 1.9 million figure are undocumented, but she did not provide any specific data. She said it was based on information she received from a DHS source she could not reveal, which we can\u2019t independently verify. The Trump campaign consulted Vaughan on the speech and used her calculations for statistics on criminal aliens.\n\nVaughan added an additional 200,000 based on her calculation of the number of people ICE released per prosecutorial discretion guidelines. Most of these encounters were in jails, of people who were arrested and were identified by ICE as a \u201ccriminal threat.\u201d Once ICE decides not to pursue deportation, the local law enforcement would release them from jail. They are not technically classified as the same \u201ccriminal alien\u201d definition by ICE at that point.\n\nImmigrants can pay bond out of ICE custody. They may be lawful residents who are granted some type of relief under the law, or people granted asylum for fleeing persecution, said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California at Davis School of Law. He added: \u201cU.S. authorities may decide not to seek removal of low-level criminal offenders. It is known as prosecutorial discretion. Some minor crimes, for example, might not warrant destroying families.\u201d\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s proposal, a person arrested by police \u2014 regardless of how serious the crime is, without knowing whether they are present illegally \u2014 would be held in jail, and their removal proceeding would begin without due process. Such an approach to enforcement is consistent with Trump\u2019s call to bring back two DHS enforcement programs that rely on local governments, which are being phased out because they didn\u2019t effectively target violent criminals, and opened up the potential of racial profiling.\n\nTrump used fuzzy math to back up his proposal to remove criminals who are in the country illegally. The 2 million figure refers to the total number of \u201cremovable criminal aliens\u201d as determined by DHS, and refers to convicted non-citizens in the country legally and illegally. While he states it as fact, an independent think tank analyzing immigration policy estimated that more than half of the 2 million are convicted criminals who are not U.S. citizens, but lawfully in the country.\n\nTrump\u2019s other figure is a complex calculation by the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration. In general, figures provided by organizations with a goal to change policy should be viewed with skepticism. The number that directly fits the ICE definition of \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d released into the community is 82,228 \u2013 about 27 percent of Trump\u2019s figure \u2014 that the agency reported to Congress. Of that figure, 56 percent were released based on ICE\u2019s discretion, or \u201cbeing politically correct,\u201d as Trump would say. The rest adding up to 300,000 includes a variety of calculations, including those considered a \u201ccriminal threat,\u201d not necessarily \u201ccriminal aliens.\u201d\n\nFederal immigration enforcement data, especially relating to illegal immigration, are not always transparent or reliable. That leads to outside groups recalculating federal data to make their point \u2014 which then gets elevated when a prominent person is willing to cite it in a major speech, such as Trump\u2019s immigration address in Phoenix. Trump states both figures as simple fact, when both calculations are much more complex than that.", "lang": "en"}
