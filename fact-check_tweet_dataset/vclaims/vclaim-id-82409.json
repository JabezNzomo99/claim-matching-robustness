Trump urged voters who cast mail-in ballots to also go to polling places and attempt to vote again on Election Day to \u201cmake sure\u201d that their ballot was counted.\n\nThe president\u2019s comments resulted in not just confusion, but widespread speculation that the President of the United States had just urged voters to commit a crime. Although Trump did suggest that people who vote by mail may need to again vote in person, his stated purpose was to ensure their ballot is counted, not elicit from them a double vote.\n\nTrump\u2019s statements were both incorrect and potentially harmful to voters, as we will explain below. But first let\u2019s review his exact statement.\n\nSpeaking while visiting North Carolina, Trump stated the following.\n\nOn your ballots, if you get the unsolicited ballots, send it in and then go make sure it counted, and then if it doesn\u2019t tabulate, you vote. You just vote. And then if they tabulate it very late, which they shouldn\u2019t be doing, they\u2019ll see you voted and so it won\u2019t count. So, send it in early, and then go and vote. And if it\u2019s not tabulated, you vote, and the vote is gonna count. You can\u2019t let them take your vote away. These people are playing dirty politics. Dirty politics. So if you have an absentee ballot, or as I call it a solicited ballot, you send it in. But I would check it in any event. I would go and follow it and go vote. And everybody here wants to vote. We vote the old fashioned way. You know, we voted in World War I, we voted in World War II, we\u2019re gonna see some great World War II heroes right now. But we voted in World War II. And today they want to give everybody ballots. And every place where they\u2019ve done it, it\u2019s been a mess. It\u2019s been a mess. They don\u2019t know where they are. They don\u2019t know who they\u2019re sending them to, it\u2019s a terrible thing. Follow your ballot and vote. That\u2019s very important, I think everybody understands.\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks are captured in this video clip:\n\nAfter making this statement, Trump followed up with tweets that urged voters to do the same thing on a national scale, prompting Twitter to slap the tweets with warning labels indicating that they violated the platform\u2019s election integrity policy.\n\nVoting by mail will play a significant role in the Nov. 3, 2020, general election due to safety precautions amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Trump has been making comments suggesting mail-in ballots make elections less secure by causing widespread fraud \u2014 doubts that are not grounded in fact.\n\nThe North Carolina State Board of Elections issued a statement on Sept. 3, 2020, warning voters that voting twice \u201cwith intent to commit a fraud to register or vote at more than one precinct or more than one time\u201d is a felony, and that going to a polling place after already casting a mail-in ballot will only increase risk of COVID-19 transmission.\n\n\u201cAttempting to vote twice in an election or soliciting someone to do so also is a violation of North Carolina law,\u201d reads the statement issued by Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections.\n\nBrinson Bell stated that North Carolina has numerous safeguards in place to prevent double voting and urged people to sign up for BallotTrax, set to launch soon, which will allow voters to track their vote through the mail and confirm that it was received by their county\u2019s election officials.\n\n\u201cThe State Board office strongly discourages people from showing up at the polls on Election Day to check whether their absentee ballot was counted,\u201d Brinson Bell said in the statement. \u201cThat is not necessary, and it would lead to longer lines and the possibility of spreading COVID-19.\u201d\n\nWe asked the state board of elections about Trump\u2019s distinction between \u201csolicited\u201d and \u201cunsolicited\u201d mail-in ballots and were told that none of the state\u2019s voters are receiving \u201cunsolicited\u201d mail-in ballots.\n\nWhile some advocacy groups and political parties have sent absentee ballot request forms to voters, North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesman Patrick Gannon told us in an email, \u201cNo one is receiving an absentee by-mail ballot who did not request one through the proper process.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s mention of \u201cunsolicited ballots\u201d is likely a reference to universal mail-in voting, in which states automatically send registered voters mail-in ballots. This system is only in place in nine states and the District of Columbia. North Carolina is not one of them.", "lang": "en"}
