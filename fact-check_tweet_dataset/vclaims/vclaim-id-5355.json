U.S. intelligence has named only Russia as the culprit.\n\nThe New York Times reported on July 18 that two weeks before his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017, Trump \u201cwas shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Times, \u201cThe evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.\u201d\n\nThat same day, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence publicly released a declassified intelligence report that said: \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,\u201d and the goal of the campaign was \u201cto help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances.\u201d\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly questioned the idea that Russia was behind the hacking of the DNC, as we documented in our story \u201cIn His Own Words: Trump on Russian Meddling.\u201d But even after the briefing with intelligence officials on Jan. 6, 2017, he continued to send muddied messages about whether he believed Russians, or Russians alone, were responsible for hacking into the computers of officials at the Democratic National Committee and conducting other activities aimed at tipping the election scales in his favor.\n\nJan. 6, 2017 \u2014 Trump releases a statement about the intelligence briefing that says, in part: \u201cWhile Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\u201d\n\nJan. 11, 2017 \u2014 At a news conference a week before his inauguration, Trump states, \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. And I \u2014 I can say that you know when \u2014 when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China. We had \u2014 we had much hacking going on.\u201d\n\nAll of that was included in the Fox video montage. Trump goes on to criticize the DNC for not adequately defending itself against hacks. He suggests he did not believe the intent of the Russian effort was to help his campaign. \u201cI think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would\u2019ve released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her,\u201d Trump says, referring to Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.\n\nHe also says this: \u201cBut remember this: We talk about the hacking and hacking\u2019s bad and it shouldn\u2019t be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.\u201d\n\nAsked by a reporter if he accepted the intelligence report conclusion that Putin ordered the campaign because he wanted to help Trump, the president replies, \u201cWell, if \u2014 if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia.\u201d\n\nApril 29, 2017 \u2014 Trump tells CBS News\u2019 John Dickerson, \u201c[K]nowing something about hacking, if you don\u2019t catch a hacker, okay, in the act, it\u2019s very hard to say who did the hacking. With that being said, I\u2019ll go along with Russia. Could\u2019ve been China, could\u2019ve been a lot of different groups.\u201d\n\nJuly 6, 2017 \u2014 At a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw, Trump states at various points, \u201cWell, I think it was Russia, and I think it could have been other people in other countries. It could have been a lot of people interfered \u2026 I think it was Russia, but I think it was probably other people and/or countries \u2026 It was Russia, and I think it was others also.\u201d Those comments were included in the Fox News montage Trump highlighted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it very simply. I think it could very well have been Russia,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI think it could well have been other countries. And I won\u2019t be specific. But I think a lot of people interfere. I think it\u2019s been happening for a long time. It\u2019s been happening for many, many years.\u201d\n\nIn the press conference, a reporter says, \u201cYou again state you think it was Russia. Your intelligence agencies have been far more definitive. They say it was Russia. Why won\u2019t you agree and say it was?\u201d\n\nTrump responds, in part, \u201cI agree, I think it was Russia, but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure. I remember when I was sitting back listening about Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction. How everybody was 100 percent sure that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Guess what \u2014 that led to one big mess. They were wrong and it led to a mess.\u201d\n\nJuly 12, 2017 \u2014 In an interview with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump is asked about broaching the issue with Putin during the G20 summit. \u201cAnd I said to him, \u2018Were you involved with the meddling in the election?\u2019 He said, \u2018Absolutely not. I was not involved.\u2019 He was very strong on it,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI then said to him again, in a totally different way, \u2018Were you involved with the meddling?\u2019 He said, I was not \u2014 absolutely not. \u2026 Somebody said later to me, which was interesting. Said, let me tell you, if they were involved, you wouldn\u2019t have found out about it. Okay, which is a very interesting point.\u201d\n\nNov. 11, 2017 \u2014 In a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, Trump is asked if he brought up the issue with Putin. Trump responds, \u201cHe just \u2014 every time he sees me, he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that.\u2019 And I believe \u2014 I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. But he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that.\u2019 I think he\u2019s very insulted by it, if you want to know the truth. Don\u2019t forget, all he said is he never did that, he didn\u2019t do that. I think he\u2019s very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he believed Putin, Trump says, \u201cI think that he is very, very strong in the fact that he didn\u2019t do it. And then you look, and you look at what\u2019s going on with Podesta, and you look at what\u2019s going on with the server from the DNC and why didn\u2019t the FBI take it, why did they leave it; why did a third party look at the server and not the FBI \u2014 if you look at all of this stuff, and you say, what\u2019s going on here? And then you hear it\u2019s 17 agencies. Well, it\u2019s three. And one is Brennan and one is whatever. I mean, give me a break. They\u2019re political hacks. So you look at it \u2014 I mean, you have Brennan, you have Clapper, and you have Comey. Comey is proven now to be a liar and he\u2019s proven to be a leaker. So you look at that, and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that. Now, you\u2019re not going to get into an argument. You\u2019re going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference in Vietnam that same day, Trump is asked about his comment about Putin\u2019s denials and if he believes Putin and/or Russia interfered in the election. Trump says, \u201cWhat I said there, I\u2019m surprised that there\u2019s any conflict on this. What I said there is that I believe he believes that, and that\u2019s very important for somebody to believe. I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election. As to whether I believe it or not, I\u2019m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership. I believe in our intel agencies, our intelligence agencies.\u201d\n\nMarch 6, 2018 \u2014 In a press conference Trump states, \u201cWell, the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever. But, certainly, there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals.\u201d\n\nThat was another comment included in the Fox montage. As we wrote when Trump said something similar on July 6, 2017 \u2014 that the computer hacking \u201ccould have been other people and other countries\u201d \u2014 there is no evidence for that, and U.S. intelligence has named only Russia as the culprit.\n\nMay 27, 2018 \u2014 Trump sends out a tweet referring to \u201cthe so-called Russian Meddling.\u201d\n\nJune 28, 2018 \u2014 Trump tweets, \u201cRussia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn\u2019t Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn\u2019t Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption!\u201d\n\nJuly 16, 2018 \u2014During a joint press conference with Putin in Helsinki, Trump says Putin denied involvement in an influence campaign. A reporter pointedly asks Trump whether he believes U.S. intelligence agencies or Putin.\n\nTrump begins his response by questioning why the DNC failed to turn over its servers to FBI investigators (though the former FBI director testified last year that it did not hurt the investigation, which on July 13 resulted in an indictment against 12 Russian military intelligence agents).\n\n\u201cMy people came to me, [Director of National Intelligence] Dan Coates came to me and some others, they said they think it\u2019s Russia,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI have President Putin; he just said it\u2019s not Russia. I will say this: I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server.\u201d Trump adds, \u201cI have confidence in both parties.\u201d\n\nTrump also says, \u201cI have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.\u201d\n\nJuly 17, 2018 \u2014 The day after his press conference with Putin, in a meeting with members of Congress, Trump says he meant to say, \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t be Russia.\u201d Trump adds that he has \u201cfull faith and support for America\u2019s great intelligence agencies\u201d and that, \u201cI have felt very strongly that, while Russia\u2019s actions had no impact at all on the outcome of the election, let me be totally clear in saying that \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this many times \u2014 I accept our intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election took place. Could be other people also; there\u2019s a lot of people out there.\u201d\n\nJuly 22, 2018 \u2014 Just a few days after thanking Fox News for showing clips he says demonstrate he has recognized Russian meddling many times, Trump tweets that the investigation is \u201call a big hoax.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference on July 23, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump\u2019s \u201choax\u201d comment was \u201creferencing the collusion component,\u201d not the Russia investigation in general. Said Sanders: \u201cAs the President has said many times, and stated over and over again \u2014 as have I, as have a number of other administration officials \u2014 we maintain that Russia interfered in the elections. The President, however, very much so, and has repeatedly \u2014 as, again, have the rest of us \u2014 that his campaign colluding in that process is a total hoax.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
