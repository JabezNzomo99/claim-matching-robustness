Here's why.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-3947", "url": "https://fullfact.org/health/why-government-accusing-bma-lying/", "vclaim": "Why is the government accusing the BMA of lying?\n\nThere are two fights here. One is about a pay calculator the BMA released last summer, which according to the government is the source of suggestions that some doctors would get a 30% pay cut. The other is about whether it was fair back then to say the government intended to cut pay at all.\n\nAlthough pay for evenings and Saturdays has been described as the \u2018substantive\u2019 area of dispute between the BMA and the government at this stage, there\u2019s also been significant disagreement over the contract\u2019s effects on working hours.\n\nThe BMA\u2019s pay calculator got it wrong on recommended pay, according to the government\n\nThe Department of Health told us the best example of misleading information on pay was the \u2018ready reckoner\u2019 pay calculator released by the BMA over the summer.\n\nAt the time NHS Employers, the body behind the pay recommendations the calculator was based on, said it was one of a few that had issues:\n\n\u201cMost calculators that we have seen are underestimating what junior doctor earnings would be, either through errors, or because they are not including all aspects of pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, most do not include the on call availability supplement\u2026 which could be a significant amount, or include any flexible pay premia, which could further boost some junior doctors earnings. It is inevitable that pay calculators will show a trend towards reduction in pay if they compare 100 per cent of current earnings against less than 100 per cent of new earnings.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly which of these problems applied to the BMA\u2019s calculator specifically, or the 30% figure. The full statement doesn\u2019t seem to be available online any more so we\u2019ve asked NHS Employers for a copy of it.\n\nThe calculator was later taken down by the BMA. We\u2019ve asked it for a response to the government\u2019s allegation that the calculator was inaccurate, and that doctors were misled on their pay as a result. We haven\u2019t had a response at the time of writing.\n\nPutting the specific 30% figure to one side, whether the BMA was right to say that some level of pay cut was coming down the line depends on divining the government\u2019s intentions.\n\nIn July the body tasked with reviewing proposed contracts recommended that \u2018scenarios\u2019 in which pay would fall for some doctors be used \u201cas the basis for further discussion/negotiation between the parties\u201d.\n\nIn August, the BMA said it wouldn\u2019t negotiate on the recommendations because they represented a worse offer for doctors than when it had walked away from talks the previous October.\n\nThe government had already said that if the BMA wasn\u2019t prepared to negotiate, it was ready to impose a contract.\n\nThe question is whether this meant it was determined to impose the recommendations more or less intact, which would entail a pay cut for some doctors, or whether at this point it was prepared to change the parts of the contract to protect pay.\n\nThe government says that the option of pay protection was always on the table.\n\nWhen he first announced the contract would contain pay protection in October, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said:\n\n\u201cI made it clear to the BMA at the beginning of September that that was a possible outcome of negotiations, in an attempt to encourage it to return to the negotiating table. Rather than negotiating, it chose to wind up its own members and create a huge amount of unnecessary anger.\u201d\n\nThe BMA felt differently about where the pay protection proposal had come from, saying \u201cit has taken the threat of industrial action and the sight of thousands of junior doctors taking to the streets to reach this point.\u201d\n\nPay protection eventually appeared in a formal contract proposal made by NHS Employers at the start of November. This itself has been controversial\u2014there are more details of the current state of play for junior doctors\u2019 pay in our longer guide to the issue.", "lang": "en"}
