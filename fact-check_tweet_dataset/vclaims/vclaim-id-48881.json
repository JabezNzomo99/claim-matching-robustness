This is not correct. Government guidance is clear that you can only meet with one person outside of your household at a time. This must be outdoors and maintaining social distancing, and only applies in England.\n\nIn an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on 11 May, Mr Raab was asked if you can now meet with two parents at the same time. He responded: \u201cWell, you could if they\u2019re two metres apart.\u201d\n\nHowever, the new government guidance\u2014which applies only to England and comes into force on 13 May\u2014is clear that you can only meet with one person from another household at a time. This should happen in an outdoor space like a park, rather than in a home, and you should stay two metres away from them at all times.\n\nGatherings of more than two people from different households are against the law, apart from in specific cases such work, funerals, house moves and supporting the vulnerable.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cabinet Office confirmed to Full Fact that the government guidance and its specific instructions about meeting no more than one person outside of your household at a time is the correct advice.\n\nThe Independent has also reported that a government source confirmed people \u201ccan see both parents but not at the same time\u2014they would have to see them individually.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve also asked Foreign Office for comment on Mr Raab\u2019s statement.\n\nThe new guidance also outlines a number of other changes, which will come into force on 13 May. These include allowing the following:\n\u2022 Spending time outdoors for things other than exercise, including sunbathing and picnicking\n\u2022 Exercising outdoors as much as you like, as long as you follow social distancing guidelines\n\u2022 Using outdoor sports facilities including tennis or basketball courts or golf courses, with members of your household or one other person while staying two metres apart\n\u2022 Travelling any distance to reach an outdoor space\n\nAlso, while not compulsory, people are now advised to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is not possible such as on public transport or in shops\n\nHowever, restrictions on visiting people in their homes, visiting second homes, using playgrounds or indoor sports courts and visiting private or ticketed attractions are still in place. The government is still urging people to stay home as much as possible.", "lang": "en"}
