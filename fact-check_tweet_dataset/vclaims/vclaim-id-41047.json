In the video, Adams claims that \u201cvaccines [have been] found laced with entire genetic code for abnormal human loaded with cancer genes\u201d. This claim has also been propagated by outlets such as InfoWars and Children\u2019s Health Defense.\n\nScientists who reviewed this video found the claim to be inaccurate. They highlighted that the study cited by Adams, which originates from an Italian group named Corvelva known for its anti-vaccine stance, has never been published in a reputable scientific journal. The report lacks even the most basic details of how it was conducted\u2014such as the origin of the samples used for sequencing, the steps taken to isolate DNA for sequencing, the method of DNA sequencing, the raw sequencing data, and the way the data was analysed. In scientific publications, these details are normally documented in the Materials and Methods section and are important for allowing other researchers to replicate the experiments independently. In short, Corvelva\u2019s report is incomplete and therefore lacks credibility.\n\nAdams claims that \u201c560 genes linked to cancer\u201d have been found, but does not cite any study or data to support this. He also talks about how vaccines lead to \u201cgenetic imprinting\u201d in children through vaccines. This is a misnomer\u2014Adams appears to be referring to genomic imprinting, a phenomenon in which only one parent\u2019s genes are expressed. People cannot be \u201cimprinted\u201d through vaccines, because the cellular machinery for gene expression is located only inside of cells, therefore free-floating DNA outside of cells cannot be expressed. While external DNA can be introduced into cells, this only occurs in highly specific, laboratory-controlled conditions (during a process called transfection) that do not occur in a living person.\n\nPeople are exposed to much higher levels of foreign cells and DNA through other means, such as the bacteria and fungi that surround us every day and through sexual contact. Another example is organ and tissue transplantation, during which organ recipients receive large amounts of foreign DNA and intact cells from the donor.\n\nDr. Paul Offit also clarified this point in an ABC News report, explaining that \u201cthere are perhaps nanograms of DNA fragments still found in the vaccine, perhaps billionths of a gram [\u2026] You would find as much if you analyzed the fruits and vegetables you eat.\u201d\n\nAdams contradicts himself on numerous occasions in the video. At several points, he talks about how the use of aborted fetal tissue in vaccine manufacturing \u201cis openly listed by the CDC and the FDA and the vaccine manufacturers\u201d. This is true\u2014such information can be found in vaccine product inserts. Yet he also talks about how this information is \u201ccensored\u201d, which is not true\u2014USA Today and ABC News covered this in 2015 and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia also discusses this topic.\n\n\n\n Ang\u00e9line Rouers, Research Fellow, Singapore Immunology Network:\n\n Many things are wrong with this claim.\n\n1. \u201cVaccines [have been] found\u201d: this is not based on a scientific publication published in a recognized scientific journal. It is important to remember that scientific publications need to be peer-reviewed and clearly detail the materials and methods used. All the statements here in the video are based on a purported study led by the Italian organization Corvelva, which is not a scientific institution but an association that takes a clear position against vaccines. The company running the sequencing work is also, mysteriously, not named: \u201cthe work has been carried out by a company in the USA, that routinely deals with human genome re-sequencing analysis\u201d [this quote can be found in an archived version of Corvelva\u2019s report].\n\n2. \u201centire genetic code\u201d: It is unlikely that we can find the entire human genetic code in the final vaccine product since FDA allows only a very limited presence of small DNA fragments in a vaccine. Based on the report from the World Health Organization (WHO), this limit is set at 10 nanograms (ng) per dose. The PRIORIX vaccine mentioned in the video strictly follows this regulation [PRIORIX is a vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella]. The WHO also reports that the viral inactivating agent used to prepare vaccines may also destroy the biological activity of these small DNA fragments [this is explained in page 7 of the WHO report]. This provides an additional level of confidence that small DNA contaminants in a vaccine are safe.\n\n3. \u201cloaded with cancer genes\u201d: Corvelva\u2019s study reports insertion and deletion in the DNA found in the vaccine. But there is no reason to conclude about the presence of cancer genes. The article jumps too fast to the conclusion and try to convince the reader about the statement with a funny justification: \u201cThere is no need to be a scientist to understand from the Circos, simply at a glance, that the vaccine genome is not a genome that can be defined as normal\u201d. Sorry, I am a scientist and I don\u2019t believe we can do this conclusion from the Circos presented [a Circos plot is commonly used to represent genomic data]. Again, there is a lack of transparency about the method and the data used in the purported study.\n\nGoing back to the video itself and its content, I think it is also important to clarify two other things:\n\u2022 There is complete misinformation in Adams\u2019 statement: \u201cthey take cells from an aborted baby and clone them to put in a vaccine\u201d. There are no cells from the aborted fetus injected with the vaccine. The cells are used to produce the vaccine and small DNA contaminants of this cells can be found. But not the entire cells!\n\u2022 The video suggests that vaccines, by their DNA content, also transmit propensity for murder and mental illness from the mother who aborted. NO. Important to remember that murder and mental illness are not coded into DNA.\n\nTeja Celhar, Research Scientist, Singapore Immunology Network:\n\n In this video, Mike Adams claims that an \u201corganization out of Italy has completed the genome sequencing of some of the proteins found in common vaccines\u201d. There are two major concerns about this claim:\n\u2022 Genome sequencing cannot be performed on proteins, it can only be done on DNA samples.\n\u2022 There is no information from the organization \u201cout of Italy\u201d on how they collected the samples, which vaccines they have tested, the results of the genome sequencing data, and how they have concluded that the genes are derived from cancer cells. No scientific study could be published without this basic information. Without these data being peer-reviewed and replicated by other researchers, Mike Adams cannot claim that all of this \u201chas been confirmed\u201d.\n\nThe claim that the \u201cestablishment\u201d tried to censor \u201ceverybody\u201d about the fact that vaccines are being produced in fetal-derived cells is untrue, as the process has been always transparent and known since the 1970\u2019s (see this previous review by Health Feedback). Viruses cannot replicate by themselves, so in order to make a vaccine (with an attenuated or dead virus), a host cell has to be used, preferably a human-derived cell.\n\nThe most common fetal-derived cells used in vaccine production were each derived from a single elective abortion: the WI-38 cell strain was developed in 1962 in the United States, and the MRC-5 cell strain was developed in 1970 at the Medical Research Center in the United Kingdom. Both cell strains were extensively studied and they are regarded as safe, as they have been derived from normal fetuses, have a stable karyotype and do not cause tumors when injected in experimental animals (again, see this earlier review for references).\n\nMike Adams claims that the genomic analysis revealed genetic abnormalities in these cells, but provides no reference or data to support it. He mentions \u201c560 genes linked to cancer\u201d, but provides no information on what these genes are and how they are linked to cancer. Additionally, these cells are not a part of the vaccine as Mike Adams claims, but just the \u201cvessels\u201d in which the virus, the main component of the vaccine, is being produced. As the purification of the viruses after production is not a 100% successful process, there will always be some residual molecules from the cells (in which the viruses have been produced) in the final vaccine formulation. The producers (i.e. pharmaceutical companies) have always been transparent about it.\n\nThe claim that this information has been censored is simply untrue, as the cell lines and other molecules used in vaccine production are publicly available. Mike Adams even states himself that you can find FDA \u201cadmissions\u201d about the vaccine composition \u2013 except that these are not so much \u201cadmissions\u201d as simply summaries of molecules that can be found as residuals in the vaccines, as the pharmaceutical companies are required by law to list them.\n\nMike Adams claims that they \u201chave taken aborted fetal tissue cells from an aborted baby and they\u2019ve cloned them and they\u2019ve put them in the vaccine\u201d \u2013 this claim demonstrates his misunderstanding of vaccine production. Again, these cells were \u201cnot put in the vaccine\u201d, but used to replicate the viruses which are the main component of the vaccine and the residual DNA in the vaccine formulation is minimal. Humans are exposed to genomic DNA from viruses, bacteria and ingested food on a daily basis and pregnant mothers are exposed to fetal DNA for 9 months during gestation \u2013 the residual DNA present in vaccines is negligible by comparison.\n\nWe previously reviewed an open letter by Dr. Theresa Deisher claiming that fetal DNA in vaccines cause autoimmunity and autism \u2013 scientists found it to be of low scientific credibility.", "lang": "en"}
