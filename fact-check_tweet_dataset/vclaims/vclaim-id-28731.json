But she went too far in a couple of instances when discussing the impact of Wisconsin and Georgia laws in the 2016 election, when she ran for president:\n\u2022 Clinton said the \u201cbest studies\u201d show that \u201csomewhere between 40[000] and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls\u201d in Wisconsin because of the state\u2019s voter ID law. Her office provided us with reports that did not support the figures she cited, and we could find no credible statewide estimate.\n\u2022 Clinton falsely claimed that \u201cthere were fewer voters registered in Georgia [in 2016] than then there had been those prior four years\u201d in 2012. In fact, there were nearly 571,000 more registered voters in the 2016 election, state records show.\n\nThe former Democratic presidential nominee made her remarks on March 3 at the annual \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d commemorative service, which was held at the Brown Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Selma, Alabama.\n\nIn 2016, Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin, but lost the Electoral College vote and the presidency to Donald Trump. She lost the popular vote by a combined 77,744 votes in three Rust-Belt states that President Barack Obama had won in 2008 and 2012 \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 costing her 46 electoral votes and the election.\n\nDuring her remarks in Selma, Clinton spoke about the impact of a 2013 Supreme Court decision that overturned a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. In part, the court ruled that it was unconstitutional to require some states to get federal approval of state laws that could disproportionately affect minority voters. Nine states, including Georgia, and parts of six others were subject to the so-called preclearance requirement at the time of the court ruling, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nClinton spoke about the impact that restrictive state voting laws had on voter registration and turnout in Wisconsin and Georgia in 2016.\n\nHere\u2019s what she said about Wisconsin, which was not subject to the Voting Rights Act\u2019s preclearance requirement.\n\nWe asked Clinton\u2019s spokesman, Nick Merrill, for the studies that Clinton referenced in her remarks. But what he provided did not support her claim that \u201cbetween 40[000] and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls\u201d in Wisconsin because of the state\u2019s voter ID law.\n\nMerrill referred us to a Mother Jones story about a study done by the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where researchers surveyed nonvoters to estimate how many of them were deterred from voting by the voter ID law. But that study was limited to two counties, Milwaukee and Dane, and warned against using the study to extrapolate a statewide estimate.\n\nThe center mailed surveys to 2,400 people in Milwaukee and Dane counties who were registered and eligible to vote, but did not vote. A total of 293 nonvoters returned the survey. Based on those results, the center estimated that 11.2 percent, or 16,801, of eligible voters were deterred by the voter ID law. (The actual number could have been higher. The estimated number of deterred voters ranged from 11,701, or 7.8 percent, to 23,252, or 15.5 percent, the authors explain in a supporting document.)\n\nThe researchers pointedly and repeatedly said their work could not be used to derive a statewide estimate.\n\n\u201cThe 11.2% figure cannot be directly extrapolated statewide, because we do not know how people outside of Dane or Milwaukee Counties would have answered the questions about their reasons for nonvoting or whether or not they possess a qualifying form of photo ID,\u201d the study said. \u201cThe statewide totals outside of Dane and Milwaukee are certain to be greater than zero, but we cannot assume that the effect was the same, 11.2%.\u201d\n\nAt another point, the study said: \u201cThese counties contain the two largest metro areas in the state (Milwaukee and Madison) and have the largest low-income and minority populations, which research has shown are most likely to be affected by voter ID requirements. For this reason, the estimates cannot be extrapolated to the state of Wisconsin as a whole.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Mother Jones attributed a statewide estimate of 45,000 voters to the lead author on the study, University of Wisconsin-Madison political science Professor Kenneth R. Mayer.\n\n\u201cExtrapolating statewide, he says the data suggests as many as 45,000 voters sat out the election, though he cautioned that it was difficult to produce an estimate from just two counties,\u201d the Mother Jones story said of Mayer.\n\nWe sent three emails to Mayer and called his office over the course of three days, but he did not respond to our questions about his report or the Mother Jones article. However, he did tell the Washington Post Fact Checker that he was misinterpreted by the magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s not a claim that I made,\u201d Mayer told the Post.\n\nAs for the 80,000 estimate, Clinton\u2019s office referred us to an analysis of the 2016 presidential election results by the Tides Foundation and the Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society. Merrill, Clinton\u2019s spokesman, sent us an excerpt from the report about the decline in black turnout, and highlighted a sentence that mentions Wisconsin (in bold below).\n\nBut, as the excerpt above shows, the report did not give a reason why about 80,000 fewer black voters cast ballots in Wisconsin in 2016 compared with 2012. \u201cIt is difficult, however, to assess how much of this drop is due to the states\u2019 new laws versus lack of enthusiasm for the candidates,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report also noted that there was a large number of voters, including those in Wisconsin, who cast ballots for third-party candidates. \u201cIn Wisconsin, where Trump\u2019s margin was +0.8 points, \u2018third party\u2019 and write-in candidates garnered 5.56 percent of votes for president,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn its conclusion, the report said: \u201cDepressed turnout rates \u2014 and quite possibly voter suppression \u2014 across several Democratic-leaning groups contributed enormously to Clinton\u2019s defeat.\u201d However, it also said: \u201cThose who wish to assign blame can \u2014 and do \u2014 debate whether the brunt should be placed on Obama voters who swung to Trump, Romney voters who didn\u2019t swing to Clinton, or those who voted for neither major-party candidate. But a clear-eyed assessment must acknowledge that no one of these alone can be deemed the reason for the election\u2019s outcome.\u201d\n\nLastly, Clinton\u2019s office cited a partisan analysis published by a Democratic-aligned super PAC, Priorities USA, that said Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law prevented as many as 200,000 voters from voting.\n\n\u201cWhile states with no change to voter identification laws witnessed an average increased turnout of +1.3% from 2012 to 2016, Wisconsin\u2019s turnout (where voter ID laws changed to strict) dropped by -3.3%,\u201d the Priorities USA report said. \u201cIf turnout had instead increased by the national-no-change average, we estimate that over 200,000 more voters would have voted in Wisconsin in 2016. For context, Clinton lost to Trump in Wisconsin by only 20,000 votes.\u201d\n\nBut the Priorities USA report implies a causation that it cannot prove without conducting the research.\n\nThere is no doubt that the voter ID law deterred thousands of registered Wisconsin voters from casting ballots in the 2016 election. The University of Wisconsin-Madison study shows that. But we could find no credible statewide estimate that supports Clinton\u2019s claim that \u201cbetween 40[000] and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls\u201d in Wisconsin in 2016.\n\n\u201cThere is much debate about the numbers of voters who were deterred from voting in 2016, but no matter what study you\u2019re looking at, even the most conservative efforts were enough to change the outcome in more than one key state,\u201d Merrill said in an email to FactCheck.org. \u201cVoter suppression is getting worse not better, and fighting for that basic right is critical going forward.\u201d\n\nUpdated, March 7: We updated this story to include the above statement from Clinton\u2019s spokesman, Nick Merrill.\n\nClinton also claimed that as a result of a controversial state law in Georgia \u2014 a state that was previously covered by the Voting Rights Act \u2014 there were fewer people registered to vote in 2016 than in 2012.\n\nWe did think about it. We also went to the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s website for registration data, and we found that she was wrong.\n\nThere were 5,443,046 active voters and 1,194,893 inactive voters for a total of 6,637,939 registered voters in Georgia for the November general election in 2016, according to state historical data. That represented an increase of 90,033 active voters and 480,945 inactive voters for a total of 570,978 more total registered voters in 2016 compared with 2012.\n\nJohn Hallman, Georgia\u2019s election systems manager, told us that \u201cinactive voters\u201d are those who haven\u2019t voted or made contact with the Elections Division of the Secretary of State\u2019s office for three years. He said \u201cinactive voters\u201d are eligible to vote and, if they do, they are moved to active status. However, they are in danger of having their names removed from the voter rolls for future elections.\n\nGeorgia has one of the most restrictive state laws when it comes to what Hallman called voter registration \u201cmaintenance.\u201d Critics call it voter suppression.\n\nIn a story on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that upheld the state law, the Atlanta Journal Constitution explained how the state law works: \u201cIn Georgia, registered voters who fail to vote for three years and then don\u2019t respond to a letter from the state are moved to \u2018inactive status.\u2019 Inactive voters can still participate in elections. Voters who remain inactive for two federal election cycles without voting or having any other contact with election officials are removed from voter rolls.\u201d\n\nHallman said it usually takes five years to move an inactive voter to what he called \u201ccancelled status.\u201d But, he said, that didn\u2019t happen in 2016, when there were 1,194,893 inactive voters \u2014 far more than the 713,948 inactive voters in 2012. He said the state ran out of time before it could complete the \u201cmaintenance\u201d process in 2016.\n\nFor purposes of calculating voter participation, the state uses \u201cactive voters\u201d as the baseline. But it doesn\u2019t matter which designation we use to look at registered voters: The numbers of both active and inactive voters went up in 2016.\n\nClinton was wrong when she said \u201cthere were fewer voters registered in Georgia [in 2016] than then there had been those prior four years\u201d in 2012.", "lang": "en"}
