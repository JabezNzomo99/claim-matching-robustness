As we have previously documented, there is no evidence that that is the case. Vice President Pence, interviewed at The Washington Post, cited the Honduran president in claiming that Venezuela was financing the migrants. There is no evidence that that is the case, either. The Daily Beast reported that the caravan started because a pro-government news channel erroneously reported that a former politician would pay for food and transportation. Trump later acknowledged that he had \u201cno proof\u201d of Middle Easterners being among those migrants but said there \u201cvery well could be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, your 401(k)s? Boom, they will go down like a sinking something. What sinks rapidly? Give me \u2014 a rock. They will go down like a rock. Democrats want to massively raise your taxes, impose socialism on our country. We\u2019ll be another Venezuela. They want to take away your health care, destroy your Second Amendment, and I think the people in Nevada are not big on having your Second Amendment taken away.\u201d\n\nThe president says Democrats will turn the entire country into a \u201csanctuary\u201d for MS-13 gang members (no), that they want to abolish borders (no) and want no controls on illicit drugs and gangs (no). He frequently brings up Venezuela, an increasingly failed state after years of dictatorship and economic mismanagement, as an example of what Democrats would to do to the United States. He says Democrats want to take away health care, when they have been fighting to preserve the Affordable Care Act, which Trump wanted to repeal. Many Democrats do want to raise taxes on the wealthy \u2014 not middle-income Americans \u2014 and do favor relatively modest gun-control proposals (which probably have little chance of passage). Such subtleties are lost in Trump\u2019s rallies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be putting in a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income families. It\u2019s going to be put in next week, 10 percent tax cut. Kevin Brady is working on it. We\u2019ve been working on it for a few months, a 10 percent brand-new \u2014 and that is in addition to the big tax cuts that you\u2019ve already gotten. But this one is for middle income. This is \u2014 no business. Business is now good. They\u2019re coming back. The jobs are coming back. The plants and factories are coming back like never before. They\u2019re all coming back. This is for middle-income people, all middle-income people, a big tax, 10 percent. We\u2019ll be putting it in next week.\u201d\n\nTaking lawmakers and the White House by surprise, Trump claimed that a bill to provide a 10 percent tax cut for \u201cmiddle-income families\u201d was drafted and ready for a vote \u201cnext week.\u201d One problem: Congress is out of session. Another problem: The House and the Senate have not passed a budget resolution for the fiscal year that would accommodate a tax cut. Another problem: There was no such bill. Brady put out a statement saying he would \u201ccontinue\u201d to work on such a bill \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d Trump\u2019s promise of a new tax cut for middle-income people was a tacit admission that the GOP tax bill had lost the messaging war.", "lang": "en"}
