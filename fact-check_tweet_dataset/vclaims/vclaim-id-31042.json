The video is being shared with the claim that it shows the latest situation in Kashmir. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nThe person narrating about the incident in the video says that \u2018the visuals show the JBT teachers being dragged at Karnal\u2019. When searched with keywords, the search results were obtained about the Junior Basic Training (JBT) teachers protest in Haryana. Also, \u2018Karnal\u2019 was found to be a place in Haryana. At the -0:25 seconds in the video, a minibus can be seen with the text (in Hindi) \u2018Haryana Police Karnal\u2019 on it. So, clearly the video is from the state of Haryana and not Jammu & Kashmir as claimed in the post.\n\nFrom the \u2018Tribune\u2019 article dated 6 June 2017, it was found that JBT teachers of Haryana state have gone on strike fearing loss of their jobs due to the revised merit list, issued on the directions of Punjab and Haryana High Court.\n\nIt can also be noted that the post was a live video made on Facebook. So the person could have played this old video on his device and recorded the same through Facebook live.\n\nTo conclude, an old video of a protest by JBT teachers in Haryana is being falsely shared as the latest live video of Kashmir.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
