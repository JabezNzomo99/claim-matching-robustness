And in the 2014 State of the Union address. And yet he keeps using it, as do many other Democrats. So now it\u2019s time for a reassessment.\n\nBut the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the gap is 19 cents when looking at weekly wages. The gap is even smaller when you look at hourly wages \u2014 it is 14 cents \u2014 but then not every wage earner is paid on an hourly basis, so that statistic excludes salaried workers.\n\nIt is worth noting that the gap can go in the other direction as well. Heidi Hartman, president of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, noted that the gap widens to 27.6 cents if part-time workers were included. She also said that in a 2004 survey, IWPR calculated that across 15 years, prime age women earned just 38 percent of what prime age men earned\u2013an apparent wage gap of 62 percent.\n\nSince women in general work fewer hours than men in a year, the statistics used by the White House may be less reliable for examining the key focus of the proposed Paycheck Fairness Act \u2014 wage discrimination. For instance, annual wage figures do not take into account the fact that teachers \u2014 many of whom are women \u2014 have a primary job that fills nine months out of the year. The weekly wage is more of an apples-to-apples comparison, but it does not include as many income categories.\n\nJune O\u2019Neill, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who has been a critic of the 77-cent statistic, has noted that the wage gap is affected by a number of factors, including that the average woman has less work experience than the average man and that more of the weeks worked by women are part-time rather than full-time. Women also tend to leave the work force for periods in order to raise children, seek jobs that may have more flexible hours but lower pay and choose careers that tend to have lower pay.\n\nIn 2011, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis surveyed economic literature and concluded that \u201cresearch suggests that the actual gender wage gap (when female workers are compared with male workers who have similar characteristics) is much lower than the raw wage gap.\u201d They noted that women may prefer to accept jobs with lower wages but greater benefits (more flexible parental leave) so excluding such fringe benefits from the calculations will exaggerate the wage disparity. They also cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department during the George W. Bush administration, which concluded that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap dwindled, to about 5 cents on the dollar.\n\nWe do not want to suggest there is no pay gap. A report by the American Association of University Women found that, after accounting for a variety of factors, including college major and occupation, there was an unexplained seven percent gap one year after graduation. The gap then grew to 12 percent after ten years. But that\u2019s still nearly half the gap touted by the president.\n\nThe White House discovered that broad calculations of wages can yield unsatisfactory results. McClatchy newspapers did the math and reported that when the same standards that generated the 77-cent figure were applied to White House salaries, women overall at the White House make 91 cents for every dollar men make. White House spokesman Jay Carney protested that the review \u201clooked at the aggregate of everyone on staff, and that includes from the most junior levels to the most senior.\u201d But that\u2019s exactly what the Census Department does.\n\nBetsey Stevenson, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged to reporters that the 77-cent figure did not reflect equal pay for equal work. \u201cSeventy-seven cents captures the annual earnings of full-time, full-year women divided by the annual earnings of full-time, full-year men,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that go into that 77-cents figure, there are a lot of things that contribute and no one\u2019s trying to say that it\u2019s all about discrimination, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better figure.\u201d\n\nThere appears to be some sort of wage gap and closing it is certainly a worthy goal. But it\u2019s a bit rich for the president to repeatedly cite this statistic as an \u201cembarrassment.\u201d (His line in the April 8 speech was almost word for word what he said in the 2014 State of the Union address.) The president must begin to acknowledge that \u201c77 cents\u201d does not begin to capture what is actually happening in the work force and society.\n\nThus we are boosting the rating on this factoid to Two Pinocchios. We were tempted to go one step further to Three Pinocchios, but the president is relying on an official government statistic\u2013and there are problems and limitations with the other calculations as well.", "lang": "en"}
