Nicholas Scutari, a primary sponsor of the law, said he\u2019s glad Gov. Chris Christie decided to move forward with the program -- which, he said, is the most restrictive in the country by three measures.\n\n \n\n \"Certainly we're going to be the most restrictive state in the land \u2026 in terms of who can get medical marijuana, how it will be prescribed and how it will be achieved in terms of moving it into the marketplace,\" Scutari (D-Union) said during a July 27 NJToday interview. \n\n \n\n Is New Jersey really the most restrictive in those three categories?\n\n \n\n Most of the experts we spoke with said New Jersey definitely has one of the most -- if not the most -- restrictive medical marijuana programs overall.\n\n \n\n Within Scutari\u2019s three parameters, we found the state senator\u2019s statement sound.\n\n \n\n Washington, D.C., and 16 states have medical marijuana laws. Maryland has a law, but it only allows medicinal marijuana use as a legal defense, so we aren\u2019t considering it. The District of Columbia isn\u2019t a state -- and Scutari said \"most restrictive state.\" So, while we\u2019ll look at Washington, D.C.\u2019s program, it won\u2019t factor into our final ruling.\n\n \n\n We\u2019ll compare New Jersey with other programs by Scutari\u2019s three measures -- who\u2019s eligible to get medical marijuana, how medical marijuana is recommended and how a patient actually gets it.\n\n \n\n We should note that medical marijuana technically can\u2019t be prescribed, but doctors can recommend it for patients.\n\n \n\n Every state describes certain medical conditions or treatments that qualify a patient to receive medical marijuana.\n\n \n\n New Jersey\u2019s list of conditions is consistent with other states in some instances -- but of the 17 laws we are considering, only two -- New Jersey and Washington, D.C. -- don\u2019t have a provision for chronic pain, according to a breakdown of medical marijuana laws by the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, which supports the legalization of marijuana.\n\n \n\n Tamar Todd, a staff attorney for Drug Policy Alliance, a drug policy reform organization, said while \"pain is one of the categories where it is most needed,\" it also is \"the category that allows the most abuse.\"\n\n \n\n The only mention of pain in New Jersey\u2019s law states that a patient with cancer or AIDS or who is HIV positive, qualifies for medical marijuana \"if severe or chronic pain, severe nausea or vomiting, cachexia, or wasting syndrome results from the condition or treatment thereof.\"\n\n \n\n \"[New Jersey\u2019s law] avoids some of the big loopholes that exist in some other states\u2019 laws,\" like California and Colorado, said Jonathan Caulkins, professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n \n\n Between New Jersey and Washington, D.C., the nation\u2019s capital has the more restrictive list of conditions, said Karen O\u2019Keefe, director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, though D.C.\u2019s law also includes some medical treatments that New Jersey does not.\n\n \n\n New Jersey, like most other states and Washington, D.C., allows other medical conditions to be added to the program.\n\n \n\n Now, let\u2019s look at how a doctor can recommend medical marijuana for a patient and how a patient can get medical marijuana.\n\n \n\n New Jersey lists several requirements a physician must meet in order to be eligible to recommend medical marijuana. One example is a provision requiring doctors to register with the state health department. New Jersey\u2019s medical marijuana program is the only one in the country with that mandate, O\u2019Keefe said.\n\n \n\n Once a doctor recommends in writing medical marijuana for someone in New Jersey, the patient or a caregiver must go to one of six dispensaries -- what the state calls \"alternative treatment centers.\" There is no provision allowing patients to grow marijuana at home in New Jersey, and patients can get a maximum amount of two ounces per month. Delaware -- which allows up to six ounces -- and D.C. -- which allows up to two ounces -- are the only other medical marijuana programs that don\u2019t have a grow-at-home provision.\n\n \n\n O\u2019Keefe said, \"If you are talking about restrictive, I think it\u2019s reasonable to say that having dispensaries only is more restrictive,\" because marijuana is being grown in a controlled setting, rather than in private homes.\n\n \n\n The ruling\n\n \n\n Scutari said New Jersey will be the most restrictive state in the nation for medical marijuana because of who can get it, how a doctor can recommend it and how it is distributed.\n\n \n\n Most experts we spoke with agreed New Jersey is one of the most restrictive states for medical marijuana overall. But by Scutari\u2019s three measures, PolitiFact New Jersey found that the Garden State is generally the most restrictive.\n\n \n\n So, we rate Scutari\u2019s statement True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
