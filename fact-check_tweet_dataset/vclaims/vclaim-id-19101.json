However, the handover couldn\u2019t be completed because the Pakistani Army wanted it to be done at some designated exchange points, which were far from Gurez.\n\nAs per the reports, the boy\u2019s body remained in Gurez for two days till Pakistan agreed to a spot on the Churwan border in Gurez. The handover was finally carried out and the child's boy was handed over by the Indian Army to the Pakistan Army at 2 pm, at a point on the Chorwan border.\n\nJournalist Aditya Raj Kaul shared photos from the handover which involved both the Indian as well as the Pakistani Army.", "lang": "en"}
