No, that's not true: The story is a work of satire from a website created by a liberal who trolls conservatives.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by tatersgonnatate.com on December 30, 2019, titled \"Opinion: Trump Should File an Article 2 Motion To Impeach Nancy Pelosi\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nPresident Trump is a master of playing the game politicians have been failing at for decades. There's this little thing in our country called the \"Constitution.\" Unfortunately, most people are pretty unaware of what it says, and that includes our elected officials. A great example is the current impeachment coup. Some folks are stuck on the belief that impeachment is fair and legal just because it's listed as a duty of the House of Representatives. That's not true at all. The process, as laid out in Article 2, says that the Speaker of the House must commit to a fair and legal inquiry otherwise she is in contempt of Congress and subject to impeachment herself.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story is completely fabricated and labeled \"Satire and/or Conservative Fan Fiction\" at the top of the article, next to the byline.\n\nThe column contains two hyperlinks, which offer an amusing perspective on what the author is really thinking. The first link takes readers to a Google Translate entry from English into Russian that says:\n\nThe second link also offers a Russian translation of this:\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair. The Maine resident works with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact-checking website Snopes and has also criticized other fact-checkers who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction, he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an \"About\" page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by other fake news sites that often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer, it is, of course, also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes tatersgonnatate.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
