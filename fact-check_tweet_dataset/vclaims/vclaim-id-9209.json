And there\u2019s the fact that President George W. Bush had signed the agreement and set the date for that withdrawal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massively complex problem,\u201d Clint Watts, the Robert A. Fox fellow in the Foreign Policy Research Institute\u2019s Program on the Middle East, told us. It \u201cgoes beyond one single policy decision about keeping or moving troops.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Trump himself supported withdrawing troops from Iraq as early as 2007, telling CNN in a March 16, 2007, interview that the U.S. should \u201cdeclare victory and leave, because I\u2019ll tell you, this country is just going to get further bogged down. \u2026 [T]his is a total catastrophe and you might as well get out now, because you just are wasting time.\u201d\n\nBut now, in the midst of a campaign to be president, Trump says the withdrawal, without leaving behind a small force, created ISIS. His comments at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, came after he has been linking Clinton to ISIS for weeks.\n\nTrump, Aug. 10: We shouldn\u2019t have ever, ever, ever got into Iraq. I said it from the beginning. I said it from the beginning. \u2026 I said you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East and we did. And then, an even easier decision, we should have never gotten out the way we got out. \u2026 We had a president who decided he\u2019d announce a date and he was going to get out by that date. The problem is the enemy, which really turned out to be ISIS, the enemy was sitting back and actually didn\u2019t believe that this could be happening. \u2026 That they would actually say when they were getting out. So they sat back and they sat back \u2026 but instead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep it under control, and we pulled it out eventually. \u2026 And then we decimated one of the powers and we unleashed fury all over the Middle East. It was a terrible mistake. And then Obama came in and normally you want to clean up, he made a bigger mess out of it. \u2026 And then you had Hillary with Libya. So sad. In fact, in many respects you know they honor President Obama. ISIS is honoring President Obama. He is the founder of ISIS. He\u2019s the founder of ISIS. He\u2019s the founder. He founded ISIS. And I would say the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton, co-founder.\n\nTrump reiterated his \u201cfounder of ISIS\u201d comments in interviews on Aug. 11. When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked him, \u201cYou meant that [Obama] created the vacuum, he lost the peace,\u201d Trump responded: \u201cNo, I meant he\u2019s the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.\u201d Trump added that \u201cthe way he got out of Iraq \u2026 was the founding of ISIS, O.K.?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with a quick fact-check of Trump\u2019s position on the Iraq War: There is no evidence that Trump opposed the war in Iraq before it started on March 19, 2003, despite his frequent claims to the contrary. In fact, Trump expressed mild support in September 2002 for invading Iraq in an interview with radio host Howard Stern. The Trump campaign, in a footnoted speech, has pointed to an interview in January 2003 with Fox News\u2019 Neil Cavuto, but, as we\u2019ve explained before, Trump took no position in that interview, saying only that President Bush should make a decision: \u201cEither you attack or you don\u2019t attack,\u201d he said.\n\nThat March 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 supported at the time by Clinton, who was in the U.S. Senate, and opposed by Obama, who was a state senator \u2014 marked the beginning of the rise of a terrorist group that has adopted several names over the years, most recently the Islamic State.\n\nWe\u2019ll note that some of Trump\u2019s comments can be taken as opinion \u2014 the \u201cmost valuable player\u201d comment, for instance. But his claims that Obama and specifically the troop withdrawal \u201cfounded\u201d ISIS don\u2019t measure up to the well-documented history of this terrorist group.\n\nIf anyone can be called the \u201cfounder of ISIS,\u201d it\u2019s Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian who formed al Qaeda in Iraq, the group that became ISIS, after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nA June 27 report by the Congressional Research Service provides a timeline of \u201cThe Roots of the Islamic State,\u201d which begins in October 2002, when Zarqawi assassinated USAID official Laurence Foley in Jordan and then relocated to Iraq. By October 2004, Zarqawi\u2019s group was known as al Qaeda in Iraq. He took advantage of sectarian strife in Iraq \u2014 Sunni opposition to U.S. forces and the ruling Shia party \u2014 to build his organization.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic State has its origins in the U.S. invasion of Iraq,\u201d Princeton University professor Bernard Haykel, who heads the university\u2019s Institute for Transregional Study of the Contemporary Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, told us in an interview. \u201cIt is tied to a man named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was killed in an American attack in 2006. I don\u2019t see that Obama has anything to do with it \u2013 at all. He wasn\u2019t even on the scene when the founders of ISIS set it up.\u201d\n\nIn June 2006, Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. airstrike, but Egyptian Abu Ayub al-Masri took over the organization, calling it the Islamic State of Iraq a few months later.\n\nIn an analysis, \u201cFrom Paper State to Caliphate,\u201d for the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Middle East Policy, Cole Bunzel writes that the significance of the group\u2019s name change to the Islamic State of Iraq \u201cwas much greater than was appreciated at the time. It signaled the start of an ambitious political project: the founding of a state in Iraq\u2013 a proto-caliphate \u2014 that would ultimately expand across the region, proclaim itself the fullfledged caliphate, and go on to conquer the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Masri, and another top Islamic State official, were killed in a joint Iraqi-U.S. raid. When U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq at the end of 2011, the CRS report explains, the Islamic State of Iraq \u201cwas weakened, but not eliminated.\u201d\n\nWatts, with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said that 2006 was when the \u201cbig governance model\u201d of what we now see as the Islamic State was formed. There was \u201csome divergence from the al Qaeda brand name\u201d and disagreements between the two groups at this point. When the U.S. troops withdrew, the terrorist group had gone underground, with members in prisons or detention camps, Watts said. In 2011 and 2012, the group was \u201clightly functioning,\u201d but still in existence.\n\nBy 2013, the terrorist group was again launching attacks in Iraq and had spread to Syria, taking advantage of that country\u2019s internal strike. Syria\u2019s civil war started in March 2011.\n\nCritics and experts have pointed to several actions during the Bush and Obama administrations that could have contributed to the rise of ISIS:\n\u2022 The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\u2022 The decisions by the U.S.-led provisional coalition government in 2003 to disband the Iraqi army and dissolve and ban the Baath Party, which drove Sunnis into militant groups.\n\u2022 The rule of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose Shia government further ostracized Sunnis. \u201cBy disbanding the army and making the Baath party illegal and putting in power a Shiite like Maliki, you alienated and radicalized the Sunnis, and gave rise to ISIS in the process,\u201d Haykel told us.\n\u2022 The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011 \u2014 a date set by an agreement with the Iraqi government that was signed by President Bush in 2008, and left unchanged by the Obama administration.\n\u2022 The weakening of the Iraqi army, which abandoned posts in 2014 rather than fight ISIS.\n\u2022 The Syrian civil war, which began in 2011. \u201cThis is really all about Syria,\u201d Watts told us. \u201cThat provided the space for ISIS to rise.\u201d The conflict inspired foreign fighters, and if it wasn\u2019t ISIS moving into Syria, it would be some other jihadist group, he said.\n\nObama and Clinton were not in lockstep over how the U.S. should handle the situation in Syria: Both Clinton and former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta have said the administration should have armed rebels fighting in Syria sooner. During the 2012 presidential campaign, Watts noted, the debate was over a no-fly zone in Syria. Neither Obama nor the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, advocated a deeper military involvement in Syria.\n\nIt is, of course, unknown how any number of different decisions would have affected the creation or growth of the Islamic State, or a similar terrorist group.\n\nSince Trump has pinpointed \u201cthe way [Obama] got out of Iraq\u201d as \u201cthe founding of ISIS,\u201d we\u2019ll take a closer look at that action.\n\nAs we have explained before, Republicans and Democrats differ on which president should be blamed for the withdrawal of all combat troops at the end of 2011. Trump says that \u201c[w]e had a president who decided he\u2019d announce the date\u201d of withdrawal \u2014 but that president was Bush.\n\nBush signed the agreement, known as the Status of Forces Agreement, on Dec. 14, 2008. It said: \u201cAll the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.\u201d Condoleezza Rice later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain, but Maliki objected.\n\nObama, however, had three years to renegotiate the deal, which his administration tried to do, seeking to leave an American troop force of 5,000 to 10,000. But Maliki objected again, and negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Obama\u2019s then defense secretary, Panetta, later wrote in his 2014 book that Obama didn\u2019t press hard enough for a deal, although some experts say it would not have mattered because Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran.\n\nMaliki \u201cwanted the Americans out of there \u2014 and the Iranians wanted the same thing,\u201d Haykel said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a deal to be had \u2014 not one in which the Americans would have had immunity.\u201d\n\nClinton, Obama\u2019s secretary of state at the time, publicly supported the president. In a 2014 interview, she blamed the Iraqi government for the failure to reach an agreement to protect American troops. The Washington Post\u2018s Joby Warrick, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cBlack Flags: The Rise of ISIS,\u201d said in an interview with the Post\u2018s Fact Checker that \u201c[w]ithin the administration, Clinton was one of the loudest forces for keeping a residual force in Iraq.\u201d\n\nSo, both presidents played a role in the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. ISIS did experience a resurgence after that withdrawal, but Watts doesn\u2019t see the withdrawal as a major factor. \u201cISIS didn\u2019t grow because of the troop withdrawal, they grew because there was a Syrian civil war that created a vacuum to the west,\u201d he told us. If the U.S. had left troops in Iraq, the \u201cbest outcome\u201d would be to still have an ISIS in Syria.\n\nAnd how did Trump feel about withdrawing from Iraq at the time? He said several times that the troops should be withdrawn, and quickly. BuzzFeed unearthed several quotes from Trump, including a March 16, 2007, interview Trump gave with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t appear to be advocating a residual force in those comments, but he\u2019s unclear. Regardless, the withdrawal of troops, no matter when or how it happened, wasn\u2019t the \u201cfounding of ISIS.\u201d Nor was President Obama the \u201cfounder.\u201d The terrorist group\u2019s history predates Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 12: After repeating his claim multiple times on Aug. 11 \u2014 in interviews in which he was pressed on what he meant by the \u201cfounded ISIS\u201d comment \u2014 Trump tweeted on Aug. 12 that his claim was \u201csarcasm.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
