(RELATED: Did A Man Die \u2018After Taking Malaria Medication Touted By Trump As Possible Cure For Coronavirus\u2019?)\n\nThere is no evidence that the former vice president ever actually made the statement. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched his Twitter account, the transcripts of his most recent debates and the transcripts and videos of his other recent public speaking events, and found no record of him saying it. An internet search also failed to turn up any proof.\n\nCheck Your Fact recently debunked a viral claim that President Donald Trump made a nearly identical statement: \u201cPeople are dying that have never died before.\u201d Variations of the saying have been in use for decades and have been attributed to former Alabama Gov. George Wallace and author Ernest Hemingway.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not return a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
