In 2017/18, hospitals cancelled more appointments (175,428) than patients not showing up (139,351). However, in the same period, patients cancelled notably more appointments (207,960) than hospitals did. Hospitals account for 34% and patients 66% of all appointments scheduled but not held.\n\nAre half of hospital appointment cancellations done by hospitals rather than by people not turning up?\n\nOn 12 March 2019, BBC Radio Ulster\u2019s Nolan Show discussed whether people should pay to see their General Practitioner in order to reduce the number of no-shows. Presenter Stephen Nolan pointed out to guest Dr George O\u2019Neill GP that people not turning up at their doctor\u2019s appointments \u201cultimately costs the NHS millions of pounds a year\u201d. Dr O\u2019Neill, who argued against the suggestion, responded that in relation to hospital appointments, \u201calmost as many appointments were cancelled by hospitals as were resulted by people not turning up\u201d (01:46-02:10).\n\nOn 2 August 2018, the Department of Health published a report on Hospital Statistics for the period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. The report includes information about Patient Cancellations (CNAs), Hospital Cancellations, and Missed Appointments (DNAs). Data is given for Outpatient appointments \u2014 enabling patients to see a consultant \u2014 and Integrated Clinical Assessment and Treatment Services (ICATS) appointments \u2014 non-consultant outpatient appointments \u201cprovided by integrated multi-disciplinary teams of health service professionals\u201d.\n\nIn total, 1,572,943 hospital appointments were held in 2017/18: 1,456,651 for outpatient services, and 116,292 ICATS.\n\nIn 2017/18, there were 175,428 (166,238 outpatient services + 9,190 ICATS) hospital cancellations (i.e., appointments cancelled by the Health and Social Care Trust provider).\n\n139,351 (128,407 + 10,944) appointments were missed, where a patient did not attend (DNA) an appointment. Missed appointments include cases where patients did not turn up without warning the hospital, and cases where patients warned the hospital on the same day as the appointment was scheduled.\n\nThus, there were even more cases were appointments were cancelled by the hospital than cases appointments not attended by the patient.\n\nSo Dr O\u2019Neill\u2019s claim is reasonably accurate in relation to hospital cancellations and patients not showing up.\n\nHowever, apart from DNAs, 207,960 (191,803 + 16,157) appointments were cancelled by patients who could not attend (CNA) an appointment. In these cases the hospital was warned in advance, \u201cwith the patient contacting the hospital no later than the day before the appointment is scheduled and informing the hospital that they are unable to attend the scheduled appointment\u201d. Dr O\u2019Neill further made the comment that patients often have \u201cvalid reasons\u201d to cancel an appointment.\n\nTaking into account all appointments that were intended to be held, but didn\u2019t occur, a third (34%) were cancelled by the hospital. The remainder (66%) was 347,311 appointments where the patient cancelled or did not attend.\n\nThe graph below shows the number of appointments cancelled by patients, missed by patients, and cancelled by hospitals from 2010/11 to 2017/18, adding up data for outpatient services and ICATS.\n\nFrom 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, there were more hospital appointments cancelled by hospitals (175,428) than appointments where people did not turn up (139,351). However, including appointments that were cancelled by patients (207,960), hospital cancellations account for only a third of the total of cancelled or missed appointments.\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
