Over 28 years, that averages to almost a 10 percent increase each year.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite quadrupling -- a 300 percent increase would have been a quadrupling -- but Obama did say \"nearly quadrupled,\" and we think that qualifies.\n\nAs for Obama\u2019s claim that the \"typical family\u2019s incomes barely budged,\" that seems on target, too.\n\nFor the 60 percent of the population in the middle of the income scale -- that is, excluding the top one-fifth and the bottom one-fifth of earners -- the cumulative growth in inflation-adjusted, after-tax household income was just under 40 percent. That may sound like a healthy increase, but it actually averages to just 1.4 percent per year.\n\nWhile an income increase of 1.4 percent a year above inflation does mean the middle 60 percent advanced economically during the period studied, the increase was only about one-seventh as fast as it was for the top 1 percent. In this context, we think the description \"barely budged\" is reasonable.\n\nWe should point out that the CBO\u2019s findings about the top 1 percent were a little different than the conclusions we drew in a . But there\u2019s a good reason why.\n\nWe calculated that income for the top 1 percent grew between 1979 and 2008 by 169 percent, well below the 275 percent the CBO found. Our calculation was based on data compiled by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who are specialists in income inequality.\n\nHowever, the Piketty-Saez data set excluded capital gains. Capital gains refers to income earned from investments such as stocks, and the lion's share of the nation\u2019s capital gains go to the very wealthy. The CBO data, unlike the data from Piketty and Saez, included capital gains income, so that explains the discrepancy.\n\nObama said \"the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family\u2019s incomes barely budged.\" Calculations by the CBO, a highly credible agency, show an increase of 275 percent for the top 1 percent, which is pretty close to quadrupling. And for average households, income rose by comparatively modest amounts. We rate the claim True.", "lang": "en"}
