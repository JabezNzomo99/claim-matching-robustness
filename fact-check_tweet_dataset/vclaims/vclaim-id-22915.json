{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did Trump Say, \u2018Would You Really Want A President Who Was Dumb Enough To Let Himself Get Drafted\u2019?", "subtitle": "", "author": "checkyourfact.com", "date": "2019-06-07T17:38:25.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-22915", "url": "http://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/07/fact-check-trump-president-dumb-enough-drafted/", "vclaim": "An image shared on Facebook claimed that President Donald Trump said, \u201cWould you really want a president who was dumb enough to let himself get drafted?\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Trump ever saying this. It appears to have originated with a satirical article.\n\nWhile much has been said about Trump and the fact that he did not serve in the Vietnam War \u2013 he received four deferments for college and one for bone spurs \u2013 there is no indication that the quote attributed to him is legitimate.\n\nThe full text reads, \u201cSure, I got deferments. But \u2014 excuse me, Chuck, let me finish. Would you really want a president who was dumb enough to let himself get drafted? I mean, it wasn\u2019t hard to get out of it, believe me. My doctor said I had a bump on my heel or something. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even think he was a doctor, frankly. The government is just very, very stupid. OK? Which is why only I can fix it.\u201d\n\nThe meme claims that Trump said it on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Aug. 28, 2015, so a couple months after announcing his candidacy for president. The show did not air that day, but Trump did appear on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d almost two weeks earlier. The Vietnam War did not come up.\n\nIn the instances where he has discussed the war, Trump has never been quoted as making the statement attributed to him in the meme.\n\nThe quote appears to have originated in an August 2016 piece by Yahoo News columnist Matt Bai titled, \u201cIs there anything Trump could say to make his party cut and run?\u201d\n\nWhile the article is not labeled as satire, it contains many clearly satirical quotes attributed to Republican leaders. For example, it quotes former House Speaker Paul Ryan explaining why he can\u2019t take back his endorsement of Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s no backsies,\u201d it fictitiously quotes him as saying. \u201cI put the sticker on my car already. It\u2019s not one of those magnet deals. It\u2019s really on there. I\u2019d have to repaint the entire bumper.\u201d\n\nThe article claims to be an \u201cexcerpt\u201d from a 2022 book published by Yahoo University Press, which obviously does not exist.", "lang": "en"}
