Be it the chatter around an Indo-US trade deal or the masking of Ahmedabad\u2019s slums, Trump\u2019s visit is attracting eyeballs from all corners. Labelling most of his criticism as fake news or propaganda by media, Trump\u2019s disdain for media is not a hidden secret. However, over the years, he has been in news more than just once for sharing fake news and disinformation. So as India prepares to host the United States president, here\u2019s a list of top 10 moments when Trump was caught sharing disinformation.\n\n1. New Healthcare Plans Less Expensive & Better than Obamacare During his State of the Union address, President Donald Trump claimed that his administration has provided new, affordable and better healthcare alternatives. Speaking at the Capitol, Trump said, \u201cI moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60% less expensive and better.\u201d The claim was later debunked by fact checking website PolitiFact. In the report they pointed out that while Trump\u2019s healthcare plans were not new, the analysis that they are 60% cheaper than those provided under ObamaCare depends on a lot of factors.\n\n2. Donald Trump Says Pelosi\u2019s Speech Tear Was Illegal. But Was It? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created quite a stir with her act of tearing up Donald Trump\u2019s State of Union Address speech. When asked about her act, Pelosi told reporters, \u201cBecause it was the courteous thing to do,\u201d adding that it was \u201cthe courteous thing to do considering the alternative.\u201d Reacting to Pelosi, Trump told reporters at White House that Pelosi \"broke the law\" when she ripped up her copy of his State of the Union address. President Trump: \"I thought it was a terrible thing when she ripped up the speech. First of all, it's an official document. You're not allowed. It's illegal what she did. She broke the law.\" pic.twitter.com/Co1j7ljpGU \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) February 7, 2020 Multiple fact checkers, including Snopes and PolitiFact, debunked the claim. Speaking to various lawyers and experts the fact checkers established that while Pelosi\u2019s act can be categorised as unethical, it definitely was not illegal.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2020 In another case, Donald Trump falsely claimed that House Democrats never sought former NSA John Bolton\u2019s testimony as part of their impeachment inquiry. However, it was later found that while the House asked Bolton to appear voluntarily for a deposition on 7 November, Bolton argued that he would only appear if he were subpoenaed and if a court ruled that he should. The claim was fact checked by PolitiFact. The fact checking website also accessed the statement issued a statement in this regard.\n\n4. \u2018People Who Are in the US Illegally Are Paying for Mexico Border Wall\u2019 On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, President Donald Trump told a rally that people who are in the United States illegally are paying for his Mexico border wall. It was the latest iteration of his effort to convince the public that Mexico is covering the cost, just as he promised throughout his 2016 campaign and since. But what\u2019s the truth? According to an AP fact check, the money is coming from the US treasury, meaning today\u2019s taxpayers and the future ones who will inherit the federal debt. To the extent any people who came into the US illegally are kicking in for the wall, it\u2019s because they\u2019re working and paying taxes like other workers. Trump freed up $3.6 billion for the wall last year by diverting money from military construction projects as well as $2.5 billion from approved counter-drug spending.\n\nIn his New Hampshire rally, the US President repeated his old lie that buses of illegal voters traveled in from Massachusetts in 2016 to deprive him of a New Hampshire victory in the general election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. He had previously in a 2017 interview to Time said, \u201cWell, now, if you take a look at the votes, when I say that, I mean mostly they register wrong \u2013 in other words, for the votes, they register incorrectly and/or illegally. And they then vote.\u201d However, most of Trump\u2019s claims are unfounded. The accusation that people from more liberal Massachusetts crossed state lines in buses and voted in 2016 was made by Republican Chris Sununu, who at the time won election as governor. Sununu later backed down, saying his talk about busloads of illegal voters was \u201cmore a figure of speech\u201d \u2014 in other words, not reality. Trump has repeatedly asserted but produced no evidence of widespread voting fraud in 2016 by people in the country illegally or by any group of people.\n\nDonald Trump, at multiple instances, has accused protesters demonstrating against him of being \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cpaid\u201d. However, he has never been able to substantiate the same with evidence. Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2017 According to a report by Snopes, three protesters filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump after they were ejected from a campaign rally in March 2016, arguing that Trump had incited violence against them. Lawyers representing Trump argued in a court filing that the president had acted legally as the protesters had \u201cno right\u201d to express a dissenting view at his rallies since it violated Trump\u2019s right to \u201cchoose the content of his own message.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 Trump accused former US President Barack Obama of tapping his phone calls. \u201cHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! [sic]\u201d Trump tweeted. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 The US president, however, did not present any evidence of the same. According to a report by FactCheck.Org there is no evidence to suggest that Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump or Trump Tower. Further, there no proof to suggest that any of his conversations were picked up by FBI.", "lang": "en"}
