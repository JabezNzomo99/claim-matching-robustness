A clip of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d on Nov. 13, after the first day of public impeachment hearings. (Note: an earlier version of this article incorrectly said the interview was on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.)\n\nIt turns out this is a classic example of what the Fact Checker\u2019s guide to manipulated video calls isolation \u2014 sharing a brief clip from a longer video to create a false narrative that does not reflect the event as it occurred.\n\nThe ads all begin the same way: in a stark room with a clip of Ocasio-Cortez on television, saying, \u201cThis is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year.\u201d The next few seconds show images of Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Cortez and Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) over an ominous voice-over: \u201cNow, it\u2019s crystal clear their partisan impeachment is a politically motivated charade.\u201d\n\nThe second half varies by district. If a member is supportive of the impeachment inquiry, the ad criticizes them by name, saying they \u201cpromised to be different.\u201d If they oppose it, the ad thanks the member for believing that \u201cthe voters should be the ones deciding elections.\u201d\n\nIn the last minute of the interview, Blitzer asked whether wider issues \u2014 President Trump\u2019s conduct during the Russia investigation, potential emoluments violations \u2014 should be included within any articles of impeachment the House of Representatives might pass. Ocasio-Cortez responded that she believed they should be but added, \u201cat the end of the day, we have to be able to come together as a caucus [on impeachment]. \u2026 We also need to move quite quickly because we\u2019re talking about the potential compromise of the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nShe concludes with these remarks (we highlighted the snippet used in the ad in bold type): \u201cThis is not just about something that has occurred; this is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year.\u201d\n\nFrom the context of the interview, it\u2019s clear she is not referring to Trump\u2019s reelection, as the ad suggests. Instead, it seems she is arguing that the inquiry needs to move quickly to prevent foreign interference in the upcoming 2020 election.\n\nAfter her CNN interview, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) tweeted on Nov. 14: \u201cRep. Ocasio-Cortez admits Dems are using impeachment to rig 2020 against @realDonaldTrump. Take her at her word \u2192 \u201cThis is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year.\u201d Make no mistake: This is about power for Dems. Nothing else.\u201d\n\nAAN isolated one part of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s longer conversation to create the false impression that she had confirmed the inquiry was aimed at preventing Trump\u2019s reelection. This is nowhere close to what she said, nor was it what she meant.\n\nWhile this strategy is nothing new in political advertising, it has been used more frequently in the past few election cycles. Readers and viewers should be wary of sound bites that seem to pack political punches for the opposing party.", "lang": "en"}
