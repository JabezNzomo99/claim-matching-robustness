(I will leave the country if Narendra Modi wins and again become the Prime Minister!!! \u2013 Shabana Azmi!!)\u201d The post drew over 2,000 likes and 800 shares.\n\nApart from Facebook groups and pages, this post was also shared by multiple individual users. The alleged statement made by Azmi was posted by one Shashank Gupta on the group DR. SAMBIT PATRA FANS CLUB on May 4.\n\nSince May 10, the purported quote was being shared in the form of a meme with the images of Azmi and Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan. Bharat Vikas \u2013 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0935\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0938 , a page that made over 2 lakh followers, was among the page that shared the post. I Support PM shared the statement with this caption \u2013 \u201c\u0936\u092c\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0906\u091d\u092e\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u0939 \u0936\u093e\u0939\u0930\u0941\u0916 \u092d\u0940 23 \u092e\u0908 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0936\u093e\u092f\u0926 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u091b\u094b\u0921\u093c \u091a\u0932\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0917\u0947! (Like Shabana Azmi, Shahrukh Khan will also leave the country on May 23.)\u201d This page has more than 16 lakh followers and the post was shared over 5,000 times and had more than 7,000 likes. The comments on the post make it evident that the claim was believed to be true by social media users.\n\nAs claimed by I Support PM, Khan had made a statement similar to Azmi five years ago. Alt News had earlier fact-checked the quote ascribed to Khan and found that it was false and manufactured by a parody account @jamsrk. The post now stands deleted. Khan\u2019s Twitter handle is @imsrk. After the fake statement was viral, the actor took to Twitter and clarified that he never made any such statement. Khan had posted the clarification on May 19, 2014.\n\nThe same quote ascribed to Azmi could not be located on any news reports. Alt News contacted the actor who said, \u201cThis is pure fabrication. I have no intentions of leaving the country. This is where I was born and this is where I will die. I have nothing but contempt for the fake news brigade. Their desperation to try and discredit those who hold a view different from their\u2019s is both vicious and laughable. I have never made this statement attributed to me.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an isolated incident when the actor was targetted using a fake quote. Earlier, we had found a false statement ascribed to her, according to which she\u2019d said, \u201c\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0905\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0928 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u0942\u0902\u0915\u093f \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0916\u0941\u0936 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948\u0964 (India is not a good or a great nation because Muslims are unhappy here.)\u201d", "lang": "en"}
