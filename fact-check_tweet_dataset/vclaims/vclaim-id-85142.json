But there's little evidence of that.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-10-28T07:00:56Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85142", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/10/28/trumps-claim-that-he-predicted-that-obamacare-cant-work/", "vclaim": "So this made us wonder when Trump started to claim that he warned against the structure of the Affordable Care Act when it was passed in 2010. As he put it, he claimed that \u201cthe concept is no good\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s going to be a disaster\u201d and that he knew the premiums were going to soar. Is that remotely true?\n\nVAN SUSTEREN: What is your thought about the health-care reform that is being at least proposed, at this point?\n\n TRUMP: Well, I think it\u2019s noble, except I just don\u2019t know how a country that\u2019s in such debt \u2014 we are really a debtor nation right now, and I just don\u2019t know how a country in this kind of trouble can afford it. It\u2019s very \u2014 I love the idea, but can this country afford it? Will it destroy the country? Will it destroy other people that have been paying into health care for years? I mean, will that destroy other people? It\u2019s a very, very tough situation. I love it from many standpoints, but can this country afford it? And maybe this isn\u2019t the right time.\n\n VAN SUSTEREN: And if we don\u2019t do it, then \u2014 I mean, then people suffer. If we do do it, we go into deeper financial trouble.\n\n TRUMP: It is a very, very serious problem, and that\u2019s why it hasn\u2019t happened previously. But does the country get into a deeper problem that ultimately is going to hurt everybody?\n\nAfter the law was passed in 2010, Trump was asked about it on March 22 by Joy Behar on CNN. (h/t to Daniel Dale of the Toronto Star for finding the video.) Trump said he was \u201ctorn,\u201d and he worried that the law \u201cwould cost a lot of money.\u201d But he made no comment about the law\u2019s exchange structure or the possibility that premium rates would increase. In fact, he said \u201csomething had to be done\u201d to help people without health insurance. He even said that Obama was \u201clooking like a hero\u201d for getting the law passed.\n\nBEHAR: Okay. Let\u2019s talk about the new health-care bill. What did you think about it? Are you happy about it? Are you \u2014\n\n TRUMP: Well, I\u2019m really torn, number one, as a human being, I like to see people, it\u2019s inconceivable that you know people are sick, like you or I get sick or the kids get sick and you bring them to a doctor. Inconceivable that you know 31 million people can\u2019t do that.\n\n And so on one level, I think something had to be done. On another level, it\u2019s really going to cost a lot of money in terms of competitiveness with this country. You know the country is really falling behind other countries, in particular China. China is eating our lunch. What they\u2019re doing to us is unbelievable. We\u2019re not making anything anymore. And I have a friend as an example who runs a big company. And it\u2019s going to cost his company over $200 million a year to do this. Now, again, you go back to the humanitarian side, Joy, but at the same time, this company may not be around any longer because of the cost.\n\n BEHAR: Yes.\n\n TRUMP: So it is a very, very tough situation.\n\n BEHAR: But do you think that Obama has gotten his mojo back?\n\n TRUMP: Well, you know, it is interesting. It is like deals; you can make a deal and you\u2019re a hero, no matter how bad the deal is, whether it\u2019s good or bad, and I see it in business all the time. Somebody totally overpays for a company and everybody says great, great, what a hero and he\u2019s really a hero until four or five years later when everything implodes.\n\n BEHAR: Yes. That\u2019s true.\n\n TRUMP: And the company goes down. And then he gets thrown out of the company. I mean I\u2019ve seen it a hundred different times where somebody buys a deal, everyone says it\u2019s too expensive, but he\u2019s like this great genius, gets salary increases and everything else. And then three years later, it implodes.\n\n BEHAR: Yes.\n\n TRUMP: And the company goes out of business.\n\n BEHAR: Right.\n\n TRUMP: It\u2019s a pretty tough thing but, yes, right now, he\u2019s certainly looking like a hero.\n\nTRUMP: Well, people have said that we\u2019re going to save or we\u2019re going to spend money on the health care, but nobody really discussed the corporations and the competitive nature of corporations compared to the rest of the world, and I am just reading about Caterpillar with $100 million and maybe $100 million a quarter. I am reading about Verizon, where they are talking about the numbers are going to be tremendous, and when you add all of that to the health-care bill, this country can\u2019t afford it, and the competitive nature of corporations, obviously, can\u2019t afford it.\n\n CAVUTO: I\u2019m wondering too, Donald, what happens if big employers like you, I took it a lot of CEOs who are weighing very closely, very carefully whether it is worth it in future years to provide health care for their workers when they\u2019re facing this 40 percent tax on Cadillac plan that may be the better part of valor would be junk the plans, they will pay the penalty and they\u2019ll come out cheaper?\n\n TRUMP: Well, people are talking about it. I have a friend who runs a big public company, and he said to me, \u2018The company is going to spend $200 million a year on health care,\u2019 and they don\u2019t have that kind of money. So people are certainly talking about it. There\u2019s no question about it, Neil \u2026. The country has trillions of dollars in deficits. Companies are really between all of the environmental and all of the other problems that are being imposed, Neil, and lots of other things. They\u2019re not going to be competitive. I mean, where is this country going to go? What\u2019s going to happen in three, four or five years? Where is the country going? They can\u2019t afford it and the companies can\u2019t afford it, and I guarantee you, China, the Chinese companies are spending money like this or they\u2019re probably not spending any money. So health care is a wonderful concept. And it\u2019s there and I\u2019m totally in favor of health care but you have to make it so that the companies in this country can afford to compete with China and India and other countries.", "lang": "en"}
