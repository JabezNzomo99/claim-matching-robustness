The claim with the video is that the idols seen in the video are of Lord Ganesh and they were left at the footpath of Sabarmati riverfront as they weren\u2019t allowed for visarjan. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Ganesh idols left at Sabarmati riverfront as they weren\u2019t allowed for visarjan. Fact: Video is a month old and it shows \u2018Dashama\u2019 idols left on the footpaths of Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad. As part of the Ganesh visarjan too, people of Ahmedabad were requested to not immerse Ganesh idols in the river Sabarmati. Hence, the claim is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the video in the post was run through \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes of it were obtained. On subjecting these keyframes to reverse image search, a certain keyframe lead to the tweet that has the same video. In the tweet, the user mentioned that it is a one-month-old video and the idols seen in it weren\u2019t of Lord Ganesh but of Goddess \u2018Dashama\u2019. With this information, when searched on Google with keywords, an article of \u201cPatrika\u201d published on August 11, 2019, was found. From the article, it was found that the people of Ahmedabad have left the \u2018Dashama\u2019 idols on the Sabarmati riverfront to protect the cleanliness of the river and these idols were later immersed in artificial ponds made for this purpose by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. It is also found that the Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra has lauded people\u2019s efforts through a tweet in this regard.\n\nRecently, in an interview with \u2018India Tv\u2019, AMC Commissioner Vijay Nehra has clarifiedthat the video is a month old one and the idols seen in it were of Goddess Dashama and not of Lord Ganesh.\n\nAs part of the Ganesh visarjan too, Vijay Nehra has urged the people of Ahmedabad not to immerse Ganesh idols in the river Sabarmati and instead asked them to carry out visarjan in the temporary ponds made by AMC for that purpose.\n\nTo sum it up, the video doesn\u2019t show Ganesh idols being left at Sabarmati riverfront, they are the idols of Goddess Dashama.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
