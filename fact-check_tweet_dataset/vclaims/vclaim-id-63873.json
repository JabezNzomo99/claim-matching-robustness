In its 2019 verdict on Ayodhya dispute, Supreme Court allotted 5 acres of land to Sunni Waqf Board for constructing a mosque in Ayodhya. Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Design and first look of Babri Hospital to be constructed in Ayodhya. Fact: Photo shared in the post shows bed tower expansion building design of the University of Virginia hospital. There is no official statement from the Sunni Waqf Board regarding the construction of Babri Hospital in Ayodhya. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn reverse image search of the photo shared in the post, similar photo was found on the website of US-based architecture planning firm \u2018Smith Group\u2019. In the website, it is mentioned that the photo is related to the design and visualization of a bed tower expansion in University of Virginia hospital. When we searched for other official sources using this information, we found a similar photo in the official website of the University of Virginia.\n\nAs the news, \u2018Sunni Wakf Board UP has taken decision on 5 acre land alloted by Supreme Court to construct Babari Hospital and Dr Kafeel Khan may be the Director of the Hospital\u2019 went viral, the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board\u2019s made a Press Release. The release dated 07 August 2020, termed this news to be fake and stated that only Mr. Athar Hussain, secretary/spokesperson is authorised to speak on behalf of Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation.\n\nIn its 2019 verdict on Ayodhya land dispute, Supreme Court allotted five acres of land to Sunni Waqf Board for constructing a mosque in Ayodhya. Following the orders of Supreme court, Uttar Pradesh government allocated 5 acres of land and handed it to Sunni Waqf Board. Accepting the land allocated by U.P. government, Sunni Waqf Board announced that they have a plan to build a Mosque, Indo-Islamic research centre, library and hospital in the land allocated. There is no announcement of constructing Babri hospital from the board as of now.\n\nTo sum it up, University of Virginia hospital building expansion design is falsely shared as the design of Babri hospital to be constructed in Ayodhya.\n\nThe Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board\u2019s Press Release was was added to this article as an additional evidence.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
