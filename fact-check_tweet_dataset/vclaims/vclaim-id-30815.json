This is essentially a weakened version of the virus, patented with the aim of eventually developing it into a vaccine against the disease for birds and other animals.\n\nThis patent for the weakened IBV was granted to the Pirbright Institute in the UK, which says it \u201cdoes not currently work with human coronaviruses\u201d.\n\nOne post also makes reference to funding from Bill and Melinda Gates to the Pirbright Institute.\n\nThe Pirbright Institute does receive some funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, although not for this patented work. The institute was not founded by them as claimed.", "lang": "en"}
