A major tax law negotiated under Tillis\u2019s watch in 2013 eliminated a number of loopholes to help finance a tax cut, including a $20,000 cap on deducting property taxes and home mortgage interest that was aimed at the owners of large homes and estates. But lawmakers, under pressure from the state\u2019s boat building industry, did not eliminate a $1,500 cap on the sales tax for boats and planes.\n\nFirst of all, that\u2019s a two-year number, as North Carolina operates with a biennial budget. A two-year plan is passed, but the second year is adjusted as circumstances warrant. Right now, the North Carolina House and Senate are wrangling over the 2014-2015 budget, even though the ad acts as if the numbers were set in stone last year.\n\nMoreover, if you look at the actual budget numbers, in raw dollars the money spent on K-12 education went up each year, such as from $7.74 billion in 2012-2013 to $7.81 billion in 2013-2014. The $500 million figure is comparing the figures over two years against a \u201ccontinuation budget\u201d\u2014what would be needed to maintain the same level of spending based on inflation, population growth and other factors.\n\nIn other words, this is another debate over the \u201cbaseline.\u201d Both parties play this game\u2014emphasizing the raw numbers when it is to their advantage and the baseline numbers when it is to their opponent\u2019s disadvantage. (Just yesterday, we examined a GOP ad that knocked Obama for cutting Medicare by $700 billion; that was also off a baseline budget.)\n\nAdded to this is the usual complexity involving state school budgets. North Carolina funnels money through Local Education Agencies (LEAs), and there is some strange accounting involving something called a LEA Adjustment, which in theory required school districts to cut their share of state funding every year. But last year\u2019s budget eliminated it.\n\nSo notice that Emily\u2019s List claimed that Tillis cut the education budget by $500 million, forcing bigger classrooms and teachers to buy more supplies. But only $117 million of these baseline reductions occurred in K-12 education in 2013-2014 (the other cuts were in community colleges and university education). That amounts to a decrease of just 1.5 percent of the K-12 education budget.\n\nBudget documents do show, that while eliminating the LEA adjustment, there was a modest increase in class size, because 5,200 teacher positions were eliminated, and a reduction of $6 million throughout the state for school supplies. (This followed an earlier, bigger cut in school supplies in 2012.) The biggest hit in the budget was for teacher assistants\u2014some $110 million.\n\n\u201cSince the 2009 General Assembly, under Democratic control, failed to provide a raise, teachers have been under assault, first financially with salaries that didn\u2019t keep up with inflation and then with attacks on their benefits and security,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cTeachers have not only gone without raises, they\u2019ve seen their health insurance premiums rise, their classroom supply funds cut, their class sizes increased while their teaching aides have been fired.\u201d\n\nThe House, under Tillis, passed a bill this month with a 5 percent increase in teacher salaries, though the budget still requires negotiations with the Senate, which has rejected the House budget. But in theory the new bill essentially wipes out a lot of the 2014-2015 cuts (at least in terms of dollar value) claimed in the ad.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians deserve to know the truth about Thom Tillis\u2019 devastating record,\u201d said Marcy Stech, national press secretary of Emily\u2019s List. \u201cThroughout his career, Thom Tillis has taken aim at classrooms and left North Carolina children behind \u2013 all while protecting himself and his own special interests.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
