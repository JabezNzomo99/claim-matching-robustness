No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on December 14, 2018 titled \"Pelosi : 'Trump Can Have Wall If He Doesn't Run In 2020'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIn a surprising attempt at making a conciliatory deal after the contentious televised meeting earlier this week with President Trump, Nancy Pelosi has made an offer. As presumptory Speaker of the House, she will secure the Democratic votes necessary to fund a border wall if, and only if, the embattled President agrees not to run for re-election in 2020. Pelosi is also willing to throw in a dinner for 2 at Trump's favorite Mar a Lago restaurant.\n\nPelosi denied that she's trying to strike the unorthodox bargain because she fears Democrats chances of victory in the next election. \"Seriously? With his approval ratings and idiotic trade war and racism, we could literally run a one-legged retarded dick monkey against him and win in a landslide. No, what I think, is that his fragile ego and dementia-ridden thought process fixated on 'da wall da wall' all the time might both be satisfied if we promise him the damn thing in exchange for not having to listen to another campaign of douchebaggery and lies. We can always block it after he's either in jail or back to bankrupting casinos or whatever. It's like giving a kid a dollar to shut him up. And he's far stupider than a kid.\"\n\nIf that extended quote doesn't convince you the whole thing is just a joke, the site also comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nIn addition to that the header of the site also says \"Information you probably shouldn't trust to be best\" and the article was published in the category \"GOLDDIGGING SATIRE WITH LOOSE 4 CARROT DIAMONDS\". If after all that you still believe it to be real you should probably get help.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bebest.website as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
