When Altnews put the image through Google Reverse Image search we found many pages with this photograph.\n\nIn fact this image is from a 2015 news article from the Daily Mail. The image is from St. Petersburg. In a bizarre incident a man fed up of security checks completely stripped and walked through the metal detector after which he picked his clothes and walked off. This whole incident was captured on CCTV camera.

With these words, this page has taken two pictures. When we put the first picture on Google reverse image we found out that this picture was not of the Pakistani PM but of a traveler in Charlotte airport of North Carolina. According to the Daily Mail report, he was apparantly protesting his flight to Jamaica being overbooked and he took his clothes off in protest.\n\nBelow, we have compared the pictures and we find that in the picture shared on Facebook, the face is blurred and in the original picture, we can clearly see that it is not Abbasi.\n\nIn the video uploaded below the entire incident can be viewed. This video was uploaded on youtube by TomoNews US on May 26, 2015.\n\nSince the time it was reported by media that the Pakistani PM has been searched at a US airport, old pictures from the internet are being shared. Because the news of Pakistani PM being frisked is true, people are forwarding these images believing them to be credible.", "lang": "en"}
