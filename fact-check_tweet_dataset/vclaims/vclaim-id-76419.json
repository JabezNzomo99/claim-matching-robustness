John Kasich fell into a common trap while campaigning in his home state of Ohio the day before the primary election. He repeated a famous saying without checking it first.\n\nExplaining how he planned to fend off outside interests in his decision-making, the Republican presidential candidate invoked the 33rd president, saying, \"You know what Truman said -- \u2018You want a friend in Washington, buy a dog.\u2019 \"\n\nIt does sound like one of the folksy, farm-charm quips for which Harry S. Truman is known. He\u2019s the leader whose desk displayed the plaque reading, \"The buck stops here.\"\n\nBut did Truman really say, \"You want a friend in Washington, buy a dog?' \" Or is it a myth that solidified through repetition, like a thousand witticisms wrongly attributed to George Carlin in email chains?\n\nPITCH IN $1, HELP POLITIFACT GET $15,000 IN MATCHING FUNDS TO HIRE A FACT-CHECKER\n\nThe definitive information comes from the historians at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum. Sam Rushay, supervisory archivist, told us, \"We have never been able to confirm or verify that President Truman ever wrote or said, \u2018If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,\u2019 a quote that is often attributed to him.\"\n\nThe most often cited source for the non-quote is from a work of fiction. In the play Give \u2018em Hell, Harry, written by Samuel Gallu in 1975, Truman\u2019s character says, \"You want a friend in life, get a dog!\"\n\nPrevious investigators have found the mistake in a 1987 op-ed in the New York Times, and in a 1989 column by the New York Times\u2019 Maureen Dowd. In both cases, the writers credited the quote to the real Truman, and substituted the word \"Washington\" for \"life.\"\n\nHistory proves that Truman was no fan of dogs. The Presidential Pet Museum\u2019s website includes a page on \"President Truman\u2019s Unwanted Dog, Feller,\" given to the White House as a gift from a supporter. The president gave the puppy away to his doctor, which didn\u2019t play well in the press.\n\n\"To what?\" Truman said.\n\n\"Feller, the puppy,\" the reporter said.\n\nKasich told an Ohio crowd, \"You know what Truman said, \u2018You want a friend in Washington, buy a dog.\u2019 \" Though that statement is often attributed to Truman, there\u2019s no evidence Truman ever actually said that.", "lang": "en"}
