No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to fool Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators (or a liberal from Maine) via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Taters Gonna Tate on September 2, 2019 titled \"Al Gore : ' Hurricane is Result Of Trump's Climate Change Denial'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAt the 15th annual Global Climate Change Summit last Friday in Geneva, Switzerland, champion of a weeping Earth, inventor of the internet, and only man to ever lose the Presidency by winning the Presidency told the gathered crowd of scientists and dignitaries that the current hurricane blasting the Bahmas is Donald Trump's fault. Gore believes that placing climate-change deniers in key government positions and dropping cold a host of environmental initiatives has accelerated whatever \"magic doom spell\" the planet is under. There was talk of carbon emissions. Melting glaciers. Extreme weather patterns. Frankly, it's a wonder Al-pocalypse didn't blame Trump for illegal immigration too. Oh. Wait. He did.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThere was no Global Climate Change Summit in Geneva last friday and the story was posted in the category \"Satire that Shoudn't Be Shared By Cops\" (in reference to the real story of a cop who got fired after sharing death threats on Facebook along with one of the satirical hoaxes run by the site).\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes tatersgonnatate.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
