The post claims that a young girl shepherd from Morocco grew up to be France\u2019s education minister 20 years later.\n\nFacebook user N H Partho was among many who posted the claim. Partho\u2019s post was liked by more than 1,700 people and shared by scores of others at the time of filing this story.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the young girl in the first photograph is not Najat Vallaud-Belkacem. Her name is Fouzia and she is a native of Al Haouz Province in Morocco.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe viral post claims to show the past and present of Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, a former education minister of France. The text on the image reads, 20 years ago she was herding sheep in Morocco, now she is France\u2019s education minister.\n\nOn reverse search, we found that the photograph was clicked by United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) photographer Giacomo Pirozzi in Morocco on June 15, 2005. Fouzia was eight years old at that time.\n\nThe photo was published in one of the editions of UNICEF\u2019s Child Notice Morocco. One can see the original photograph on page number 26.\n\nA spokesperson for UNICEF sent the original photograph to fact-check website Snopes\n\nwith the caption, Eight-year-old Fouzia rests on a stone in front of a herd of sheep in Tamezaghete village in the rural district of Iguerferouane in Al Haouz Province. Fouzia attended school for one year but had to drop out because her parents could not afford her books.\n\nBut it is true that Najat does have her roots in Morocco, where she used to accompany her grandfather while herding goats. In a radio interview in 2013, she recalled, I have memories in which I\u2019m with my grandfather, minding the goats, for example; or where I\u2019m fetching water from the well, because we didn\u2019t have running water, or electricity for that matter.\n\nNajat was the first French woman to serve as France\u2019s education minister. She held the office from August 2014 to May 2017.\n\nThus, we conclude that though Najat admitted to herding goats in her childhood, the young girl in the viral image is not her.", "lang": "en"}
