Terry McAuliffe (D), a close Hillary Clinton ally, and the Virginia Democratic Party when she unsuccessfully sought a seat in the Virginia Senate. The donations, and her race, took place before McCabe was involved in the Clinton email investigation. But the article caused a stir in the campaign \u2014 Trump has repeatedly mischaracterized it \u2014 and it put McCabe on the spot.\n\nThe IG report said the article prompted \u201csubstantial public discussion\u201d about whether McCabe\u2019s oversight of the email investigation was appropriate. The next day, the Wall Street Journal reporter (Devlin Barrett, who now works for The Washington Post) emailed the FBI that he was working on a follow-up article that would focus on McCabe\u2019s handling of the Clinton Foundation probe, including possible instructions not to make \u201covert moves\u201d during the election season. A follow-up call with the reporter by the FBI found that he had sources who said McCabe had ordered a \u201cstand-down\u201d on the Clinton Foundation probe.\n\nTo rebut the narrative, the report said, McCabe authorized an aide to leak details about a confrontation he had had Aug. 12 with a Justice Department official who had expressed concerns about the foundation probe progressing rapidly in the election season. \u201cAre you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?\u201d McCabe supposedly asked the official, according to the later Wall Street Journal report.\n\nOnce the Journal article was published, the IG report suggests, McCabe tried to cover his tracks. He called two top FBI officials to berate them for the leaks in the article, the report says. (McCabe said he did not recall making the calls.) And then he misled Comey, the report says.\n\nIn a statement defending himself against charges of unauthorized leaking, McCabe said: \u201cI chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As deputy director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter.\u201d\n\nNote that McCabe does not say Comey authorized the conversation \u2014 and Grassley did not ask whether Comey was aware of anyone in the FBI acting as an anonymous source. So just on that score, it\u2019s unclear how Trump could say Comey lied. But the IG report \u2014 which Trump has touted on Twitter \u2014 further makes the case that Comey\u2019s version of events rings the most true \u2014 that McCabe had not told Comey and so Comey was unaware of McCabe\u2019s role.\n\nMcCabe and Comey disagree sharply on what happened behind closed doors when they met to discuss the article. McCabe claims that he told Comey that he had authorized the leak and Comey \u201cdid not react negatively, just kind of accepted it.\u201d (McCabe does not claim he gave Comey a heads-up on what he was planning to do.)\n\nBut Comey says McCabe \u201cdefinitely did not tell me that he authorized\u201d the disclosure of the DOJ call and, in fact, gave the opposite impression by complaining about the leak. \u201cI have a strong impression he conveyed to me, \u2018It wasn\u2019t me, boss,\u2019 \u201d he recalled. Indeed, he added, \u201cI actually didn\u2019t suspect Andy.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust to make sure there\u2019s no fuzz on it, I did not authorize this. I would not have authorized this,\u201d Comey said. \u201cIf someone says that I did, then we ought to have another conversation because I, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me.\u201d\n\nMcCabe also claimed that other FBI executives were aware that he was responsible for the leak but the IG could find little evidence of that. Ultimately, after telling investigators under oath initially that he was not responsible for the leak, McCabe acknowledged that he was behind the leak. The report said that McCabe \u201clacked candor\u201d \u2014 lied \u2014 three times under oath.\n\nIn the wake of the IG report, it appears that Trump\u2019s original rationale that Comey lied to Grassley has turned to dust. Ordinarily, we\u2019d label that as Four Pinnochios. But Trump\u2019s latest reference to a lie is so vague that it could refer to just about anything, including perhaps the question raised by Grassley and Graham in their letter. So, for the moment, we will keep this at Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
