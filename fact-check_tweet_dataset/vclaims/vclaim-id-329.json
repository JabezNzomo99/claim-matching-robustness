The headline of this post is untrue.\n\nThe post includes a screenshot of a YouTube video headlined \u201cItalian government call for arrest of Bill Gates\u201d ( here , here , here ).\n\nThe original video, still visible online, stems from a May 14, 2020 parliamentary session in which members discussed a new COVID-19 decree ( here ; www.governo.it/node/14602 ). During the discussion, Sara Cunial, an independent member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies (part of the country\u2019s Parliament) and formerly a part of the anti-establishment 5 Star Movement (M5S) party, criticized the decree and the Italian government\u2019s position towards the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nNotably, in 2018, Cunial was briefly suspended and subsequently reinstated by the M5S party after she compared vaccines to \u201cgenocide\u201d on a now-deleted post on social media ( here ). On April 17, 2019, she was expelled from M5S for accusing the party of being tied to \u201cagro-mafias\u201d, ( here ).\n\nDuring her statement presented in this claim, Cunial denounced Gates\u2019 alleged calls for population control, his \u201csterilization campaign\u201d in India, as well as his connections to telecommunication firms behind the adoption of 5G networks in the U.S. Cunial also denounces the fact that Gates is one of the primary funders of the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn the video, it is possible to hear negative reactions to Cunial\u2019s remarks among parliamentary members. At one point, when jeers and booing interrupt Cunial\u2019s statement, the vice-president of the chamber, Fabio Rampelli, intervenes to bring the session to order, ( webtv.camera.it/evento/16202# ; here ).\n\nNear the conclusion of her remarks Cunial, addressing Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, implies Gates should face charges, which is likely where this claim stems from, stating: \u201cNext time you get a call from the philanthropist Bill Gates, forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity\u2026\u201d ( here ).\n\nCunial\u2019s remarks, however, do not represent the Italian government\u2019s stance, but the opinion of one parliamentary member. It is therefore untrue to state that the \u201cItalian government\u201d is calling for Bill Gates to be arrested, as these posts and video descriptions read.\n\nFalse headline claim. The call for Bill Gates to be arrested is the opinion of Sara Cunial, an independent member of parliament in Italy, and not the stance of the \u201cItalian government\u201d.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
