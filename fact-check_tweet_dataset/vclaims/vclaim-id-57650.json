New York City in particular has been described as an epicenter for the outbreak in the U.S.\n\nBut as New Yorkers navigate the public health crisis, a viral Facebook post is adding further alarm by spreading misinformation about what happens when someone dies from the disease. The repeatedly posted image claims that those who die will become property of the state and be incinerated without any \u201cwakes or memorial services.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s wrong, according to local and state agencies, as well as groups representing medical examiners and funeral directors.\n\nThe post uses a picture recently published by BuzzFeed News, which the outlet attributed to a New York City nurse, that is said to show COVID-19 victims in a refrigerated truck outside a city hospital.\n\n\u201cNew York coronovirus victims,\u201d the post reads. \u201cThey\u2019re not letting you bury your own. There will be no wakes or memorial services to pay your last respects. Every contaminated corpse belongs to the state and will be exposed of in a incinerator.\u201d\n\nAja Worthy-Davis, a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, called the claim \u201cridiculous.\u201d Mike Lanotte, the director of the New York State Funeral Directors Association, told us in an email: \u201cI have not seen or heard anything regarding that claim. We are still operating under the state\u2019s guidelines.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Hammond, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Health, noted that Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s March 20 executive order \u2014 which required non-essential businesses statewide to close \u2014 \u201cdoes not apply to essential businesses or entities providing essential services or functions. Pursuant to Empire State Development Corporation (ESD) guidance, essential services include \u2018funeral homes, crematoriums and cemeteries.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThus, funeral homes may continue to operate and hold services,\u201d Hammond said in an email. \u201cHowever, they should postpone services when possible. If services must be held, funeral homes should limit the size of any services or gatherings to as few participants as possible (e.g. immediate family).\u201d\n\nScott Schmidt, president of the New York State Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners, also told us that, to date, there has been no directive like the one described in the Facebook posts.\n\nThere is \u201cNOTHING stating the State owns any body and will incinerate it upon verification of being infected with Covid-19,\u201d Schmidt said in an email. \u201cFuneral Directors, Coroners and Medical Examiners have been briefed on proper handling procedures for such cases as have Cemetery and Crematory Operators.\u201d\n\nIn New York City, there have been numerous news reports about how the volume of deaths has overworked the system and transformed farewells for families. The demand has required the procurement of mobile morgues and created backlogs for cemeteries and crematoriums. Some cemeteries are not allowing visitors.\n\nBut the state hasn\u2019t forbidden funeral homes or cemeteries from allowing services altogether. While the state encourages services be postponed or limited to immediate family, as we said, its Division of Cemeteries notes that \u201cfuneral homes and cemeteries may continue to operate and hold services.\u201d\n\nLanotte, of the New York State Funeral Directors Association, said he was aware of \u201csome cemeteries that are no longer, for safety reasons, allowing visitors.\u201d While a Daily Beast report noted one funeral home\u2019s decision to end visitation, that does not appear to be a widespread practice across the city or state. Lanotte said he has not \u201cheard directly yet of any funeral homes ending visitations. I do know they have adjusted to the new guidelines and are offering private viewings/ceremonies for immediate family only.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, funeral homes are following those guidelines but allowing those beyond immediate family to partake remotely by using Facebook Live or Zoom.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
