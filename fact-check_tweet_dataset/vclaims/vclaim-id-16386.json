We were unable to find any law expressly prohibiting such an action in any state, although objections to the structure and efficacy of mandated child support in rape cases remains controversial. For example, a June 2015 article reported on a case involving a teenaged rape victim who was compelled to seek support in family court, effectively commanding her to maintain a relationship with her attacker:\n\n[Lawyer Wendy] Murphy has been representing a victim who was [14] when she was raped by a 20-year-old, who was then convicted. The convicted assailant was then remanded to family court to pay child support for the baby that resulted from the rape, a court decision that Murphy is still fighting in appellate court in Massachusetts. \u201cIt\u2019s an unconscionable thing to have your own government, in the name of justice, force you into an 18-year relationship with your attacker in family court,\u201d Murphy said of her client\u2019s experience. She also said convicted rapists should be forced to pay restitution in criminal court, not child support in family court.\n\nA 2013 legal paper noted that \u201cvictims of sexual violence hide from their abusers, and child support orders and proceedings [frequently triggered by requests for social assistance] necessarily renew contact between rapist and victim.\u201d The paper further explained that \u201ca dangerous absent parent may react to the child support notification by renewed violence or by asserting rights to custody and visitation, which would seriously harm the mother and child.\u201d\n\nIn a preface, the paper noted that conditions differ from state to state with respect to the burden of proof placed upon rape victims in cases involving child support due to various requirements with respect to social programs and assistance (known sometimes as paternity \u201ccooperation requirements\u201d):\n\nAll states accept official documentation, often in the form of records from birth certificates and documentation from medical professionals or law enforcement. The majority of states provide that sworn statements of third parties with knowledge of the circumstances leading to good cause may substantiate the claim. A minority of states, however, articulate polarized approaches, outlining either a more achievable \u201cpermissive\u201d approach, or requiring more demanding \u201crestrictive\u201d standards. The minority permissive approach allows for both third\u2013party statements and applicant corroboration, while the minority restrictive approach will not accept anything other than official documentation. This Note argues that states must craft evidentiary requirements that are compatible with victim behavior following sexual assault to properly protect rape victims seeking welfare benefits from the danger of continued contact with their rapist through child support enforcement. The majority and minority restrictive approaches are too limited, as they require the rape victim to have reported or disclosed her rape in order to receive benefits, despite the realities of victim behavior.\n\nNo aspect of that preface suggested that victims of rape \u201ccannot\u201d seek child support, only that laws in some states are structured in a manner that effectively discourage or present difficult-to-surmount barriers to such action.\n\nThe primary claim, that 31 states allow a rapist to sue a victim for custody and visitation rights, is far murkier. Unrelated actions decided upon by the Supreme Court in the mid-1990s have upheld state authority over federal authority in cases pertaining to rape.\n\nA possible source for the \u201c31 states\u201d assertion appears to be a 31 August 2012 item published by The Atlantic titled \u201c31 States Allow Rapists Custody and Visitation Rights.\u201d That piece referenced a 2010 law journal article about what might be called a legal loophole, while observing that between 2010 and 2012, several states had amended their laws:\n\nThat 2012 reporting hinted at one factor pertaining to the claim\u2019s accuracy: the passage of time. In 2016, CNN reported that additional states had implemented legislation to address circumstances where the law might not sufficiently protect a victim of rape from being forced to interact with the attacker:\n\nSeven states don\u2019t have any laws preventing a rapist from claiming parental rights, but that\u2019s not to say that these states are oblivious to the issue. Maryland, for one, has been working for years to pass a law that would allow a rape victim to terminate her attacker\u2019s parental rights. Forty-three other states and the District of Columbia have legislation that offers at least some protection to prevent rape victims from facing their attackers over parental rights; eight of those laws were just adopted in 2016. But these legislative protections vary greatly. In 20 states and D.C., a rape conviction is required before a victim can request termination of parental rights.\n\nCNN\u2019s coverage also alluded to another difficulty in precisely determining a rape victim\u2019s vulnerability to custody challenges, namely that a rape conviction is necessary in order for the victim to request her attacker\u2019s parental rights be severed. The piece observed that the requirement is problematic, as \u201cthe majority of sexual assaults don\u2019t even make it to prosecution,\u201d according to Bureau of Justice statistics:\n\nThe article was footnoted with a state-by-state guide to rights granted to both victims and their attackers, laws which very rarely appeared to resemble one another. For instance, the burden of proof in the state of Michigan was \u201cclear and convincing evidence that a child was conceived through sexual assault,\u201d but the alphabetically-adjacent state of Minnesota \u201c[did] not currently have any legislation protecting mothers who conceived their child through rape from facing their attackers over custody and visitation rights.\u201d Whether those laws have changed since 2016 is unclear, and the details of such laws vary to a point where comparison between them is effectively impossible.\n\nThe meme\u2019s fundamental premise (that 31 states allow a rapist to sue a victim for custody and visitation rights) is somewhat flawed in the sense that we could not find any state with a law on its books expressly permitting the perpetrator of a rape, convicted or not, to subsequently re-traumatize his victim using the court as a weapon (as opposed to states that lack laws expressly prohibiting such conduct). Determining a specific number of states in which rapists are not prevented from seeking access to the children of their victims is virtually impossible due not only to rapidly changing laws, but also to broad differences in how such a legal barriers might be enacted in any given state.", "lang": "en"}
