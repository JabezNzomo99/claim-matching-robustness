While there have been various reports on how effective they are, as we wrote recently, there\u2019s not yet any concrete evidence from peer-reviewed studies that the drugs, which are already used for a number of other conditions, will work against Covid-19.\n\nYou also shouldn\u2019t use these medications unless you are specifically prescribed them by a doctor. They can be fatal if taken without proper supervision.\n\nThat aside, this poll by Sermo doesn\u2019t really tell us how many doctors prefer this treatment or how effective it is. The reporting of the poll has also suffered from inaccuracy and overstatement.\n\nThe first thing to note is that Sermo\u2019s poll is not representative of all doctors so we can\u2019t say whether these drugs really have the backing of the worldwide medical community.\n\nPolls, by design, ask a relatively small group of people (the \u201csample\u201d) what they think, and try to make sure that those people represent the wider population\u2014meaning a survey is only as useful as the people it surveys.\n\nSermo\u2019s methodology shows that the sample it surveyed did not match the profile of doctors worldwide and the data wasn\u2019t weighted afterwards to adjust for that.\n\nSo all we can say is that these results are the views of the 6,227 doctors who did the survey, not doctors in general.\n\nThe survey\u2019s limitations aside, the reporting of the results by MailOnline contained inaccuracies.\n\nWhen reporting on the findings, MailOnline reported that the majority of 6,200 doctors said the anti-malarial drug was the most effective. That\u2019s incorrect.\n\nDescribing it as a majority suggests that more than half of the doctors surveyed answered in this way. While these drugs were favoured more than any other option, it was only 37% of over around 2,000 doctors involved in treatment who considered them to be \u201cmost effective\u201d.\n\nAlso, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean these doctors considered the drug to be more effective than the other options. Doctors were allowed to choose more than one option when asked what they thought were the most effective treatments. While 37% picked chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, the majority of these doctors also picked at least one other drug too.\n\nAgain, whether or not these results are representative, you should only take medication specifically prescribed for you by a doctor.", "lang": "en"}
