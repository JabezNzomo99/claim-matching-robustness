He added: \u201cBy the way, the Western media preferred to hush up that fact, not to notice it, though there was one fleeting mention somewhere in Canada, but that was it, then silence.\u201d\n\nContrary to Putin\u2019s claims, numerous Western media outlets, both in the United States and Europe, reported that Russia had destroyed its remaining declared chemical weapons. These include The New York Times, Radio free Europe/Radio Liberty, The Voice of America, Reuters, The Associated Press, Newsweek, and Agence France-Presse.\n\nMoreover, the spokesperson for the EU\u2019s diplomatic service hailed the development in a Sept. 28 announcement: \u200b\u201cThis accomplishment by the competent Russian authorities, the OPCW and contributing States Parties is an important step towards the achievement of the goals of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\u201d\n\nFor his part, General Ahmet \u00dcz\u00fcmc\u00fc, director of Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which tracks efforts to destroy chemical weapons stockpiles under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), described Russia\u2019s action as a \u201cmajor milestone in the achievement of the goals\u201d of the CWC.\n\n\u200bUnder the CWC treaty, which Russia and the United States signed in 1993, the parties agreed to eliminate all their declared chemical weapons by 2007 \u2013 a deadline both countries failed to meet.\n\nThe parties extended the deadline to 2012, but also missed that one. Russia subsequently pledged to fulfill its treaty obligations by 2020, while the United States committed to doing so by 2023.\n\nCommenting in late September that Russia had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpile, Putin criticized the Unites States for its non-compliance: \u201c[The United States] is unfortunately not observing the deadline for destroying chemical weapons. They have pushed the date back three times, citing lack of budget funding. Frankly, this sounds strange.\u201d\n\nA U.S. State Department official affirmed that Washington \u201cfully complies\u201d with the treaty and \u201cremains committed to the complete destruction of its declared chemical weapons stockpile\u201d by 2023.\n\nNotably, during a meeting in 2011, parties to the CWC had recognized the delays in the treaty\u2019s implementation and agreed to destroy the remaining chemical weapons in the \u201cshortest time possible.\u201d\n\nThe Nuclear Threat Initiative, a Washington-based organization that seeks to \u201cprevent catastrophic attacks with weapons of mass destruction and disruption,\u201d reports on its website that the United States had eliminated approximately 90 percent of its chemical weapons stockpiles by 2013.\n\nIn March 2016, OPCW stated that more than 96 percent of all declared chemical weapons had been destroyed. The organization also emphasized that Russia and the United States failed to meet the 2012 deadline \u201cdue to the difficulty and expense of destroying chemical weapons safely and securely.\u201d\n\n\u200bPaul Walker, a program director at Green Cross International, which has assisted with the destruction of chemical weapons in the United States and Russia since the mid-1990s, said that both Moscow and Washington clearly violated the CWC. Still, he stressed that \u201cthe failure to meet these arbitrary stockpile destruction deadlines should not discredit\u201d their commitment to ultimately destroy the weapons.\n\nThe U.S. State Department\u2019s 2017 report on arms on compliance with arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament agreements, published in April, stated: \u201cThe United States continues to work toward meeting its CWC obligations with respect to the destruction of chemical weapons (CW) and associated CW facilities.\u201d\n\nThe report also noted that Washington missed the deadline due to changes in laws that required \u201cresearch and development into alternate feasible destruction methods other than transport and incineration.\u201d\n\nMedia reports also point to political, financial, and technological problems as accounting for the delay.\n\nRussia reportedly spent more than $5 billion to destroy its declared chemical weapons.\n\nAccording to one estimate, the United States, will spend $40 billion to destroy its declared stockpiles.", "lang": "en"}
