But that was based on wrong information.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T15:37:11Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85986", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/19/how-much-did-healthcare-gov-cost-part-2/", "vclaim": "Some weeks ago, we wrote a column examining the cost of developing the troubled HealthCare.gov Web site. We said we would keep updating it as more information emerged. The most recent figure we had, courtesy of congressional testimony by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, was $174 million, as of the end of August.\n\nAt the hearing, held on Nov. 13 by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Powner repeated the $600 million figure several times. He made clear he was speaking about all IT funding for the health care-exchanges, including what was spent at the Internal Revenue Service. One lawmaker lauded him as the \u201c$600 million man,\u201d and several other lawmakers, including Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), cited the number as well.\n\nThe Fact Checker contacted Powner and asked how he came up with this figure, and he shipped us a document that he said appears on the federal government\u2019s IT Dashboard for the health-insurance exchanges. He also made it clear that he believes any cost-figure for the Web site should include back-end and front-end expenses necessary for it to run, such as creating the data hub.\n\nWe forwarded the document to the reader who had originally contacted us, as he had said he used to be a contracting officer for the government. Thus he is familiar with Exhibit 300s. He immediately spotted that it was out of date, and forwarded us the most current version, dated Aug. 1, 2013, which he found on the IT Dashboard. This time, the columns added up to only $318 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not particularly fond of these budget documents, since they are mostly for planning and justifying programs and sometimes bear little relation to reality,\u201d our reader said. \u201cThey are not accounting reports and sometimes do not get enough scrutiny to be reliable.\u201d He noted the document claimed the exchanges would start on Jan. 1, 2014 \u2014 not Oct. 1, 2013. The January date may \u201chave been prescient, but I don\u2019t think it was the intent at the time it was written,\u201d he added.\n\nPowner was surprised to learn there was a more up-to-date document. He questioned why none of the other government officials on the panel questioned his numbers. (Frankly, many witnesses will tell you that the most important rule of congressional testimony is to remain silent unless asked a direct question.)\n\nThere are two links on the IT dashboard, one for \u201cCurrent Exhibit 300\u201d and one for \u201cFY13 Exhibit 300.\u201d The most recent version is under the \u201ccurrent\u201d link, but Powner said that only the older version was available at both links before the testimony. We can\u2019t rule that in or out, but Google search shows the newer version was uploaded to the Web on Aug. 1 and the Web page says it was last updated on Aug. 30. Google cache shows that the Web page looked exactly the same three days before the hearing.\n\nObviously these numbers vary greatly on what is counted. We should note that HHS\u2019s 2014 budget justification to Congress estimated it would cost $2 billion to support the first year of program operations for federal marketplaces (See Page 2). About $450 million would be raised through user fees, and the rest came from appropriations. It is unclear how much would be spent on IT.\n\nMoreover, an HHS official says there is another $630 million in potential obligations for HealthCare.gov going forward. [Update, Dec. 12: In testimony on Capitol Hill, Sebelius provided updated figures. She said that HHS had spent $319 million on the website through the end of October, though a total of $677 million has been obligated, meaning the amount could get that high if bills are submitted.]\n\nWhether all of that money will be spent is another question, but clearly money is being burned now to fix the problems that have emerged. So, when all is said and done, the cost of the Web site could end up above $600 million. If you add in other costs, it could be potentially higher.\n\nPowner is not a politician or an administration appointee, and final cost figures are not yet apparent, so we will withhold any Pinocchios. But we offer kudos to the reader who first raised this issue \u2014 and to all of our readers who pepper us with suggestions and ideas.", "lang": "en"}
