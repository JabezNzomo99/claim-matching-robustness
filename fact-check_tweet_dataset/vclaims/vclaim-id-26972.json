But it applies only to those employed in the formal sector \u2013 just 17% of working people.\n\u2022 None The majority (83%) of employed people work in the informal sector, earning lower wages. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf the average Kenyan wants to buy a snazzy new iPhone XS smartphone, they\u2019ll have to stop paying all other living expenses for 60 days,\n\nIt says the country\u2019s \u201caverage net salary\u201d is KSh44,135, attributing the figure to the\n\n. The iPhone XS costs KSh125,000 (US$1,240) in Kenya, the January 2019 story adds.\n\n\u201cThis means that an average Kenyan will have to work almost 60 days to afford the new Apple device.\u201d\n\nWould it take this number of working days for \u201cthe average\u201d employed person in Kenya to afford an iPhone XS? We checked.\n\nThe number \u2013 exactly 59.5 working days \u2013 comes from a September 2018\n\n, a Polish retail company, of how many days citizens in 42 selected countries would have to work to afford the phone.\n\nAfrica Check asked Picodi how they calculated their numbers.\n\nKatarzyna Koby\u0142ka, who works in marketing and analysis at Picodi, told us the figures came from the Kenya statistics bureau\u2019s\n\nThe most recent average annual wage available (2017) amounts to KSh684,097 (gross),\u201d\n\n\u201cWe used a tax calculator for the year 2017 and divided the result by 12 (number of months) in order to obtain the final amount of KSh44,135 (or\n\nthat showed Picodi used the\n\navailable on the website of the tax-collecting\n\nHow many working days did Kenya have in 2017?\n\nKenya had 250 working days in 2017, or 20.8 working days a month, according to\n\n. If we subtract four extra public holidays related to the 2017 elections, its comes to 246 working days.\n\nThis brings the \u201caverage\u201d amount earned each day to about KSh2,173. It would therefore take 57.5 days to earn the KSh125,000 quoted price of the iPhone XS \u2013 two days short of the 59.5 days\n\nBut net pay is never uniform\n\nNet pay is never uniform, according to\n\n, a partner at Nairobi-based certified public accountants firm AbdulHamid & Victor. This is because contributions and deductions vary for each taxpayer.\n\nFor example, he said, \u201cone qualifies for both mortgage relief and insurance relief separately\u201d.\n\nOnly 25% of formally employed people earn the average wage\n\nKSh684,097 is the average yearly wage earned in Kenya\u2019s private and public sector, according to the 2018 survey. Does it represent the country\u2019s average annual salary?\n\n\u201cNo, it does not. It's the wages of formal sector workers,\u201d Kwame Owino, head of the\n\nOnly 17% of people with jobs were employed in the country\u2019s formal sector in 2017. The other 83% worked in the informal sector. In 2017, a total of 16.9 million people had jobs \u2013 14.1 million of them in the informal sector.\n\nThis means the wages of the small number of formally employed workers can\u2019t be taken to represent the average wage of all Kenyan workers, Owino told Africa Check.\n\nAccording to the statistics bureau\u2019s\n\n, nearly three-quarters (74%) of all formal sector employees earn less than this average gross annual wage (or KSh57,008 monthly).\n\nConclusion: \u2018Average wage\u2019 needed to buy iPhone in 60 days applies to just one in five Kenyan workers\n\nA Polish retailer pulled up official wage data from 42 countries to find out how many days people earning the \u201caverage wage\u201d would have to work to afford Apple\u2019s latest high-end smartphone.\n\nIt would take the \u201caverage Kenyan\u201d 60 working days to earn enough to buy the iPhone XS - without paying any other bills.\n\nBut while the official data does show the average annual Kenyan salary is KSh684,097, this applies to the formal sector. Three in every four Kenyans earn less than this.\n\nAnd Kenya\u2019s formal sector employs only 17% of workers, with the majority (83%) employed in the informal sector. A salary that only applies to 17% of Kenyan workers can\u2019t be taken to represent all workers, an expert said.\n\nWe thus rate this claim as misleading.https://africacheck.org/reports/is-top-ruling-jubilee-party-official-right-about-who-is-paying-income-tax-in-kenya/https://africacheck.org/spot-check/old-unproven-claim-of-8300-super-rich-kenyans-not-from-new-oxfam-report/", "lang": "en"}
