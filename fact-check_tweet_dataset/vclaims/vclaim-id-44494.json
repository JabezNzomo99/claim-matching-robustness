There is a genuine patent Microsoft applied for in 2019, numbered W0/2020/060606. The application does mention technology allowing for people\u2019s activity to be monitored in exchange for cryptocurrency, but there is no mention of implanted chips. The patent application has not yet been granted.\n\nSpecifically, the application is for a system whereby tasks are given to users, which, on participation or completion, can be rewarded with cryptocurrencies. Information is collected from a sensor, coupled with or potentially within the user\u2019s device, to determine whether those tasks have been completed.\n\nThe patent application describes that user device as potentially being \u201cpersonal computers, servers, cell phones, tablets, laptops, smart devices (e.g. smart watches or smart televisions.)\u201d It may also be a piece of wearable tech. The sensor is described as either a device in itself or built into the user device.", "lang": "en"}
