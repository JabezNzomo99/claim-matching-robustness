This website is not affiliated with any political party, PAC, Government Agency of any county, or organization of any kind. Really it's just one guy who builds websites for a living that had a crazy idea that wouldn't go away,\u201d a statement on the website\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page reads.\n\nBoth her youth and political positions as a self-described democratic socialist have attracted an unusual level of media attention for a freshly-minted member of the U.S. Congress.\n\nRussian state-funded broadcaster RT, in a January 5 article headlined \u201cPremature obsession: Ocasio-Cortez's top 7 media moments before setting foot in the Capitol,\u201d wrote that \u201cthe Right, in particular, has pounced on minor gaffes that would be quickly forgiven among their own ranks.\u201d\n\nBut in the case of Kosyrev, what he assumed were gaffes were in fact instances of political parody that he took at face value.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds the premise of his article to be false.", "lang": "en"}
