The hurricane resulted in 103 direct and indirect deaths, all in Texas with over half of directly related deaths occurring in the state\u2019s most populous city, Houston, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nMany people in Texas defied evacuation orders during the hurricane and instead decided to stock up on essentials and stay put.\n\nA number of brand names are visible on the products shown in the supermarket photograph. One of the brands, seen on the top left is Go Veggie, a vegan cheese company. According to the company\u2019s website, the Go Veggie brand is only available in the US and Canada.\n\nThe image of the supermarket shelf stocked with untouched vegan products has been used by meme websites in relation to other disasters, such as this one relating to Hurricane Dorian, which devastated large areas in the Bahamas and caused damage in the US and Canada in late 2019.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be incorrectly linking the supermarket shelf image to the 2019/20 COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. The image of a supermarket shelf full of vegan foods while the shelves either side remain empty has nothing to do with the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. It was originally taken in 2017 in the United States when Hurricane Harvey hit the southern state of Texas.
