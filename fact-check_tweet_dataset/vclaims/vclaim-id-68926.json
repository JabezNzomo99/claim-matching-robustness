Stories detailing the incident have been gaining traction ever since, so we decided to examine what happened.\n\n\"Facebook removes, censors Declaration of Independence as \u2018hate speech,\u2019\" said a July 5, 2018, headline from Geller Report, a website run by Pamela Geller, an anti-Muslim activist and commentator.\n\n\"It\u2019s not surprising,\" the story said. \"The left hates our freedoms, and so designating the Declaration of Independence, the most magnificent document in all of human history, as hate speech is in line with their agenda. The left means to criminalize lawfulness. The left means to criminalize freedom of speech. The left means to criminalize individual rights. The left means to criminalize Americanism.\"\n\nWhat the story does not tell you: Facebook said removing the post was an accident and restored it a day later.\n\nFacebook users flagged this story as part of the company\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe Geller Report cited an article from the Guardian, and Geller pointed in an email to multiple other outlets that also reported on the incident, including the Washington Post, USA Today, Fortune and the Independent.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened: In anticipation of July 4, the Liberty County Vindicator, a small local newspaper in Texas, posted sections of the Declaration of Independence to Facebook.\n\nThe Vindicator soon received notice from Facebook indicating that one of the posts was removed because it \"goes against our standards on hate speech,\" according to a July 2 write-up from Casey Stinnett, the paper\u2019s managing editor. Stinnett said the section was likely removed for its reference to \"merciless Indian savages.\"\n\n\"The removal of the post was an automated action,\" Stinnett wrote. \"If any human being working at Facebook were to review it, no doubt the post would be allowed.\"\n\nLater, Stinnett updated the article and posted to Facebook to announce that the post had been restored. He said the Vindicator received an email from Facebook that said, \"It looks like we made a mistake and removed something you posted on Facebook that didn\u2019t go against our Community Standards. We want to apologize and let you know that we\u2019ve restored your content and removed any blocks on your account related to this incorrect action.\"\n\nGeller acknowledged in her email that Facebook apologized and restored the post, but her story did not mention the apology or the fix.\n\n\"We restored the post and apologized to The Vindicator on July 3 as soon as we saw our error,\" said Sarah Pollack, a spokesperson for Facebook. \"We process millions of reports every week, and sometimes we make mistakes.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Facebook\u2019s censors have removed posts of historical significance. In 2016, Facebook suspended one user\u2019s account after he posted an image of The Terror War, a Pulitzer-prize-winning photograph that depicts a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam War. The photo, removed as nudity and child porn, was eventually restored.\n\nThe Geller Report story had a point that a newspaper\u2019s post of the Declaration of Independence was temporarily removed from Facebook for appearing to violate \"hate speech\" standards. But the website did not mention that Facebook said it was a mistake and restored the post. It did not censor the entire speech.", "lang": "en"}
