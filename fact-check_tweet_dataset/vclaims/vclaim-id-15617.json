Let that sink in,\u201d reads the post.\n\nThe image is fake and was created as part of a Photoshop contest held by the website FreakingNews.com in 2007.\n\nRice played a prominent role in the administration of President George W. Bush, serving first as national security advisor and then secretary of state. She was the first black woman to hold each of these roles.\n\nThe photo, which shows Rice smiling with bin Laden in front of an American flag, appears to have been created in 2007 for an April Fools\u2019 Day Photoshop contest held by the website FreakingNews.com. The site regularly hosts contests revolving around politics and current events.\n\nIn the years since, blogs have continued to circulate the photo, sometimes citing Freaking News or identifying it as an April Fools\u2019 joke.", "lang": "en"}
