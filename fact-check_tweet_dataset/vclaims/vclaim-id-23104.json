The real Gyro Drop ride simply lifts riders to a height while rotating slowly, and then drops them back down rapidly. It does not include swings or rise to the same height as shown in the video.\n\nThe speed with which the ride extends upwards is a notable giveaway to the video being edited as it appears to extend to a huge height in a matter of seconds.\n\nIt is unclear where the edited video came from, but appears to have first circulated social media in mid-June 2019.", "lang": "en"}
