Really?\n\n \n\n We asked the Romney campaign about that $90 billion.\n\n \n\n Five times\n\n \n\n The number appears in a 2010 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers on the American Recovery And Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus bill.\n\n \n\n According to the report, $90 billion is the amount of money in the Obama law for \"clean energy investments.\"\n\n \n\n Here\u2019s how Romney used the number in the debate.\n\n \n\n Obama had attacked $4 billion a year in \"corporate welfare\" for the oil industry. \n\n \n\n (His proposed 2013 budget called for removing a handful of \"tax provisions that preferentially benefit fossil fuel production.\" PolitiFact Ohio reported that the nonpartisan taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense estimates the U.S. tax code currently contains about $5 billion in yearly tax breaks that are exclusive to the oil and gas industry.)\n\n \n\n Romney fired back:\n\n\n\n So, Romney contrasted a \"tax break\" of a few billion for oil companies with \"breaks\" worth tens of billions for \"green energy.\" Later in the debate, he got more specific:\n\nFinally, Romney drove home the number, repeating it three more times, and linking it to companies who have \"gone out of business.\"\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that listeners may have gotten the impression that Obama gave $90 billion in tax breaks in a single year to companies for alternative energy like solar and wind, many of which didn\u2019t fare well.\n\n \n\n \u2018One year\u2019 of \u2018breaks\u2019\n\n \n\n Back to that report about stimulus spending on clean energy.\n\n \n\n Were there $90 billion in \"breaks\"? Perhaps in a generic sense, as in \u2014 some folks caught a break by taking advantage of government spending. But not so much if Romney meant \"tax breaks\" like those for oil and gas.\n\n \n\n Rather, the money was distributed in six different ways: private and public matching grants, tax credits, loan guarantees, direct loans and interest subsidies. Tax benefits were part of the package, but so were very different kinds of spending.\n\n \n\n \"The vast majority of the $90 billion for green energy weren't tax breaks,\" said Michael Grabell, a reporter for Pulitzer-winning site ProPublica who published a book this year on stimulus spending, Money Well Spent?\n\n \n\n Meanwhile, the money would have been distributed over longer than one year, depending on the program. Some money \u2014 such as for high-speed rail \u2014 states still have a few years to spend, Grabell said. Weatherization projects, among the quicker programs, took two or three years. The loan guarantee program through the Department of Energy, which benefitted troubled solar panel maker Solyndra, focused on projects through September 2011.\n\n \n\n So, Romney is off in two respects. They are not just tax breaks and they are not just for one year.\n\n \n\n \u2018Solar and wind ... Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1\u2019\n\n \n\n We\u2019ll assume Romney meant \"solar and wind\" and \"Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1,\" as merely examples of Obama\u2019s $90 billion in green energy spending in the stimulus.\n\n \n\n But even as examples, they\u2019re problematic. \"Solar and wind\" investments represented comparatively small parts of the $90 billion.\n\n \n\n Solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra and electric-battery maker Ener1, which got stimulus-backed help, qualified for less than $700 million in grants and loan guarantees, and didn\u2019t use it all.\n\n \n\n Fisker and Tesla \u2014 troubled electric-car companies that got loan guarantees funded with money appropriated under President George W.Bush \u2014 had nothing at all to do with the $90 billion.\n\n \n\n So, just what did make up the $90 billion?\n\n \n\n The Council of Economic Advisers report cited by the Romney campaign breaks the spending into eight categories. Here\u2019s the majority of it:\n\n\n\n\n\n That\u2019s more than 60 percent of the $90 billion Romney\u2019s campaign said he was talking about. Much of it funneled through state and local governments to contractors for specific projects, rather than as breaks directly for companies.\n\n \n\n Less than 40 percent of the $90 billion included was for things such as the installation of wind turbines and solar panels, supporting American manufacturing of advanced batteries and other advanced vehicle technology, research and development of clean coal technology and a few billion in tax credits for alternative energy.\n\n \n\n Those investments are more in line with Romney\u2019s characterization. But they represent less than half the \"$90 billion\" he repeatedly mentioned.\n\n \n\n Why does it matter if Romney mischaracterized how the money was used, as long as it went to clean energy? He draws a conclusion about winners and losers, and says, \"and these businesses, many of them have gone out of business.\"\n\n \n\n It\u2019s a claim that our colleagues at FactCheck.org addressed this week, pointing out that might be true of companies that got loan guarantees in a single year \u2014 a sliver of a sliver of the money that Romney\u2019s talking about. But less than 12 percent of the 26 companies that ultimately benefited from the program filed for bankruptcy, FactCheck.org reported.\n\n \n\n And the entire loan guarantee program represented just a few billion of the $90 billion investment outlined by the Council of Economic Advisors.\n\n \n\n \"A very small percentage of all the companies that benefited from the $90 billion in green job spending have gone out of business,\" said Grabell, the author of Money Well Spent? \"Not half of them. Not even half of the loan guarantees. \"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n Romney used the number \"$90 billion\" five times in the first presidential debate, claiming, \"In one year, (Obama) provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world \u2026 into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1.\"\n\n \n\n That is incorrect in several ways. That $90 billion, as described in a report provided by the Romney campaign, wasn\u2019t provided in one year, wasn\u2019t distributed primarily via tax breaks, wasn\u2019t primarily provided directly to companies, wasn\u2019t primarily spent on solar and wind, and wasn\u2019t spent at all on Fisker or Tesla.\n\n \n\n In reality, more than 60 percent of it was directed to state and local governments and utility companies for energy efficiency, transportation and electrical infrastructure .\n\n \n\n We rate his claim False.", "lang": "en"}
