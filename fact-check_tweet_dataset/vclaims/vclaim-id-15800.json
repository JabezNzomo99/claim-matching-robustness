Insha Allah! (This Navratri, I pray to Allah that no Lakshmi should have to beg, no Durga should be aborted, Parvati wouldn\u2019t have to give dowry, Saraswati shouldn\u2019t be illiterate and Kali shouldn\u2019t need Fair and Lovely! Insha Allah!)\n\nThe post also poses a question to Shabana that reads, Kya ye teen talaq, char biwiya, burqa, halala, jansankhya niyantran par bolegi? (Will she talk about triple talaq, polygamy, burqa, halala and population control?)\n\nReacting to this, Shabana on Tuesday tweeted that the quote is falsely attributed to her and she works for all women irrespective of their religion.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that during Navratri in 2017, Shabana Azmi did make a similar remark. This has been pointed out by many in the comment section of her tweet.\n\nThe original tweet of Shabana is in English that reads, This Durga Asthami, let\u2019s pray that no Durga is aborted, no Saraswati is stopped from going to school, no Lakshmi has to beg for money from her husband, no Parvati is sacrificed for dowry and no Kali is given a tube of fairness cream!!!\n\nThe viral quote is the translation of Shabana\u2019s original tweet, but with some changes. Shabana\u2019s tweet says that no Lakshmi should beg for money from her husband, but in the translation, the context of husband\u2019 is missing. Words such as Insha Allah have also been added to the viral post.\n\nIndia Today reached out to Shabana Azmi regarding this matter. Shabana told us that she is flying to Edinburg, Scotland and asked us to read the story of Boomlive on the same matter. The story says that text in Shabana's tweet may not be her own words because the same text had been posted by some other netizens also.", "lang": "en"}
