The WHO rate comes from the actual number of known cases and fatalities.\n\nThe dispute began March 3 when the head of the WHO announced that the mortality rate for the new coronavirus was 3.4%, which was higher than previously believed and made it far more deadly than the seasonal flu.\n\n\u201cGlobally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 (the disease spread by the virus) cases have died,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a briefing. \u201cBy comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.\u201d\n\nHe said there had been 90,893 reported cases of COVID-19 globally, and 3,110 deaths.\n\nTrump challenged that number. \u201cWell, I think the 3.4% is really a false number,\u201d Trump said in a telephone interview March 4 with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity.\n\nThe problem, the president said, was that many people with mild cases of coronavirus simply weren\u2019t being counted, resulting in a deceptively high figure for the percentage who have died.\n\nTrump, March 4: Now, this is just my hunch, and \u2014 but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it\u2019s very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don\u2019t even see a doctor. They don\u2019t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people. So, you can\u2019t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu and \u2014 or virus. So you just can\u2019t do that. So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work \u2014 some of them go to work, but they get better. And then, when you do have a death, like you have had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California \u2014 I believe you had one in New York \u2014 you know, all of a sudden, it seems like 3 or 4%, which is a very high number, as opposed to \u2014 as opposed to a fraction of 1%. But, again, they don\u2019t \u2014 they don\u2019t know about the easy cases, because the easy cases don\u2019t go to the hospital. They don\u2019t report to doctors or the hospital in many cases.\n\nThe actual mortality rate, Trump said, \u201cis way under 1%.\u201d\n\nFor comparison, SARS killed around 10% of infected people, if not more, while seasonal influenza typically kills 0.1% or less, David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, told us in a January email.\n\nA number of disease experts agree with Trump that there are many unreported cases and that the rate reported by the WHO is higher than the rate will end up being over time. It\u2019s relatively easy to know how many people have died from the disease. But it takes a while to have a fuller sense of how many people have it, for the reason Trump cited \u2014 they have a mild case and haven\u2019t sought treatment \u2014 or because they don\u2019t even know they have it. And very little testing has been done. In other words, experts say, we have the numerator but not the denominator.\n\nIn time, and once much more testing has been carried out, the rate will fall, they say. But one WHO expert who visited China doesn\u2019t think there are that many undiagnosed cases.\n\nVaccine expert Paul A. Offit told us the rate could go below 1% as Trump says. \u201cI think Trump is right,\u201d said Offit, who holds the Maurice R. Hilleman Chair of Vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nOffit likens the situation to the swine flu epidemic of 2009. At one point, he said, the mortality rate was thought to be much higher than the 0.01 to 0.03% it turned out to be. He thinks the mortality rate for coronavirus will similarly plummet and the \u201cfalse notion that it is more likely to kill you than influenza\u201d will disappear.\n\nOffit believes there has been a \u201cwild overreaction\u201d to the disease, in part because it is new. \u201cWe\u2019re more the victim of fear than the virus,\u201d he said.\n\nOther experts agree that mortality rates at this point in an outbreak are wobbly since its full extent is not known. Fisman told us in January that statistics at the time might not tell the full story. He said it was likely far more people had been infected, but had not gone to hospitals or had their illnesses confirmed. At the same time, he pointed out that some of the people who are sick might die, pushing the rate in the other direction.\n\nGary Kobinger, director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at Laval University in Quebec, told the health website STAT in February that it would be highly unusual if there weren\u2019t mild cases that had been missed. The website\u2019s article said: \u201cHe pointed to the fact that outbreaks have popped up in countries far from China \u2014 including Iran and Italy \u2014 because people with mild infections were not detected and traveled to other places.\n\n\u201cThere are mild cases that are undetected. This is why it\u2019s spreading. Otherwise it would not be spreading because we would know where those cases are and they would be contained and that would be the end of it,\u201d Kobinger told STAT.\n\nBut there is by no means unanimity on the subject. Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist who led a WHO team to inspect China\u2019s response to coronavirus, doesn\u2019t believe there are nearly as many undiagnosed cases as other scientists do.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that we\u2019re seeing only the tip of a grand iceberg, with nine-tenths of it made up of hidden zombies shedding virus,\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a pyramid: most of it is aboveground.\u201d\n\nIn Guangdong, he said, \u201cthey went back and retested 320,000 samples originally taken for influenza surveillance and other screening. Less than 0.5 percent came up positive, which is about the same number as the 1,500 known Covid cases in the province.\u201d He concluded, \u201cOnce we can test antibodies in a bunch of people, maybe I\u2019ll be saying, \u2018Guess what? Those data didn\u2019t tell us the story.\u2019 But the data we have now don\u2019t support it.\u201d\n\nA Feb. 28 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, co-authored by Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, took the position that the mortality rate may well fall dramatically. It said if one assumed that there were several times as many people who had the disease with minimal or no symptoms as the number of reported cases, the mortality rate may be considerably less than 1%. That would suggest \u201cthe overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza,\u201d the editorial said.\n\nAfter the WHO announced the 3.4% mortality rate, a number of medical experts asserted that the rate would shrink over time.\n\n\u201cWhen we see systems that are able to account for not only the really sick, but also those who have infection and are outpatients, the CFR [case fatality rate] is more accurate and drops considerably,\u201d Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said in an interview with the website Vox.\n\nLawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, had a similar view. He told Vox, \u201cTo get a rate, you need the deaths \u2014 which you can more reliably pick up \u2014 and you need cases, which you can less reliably pick up. It\u2019s not irresponsible to come out with that number, but it should have been more clearly interpreted as not being reliable, or at least mention it\u2019ll vary in regions.\u201d\n\nA February study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of cases in China found a mortality rate of 2.3%. But the new coronavirus hit the elderly particularly hard: The rate was 14.8% in patients 80 and older and 8% for those 70 to 79.", "lang": "en"}
