A video clip of a WHO official saying exactly that in a press conference is circulating on social media with the claim that the global health body has taken a \u201ccomplete U-turn\u201d.\n\nIn the viral clip, epidemiologist and WHO technical lead on the coronavirus pandemic Maria Van Kerkhove is heard saying, \u201cFrom the data we have, it seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a second individual.\u201d\n\nThe clip of the WHO press briefing and subsequent TV discussion was a part of an American news programme \u201cGreg Kelly Reports\u201d on Newsmax TV. Anchor Greg Kelly was also astonished at the statement. The video started circulating on Twitter and Facebook with the caption, \u201cBig Story: Unbelievable! Asymptomatic patients need no isolation ... A complete U-turn by WHO. After destroying the economy of the world now a complete U-turn!!\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral clip is genuine and WHO did indeed say that asymptomatic spread of Covid-19 seems to be rare. However, it later clarified that it does not have the data to back it up as scientists are still determining the intensity of spread by asymptomatic Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe archived version of the viral clip is saved here. Many Facebook users have shared the video.\n\nIn a press briefing on June 8, in an answer to a question on the asymptomatic spread of Covid-19, Kerkhove said, \u201cWe are constantly looking at this data and we\u2019re trying to get more information from countries to truly answer this question. It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward.\u201d\n\nThe remark caused an uproar as it contradicts many public health experts who have been talking about the asymptomatic spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe following day, the WHO clarified that it still does not have the answer to the intensity of spread caused by asymptomatic patients.\n\n\u201cThe majority of transmission that we know about is that people who have symptoms transmit the virus to other people through infectious droplets. But there is a subset of people who don\u2019t develop symptoms and to truly understand how many people don\u2019t have symptoms, we don\u2019t actually have that answer yet,\u201d Kerkhove said.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert in the US, said the WHO\u2019s statement on asymptomatic spread \u201cwas not correct\u201d. At the \u201cABC News\u201d programme \u201cGood Morning America\u201d, Fauci said according to \u201cCNN\u201d, evidence shows 25-45 per cent of infected people do not likely have symptoms.\n\n\u201cAnd we know from epidemiological studies they can transmit to someone who is uninfected even when they\u2019re without symptoms,\u201d said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\u201cAsymptomatic spread is Achille\u2019s heel of this outbreak,\u201d tweeted Ashish K Jha, director of Harvard Global Health Institute. Reacting to WHO\u2019s comments on the asymptomatic spread, Jha posted a twitter thread saying, \u201cBoth asymptomatic AND pre-symptomatic spread huge problem for controlling the disease. Because folks shedding virus while asymptomatic. Pre-symptomatic has one advantage: you can use contact tracing to find folks they infected. But that doesn\u2019t help prevent the presymptomatic spread\u201d.\n\nAsymptomatic cases are challenging to identify because individuals do not know they are infected unless they are tested, typically as part of a scientific study. Therefore, various studies and their findings vary in this aspect.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 35 per cent of all people with Covid-19 are asymptomatic, but they are just as infectious as those with symptoms. As per the CDC, 40 per cent transmissions take place before people feel sick.\n\nThe WHO has indeed said that asymptomatic spread of the new coronavirus is rare. But it later clarified that it does not have enough data about the asymptomatic spread of the disease, as scientists are still determining the intensity of Covid-19 spread by asymptomatic cases.", "lang": "en"}
