One reason the deficit soared during Reagan\u2019s term is because spending went up as a share of the economy and revenues went down.\n\nBut we can get even more specific about the impact of the 1981 cut in rates. A Treasury Department study on the impact of tax bills since 1940, first released in 2006 and later updated, found that the 1981 tax cut reduced revenues by $208 billion in its first four years. (These figures are rendered in constant 2012 dollars.) The tax reform act of 1986, which was designed to be revenue neutral, reduced revenues by less than $1 billion four years after enactment.\n\nMoore, in an interview, acknowledged that \u201ccertainly there were tax increases\u201d but he insisted that the cut in tax rates generated \u201chuge revenue gains.\u201d He said that the \u201ctax increases were small, compared to the tax cut, which was huge.\u201d In particular, he said that the wealthy started paying more in taxes, and he said the booming economy resulted in increased tax revenues.\n\nThat\u2019s actually not readily apparent from the data. Certainly, the share of taxes paid by the top 1 percent went from 17.9 percent in 1981 to 25.2 percent in 1989, for an increase of 41 percent, according to IRS data. But the income share of the top 1 percent increased even more dramatically, from 8.3 percent to 14.2 percent\u2014a gain of 71 percent. So a lot of the increase in taxes came from a more dramatic increase in wealth.\n\nMoore directed us to a paper he co-wrote in 1996 while at the Cato Institute, which offered a defense of the Reagan economic record. As we said, that\u2019s for economic historians to sort out. But the paper says it was \u201can enduring myth\u201d that Reagan officials believed tax cuts would pay for themselves. \u201cThis was nonsense from day one, because the credible evidence overwhelmingly indicates that revenue feedbacks from tax cuts is 35 cents per dollar, at most,\u201d the paper says, noting that \u201cthe Reagan administration never assumed that the tax cuts would pay for themselves.\u201d\n\nBruce Bartlett, a former Treasury Department official who helped craft the 1981 tax cut as a congressional aide at the time, in a 2011 article for Tax Notes reproduced the Reagan administration and Congressional Budget Office scores of the Reagan tax plan. Both predicted revenues would fall as a result of the tax cut. But both turned out to be off the mark about extent of the fiscal impact because the 1981-1982 recession turned out to be deeper than expected and inflation fell more rapidly than expected. That steep decline in revenues is a major reason why Reagan boosted taxes just one year after his tax cut.\n\nMoore \u201cis trying to attribute to the tax cut all of the normal cyclical rise in GDP growth after the 1981-82 recession,\u201d Bartlett said in an e-mail. \u201cFurthermore, he is attributing to the tax cut the effects of the sharp cut in interest rates by the Fed and the big increase in federal spending for defense. I don\u2019t know if anyone has ever done a proper accounting of the relative impact of all these effects, but I would say that the 1981 tax cut was the least of them.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Moore in his article said \u201cnearly 40 million jobs were created between 1982 and 2000,\u201d which could be where Paul came up with his \u201ctens of millions of jobs\u201d language. But that time period also includes the Clinton years\u2014and Clinton of course reversed some of the Reagan tax cuts and increased the top tax rate to 39.5 percent. Nevertheless, the economy boomed as well.\n\nIt\u2019s always hard to make judgments on economic issues, as the impact of various policies can be vigorously debated. We have no opinion on whether the 1981 Reagan tax cut was good or bad for the economy, except that it seems rather simplistic to attribute every good thing that happened to a single event. As Bartlett noted, Federal Reserve policy and the stimulus from increased government spending were also important factors.\n\nOne could certainly believe that cutting tax rates\u2014and simplifying the tax code\u2013were important steps to set to stage for later economic growth, which of course brings in higher tax revenues. But the tax cut itself was a money-loser for the government\u2013and it was not the sole reason for \u201ctens of millions\u201d of jobs. We cannot quite say Paul committed a Four-Pinocchio violation, but it\u2019s close.", "lang": "en"}
