It jumped from about 85 percent in 2008 as the Obama administration pushed to eliminate paper Social Security checks. Most recipients get their payments either deposited in their bank accounts or on a debit card that is filled automatically every month.\n\nDoing the math, there are about 555,000 Americans who still get Social Security checks by mail and about 215,000 who get Supplemental Security Income (SSI) checks by mail. That compares with 61.5 million who receive direct deposit either to the bank or a debit card.\n\nOf course, you still need to rely on the mail to get the debit card. Social Security notices also come through the mail, unless a person opts out. But relatively few people still get checks.\n\nCuomo took credit for a sharp decline recently in novel coronavirus cases in New York. But he has been criticized for delaying a shelter-in-place order for New York until the pandemic had \u201cthe number of confirmed cases at 15,000 doubling every three or four days,\u201d according to ProPublica.\n\nIn his remarks, Sanders instead made reference to one of the recommendations from the Biden-Sanders unity task force, which says that \u201cto reach net-zero emissions as rapidly as possible, Democrats commit to eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 through technology-neutral standards for clean energy and energy efficiency.\u201d That\u2019s a 15-year timeline, but for the moment, these are simply recommendations that Biden says he will consider. Moreover, the \u201ctechnology-neutral\u201d language gives Democrats some wiggle room. The term encompasses renewable energy such as solar and wind, and nonrenewable sources such as nuclear or carbon capture.\n\nThe 30 million figure is one way to measure job loss during early stages of the pandemic. It is based on jobless claims, but other metrics, such as the monthly employment numbers, suggest much lower numbers. More than 5 million people are estimated to have lost their health insurance. We will leave to the copy editors among our readers to decide whether \u201cmany\u201d is the correct usage in this sentence.\n\nThe playbook: Longoria Bast\u00f3n is referring to a 40-page document (not counting appendixes) \u2014 a National Security Council staff playbook on fighting pandemics. Now, just about every war plan falls apart with the first battle, but a case could be made that there was useful information in the playbook. Most notably, the color-coded document lists dozens of pointed and detailed questions that top policymakers could ask themselves to prepare for a novel virus suddenly emerging from overseas.\n\nThe playbook also helpfully details the responsibilities and expertise of each agency that could be tasked with dealing with such a crisis. At the very least, the document could have served as a starting point for action and might have helped officials understand the gravity of the problem sooner. Trump administration officials insisted the document was out of date and of little value \u2014 without explaining why a new playbook was not put in place.\n\nThe pandemic response team: After Barack Obama became president in 2009, he eliminated the White House Health and Security Office, which worked on international health issues. But after grappling with the 2014 Ebola epidemic, Obama in 2016 established a Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense at the NSC. A directorate has its own staff, and it is headed by someone who generally reports to the national security adviser.\n\nThe structure survived during the early part of Trump\u2019s presidency, when the office was headed by Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer. But after John Bolton became Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, he decided the organizational chart was a mess and led to too many conflicts. So he folded the global health directorate into a new one that focused on counterproliferation and biodefense.\n\nAs far as we can determine, the positions that made up the old unit still are filled within the NSC, most in the nonproliferation directorate; one was moved to another directorate. The question that cannot be answered is whether a separate directorate would have had more clout to bring the issue immediately to the president\u2019s attention.\n\nOne former administration official dismissed the debate over the NSC office as a relic of another type of presidency. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any organizational chart in the U.S. government that makes any difference in the Trump administration,\u201d the official told The Fact Checker. \u201cTrump is more likely to say to Jared [Kushner], \u2018What do you think we should do?\u2019 That\u2019s the big problem.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
