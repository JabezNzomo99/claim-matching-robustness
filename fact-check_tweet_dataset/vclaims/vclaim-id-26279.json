The claim that is going viral with the video is that the boy was being beaten by the Police for not bringing tea to them. Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of a young boy being tortured by Policemen for not bringing them tea. Fact: The video shows Policemen torturing the boy, who was accused of theft. The UP Police have suspended Paniyara PS Sub Inspector KN Shahi, the senior cop seen in the video for his act. Hence, the claim that the young boy was being tortured by Policemen for not bringing them tea is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video in the post were subjected to reverse image search technique, many search results were obtained. Among them, the search result of \u2018NDTV\u2019 had the same and longer video of the one in the post. From that article, published on November 18, 2017, it was found that two policemen of Paniyara PS in Maharajganj district of Uttar Pradesh have brutally assaulted a young boy, who was accused of theft. Also, the senior cop seen in the video, Sub Inspector KN Shahi, was suspended by the UP Police higher authorities for that act.\n\nTo conclude, an old video of a young boy being tortured by Policemen is now being shared with a false narrative. \n\n\n\nNote: This fact-check is not to justify the brutal act of the police, but only to highlight the false narrative around an old video.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
