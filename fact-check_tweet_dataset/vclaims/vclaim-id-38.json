They would never support a product that can harm you or your children. The scientist that continued to say cigarettes are safe would never have an insidious agenda. Never.\u201d\n\nThe advertisements in the post promote the use of nicotine during pregnancy, the use of insecticide DDT to keep flies away from babies, the use of \u201cheroin hydrochloride\u201d by order of a physician, and asbestos as a good option for building insulation.\n\nThe claim is likely circulating because of the CDC\u2019s current spotlight in managing the spread of COVID-19, here .\n\nThe CDC is a federal agency under the Department of Health and Human Services, founded in 1946. Its stated goal is to protect public health and safety through \u201chealth promotion, prevention of disease, injury and disability, and preparedness for new health threats\u201d, here. Although the CDC plays a role in the regulation of certain products, this also fits within the objectives of other federal agencies, including the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), here.\n\nReuters looked at the source of the advertisements featured in this post and researched any possible links with the CDC.\n\nThe \u201cNico Time\u201d advertisement promoting smoking during pregnancy is fake. It stems from the video game series Bioshock, see here. Their site confirms the \u201cNico Time\u201d advertisement was designed by Kat Berkley, an artist who worked on the game (see here and here).\n\nBefore the 1964 surgeon general\u2019s report on smoking, tobacco companies in the U.S. did produce advertisements downplaying the risks of smoking, here. Although in 1963, the FDA expressly stated that tobacco did not fit under the category of \u201chazardous\u201d substances, by 1965 the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act required labels on cigarette packs warning of potential health hazards, here.\n\nIn September 1965, the Public Health Service established a small unit called the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health. This unit\u2014later the Office on Smoking and Health, under the CDC\u2014has been responsible for 29 reports on the health consequences of smoking, here. It is therefore false that the CDC promoted smoking, or the use of nicotine.\n\nThe poster for DDT, the harmful synthetic insecticide, is real. A reverse image search finds that it was an advertisement for the insecticide company Black Flag, which produced DDT, visible here. Black Flag made similar advertisements, one visible here, that the Science History Institute dates to the 1940\u2019s.\n\nPer the CDC, the U.S. banned the use of DDT in 1972 (here).\n\nAccording to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), the regulation of DDT began in the 1950s and 1960s because of \u201cmounting evidence of the pesticide\u2019s declining benefits and environmental and toxicological effects\u201d, here. Reuters was unable to corroborate any role the CDC might have played in DDT\u2019s initial use or its later regulation by the federal government. It is likely that the CDC\u2019s policies would be in line with the EPA\u2019s stance since the 1950s, as a fellow government agency.\n\nThe label that reads \u201cHeroin hydrochloride\u201d, and \u201cThe Bayer Co. LTD\u201d, is also real. According to Forbes, the German pharmaceutical company Bayer \u201ccommercialized heroin as a cough suppressant and morphine substitute\u201d in the late 19th and early 20th century (here). According to a United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report on the history of Heroin, there was widespread enthusiasm for this drug in the early 20th century and this was \u201cillustrated in the medical literature of the time\u201d (here).\n\nIn 1914, the Harrison Narcotics Act had been passed in the U.S. to heavily regulate opium, here. In 1920, nearly three decades before the creation of the CDC (here), the American Medical Association (AMA) adopted the following resolution: \u201cthat heroin be eliminated from all medicinal preparations and that it should not be administered, prescribed, nor dispensed; and that the importation, manufacture, and sale of heroin should be prohibited in the United States\u201d, here. This was one of many steps limiting the use of this drug.\n\nFour years later, the importation, possession, and use of heroin was effectively criminalized by the federal government, here. In 1930, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics was created to further enforce the provision of the Harrison Narcotics Act, here. Currently, the Drug Enforcement Agency considers heroin is a Schedule I drug, meaning that it has no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling.\n\nIt is therefore not possible for the CDC, a federal government agency, to have supported the use of heroin given that the agency was created decades after federal law deemed the drug as dangerous.\n\nThe advertisement poster for asbestos is also real. The ad reads, \u201cLet this magic mineral, asbestos, protect the buildings on your farm!\u201d On the bottom right corner is a company logo reading \u201cJM\u201d for Johns Manville, a manufacturer of insulation and roofing materials involved in a series of product-liability lawsuits over the harmful health effects of asbestos (see more about this here). The Asbestos Institute, (accredited by the EPA and Cal-OSHA, according to its website, here), dates the advertisement to 1937 (here).\n\nIn its \"History and Heritage\" tab, Johns Manville\u2019s website recognizes the \u201cadvent and demise of the \u2018miracle mineral\u2019\u2014asbestos\u201d, here. Asbestos has been referred to as the \"magic mineral\" due to its importance as an industrial resource, see here. By the mid-20th century, scientists and government agencies had collected considerable data on the effects of exposure to asbestos. By the 1960s, evidence was mounting that exposure to asbestos was dangerous (though it continued to be used in some ways until up to 1970), see here.\n\nIn 1971, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, under the CDC, developed the first document describing the harmful effects of asbestos, here. It is therefore false that the CDC supported the use of asbestos, which it recognized as harmful nearly fifty years ago.\n\nFalse: Although in the U.S. the use of certain harmful products has been historically promoted, it is false that the CDC actively supported their use", "lang": "en"}
