A lioness and her cub were walking but the heat was excessive and the puppy was in great distress walking. The elephant realized that his cub would die and carried him to a pool of water alongside his mother\u201d. Let\u2019s try to verify the authenticity of the image and also check how real the story described in the post is.\n\nClaim: The image of an Elephant carrying a lion cub with its mother walking by it is considered as the best photo of the century.

The picture of the elephant was taken in 2005 at Kruger National Park, South Africa. In the collage below, the original elephant photograph is on the left and the photoshopped image showing the elephant carrying a lion cub is on the right.\n\nThe original picture of the lion cub was taken at the \u2018Werribee Open Range Zoo\u2019 in Australia.\n\nThe picture of the lion(described as the cub\u2019s mother in the story) was found in a blog written by Adam Bannister.\n\nTo sum it up, the photo of a benevolent elephant carrying a lion cub with its mother walking by it is a photoshopped one.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE Lite series.", "lang": "en"}
