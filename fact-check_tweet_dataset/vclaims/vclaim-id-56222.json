A spokesperson for the company confirmed that the schedule was not real.\n\nFeaturing the logos of Walmart and its wholesale subsidiary Sam\u2019s Club, the image masquerades as an official announcement, saying, \u201cDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective immediately Walmart is adopting a staggered shopping schedule.\u201d\n\nThe alleged schedule designates Monday for those ages 66 or older, Tuesday for those 56 to 65, Wednesday for those 46 to 55, Thursday for those 36 to 45, Friday for those 25 to 35 and Saturdays for those 24 or younger.
