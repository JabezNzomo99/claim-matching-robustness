Taiwan Shot Down Chinese Fighter Jet? Taiwan Def Ministry Says No\n\nFirstly, Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry said that the claim doing the rounds is nothing but \u201cfake news\u201d. In response to rumors online that claim a Chinese Su-35 fighter jet had been shot down by Taiwan air defense systems, #ROCAirForce would like to categorically state this is fake news. We urge netizens to not spread it and strongly condemn this malicious act. \u2014 \u00e5\u009c\u008b\u00e9\u0098\u00b2\u00e9\u0083\u00a8 Ministry of National Defense, R.O.C. (@MoNDefense) September 4, 2020 Further, a statement released by Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry read: \u201cIn response to the Internet spread of \"Taiwan shot down a CCP SU-35 aircraft?\" The Air Force Command solemnly refuted this (4) day that this is false information, false information, and completely untrue.\u201d Soon after, several OSINT experts pointed out that the video could be from Guilin in China which is nearly 1,000 km away from Taiwan. A \u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00a8\u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00b3 jet of PLAAF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2nd Air Division has creased near Guilin in Guangxi due to unidentified reasons.\n\nType is not clear but 2nd Air Div is known to operate J-10B/C. \u2014 The Wolfpack\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u008e (@TheWolfpackIN) September 4, 2020 The Chinese jet has most likely crashed in China's Guangxi province in the vicinity of Guilin city. That is around 1,000 km away from Taiwan pic.twitter.com/aSfczOiW7W \u2014 Faytuks News \u00ce\u0094 (@Faytuks) September 4, 2020 We came across another video that mentioned that the visuals show the plane crash. The tweet, when translated to English, reads: \u201cIn Guilin, Guangxi (over the 18th middle), the plane fell.\u201d Now, we got in touch with an OSINT expert with Twitter handle @Faytuks who said that the video has been geolocated by someone at OSINT\u2019s discord sever. The location shared by the handle is: \u2018Guilin No. 18 Middle School.\u2019 We searched for the location on Google Maps and this is what it looks like: News Channels Use Old Images to Show PLA Soldiers Killed in Galwan While the said location does not have a street view, we tried to compare geographical features of this location with what is seen in one of the videos.\n\nThe running track is in the exact same shape in both the visuals. The intersection of the curve of the running track with that of the straight line is the same (highlighted in blue). The length of the straight line looks visually same as well. On looking carefully, one can see a white floor-like structure at the end of the straight line of the track (highlighted in yellow). This structure is surrounded by grass in both the visuals. In the video tweeted by one of the users, an empty space can be seen near the track. A similar space can be seen on the said location on Google Maps. 3. THE GREENS AROUND THE TRACK If you notice carefully, not only are the track and the white space in the same alignment, even the trees/ green spaces are laid out in the same way. Now, this running track has a set of steps placed along with it. Since the Google Map image is not extremely clear, The Quint cannot ascertain if the location shows \u2018steps\u2019. However, one can see that the structure has two different rows that possibly are at different levels. While an official statement from the Chinese government on the said incident is yet to come and the cause of the crash remains unknown, from the above information it seems the crash took place in China and not Taiwan. The visual comparisons shown above prove that the crash happened somewhere near the Guilin No 18 Middle School.", "lang": "en"}
