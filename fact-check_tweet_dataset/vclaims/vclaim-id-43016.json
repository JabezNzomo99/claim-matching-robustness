Also, it was mentioned that the American government has declared \u201819 February\u2019 as the \u2018World Chhatrapati Day\u2019. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: American government has printed the image of Shivaji on USD 100 note. Also, it has declared \u201819 February\u2019 as the \u2018World Chhatrapati Day\u2019. Fact: The 100 USD note carries the image of Benjamin Franklin. The American government has never printed any other person\u2019s image on its 100 dollar currency note. And, there is no information regarding the declaration of \u201819 February\u2019 as the \u2018World Chhatrapati Day\u2019 by the American Government. Hence, the claim stands FALSE.\n\nWhen googled about the details of various currency notes published in America, the Currency Education Program\u2019s website uscurrency.gov was found in the search results. As per the information available on the website, the design of the American dollar has changed 4 times but all of them carried the image of Benjamin Franklin. So, the American government has never printed Shivaji\u2019s image on its country\u2019s currency note.\n\nThere are few websites which allow replacing the image on 100 USD note with an image of our choice. You can notice that one such 100$ note, with the Obama picture on it, has the same code as the one shared in the post. So the 100$ note with Chhatrapati Shivaji image could have also been created in a similar manner.\n\nAlso, when searched if the American government has declared \u201819 February\u2019 as the \u2018World Chhatrapati Day\u2019, no such news was found. Also, in a list of Commemorative Days observed in America, there is no mention of \u2018World Chhatrapati Day\u2019. So, the news is false. As per the Maharashtra government\u2019s holidays list, \u201819 February\u2019 is the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji.\n\nEarlier, when similar news about the American government printing the image of Ambedkar on their country\u2019s $ 100 note went viral, \u2018FACTLY\u2019 has debunked it and the article can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, the American government hasn\u2019t printed Shivaji\u2019s image on its 100$ note. Also, it hasn\u2019t declared \u201819 February\u2019 as \u2018World Chhatrapati Day.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
