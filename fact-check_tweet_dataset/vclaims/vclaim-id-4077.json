Comey had already lost his job.\n\nFirst of all, we should note that Comey, as FBI director, was in the unusual position of deciding what was classified and what was not. He was not consistent in how he labeled his memos, and as far as we know, no explanation has been given.\n\nHis first memo, about the briefing for Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, about salacious material in a then-secret dossier, was labeled \u201cSECRET\u201d and \u201cNOFORN\u201d (No dissemination to foreign nationals). \u201cI am not sure of the proper classification so have chosen SECRET,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPlease let me know of it should be higher or lower than that.\u201d\n\nIn his book \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d Comey defended giving the Feb. 14 memo to Dan Richman, a friend who is a professor at Columbia Law School: \u201cDan had been giving me legal advice since my firing. I told him I was going to send him one unclassified memo and I wanted him to share the substance of the memo \u2014 but not the memo itself \u2014 with a reporter.\u201d\n\nComey has said he gave four of the memos to three lawyers on his legal team. The exact memos have not been identified, but Comey personally redacted sensitive portions of one memo, the Wall Street Journal reported. But the FBI found \u201cdiplomatic sensitive\u201d phrasing in one or two of the memos, Comey told Baier, and so his legal team returned them.\n\nAs we noted, only three of the seven memos were originally labeled \u201cUNCLASSIFIED,\u201d so it\u2019s unclear how Comey could say he was \u201chighly confident\u201d that four were not classified. The Justice Department inspector general is conducting an investigation into the classification of the Comey memos, the Wall Street Journal reported. Comey told CNN that the inspector general is not examining whether he mishandled classified information, but \u201cwhether I complied with policy as I should in making the memos and in the way I stored them.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal said that after Comey was fired, the FBI upgraded one of the memos he deemed unclassified to \u201cCONFIDENTIAL,\u201d the lowest level of classification, though it is unclear which memo. The Hill newspaper reported in July 2017 that four of the memos were marked \u201cSECRET\u201d or \u201cCONFIDENTIAL,\u201d similar to what was released recently.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 29, 2019: The Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General, in a report that was largely critical of Comey, noted that the memo on the Feb. 14 meeting was not deemed to be classified. \u201cWe found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to members of the media,\u201d the report said.\n\nBut Trump cannot say that the memo regarding the Feb. 14 meeting \u2014 the one memo Comey specifically hoped would reach the news media \u2014 contained classified information. For whatever reason, Comey wrote it specifically so it would not be considered classified \u2014 and the FBI released it without a single redaction. Ergo, it is not classified. The president further tips this into Four Pinocchio territory by accusing Comey of committing a crime by releasing an unclassified memo.", "lang": "en"}
