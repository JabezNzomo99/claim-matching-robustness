At least \u00a3440,000 of the 2016/17 foreign aid budget was spent on China\u2019s museums and film and TV industries. Around \u00a3140,000 was spent on helping the Chinese TV and film sectors, and a further \u00a3300,000 on museums and cultural heritage.\n\nAn earlier version of the MailOnline story said \u201c\u00a314billion went to boost China\u2019s film industry\u201d which the Mail subsequently corrected.\n\nWe commit a portion of our national income to foreign aid\n\nThe UK government has a target to spend 0.7% of the UK\u2019s Gross National Income on overseas development aid each year. Gross National Income (GNI) is the UK\u2019s annual output of goods and services, plus any income we get from abroad.\n\nMost of that money is spent by the Department for International Development, but around a quarter is spent by other departments.\n\nLast year around \u00a346 million was spent from the cross-governmental Prosperity Fund, which is where the money for Chinese film, TV and museums came from.\n\nLast year around \u00a3440,000 was spent on the Chinese film, TV and museum sectors\n\nIn 2016/17, the latest year we have data for, around \u00a381,000 was spent on a project \u201cdesigned to draw upon the expertise of UK TV professionals so that the Chinese TV sector and relevant Chinese authorities learn a range of new skills.\u201d A further \u00a362,000 was spent on \u201cenhancing UK-China collaborations particularly in areas such as co-productions and film exports.\u201d\n\nAs for museums, \u00a3112,000 was spent on \u201cdeveloping China\u2019s museum infrastructure\u201d, a further \u00a382,000 on \u201cdeveloping curatorial and business skills in China\u2019s museum sector\u201d and another \u00a3103,000 for \u201cbuilding capacity and supporting policy in china's cultural heritage sector.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s a total of around \u00a3140,000 on TV and film and \u00a3300,000 on museums and cultural heritage. The total budgeted for these projects was slightly higher, totalling \u00a3450,000, but the Foreign Office say \u00a3440,000 was spent on these projects in the 2016/17 financial year.\n\nThe Prosperity Fund focuses on delivering aid to middle income countries, and says its primary purpose is \u201cto remove barriers to economic growth in order to reduce poverty.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
