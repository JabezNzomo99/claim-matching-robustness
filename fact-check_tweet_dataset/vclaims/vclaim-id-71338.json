In the clip, the man can be heard warning the Muslim community about a \u2018sinister plot\u2019 of the Indian government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to kill a section of the population by injecting a vaccine imported from the United States of America. He claims that the government will decide who will live and who won\u2019t. It proclaims that the attack will take place in a month or so.\n\n\u201cThey will inject this vaccine in the garb of saving lives from coronavirus. Whoever takes the vaccine will die. The medicine will come from America, Modi is getting it from Trump. You see this and share everywhere,\u201d concludes the man while urging people to spread the word.

With a keyword search on Google, Alt News found a visually similar image featuring Malaysian State Sabah\u2019s Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal and China\u2019s Kota Kinabalu consul-general Liang Caide along with the medical equipment donated by China. It was published by Malaysian newspaper The Star on March 29, 2020.\n\nAccording to the report, the Sabah government had initiated a fundraising drive for China when the country was battling coronavirus in February to assist the country. \u201cChina\u2019s Kota Kinabalu consul-general, Liang Caide, returned the favour on behalf of his government with thousands of boxes of face masks, protective suits, goggles, thermometers and others,\u201d reported the media outlet on March 29, 2020. These images depict the first batch of the consignment that was delivered to Sabah as China reciprocated Malaysia\u2019s goodwill gesture.\n\nWe will fact-check all the four images separately and establish that all of them belong to the consignment of medical equipment delivered by China to Malaysia\u2019s Sabah state.\n\nThe first image shows a group of people including the Sabah\u2019s Chief Minister and China\u2019s Kota Kinabalu consul-general holding a banner which reads, \u201cWE ARE BROTHERS, FIGHTING TOGETHER.\u201d In the comparison posted below, the image on the left is the one circulating on WhatsApp whereas, on the right is an image published along with a news article reporting the event. We have matched the individuals seen in both the photos to establish that it is the same event.\n\nThe second viral image is of a man wearing a mask and holding a box in his hands.\n\nThe same man holding a box at the airport in Sabah was found in a different image that was published in a video report (at 33 seconds) by The Star.\n\nWith a keyword search on Twitter, we found a visually similar image tweeted by the State Information department of Sabah on March 29.\n\nThe fourth image shows a group of men, wearing red jackets and pants, getting down from a airplane.\n\nWe could not trace the fourth image on the internet, however, we found that these man dressed in red jackets and tracks can be seen in the video (at 13 seconds) posted below. The video was tweeted on March 29 with the caption, \u201cDozens of boxes of facemasks from China arrived in Sabah.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, a dangerous audio clip warning the Muslim community about a \u2018sinister plot\u2019 of the Indian government to \u2018poison\u2019 them in the garb of coronavirus vaccine was shared along with the images of medical aid received by Malaysia\u2019s Sabah state from the Chinese government.\n\nFurthermore, a vaccine for coronavirus is yet to be developed and trials are underway. In the past as well, we have observed misinformation promoting anti-vaccination propaganda. In 2018, rumours were circulated, especially in the Muslim community, linking the Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine with RSS and BJP, and how there\u2019s a conspiracy to hurt the Muslim community by manipulating vaccines. Alt News Science had debunked the rumour at length in this article.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India is more than 3,700 and close to 100 deaths have so far been reported. The government has imposed a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services to tackle the pandemic. Globally, more than 12 lakh confirmed cases and close to 64,000 deaths have been reported. There is a growing sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a pandemic, can take lives.
