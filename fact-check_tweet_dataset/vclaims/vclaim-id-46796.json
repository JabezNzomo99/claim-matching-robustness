The withdrawal, some have noted, largely abandoned the U.S.\u2019s Kurdish allies in the region.\n\nA viral image, shared more than 700 times, allegedly depicts a Syria boy wrapped in a red-and-white blanked sleeping between the graves of his parents. The Facebook post uses the image to criticize supporters of President Donald Trump, presumably for the president\u2019s decision to withdrawal those troops.\n\n\u201cWhy would any Trump supporters calling themselves Christians ever bother going to church when they are aiding and abetting treason, genocide, mass murder, and ethnic cleansing, unless it\u2019s to ask for forgiveness or it\u2019s all perfectly ok with Republican Jesus!\u201d reads the caption.\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the photograph does not, in fact, show what the Facebook post claims. The image, taken by Saudi photographer Abdul Aziz al-Otaibi in Saudi Arabia, is actually a staged photo from a 2014 art project. Al-Otaibi posted the photo on his Instagram Jan. 7, 2014.\n\n\u201cI had the idea to make a project whereby I show in pictures how the love of a child for his parents is irreplaceable,\u201d al-Otaibi told Dutch journalist Harald Doornbos in 2014. \u201cOf course I would never ever put a child between two real graves.\u201d\n\nThe child in the photograph is his nephew, who is not an orphan, and the grave were simply piles of stones, according to al-Otaibi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true at all that my picture has anything to do with Syria,\u201d said al-Otaibi. \u201cI am really shocked how people have twisted my picture.\u201d\n\nThe claim that the picture shows a boy lying between his parents\u2019 graves in Syria originated with Twitter user @americanbad, who tweeted it out with a false caption in 2014, according to India Today.", "lang": "en"}
