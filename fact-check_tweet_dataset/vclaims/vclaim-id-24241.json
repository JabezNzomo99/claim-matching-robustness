Its provision prohibiting the publication of surveys affecting national candidates 15 days before elections and seven days for local candidates was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2001.\n\nThe high court said the provision imposes prior restraint on and is a direct suppression of free of expression.\n\nIn keeping with the Fair Elections Act, the Commission on Elections issued on Jan. 30 Resolution 10488 permitting the publication of election surveys in Monday\u2019s elections along with the following information:\n\u2022 Name of the person, candidate, party or organization that commissioned, paid for or subscribed to the survey\n\u2022 Name of the person, polling firm or survey organization who conducted the survey\n\u2022 Period during which the survey was conducted, the methodology used, including the number of individual respondents and the areas from which they were selected, and the specific questions asked\n\u2022 Margin of error of the survey, and the margin of error of each question with a margin of error greater than that of the survey\n\u2022 Mailing address and telephone number where the survey sponsor can be contacted\n\nFormer communications assistant secretary Uson, now AA-Kasosyo Party nominee, posted in her Facebook page a screenshot of a poll supposedly ranking the least-liked senatorial candidates.\n\nThe poll is informal and not scientific.\n\nIt asked respondents through a Facebook poll which candidates they disliked the most. Only members of the group where the poll was posted could vote, their options limited to only 30 of the 62 senatorial candidates approved by the Commission on Elections.\n\nGadon\u2019s post got over 6,000 reactions, 1,000 comments and 2,000 shares; Uson\u2019s over 18,000 reactions, 2,500 comments and 4,000 shares,\n\nCommission on Elections.
