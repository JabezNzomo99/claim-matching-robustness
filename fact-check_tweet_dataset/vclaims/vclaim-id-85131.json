He made a more nuanced case for the auto companies refusing a government bailout and instead going through a managed bankruptcy. The companies ended up going through a managed bankruptcy \u2013 after getting nearly $80 billion in loans and other assistance from the Bush and Obama administrations. So Romney\u2019s course was half-taken.\n\nNow, Clinton is trying to suggest Trump was heartless about the auto industry\u2019s plight, as well. Does she have a case? Our friends at FactCheck.org have highlighted this attack, but we thought it was important to take our own look.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t just throw the money at the auto companies,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou have to get concessions, whether it is in bankruptcy or not in bankruptcy. And bankruptcy is not the worst thing. You would make a much better deal if they threw it into a chapter and they did DIP financing,\u201d referring to debtor-in-possession financing. DIP financing, which places new debt ahead of existing debts, is what the U.S. government provided to Chrysler and General Motors when they went through their managed bankruptcies. (Ford did not go through bankruptcy.)\n\nThe second statement was Trump speaking to the CBS Morning News on March 6, 2009: \u201cThe question is whether or not we should do it or let them just go bankrupt, let them negotiate from bankruptcy, which is really what should happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have let it go, and rebuild itself, through the free enterprise system,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou could have let it go bankrupt, frankly, and rebuild itself, and a lot of people think that\u2019s the way it should have happened. Or you could have done it the way it went. I could have done it either way. Either way would have been acceptable. I think you would have wound up in the same place.\u201d\n\nThis is where Clinton gets her \u201clet it go\u201d line. She makes it sound like that\u2019s what Trump said at the time\u2014 when she was casting votes as a senator to support the auto industry. But actually that statement was made years later \u2014 and Trump is saying he could have supported any option.\n\nOften, Trump would tout his idea that the companies should pursue a bankruptcy route, using DIP financing. As he put it to Van Susteren: \u201cI would really say, and I\u2019ve used it over the years \u2014 not personally, but I\u2019ve used it for different companies \u2014 you throw it into a chapter, you negotiate your deal, you make some new deals, you keep some deals the way they are, and you just make it better. You make it work.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, this was similar to Romney\u2019s position at the time. Many independent analysts have concluded this would not have worked in late 2008, simply because the credit markets were so frozen that a bankruptcy was not a viable option. But Trump also coupled his support of a bankruptcy option with strong expressions of support for some sort of government action.\n\nThe record is clear that Trump in 2008 was supportive of rescuing the auto industry, saying the government should do everything it could to save it: \u201cYou just can\u2019t lose Chrysler, you can\u2019t lose Ford, and you can\u2019t lose General Motors.\u201d He touted DIP financing, but he was relatively agnostic about the preferred path.", "lang": "en"}
