We found other instances of the same story elsewhere, too.\n\nThe fake story said the Food and Drug Administration was issuing a warning about rodents being sold as chicken wings after several shipping containers of rat meat were impounded coming into San Francisco from China.\n\nAn official-sounding statement from the FDA warned that the rat meat coming into the United States was filtering into the food system to deal with a shortage of poultry leading up to the National Football League\u2019s main event.\n\nThe story warned that Americans should be vigilant about what they are eating, because it\u2019s supposedly hard to tell the difference between rat meat and chicken wings. We\u2019d think the substitution would be easy to spot, but apparently rat is most often caught masquerading as lamb.\n\nAnd while some east Asian cultures have been known to consume rat meat or pass it off as something else, we could find no reports of rodent flesh being impounded in San Francisco by the ton in 2016, 2017 or any other year.\n\nThe UrbanImageMagazine.com post cited as its source a Feb. 6, 2016, story from WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a known peddler of fake articles. The site admits as much in its disclaimer, referring to \"the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\"\n\nThe original story posted a day before the Super Bowl was played on Feb. 7, 2016, as a joke \"warning\" people of counterfeit chicken wings.\n\nWe contacted UrbanImageMagazine.com to ask if they knew the story was fake, but didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nBut we smell a rat, all right, and it\u2019s the content of this story. We rate it Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
