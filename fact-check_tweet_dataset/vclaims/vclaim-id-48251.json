The original video has since been removed from YouTube for violating the platform\u2019s community standards. However, the full-length video, as well as shorter clips, still continue to circulate on other social media platforms such as Facebook, and have received more than a million views.\n\nOne of the primary scientific claims made by Erickson and Massihi is that COVID-19 is similar to the flu in terms of its spread and mortality. Pointing to data from COVID-19 testing in their clinics, Erickson said that they had conducted 5,213 tests and found 340 positive results, or approximately 6.5% positive results. He then extrapolated this percentage of positive results to estimate COVID-19 incidence in the entire population of the state of California, and concluded that \u201cthis equates to about 4.7 million cases throughout the state of California\u201d. With 1,227 COVID-19 deaths reported in California, this means that people \u201chave a 0.03[%] chance of dying from [COVID-19] in the state of California,\u201d claimed Erickson. Flu mortality has been estimated at 0.1%.\n\nSeveral scientists and physicians have criticized the statistical analysis that Erickson and Massihi presented for using a non-random sample of the population, pointing out that patients who present at emergency rooms for COVID-19 testing already suspect that they are ill. This means that the test-positive rate is likely higher among these patients than it would be among the general population. As Carl Bergstrom, professor of biology at the University of Washington explained on Twitter:\n\nUsing the test-positive rate as a substitute for incidence, as Erickson did, overestimates the number of infections in the population. This makes the mortality rate appear much smaller than it actually is, since infection fatality rate is determined by the number of deaths divided by the number of infections\u2014the larger the denominator, which in this case is the number of infections, the smaller the mortality rate.\n\nThe infection fatality rate, which includes both confirmed and undetected cases, for COVID-19 has been estimated to be about 0.66%, based on a research study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases[1], which is about 20 times Erickson\u2019s estimate. As we can see by comparing these values, Erickson\u2019s analysis greatly underestimates the infection mortality rate of COVID-19.\n\nScientists and physicians have presented several analogies to highlight the fundamental problem with Erickson\u2019s analysis:\n\nAnother scientific claim made by the duo is that sheltering in place would lead to a weakening of the immune system, because this would limit exposure to \u201cnormal bacteria and normal flora\u201d. While it is correct that healthy development of the immune system requires exposure to microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and viruses, sheltering in place would not minimize exposure to microorganisms to the extent of causing immune dysfunction.\n\nAs Steve Lee, associate professor at Loma Linda University\u2019s School of Medicine, explained in a Facebook post, \u201cUnless you live inside a bubble, your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air.\u201d\n\nJennifer Kasten, assistant professor of pathology and cardiology at the University of Cincinnati, also refuted this claim in a Facebook post. \u201cUnless you live inside an autoclave, your home is plenty pathogen-rich,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe world is absolutely teeming with microbes. You\u2019re coated in them, your house is coated in them, they enter your body with every breath you take and everything you eat. Your immune system is getting a perfectly adequate workout. You\u2019re just restricting your exposure to a handful of things (respiratory pathogens) for a very short period of time.\u201d\n\nErickson and Massihi do make a few cogent points in the video, specifically concerns that people might wait too long to seek medical care out of fear of contracting COVID-19, which could lead to adverse health outcomes. In addition, they mention the economic and psychological impacts of sheltering in place. However, their use of biased data and poor statistics to claim that COVID-19 is similar to the flu and therefore of little concern makes the video\u2019s main message inaccurate and misleading. These claims may cause individuals to fail to take proper measures to protect themselves and others from infection, undermining public health efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\nOn 27 April 2020, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine released a joint statement condemning both physicians, calling their statements \u201creckless and untested musings [\u2026] inconsistent with current science and epidemiology regarding COVID-19\u201d:\n\nRaywat Deonandan, epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Ottawa, also debunked the duo\u2019s claims in this blog post.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Verity et al.
