This headline is false. Additional allegations and speculation within in the articles that the posts reference are beyond the scope of this fact check.\n\nOmar is one of the first two Muslim women to serve in the U.S. Congress, along with Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D). For years Omar has been the target of unfounded claims by conservative commentators ( here ).\n\nOne instance of the claim that she is facing 40 years in prison ( here ) stems from a 2019 video by The Next News Network ( here ) in which the host references a supposed investigation into Omar by right-wing journalist David Steinberg.\n\nDavid Steinberg ( twitter.com/realDSteinberg ) of PJ Media allegedly uncovered evidence to demonstrate that from 2009 to 2017, Omar committed eight cases of perjury (lying under oath) in relation to her marriage history ( here ).\n\nThis fact check will not examine Steinberg\u2019s investigation. Omar, however, cannot \u201cface 40 years in prison and deportation\u201d if no legal proceedings are currently ongoing against her, making these claims and headlines inaccurate (\u201cIlhan Omar faces 40 years in prison and deportation after newly uncovered crimes\u201d). Reuters did not find any active or ongoing legal proceedings incriminating Omar at the time of this check. Omar\u2019s team confirmed to Reuters via email that she is not under any formal investigation.\n\nIn 2016, when Omar was running for the Minnesota state legislature, conservative bloggers began circulating rumors that Omar had wed her brother to help him acquire American citizenship. The same year, Omar issued a statement in which she clarified the timeline of her marital history and called the rumors \u201cbaseless\u201d, \u201cfalse and ridiculous\u201d ( here ).\n\nThese remarks resurfaced in October 2019, when President Donald Trump called Omar an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist\u201d during a rally in Minneapolis. The President also promoted debunked claims about Omar and her family in the speech ( here ).\n\nLast year, Minnesota State Rep. Steve Drazkowski, a conservative, called for the opening of an ethics investigation and the removal of security clearance for Omar, for allegedly having \u201cbeen found guilty of campaign finance abuses by the Minnesota Campaign Finance Board (CFB)\u201d and for being possibly \u201cguilty of federal tax fraud, federal immigration fraud, federal student loan fraud, perjury, and bigamy\u201d ( here ).\n\nIt is true that in June 2019, Minnesota\u2019s CFB found that Omar filed \u201ctax returns stating she was married to one man when, in fact, she was married to another,\u201d according to CBS Local, \u201camid an investigation into allegations of misuse of campaign funds.\u201d ( here )\n\nOmar later agreed to repay thousands in a fine and back taxes over the discrepancies in her filings ( here ). A spokesperson for Omar\u2019s campaign gave a statement at the time that said, \u201cAll of Rep. Omar\u2019s tax filings are fully compliant with all applicable tax law.\u201d ( here )\n\nAt the time, Business Insider reported that despite Drazkowski\u2019s claims, no hard evidence was presented to verify marriage fraud, despite \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in her marriage history ( here ). The New York Times addressed the claim surrounding Omar\u2019s marriage timeline after President Trump said, \u201cWell, there is a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother. I know nothing about it.\u201c ( here )\n\nFalse headline. Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar is not under investigation, nor facing formal charges, meaning she cannot be facing \u201c40 years in prison and deportation\u201d.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
