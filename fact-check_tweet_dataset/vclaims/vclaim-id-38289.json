The story has since been removed from Reddit, but it continues to circulate on Facebook in posts that do not include the context that it is a work of fiction.\n\nThe posting guidelines for the horror fiction subreddit also might have contributed to the perception that the story is real. The guidelines state: \u201cRemember: everything is true here, even if it\u2019s not. Do not insinuate or flat out say that your story or any other story on r/nosleep is or may be fictional.\u201d\n\nBut beyond the clear fictional origin of this claim, the science also doesn\u2019t hold up under scrutiny. Countless laboratories from the U.S. and at least 150 other countries that have reported cases of COVID-19 have independently confirmed that the causal agent is the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus[1]. Several new viruses capable of infecting humans emerge every single year[2], so the emergence of this virus is not unusual or unexpected. And even though a pandemic spread is rare, it is most certainly not uncommon[3], not even before the invention of flight and the prevalence of international travel. Therefore, any suggestion that the current outbreak could only have happened via a man-made contagion is false.\n\nIn addition, SARS-CoV-2 doesn\u2019t contain any of the obvious molecular signatures left behind when a virus or other microbes are manipulated in the laboratory, and its genome reveals a clear evolutionary connection to previously identified coronaviruses. A study published in the journal Nature on 17 March 2020 reported that \u201cOur analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus\u201d[4].\n\nHealth Feedback published several related reviews demonstrating that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not lab-created here, here, and here.\n\nSnopes also covered this claim in a 20 February 2020 article, labeling the story \u201cFalse.\u201d\n\nSeveral competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain where the novel coronavirus actually came from. Health Feedback investigated the three most widespread origin stories for the novel coronavirus (engineered, lab-leak or natural infection), and examined the evidence for or against each proposed hypothesis in this Insight article.\n\u2022 None A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\n\u2022 None .
