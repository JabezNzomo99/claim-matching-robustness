It includes transcripts of its interviews with the candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nWhat appeared to be an excerpt of that interview soon showed up on Facebook.\n\nThe post is a screenshot of a tweet that appears to show a portion of the New York Times transcript of one of Biden\u2019s answers. It reads:\n\n\"By the way, and that\u2019s what some of those Bernie people don\u2019t get. You have to get the center, too. It\u2019s, I was eating a corn dog the other day, this is like a corn dog, with some mustard. When you get to the middle, it\u2019s hard and tough and dry [CHUCKLES], but you have to eat that, too. You have to eat that to finish it. But it\u2019s hard.\"\n\n\"Sir, are you talking about eating a [wooden] stick?\"\n\nPeople who shared it on Facebook seemed shocked.\n\n\"Uhh,\" wrote the Facebook account that posted the image, which was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nYou can read the interview transcript yourself; Biden didn\u2019t say that. He didn\u2019t talk about corn dogs at all, nor \"Bernie people\" or even \"centers,\" not counting a reference to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nThe fake Biden interview appears to be a joke. But like a game of telephone, not everyone is getting it.\n\n\"Dementia,\" wrote one person commenting on the Facebook post.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
