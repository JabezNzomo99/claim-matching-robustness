A Starbucks spokesperson confirmed the claim is false.\n\nThere have been growing calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d since George Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody in late May. While there is no universal definition of what defunding the police looks like, those in favor of it typically call to divert some, if not all, funds from police departments to other areas of the community such as schools and health care, according to PBS.\n\nThe image being shared claims the popular coffee chain Starbucks has publicly supported the movement, saying, \u201cStarbucks says Defund the Police. Let\u2019s defund Starbucks. Ask all friends and family not to be Starbucks patrons. Dunkin coffee is just as good!\u201d\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Starbucks has endorsed the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement. The term \u201cdefund the police,\u201d or any similar variation, does not appear in any press releases or articles published on the company\u2019s website. Nor do any messages of support for the movement appear on Starbucks\u2019 verified Twitter and Facebook accounts.\n\nA spokesperson for Starbucks also confirmed to the DCNF that the claim made in the post is inaccurate.

For example, the company sponsors the \u201cCoffee with a Cop\u201d program in which police officers sit down for a cup of coffee with other Starbucks patrons \u201cto help build community through conversation, understanding and empathy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Starbucks, we have deep appreciation for the police officers who are committed to keeping our communities safe,\u201d reads the opening line of an article about the program on Starbucks\u2019 website.\n\nStarbucks also issued an apology to police officers in Tempe, Arizona, after a group of officers were asked to leave a Starbucks for making a customer feel \u201cuncomfortable\u201d in July 2019, according to ABC News. In the apology, the company states their appreciation for the Tempe Police Department and refers to the incident as \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, the coffee company has publicly supported the Black Lives Matter movement, sharing several tweets, as well as posts, on the Starbucks website that detail action the company is taking to fight racial inequality.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
