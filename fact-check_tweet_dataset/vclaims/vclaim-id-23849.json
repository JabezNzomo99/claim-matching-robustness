He is a teacher at Valsad\u2019s RM VM School. Share this so much that the teacher and the school are closed. A viral video makes a lot of difference and results in proceedings. Those who can\u2019t sympathize please keep your mouth (typing) closed.)\u201d \n\n\n\nThe video has been circulating on Facebook with the above-mentioned claim.\n\nA reverse image search on Google led Alt News to a February 10, 2018Dainik Bhaskar article which carried the same video. The article said that the incident occurred in Raipur, Chhattisgarh. The man was beating up the girl as part of an \u2018exorcism\u2019 and that the whole event took place in the presence of the girl\u2019s family.\n\n\n\nA subsequent report Dainik Bhaskar on February 11, 2018, said that the incident took place in Raipur\u2019s Santoshi Nagar. The man who performed the \u2018exorcism\u2019 was a pastor named Dinesh Sahu. He hails from a town named Chipli in Kabirdham district. Sahu had been taking advantage of people\u2019s superstitions by using torturous methods to help those who believed to be possessed by ghosts. His methods had angered the residents of his town therefore, he eventually fled to Santoshi Nagar. The police arrested Sahu after the video of him beating the minor girl went viral. According to Dainik Bhaskar, the incident had occurred four months prior to when he was arrested.\n\nThe case was also reported by Haribhoomi, according to which, Sahu was arrested by SDOP Ritesh Choudhari and TI Rajkumar Sori under section 151.\n\nIn conclusion, the man in the video, assaulting the girl, is not a teacher of Valsad\u2019s RM VM school but a pastor in Chhattisgarh trying to perform an \u2018exorcism\u2019.\n\nSimilar misinformation has been circulated in the past to target the Gujarat-based school. Different videos like a child abuse video from Syria, another from Egypt and one from Delhi had been shared claiming that they show RM VM school teachers assaulting students. Similar claims targeting other schools in Valsad have also circulated online.", "lang": "en"}
