( here ; here ). Other iterations of this post misattribute this quote to Joe Biden.\n\nMany posts on Twitter attribute the quote to Trump and claim the President made this remark on March 18, 2020 during a press conference at the White House on the coronavirus ( here , here ).\n\nTrump did not say this during a press conference on March 18, 2020. He made mention of death only once during the address, when referring to the possibility of an airline industry bailout:\n\n\u201cThe best year they\u2019ve ever had by far, to boom. One day, empty, because of what we have to do to win this war. Or we would have a level of death like people haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d\n\nThe precise moment of the exchange is visible youtu.be/SSbVZT--lzk?t=6797 .\n\nA quick Twitter search shows hundreds of results attributing \u201cpeople are dying who have never died before\u201d to Trump, making it difficult to verify the first misattribution. The earliest Tweet Reuters was able to find with this precise quote, stems from 2009 ( here ). It is unrelated to Trump and attributes the quote to Ernest Hemingway.\n\nIn two biographies of Ernest Hemingway, his use of this phrase is indeed mentioned, although it is not clear whether Hemingway himself coined the phrase. ( here ; here ).\n\nOther social media posts that the quote to Trump alter the wording slightly to \u201cPeople are dying this year that never died before\u201d and \u201cMen are dying this year who have never died before\u201d.\n\nFalse: there is no evidence that shows that Trump said \u201cpeople are dying who have never died before\u201d, either in relation to the coronavirus outbreak or earlier. The late writer Ernest Hemingway is documented as having used the phrase.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
