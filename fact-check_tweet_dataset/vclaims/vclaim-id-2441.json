(See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: In his own words: Duterte's drug war, so far )\n\nResponding to the question, the DDB Chair veered off course and brought up the issue of the Marcos ill-gotten wealth, and then the challenges with modernizing the armed forces.\n\nOf the latter, he said:\n\nLike Duterte, who , including in his second State of the Nation Address, about procurement of goods and services for the military, Santiago is wrong. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Can the president order COA to bypass gov't bidding rules? ; )\n\nRepublic Act No. 9184, the law that governs public procurement, does not mandate that the government acquire just the \u201ccheapest\u201d goods and services.\n\nRather, the law has designed a competitive public bidding process to ensure that the goods and services acquired are of the best possible quality and cost, through several layers of safeguards.\n\nFirst, the procurement process is initiated with the public being notified of bidding opportunities, to ensure transparency and increase the number of prospective bidders.\n\nThen, goods suppliers and service providers who want to participate in the bidding are evaluated for eligibility, through the sufficiency of their documentary submissions.\n\nNext, the financial components of qualified bids are evaluated, and ranked to determine the lowest bid.\n\nFinally, the statements and documents by the lowest bidder are verified and validated to ascertain if these comply with legal, financial and technical requirements of the bid.\n\nOnly then is the contract awarded, based on the law.\n\nDuterte signed July 17 Executive Order No. 34, which among others simplifies the approval of government contracts entered into through procurement methods besides the competitive public bidding mandate by the law.\n\nThese methods include limited source bidding or selective bidding, direct contracting, repeat order, shopping and negotiated procurement.\n\nYet, the Supreme Court, in an earlier case involving alternative procurement methods by the Commission on Elections, ruled in favor of a strong \u201ccompliance with the conditions provided in the (procurement law) and all the pertinent rules and procedures.\u201d\n\nGovernment Procurement Policy Board, Guidelines on the Establishment of Procurement Systems and Organizations Vol. 1\n\nGovernment Procurement Policy Board, Manual of Procedures for the Procurement of Goods and Services Vol. 2", "lang": "en"}
