Bush said in a 1992 interview, \u201cIf the American people ever find out what we have done, they will chase us down the streets and lynch us.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any credible record of Bush making the remark.\n\nBush died in November 2018 at the age of 94, according to the Washington Post. In recent days, social media users have again been sharing a quote, purportedly from the late president, that they claim dates back to 1992.\n\n\u201cIf the American people ever find out what we have done, they will chase us down the streets and lynch us,\u201d Bush allegedly said. (RELATED: Did Trump Fail To Put His Hand Over His Heart At Bush\u2019s Funeral?)\n\nMany iterations of the claim attempt to suggest that Bush made the seemingly self-incriminating comment in June 1992 to the late White House reporter Sarah McClendon in reference to the Iran-Contra Affair. The DCNF didn\u2019t find any instances of Bush making the remark in a collection of McClendon\u2019s reports and newsletters from June to December 1992.\n\nBrett McClendon, an archives assistant for the University Archives and Special Collections at the University of Texas at Tyler, told the DCNF that he \u201cwas unable to locate this quote in any form\u201d in Sarah McClendon\u2019s 1992 writings.\n\n\u201cIn her 1996 book \u2018Mr. President, Mr. President,\u2019 Sarah writes of George H.W. Bush, \u2018I wish he\u2019d give me an interview. There are still a couple of questions I\u2019d love for him to answer,'\u201d Brett McClendon said in an email. \u201cNote that she wrote this in 1996, four years after the alleged interview with President Bush supposedly took place. We do not have any record of such an interview in our collection here.\u201d\n\nNor does the alleged quote appear in textual archives from the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library, further adding to the attribution\u2019s dubiousness. Had he made the comment, it almost certainly would have been picked up by media outlets at the time, yet a Nexis search didn\u2019t turn up any matches, per PolitiFact.\n\nSnopes traced an iteration of the claim as far back as 1995, when someone posted an anecdote online citing Sarah McClendon in a 1995 interview on Tom Valentine\u2019s Radio Free America program.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
