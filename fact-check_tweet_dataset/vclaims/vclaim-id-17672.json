But the sign at Roosevelt Middle School in Oakland, California has never displayed that message, Cliff Hong, the school\u2019s principal, told FactCheck.org. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even used that sign in, like, two years,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Sasaki, spokesman for the Oakland Unified School District, said that, \u201cas a district, we don\u2019t put political messages on our signs.\u201d\n\nThe photo came from a website with a generator that allows users to put text on a picture of the school\u2019s sign. Over the last couple of years, Hong said, he\u2019s seen pictures of the sign circulating online with various messages on it, none of which had actually been posted outside of the school.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen a picture from an online generator spread misinformation. In 2015, we wrote about Islamophobic claims targeting Dearborn, Michigan, one of which included a fake message that had been typed onto a picture of a church sign.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.
