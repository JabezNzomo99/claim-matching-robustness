It does not call for the abolition of all immigration detention.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign recently released a 110-page document outlining policy recommendations agreed to by the Biden-Sanders unity task force, a collaborative effort between the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Politico reported. The document, which has been submitted to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Platform Committee ahead of next month\u2019s Democratic National Convention, covers six key areas: the economy, climate change, criminal justice reform, education, health care and immigration.\n\nDuring a news conference at the White House on Tuesday, Trump appeared to criticize many of the task force\u2019s recommendations, including those related to immigration. He claimed the task force proposed to \u201cabolish immigration detention. No more detention. You come in here illegally, no more detention,\u201d per the transcript.

While the document released by the task force calls for the elimination of for-profit detention centers, it does not call for the abolition of immigration detention all together. It proposes to \u201cend for-profit detention centers and ensure that any facility where migrants are being detained is held to the highest standards of care and guarantees the safety and dignity of families,\u201d according to the document.\n\nThe U.S. government detains tens of thousands of immigrants on average every day in detention centers across the country while they await determinations on their immigration statuses and, sometimes, deportations, according to NBC News. The detention facilities immigrants are held in include those operated by the federal government, contracted county jails and contracted private prison companies.\n\nThe Biden-Sanders task force recommends the use of immigration detention as a \u201clast resort\u201d and encourages the prioritization of \u201cinvestments in alternatives to detention, including proven community-based alternatives and non-profit case management programs.\u201d It also states that the detention of children \u201cshould be restricted to the shortest possible time, with their access to education and proper care ensured.\u201d\n\nNeither the White House nor the Biden campaign returned a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
