God Bless the USA!\"\n\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe image is authentic, but it\u2019s from 2004 when President George W. Bush attended the event.\n\nThe photo was taken by photographer Jonathan Ferrey. Its caption says, \"Air Force One takes off with U.S. President Geore W. Bush aboard after attending the NASCAR Nextel Cup Daytona 500 on Feb. 15, 2004, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Fla.\"\n\nSeveral commenters believed it showed President Trump\u2019s visit and the crowd during this year\u2019s race, and for good reason. George W. Bush is the only other president to attend the event.\n\nPresidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan attended the Pepsi 400, which is held at the Daytona International Speedway in the summer.\n\nLike Trump, the younger Bush served as the race\u2019s grand marshal and was also seeking re-election at the time of his visit.\n\nNevertheless, this photo is missing context: It\u2019s over 15 years old and two presidents removed from Trump. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
