Natalia Bryant 2003-2020\" and the BBC News logo. The article did not contain any body text.\n\nThe article was flagged by Facebook's Claim Check, a monitoring tool that detects dubious posts with the potential to go viral.\n\nThe facts: BBC did not report Natalia Bryant's death, nor did any other legitimate news sites.\n\nUpon clicking the video, a warning appears after a few seconds, reading, \"Warning: This video may show graphic content (18+) Share to continue watching.\"\n\nThe viewer is then prompted to click an \"uncover now\" button that leads to a pop-up window allowing them to share the video on Facebook with the hashtag \"#RIPNathaliaBryant (sic).\"\n\nThe video URL shows that it was posted on YouTube by the channel \"ashir mohamad\" on February 18. As of posting, the 37-second video had generated more than 480,000 views.\n\nNatalia herself did not create any social media posts about the claim and her mother Vanessa Bryant has not posted about her supposed death either.\n\nIn the same week, a false post claiming that Vanessa Bryant committed suicide in front of her children due to depression also made the rounds on Facebook. The post contained elements similar to the article that made the claim about Natalia Bryant's death.", "lang": "en"}
