A simple reverse image search on Google shows that the photos shared are not from Ayodhya, but from the Maratha Kranti Morcha that was held in Mumbai back in 2017. The first picture was carried by several news organisations including Mid-Day, and Amar Ujjala. The second photo has been carried several times by Loksatta \u2013 with attribution reading \u2018Archived Image\u2019 (translated). The third photo too has been carried by several news organisations including Deccan Chronicle and moneycontrol.com, and is from the Maratha Quota stir. The last picture appears to be from Jaipur, when members of the Rajput Karni Sena staged a gherao at the Vidhan Sabha in Jaipur demanding reservation for the Rajput community on 3 March 2017. The photo was carried by News18 Hindi on the same day. PHOTO OF POLICE HELPING OLD MAN IS FROM MAY 2018 Another photo that was viral with respect to the Dharm Sabha was one of a policeman helping out an old man clad in saffron. The photo was shared with the message: \u201c1992 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091c\u093f\u0928 \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u092e\u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094b \u092a\u0930 \u0917\u094b\u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u091a\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0925\u0940 \u0935\u094b \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0906\u091c \u0930\u093e\u092e\u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094b \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u0947\u0935\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u0917\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902\u0964 #\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c\u201d This translates to \u201cIn 1992, the police who opened fire on Ram Bhakts, the same police is helping out Ram Bhakts today. #Yogiraj\u201d However, a reverse image search showed that the photo was from 25 May 2018, and had been tweeted out by the UP Police, as part of their \u2018Elders First\u2019 campaign.

The VHP on Sunday held a \u2018Dharm Sabha\u2019 where they said they would not cede an \u201cinch of land\u201d for anything but a Ram temple, urging the state Sunni Waqf Board to withdraw its case over the disputed land. Meanwhile, reports suggest a possible introduction of a Bill by the Modi government in the Parliament\u2019s winter session that begins on 11 December.", "lang": "en"}
