It says:\n\nCovid-19 definitely does spread person to person and via surfaces. Covid-19 is caused by a virus and is potentially dangerous, although it\u2019s true that humans have plenty of harmless viruses in their bodies.\n\nThe virus that causes Covid-19, called SARS-CoV-2, does spread from person to person, through respiratory droplets released when an infected person sneezes, coughs, and talks. Close contact with an infected person is how the virus spreads.\n\nWe have evidence this is the case. Other coronaviruses that infect humans, such as SARS (of which there was an outbreak in 2002) and the common cold, also spread in this way.\n\nSocial distancing measures which reduce the number of person-to-person interactions have been proven to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nYou can catch Covid-19 from touching surfaces\n\nCovid-19 also spreads via surfaces. In general, other human coronaviruses (which we\u2019ve had longer to study) survive on objects for up to five days. Studies into SARS-CoV-2 have shown it can survive for between 8 and 72 hours on a surface depending on the material and environment.\n\nJust touching a surface that is contaminated with the virus is not enough to become infected\u2014the virus enters the body through membranes present in the nose, mouth, or eyes. The problem is that we touch these parts of ourselves all the time without noticing, which is why it\u2019s so important that you wash your hands with soap and water often, especially outside of your own home.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what the graphic means when it claims that viruses are \u201cdead material leaving healing cells\u201d.\n\nThere is some debate amongst scientists as to whether viruses are technically alive or not, because they need a host cell to replicate and can\u2019t do so themselves. Some argue this means that they are not alive as they can\u2019t reproduce unaided, but others disagree, saying that even though genetically they are very simple, they are still able to evolve.\n\nWhen viruses replicate in host cells, they take over the cell\u2019s mechanics to reproduce, and then leave. The host cell can\u2019t really be said to be healing when that happens, even though it may not have died. Some cells do respond to viral infection by dying.\n\nDo we have thousands of viruses inside our bodies?\n\nIt\u2019s true that humans contain a number of viruses that don\u2019t harm us, or are protecting the human body against bacteria. Many of these are bacteriophages\u2014a type of virus that infects bacteria. This is not the same as being infected with a virus that can cause a potentially dangerous disease, like Covid-19.\n\nThe text of the Facebook post also claims that masks decrease oxygen intake, increase carbon dioxide intake, increase toxin intake, and increase stress levels which negatively impacts the immune system.\n\nThe kind of face masks normally used by members of the public do not pose a threat to most people. We could not find any evidence that cloth face coverings and medical (sometimes called surgical) face masks reduce oxygen levels or increase carbon dioxide levels in the body.\n\nThe UK government says face coverings should not be worn by children under three, or those \u201cwho may find it difficult to manage them correctly\u201d, for example \u201cprimary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions\u201d.\n\nAsthma UK says that for some people with asthma, wearing a face covering could \u201cmake it feel harder to breathe\u201d and \u201cso if [they] are finding it hard, then don\u2019t wear one\u201d.\n\nThe post we\u2019re checking here could be referring to a specific type of mask, called an N95 respirator, which is used in healthcare settings in the US. These are also approved for use in the UK and the equivalent mask usually used here is called the FFP2. These types of masks can be worn for several hours in a row, but some research has shown that they can affect gas exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s true that face masks of all types can make some people feel claustrophobic. There\u2019s no evidence that masks weaken the immune system though.", "lang": "en"}
