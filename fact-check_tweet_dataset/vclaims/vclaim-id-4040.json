No, that's not exactly what happened. An old story from 2016 seems to have gone viral again, and that story mixes up two different other stories in turn to make something that is not quite true.\n\nAn article published on November 1, 2016 from Love This Pic titled \"Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna\" (archived here) went viral again in 2018. It opened:\n\nWe previously reported about the current tuna recall and the reason for the recall was supposedly a packing deviation by a facility not owned or operated by Bumble Bee that could result in contamination by spoilage or pathogens - if consumed this could lead to life-threatening illnesses... Now there are new reports a man was mixed into a batch of tuna! These have been new reports circulating today so we cannot verify them at this time, but here's what sites have been reporting:\n\nBumble Bee Foods and 2 employees were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna. Jos\u00e9 Melena was performing maintenance in a 35 foot long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant when coworkers loaded it with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and turned it on. Temperatures reached 270\u00b0 during a two-hour process to cook and sterilize the tuna. The body of Melena,62, was found when the oven was opened.\n\nThe 2016 article got two things correct but messed up the dates and locations:\n\u2022 A man was indeed cooked alive in an oven used by Bumble Bee to sterilize cans of tuna fish.\n\u2022 There was a recall of Bumble Bee tuna cans.\n\nBut the first event was an accident that happened in October 2012 for which Bumble Bee was forced to pay $6 million in damages:\n\nAnd the second event happened in 2016 and did not involve tuna packed at plant owned or operated by Bumble Bee.\n\nSo no tuna was ever sold that contained bits of a dead worker.
