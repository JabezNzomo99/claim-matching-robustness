The Secure and Succeed Act, sponsored by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), failed 39 to 60 in the Senate in February. The White House backed this proposal, which got 36 of 51 GOP votes and three Democratic votes, far short of passage. Three other immigration proposals, backed by broader mixes of Republicans and Democrats, each got more than 50 votes \u2014 enough to pass if there had not been a procedural vote requiring 60 votes.\n\nMiller also mentioned the \u201cFlores settlement\u201d from 1997. This legal agreement struck by President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration requires the federal government to release rather than detain undocumented immigrant children, first to their parents if possible, to other adult relatives if not, and to licensed programs willing to accept custody if no relatives are available. As a last resort, U.S. officials may place children in the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d setting available.\n\nA federal judge in California ruled in 2015 that the Flores settlement covered all children in immigration officials\u2019 custody, regardless of whether they were apprehended at the border alone or with family members. The judge\u2019s ruling also covered any accompanying parents. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed the latter part of the ruling and said the Flores settlement required only that children, not parents, be released. Therefore, the government is required to keep immigrant children and their parents together only for a limited time.\n\n\u201cSeparation happens only if officials find that the adult is falsely claiming to be the child\u2019s parent, or is a threat to the child, or is put into criminal proceedings,\u201d Lowry wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s the last that is operative here. The past practice had been to give a free pass to an adult who is part of a family unit. The new Trump policy is to prosecute all adults.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator Kaine has serious concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s policies that threaten to put kids in harm\u2019s way, including the separation of parents and children at the border, the widely reported failure to account for nearly 1,500 children who came to the U.S. as unaccompanied minors, and the lack of protections for kids in the U.S. whose parents are arrested or detained by immigration authorities,\u201d a Kaine representative said, adding later, \u201cHe was clearly listing facts about two separate Trump administration policies in his tweet, not conflating the two.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
