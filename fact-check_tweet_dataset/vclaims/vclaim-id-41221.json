This is false; on average, human activities emit in three to five days what Earth\u2019s volcanoes produce in a year, according to the United States Geological Survey.\n\nThis tenacious hoax has been shared since the early days of the internet: volcanic activity accounts for far greater amounts of carbon dioxide in the planet\u2019s atmosphere than human activity. One meme claims that \u201cone little burp\u201d from Mount Etna emitted 10,000 times more carbon dioxide than humankind in its entire existence. Another refers to an Indonesian volcano in order to make a similar point.\n\nBoth claims are false, yet the wider idea that they attempt to convey -- that concerns about human caused, or anthropogenic, carbon dioxide emissions are unwarranted since they pale in comparison to the natural carbon cycle -- continues to make the rounds on social media.\n\n\u201cThat cannot be right, I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re getting their numbers,\u201d Celina Suarez, Associate Professor of Geology at the University of Arkansas and a researcher for the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO), a group of 1,200 scientists from 55 countries aiming to better understand Earth\u2019s carbon cycle, told AFP.\n\nThis 2011 study from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), set out to settle precisely the question of carbon dioxide emissions from Earth\u2019s volcanoes vs human activities. The answer was unequivocal: \u201canthropogenic CO2 emissions dwarf global volcanic CO2 emissions,\u201d Terrance Gerlarch, the study\u2019s author, wrote.\n\nThe USGS published figures that allows for the comparison of specific volcano eruptions to global human carbon dioxide production. The 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens in the US state of Oregon vented about 10 million tons of CO2 in nine hours. It would take 3,500 of those eruptions to match humankind\u2019s carbon dioxide production from 2010 alone.\n\nOn October 1, 2019, the DCO released a summary of papers published after 10 years of research. Over the years studied they found, \u201cHumanity\u2019s annual carbon emissions through the burning of fossil fuels and forests, etc., are 40 to 100 times greater than all volcanic emissions.\u201d Here is an AFP story about the study.\n\nVolcanic emissions and other \u201cmagmatically active regions\u201d release an estimated 280 to 360 million tonnes of carbon per year, according to DCO research. In 2010 alone, humanity produced an estimated 35 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, according to the USGS study.\n\nSpecific information on gas emissions from natural sources can be found on this map designed in collaboration with the DCO.", "lang": "en"}
