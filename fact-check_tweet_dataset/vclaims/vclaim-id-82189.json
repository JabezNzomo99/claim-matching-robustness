Mike Lee (R-Utah), especially now that Rubio has announced a presidential run. At a recent event where the pair presented the plan, they addressed concerns over whether the proposal would hurt middle-class Americans. Rubio said on two occasions that the plan would instead help the majority of Americans \u2014 and that 90 percent of Americans would see a tax cut under their plan.\n\nIt is important to note that this is a working proposal, and there are provisions that yet remain to be fleshed out. But the claim is worth exploring. Critics of their plan say it appears to conflict with Rubio\u2019s middle-class message, and that the plan would disproportionately benefit the rich and hurt the poor.\n\nOne of the main provisions would consolidate the personal income tax into two brackets \u2014 15 percent and 35 percent. Depending on the interaction with other provisions, that could result in a break for some and a tax increase for others, as the current lowest bracket is 10 percent and the highest is 39.6 percent. It cuts taxes on investment income, eliminates double taxation for business income, and reduces the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from the current 35 percent.\n\nThe plan also eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax and most itemized deductions, except for a modified mortgage deduction and the deduction for charitable giving. The elimination of itemized deductions has come under criticism, as some argue it would get rid of breaks that benefit the middle class. It expands the child tax credit to $2,500 per child \u2014 the key pro-family provision that the authors said would get rid of the \u201cparent tax penalty.\u201d The credit is partially refundable up to the payroll taxes paid, so there is criticism that poorest families would not benefit from the expanded child tax credit.\n\nAccording to the right-leaning Tax Foundation, to whom the Rubio staff pointed us, the trade-offs in the plan ultimately would be balanced out by the personal tax credit, especially for lower-income taxpayers. The Tax Foundation found that under a fully refundable personal credit, taxpayers essentially would get $2,000 off their bill.\n\nCutting taxes for 90 percent of Americans does not mean that everyone would get the same percentage tax cut, as shown in the graphic. The 40 to 80 percent income decile, in particular, would see a much smaller cut than the rest. A refundable personal credit could take away all tax liability for the lowest deciles, since the average tax bill is about $2,100 or lower for people with adjusted incomes under $40,000.\n\nThe problem here is that the full refundability of the personal tax credit is not written in the current proposal. Aides for Lee and Rubio have told the Tax Foundation the credit would be refundable, and Lee\u2019s staff confirmed it as such to The Fact Checker. Some outlets have reported it would be refundable subject to a work requirement, but Lee\u2019s staff told us it would be refundable to everyone.\n\nA fully refundable personal credit also would be costly and add to the deficit. The refund, essentially, would be new spending since there is no such current program. Pomerleau did not have a specific calculation for the personal credit portion. The expanded child tax credit alone would cost about $170 billion a year in static and dynamic estimates, according to the Tax Foundation. (Their breakdown of economic impacts is available here, and shows the change in deficit would balance out after the first decade.)\n\nWe consulted the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, which calculated an earlier version of this proposal that Lee introduced in 2013. Under the 2013 plan, 61.5 percent of taxpayers will see a tax cut, and 12 percent will see a tax increase. The center found it would disproportionately help the rich, and raise taxes on poor families. The biggest difference between this analysis and the Tax Foundation\u2019s analysis is the refundable tax credit.\n\nThe bottom line is that this tax proposal is evolving, and there is no way to definitively prove or disprove Rubio\u2019s claim that more than 90 percent of Americans will see a tax cut. That surely sounds like a significant promise, yet staff for Lee and Rubio would not answer our question as to why such a critical component \u2014 full refundability \u2014 was not written into the proposal.\n\nA lot of vague promises are made on the presidential campaign trail. But when it comes to statements such as the ones highlighted here, it would be more responsible for Rubio to note that the figures are based on a provision that is not explicitly written into the proposal.", "lang": "en"}
