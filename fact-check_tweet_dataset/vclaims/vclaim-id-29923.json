It claims that British union flags were banned, Palestinian flags filled the conference hall and that working class white people were charged more to attend than non-white people.\n\nThere is no evidence that the union flag was banned from the Labour conference in 2019. The picture of Palestinian flags being waved (which features in the post) are from the 2018 Labour conference. We wrote about this last year.\n\nLabour did at one point offer a \u00a310 discount for black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) members to attend a regional conference in the East Midlands in 2018. However, these plans were scrapped, allegedly because Labour had been reported to the Equality and Human Rights Commission on grounds of discrimination. The EHRC told us it didn\u2019t ultimately take any action as the policy had apparently been reversed.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that this happened for the party\u2019s 2019 national conference.", "lang": "en"}
