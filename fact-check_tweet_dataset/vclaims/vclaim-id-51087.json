No, that's not true: The story was fabricated by a Canadian entertainment website that publishes fictional stories about bizarre crimes, weird sexual acts, and other made-up events. The photo accompanying the story was lifted from a completely different news story.\n\nThe claim originated from an article (archived here) published by World News Daily Report on December 11, 2019, under the title \"MALL SANTA ARRESTED FOR MAKING KIDS TOUCH AND LICK HIS ERECT PENIS COATED IN SUGAR AND PAINTED LIKE CANDY CANE.\" It opened:\n\nAn Arkansas mall Santa was arrested this week after allegedly enticing dozens of underage children to touch his genitals. Little Rock Police Officers responded to the vicinity of Park Plaza Mall for a report of an intoxicated man dressed in a Santa Claus outfit within the mall who was allegedly touching children in an inappropriate manner.

For example:\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a website spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often, their stories feature an image showing a random mugshot found in an online gallery or a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by various fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes worldnewsdailyreport.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
