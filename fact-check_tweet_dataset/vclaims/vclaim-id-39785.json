No, there is no proof: Donald's Trump's paternal grandfather Frederick Trump accumulated his initial wealth by owning restaurants and hotels in Seattle and the Yukon in his first decades after immigrating from Germany to the United States. While Gwenda Blair writes in her book \"Trumps: Three Generations That Built an Empire\" that the elder Trump's businesses apparently hosted prostitution, Blair also said \"I wouldn't call him a pimp.\" Trump's father Fred Trump was detained at a KKK protest in the Queens borough of New York City, but he was released without charges, according to a New York Times clipping from June 1927. The report did not say he was a member of the KKK and there is no evidence otherwise that he was in the group. As for tax evasion by the grandfather, the article in question offers no details or sourcing.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) where it was published by American Herald Tribune on October 11, 2015, under the title \"Trump's grandfather was a pimp and tax evader; his father a member of the KKK\". It opened:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThis article chronicles the life of Frederick Trump, who immigrated to the United States from Germany at age 16:\n\nTrump's grandfather was born in Germany, to parents who were employed by a vineyard. He moved to New York City in 1885 where he became a barber. After six years of this, Frederick Trump moved across the United States to Seattle, Washington, where he owned and operated what he referred to as a \"decadent restaurant\" that was actually called \"Poodle Dog\" in Seattle's red light district. Interestingly, the name and concept that had already been established in San Francisco. (He named his restaurant after a dog but would later make money selling horse meat) Around this time Frederick Trump became a US citizen.\n\nThe AHTribune.com story draws directly from Blair's book for details about the restaurant and hotel Trump co-owned in Canada during the Yukon gold rush:\n\nBut Blair rejected the \"pimp\" label for Trump in an interview with the CBC:\n\nFrederick Trump eventually made his way to New York City (after an aborted effort to resettle in Germany) with a nest egg estimated at more than a half-million dollars in current dollars, Blair wrote. He died during the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918, leaving behind some real estate to be managed by his young son Fred Trump, Donald's father.\n\nThe misleading article support's its claim that Fred Trump was \"a member of the KKK\" soley with a small newspaper article published by the New York Times in June 1927, after a clash between an estimated 1,000 klansmen and police. The clipping was first reported by the news website BoingBoing.net in September 2015 in an article titled \"1927 news report: Donald Trump's dad arrested in KKK brawl with cops.\"\n\nAccording to a New York Times article published in June 1927, a man with the name and address of Donald Trump's father was arraigned after Klan members attacked cops in Queens, N.Y.\n\n\n\nIn an article subtitled \"Klan assails policeman\", Fred Trump is named among those taken in during a late May \"battle\" in which \"1,000 Klansmen and 100 policemen staged a free-for-all.\" At least two officers were hurt during the event, after which the Klan's activities were denounced by the city's Police Commissioner, Joseph A. Warren.\n\n\n\n\"The Klan not only wore gowns, but had hoods over their faces almost completely hiding their identity,\" Warren was quoted as saying in the article, which goes on to identify seven men \"arrested in the near-riot of the parade.\"\n\nThis is the New York Times article as published in the BoingBoing.net report:\n\nThe BoingBoing.net report makes it clear that the clipping is not proof Fred Trump was a KKK member:\n\nThis is not proof that Trump senior, who would later go on to become a millionaire real estate developer, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan or even in attendance at the event. Despite sharing lawyers with the other men, it's conceivable that he may have been an innocent bystander, falsely named, or otherwise the victim of mistaken identity during or following a chaotic event.", "lang": "en"}
