No, that's not true: a scam website is luring visitors by promising free products in exchange for completing surveys, but the whole thing is a scam designed to steal personal information. The setup is similar to earlier scams targeting different brands before.\n\nIt looks like this on social media:\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of scam websites that all operate in the same manner.

But no prize will show up at your door in the end.\n\n\n\nThe scammers behind the site regularily launch new sites targeting different brands and businesses but they all look similar. An earlier version we spotted was aimed at\n\nEarlier versions of the coupon scam include Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks.", "lang": "en"}
