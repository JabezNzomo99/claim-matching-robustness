The sudden and involuntary staff shortage is disrupting all normal proceedings, including consular services.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "August 24, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-2158", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-foreign-affairs-us-embassy-visa-suspention/28695215.html", "vclaim": "After the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Russia over its meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, President Vladimir Putin announced retaliatory steps, including an order that the U.S. reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia from 1,210 to 455 -- a cut of 755 people, or around 60 percent of its diplomatic staff -- by September 1.\n\nOn August 21, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, citing the \"Russian government-imposed cap\" on its staff levels, announced it would temporarily stop issuing all non-immigrant visas from Russia until September 1.\n\nIt also said that starting on September 1, nonimmigrant visa interviews would be conducted only at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and no longer at the U.S. consulates in three other Russian cities.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denounced the U.S. decision on visas, calling it \u201cone more attempt to draw disfavor from Russian citizens toward the actions of Russian authorities.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused the visa offices of the U.S. diplomatic mission in Russia of \u201cinadequate efficiency\u201d and repeated Lavrov\u2019s allegation.\n\n\u201cThe goal is obvious \u2212 to try to provoke the discontent of Russian citizens with the difficulties purportedly caused by the staff reduction of US diplomatic and consular missions,\u201d the ministry stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying: \u201cLinking the reduction in the number of [U.S. diplomatic] staff with the processing of [U.S.] visas does not stand up to scrutiny, since no one expelled the Americans, no one dictated or specified who to send home and who to leave. Accordingly, if Washington decides to reduce the number of people engaged in visa matters, it will be Washington\u2019s decision -- sovereign, deliberate and by no means forced.\"\n\nAsked for reaction to the comments by Zakharova and other Russian Foreign Ministry officials, a U.S. State Department official told the Voice of America: \u201cWe are forced to reduce consular services by Russia\u2019s requirement that we reduce the size of our mission.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Steven Pifer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told Polygraph.info: \u201cIt is ludicrous for the Russian Foreign Ministry to suggest that this scale of personnel reduction would not affect consular operations.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. State Department official said: \u201cIt should be obvious that when a host country imposes a cap on the number of mission personnel and demands we cut our mission by, as President Putin announced, 755 positions, there will inevitably be a reduction in the services we can provide.\u201d\n\nAfter September 1, visa services will operate at reduced capacity \u201cfor as long as our staffing levels are reduced by the Government of Russia,\u201d the State Department official told VOA.\n\n\u201cThe embassy's leadership had to make decisions about how to apportion those reductions, given the mission's overall priorities,\u201d Pifer said.\n\nApart from embassy in Moscow, the U.S. has Consulate Generals in three other Russian cities \u2013 St. Petersburg, Vladivistok and Yekaterinburg \u2013\u2013 all providing visa services to Russian citizens as well as to the citizens of Belarus, a country with which the U.S. has no diplomatic relations.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, it and the three U.S. consulates are focusing on providing emergency and routine services to U.S. citizens.\n\nResidents of Belarus can no longer apply for U.S. visas in Russia. They must now apply for visas at the U.S. embassies in Poland, Kyiv, or Lithuania.", "lang": "en"}
