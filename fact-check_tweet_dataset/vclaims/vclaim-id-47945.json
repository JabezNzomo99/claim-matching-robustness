Viral video shows buildings and bridges collapsing, rivers overflowing dangerously, panicked people running helter-skelter and others trying to pull the injured out of the rubbles.\n\nThe claim along with the video says that Mexico has been hit by an earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this to be a misleading post. This earthquake video in Mexico is two years old.\n\nMany Facebook users have posted the same video claiming that it is a recent earthquake in Mexico.\n\nWith the help of keyword search, we found that a devastating earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale had hit Mexico on September 7, 2017, which killed at least 61 people and left several hundreds injured.\n\nLeading international media such as CNN had covered this calamity. During that time, Mexico was hit by two major earthquakes within two weeks.\n\nWe found a portion of the same video in a BBC news clip uploaded on September 20, 2017.\n\nMexico, however, was hit by a minor earthquake measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale on October 13, 2019. But there is no media report of a strong earthquake of 8.1 magnitude in recent times.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the video in the viral post in two years old, and hence, the post is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
