It is not found in any of his written works.\n\nThe internet is replete with claims that Nostradamus has predicted various significant world events that occurred after his death in 1566. This particular post credits him with foretelling the outbreak of the new coronavirus that has sickened hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.\n\n\u201cThere will be a twin year (2020) from which will arise a queen (Corona) who will come from the east (China) and who will spread a plague (virus) in the darkness of night on a country with 7 hills (Italy) and will transform the Twilight of men into dust (death), to destroy and ruin the world,\u201d reads the alleged prophecy Nostradamus made in 1551. \u201cIt will be the end of the world economy as you know it.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that Nostradamus ever actually wrote this prophecy. It does not appear in his 1555 book \u201cLes Proph\u00e9ties\u201d or any of his other collected works. An internet search failed to return any results prior to 2020, indicating that the quote is likely a modern creation.\n\nAs the post alludes to, the coronavirus outbreak originated in China and has since spread to countries around the world, including Italy, which has become one of the hardest hit nations, per World Health Organization data. The global economy has also taken a massive hit amid countries urging people not to gather in public spaces and instituting shutdowns, among other measures, to help curb the pandemic\u2019s spread.\n\nNostradamus fans have previously credited the 16th-century astrologer with predicting the Great Fire of London in 1666 and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in his 1555 book of prophecies.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
