Scott Fitzgerald while he was quarantining in the south of France as a result of the 1918 influenza pandemic. The letter began as follows:\n\nThis Side of Paradise: A Letter from F. Scott Fitzgerald, Quarantined in the South of France Dearest Rosemary,\n\n It was a limpid dreary day, hung as in a basket from a single dull star. I thank you for your letter. Outside, I perceive what may be a collection of fallen leaves tussling against a trash can.\n\nOne post about the letter, apparently assuming it was real, said:\n\nBut the letter in question was not written by Fitzgerald. It was published on the humor website McSweeney\u2019s on March 13, 2020, and written as a parody by Nick Farriella, who tweeted about how his post had been \u201cturned into fake news.\u201d The text didn\u2019t even mention the year it was written, nor the nature of the \u201cvirus.\u201d But the letter does bring up other notable figures like Zelda Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway:\n\nAt this time, it seems very poignant to avoid all public spaces. Even the bars, as I told Hemingway, but to that he punched me in the stomach, to which I asked if he had washed his hands. He hadn\u2019t. He is much the denier, that one. Why, he considers the virus to be just influenza. I\u2019m curious of his sources. \u2026 Zelda and I have stocked up on red wine, whiskey, rum, vermouth, absinthe, white wine, sherry, gin, and lord, if we need it, brandy. Please pray for us.\n\nThe McSweeney\u2019s post now clearly states the following at the top of the piece:\n\nThe 1918 influenza, also known as the \u201cSpanish flu,\u201d spread worldwide from 1918 to 1919 and is considered the most severe pandemic in recent history. According to a previous Snopes fact check, many cities in the U.S. closed schools, businesses, and other public spaces, and old newspaper clippings urged social distancing. These actions were largely successful in slowing the spread of the disease.", "lang": "en"}
