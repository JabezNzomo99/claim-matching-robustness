The video had been in circulation even before the commencement of the 2020 WAEC exams.\n\nThe lore about students having qualms with their invigilators during exams is not a new spectacle. However, a recent tweet by a user showed something quite unusual from the norm.\n\nThe user: @neeratou tweeted a video of two individuals engaged in serious physical fight with onlookers cheering them. The user claimed that the fight was between an invigilator and a student during the ongoing West African Examinations Council\u2019s exams, hashtagging #schoolreopening.\n\nShared on the 24th of August 2020, the video attracted over 25,000 views, 209 comments, 798 retweets, with over 1,600 likes. It was also featured on this site where it attracted 126 likes.\n\nThe name of the school or the people involved were not mentioned anywhere, as the video continues to garner even more public attention.\n\nWith the Nigerian educational structure already facing tough times amidst the pandemic, such videos merely exacerbate an already challenging situation in the educational system.\n\nAn analysis of the video on InVid traced it to this Facebook page, where it was first shared 10 weeks ago, two months before the commencement of the West Africa Examinations Council (WAEC) exams which kicked off on August 17, 2020.\n\nThe Facebook page which first shared the video described itself as a \u2018satirical sports page\u2019 containing multiple satirical videos.\n\nYet, contrary to the claimant, the principal source of the video did not attribute it to a student and invigilator fighting but rather as a mere satire designed to trigger laughter for its viewers.\n\nTo press further, we contacted the West African Examination Council via an email and placed several telephone calls through regarding the matter, but as at press time, no responses have been received.\n\nWhilst the report on lifestyle.ng shares the same narrative with the claim, it alluded to Ghana as the venue of the event, contrary to the reference of Nigeria in the claimant\u2019s version. The date also varies starkly. Lifestyle.ng published the content on August 20th 4 days before the claimant\u2019s tweet was even made. This clear mismatch indicates that the claim lacks an iota of truth.\n\nThe claim about a fight between a student and an invigilator during the West African Examination Council\u2019s examinations is False. The video has been in existence before the claim was made.", "lang": "en"}
