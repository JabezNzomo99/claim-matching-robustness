Manson and four of his followers were brought to trial in June, 1970, found guilty of the murders, and sentenced to die. Their sentences were later commuted to life in prison when the death penalty was abolished in 1972. Reinstatement of the death penalty in 1977 did not affect the revised sentences as them (or any of the other inmates whose death sentences had been commuted to life during the \u201cno death penalty\u201d phase) to the original penalty was deemed \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d\n\nOn 4 June 2014, the Empire News web site published an article positing that Manson was soon going to be released from prison due to overcrowding:\n\nOne of the most famous killers in the American prison system will be walking free.
