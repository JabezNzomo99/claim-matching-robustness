We already are an EU state, in the sense that we are a state that\u2019s a member of the EU. It\u2019s unclear exactly what the post here means, but previous posts about the Lisbon Treaty have suggested the UK would become one part of a larger federal nation. There are currently no developed plans for this to happen.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, becoming part of an EU state isn\u2019t mentioned in the Lisbon Treaty, or any other EU agreements.\n\nThe treaty also doesn\u2019t mention the year 2022.\n\nDespite several MPs claiming this, the EU isn\u2019t forcing all countries without the euro to adopt it by a certain date.\n\nThe UK (and Denmark) have an opt-out, meaning they don\u2019t have to join the euro area. The Lisbon Treaty does mention the ultimate goal of the \u201ceuro becoming the currency of all Member States\u201d but that doesn\u2019t override the UK\u2019s opt out, and it does not set a time limit on that goal.\n\nThere are also seven other EU states (without opt-outs) that don\u2019t have the euro either. They are expected to join when they meet certain criteria of economic stability and again there is no time limit on this.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the post means by sovereignty\n\nThe post claims the UK would lose its sovereignty, i.e. the power to govern itself.\n\nFor all EU members, EU law takes \u201csupremacy\u201d over domestic law. This isn\u2019t to do with the Lisbon Treaty (parliament accepted EU law\u2019s supremacy in 1972).\n\nThe UK does have power to veto some EU laws and has opted out of several EU policies, like the Schengen agreement.\n\nEU law also doesn\u2019t cover all aspects of UK law. In areas where no EU law is applicable, the UK parliament and courts are the supreme bodies for making and judging law.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if this is a literal claim, but no country loses its nationality, or right to be an individual nation because of the Lisbon Treaty or any other EU law.\n\nSome European politicians have spoken about their desire for a \u2018United States of Europe\u2019, but as we\u2019ve said before there are currently no developed plans for this to happen.\n\nThe treaty doesn\u2019t mention any change in policy about monarchs or other heads of state.\n\nThe UK is part of the EU\u2019s Common Fisheries Policy which originated back in the 1970s. This limits the number or tonnage of each fish species that can be caught by each country in a year.\n\nAt the moment EU member states are allowed to place limits on who can fish in their territorial waters, and up to 100 nautical miles from coasts, fishing is restricted to those who traditionally fished there, but the legislation covering this expires in 2022. Whether it will be replaced is a matter for the politicians to determine.\n\nThe Lisbon Treaty sets out that the EU has powers over \u201cthe conservation of marine biological resources\u201d as part of the CFP and shares power with member countries over the rest of fisheries policy.\n\nThe UK\u2019s minerals would not become \u201cEU property\u201d\n\nNational governments of countries in the EU have control over where companies can search for oil and gas, and grant licenses to those who want to produce it within their borders. We\u2019ve discussed this before.\n\nThe EU does have rules on how this licensing works. The UK government has said these rules will still apply even if there\u2019s a no deal Brexit.\n\nPermission to mine gold and silver is granted by the Crown Estate, while some other minerals are privately owned, and permission to mine those must be sought from the local mineral planning authority.\n\nThere is no mention in the Lisbon Treaty of moving any financial centres to Strasbourg. Strasbourg, in France, is the European Parliament\u2019s official base, where plenary sessions (full meetings of all the MEPs) happen.\n\nConfusion may come from the fact that the London Stock Exchange and its German equivalent had plans to merge a few years ago, but the merger was blocked by the European Commission, which said it risked creating a monopoly. This had nothing to do with the Lisbon Treaty.", "lang": "en"}
