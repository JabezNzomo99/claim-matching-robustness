And he was clear that they\u2019d managed this feat not with the financial backing of corporations, but with a grassroots network and a slew of small-money contributions.\n\n\"I'm proud that you helped me refuse corporate PAC money,\" he said to applause.\n\nLamb ran to fill Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th congressional district seat, which was vacated by former U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, a Republican, late last year. The New York Times and Democrats have called the race for Lamb, though absentee and provisional ballots were still being counted as of Friday, with Lamb leading his Republican opponent, state Rep. Rick Saccone, by hundreds of votes.\n\nThe darkhorse Democratic candidate raised millions in mostly small, online donations during the campaign \u2014 up to 62 percent of them from not just outside of the 18th district, but from outside of the state.\n\nBut is it true that corporate PAC money played no role in his campaign?\n\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, Lamb received 99 \"discrete PAC contributions\" from a total of 81 different PACs. Some of those PACs contributed multiple times. No corporate PAC contributions were reported by his campaign committee, per the FEC.\n\nInstead, many of these PACs belong to unions; veterans groups; advocacy groups, such as the JStreet PAC, a self-described \"political home for pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans\"; and a host of Democratic leadership groups.\n\n\"He mainly received money from labor PACs and Democratic leadership PACs,\" said Andrew Mayersohn, a committees researcher with the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\"Labor PACs, obviously, don\u2019t receive money from corporate PACs. Leadership PACs do (usually) take corporate PAC contributions, but I doubt that Lamb will feel indebted to Comcast just because Comcast's PAC gave to [U.S. Rep] Mike Doyle\u2019s leadership PAC last year, and Doyle gave to Lamb\u2019s campaign this year. More likely, he\u2019ll feel indebted to Mike Doyle,\" Mayersohn said.\n\nAdam Bonin, a Philadelphia lawyer specializing in political law compliance and advocacy, said the difference between accepting money from a corporate PAC and a PAC that has received corporate funds \u2014 or funds from corporate executives and employees \u2014 is significant.\n\n\"When people refer to corporate PACs, what they mean are PACs established by corporations and funded by their employees with officers and directors who decide where the funds are directed,\" Bonin said.\n\nIn Lamb\u2019s case, donations of $200 or less accounted for half of the money \u2014 millions of dollars in total \u2014 raised by his campaign, according to Anne Feldman, press secretary for End Citizens United, a prominent backer of his campaign.\n\nBut there were also donations from PACs reliant on support from executives and employees \u2014 and their relatives \u2014 at some of America\u2019s largest companies and conglomerates.\n\nThis includes Massachusetts Sen. Joe Kennedy III\u2019s 4MA leadership PAC, which counts individuals with ties to Goldman Sachs, Ford Motor Company, Home Depot and a slew of pharmaceutical companies among its Top 20 contributors, per OpenSecrets.org and the Center for Responsive Politics, the group behind the site.\n\nThe Keystone Fund PAC, U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle\u2019s political action committee, also donated to Lamb and has top donors with connections to T-Mobile, Comcast, Exelon and Google. Sen. Bob Casey\u2019s Keystone America PAC, another Lamb contributor, has Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna, Johnson & Johnson and Ernst & Young in its Top 20.\n\nThere\u2019s also AmeriPAC: The Fund for a Greater America, a Lamb donor with contributors tied to Coca-Cola and Boeing, OpenSecrets.org reports. Each of these PACs donated the maximum of $5,000 to Lamb\u2019s campaign.\n\n\"We group those [individual] contributions with corporate PACs when we talk about industry giving. For example, PNC Bank's PAC and PNC executives are ultimately part of the financial industry's political influence,\" Mayersohn said of OpenSecret.org\u2019s lists of top PAC donors.\n\n\"Since most people work for a corporation of some kind, it's pretty hard for a campaign to avoid taking contributions from \u2018corporate employees or owners.\u2019 Lamb received some contributions from PNC employees, but would not have accepted money from their PAC (if asked).\"\n\nFeldman added: \"When you're accepting money from a non-corporate PAC, it comes from hundreds, often thousands, of people who are concerned about issues that affect their day-to-day lives. This is very different from accepting money from corporate PACs which have a singular agenda, the corporation\u2019s bottom line.\" (Of course there is the potential for overlap between corporate interests and the interests of non-corporate PACs.)\n\nCorporate executives and employees are also capable of donating \u2014 with legal limits \u2014 to Lamb directly, which some certainly did. Bruce Ledewitz, a constitutional law professor at Duquesne University, said this is neither unusual nor improper.\n\n\"The question is if a rich person gives money to Donald Trump knowing Trump favors lower taxes, is that undue influence? And I say no, it is not,\" Ledewitz explained. \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s the slightest indication that campaign contributions have any influence at all. Lobbying has influence.\"\n\nMayersohn said there were also no corporate PAC expenditures on mailers or ads in support of Lamb\u2019s candidacy. \"Corporate PACs almost never make independent expenditures,\" he said. \"Sometimes trade association or industry PACs (like the American Chemistry Council or the National Association of Realtors) make independent expenditures, but not in this race.\"\n\nWhile some argue that the shunning of corporate PACs by political candidates is largely an empty gesture, groups like End Citizens United tout the Lamb campaign\u2019s lack of corporate PAC donors as a breath of fresh air.\n\nLamb campaign manager Abby Murphy also said Lamb will again refuse corporate PAC money when he runs in November, this time in the what would be the new 17th Congressional District under a statewide redistricting plan.\n\nU.S. Congressional candidate Conor Lamb said, \"I'm proud that you helped me refuse corporate PAC money.\"\n\nFEC records do not list corporate PACs as having donated to his campaign or having directly spent money in support of his candidacy. While it\u2019s possible corporate PAC money donated to other PACs reached him indirectly, experts say that\u2019s not the same thing.\n\nLamb\u2019s claim is literally accurate, but campaign finances are complicated and voters need additional information.", "lang": "en"}
