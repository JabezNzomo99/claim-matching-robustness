It is being claimed that the people in the picture are killed by the Indian Army and it exemplifies torture on Muslims in Kashmir.\n\nThe caption of the picture reads: \u2018How the Indian Army is killing our Muslims. Our Muslim brothers and sisters are being tortured in Kashmir.\ud83d\ude25\n\n Pray for our Muslim ummah\u2019.\n\nClick here for the archived post.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found that the claim attached to it is fake.\n\nWhen we put the picture through Reverse Image Search, we found a report by a Venezuela news website Mundo Oriental, dated May 2, 2020, featuring the same picture. The title of the report read, \u2018The dead in the Portuguese prison massacre amount to 46- Photos\u2019. (Translated from Spanish) According to the report, 46 prisoners were killed and more than 70 injured in a violent incident inside the Los Llanos Penitentiary Centre (CEPELLA) in Guanare, Portuguesa state, Venezuela. The authorities have attempted to justify the use of violence against the prisoners, saying that they had attempted to escape the facility. The incident was also covered by Amnesty International on May 2, 2020. The incident has been covered by various other news organisations including Reuters and BBC. Read the reports here and here. Further, we could not find any reliable source over unrest or mass shooting in Jammu and Kashmir. Hence, the above information proves that the claim is fake.
