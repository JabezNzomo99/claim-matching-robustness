Mike Pence is still claiming that the number of people living in poverty has gone up by 7 million under President Obama, nearly a week after the news came out that 3.5 million escaped poverty last year alone.\n\nAt a campaign event in Dubuque, Iowa, on Sept. 19, the GOP vice presidential nominee said:\n\nPence has been using that 7 million figure for some time. He sent it out via Twitter on Sept. 8, getting his words a bit garbled.\n\nTechnically, Pence\u2019s claim wasn\u2019t true even then. He was referring to the poverty level in 2014, not \u201ctoday.\u201d There\u2019s a big difference. We won\u2019t know what the 2016 figure is until it\u2019s released in September 2017.\n\nBut there\u2019s no excuse for continuing to use his outdated talking point nearly a week after the Sept. 13 release of new poverty figures covering 2015, showing the largest one-year drop in the official poverty rate in 16 years.\n\nAs shown in the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s historical tables, the number living in poverty last year was 43,123,000, or 13.5 percent of the entire U.S. population. Compared with the number in poverty in 2008, the difference is 3,294,000 \u2014 less than half the 7 million figure Pence incorrectly claims. And the poverty rate plunged 1.2 percentage points from 2014 to 2015, the biggest drop since 1999.\n\nAlso worth noting is that the U.S. population grew by more than 17 million between 2008 and last year. As of last year, the poverty rate was a mere 0.3 percentage points higher than it was in 2008.\n\nAs for the labor force participation rate \u2014 the percentage of the population age 16 and older that is working or looking for work \u2014 Pence was correct to say that it recently has been at the lowest levels since the 1970s, when large numbers of women were flooding into the workforce.\n\nWhat Pence failed to acknowledge was that the rate peaked in 2000, and has gone down mostly because of predictable demographic factors, including the postwar baby-boom generation reaching retirement age.\n\nPence also failed to mention that lately the labor force participation rate has been going up, not down. In August the rate was 62.8 percent of the population age 16 and older, up from 62.4 percent 11 months earlier. But why spoil a dramatic-sounding talking point by getting into the facts?", "lang": "en"}
