A boisterous crowd flanking them on both sides can be seen heckling them by hooting and pulling their party caps and flag.\n\nA caption with the viral video reads, \"If you don't vote for the Bharatiya Janta Party in the 2019 election, this incident will be replicated all over India. When the BJP workers were crossing a ghetto of Rohingyas and Bangladeshi refugees in West Bengal, they were jostled in this way.\"\n\nThe viral post can be seen here and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe video has been revived and shared by numerous pages on Facebook.\n\nAn immediate giveaway that the video is not from Bengal are the voices heard in the background. They are distinctly non-Bengali.\n\nBOOM then ran a reverse image search on the video and found that the same clip was tweeted by Dalit leader Jignesh Mewani on December 8, 2017.\n\nThe Dalit leader, in his tweet, stated that the video was from Gujarat.\n\nBOOM then searched with the keywords 'BJP Gujarat rally'. As we filtered the time settings to 2017, we found the same video published by ABP Asmita on December 7, 2017.\n\nThe video was earlier debunked by Alt News.", "lang": "en"}
