The claim is false; the black and white animal in the images is actually a Malayan tapir, an endangered species native to Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Facebook posts, for example this July 24, 2019 one which has been shared more than 2,500 times, contain a photo of a black and white animal that they claim is a panda.\n\nThe Malaysian-language caption translates as: \u201cHow badly our forests have been flattened, after a tiger and a bear, this time it\u2019s a panda found wandering among the residential area.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe photo was posted here, here and here, with a similar claim.\n\nThe animal in all of the pictures is actually a Malayan tapir -- a four-legged mammal with a trunk-like nose and distinctive white and black colouring.\n\nShown below is a comparison of the animal from the misleading Facebook post (L) and the Malayan tapir shown on the website of the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List (R).\n\nAccording to the IUCN, the Malayan tapir is an endangered species native to Indonesia (Sumatera), Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand.\n\nLocal media Utusan Online reported on the incident here on July 23, 2019, using the same photo as seen in the Facebook post.\n\nThe title of the article, in Malaysian language, reads: \u201cTapir lost in residential area.\u201d\n\nThe first paragraph, translated to English, reads:\n\n\u201cResidents in the residential area of Lavender Heights in Senawang, near here (Seremban) today was shocked by the presence of a tapir that is believed to have got lost from the nearby forest area.\n\n\u201cAn officer of the Regional Civil Defence (PPAD), Captain Md. Fadir Md. Nor said the incident happened at about 12.30, when the animal went into the residents\u2019 yard.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Utusan Online report:\n\nPandas are native to China and are not found in the wild in Malaysia.", "lang": "en"}
