These events never, ever happened and the people said them meekly, fully understand. You take a look at these people, you study these people, and you\u2019ll understand also. The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic. We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time very soon. \u2026 Last night we hear that after 12 years \u2014 this took place 12 years ago, this story \u2014 a new claim that I made inappropriate advances during the interview to this writer [Natasha Stoynoff, reporting for People magazine] and I asked a very simple question: Why wasn\u2019t it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? \u2026 These people are horrible people. They\u2019re horrible, horrible liars. And interestingly, it happens to appear 26 days before our very important election. Isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d\n\n \u2014 Trump, campaign rally in West Palm Beach, Fla., Oct. 13, 2016 Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me!\n\nQ: \u201cIs Roy Moore, a child molester, better than a Democrat? He\u2019s an accused \u2013\u201c Trump: \u201cWell, he denies it. Look, he denies it. I mean, if you look at what is really going on, and you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And, you know, you have to listen to him also. You\u2019re talking about, he said 40 years ago this did not happen. So, you know \u2013\u201d Q \u201cDo you believe Roy Moore\u2019s denials? Do you believe him?\u201d Trump: \u201cWell, he denies. I mean, Roy Moore denies it. And, by the way, he gives a total denial. And I do have to say, 40 years is a long time. He\u2019s run eight races, and this has never comes up. So 40 years is a long time. The women are Trump voters; most of them are Trump voters. All you can do is, you have to do what you have to do. He totally denies it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
