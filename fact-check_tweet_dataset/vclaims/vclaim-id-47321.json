By the following day, social media users were circulating a purported reproduction of one \u201cword salad\u201d question-and-answer exchange from that event:\n\nWhen Hannity, one of the most pro-Trump broadcasters in the U.S. news media, asked the president the softball question of \u201cWhat are your top priority items for a second term,\u201d Trump did not articulate a single second-term goal of his. Instead, he offered a stream-of-consciousness narrative about the importance of the word \u201cexperience,\u201d explained how he hadn\u2019t spent much time in Washington prior to becoming president, and derided John Bolton (Trump\u2019s former National Security Advisor, who had just published an embarrassing book about his experiences in the Trump administration) as an \u201cidiot\u201d:\n\n\n\n After that exchange, Hannity abandoned his efforts to get Trump to explicate his second-term goals and instead fed the president a couple of questions that allowed Trump to continue disparaging Bolton and boast about his accomplishments before taking audience questions:", "lang": "en"}
