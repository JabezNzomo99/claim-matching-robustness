(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIn fact, we debunked something similar in October. A Sept. 25 post with more than 75,000 shares claimed President Donald Trump was sending chain mail and \"asking everyone to forward\" an email about \"The TRUMP Rules: Congressional Reform Act of 2017.\"\n\nThe rules were virtually identical to those that appear in the Buffett post. For example, rule No. 1\n\nDeclared \"no tenure/no pension. A Congressman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they are out of office.\"\n\nOther versions of this post have been around since at least 2009, when Buffett was also featured. In 2011, the phony legislation was called the \"Congressional Reform Act of 2011\" and while neither Trump nor Buffett were named, FactCheck.org checked its claims.\n\nIn 2012, U.S. News and World Report ran a story called \"Warren Buffett and the mythical \u2018Congressional Reform Act.\u2019\"\n\n\"Incendiary emails like the bogus Buffett petition aren\u2019t an argument for cleaning up Congress,\" the publication said. \"They\u2019re a better argument for civics tests for voters.\"\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
