The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.\u201d As protection against infection, the CDC recommends washing hands often, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, wearing a face mask when feeling ill, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, and staying distant from other people.\n\nThe British Nutrition Foundation states here , \u201cNo food or supplement, can protect you from getting the coronavirus (COVID-19). Nevertheless, having a healthy diet is important in supporting our immune function and many nutrients influence the body\u2019s ability to fight infection.\u201d\n\nIt is true that vitamin C and zinc play vital roles in the body\u2019s immune system. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), \u201cvitamin C improves the absorption of iron from plant-based foods and helps the immune system work properly to protect the body from disease\u201d (here). The NIH also says that zinc \u201chelps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses\u201d (here).\n\nHowever, milk does not contain a significant amount of vitamin C or zinc. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) lists foods and their nutrients in a database. For non-branded whole milk, it lists 0.903 mg of zinc and 0 mg of Vitamin C per cup (here).\n\nThe National Dairy Council (NDC) confirmed to Reuters via email that \u201cCow\u2019s milk is not a good source of vitamin C or zinc based on [the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s] definition of what can be called a \u2018good\u2019 source\u201d. They listed other nutrients present in cow\u2019s milk \u2013 including Vitamin A, D and protein \u2013 that can help maintain healthy immune function.\n\nA report by The Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy listing the health benefits of dairy products (by nutrients they contain qualifying as \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d) makes no mention of Vitamin C and lists zinc as a nutrient found in yoghurt, but not cow\u2019s milk (here ). The NDC confirmed yoghurt is a good source of zinc, but that cow\u2019s milk isn\u2019t.\n\nThe effects of lactoferrin, defined here as \u201ca protein found in cow milk and human milk\u201d, on the immune system are not widely known. The NDC confirmed to Reuters that tests with lactoferrin have been limited and with mixed results.\n\nDr. Mark Pochapin (here), a gastroenterologist at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center, said he did not think there was \u201creally any significant health benefit to lactoferrin.\u201d Like the CDC and the WHO, Dr. Pochapin advised that people \u201cjust be meticulous\u201d about washing their hands, avoid touching their face, and keep social distancing.\n\nPartly false: No food or drink can prevent catching the coronavirus, although milk can form part of a healthy diet that will support immune function. Milk is not a good source of vitamin C or zinc, and the effects of lactoferrin on the immune system are not fully known.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
