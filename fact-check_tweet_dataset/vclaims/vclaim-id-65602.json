Mike Sington, the person who sent the tweet making the claim, confirmed that it was meant to be satirical.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on July 23 that plans to hold some Republican National Convention activities in Jacksonville, Florida, have been canceled, according to The Associated Press. Trump had moved the rally portion of the convention from North Carolina to Florida after a dispute with North Carolina\u2019s Democratic leaders over holding a large indoor event during the coronavirus pandemic, per NPR.\n\nThe Facebook post, which features a screen grab of a tweet from Sington, claims the Trump campaign announced an \u201call star\u201d lineup of speakers set to appear via Zoom at the Republican National Convention.

Had the campaign announced this group of speakers, media outlets would have reported it, yet none have. A Trump campaign spokesperson confirmed to the Daily Caller in an email that the screen grabbed tweet is incorrect.\n\nA closer inspection of Sington\u2019s Twitter profile reveals he often posts satirical content about political issues. Sington confirmed to the Caller in a Twitter direct message that he intended the tweet announcing speakers to be satirical.\n\nA small group of delegates will meet for a few hours to formally renominate Trump in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Aug. 24, per the Associated Press.", "lang": "en"}
