Chuck Schumer say \u201cit\u2019s racist to only allow citizens to vote\u201d?\n\n\n\nA: No. A Facebook meme and viral stories continue to incorrectly quote the Senate Democratic leader.\n\n\n\nIn an August 2017 column on the website Medium, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer railed against what he called an \u201cassault\u201d on voting rights.\n\nSchumer \u2014 writing in the aftermath of the deadly Charlottesville, Virginia, protests \u2014 condemned President Donald Trump\u2019s then-fledgling Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.\n\nThe Senate minority leader argued that the commission, which was created to examine \u201cfraudulent voting\u201d and other issues, was part of an \u201ceffort to intimidate voters\u201d \u2014 namely minorities \u2014 \u201cand purge them from the rolls through a national voter database of personal information.\u201d\n\nIn the year since that post was published, online headlines have continued to take liberty in interpreting Schumer\u2019s opinion piece, saying that the senator was making the case that non-citizens should be able to vote \u2014 including by using a direct, incorrect quote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s racist to only allow citizens to vote,\u201d reads the supposed quote attributed to Schumer, repeated on a meme posted on Facebook this week.\n\nBut Schumer never said that, in his Medium piece or elsewhere.\n\nThe spread of the fictional quote has seemed to surpass the distribution of the Medium column. For example, the Sept. 29 Facebook post of the meme alone was shared nearly 10,000 times. The Medium post, by contrast, has been shared on the platform less than 300 times, according to CrowdTangle data.\n\nThe erroneous quote even made its way into a July letter to the editor of a local newspaper in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n\nThe federal election integrity commission was eventually disbanded, as Schumer had hoped. Facing resistance from states in gathering data, Trump dissolved the panel in January 2018.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cExecutive Order on the Termination of Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.\u201d WhiteHouse.gov. 3 Jan 2018.\n\n\u201cResponses to the \u2018Voter Fraud\u2019 Commission\u2019s Voter File Data Request.\u201d Brennan Center for Justice. 5 Oct 2017.\n\nSchumer, Chuck. \u201cAfter Charlottesville, It\u2019s Time to End the Assault on Voting Rights.\u201d Medium.com. 24 Aug 2017.", "lang": "en"}
