He was actually calling for Democrats to show unity and stop attacking each other on the campaign trail.\n\nBiden made a campaign stop in Kansas City, Missouri, on March 7, after which his presidential campaign posted a video of the full speech on his verified YouTube channel.\n\nMultiple Facebook users shared a short clip from Biden\u2019s speech, with the headlines and captions suggesting that he endorsed Trump for president. Dan Scavino, the White House director of social media, and Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA founder, also shared versions of the clip on Twitter, where Trump retweeted them.\n\n\u201cTurn this primary from a campaign that\u2019s about negative attacks into one about what we\u2019re for, because we cannot get reelect \u2013 we cannot win this reelection,\u201d Biden says in the clip. \u201cExcuse me, we can only reelect Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller reviewed the entirety of Biden\u2019s speech and found that the viral clip has been deceptively edited to make it appear like the former vice president is endorsing his political rival. Biden did stumble over his words as he spoke, but the clip leaves out the important context that Biden was actually calling for Democrats to show unity and stop attacking each other.\n\n\u201cIf you want a nominee who will bring this party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign and turn this primary from a campaign that\u2019s about negative attacks into one about what we are for, because we cannot get reelect \u2013 we cannot win this reelection,\u201d Biden said. \u201cExcuse me, we can only reelect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It\u2019s got to be a positive campaign, so join us.\u201d\n\nBiden made the same point while speaking earlier in the day as well.

It marked the first time that Twitter had used the label since implementing the policy on March 5, according to USA Today.", "lang": "en"}
