The posts have been shared thousands of times.\n\nThe posts say: \u201cWe knock on the door and place parcel/items down on the door step and take a step away, when the person comes to the door we tell them the parcel is on the step then ask the name, then we sign it as C V 19, there is to be no personal contact whatsoever.\u201d\n\nWe contacted Royal Mail, who confirmed that this is true, although \u201cC V 19\u201d is not the code that its staff will be using.\n\n\u201cRoyal Mail continues to deliver a full service across all parts of the UK,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIn order to protect both our people and customers, we are temporarily not handing over our hand-held devices to customers to capture signatures. Postmen and postwomen will instead log the name of the person accepting the item, and can sign on their behalf.\u201d\n\nThis statement is repeated on the Royal Mail website, which adds that there is now a similar procedure for items that will not fit through the letterbox. \u201cWe will place your item at your door,\u201d it says. \u201cHaving knocked on your door, we will then step aside to a safe distance while you retrieve your item. This will ensure your item is delivered securely rather than being left outside.\u201d\n\nRoyal Mail also says that it has been advised by Public Health England that \u201cpeople receiving parcels are not at risk of contracting the coronavirus\u201d. We\u2019ve written more on this subject here.", "lang": "en"}
