A vaccine against the flu did not exist at the time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), having \u201cno vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections that can be associated with influenza infections\u201d meant that \u201ccontrol efforts worldwide were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings, which were applied unevenly.\u201d ( here )\n\nAccording to the CDC report \u201cAchievements in Public Health, 1900-1999,\u201d prior to 1900, the vaccines for smallpox, rabies, typhoid, cholera and plague had been developed in the U.S. (see Table 1 here ). The report states that \u201calthough the first vaccine against smallpox was developed in 1796, greater than 100 years later its use had not been widespread enough to fully control the disease\u2026 Four other vaccines -- against rabies, typhoid, cholera, and plague -- had been developed late in the 19th century but were not used widely by 1900.\u201d\n\nIt is true that U.S. soldiers during World War I were subject to immunization requirements. However, it is not true, as the post claims, that this was the first major conflict in which this happened. Published by the National Institute of Health (NIH)\u2019s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in 2018, a paper ( here ) called \u201cThe US Military Commitment to Vaccine Development: A Century of Successes and Challenges,\u201d says that \u201cthe first large-scale smallpox infection prevention campaign was conducted in 1777 by the Continental Army.\u201d\n\nIn addition, a 2006 paper called \u201cImmunization to Protect the US Armed Forces: Heritage, Current Practice, and Prospects,\u201d published here by the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, says that American servicemen underwent some version of smallpox immunization in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the Civil War (1861-1865), and the Spanish-American War (1898). (See Table 2: \u201cImmunizations used widely during major conflicts\u201d) During World War I, soldiers were given live smallpox and whole cell typhoid inoculations, as well as therapeutic tetanus and diphtheria antitoxins. \u201cWith a vaccine to shield troops from typhoid bacteria during the unsanitary conditions of World War I,\u201d the paper says, \u201ca mere approximately 2,000 cases of typhoid fever, with 227 deaths, were reported among 4.1 million Americans in uniform.\n\nKilling an estimated 675,000 Americans ( virus.stanford.edu/uda/ ), the 1918 H1N1 flu pandemic (also referred to as the \u201cSpanish Influenza\u201d or \u201cSpanish flu\u201d) was indeed the deadliest flu pandemic in modern history ( here ).\n\nThe outbreak of the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d was recorded in Spain in May 1918, several months before the November 11, 1918 armistice ending WWI. In the U.S., \u201cit was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918\u201d and that \u201ccrowded conditions and the movement of troops during World War I likely contributed to the spread of the 1918 virus around the world,\u201d according to the CDC ( here , here ).\n\nThe specific origins of the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d outbreak are unknown, but it is known to have been an H1N1 Influenza \u201cwith genes of avian origins\u201d ( here ). In terms of geography, \u201cFrance, China and Britain have all been suggested as the potential birthplace of the virus, as has the United States\u201d according to the history channel ( here ).\n\nFinally, the claim that \u201cmore of our men were being killed by medical shots than by enemy shots from guns\u201d is unsubstantiated. There is no evidence to show any vaccine killed more men than \u201cenemy shots from guns\u201d. According to a paper called \u201cThe U.S. Military and the Influenza Pandemic of 1918\u20131919,\u201d by the NCBI in 2010, it was \u201cinfluenza and pneumonia [that] killed more American soldiers and sailors during the war than did enemy weapons.\u201d ( here ) The U.S. did not develop the first influenza vaccine until the 1940s ( here ) and the first pneumonia vaccine until 1977 ( here ).\n\nFalse: the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic was not caused by vaccines, WWI was not the first time that immunization was required for U.S. soldiers, more U.S. soldiers were killed by influenza and pneumonia, not \u201cmedical shots,\u201d than by enemy fire during WWI.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
