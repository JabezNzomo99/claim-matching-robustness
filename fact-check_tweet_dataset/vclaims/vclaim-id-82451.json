The claim appears to originate from a satirical Facebook post.\n\nHawaiian Gov. David Ige signed the Our Care, Our Choice Act into law in 2018, joining Colorado, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia in offering the option of medically assisted suicide to individuals through law, per CNN. The Hawaiian law went into effect in January 2019, according to The Associated Press.\n\nA viral Facebook post alleges the Hawaiian government purchased 30 \u201cpassing assistance pods\u201d to help aid medically assisted suicides. It purportedly describes the procedure of using the pods and includes an image of the machines the state allegedly purchased.\n\n\u201cTo start the procedure, the client must hold their hand down on a button for 30 seconds; this confirms to the system that they are ready to go,\u201d reads the post. \u201cAt this point, the pod door locks and a mixture of gases are dispensed into the pod. These gases cause the person\u2019s brain to slowly shut down over a period of around 15 minutes. The combination of gases is tasteless and odorless and causes the patient to fall into an endless sleep.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any credible media reporting about Hawaii buying the pods described in the post. There also does not appear to be any record of the state purchasing them on Hawaii\u2019s State Procurement Office website.

The machine is intended to produce a rapid decrease in oxygen level until the user dies but, according to the product\u2019s website, it is \u201cnot and will not at this point be for sale.\u201d\n\nThe claim seems to stem from a post shared on the Facebook page The State of Hawaii, a self-described \u201centertainment website\u201d that is not affiliated with the state\u2019s government. The State of Hawaii Facebook page makes it clear that the post is satirical in the comments, though some social media users lifted the image and text, portraying it as real.\n\nThe Hawaiian law for medically assisted suicide requires two health care providers to confirm an adult patient\u2019s diagnosis of a terminal illness, prognosis of less than six months to live and that the request is voluntary, according to The Associated Press. The patient, who must undergo a mental health evaluation, must also make two oral requests for the medication at least 20 days apart and one written request signed by two witnesses, per the Hawaiian Department of Health website.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
