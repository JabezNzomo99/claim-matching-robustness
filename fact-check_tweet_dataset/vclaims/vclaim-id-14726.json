The post claims that the letter was written by Congress leader MB Patil to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi in July 2017.\n\nAmong others, a Facebook page by the name BJYM Chandigarh has posted the letter with the caption saying: \"The letter written to Sonia Gandhi by Congress leader MB Patil exposes shocking details of how Sonia Gandhi wanted to divide Hindu communities.\"\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the letter to be a fake. The organisations named in the letter do not even exist.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe alleged letter, written on the letterhead of Bijapur Lingayat District Educational Association (BLDE Association) of which Patil is the president, is also shared by Facebook users Chowkidar Hitesh Tiwary and Narsimh Prasad.\n\nThe official Twitter handle of BJP Karnataka uploaded the letter on Tuesday (April 16) morning to which Karnataka Congress quickly responded through a short video dismissing its authenticity.\n\nIn the video, MB Patil, incumbent Home Minister of Karnataka, said the letter is a fake and legal action will be taken against those who produced and published it.\n\nAFWA's investigation did not find any trace of the organisations 'Global Christian Council (GCC)' and 'World Islamic Organisation (WIO)' on the internet. These organisations were named in the letter, with whose help the Congress had allegedly schemed to execute the plan of dividing Lingayats in the state.\n\nThis is not the first time this letter has stirred controversy. Earlier, during Karnataka Assembly elections in May 2018, the same letter went viral. At that time, Boomlive had debunked the claim.", "lang": "en"}
