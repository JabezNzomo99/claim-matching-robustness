Shortly thereafter, a social media post started to circulate that claimed the investigation was over because NASCAR discovered Wallace had actually mistook a serpentine belt for a noose. This is not a genuine news story \u2014 Wallace did not mistake a serpentine belt for a noose, and the included statement in this post from NASCAR is completely fabricated. This statement does not appear on NASCAR\u2019s website nor any of its social media profiles. In a June 21 statement, NASCAR said that it was \u201coutraged\u201d by the incident and that whoever was found responsible would be expelled from the sport: Wallace also released a statement: This incident occurred a few weeks after NASCAR announced that it was banning the display of the Confederate flag at all of its official events. In the wake of this decision, we\u2019ve seen several junk news stories and hoaxes about NASCAR. For instance, the sport is not banning the national anthem, prayer, military flyovers, or MAGA apparel.\n\nUpdate 6/23/20 3:34 p.m. PT: After this story was published a joint statement from federal authorities announced that their investigation found the noose had been hanging in the Talladega Superspeedway garage since as early as October 2019 (long before it was assigned to Wallace) and no federal charges would be pursued.", "lang": "en"}
