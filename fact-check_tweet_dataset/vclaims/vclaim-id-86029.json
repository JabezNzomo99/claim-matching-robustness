About 2.5 million jobs have been created since Trump took the oath of office.\n\u2022 None He once again cited the unemployment rate \u2014 especially for African Americans \u2014 even though he repeatedly said during his campaign that the unemployment rate was phony and could not be trusted.\n\u2022 None He claimed he had attracted 32,000 people at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on the eve of the election when the venue held only 4,200 and local media estimated that perhaps that many were waiting outside, for a total of 8,000.\n\u2022 None He claimed he had \u201cessentially\u201d gotten rid of Obamacare, when he has not. He also falsely suggested he only failed to pass repeal legislation because of one vote, ignoring the fact that none of the substantive replacement bills got nearly enough votes. Sen. John McCain\u2019s vote was against a \u201cskinny\u201d repeal that was only to lead to talks with the House on a common position, with no guarantee of an agreement that would pass both Houses.\n\u2022 None He falsely claimed that Democrats colluded with the Russians, and the whole probe started with \u201ca document that was paid for by the DNC [Democratic National Committee] and Hillary Clinton.\u201d But the DNC was a victim of Russian activities, as its emails were hacked and then released via WikiLeaks. The House Intelligence Committee has confirmed that the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence probe began with a tip from the Australian government, which notified U.S. authorities about a drunken conversation between a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, and an Australian diplomat in May. Papadopoulos claimed the Russians had \u201cpolitical dirt\u201d on Clinton. The information in the dossier funded by Democrats came to the attention of the FBI later.\n\u2022 None He got simple facts wrong, such as claiming that Henry Ford invented the assembly line (it was Ransom Eli Olds) and that Franklin D. Roosevelt served 16 years (it was 12). He also said the European Union was created \u201cto take advantage of the United States\u201d even though it was created after World War II with the aim of ending bloody conflicts on the continent \u2014 and with the active support of the United States.\n\u2022 None He once again claimed that under the Iran nuclear agreement, the United States gave the country $150 billion. But this was always Iran\u2019s money. Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe because of international sanctions over its nuclear program. The Treasury Department estimated that once Iran fulfilled other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. The Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion.\n\u2022 None He once again claimed that President Xi Jinping of China instantly agreed to a request from Trump to allow the sale of U.S. beef after years of blocking it. But China had already agreed to such sales under a deal brokered by the Obama administration.\n\u2022 None He said \u2014 for the 29th time \u2014 that the U.S. trade deficit with China is $500 billion. But it\u2019s really about $300 billion. He also said \u201cwe lose about $500 billion\u201d through the trade deficit even though countries do not \u201close\u201d money on trade deficits.\n\u2022 None He claimed \u201cwe have done more than anybody in a year\u201d and \u201cI accomplished more than I promised.\u201d In reality, at the end of his first year, Trump had signed fewer bills than any president since Dwight D. Eisenhower (though he has since caught up and passed Obama and is tied with George W. Bush). As for promises, our Trump Promise Tracker shows Trump has only kept 23 percent of 60 key promises and broken 27 percent.", "lang": "en"}
