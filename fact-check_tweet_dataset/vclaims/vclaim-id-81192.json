The article spoke about Khan\u2019s reaction to Jamshed\u2019s death in a plane crash in December of that year. The article also said that Khan had met Jamshed when he went for Hajj with his mother, but did not mention the year.\n\nThe viral claims on social media clearly got Jamshed\u2019s name wrong, instead identifying him as Junaid Samshed, as well as misidentifying him as a terrorist. Jamshed was actually a well-known Pakistani figure, a singer and fashion designer-turned-Islamic preacher who began his music career in 1983 and is famous for music albums such as \u2018Us Rah Par\u2019. However, he later left his music career behind and started focussing on religious activities.\n\nWe also found a video where Jamshed is speaking of his meeting with Aamir Khan at Hajj.", "lang": "en"}
