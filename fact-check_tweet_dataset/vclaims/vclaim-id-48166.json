A spokesperson for McDonald\u2019s confirmed that the coupon is \u201cnot a legitimate offer.\u201d\n\nThe post, which features an image of the supposed coupon, redirects social media users to a website that bears the McDonald\u2019s logo and asks users to select their favorite \u201ccombo meal\u201d from four options. It requires users to answer the question and share the link to claim the one-time coupon that\u2019s allegedly valid from March 29 to April 30.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s is helping out!\u201d reads text on the website. \u201cJust tell us what is Yor (sic) favorite meal and get 2 FREE big Mac Meals for a Month!\u201d (RELATED: Can Inhaling Hot Air From A Sauna Or Hair Dryer Kill Coronavirus?)\n\nThe link and its coupon offer are a scam, however. The website\u2019s URL doesn\u2019t match that of the official McDonald\u2019s website, and it does not at any point provide access to a valid coupon or voucher. A spokesperson for McDonald\u2019s confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the link is \u201cnot a legitimate offer.\u201d\n\nSome McDonald\u2019s franchisees have provided free meals to health care workers amid the coronavirus pandemic. Costa Enterprises, which owns 24 McDonald\u2019s restaurants in northwest Florida, said in a Facebook post that it served more than 9,000 free meals to local hospital employees between March 18 and March 31.\n\nIn-person dining at corporate-owned McDonald\u2019s locations in the U.S. has been closed since March 16, according to a press release.", "lang": "en"}
