Vora claims to have worked with the Gujarat Samachar, a leading Gujarati daily. The message spews venom on the late editor and chairman of Gujarat Samachar Shantilal Shah and his son Shreyans Shah, who is the current editor and publisher. It alleges that the owners of the newspaper are close to the Gandhi family and are staunchly anti-Modi and anti-BJP/RSS. The text of the \u2018letter\u2019 is as follows.\n\nTranslation: Sudhir Vora, formerly a journalist at Gujarat Samachar exposes Shantilal Shah and his son Shreyans Shah to be staunch Congress supporters. A few years ago when Shreyans was about to enter Rajya Sabha on a Congress ticket, Modi had stopped him. Do you know this Shah family has close relations with the Gandhi family. In every foreign property, Gandhi family plays a role. From the beginning, Shreyans has been an opponent of the RSS and BJP. Through his Gujarat Samachar, He has constantly been trying to remove the BJP government and Narendra Modi. Now when I am retiring, I want to apologize to the public because I did let go any chance to tarnish the image of Modi Saheb. I am sorry for misleading the public through the medium of social media. I cannot say this on TV and Newspaper because every news channel and newspaper are interlinked with each other and as I know they won\u2019t show you all the facts. In newspapers, you will see news of corrupt politicians, police and government officials on a regular basis but have you ever seen, the newspapers disclosing corruption, black money or illegal assets of journalists or editors? The fact is that most of the corruption is done only by media. Friends Narendra Modi is the most active and honest leader of Gujarat and India. Presently, he is incomparable. From the time, when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, we have tried very hard to defame Modi but his popularity hasn\u2019t declined. Many false allegations have been published in the article. Indirectly, the people did not do so through the writings of Gujarat Samachar but they weren\u2019t successful. In 15 years, we have never praised the good works of the Modi government and only tried to spread poison among the people, which is still being carried out. But now I \u2018m not involved. I\u2019 m retired now. In short, Shreyas Shantilal Shah will never write good words for Modiji till the Congress government doesn\u2019t come to power. Just make sure my apology letter reaches to the people so that my burden will be lessened.)\n\nThe content of the \u2018letter\u2019 is replete with remorse; the journalist laments the \u2018poison\u2019 that has been spread against BJP and Narendra Modi by the newspaper through numerous negative and malicious reports over the years, and goes on to praise the latter as the \u2018most active and honest leader of Gujarat and India\u2019. The message has also been shared by many Facebook users, touted as an actual account of a senior journalist.\n\nAlt News did a google a search with keywords \u201c\u0ab8\u0ac1\u0aa7\u0ac0\u0ab0 \u0ab5\u0acb\u0ab0\u0abe\u201d (Sudhir Vora) using a site syntax (gujaratsamachar.com), in which no result related to this appeared. It may however be noted that the website doesn\u2019t have a long history compared to the years of existence of the print edition of the newspaper. Gujarat Samachar was first published in 1932.\n\nAlt News contacted the Gujarat Samachar office to find out the truth. In a conversation with Alt News, Bhaven Kachi, a renowned columnist with Gujarat Samachar confirmed that there was no such employee in their records. He said, \u201cI haven\u2019t come across anybody named Sudhir Vora in my association with Gujarat Samachar from last 26 years.\u201d.\n\nSince this is a WhatsApp message which masquerades as the personal account of a senior journalist associated with a popular daily publication, it comes across as believable. It is thus not surprising that it has been shared widely on multiple social media platforms.", "lang": "en"}
