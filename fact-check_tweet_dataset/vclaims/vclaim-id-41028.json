More than 96% of the network\u2019s thousands of thrift stores have closed to comply with local and state government guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus, Goodwill spokeswoman Lauren Lawson-Zilai told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email statement.\n\nOne viral Facebook post alleges that Goodwill fired \u2014 rather than laid off or furloughed \u2014 all of its employees. Getting fired for cause can jeopardize a worker\u2019s ability to collect benefits, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\n\u201cI just want to share what Goodwill Industries just did to all their employees,\u201d reads the post. \u201cThey use this pandemic to fire all their employees instead of laying them off. They did say they would hire them all back as a brand new employee with no built up benefits or vacation time.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s claim is inaccurate, however. While local Goodwill organizations across the country have laid off or furloughed employees, some operations have not shuttered.

Some employees, like those in human resources, finance and operations and store management, will keep their jobs, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our Goodwills have transitioned their mission delivery online,\u201d Lawson-Zilai told the DCNF in an email. \u201cMany Goodwills are providing job preparation skills, job search techniques, job leads and placements, and job readiness skills, including resume writing, interview skills building, dressing techniques and more online to their community members.\u201d\n\nLawson-Zilai also said many Goodwills have pivoted their focuses to community partnerships. For instance, one Goodwill has partnered with a local dry cleaner to clean donated clothes that health workers can use as smocks.

Those employees were laid off \u2014 not fired \u2014 and will receive a \u201cseverance package, which includes two-weeks\u2019 pay, to help these team members in their transition to new employment,\u201d according to the statement.\n\n\u201cWe truly hope when this situation passes, we will be able to rehire the majority of these employees,\u201d concludes the statement from the Goodwill of Central and Northern Arizona.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
