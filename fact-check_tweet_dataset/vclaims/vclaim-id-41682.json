No, that's not true: a scam website is luring visitors by promising free merchandise in exchange for completing surveys, but the whole thing is a scam designed to steal personal information. The setup is similar to earlier scams targeting different brands.\n\nThe scam appeared as a post (archived here) on Facebook on April 28, 2020, under the title \"Sam's Club has announced that everyone who shares this link will receive $250 coupon! TODAY ONLY.\" It opened:\n\nTo help our loyal Customers, We are giving away $250 coupon to all Please answer the questions below first: Question 1: What would you like to take?\n\nThis is what the post looked like at the time of this writing:\n\nThis is what the survey looks like when you click on the post:\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of scam websites that all operate in the same manner. First, three questions are asked -- typically asking if you are satisified with some brand, if you have used their product or if you would recommend it to others. Three possible answers are offered each time \"Yes,\" \"No\" or \"Don't remember.\"\n\nNo matter what answers are given, visitors are redirected to a screen that looks like this, inviting them to share and like the page on Facebook to claim the prize:\n\nThe comment form at the bottom is also fake: comments are automatically appearing, but they do not come from real people. The whole thing is scripted: if the page is reloaded, the same comments start appearing again. Clicking the share button does bring up a real share popup from Facebook, but it does not share the exact URL of the page: it varies the random-looking string of letters and numbers at the end, so that to Facebook, it will look like a new and different article is being shared. This makes it harder to detect and do something about it, because each link needs to be individually reported and taken down.\n\nClicking the like button takes people through a series of redirects via various pages, probably depending on which ads or scams the people behind the site need to promote at the time. But no prize will show up at your door in the end.\n\nThe scammers behind the site regularily launch new sites targeting different brands and businesses, but they all look similar. Earlier versions we spotted were aimed at Dunkin' Donuts, JetBlue, Starbucks, Costco, Little Caesars, Alaska Airlines and Delta Airlines.", "lang": "en"}
