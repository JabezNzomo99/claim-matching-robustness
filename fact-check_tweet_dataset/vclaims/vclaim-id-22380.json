No, that's not true: a \"fauxtire\" website just copied an earlier hoax from a different website (which had stolen it from yet another site) and upped the number from 200 to 250 (and the older, original story spoke of over 3000).\n\nThe latest version appeared in an article published by Huzlers on August 23, 2018 titled \"Police Discover Over 250 Penises During Raid At Funeral Employees Home\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nPolice made an astonishing discovery this morning while executing a search warrant at the residence of a Bloomington mortician: 250 embalmed human penises.\n\nAuthorites suspected 54-year old Paul Houston, an employee of the McLean County Coroner's Office, of being implicated in an organ trafficking network. Investigating several reports of missing organs and body parts, dozens of police raided his residence this Monday morning, hoping to find evidence of his involvement in the crimes.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and might have thought it was an original story:\n\nWe debunked the earlier \"200\" version of the hoax here:\n\nFake News: Bloomington Police Did NOT Discover Over 200 Penises During Raid At Funeral Employee's Home | Lead Stories Did the cops find over 200 penises during a raid at the home of 54-year-old Paul Houston, an employee of the McLean County Coroner's Office? No, that's not true: the story was made up by a fake news website imitating the look and feel of Fox News by using their logo and a similar domain name.\n\nAnd the \"3000\" version here:\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Kodak Black NOT Arrested Again Just 1 Day After Being Released From Jail On Marijuana and Illegal Firearm Charges\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Hanging On Traffic Light And Sh*tting On Cars Passing Underneath\n\u2022 Fake News: Drug Dealer Did NOT Call Cops On Demi Lovato After She Ran Off Without Paying For Heroin\n\u2022 Fake News: Suspect NOT Caught For The Robbing And Kidnapping Of Tekashi69 After Trying To Pawn Jewelry", "lang": "en"}
