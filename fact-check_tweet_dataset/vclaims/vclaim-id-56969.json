In one picture, the same woman can be seen interacting with Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi, while in the other, she is sitting in a car.\n\nThe picture is being circulated with a claim that Congress brought in people to act as migrants for Rahul Gandhi\u2019s interaction and then they were taken back in cars, after it got media coverage.\n\nYou can see more posts here, here and here.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the viral post and found the claim to be false.\n\nWe individually checked both the pictures in circulation.\n\nWe found the first picture in a tweet by newswire ANI, dated May 16, 2020. \u201dDelhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today interacted with migrant labourers who were walking on Sukhdev Vihar flyover to return to their home states, \u201d the tweet read.\n\nWe found another tweet by ANI, stating that Congress volunteers also arranged vehicles to take them to their homes. This tweet also featured the same lady in the car, but the picture was taken from a different angle. ANI also quoted a labourer saying, \u201cComing from Haryana, have to go to Jhansi.\u201d\n\nMoreover, we also found a report by ABP news, that was uploaded on their Facebook Page on May 16.\n\nIn the video at 1:29 min, the reporter asks a migrant worker that was he already informed that Rahul Gandhi will be coming or was is impromptu. To this, the migrant worker replied, \u201d It was very sudden. We were walking home when some people said that Rahul ji will be coming. So, we waited for a while to talk to him.\u201d\n\nIn the video report, at 2:31 minutes, the same lady can be seen climbing in the vehicle, while a party worker can be heard saying that the vehicle has been arranged by congress volunteers to get the migrant workers home.\n\nThe above information proves that the picture is being circulated with a false narrative.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
