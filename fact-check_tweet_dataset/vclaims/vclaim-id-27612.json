(Pakistan Doctors, Nepal Doctors, and Indian Doctors)\n\nIn the post, the health warning is authenticated by the name \u2018Dr.Anjali Mathur\u2019 (Chairman & CMO \u2013 Indo American Hospital, South Dakota, US). But, when looked for the \u2018Indo American Hospital\u2019 in South Dakota, it was found that there is no hospital with that name. So, a fake doctor profile was created to authenticate the claims in the post. Let\u2019s try to check some of the claims in the post.\n\nWhen searched for information on Kurkure containing plastic, it was found that the FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) have tweeted regarding this issue. In the tweet, the FSSAI has said that the rumour on plastic Kurkure is a hoax. In a news article on its website, it was also found that the FSSAI has \u201cclarified that the presence of a compound called acrylamide causes the food item to burn when lit with a match stick and it does not contain any plastic material.\u201d\n\nIn an article published by the \u2018Deccan Chronicle\u2019 in 2014, a video can be found in which a person eats Mentos and drinks Diet Coke. But, it can be seen that the person is fine even after consuming that combination. The article, also, contains the reason for the blow out of Coke from the bottle when Mentos is dropped into Coke. The explanation reads, \u201cthe numerous small pores on the candy\u2019s surface catalyze the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas from the soda, resulting in the rapid expulsion of copious quantities of foam\u201d. So, Cyanide is not formed when Mentos and Pepsi are combined.\n\nThis rumour is in circulation from many years and was debunked earlier too. In a fact-check article published by Hoax or Fact in 2012, it can be found that none of the ingredients of Appy Fizz is carcinogenic. Also, neither FSSAI nor any research studies reported on Appy Fizz containing carcinogenic ingredients.\n\nTo sum it up, the \u2018HIGH ALERT\u2019 message from Dr. Anjali Mathur is a hoax. Also, most of the claims in the message are false.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
