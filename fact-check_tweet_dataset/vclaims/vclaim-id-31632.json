And I didn\u2019t need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people.\u201d He then claimed, without evidence, that these artists would come in and perform a couple of songs at Clinton events because she was unable to get a crowd. \u201cWhat happens is they leave and everyone leaves with them, and she\u2019s still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd. Craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, Occupy Democrats posted a meme that quoted Springsteen as saying \u201cWe\u2019re living in a frightening time. The stewardship of the nation has been thrown away to somebody who doesn\u2019t have a clue as to what that means. Trump doesn\u2019t have a grasp of what it means to be an American\u201d:\n\nThat statement was correctly attributed to Springsteen and was taken from a two-part October 2019 interview the musician sat for with \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d to promote his concert film \u201cWestern Stars\u201d:\n\nBruce Springsteen laughed off Donald Trump\u2019s recent comments about him during a campaign rally, with the singer adding that the president \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a grasp\u201d on what it means to be an American. When CBS This Morning\u2018s Gayle King asked Springsteen if he was \u201csurprised\u201d that Trump was still \u201ctrash-talking\u201d him, Springsteen just laughed and replied, \u201cAnything\u2019s possible.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re living in a frightening time,\u201d Springsteen added. \u201cThe stewardship of the nation has been thrown away to somebody who doesn\u2019t have a clue what that means. Unfortunately, we have somebody who doesn\u2019t have a grasp of the deep meaning of what it means to be an American.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a video excerpt of Springsteen\u2019s remarks from that \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d appearance:", "lang": "en"}
