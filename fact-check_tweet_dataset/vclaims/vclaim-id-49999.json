Health experts in Florida and Texas have not reported emergency rooms visits for fungal lung infections caused by masks.\n\nAs more states have moved to require the wearing of face coverings in public spaces, social media has become replete with misinformation about them. This particular post claims people have been seeking treatment for fungal lung infections caused by masks in emergency rooms around the country.\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to enter ER\u2019s with fungal lung infections from wearing masks!!\u201d reads the image\u2019s text. \u201cTake breaks from your masks!!\u201d (RELATED: Did Florida\u2019s Surgeon General Recommend People Stop Wearing Face Masks?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence such a thing is happening. Had wearing face coverings been causing emergency room visits for fungal lung infections, it likely would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also not issued a warning about them causing such infections.\n\nThe Daily Caller reached out to hospital and medical associations in Texas and Florida, as well as the Texas Department of State Health Services, and none of them reported a trend in emergency room visits for fungal lung infections caused by face coverings. Texas, which recently instituted a statewide mask mandate, and Florida have both seen a rise in coronavirus cases in recent weeks.\n\nCarrie Williams, vice president of communications for the Texas Hospital Association (THA), told the Caller that she had not heard of hospitalizations from wearing masks from THA\u2019s experts.
