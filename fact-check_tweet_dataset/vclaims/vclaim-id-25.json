PepsiCo the parent company that produces Mtn Dew products released this yesterday\u201d.\n\nIt then quotes Niwrad Eiknarf, CPO of PepsiCo as saying: \u201cDue to the increased evidence that drinking our line of Mtn Dew products has been shown to adversely affect health over long periods of use, we have decided to discontinue production of these products. Production will cease as of June 31, 2020 and availability will be limited to stock on hand until it is deplenished. We are sorry for this inconvience (sic) and hope that you will try one of our other great products.\u201d\n\nThe word \"inconvenience\" is spelled wrong in this alleged statement. June only has 30 days, June 31, as claimed, does not exist. PepsiCo does not list a Niwrad Eiknarf or any CPO on its leadership page on its website here). A wider search shows no results for anybody named \u201cNiwrad Eiknarf\u201d, at PepsiCo or elsewhere. This person appears to be fabricated.\n\nThere are no press releases by PepsiCo that mention anything about their Mountain Dew product being discontinued. They released a zero-sugar version of Mountain Dew in January 2020 (here)\u200b\n\nPepsiCo confirmed with Reuters that this claim is false.\n\nFalse: PepsiCo did not announce that Mountain Dew is being discontinued", "lang": "en"}
