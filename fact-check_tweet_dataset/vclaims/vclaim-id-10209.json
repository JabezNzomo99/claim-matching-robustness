At around the two-minute mark, employees respond to his request to salvage some of the food by stating that it is \u201call bad,\u201d presumably indicating that they believe it is unsafe to eat.\n\nWalmart\u2019s Facebook response team issued a series of replies to agitated commenters, attributing the circumstances to the aftermath of a power loss in the area of the store on 5 November 2017:\n\nLimaohio.com also reported widespread power outages following the storm:\n\nWith areas of the city still without power [a day later], damage assessment was ongoing after the EF2 tornado whipped through Celina. A second tornado, also an EF2, was confirmed in the vicinity of St. Anthony in western Mercer County. According to Midwest Electric, the storm caused just more than 1,000 of its customers to lose power, with almost all restored by midnight.\n\nA state of emergency was declared in an area affecting Celina, Ohio, and local news outlets listed Walmart among businesses heavily affected by power loss and storm damage.\n\nWalmart also sent us a statement that read as follows:\n\nThe video shows that Walmart did, indeed, throw away piles of food \u2014 but what it left out was that the store was responsibly disposing of spoiled or spoiling food after an hours-long power outage following an uncommonly destructive tornado. The circumstances under which the food came to be discarded were documented extensively in local news, and Walmart\u2019s response was well supported by coverage of the early November 2017 weather event in Celina, Ohio.", "lang": "en"}
