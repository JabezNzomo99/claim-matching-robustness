Beto O\u2019Rourke made a series of disparaging comments about the elderly and veterans, despite what a popular meme claims.\n\nA meme circulating on Facebook claims that Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former Democratic congressman from Texas, said: \u201cIF I COULD THROW TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE GARBAGE IT WOULD BE THE ELDERLY AND WOUNDED VETERANS. WHEN A TOOL BREAKS YOU DONT FIX IT, YOU THROW IT IN THE DAMN TRASH.\u201d\n\nWe searched the internet, the Congressional Record and the Nexis news database, and found no evidence that he uttered those words or expressed any such sentiments.\n\nO\u2019Rourke gained national attention during his unsuccessful 2018 campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. He is now considering whether to run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nContrary to the statements attributed to him in the meme, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s old Senate campaign site, which includes his positions on seniors and veterans, promises support for those groups.\n\nWith regard to seniors, it says: \u201cTexas seniors have built the families, communities, and businesses we now enjoy. We owe it to them to honor and protect the commitment we made to care for them through Social Security and Medicare.\u201d\n\nOn veterans, it says: \u201cOur veterans should receive the care and dignity they have earned. That begins with ensuring that every veteran can receive access to quality healthcare, timely resolutions to their disability claims and appeals, and sustainable housing.\u201d\n\nHe also recorded a video in which he says, for those reasons, he asked for a seat on the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, and cosponsored bipartisan legislation to \u201copen up mental health care access\u201d in an effort to \u201cimprove quality of life for those veterans and in many cases, literally, save their lives.\u201d\n\nOne such bill, the Honor Our Commitment Act of 2017, which O\u2019Rourke introduced in the House and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy introduced in the Senate, was later included in an omnibus appropriations bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in March 2018. It called for the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide mental and behavioral health care services to veterans who received \u201cother-than-honorable\u201d discharges.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nBeto for Senate. \u201cVeterans.\u201d Website accessed via the Internet Archive. 14 Feb 2019.\n\nBeto for Senate. \u201cSeniors.\u201d Website accessed via the Internet Archive. 14 Feb 2019.\n\nU.S. House. \u201cH.R. 1685, Honor Our Commitment Act of 2017.\u201d (as introduced 22 Mar 2017.)\n\nOffice of Sen.
