The gap is seven years for women. Other studies looking specifically at the impact of deprivation on life expectancy have found similar figures.\n\nLife expectancy does vary across the UK\n\nLife expectancy for newborn boys in England and Wales was highest in Kensington and Chelsea, at around 83 years. It was lowest in Blackpool at almost 75 years.\n\nThat\u2019s a difference of almost nine years, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics covering 2012 to 2014.\n\nFor girls born during the same time, life expectancy is highest in Chiltern in Buckinghamshire, at around 87 years and lowest in Middlesbrough, at just under 80 years. The difference in life expectancies here is almost seven years.\n\nIn 2014 Kensington and Chelsea, and Buckinghamshire were among the ten areas in the UK with most disposable household income per head. Blackpool is among the twenty areas of the UK with least disposable income, and the South Teesside area containing Middlesbrough is one of the 40 areas with least disposable income.\n\nAverage life expectancy at birth across England and Wales over this period was 79 for men and 83 for women.\n\nLife expectancy is lowest in the North and highest in the South\n\nThe majority of the top 50 local areas in England and Wales which had the lowest life expectancy for both girls and boys were found in the North East and North West of England and in Wales.\n\nThe top 50 local areas with the highest life expectancy were almost all in the East Midlands, South East, East of England, South West or London.\n\nThe link between deprivation and life expectancy\n\nA 2015 study by the King\u2019s Fund think tank looked at life expectancy in England from 1999 to 2003 and 2006 to 2010. It found that the majority of areas with persistently low life expectancy during this time also had a high proportion of people earning low or no wages. It also found that the reverse was largely true.\n\nOther studies have found similar links. The Marmot Review commissioned by the Secretary of State for Health in 2008 said that average life expectancy was seven years lower in the poorest communities compared to the wealthiest. When this review looked at disability-free life expectancy this gap widened to 17 years.\n\nThese studies looked specifically at the link between life expectancy and income deprivation, whereas the ONS figures which looked at disposable income.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund found that a number of other factors affected life expectancy, including deprivation in old age, housing deprivation, binge drinking, fruit and vegetable consumption and gender.", "lang": "en"}
