However, France's foreign ministry rejected the claims and AFP Fact Check found no trace of such an announcement.\n\n\"BREAKING NEWS,\" reads a post in \"Africa is HOME\", a Facebook page with more than 45,000 followers. \"Emmanuel Macron, the president of France and colonial master of France Africa says: Any African country that refuses its citizens from taking the Corona virus vaccine would be banned from travelling in Europe (sic)\".\n\nThe post prompted angry responses, including comments that Europeans should \"stop coming to Africa\" and \"leave us alone\".\n\nSimilar Facebook posts have been shared in Cameroon, Morocco (in French) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (in French).\n\nScreenshot of the false claim shared on Facebook, taken on June 10, 2020\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked various false claims about vaccination in Africa since two leading French doctors sparked accusations of racism for discussing the idea of testing a COVID-19 vaccine on the continent.\n\nAlso Read: No, COVID-19 Is Not Caused By Bacteria Or Cured By Antibiotics\n\nMany of the Facebook posts, which have been circulating since June 5, feature a photo of Macron alongside a quote in French attributed to the president. \"Emmanuel Macron: Citizens of any African country not willing to use the European vaccine for COVID-19 will no longer travel to Europe,\" it reads.\n\nScreenshot of the false claim shared on Facebook, taken on June 10, 2020\n\nAFP Fact Check ran a Google reverse image search on the photo and traced it to the archives of Reuters news agency. According to Reuters' photo caption, the picture was taken at a press conference in the Polish capital Warsaw on February 3, 2020.\n\nIn the press conference (in French), Macron discussed various issues such as nuclear weapons and European defence.

Only the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, could propose such legislation.\n\nGuillaume Roty, a spokesman for the European Commission in France, dismissed the claims in an interview with French channel TV5Monde (in French).\n\n\"There's been no announcement regarding the need to be vaccinated to enter the Schengen area,\" he said, referring to the group of 26 European countries without border controls between them.\n\nIt's not the first time politicians have been targeted in the wave of misinformation and disinformation triggered by the pandemic.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked claims including a doctored news report apparently announcing that US President Donald Trump tested positive for COVID-19 and posts claiming Nigerian politician Atiku Abubakar pledged to pay citizens to stay home during lockdown.", "lang": "en"}
