Also, Maryland has only eight congressional districts, and New Jersey has only 12 districts.\n\nAnd the pictures that were published with the story are of two unrelated public officials. One picture shows the former mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey, Peter Cammarano, being taken into the FBI\u2019s Newark headquarters following a major corruption bust in 2009. The other shows the 2016 arrest of Arkansas state Rep. John Walker for allegedly obstructing governmental operations after he filmed a traffic stop by police in Little Rock. The charge was later dropped.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nLysiak, Matthew and Lisberg, Adam. \u201cShocking bribe probe hauls in dozens in New Jersey.\u201d New York Daily News. 23 Jul 2009.\n\nBrantley, Max. \u201cPolice release Walker arrest video; shows cops accusing him of being \u2018race baiter.\u2019\u201d Arkansas Times. 28 Sep 2016.", "lang": "en"}
