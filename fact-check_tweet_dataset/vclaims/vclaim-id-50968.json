How about a false story disguised as a fact-check?\n\nA viral satirical story circulating on Facebook heralds a false headline that says a \"fact check\" proves House Speaker Nancy Pelosi diverted billions from Social Security to pay for impeachment costs.\n\nThe article\u2019s headline, which is the only part of the story that users can see when it is shared on Facebook, reads: \"FACT CHECK: Yes, Nancy Pelosi Moved Billions from SSI to Cover Impeachment Costs.\" It got over 46,000 views in its first 24 hours.\n\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Another satirical article that made a similar claim received our Pants on Fire rating when a screenshot of the headline went viral without any accompanying explanation to signal that it was intended to be satire. That one claimed Pelosi diverted $2.4 billion from Social Security to cover impeachment costs.\n\nThis latest headline comes from a story published on a site called \"Americas News Source\" that actually pokes fun at the people who believed that earlier story, as well as those who believe this one, calling people who shared the item \"\u0440\u0435\u0430-br\u0430\u0456n\u0435d trum\u0440\u0441hum\u0440\u0455 \u0441l\u0430m\u043er\u0456ng about l\u043e\u0455\u0456ng their \u0455\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0430l security.\"\n\nIt continues, saying that there is \"no way\" Pelosi would be able to \"pull off \u0455u\u0441h a r\u0456d\u0456\u0441ul\u043eu\u0455 stunt, even if \u0455h\u0435 w\u0430nt\u0435d to, \u0430nd 2.4 b\u0456ll\u0456\u043en d\u043ell\u0430r\u0455 was randomly invented t\u043e \u0455\u043eund l\u0430rg\u0435.\" It also reads: \"W\u0435 at Fr\u0435\u0435d\u043em F\u0456\u0441t\u0456\u043en\u0455 rate th\u0456\u0455 t\u0430l\u0435 tru\u0435 because we \u0430r\u0435 \u0430l\u0455\u043e \u0440\u0430rt \u043ef th\u0435 Am\u0435r\u0456\u0441\u0430\u2019\u0455 L\u0430\u0455t L\u0456n\u0435 of Defense network, and h\u043en\u0435\u0455tl\u0443, \u0456f this \u0456\u0455 \u0456n the \u0430rt\u0456\u0441l\u0435, \u0430nd \u0443\u043eu still \u0441\u0430n\u2019t t\u0435ll \u0456t\u2019\u0455 \u0455\u0430t\u0456r\u0435, \u0443\u043eu n\u0435\u0435d a kick in the balls.\"\n\nWe rate this headline Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
