Racist monuments make me sick.\u201d This claim and quote are both fabricated.\n\nExamples of such posts can be found here , here , and here .\n\nA representative for Swift confirmed by email that these claims were false.\n\nThe posts share an image, likely a photoshop made to look like a screengrab from Brazilian media outlet O Globo ( www.globo.com/ ). The inclusion of the Portuguese phrase \u201cAtualizado ha 1 hora\u201d (Updated 1 hour ago), despite the rest of the post being in English, indicates that the purported screenshot is inauthentic, combined with the fact that the story is not on O Globo\u2019s website.\n\nThe false claim may have been prompted by Swift\u2019s calls on Twitter ( here ) and Instagram ( here ) last month for the state of Tennessee to remove a monument to Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate Army general who became the first \u201cGrand Wizard\u201d of the Ku Klux Klan ( here ), and not to replace a torn-down statue of Edward Carmack, a late-19th-century newspaper editor who incited a mob against Black journalist and civil rights activist Ida B. Wells for her denunciation of lynching and other racial injustices ( here ).\n\nSwift wrote on Twitter: \u201cAs a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things. Edward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cTaking down statues isn\u2019t going to fix centuries of systemic oppression, violence and hatred that black people have had to endure but it might bring us one small step closer to making ALL Tennesseans and visitors to our state feel safe - not just the white ones. We need to retroactively change the status of people who perpetuated hideous patterns of racism from \u2018heroes\u2019 to \u2018villains.\u2019 And villains don\u2019t deserve statues.\u201d\n\nFollowing the death of George Floyd, nationwide protests against police brutality and white supremacy have included the toppling of Confederate monuments by citizens, as well as demands that local authorities remove them ( here , here ). Anti-racism protesters see the monuments as anti-Black markers of hate while others see them as public documents of history and heritage.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Statue of Liberty, contrary to what the post falsely claims Swift said, was not built by slaves, as construction did not begin until a decade after the end of the Civil War. In 1876, French craftsmen and artisans started construction of the statue in France, designed by sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi as a celebration of the centennial of the U.S. Declaration of Independence ( here ).\n\nBy 1884, the entire statue was completed and put together in Paris, while construction workers, many of whom were recent immigrants, began building the statue\u2019s pedestal on Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor ( here , here ). The workers who reassembled the statue once it arrived in New York were also largely new immigrants.\n\nLess than a mile from Ellis Island, the country\u2019s busiest immigrant processing station between the late-19th and mid-20th centuries, the Statue of Liberty \u201cgrew as an inspiration to immigrants who sailed past her on their way to America,\u201d according to the Liberty Ellis Foundation ( here ), particularly with the inscription of Emma Lazarus\u2019s poem \u201cThe New Colossus\u201d ( here ) on a plaque in the pedestal in 1903.\n\nFalse. Taylor Swift did not say that the Statue of Liberty should be taken down.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
