Pelosi met with Nadler (D-N.Y.) and several other top Democrats who are aggressively pursuing investigations against the president, according to multiple sources. Nadler and other committee leaders have been embroiled in a behind-the-scenes turf battle for weeks over ownership of the Democrats\u2019 sprawling investigation into Trump. Nadler pressed Pelosi to allow his committee to launch an impeachment inquiry against Trump \u2014 the second such request he\u2019s made in recent weeks only to be rebuffed by the California Democrat and other senior leaders. Pelosi stood firm, reiterating that she isn\u2019t open to the idea of impeaching Trump at this time. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,\u201d Pelosi said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting. Instead of impeachment, Pelosi still prefers to see Trump defeated at the ballot box and then prosecuted for his alleged crimes, according to the sources.\n\nAfterwards, a meme began on social media stating that former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, who self-identified as a \u201cliberal Democrat,\u201d had declared he was \u201cappalled at\u201d Pelosi for \u201cweaponizing the criminal justice system\u201d:\n\nDershowitz did offer the response to Pelosi\u2019s reported comment, as quoted in the meme, during an appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d The meme omitted several sentences from the middle and ending of Dershowitz\u2019s response, although without substantively changing the gist of his remarks:\n\nHowever, Dershowitz\u2019s reaction didn\u2019t seem to correspond to the context of what Pelosi had reportedly said.\n\nThe House Speaker, according to Politico, didn\u2019t assert \u2014 as Dershowitz suggested \u2014 that she wanted or expected Trump, while a sitting president, to be simply thrown in prison without his having been charged with any crime or afforded due process. As reported by Politico, Pelosi\u2019s viewpoint at the time was that she \u201cprefers to see Trump defeated at the ballot box and then prosecuted for his alleged crimes,\u201d and her remark about \u201cwant[ing] to see him in prison\u201d was not a public declaration but rather a comment she allegedly made in a private meeting with Democratic leaders that was subsequently leaked.", "lang": "en"}
