The Constitution does not say that.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry facing President Donald Trump is bound to have far-reaching political effects. But it is not the case that a potential impeachment by the House could allow Trump to seek an additional term beyond the two elected terms allowed by the Constitution.\n\nThat falsehood, which originated as a purported joke, is being spread on Facebook as if real.\n\n\u201cThese Democrats don\u2019t realize that if they impeach Trump and the Senate doesn\u2019t confirm it then it nullifies Trump\u2019s first term and he gets to run two more times,\u201d the posts read. \u201cRead the Constitution, people.\u201d\n\nThere is no part of the Constitution that says that. Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University, also confirmed as much.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the Constitution\u2019s language, structure, or history to support any such claim,\u201d Tribe told us in an email.\n\nThe posts are screenshots of an Oct. 1 tweet from a Trump-supporter named Jack Posobiec, whose previous posts have played into conspiracy theories such as the debunked \u201cpizzagate\u201d scandal.\n\nFollowing his tweet about impeachment, Posobiec referred to the claim as a joke and said \u201cwith one tweet I got the libs to not only read, but actually defend the Constitution for once!\u201d\n\nBut comments on Facebook, where thousands shared snapshots of the tweet, suggested that some didn\u2019t get Posobiec\u2019s joke.\n\n\u201cWow. Hope this is true,\u201d one man wrote. Others expressed confusion and inquired for more information about the supposed stipulation.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment dictates that presidents are permitted to hold office for two elected terms.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
