Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of helicopter showering flower petals on the walking migrant workers. Fact: The photo is an edited one. Two different photos are clubbed to show that petals are being showered on the walking migrant workers. While the helicopter photo was taken in 2018, the migrant workers walking photo was taken in March 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn observing the photo, the differences in the sky can be clearly seen. When the helicopter part was cropped and ran through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, it was found in \u2018The Seattle Times\u2019 article published in 2018. In the description, it can be read that the photo was taken during the Republic Day parade in 2018. The same photo can be also found on the \u2018AP Images\u2019 website.\n\n\n\nOn cropping the migrants part and running it through Google Reverse Image Search, the photo was found in \u2018The Statesman\u2019 article published in March 2020. In the description, it can be read that the photo was taken in Faridabad on 27 March 2020. The photo can be also found on the \u2018Getty Images\u2019 website. The armed forces showered flower petals on 03 May 2020 to salute corona warriors, the frontline health workers.\n\nTo sum it up, an edited photo is falsely shared as \u2018Helicopter showering flower petals on the walking migrant workers\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
