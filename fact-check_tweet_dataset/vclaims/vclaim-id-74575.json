Questions still surround her death, which officials called a suicide. But the video gives Americans a clearer look at the explosive start of the arrest that put her behind bars to begin with.\n\nThe director of the Texas Department of Public Safety criticized Encinia\u2019s actions, saying that the trooper violated arrest procedure. But some people are also questioning Bland\u2019s behavior, including her refusal to put out her cigarette at Encinia\u2019s request.\n\nDon Lemon led a CNN Tonight on July 21 about the ordeal with legal analyst Sunny Hostin, liberal pundit Marc Lamont Hill and retired New York Police Department detective Harry Houck.\n\nMost of the panel agreed with Hostin\u2019s advice for dealing with law enforcement: Essentially, make the encounter as short as possible by obeying orders and dealing with legal issues or mistreatment later. Lemon then asked Houck to clarify the legal rights that people actually have during a police stop \u2014 and that\u2019s where the discussion got murky.\n\nLemon asked if all the attention on this encounter and others around the country \"is giving people a false sense of rights that they have, that they really don\u2019t have?\"\n\nYes, Houck responded. \"People actually think, that I've talked to, saying that, no, if a police officer stopped me for something, I don't think he's stopping me for a right reason, but I don't have to cooperate with the officer. But that is wrong,\" he said.\n\nHouck continued: \"The law says, just like you said, Don, that when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says and then deal with it later.\"\n\nRead literally, Houck\u2019s statement seems to give law enforcement a lot of leeway during stops. Are civilians really required to obey their each and every order?\n\nBefore we dive into the legal issues underlying Bland\u2019s arrest, let\u2019s review what the shows. Encinia pulls Bland over for a failure to signal as she changed lanes. Encinia retrieves Bland\u2019s driver\u2019s license and insurance and heads back to his car. After four and a half minutes, Encinia returns to issue a ticket to Bland. At the window, he asks her if she\u2019s okay.\n\n\"I\u2019m waiting on you, this is your job,\" she says.\n\n\"You seem very irritated,\" he tells her.\n\n\"I really am,\" Bland replies, explaining why she\u2019s unhappy that she was pulled over. Encinia asks if she\u2019s done speaking, then asks her to put out her cigarette. Bland refuses, saying that she\u2019s free to smoke a cigarette in her own car.\n\nEncinia then directs her out of the car, calling it a \"lawful order.\" When she doesn\u2019t move, he opens the door and forcibly removes her, pointing a Taser in her direction and threatening to \"light her up.\"\n\nAfter Bland exits the car, Encinia issues a number of orders, including for her to put her phone down, to \"come over here,\" to \"stand right here,\" and to \"turn around.\" The confrontation becomes physical shortly afterwards, before Encinia puts Bland in the back of his squad car.\n\nThe panelists were divided on the issue of whether Bland escalated the situation by claiming rights she did not have when she refused Encinia\u2019s order to put out her cigarette. Experts we consulted said Bland had the right to act the way she did, but Encinia may have, too. Here\u2019s why.\n\nPleading the Fifth (and the Fourth)\n\nDoes the law really say you have to do whatever a police officer says during a traffic stop?\n\nLiterally, no. The Constitution affords to everyone stopped or arrested by law enforcement in the United States. The right to refuse a search of one\u2019s person, car or home is guaranteed by the , and the right to remain silent is protected by the . No matter how much information Encinia wanted to get out of Bland, she was not legally obliged to provide it.\n\n\"You definitely don\u2019t have to answer questions,\" said Robert Weisberg, a Stanford University law professor who specializes in criminal justice and procedure.\n\nSo Houck\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t hold up under constitutional scrutiny. When reached for comment, Houck said his comments were being taken too literally, adding he only meant that civilians were obligated to comply with orders \"within reason.\"\n\n\"Anybody with common sense knows what I said,\" he said.\n\nHouck told PunditFact that he had been focusing primarily on the legality of Encinia\u2019s order for Bland to exit her car, a point he brings up early on in the panel discussion but doesn\u2019t stress throughout.\n\nIn the interview, he brought up Pennsylvania vs. Mimms, a Supreme Court case from 1977 in which two implicated law enforcement officers were found not to have violated the Fourth Amendment when directing a man to exit his car upon stopping him for a traffic violation. He argued that the precedent established in Mimms applies to Bland\u2019s arrest as well.\n\nHouck does have a point that officers have a considerable amount of authority over a person during a traffic stop.\n\nIn Mimms, after directing a man out of his car, officers noticed a bulge under the man\u2019s jacket. The bulge turned out to be a loaded gun, and the man was then arrested. The court ruled that exiting one\u2019s car for the duration of a stop did not violate a person's Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nSo Encinia, using Mimms as jurisprudence, had the right to direct Bland out of her car, even if he had no reason to suspect that she was armed or dangerous.\n\nSome have argued, however, that because the \"legal stop\" was finished by the time Encinia directed Bland out the car, he did not have the right to continue the interaction.\n\nBut the broader point that Houck misses in his explanation is that much of an officer\u2019s authority to search or use force or a person is permissible only if they have reason to suspect that the person is armed or dangerous, or has committed a crime.\n\nWhat exactly constitutes \"reasonable suspicion\" is still up for for debate. Weisberg emphasized how gray this area of law still is.\n\nA non-answer, for example, can often be interpreted by law enforcement as \"furtive behavior,\" thus authorizing many options an officer might not have otherwise had, including searching, moving, or using force on a subject, Weisberg said.\n\nMaking these judgment calls is where officers have the most leeway, said Jason Williamson, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who recently wrote a Bland-inspired article for Time entitled \"What to Do if You Get Pulled Over by a Cop.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s certainly true that cops are given discretion and the benefit of the doubt,\" Williamson said.\n\nIn order for Encinia to argue that he was suspicious of Bland, he would have to point to her refusal to put out her cigarette as an indication of violent intentions, said Jody David Armour, a University of Southern California law professor. \"That is a judgment of intent,\" he said, \"and a judgment of character.\"\n\nHouck claimed that \"the law says \u2026 that when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says\" during a stop.\n\nReasonable suspicion justifies an officer\u2019s increased authority during a stop or an arrest, though the definition of \"reasonable\" is often unclear.\n\nApplied generally, however, the claim is incorrect. Even though it might be advisable to defer to law enforcement in many cases, the Constitution protects one\u2019s right to remain silent and to not consent to a search. Without suspicion that the subject is armed or has committed a crime, an officer must respect these rights. That's what the law says.\n\nCorrection: This item was updated on July 31 to correct the sequence of events in describing Pennsylvania vs. Mimms. In that case, the Supreme Court found that the act of ordering a person out of a car for the duration of a stop, even in the absence of reasonable suspicion, is constitutional.", "lang": "en"}
