This means people who alleged minor ailments such as muscle spasms, neck pain, back pain and even menstrual cramps have qualified for government-sanctioned pot-smoking.\"\n\nPolitiFact Florida wanted to check out what conditions patients could get medical marijuana licenses for under the proposed Florida law.\n\nLet\u2019s start by taking a look at the proposed . The ballot summary reads:\n\n\"Allows the medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating diseases as determined by a licensed Florida physician. Allows caregivers to assist patients\u2019 medical use of marijuana. The Department of Health shall register and regulate centers that produce and distribute marijuana for medical purposes and shall issue identification cards to patients and caregivers. Applies only to Florida law. Does not authorize violations of federal law or any non-medical use, possession or production of marijuana.\"\n\nSo when a doctor prescribes cannabis, the Department of Health will issue the patient a license. Under Florida law, patients would not be able to grow their own plants.\n\nApproved patients could purchase marijuana from registered, state-regulated centers. The amendment says how the centers will operate with regard to registration, record-keeping and safety would be determined by the department after passage.\n\nBecause medical marijuana would be legally dispensed, the program is government approved. However, saying it\u2019s \"government-sanctioned\" isn\u2019t quite right, because government officials are not encouraging marijuana use, as the definition of the word \"sanction\" would imply.\n\nIn the amendment text itself, which goes beyond the ballot summary, we get a list of qualifying diseases:\n\nAnd here\u2019s the part that Judd referred to: \"or other conditions for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient.\"\n\nThat means it\u2019s up to doctors to determine if patients could benefit from using medical marijuana.\n\nJudd draws a comparison between what the proposed amendment in Florida would allow and what patients in other states have experienced.\n\nOut of the 20 states (plus the District of Columbia) that have legalized medical marijuana, only California and Massachusetts have requirements similar to Florida\u2019s proposal that allow for physician discretion when it comes to qualifying conditions. Most other states have a finite list of conditions, but say that the health department could add more or assign waivers. So Florida\u2019s amendment would have a more relaxed standard than most states.\n\nWhen we reached out to Judd, his spokesman told us that it\u2019s clear medical marijuana access would not be limited to what he referred to as \"debilitating\" illnesses.\n\nOther critics of medical marijuana have pointed out that any system, even in states with stricter rules, is not immune to loopholes and abuse. For example, an reported that 90 percent of cardholders in the state claimed chronic pain. However, the biggest age group claiming chronic pain was 18- to 30-year-olds, even though chronic pain is more common in older adults.\n\nSo we can understand why Judd\u2019s editorial speculates about the possibility that some healthy individuals will try to acquire licenses.\n\nSo we know Florida has a flexible definition of which conditions qualify a patient for medical marijuana, which supports Judd\u2019s point. But should the conditions he lists really be considered \"minor ailments\"?\n\nUniversity of California, San Francisco doctor Donald Abrams has studied the effects of cannabis on cancer and HIV patients . Based on his experience treating and studying chronic illnesses, he said the conditions Judd listed are often serious.\n\n\"Some of these things that your sheriff considers to be trivial require people to take opiates,\" Abrams said, adding that these medications (such as morphine) are less safe than marijuana.\n\nSeveral experts pointed out that muscle spasms are a common symptom of multiple sclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that would already be greenlighted for medical marijuana treatment if the Florida amendment passes.\n\nNeck pain, back pain and menstrual cramps are also frequently treated with prescription pain medication.\n\nToday chronic pain affects about 100 million U.S. adults, according to the .\n\nOh, and as for menstrual cramps, ladies? Abrams said opted for a little marijuana therapy to relieve her pain in the 19th century.\n\nSo yes, Judd is right that someone with one of these ailments would be eligible for a medical marijuana license at a physician\u2019s discretion. But it\u2019s a misleading generalization to describe these conditions as \"minor.\"\n\nJudd said that people with \"minor ailments\" could get access to marijuana if Florida\u2019s proposed amendment passes next year. He mentioned spasms and other chronic pain as a minor condition, when sometimes those conditions are quite serious. But compared to most other states, Florida\u2019s ballot language is flexible because it allows for physicians to determine whether a patient\u2019s condition qualifies for a license.
