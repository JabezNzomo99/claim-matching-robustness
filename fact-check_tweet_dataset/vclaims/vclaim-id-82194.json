Frequently in speeches, interviews and even his Reddit Ask Me Anything Q&A, he touts that for a 10-year period after he became mayor, the city achieved the \u201cbiggest reduction\u201d in crimes (which he sometimes specifies as Part 1 crimes) in any major city in America.\n\nAs O\u2019Malley weighs a 2016 presidential run, his critics are raising questions about his record on policing strategies. This is a timely topic, as Baltimore residents take to the streets to protest the police-custody death of Freddie Gray. Gray, 25, died on April, 19, 2015, a week after was arrested. Police say he suffered injuries to his spine. His death has become the latest symbol in the ongoing national debate over policing strategies.\n\nThe Fact Checker obviously takes no position on O\u2019Malley\u2019s policing tactics. But it is worth exploring his statement about his record. Are his figures accurate? What is the context of those figures, especially in comparison to rates in other jurisdictions?\n\nFBI data confirm his calculation. The overall crime rate (the number of crimes per 100,000 people) fell by 48 percent during that decade, more than any other large police agency in the country. Specifically for violent crimes, the Baltimore City Police Department saw the third highest drop (behind Los Angeles and New York City) during the period.\n\nSome criminologists measure the number of homicides to measure crime levels. In 2009, Baltimore saw the lowest homicide rates since O\u2019Malley took office. (Prior to his tenure, however, there was a high homicide rate following the crack cocaine epidemic.) But the city\u2019s homicide rate was still ranked second highest out of cities with more than 500,000 residents.\n\nOne of O\u2019Malley\u2019s strategies, which he refers to in the Iowa speech, was the measuring of input and output. Baltimore began using CompStat, which started in New York City in 1994 and closely tracked arrest data and practices. This strategy is linked to the \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy that some large police departments adopted at the time.\n\nSuch approach to policing led to increased arrests. By 2005, well into O\u2019Malley\u2019s tenure as mayor, Baltimore police arrested so many people that judges had to free arrestees because they could not get court hearings within 24 hours, as required, according to the Baltimore Sun. That year, there were 108,447 people arrested in a city of roughly 600,000 residents. According to a June 2010 report by the Justice Policy Institute, about two-thirds of the people in jail were there for non-violent offenses.\n\nThe FBI cautions against making comparisons with its data, in a warning published annually with its crime statistics. The agency cautions the media, tourism agencies and others in the public from using reported crime figures to compile rankings of cities and counties. These rankings \u201clead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions,\u201d as there are many variables that factor into the unique geographic and demographic situation in a city or state.\n\nSteven Kearney, a former O\u2019Malley adviser, said the \u201cambitious\u201d policing, guided by CompStat and similar principles of measuring arrests, was just one of O\u2019Malley\u2019s approach to driving down crime rates. He also created policies and to hold police officers accountable, increase the availability of drug treatment and provide more opportunities for children and students in schools, Kearney said.\n\nKearney acknowledged that many factors contribute to lowered crime rates during any government official\u2019s tenure, but there is only so much government can control: \u201cIt\u2019s government\u2019s responsibility to make a difference where it can. Baltimore\u2019s policing strategy evolved over time and as violent crime was reduced, arrests also declined \u2014 a trend that has continued in the years since. Baltimore has made a lot of progress reducing crime, but the work certainly continues.\u201d\n\nAt The Fact Checker, we often are critical of politicians bragging about successes during their term \u2014 such as job gains and drops in crime \u2014 that can result from numerous factors out of their control. Such claims usually result in Two Pinocchios. But O\u2019Malley uses a specific measurement of FBI data, and his claim about Part 1 crime rates from 1999-2009 check out. It is to his credit that he references this wonky measurement most of the time in his statements, when most politicians would be tempted to drop that caveat.\n\nBut we also take the FBI\u2019s warnings against comparing raw crime rates seriously. O\u2019Malley\u2019s policies as mayor may have contributed to the decline in crime rates, but there are many variables at play. As evidence of that, Baltimore\u2019s crime rate trend mirrored other major cities at that time; his statement does not provide that perspective.", "lang": "en"}
