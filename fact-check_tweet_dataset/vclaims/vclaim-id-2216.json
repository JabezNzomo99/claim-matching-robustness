Any truth to this? Is it true that Joel Osteen sailed his yacht through the streets passing out his book?\n\nOsteen\u2019s name had already worked through social media during and after Hurricane Harvey because of stories that Lakewood Church was not made available to people affected by the historic storm. The \u201cyacht\u201d claim originated with the Babylon Bee:\n\nAlthough Joel Osteen took flak over the weekend for closing up his church to flood victims and all but disappearing during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, the megachurch pastor reportedly returned to the city on his luxury yacht \u201cS.S. Blessed\u201d to make amends Tuesday by tossing copies of Your Best Life Now to stranded flood survivors. Osteen had his on-call yacht captain steer the large vessel through the flooded streets of the city, pulling up to survivors stranded on their roofs and on the roof of their cars as the prosperity gospel preacher smiled, waved, and threw out signed editions of the bestselling positive thinking book \u2026 Osteen also paused for brief photo ops with several families, the smiling pastor briefly allowing them to board his yacht as his professional photography team got shots of the pastor together with the sobbing, distraught flood victims, though the pastor was careful to not stand too close to the mud-caked refugees. Sources confirmed that the pastor then had his assistants help the families back into their makeshift lifeboats or tree logs on which they were floating through the city.\n\nOsteen and the Christian culture of which he is a part is a frequent target of Babylon Bee, but a disclaimer at the bottom of the page reads:\n\nAs is so often the case, the claim about Osteen\u2019s yacht voyage through a devastated Houston was copied to other sites, where it was not clearly marked as satire.", "lang": "en"}
