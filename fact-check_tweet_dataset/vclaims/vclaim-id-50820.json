It\u2019s unclear who is behind this website because it offers no contact information, but no evidence exists to indicate this site is owned or operated by Trump\u2019s official 2020 presidential campaign. Furthermore, the pictured hat doesn\u2019t appear to be a piece of official Trump merchandise. In other words, it seems that a third party doctored a photograph of a reality TV star in order to promote an unofficial piece of Trump memorabilia.\n\nA Trump campaign official told us: \u201cWe have nothing to do with the site and the hat is fake. We are preparing to take the usual legal action.\u201d\n\nThe original photograph of Jenkins, which featured an \u201cFXB\u201d hat, was posted to his Instagram account in September 2018:\n\nAt least one other doctored photograph appeared on the Conservative News Daily advertisement for this unofficial Trump 2020 hat:", "lang": "en"}
