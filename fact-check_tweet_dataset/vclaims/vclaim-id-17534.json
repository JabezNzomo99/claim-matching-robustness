The original photo, which does not include the burning flag, shows NFL player Michael Bennett leading the Seahawks in a victory dance.\n\nConservatives have been critical of the NFL ever since former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick inspired players to kneel or sit during the national anthem. The image directs ire towards the Seahawks, referring to the team as \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeattle Seahawks are not patriots to USA!\u201d the caption proclaims.\n\nHowever, the image shared by the Facebook page is photoshopped. The original image, posted to the team\u2019s Twitter account in January 2016, shows the players in their locker room engaging in a \u201cvictory dance.\u201d No flags are being burned.\n\nThere have been no reports of flag burning by the Seahawks.\n\nBennett, the player featured in the image, has been a prominent supporter of the anthem protests. After being traded to the New England Patriots in March, he said that he would remain in the locker room during the anthem instead of kneeling or sitting.", "lang": "en"}
