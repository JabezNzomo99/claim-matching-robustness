Did the Bharatiya Janata Party get voted as the fourth most corrupt party in the world in a survey conducted by CNN? We bring you a roundup of what did not actually take place this week.\n\nFACT: Based on an order from the Madras High Court, India's Department of Telecom reportedly asked ISPs to block online archive 'Internet Archive' or archive.org to prevent piracy of two recently released films \u201cLipstick under My Burkha\u201d and \u201cJab Harry Met Sejal.\u201d\n\nHowever, the ban is yet to be enforced by all internet service providers. BOOM was able to access archive.org at the time of writing this article.\n\nBACKGROUND: On August 8, several news outlets reported that the government had blocked access to Internet Archive in what they called \"an inexplicable move of internet censorship\".\n\nThe website is best know for its 'Wayback Machine' feature which allows access to archived digital content by creating a snapshot of what the page looked like at the time. This can be accessed even if the content is pulled down by a website subsequently.\n\nIt was BBC who first reported DoT's move was based on a high court order to clamp down on online piracy of the two movies. The order listed 2,650 websites, mostly file-sharing services but also included Internet Archive.\n\nCLAIM: BJP voted 4th most corrupt party in the world in a survey done by CNN\n\nFACT: No such survey was conducted. The story has been made up by a fake news site BBC News Point.

The news outlet deleted its story after being called out by BOOM on Twitter.

Even NASA has confirmed it\n\nFACT: The Perseid meteor shower will indeed peak on August 12 but it will not be as bright as day. NASA debunked the hoax in a blog\n\nBACKGROUND: A viral WhatsApp message claims there will be no night on August 12 because of the Perseid meteor shower.\n\nThe Perseid meteor shower occurs when the earth passes through the trail of dust and debris left behind by the comet Swift\u2013Tuttle, every August. That's right, every August!\n\nEven though August 12 will not be the greatest meteor shower of all time it is still expected to be a visual treat for stargazers.
