They are paid for doing so- translation). This statement has been attributed to Nepal Singh, a BJP MP.\n\nThe official handle of Mumbai Congress also posted about this statement, tweeting a Times of India article which quoted Nepal Singh.\n\nThe above post is by a Facebook page We Hate Na Rendra Mo Di. The infographic is by Viral In India, a popular page with a large following which mostly posts anti-BJP content and has spread misinformation in the past. The quote has also been shared by several individual users on Facebook as well as Twitter.\n\nWhile the statement has been correctly ascribed to Nepal Singh, BJP MP from Rampur, it was made last year i.e. in January 2018, and is NOT related to the recent terror attack in Pulwama. Singh\u2019s words had been covered extensively and had caused a massive furore, following which he had tendered an apology. In the video posted below, Nepal Singh can be heard uttering those controversial words. Incidentally, the backdrop of this statement was a terror attack which had taken place on a CRPF training camp in Pulwama on December 31, 2017 in which four CRPF personnel were martyred.\n\nWhile the BJP MP was unanimously criticised for his insensitive utterances and rightly so, the attempt to portray it as a recent statement in the wake of the Pulwama attack is mischievous and smacks of political opportunism.", "lang": "en"}
