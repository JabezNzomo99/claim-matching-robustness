In his initial deposition, he said: \u201cAgain, I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former vice president Biden or his son. Nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nBut David A. Holmes, political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, said he had heard Sondland speak to Trump after a meeting with Zelensky aides: \u201cDuring the lunch , Ambassador Sondland said that he was going to call President Trump to give him an update. \u2026 The President\u2019s voice was very loud and recognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume. \u2026 I heard President Trump then clarify that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland replied, yes, he was in Ukraine and went on to state that President Zelensky \u2018loves your ass.\u2019 I then heard President Trump ask, \u2018he\u2019s gonna do the investigation?\u2019 Ambassador Sondland replied that \u2018he\u2019s gonna do it,\u201d adding that President Zelensky will do \u201canything you ask him to.\u201d\n\nBut Holmes also testified that at the July 26 lunch he asked Sondland whether it was true that Trump did not \u201cgive a s--- about Ukraine.\u201d He said \u201cSondland stated that the president only cares about \u2018big stuff\u2019. I noted that there was \u2018big stuff\u2019 going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia, and Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant \u2018big stuff\u2019 that benefits the president, like the Biden investigation Mr. Giuliani was pushing.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he ever said he had a special assignment related to Ukraine, Sondland said: \u201cI was spinning a little, to be candid.\u201d But he framed it in terms of his discussions with Ukrainian officials. \u201cThe Ukrainians were very concerned that they weren\u2019t getting full support. \u2026 So when I said that the president gave me an assignment, it was really the secretary through the president.\u201d\n\nSondland initially said he could not explain a Sept. 1 text from the acting U.S. ambassador, William B. Taylor Jr., asking: \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Sondland replied by text, saying \u201ccall me.\u201d But he also initially did not remember a call, just that they \u201cprobably did\u201d have a call. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t know that we were discussing it,\u201d meaning a link between the security aid and the announcement of investigations.\n\nBut Taylor said he had heard from Morrison that Sondland had had a conversation with Andriy Yermak, a Zelensky aide, after the suspension of the security assistance became public. Sondland had not disclosed the conversation with Yermak in his initial testimony. \u201cThe security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation,\u201d Taylor said he was told. (Morrison recalls Sondland said it was sufficient for the prosecutor general, not the president, to make a public statement of an investigation.)\n\n\u201cIn the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement,\u201d Sondland said. He added he did not recall how he learned the statement would have to come from Zelensky himself, but he believed it may have come from Giuliani or Volker.\n\nNSC European affairs director Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman said that at a July 10 meeting, \u201cAmbassador Sondland relatively quickly went into outlining how the \u2014 you know, these investigations need to \u2014 on the deliverable for these investigations in order to secure this [White House] meeting [between Trump and Zelensky] \u2026 I heard him say that this had been coordinated with White House Chief of Staff Mr. Mick Mulvaney. \u2026 He just said that he had had a conversation with Mr. Mulvaney, and this is what was required in order to get a meeting.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
