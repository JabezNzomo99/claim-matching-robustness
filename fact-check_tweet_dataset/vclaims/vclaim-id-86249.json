His chief of staff, Annie Donaldson, recalled in an in FBI interview on or before April 2, 2018, that \u201cMcGahn told her the President had called and demanded he contact the Department of Justice and that the President wanted him to do something that McGahn did not want to do.\u201d McGahn did not tell her the reason but she figured it was because of the Russia investigation.\n\nMcGahn, who packed up his office, also informed White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Bannon he was resigning. \u201cPriebus recalled that McGahn said that the President had asked him to \u2018do crazy s---,\u2019 but he thought McGahn did not tell him the specifics of the President\u2019s request because McGahn was trying to protect Priebus from what he did not need to know,\u201d the report said. Priebus and Bannon both described the phone calls in FBI interviews in 2018, saying they had urged McGahn to stay.\n\n\u201cThe President then directed [White House staff secretary Rob] Porter to tell McGahn to create a record to make clear that the President never directed McGahn to fire the special counsel,\u201d the report said, citing an FBI interview with Porter on or before April 13, 2018. \u201cPorter thought the matter should be handled by the White House communications office, but the President said he wanted McGahn to write a letter to the file \u2018for our records\u2019 and wanted something beyond a press statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate. \u2026 Porter recalled the President saying something to the effect of, \u2018If he doesn\u2019t write a letter, then maybe I\u2019ll have to get rid of him.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe report adds: \u201cThe President\u2019s subsequent denials that he had told McGahn to have the special counsel removed were carefully worded. When first asked about the New York Times story, the President said, \u2018Fake news, folks. Fake news. A typical New York Times fake story.\u2019 And when the President spoke with McGahn in the Oval Office, he focused on whether he had used the word \u2018fire,\u2019 saying, \u2018I never said to fire Mueller. I never said \u201cfire\u201d\u2019 and \u2018Did I say the word \u201cfire\u201d?\u2019 The President\u2019s assertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed McGahn to have the special counsel removed thus runs counter to the evidence.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
