She sponsored the\n\nher bill proposed was compulsory counselling for women seeking abortion services and showing them ultrasound images of the foetus before the termination.\n\ncounselling, but it is not mandatory.\n\nIn May 2018 the\n\nDudley\u2019s bill as \u201cnot desirable\u201d. It said the changes would put abortion services out of the reach of those seeking them, and the proposed new services would be too expensive.\n\nBut does Dudley\u2019s claim of 200,000 abortions a year stand up to scrutiny?\n\nDudley told Africa Check that although the figure was \u201ca slight generalisation\u201d, it was supported by data from the department of health.\n\nParliament \u201cwill now and then ask questions of the department and they usually give provincial [figures] so they are not probably extremely accurate, but it does give a ballpark\u201d, she said.\n\nto her August 2017 request for the latest provincial data on abortion. This showed 14,934 abortions recorded in South Africa in the three months from April to June 2017. But it did not give annual figures.\n\nThe MP also provided an\n\ntitled \u201cAttitudes and intentions regarding abortion provision among medical school students in South Africa\u201d.\n\nthat there are \u201capproximately 200,000 total abortions\u201d annually in South Africa. Africa Check reviewed the five sources cited, but none contained the figure. (\n\nis \u201cnot familiar\u201d with the 200,000 abortions figure, Foster Mohale, its director for communication, told Africa Check.\n\nHe provided a breakdown of pregnancy terminations by province in the last three financial years. This listed 88,807 abortions in 2014/15, another 83,707 in 2015/16 and 105,358 in 2016/17.\n\nThis information was collected using the department\u2019s Web District Health Information System (or Web DHIS), Mohale said, and was grouped by \u201cage category (10-14, 15-19, above 20 years) and trimester of the pregnancy\u201d.\n\nIt was only captured from designated health facilities, which include approved private providers, he said. Provinces are by law responsible for approving these providers.\n\nSome of the conditions of certificate of operation include regular provision of termination statistics by the institution to the nearest district in which they operate.\u201d\n\nBut Whitney Chinogwenya, the marketing and brand manager of private provider\n\n, told Africa Check she \u201ccan\u2019t actually say if we are included or not\u201d as the department only reports totals.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a national guideline that is followed nationally,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat of the \u2018repeat\u2019 abortions claim?\n\nBoth Mohale and Chinogwenya said they couldn\u2019t speak to the accuracy of the claim that many women have more than one abortion in a year.\n\n\u201cIt is still a challenge to collect data on repeats; clients are not [necessarily] using the same facility,\u201d Mohale said. \u201cIf a client aborted in facility A, for a repeat she will go to facility B as a new client.\u201d\n\nChinogwenya said Marie Stopes\u2019s data \u201cdoes not track how many abortions a woman has had\u201d. She added that \u201cto give a figure on how many abortions were repeats is purely speculative\u201d.\n\nProf Rachel Jewkes is head of research strategy for the\n\n. She told Africa Check that, to her knowledge, \u201cthere has been no recent independent research\u201d on terminations in undesignated facilities and women having more than one abortion.\n\nConclusion: No data backs up MP\u2019s claim that 200,000 abortions, many a repeat, take place in SA annually\n\nTo convince South Africa\u2019s parliament to change the law that guides the termination of pregnancies, a parliamentarian said that 200,000 abortions take place each year, many of them \u201crepeats\u201d.\n\nBut none of the data Cheryllyn Dudley shared with Africa Check supported this claim. Government data - to which designated private providers are supposed to contribute - showed there were about half this number in 2016/17.\n\nFurther, we could not find data on illegal abortions or for women who have had more than abortion. We therefore rate the claim as unproven.\n\n\u201cMore information\u201d would help women seeking abortion services in South Africa to be \u201cfully informed\u201d, a parliamentarian seeking changes to the country\u2019s abortion law argued in March 2018.\u201cWith 200,000 abortions a year in South Africa - and many of these are repeat abortions; not a second, but a third, sometimes even a fourth - more information could help women make better choices re contraception and safer sex,\u201d Cheryllyn Dudley told parliament\u2019s portfolio committee on health.", "lang": "en"}
