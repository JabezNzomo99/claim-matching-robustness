Bruce Rauner\u2019s administration has faced a barrage of criticism for its response to a series of deadly Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreaks at the state-run veterans home in downstate Quincy.\n\nSpeaking last week to a group of state employees and lawmakers about the state budget in downstate Marion, Rauner tied extreme weather conditions in 2015 to the outbreak that killed 12 Quincy Veterans\u2019 Home residents that year and sickened dozens of others. Subsequent Legionnaires\u2019 outbreaks at the home sickened more residents.\n\n\"In 2015, we had massive floods and tornadoes,\" the governor said. \"The Mississippi River got a bunch of flooded water into it, a lot of dirt, and a whole bunch of Legionella bacteria, which are nasty water bugs \u2026 The Mississippi River is where the Quincy Veterans\u2019 Home gets its water. And bacteria got in all the old plumbing and we\u2019ve been treating it and heating it and filtering it and you can\u2019t get rid of all the bacteria, so now we\u2019ve got to rebuild it.\"\n\nRauner has been on the defensive over the Quincy situation ever since WBEZ, Chicago\u2019s public radio station, disclosed late last year that his administration kept residents of the home as well as the public in the dark for several days after that 2015 outbreak was first detected.\n\nThe flood theory isn\u2019t the first time Rauner has sought to deflect blame for the deaths on to an Act of God out of his control. And that raises two complementary questions we thought worth checking out: Could he be right? And if he is, so what?\n\nThe Quincy story continues to unfold against the backdrop of a heated election battle between Republican Rauner and Democrat J.B. Pritzker, so it stands to reason that the incumbent would be sensitive to allegations of fatally dropping the ball.\n\nEarly this spring, we rated as Mostly False a claim by Pritzker seeking to connect a recent outbreak at Quincy of stomach flu-like norovirus with the earlier Legionnaires\u2019 problems.\n\nA few months earlier, we rated as Half True an attempt by Rauner to explain away the Legionnaires\u2019 problems at Quincy by stressing that the bacteria lurks in most Illinois water systems. Experts said such contamination usually presents no threat unless water systems are poorly maintained.\n\nRauner\u2019s argument about floods and tornadoes comes in the same spirit as his water systems comment, but experts say it is even less grounded in fact.\n\nWBEZ followed up by reporting that neither Rauner nor his public health administration were able to cite any analyses directly linking flooding to the outbreaks, which returned in 2016, 2017 and again this year.\n\nAn array of experts, including federal health officials investigating the Quincy situation, also did not back up any flooding connection to the veterans\u2019 home problems.\n\nSo we asked Rauner\u2019s office for any further evidence. We also sought an explanation for why attempting to pinpoint a cause for the initial outbreak mitigated criticism of how the administration handled the crisis once it was discovered.\n\nSpokeswoman Rachel Bold said the administration is exploring various theories for both the cause of, and remedy to, the outbreaks, and pointed to several studies on the correlation between increased rainfall and a heightened risk of Legionnaires\u2019 disease. But she did not address our second question about the relevance of raising the flooding issue.\n\nWhich underscores a different, and likely more important, point.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush clearly was powerless to stop Hurricane Katrina from slamming into New Orleans in 2005. The problem for Bush was how slowly his administration reacted to a tragedy with broad and fatal consequences once winds subsided and the devastation became clear.\n\nSimilarly, not even Rauner\u2019s harshest critics have suggested he could have prevented the initial Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak in 2015. But lawmakers from both parties and political opponents have blasted his administration for delays in responding to the crisis and possibly making it worse.\n\nRauner vehemently disagrees, and it\u2019s not our purpose here to weigh in on who is right or wrong on that score. What is significant, however, is whether the trigger for the outbreak in any way affected the response, and the governor has provided no evidence for that being the case.\n\nWhile speaking to state employees and lawmakers about Illinois\u2019 budgetary priorities, Rauner claimed \"massive floods\" led to a deadly Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreak that hit the Quincy Veterans\u2019 Home during his first year in office.\n\nHis administration was unable to cite any analysis specific to Quincy to demonstrate that link, and federal health experts who have investigated the Quincy situation have made no such connection, either.\n\nMore to the point, criticism of the governor in respect to Quincy centers not on what led to the initial Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak but how slow his administration was to respond while seniors were sickened and many died. The governor\u2019s statement appears to be an effort to deflect blame.\n\nRauner\u2019s Act-of-God claims about the source of Legionnaires\u2019 are unverified and off-point. For that, we rate his statement False.", "lang": "en"}
