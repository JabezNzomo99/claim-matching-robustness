No, that is not true. A search of databases in Wisconsin and Illinois reveal that another, older man by the same first and last name has a record that is falsely being attributed to the 17-year-old Rittenhouse in social media posts. The Kyle H. Rittenhouse accused in the Kenosha shootings has minor traffic citations in Wisconsin. The only other charges against him stem from the Aug. 25, 2020, shootings.\n\nThe Rittenhouse criminal history claim appears in a post (archived here) published on Facebook on Aug. 26, 2020. The post read, in part:\n\n17 year old Kyle Rittenhouse-Lewis' mom Wendy drove him and his AR-15 rifle from Antioch, IL to Kenosha WI to \"defend\" businesses that he does not own from riots. \n\n He ended up shooting 3 people, 2 died and 1 lost his arm. \n\n\n\n Since some people are always quick to pull up shooting victims prior criminal history in order to justify their ill fate, I thought I'd post the shooters instead.\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThis post, which shows a picture of Rittenhouse in a police cadet uniform, along with his mother, is false on at least two fronts.\n\nFirst, there is no evidence revealed by investigators that Rittenhouse's mother provided his transportation to Kenosha, site of a protest against racial injustice in the wake of Jacob Blake, 29, getting shot seven times by police on August 23.\n\nSecond, the post gives an inacurate picture of Rittenhouse's past by combining the information of a 31-year-old man with the same first and last names, but a different middle name.\n\nHere is how the rest of the post read:\n\nHis prior criminal history, \n\nIn 2018, he has a charge for disobeying officers.\n\n\n\n2016\n\n\n\nCase Number: 2016CM000410\n\nCase Type: MISDEMEANOR\n\nClassification: MISDEMEANOR CLASS A\n\nCounts: 1\n\nCrime Type: MISDEMEANOR\n\nDegree Of Offense: MISD.

Instead they're calling him a \"patriot\" and started a GoFundMe account for his legal fees.\n\nThe listed cases in the post do not belong to the 17-year-old charged in the August 25 shootings. As the below screenshot shows, most belong to Kyle Joseph Rittenhouse, who was born in April of 1989, is 31 and lives in Clinton, Wisconsin. The 17-year-old accused shooter is Kyle Howard Rittenhouse, born in January of 2003, from Antioch, Illinois.\n\nThe traffic citations from August 19 do belong to alleged shooter Rittenhouse, who lives in Antioch, about 20 miles from Kenosha. He is currently being held in Illinois, according to Lake County, Illinois court records, pending a September 25 hearing on his transfer to Wisconsin to face charges in the killings. The August 27 case refers to the killings of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26. Also wounded in the shooting was Gaige Grosskreutz, 26\n\nAccording to the Wisconsin Circuit Court website, Rittenhouse currently faces two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, one count of first-degree reckless homicide, two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety and one count of possession of a dangerous weapon by someone under age 18:\n\nThere is no evidence, as suggested in the post, that Grosskreutz has lost his arm. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that, in fact, he should be able to keep his arm, though he will need reconstructive surgery to repair it. A family friend told the paper that he \"lost his bicep.\"", "lang": "en"}
