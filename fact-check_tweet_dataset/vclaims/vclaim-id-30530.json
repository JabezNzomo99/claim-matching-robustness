Bush signed 11 executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\u2022 President Clinton signed 13 executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\u2022 President George H.W. Bush signed 11 executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\u2022 President Reagan signed 18 executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\u2022 President Carter signed 16 executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\u2022 President Nixon signed 15 executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\u2022 President Johnson signed 26 executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\u2022 President Kennedy signed 23 executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\u2022 President Eisenhower signed 20 executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\u2022 President Truman signed 25 executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\u2022 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed nine executive orders during his first 100 days.\n\nThe curious thing about this is that Roosevelt is listed as signing only nine executive orders. The American Presidency Project, a website maintained by the University of California at Santa Barbara, shows Roosevelt as signing 3,721 during his presidency, for an average of 307 a year.\n\nIn reality, Roosevelt signed 99 executive orders in his first 100 days, or more than three times Trump\u2019s tally. But only nine of those orders are displayed on the website, said John T. Wooley, a UCSB professor who helps run the site. (The actual orders can be found on the website of the FDR library.) It\u2019s apparent that not all of the executive orders are listed because there are gaps in the numbers. (h/t to professor Peter A. Shulman who first pointed this out on Twitter.)\n\n\u201cWe have the complete text of EOs ONLY starting with Truman, so counts of our docs prior to 1945 are incomplete,\u201d wrote Wooley in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be relied on by the WH; sorry they were confused \u2014 and maybe didn\u2019t read all of our explanatory notes. Bad for both of us.\u201d\n\nIt turns out the website FiveThirtyEight back in January also made the same error, which is in part where the White House got its information. Julia Azari, a professor at Marquette University who wrote the article, said that she will correct the article. The American Presidency Project also added a \u201cspecial note\u201d at the top of the page on executive orders.\n\nA White House official acknowledged the count for Roosevelt\u2019s executive orders was wrong. But he asserted that despite the mistake, the general point is correct because the news release said that Trump has signed more executive orders than any president since Roosevelt.\n\nWhile the news release says that Truman signed 25 executive orders in his first hundred days, the actual number is 57, if you count from when Truman took office after Roosevelt\u2019s death in 1945. The White House official said that the figure was based on Truman\u2019s first full term, after he was elected in 1948. That\u2019s the same standard as used by FiveThirtyEight.\n\nThis is obviously a major error in a news release and the White House should issue a corrected news release, either with the right number or Roosevelt\u2019s name removed. As we noted before, Roosevelt remains the gold standard for presidential action in the first 100 days, even for executive orders.", "lang": "en"}
