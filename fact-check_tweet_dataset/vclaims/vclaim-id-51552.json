A cursory search shows the article was published by site n5ti.com on April 25.\n\nThe fabricated report was debunked by the UK Department of Health and Social Care and several fact-checking organizations in at least three continents shortly after the site published the falsehood.\n\nDr. Granato herself gave proof of life on April 26 in a personal tweet and a video interview with British Broadcasting Network (BBC) medical correspondent Fergus Walsh. She has been active on Twitter and gave a talk in a virtual conference on microbiology on Aug. 12.\n\nThe University of Oxford\u2019s official website for the vaccine trial also issued a warning on April 26 about false updates on the research, urging the people not to circulate them. It also told the public that all official updates about the trial will appear on their site.\n\nThe Oxford Vaccine Trial began on April 23 and was the \u201cfirst human trial in Europe of a coronavirus vaccine\u201d according to a BBC report. Granato is one of the first two participants in the trial.\n\nDeveloped by Oxford\u2019s scientists, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Results of Phase I and II of the trial have been published, indicating \u201cno early safety concerns and induces strong immune responses in both parts of the immune system,\u201d according to a news release on July 20.\n\nVERA Files Fact Check has flagged 10 FB posts carrying the screengrab of the untrue story this month. It began circulating about five days after President Rodrigo Duterte said on July 30 he hopes the Philippines will be \u201cback to normal\u201d by December, thanks to a vaccine from China, he said.\n\nThe false FB posts also received a boost in shares as news that Russia had developed a COVID-19 vaccine called 'Sputnik V' which it would share with the Philippines made headlines.\n\nLocal health officials are now in talks with the Russian vaccine maker about conducting Phase III clinical trials here.", "lang": "en"}
