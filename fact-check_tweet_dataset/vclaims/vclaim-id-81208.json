However, we found that the screenshot in circulation is fake and that it had never been published by the news outlet. According to the screenshot, the news report by News18 claims that the article was published on 20 August and said that 5,371 students who sat for the COMEDK UGET exam had tested positive for coronavirus, while 8,456 had been quarantined. The screenshot also appears to say that 57 grandparents and parents of the students had died of the disease.

We also found no credible reports of any such related news either. Further, we noticed that the headline and whatever portion that could be seen of the article had multiple errors which would not have been allowed in a news report published by News18. While the headline itself did not make sense grammatically, \u2018With\u2019 is capitalised for no reason, \u2018qurantined\u2019 is a glaring spelling mistake and spacing is a problem. Moreover, the sentence below the headline does not make sense grammatically, \u2018covid 19\u2019 is missing a capital letter and \u2018deaths students onfire\u2019 does not fit logically into the sentence. Moreover, we found the exact article by News18, also about COMEDK UGET 2020, which had been used to make the fake screenshot. We noticed that the fake screenshot had the same hero image as this article, the same date of publishing, the same time of updating and the same byline.\n\nBoth articles were headlined COMDEK UGET 2020, were updated on \u2018August 20, 2020\u2019 at 4:56 PM IST and had been written by Trending Desk. Therefore, it is clear that a screenshot of a real article by News18 was morphed to make it seem that they had reported that many people had died, been tested positive or quarantined due to COVID-19.", "lang": "en"}
