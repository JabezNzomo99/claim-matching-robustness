The claim is false; the image was doctored to include the halal stamp.\n\nThe misleading image was shared on Facebook here on July 9, 2019, and here on July 11, 2019. The same photo was also posted to Facebook here, where it was shared more than 7,000 times before it was removed.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post published on July 9, 2019:\n\nThe Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSo delicious...it is also halal...hahahaha.\u201d\n\nOn the top left corner of the package, the two Indonesian words translate to English as: \u201cPork Crisps\u201d.\n\nA drawing of a pig can also be seen on the package, with the word \u201ccap\u201d written above translates to English as \u201cbrand\u201d and \u201cBABI\u201d, below it, which means \u201cpig\u201d.\n\nThe text in red below translates to English as: \u201cMeat and quality guaranteed. Without preservatives and flavoring\u201d.\n\nA halal logo can also seen on the top right of the label, in black.\n\nEating pig products is prohibited in the Islamic faith, as explained here.\n\nThe image in the misleading posts has been doctored. A keyword search on Google found the pork crisps shown in the photo for sale in a number of online shops, for example oleholehkhasbali.com, on the Hindu-majority Indonesian resort island of Bali.\n\nHowever, there is no halal label on the crisp packets sold via the shop, as seen in the screenshot below:\n\nThe owner of the crisp factory in Bali\u2019s Tabanan district, Made Dharma Putra, confirmed to AFP by phone on July 16, 2019, that he had never registered his product to Indonesia\u2019s halal certification agency.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible for me to register the product. It is clear the product is made of pork and the drawing of a pig can be seen in the package. It is made for non-Muslims,\u201d he said.\n\nUPDATED: this fact check was updated 23/07/2019 to change the description of Bali's Tabanan from \"town\" to \"district\" second paragraph from end.", "lang": "en"}
