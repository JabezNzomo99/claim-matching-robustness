However, a public acknowledgement of this fact would mean a rupture of the U.S. relationship with Kabul. But Washington has invested about $700 billion in the Afghan campaign over the last 15 years and is not ready to lose its investments,\" RT wrote on the Russian-language version of its website, which also posted a video on the subject.\n\nHowever, the Russian-language version of the video omitted an entire section that was included in a piece on the subject published August 1 on RT\u2019s English-language website. That piece discussed a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) on the issue of child sexual abuse by Afghan military. RT also failed to note that this SIGAR report was the catalyst for recent news reports on child abuse in Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S. Congress created SIGAR to \u201cprovide independent and objective oversight of Afghanistan reconstruction projects and activities\u201d supported by U.S. funding in Afghanistan. SIGAR investigates Afghanistan reconstruction projects and activities in order to prevent abuse, fraud, and waste.\n\nSIGAR stated in its quarterly report to the U.S. Congress published on July 30 that it had issued a classified evaluation of the Defense and State departments implementation of the Leahy Law as it pertains to Afghanistan. The Leahy Law is a U.S. human rights law -- named after its principal sponsor, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) -- prohibiting the State and Defense departments from assisting foreign military units if there is credible information those units have committed gross human rights violations.\n\nAccording to SIGAR, the classified evaluation \u201cconcerns allegations of sexual abuse of children committed by members of the Afghan security forces\u201d and \u201cdiscusses the extent to which the U.S. holds Afghan security forces accountable.\u201d\n\nThus, SIGAR\u2019s latest quarterly report contradicts RT\u2019s claim that the United States has not publicly acknowledged the problem of child sexual abuse by Afghan military and that it disregards human rights violations in Afghanistan.\n\nIn addition, SIGAR is calling on U.S. Defense Department to release the classified report to the public. Moreover, SIGAR\u2019s quarterly report, citing the latest annual trafficking-in-persons report issued by the State Department, says that \u201cthe Afghan government does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so.\u201d\n\nAccording to State Department\u2019s June 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report, the Afghan government enacted a new law on human trafficking in January of this year. Among other measures, the law criminalizes the practice of bacha baazi, \u201cin which men exploit boys for social and sexual entertainment.\u201d\n\nThe State Department report noted that the Afghan government convicted traffickers, including officials complicit in bacha baazi, but overall failed to meet the minimum standards in several areas.\n\n\u201cAfghan officials remain complicit, especially in the sexual exploitation and recruitment of children by Afghan security forces,\u201d the SIGAR report notes, citing the State Department\u2019s assessment.\n\nU.S. Defense Department spokesperson Adam Stump said \u201ceach case [of child rape] requires a factual and legal review to determine whether it is a credible allegation of a gross violation of human rights under the Leahy Law.\"", "lang": "en"}
