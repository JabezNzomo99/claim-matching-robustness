It was only in 2000 that he petitioned for recognition of Filipino citizenship and was issued a certificate of recognition as a Filipino citizen in 2002.\"\n\nThe same claim was echoed in a Facebook post by the page VOVph on Thursday, May 28. Both the text and the graphic in the post say the following: Eugenio \"Gabby\" Lopez III, was an American citizen when he took the helm of the company in 1987. It was only in 2000 that Lopez petitioned for recognition of Filipino residency.\"\n\nLopez is a Filipino citizen because his mother and father were both citizens of the Philippines. He is considered a naturalized citizen, which is defined in the same Constitution as \"citizens of the Philippines from birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect their Philippine citizenship.\" This includes children of Filipino mothers, who elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority.\n\nArticle XIV of the US Constitution states, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\n\n\"He's a Filipino under Philippine law, clearly, but because he was born in the US, under US laws, he's also an American citizen,\" said lawyer and former Supreme Court spokesperson Ted Te on the issue.\n\nThe question, then, said Te, would be whether Lopez has done anything that might be interpreted as a loss of citizenship under Philippine law, such as taking an oath that renounces every other citizenship.", "lang": "en"}
