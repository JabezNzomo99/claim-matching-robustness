On taking a closer look at the screenshot, one can see that the news ticker in the Mirror Now screenshot is missing which is not the usual pattern of the news channel.\n\nWhile there are glaring inconsistencies in the first template itself, there is another graphic template which is being circulated on social media which also reads the same news.\n\nWhile the sentence structure is wrong even in this one, it goes on to add a mug (photograph) of one of their reporters to add authenticity to their news. According to the flashing graphic a reporter called \u2018Pramod Madhav\u2019 reported on this story. But on looking on the internet, we found out that the same reporter has been reporting on the flood situation in Kerala for the last few days.\n\nHours after the news credited to Mirror Now went viral, Faye DSouza, the editor of the news channel, issued a tweet calling it false. In her tweet, Faye said \u201cThis is a fake screen. FALSE . Photoshopped\n\n1. The bottom ticker is missing\n\n2. The font is not the one used by the channel\n\n3. This is not a story carried by @MirrorNow\u201d\n\nShehla Rashid also tweeted saying that the screenshot has been photoshopped and is fake. \u201cWarning: There are photoshopped images of a @MirrorNow screen being circulated with the caption that animal slaughter has been banned in Kashmir. I checked with Mirror Now. They deny having run the story. Looks like a trap by the ruling party to discredit Kashmiris.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
