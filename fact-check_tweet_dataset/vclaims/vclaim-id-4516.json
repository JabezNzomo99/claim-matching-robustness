One of the more prominent purveyors of this particular celebrity death hoax has been the fake news web site MSMBC.co (deliberately titled so as to cause confusion with the genuine news site MSNBC.com), which on 21 February 2015 published a false report claiming the famous musician had passed away, then updated their hoax article again on 11 April 2015 and started a new round of the fake Willie Nelson death rumor:\n\nLegendary country music star Willie Nelson was found dead today in his Maui home. He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelson\u2019s death first circulated early April 11, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson\u2019s property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911. \u201cThere was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,\u201d said Det. Aldeson. \u201cDetermining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,\u201d said County Coroner Frank Shultz. \u201cIt\u2019s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.\u201d The shocking news comes just days after a recent \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview where Nelson was quoted as saying \u201cLife is good and I have never felt better or been happier.\u201d\n\nThe fake MSMBC.co article unfortunately fooled many readers as it made the rounds of social media again, even though it was completely false and was just a recycled version of the very same prank the site released months earlier. The latter part of the article\u2019s statement that the \u201cstory is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified,\u201d is technically correct, as nothing about the story has been \u201cofficially verified\u201d because none of it is even remotely true.\n\nNo legitimate news outlet has reported on Nelson\u2019s death, which is not surprising since the 84-year-old music star is actually alive and well, still commenting on current political issues and singing about how he\u2019s not really dead:\n\nWillie Nelson may be getting old but he is so done with the death rumors. Two days before the singer turned 84, (Saturday, April 29,) he released a timely new music video for his song \u201cStill Not Dead,\u201d from his newest album, \u201cGod\u2019s Problem Child.\u201d Nelson first sings in the toe tapping tune, \u201cI woke up still not dead again today. The internet said I had passed away.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
