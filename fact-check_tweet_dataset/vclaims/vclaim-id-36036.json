The video shows a semi-conscious girl in a pool of blood while people surrounding her are heard asking each other to call the ambulance and police.\n\nFacebook page Free Kashmir\u2019 shared the video with the caption, Indian army shot down a Kashmiri student. If world cannot resist on such brutalities, it's better to close UNO and all the other organisations made to bring justice and peace. (The video not attached as it shows grim violence towards a minor)\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video has nothing to do with Kashmir. The video is from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh where a jilted lover shot a school girl in her legs in December last year.\n\nThe post, shared by Free Kashmir\u2019 on Sunday, has been shared more than 600 times till the time of filing this story. This page is followed by almost 4,500 Facebook users.\n\nWith a combination of InVID tool and keyword search, we found the viral video in a Zee News report. As per the report, on December 3, 2018, a jilted lover named Jitu fired four bullets in the legs of a Class 9 girl in Qutub Sher area of Saharanpur.\n\nJitu was arrested on December 7 and he reportedly told police that he was having an affair with the girl but her family had arranged her marriage with someone else. This made him angry and he shot four bullets at the girl\u2019s leg so that she becomes disabled and her marriage is cancelled.\n\nWe also found a Dainik Bhaskar report describing the same incident.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that an old video from UP has been passed off with the misleading claim that Indian Army shot down a Kashmiri student.", "lang": "en"}
