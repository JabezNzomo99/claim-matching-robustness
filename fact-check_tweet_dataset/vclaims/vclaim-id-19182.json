The commission was disbanded without having found any such evidence.\n\nMore recently, Trump claimed in August 2019 that he had only lost out to Clinton in New Hampshire in 2016 because the state was \u201ctaken away\u201d as a result of \u201cthousands and thousands of people coming in from locations unknown [to vote in New Hampshire].\u201d He did not cite or provide any evidence to support those claims.\n\nIn the days following that latest baseless allegation of voter fraud, a letter was shared on social media that purported to have been written by Ellen Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission, and addressed to Trump. It prompted multiple inquires from readers about its authenticity and provenance.\n\nThe letter, from a relatively important federal official to the sitting U.S. president, was unusually combative and is worth quoting from in full:\n\nBack in February 2017, when you first alleged a voter-fraud scheme of astonishing scale in New Hampshire in 2016, I publicly called upon you to provide your evidence to the American people and the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that your very serious claims could be investigate. I followed up in March 2017 with a letter to you repeating my request. You have not, so far, provided any proof of these allegations. Last night, you repeated your claim: \u201cNew Hampshire should\u2019ve been won last time,\u201d you told reporters before your rally, \u201cexcept we had a lot of people come in at the last moment, which was a rather strange situation, thousands and thousands of people, coming in from locations unknown. But I knew where their location was.\u201d During your rally, you told the crowd that New Hampshire was \u201ctaken away from us.\u201d What I wrote to you in March 2017 is just as true now: Our democracy depends on the American people\u2019s faith in our elections. Your voter-fraud allegations run the risk of undermining that faith. Just as seriously, baseless allegations of fraud have been used to rationalize indefensible laws that deter certain U.S. citizens from exercising their right to vote. Words matter, and facts matter. The American people count on me, as the Chair of their Federal Election Commission, to protect the integrity of our elections. So I ask you, once again, to provide any evidence you may have to the American people and the appropriate law-enforcement authorities to substantiate your claims. The American people are ill-served when our leaders put forward unfounded allegations of voter fraud. To put it in terms a former casino operator should understand: There comes a time when you need to lay your cards on the table or fold.\n\nThe letter was authentic. Weintraub even posted it to her verified Twitter account on Aug. 16:\n\nThree days later, Weintraub discussed her letter and its contents in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper:", "lang": "en"}
