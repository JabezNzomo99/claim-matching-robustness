{"title": "The Benjamin Netanyahu Twitter hack that never was", "subtitle": "Politicians and celebrities have had their accounts hijacked but not, apparently, Benjamin Netanyahu.", "author": "www.bbc.com", "date": "2020-07-23T14:08:00.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-54266", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53433894", "vclaim": "As many celebrities and politicians had their Twitter accounts hacked on Wednesday in an apparent Bitcoin scam, the site was flooded with screenshots of their bogus messages asking for cryptocurrency donations.\n\nThe tweet translates from Hebrew: \"I give back to my community because of Covid-19! All the Bitcoin that will be sent to my address below, will be sent back doubled. If you send $1,000 I will give back $2,000! I am doing this only in the next 30 minutes! Enjoy.\"\n\nThe Israeli embassy in London told the BBC: \"The tweet in question was not tweeted from the official account of the prime minister. We believe it must be fake.\"\n\nThe BBC has found no evidence the tweet ever appeared on Netanyahu's timeline, and the message itself seems to have been shared only as a screenshot, with no link to his Twitter account or the tweet in question.\n\nIn the aftermath of the London Bridge attack in November last year, a fake tweet allegedly authored by the then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested he sympathised with the attacker who was shot dead by the police.\n\nTwitter has been investigating this latest security breach and, so far, found that hackers had targeted 130 accounts in total and were able to send tweets from 45 of those.\n\nHow can you separate real from fake?\n\nIt comes as little surprise that during the chaos of this Twitter hack, fake screenshots of public figures being targeted by the same Bitcoin scam came to light.\n\nComparing the screenshot with the other real tweets from big public figures was the best way of identifying fakes. The same identical message was tweeted in English repeatedly - so messages in another language, or with any changes to the phrasing would be suspicious.", "lang": "en"}
