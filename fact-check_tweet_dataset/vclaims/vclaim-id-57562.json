The videos show pre-coordinated military equipment movements unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nVideos of trains carrying military vehicles in various cities have been circulating on Facebook and Twitter along with claims that the equipment movements signal a national quarantine and martial law are soon to follow. The claims come amid viral rumors of the federal government instituting such measures in response to the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Facebook page Cannabis Planet, whose video contained Bradley Infantry Vehicles, claimed in a post, \u201cTanks heading north from San Diego \u2013 Quarantine & Martial Law could indeed be next,\u201d while Twitter user @Terrence_STR claimed, \u201cMilitary equipment being moved into Chicago\u2026 Prepare for complete lockdown soon.\u201d\n\nOther social media users have made similar claims with images and videos they say were taken in other states, such as New Jersey and Florida.

The National Security Council previously debunked the notion in a March 15 tweet, and President Donald Trump has said he is not currently considering either at this time.

Colonel Emanuel Ortiz, an Army spokesman, said in an email. \u201cThese are normal, pre-coordinated supply-train movements unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ortiz, those pre-coordinated shipments include military equipment moving through San Diego, which is near military installations such as Naval Base San Diego, Camp Pendleton and North Island Naval Air Station.\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman explained on Twitter that the videos with the Chicago skyline in the background show military equipment being moved from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n\n\u201cTo confirm what others have pointed out: these are new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles being transported by @USArmy Materiel Command from the factory in Oshkosh to Fort Bragg, NC,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThese deliveries by train to our bases nationwide are not infrequent and have nothing to do w COVID-19.\u201d\n\nMembers of the U.S. military have been deployed to help combat the U.S. coronavirus outbreak in some states. For instance, the Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort has been dispatched to New York Harbor to treat non-coronavirus patients in the New York City area, according to Politico.", "lang": "en"}
