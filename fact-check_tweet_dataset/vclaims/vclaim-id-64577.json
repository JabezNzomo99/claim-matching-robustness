But experts say that although UV light can be used against the virus, it can also damage unprotected eyes and skin, while the ad linked to a webpage that falsely claimed endorsement from US health authorities and a doctor.\n\n\u201cThe virus is HIGHLY transmissible and easily spread. Masks and the \u20186 feet rule\u2019 are not effective,\u201d said the text of the July 6, 2020 ad, referring to social distancing aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cAre you doing EVERYTHING you can to protect your family? If you dont have this, then you aren\u2019t,\u201d said the ad, which was later removed.\n\nThe novel coronavirus -- which has killed more than 584,000 people worldwide since it emerged in China in 2019 -- has provided fertile ground for false information, as well as opportunities for those seeking to profit off widespread fear of COVID-19, the disease it causes.\n\nThe ad also included a short video that claimed the product \u201celiminates 99.9% of viruses and bacteria in just 10 seconds.\u201d\n\nBut experts say UV light can pose a risk to users if it is used to disinfect bare skin, as pictured on a webpage linked to in the ad.\n\n\u201cAny UV light source powerful enough to disinfect viruses would come with a substantial risk of causing skin cancer,\u201d Dr. Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses who chairs the Biological Sciences department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cThis is a very bad idea to use near people,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while UV could be used to disinfect surfaces, \u201cthe risk is that reflected UV light could still cause damage to skin cells, so it is probably not a thing you would want to use without some kind of eye and skin protection,\u201d he said.\n\nThe video included in the ad showed a person without any visible protection using one of the wands.\n\nDr. Julian Leibowitz, an expert in coronaviruses who is a professor of microbial pathogenesis and immunology at Texas A&M\u2019s College of Medicine, made a similar point.\n\n\u201cYou can kill coronaviruses with UV but using it on your hands is a bad idea and I doubt that 10 seconds is adequate,\u201d he said by email, referring to the claim in the ad that the product would be effective in less than that amount of time.\n\nThe World Health Organization also specifically warns that UV lamps \u201cshould NOT be used to disinfect hands or other areas of your skin.\u201d\n\nThe ad was linked to a Facebook page run from Italy called Super Charged Cleaning that was created on June 20 but has now been removed. It said that: \u201cThe number one best selling UV-C light is finally here. Protect your family from harmful germs in a matter of seconds.\u201d\n\nThe ad included links that intermittently directed to either a webpage that provided further details about the UV wands, or one selling \u201cCITRUS SCENTED ALL-PURPOSE CLEANER.\u201d\n\nThe webpage that focused on the UV wands contained multiple false claims, including that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urges people to use UV light to protect against the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cCDC Urges US Households To Use UV-C Light To Protect Their Families From The Second Wave,\u201d the webpage said.\n\nBut the CDC said via email that \u201cthe efficacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light against COVID-19 virus is not known.\u201d\n\n\u201cCDC only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identified on List N against the virus that causes COVID-19,\u201d it said.\n\nThe webpage also claimed the UV wands were endorsed by Dr. Wesley Long, medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist, quoting him as saying: \u201cI have personally bought the Super Charged UV-C wand. It has been lab tested independently and is made in the United States.\u201d\n\nThis too is false.\n\n\u201cDr. Long did not say these things nor did he ever use this product and does not endorse it,\u201d Lisa Merkl, a spokeswoman for Houston Methodist, said by email.\n\nAnd the webpage said that the UV wand was named \u201cbest home sterilizing product 2020\u201d by \u201cU.S.A. Consumer Report,\u201d a possible reference to Consumer Reports, an organization that provides independent reviews of products.\n\nBut \u201cConsumer Reports has not reviewed or written about UV wands, nor does such an accolade exist,\u201d its director of communications, Barrie Rosen, said by email.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 560 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
