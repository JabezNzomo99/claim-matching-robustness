Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Funeral procession video of the pregnant elephant that died in Kerala. Fact: Video shown in the post is a combination of two different videos. While the video at the beginning is related to the funeral of a bull in Karnataka, the latter part shows the funeral of an Elephant in Tamilnadu from 2018. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn Extracting the screenshots from the video and reverse searching them, we get to know that two different videos used to make this video.\n\nThe latter part of the video (Image Video-1 above) is related to the funeral of an Elephant named \u2018Rukku\u2019 that belongs to Arunachaleshwar Temple in Thiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu), which died in 2018 due to an injury. Reverse image search led to a video posted by Tamil news channel, Puthiyathalaimurai TV on their youtube channel. A keyword search led to articles published by media that reported the death of this Elephant. These can be read here and here.\n\nThe other part of the video which is shown at the beginning is related to the funeral of a bull in Karnataka. When this video alone went viral earlier as the funeral procession of the pregnant elephant in Kerala, Factly has debunked this claim, which can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, funeral procession videos of an elephant in Tamil Nadu and a bull in Karnataka are edited and falsely shared as funeral procession video of the pregnant elephant from Kerala.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
