It amused the hell out of me while it was happening. I hope it isn't one of those \"had to be there\" things. On my way home from the second job I've taken for the extra holiday ca$h I need, I stopped at Taco Bell for a quick bite to eat. In my billfold is a $50 bill and a $2 bill. That is all of the cash I have on my person. I figure that with a $2 bill, I can get something to eat and not have to worry about people getting mad at me. Me: \"Hi, I'd like one seven layer burrito please, to go.\" Server: \"Is that it?\" Me: \"Yep.\" Server: \"That'll be $1.04, eat here?\" Me: \"No, it's \"TO-GO\" [I hate effort duplication] At this point I open my billfold and hand him the $2 bill. He looks at it kind of funny and ... Server: \"Uh, hang on a sec, I'll be right back.\" He goes to talk to his manager, who is still within earshot. The following conversation occurs between the two of them: Server: \"Hey, you ever see a $2 bill?\" Manager: \"No. A what?\" Server: \"A $2 bill. This guy just gave it to me.\" Manager: \"Ask for something else, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A $2 BILL.\" Server: \"Yeah, thought so.\" He comes back to me and says: Server: \"We don't take these. Do you have anything else?\" Me: \"Just this fifty. You don't take $2 bills? Why?\" Server: \"I don't know.\" Me: \"See here where it says legal tender?\" Server: \"Yeah.\" Me: \"So, shouldn't you take it?\" Server: \"Well, hang on a sec.\" He goes back to his manager who is watching me like I'm going to shoplift. Server: \"He says I have to take it.\" Manager: \"Doesn't he have anything else?\" Server: \"Yeah, a fifty. I'll get it and you can open the safe and get change.\" Manager: \"I'M NOT OPENING THE SAFE WITH HIM IN HERE.\" [My emphasis] Server: \"What should I do?\" Manager: \"Tell him to come back later when he has REAL money.\" Server: \"I can't tell him that, you tell him.\" Manager: \"Just tell him.\" Server: \"No way, this is weird, I'm going in back.\" The manager approaches me and says: Manager: \"Sorry, we don't take big bills this time of night.\" [It was 8pm and this particular Taco Bell is in a well lighted indoor mall with 100 other stores.] Me: \"Well, here's a two.\" Manager: \"We don't take those either.\" Me: \"Why the hell not?\" Manager: \"I think you know why.\" Me: \"No really, tell me, why?\" Manager: \"Please leave before I call mall security.\" Me: \"Excuse me?\" Manager: \"Please leave before I call mall security.\" Me: \"What the hell for?\" Manager: \"Please, sir.\" Me: \"Uh, go ahead, call them.\" Manager: \"Would you please just leave?\" Me: \"No.\" Manager: \"Fine, have it your way then.\" Me: \"No, that's Burger King, isn't it?\" At this point he BACKS away from me and calls mall security on the phone around the corner. I have two people STARING at me from the dining area, and I begin laughing out loud, just for effect. A few minutes later this 45 year old-ish guy comes in and says [at the other end of counter, in a whisper]: Security: \"Yeah, Mike, what's up?\" Manager: \"This guy is trying to give me some [pause] funny money.\" Security: \"Really? What?\" Manager: \"Get this, a two dollar bill.\" Security: \"Why would a guy fake a $2 bill?\" [Incredulous] Manager: \"I don't know? He's kinda weird. Says the only other thing he has is a fifty.\" Security: \"So, the fifty's fake?\" Manager: \"NO, the $2 is.\" Security: \"Why would he fake a $2 bill?\" Manager: \"I don't know. Can you talk to him, and get him out of here?\" Security: \"Yeah ...\" Security guard walks over to me and says: Security: \"Mike here tells me you have some fake bills you're trying to use.\" Me: \"Uh, no.\" Security: \"Lemme see 'em.\" Me: \"Why?\" Security: \"Do you want me to get the cops in here?\" At this point I was ready to say, \"SURE, PLEASE,\" but I wanted to eat, so I said: Me: \"I'm just trying to buy a burrito and pay for it with this $2 bill.\" I put the bill up near his face, and he flinches like I was taking a swing at him. He takes the bill, turns it over a few times in his hands, and says Security: \"Mike, what's wrong with this bill?\" Manager: \"It's fake.\" Security: \"It doesn't look fake to me.\" Manager: \"But it's a $2 bill.\" Security: \"Yeah?\" Manager: \"Well, there's no such thing, is there?\" The security guard and I both looked at him like he was an idiot, and it dawned on the guy that he had no clue. My burrito was free and he threw in a small drink and those cinnamon things, too. Makes me want to get a whole stack of $2 bills just to see what happens when I try to buy stuff. If I got the right group of people, I could probably end up in jail. At least you get free food.", "lang": "en"}
