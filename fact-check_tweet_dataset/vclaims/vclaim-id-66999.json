Parked cars are seen being swept away by the tremendously overflowing water, as it floods the area within moments. The user has filmed the video from the rooftop of a building. \n\n\n\nThe video is also doing the rounds with a caption which takes a dig at China based on a unverified narrative that the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is manmade and was created in a lab in Wuhan. The translated caption reads, \"China sent the virus and betrayed the world. Now God is betraying it (China).\" Original text in Hindi: \u091a\u0940\u0928 \u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0938 \u092d\u0947\u091c\u0915\u0930 \u0926\u0941\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u094b \u0927\u094b\u0916\u093e \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0905\u092c \u090a\u092a\u0930 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0909\u0938\u0947 \u0927\u094b\u0916\u093e \u0926\u0947 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948) Click here to view one such post and here for an archive.
