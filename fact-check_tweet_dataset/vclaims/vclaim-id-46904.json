Sources revealed the bat-biting Black Sabbath frontman is in such dire straits he didn\u2019t even realize his wife, Sharon, missed the holidays with him for the first time in 40 years. \u201cOzzy is in chronic pain and begging to be put out of his misery!\u201d an insider said. \u201cHe\u2019s in such bad shape that he didn\u2019t even notice Sharon wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nThis article was not based on medical reports or first-hand knowledge from the singer\u2019s family. Rather, it relied on anecdotal information from an anonymous \u201cinsider.\u201d Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s daughter, on the other hand, directly refuted this report.\n\nOsbourne did have some medical issues in 2019. After a fall in his home that aggravated an old injury, the singer had to undergo surgery. Osbourne also had a bout with pneumonia and cancelled several concerts due to health reasons.\n\nKelly Osbourne acknowledged that her father had a difficult 2019, but said that reports about him being on his deathbed were wrong.\n\n\u201cToday I had a wonderful start to 2020. Then spent the rest of the day laughing and hanging out with my dad. \u201cI come home to read sickening articles about my dad supposedly being on his \u201cdeath bed.\u201d Sometimes the media makes me sick!!! \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that my dad has had a rough year when it comes to his health but come the FUCK on this is utter bullshit.\u201d\n\nOsbourne\u2019s band Black Sabbath also refuted Radar Online\u2019s claim. The band took to Facebook after several fans expressed concern for the singer\u2019s health. The band wrote that the article was \u201cso very fake.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to the singer for comment and will update this article if more information comes available.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Radar Online has published an article claiming the singer was near death. In October 2019, the outlet claimed he was on a \u201ccrazy train to early death.\u201d When Sharron Osbourne, Ozzy\u2019s wife, was asked about that article, she said that \u201cit\u2019s not [true] by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow cold and callous are those headlines? Where\u2019s people\u2019s empathy? It\u2019s not [true] by any stretch of the imagination. I\u2019ve been open with everyone and so has Ozzy \u2026 He had a terrible, terrible bout of bad luck with his health, one thing after another\u2026 And then after his fall that he had, it\u2019s been awful for him. But he\u2019s getting better.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his daughter, wife, and band all refuting this report, the heavy metal singer just released a new single and has a tour scheduled for 2020.", "lang": "en"}
