(RELATED: Has Nigeria Received Coronavirus Vaccines From China?)\n\nBut, contrary to the caption\u2019s claim, the photo doesn\u2019t show children negatively affected by vaccine trials. Taken by photographer Jean-Marc Giboux for the World Health Organization (WHO) more than 20 years ago, the photo shows polio survivors in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.\n\n\u201cI shot this picture in Sierra Leone in 1998, and they are children victims of polio, who never got vaccinated and didn\u2019t get reconstructive surgery,\u201d Giboux told the Daily Caller in an email. \u201cThis (sic) kids were orphans, living at the Cheshire Home for Physically Handicapped Children in Freetown, Sierra Leone. They were not victims of a vaccine, they were handicapped because they didn\u2019t get vaccinated against polio.\u201d\n\nThe WHO confirmed to AFP Fact Check that Giboux was on contract for the organization when he took the photo. Another picture of children wearing the same style of clothing appears on Giboux\u2019s website under the project category \u201cPolio.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that over 1.5 million childhood deaths have been prevented worldwide since 1988 thanks to polio vaccinations. Despite a global effort to eradicate polio, the disease continues to affect children and adults in parts of Asia and Africa, according to the Mayo Clinic.", "lang": "en"}
