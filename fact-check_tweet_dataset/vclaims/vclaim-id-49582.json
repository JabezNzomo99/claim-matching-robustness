Many of these warnings are no more than unsubstantiated rumors or urban legends, as we have examined in detail on many occasions over the years.\n\nIn early 2019, an incident involving an Uber driver in Tampa, Florida, went viral on Facebook, stoking the fears of millions of readers, as Facebook user Emmy Hurley wrote on 19 February:\n\nLast night I was picked up by an Uber. Same car, female driver. I MADE A MISTAKE. I got in before checking, as she opened the back door for me from her seat. She drove erratically and didn\u2019t speak. About 10 minutes in, my actual Uber called me asking where I was. My voice cracked, because in that instant I knew. \u201cA car\u2026 I think I need help.\u201d She told me not to hang up and to get out of the car however I possibly could. The lady refused to stop or respond to me. I told her she was driving by my friends (random girls I saw) and they would call the cops. She slowed a little, pointing at her phone saying \u201cUber. I take you back then.\u201d I said, no here is fine. She kept going. I booked it out the door, car still moving. She sped off. I later found out she is a sex traffic worker. They use women to lure people in, and possibly hang out in the Uber lot to steal rides of similar looking cars. The cops didn\u2019t come, but my real Uber driver did, and hugged me, kept me safe, and cried with me. Always, always check your Uber. I\u2019m lucky.\n\nThe claims contained in Hurley\u2019s post, that she had been the victim of an attempted kidnapping perpetrated by a \u201csex traffic worker,\u201d appeared to be corroborated in another Facebook post later that day, this time by a woman who presented herself as Hurley\u2019s intended Uber driver, Cristin Cinquino, who wrote:\n\nLast night I was doing what I always do, waiting in the lot to get a ride. My phone goes off with a ride from Uber and it\u2019s a girl, she says she\u2019s there waiting. I tell her where to go and tell her i\u2019m [on my way] to get her. I pull up and she\u2019s not there. I called, no answer, called again, no answer, called again, still no answer\u2026 something told me not to just mark her as a no show and leave, so I called one more time and she answered. I asked her where she was and she said \u201cwho is this?\u201d I said \u201cit\u2019s cristin, your uber driver\u201d, the next 5 min was the LONGEST, SCARIEST 5 min of my life\u2026 she said back to me, \u201ci think I got in a car that\u2019s not an uber, I NEED HELP.\u201d I listened on the other end, helplessly, while this girl is crying, begging the driver to let her out. The driver wouldn\u2019t turn around and look at her and kept yelling at her to calm down and saying \u201ci\u2019m uber driver\u201d in a foreign accent. The driver wouldn\u2019t stop and was not headed to her destination, she got off the interstate at the Port of Tampa exit (likely headed to a warehouse near the port or directly to a boat where they ship all these victims away) I told her whatever she does, do NOT hang up the phone and that I didn\u2019t care if the car was moving, leave your stuff and jump out of the car. She finally saw some people walking and told the driver they were her friends and she was on the phone with them and they would call the cops. The driver slowed down and she jumped out and ran. I\u2019m still on the phone this whole time telling her to run as fast as she can and find somewhere she can go inside. I made it to her to pick her up a few minutes later, she got in my car and I hugged her and we cried for a few minutes. I\u2019m pretty sure this woman was watching me and when she saw me get a ride on my phone, she left before me, in the same type of car, and picked up my rider. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, ask your drivers name, tell them to tell you your name, and check the license plate number!!!! It was late, she was tired as her flight was delayed a few hours and made a mistake that likely almost cost her her life.\n\nCinquino\u2019s post was deleted on 20 February, but an archived version can be read here. Her version of the story further fueled its spread, adding the ominous specter of \u201ca warehouse\u201d and \u201ca boat where they ship all these victims away,\u201d as well as claiming that Hurley had almost lost her life in the incident.\n\nIn reality, both Hurley\u2019s and Cinquino\u2019s accounts were false. Hurley did enter the wrong Uber at Tampa International Airport on 18 February, but she was the victim of no more than what Tampa police called a \u201csimple mix-up\u201d and not a life-threatening, attempted kidnapping linked to a sex-trafficking operation.\n\nIn response to our inquiries, a spokesperson for Tampa Police Department clarified what actually happened, writing in an email that:\n\nA woman visiting Tampa posted on Facebook on Tuesday [19 February] that she got into the wrong car at the airport, believing it to be her Uber driver. Our investigation indicates that is exactly what happened. However, there is no evidence to support the woman\u2019s statement posted on social media that she later \u201cfound out she is a sex traffic worker.\u201d Tampa Police has contacted everyone involved. The driver of the car in question is a legitimate Uber driver who was at the airport to pick up someone else. The driver\u2019s primary language is Spanish. The language barrier, and the fact that the woman got into the wrong car, led to confusion. Unfortunately, that also led to inaccurate conclusions that were then posted on social media.\n\nWe asked Tampa Police Department whether they had any evidence of a more general recent or ongoing pattern of attempted or successful kidnappings involving Uber or taxi drivers, and in particular incidents related to sex trafficking. The spokesperson was clear in the response: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any credible information that reveals a trend or pattern of attempted or completed kidnappings involving ride-share drivers or taxi companies within our jurisdiction.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
