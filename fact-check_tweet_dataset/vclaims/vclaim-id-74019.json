Kamala Harris was the Alameda County district attorney when Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old black man, was shot and killed in Oakland, California.\n\nThe district attorney of Alameda County at the time was Tom Orloff, not Harris. The officer that shot Grant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nReferenced in the image is \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d a 2013 film that features actor Michael B. Jordan as Grant, an unarmed 22-year-old black man who was fatally shot in the back by a white Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) police officer on an Alameda County train platform on New Year\u2019s Day in 2009. Grant and other passengers had been taken off the train after reports of fighting, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe image falsely alleges that Harris, the presumptive Democratic vice presidential nominee, was the district attorney overseeing Grant\u2019s case, seemingly in an attempt to criticize her record on criminal justice.

His office charged Johannes Mehserle, the BART officer that shot Grant, with murder, but Mehserle was ultimately convicted of involuntary manslaughter, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAccording to California\u2019s Department of Justice website, Harris served as district attorney for San Francisco County from 2004 until 2010, meaning Grant\u2019s case was outside her jurisdiction. She became the attorney general of California in 2011, per the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nWhile Harris did spend time working in the Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s office, it was more than a decade before Grant was killed. She worked in the office from 1990 until 1998.", "lang": "en"}
