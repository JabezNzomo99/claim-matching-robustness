This is false; the ex-president has publicly rejected the claims and said he has no reason to leave the party.\n\nMultiple posts shared on Facebook link to articles claiming that Jonathan \u201cmade this known while speaking with journalists in Abuja\u201d. One version of the report published by the website iReporteronline has been shared more than 1,900 times by multiple Facebook pages, according to data from social media tracking tool CrowdTangle.\n\nAnother Facebook page, News Across The Nation, posted the same claim -- published on a different website -- with a caption that states that the ex-president revealed this to \u201cNigeria news agency\u201d in Abuja.\n\nThere\u2019s no news organisation by that name in Nigeria, and the fake name appears intended to sound like the state-run News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). News of Jonathan\u2019s supposed exit from frontline politics was not carried in any reputable mainstream publication.\n\nThe websites that did carry the false claim about Jonathan quitting the PDP -- Mystatenews and NaijaLiveTv along with iReporteronline -- publish a mixture of factual news and inaccurate reports.\n\nBut on Sunday Jonathan\u2019s media advisor Ikechukwu Eze confirmed that the former president remains a member of the PDP, calling the claim that he had quit \u201ca fabrication borne out of mischief\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no way the former President could have spoken to a non-existent news agency, as none in the country goes by that name,\u201d Eze added in a post on Jonathan\u2019s verified Facebook Page.\n\nJonathan was Nigeria\u2019s president from 2010 to 2015, representing the PDP. Before that, he was deputy to president Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, who died in 2010 after a protracted illness.\n\nThe false reports about Jonathan quitting politics bear a resemblance to those last weekend about Gbenga Daniel, a former governor of Ogun state in southwest Nigeria and director-general of the PDP presidential campaign organisation for the just-concluded 2019 election.\n\nDaniel announced that he was quitting the PDP and withdrawing from active politics after 18 years in the party.\n\nBut his move had nothing to do with Jonathan, who has now made it clear that he remains a member of the PDP.\n\nJonathan has been on the receiving end of misinformation in Nigeria. A few days after he launched his book, My Transition Hours, which detailed his last days in government, fake copies of the book containing stories different from the original were already online and in stores. Also, a few days before the presidential elections, posts circulated on social media claiming Jonathan had told journalists that his party\u2019s choice for vice-president in the 2019 election \u201cwas a monumental disaster\u201d. AFP checked, and found Jonathan said no such thing.", "lang": "en"}
