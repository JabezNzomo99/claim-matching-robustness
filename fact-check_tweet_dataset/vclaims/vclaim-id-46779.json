Valid I.D.s are not required to participate in the 2020 Census.\n\nThe federal government conducts a census every ten years to count the entire U.S. population, including non-citizens and illegal immigrants. Census takers sometimes go door-to-door in neighborhoods to verify addresses, collect survey responses, drop off census materials and conduct quality checks, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than 1,000 times, claims that robbers are going door-to-door disguised as \u201cofficials\u201d from the \u201cDepartment of Home Affairs\u201d to confirm people have valid identification for the 2020 Census. It features an alleged photo of an \u201cUrgent Community Notice\u201d for Jersey City, New Jersey residents.\n\nThrough a quick internet search, the Daily Caller discovered that the Census Bureau has debunked this \u201cUrgent Community Notice\u201d as a hoax on its website.\n\n\u201cThis is a hoax that originated overseas,\u201d reads the Census Bureau website. \u201cThe truth is, census employees are in neighborhoods across the country as they prepare for the next year\u2019s census. However, census employees are not asking the public for any identification.\u201d\n\nNo valid I.D. is required to take the 2020 Census, and no \u201cDepartment of Home Affairs\u201d exists within the federal government.

In South Africa, the Home Affairs Department manages immigration and distributes identification documents, among other functions.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Department of Home Affairs has also debunked the claim as a \u201csocial media scam\u201d on Twitter.\n\n\u201cBesides not asking the public for any identification, the Census Bureau will never ask you for your Social Security number, your bank account information, your credit card numbers, or for money and/or donations during the 2020 Census,\u201d reads the Census Bureau website.\n\nCensus takers identify themselves as Census Bureau employees, show their Department of Commerce identification badges and have briefcases with the bureau\u2019s logo when they go door-to-door, according to the Census Bureau.", "lang": "en"}
