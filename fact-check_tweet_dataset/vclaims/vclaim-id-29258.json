A video posted by Facebook page Secret Indian TV\u2019 claims to reveal the truth behind Maggi. It further says flavour enhancer used in packaged food is made from pig fat.\n\nThe video was viewed around 6.3 lakh times and shared by more than 9,000 accounts on Facebook.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this claim to be misleading.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe video titled in Hindi Maggi Khaate Ho Sach Ko Failao\u2019 (if you eat Maggi then share the truth) starts explaining how pork is being used to enhance the flavour of Lay\u2019s chips and other products such chocolates, corn flakes and packed food. It then goes on to explain how pig fat was used since the 18th century.\n\nNowhere in the video it directly talks about Maggi, though the claim clearly targets the noodles brand. However, the link between the claim and the video apparently lies in the flavour enhancer part which has been stressed upon in the viral video.\n\nThe post says flavour enhancers were coded by international brands so that they could add pig fat slyly. Certain flavour enhancers such as E631 and E635 come from animal fat (E631 particularly from pig fat) which are used in packaged food like Lay\u2019s and Maggi, the viral post claimed.\n\nHowever, this claim is not new. A simple search on Google yields multiple results where people have claimed the same thing basing their evidence on the flavour enhancer E631/E635.\n\nAFWA has found that none of these claims came from authentic or verified sources.\n\nIt\u2019s true that flavour enhancers E635 (Disodium 5'-ribonucleotides) and E631 (Disodium inosinate) are generally made from animal fat, however, they are not the only source of their production.\n\nNestle has elaborated in its FAQ section that the E635 enhancer that they use in Maggi comes from beetroot and yeast extracts. Lay\u2019s had also clarified in the past that the flavour enhancer E631 comes from tapioca starch, which means that both these flavour enhancers are plant products.\n\nThe Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has made it mandatory for companies to put a green and red dot on vegetarian and non-vegetarian edibles. Maggi bears a green dot on all its packets (except the chicken flavour). In January 2019, the FSSAI had said Maggi was safe for human consumption.\n\nHence, the claim that flavour enhancers come from animal fats does not stand its ground.", "lang": "en"}
