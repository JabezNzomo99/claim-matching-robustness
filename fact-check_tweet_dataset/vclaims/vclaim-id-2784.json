Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!\"\n\nThe facts: The sector is far from devastated.\n\nFederally insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported more than 5 percent growth in the third quarter from a year earlier. Of more than 5,700 institutions reporting, more than two-thirds (67 percent) had year-over-year growth in quarterly earnings. The proportion of unprofitable banks fell. Quarterly net earnings also were up in the second quarter.\n\nSimilar earnings growth \u2014 4.9 percent \u2014 was reported in 2016. As well, litigation expenses \u2014 one possible sign of distress \u2014 were down by almost $3 billion at a selection of large banks.\n\nThere's also a longer term measure of health: The Fed says 34 financial firms have added more than $750 billion in capital since 2009. That capital essentially is held in reserves that would help the companies weather a future crisis like the 2008 financial meltdown that prompted the bureau's creation in 2011 and other steps to overhaul the financial sector. Critics of the bureau say it is overbearing. But it has not left the industry in ruins.\n\nThe financial crisis was caused largely by reckless lending practices that led millions of Americans to lose their jobs and homes. The Trump administration has argued that the bureau has blocked people's access to loans and credit, although surveys by the Federal Reserve do not find that to be so.", "lang": "en"}
