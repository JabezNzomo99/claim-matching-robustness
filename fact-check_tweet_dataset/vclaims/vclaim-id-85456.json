He clearly wanted to emphasize Trump\u2019s interest in saving the beleaguered coal industry, which has lost market share (and tens of thousands of jobs) to the increasing popularity of natural gas. In fact, he used this statistic to rebut as \u201cdead wrong\u201d an interviewer\u2019s question about whether Trump was making a \u201cfalse promise\u201d to the coal industry.\n\nBut according to an EPA spokeswoman, Pruitt bungled the line on one show and did not accurately express it on other shows. (He kept saying \u201csince the fourth quarter,\u201d which sounds like the end of the year, when she said he meant to say since October.) But even if he had gotten it right, it still would have been deeply misleading.\n\nOn \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Pruitt flatly stated that almost 50,000 jobs have been added in the coal sector. Many readers asked about this claim, noting that there are only about 50,000 jobs in coal. Here\u2019s the Bureau of Labor Statistics data on coal jobs. As you can see, it has been in a tight range for months, with a slight gain. In the last four months of the Obama administration, September to January, there was a gain of 1,400 jobs. In the first four months of the Trump administration, there has been a gain of 1,000 jobs, according to preliminary estimates.\n\nOn the other programs, Pruitt more carefully referred to \u201cmining and coal\u201d or \u201ccoal jobs, mining jobs.\u201d You can see how he tries to slip in the word \u201cmining.\u201d That\u2019s a sign that this is a carefully crafted spin. He emphasizes coal while trying to be technically correct by slipping in a reference to mining.\n\nBut the biggest problem with Pruitt\u2019s statistic is that most of the gain in \u201cmining\u201d jobs has nothing to do with coal. Most of the new jobs were in a subcategory called \u201csupport activities for mining,\u201d which accounted for more than 40,000 of the new jobs since October and more than 30,000 of the jobs since January. Here\u2019s that BLS data:\n\nThe plunge in oil prices that started in 2014 wiped out nearly 200,000 jobs in the oil and gas support sector by October, but a recent stabilization in oil prices has helped bring some of those jobs back. It has little to do with administration policy \u2014 and nothing to do with coal mining.\n\nSo, rather than the gain of 47,000 jobs touted by Pruitt, the reality is that 1,000 coal jobs have been added since Trump became president. For the month of May, the gain was 400 jobs, not 7,000. (Update: the final numbers were lower: 800 coal jobs since Trump became president, and 200 in the month of May.)\n\nWe should note that coal industry officials believe the BLS figures for coal mining are too narrow because they do not include support personnel under \u201ccoal mining.\u201d The industry would argue that the number should be about 62 percent higher \u2014 81,000 rather than 50,000, as of the end of 2016. (An Energy Department report suggests the figure, including professional support jobs, is closer to 74,000.) That suggests coal mining support jobs represent about 11 percent of the \u201csupport for mining\u201d total jobs. So perhaps 3,000 or 4,000 of the gain in support jobs could be attributed to coal, although the evidence suggests most of the growth is in the oil and gas sector.\n\nWe don\u2019t try to play gotcha, and it\u2019s clear that Pruitt completely flubbed his talking point on one TV program. But he still uttered misleading spin on other news programs, trying to take advantage of the BLS job labels to suggest that there has been a huge gain in coal/mining jobs, in part by reaching back months before Trump came to the White House. The data is not made up out of whole cloth, but the claim is so tortured that it screams.", "lang": "en"}
