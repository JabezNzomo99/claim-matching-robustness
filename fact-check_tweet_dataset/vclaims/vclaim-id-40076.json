Charter, claiming that commitment to universally recognized international legal principles is one of Russia\u2019s \u201cinternational political backbones.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Russia\u2019s has been responsible for some of the most flagrant violations of international law in recent history -- the invasion and control of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula and part of its Donbas region since 2014.\n\nLavrov cited the United Nations Charter \u2013 which states in Article 2, point 4: \u201cAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Ukraine, Russia has violated this part of the U.N. Charter. It has also violated two international agreements guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity. These were the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the Russian-Ukrainian Friendship Treaty of 1997.\n\nInternational law is complex, and many U.N. member states, including the U.S., have been accused of violating it. However, Russia\u2019s recent actions in Europe, which hasn\u2019t seen a major conflict since 1999, refute the idea that it is committed to observing international law.", "lang": "en"}
