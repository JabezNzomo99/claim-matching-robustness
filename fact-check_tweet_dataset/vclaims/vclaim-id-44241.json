His name is Irfan Pathan). The post has garnered 78,000 views, 31,00 shares and 666 likes so far.\n\nThe same post with exactly the same caption has been shared by many other Facebook users too.\n\nOn January 14, 2020, Irfan Pathan had shared a similar video of a crowd of youngsters on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nPathan has also posted the same video from his verified Tik-Tok handle.\n\nPathan\u2019s attire in the videos is the same. Although the 13-second video does not show the man sitting behind or the car very clearly but a glimpse of Trinamool Congress leader Madan Mitra is visible.\n\nAlt News checked Mitra\u2019s Twitter account and found that he shared photographs with Pathan that same day.\n\n\u201cSome beautiful moments with ex-India cricketer par excellence Irfan Pathan for Kamarhati Premier Knock-Out cricket tournament organised by Kamarhati Development Society. Truly a moment to cherish to meet the man who is grace and humbleness personified,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHence, it is evident that the video is from Pathan\u2019s visit to Kamarhati on the northern fringes of Kolkata on January 14, 2020, and not from Shaheen Bagh.", "lang": "en"}
