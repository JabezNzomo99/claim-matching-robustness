It is also being claimed that the Indian Army used four boys as human shields against the stone pelters. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: On 16th August 2019, four boys were used as human shields by the Indian Army against the stone pelters in Jammu & Kashmir.

None of the official sources has confirmed the involvement of the Indian Army in this incident. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, it was found that the same video was tweeted by a journalist on his Twitter Account in June-2018. So, it can be concluded that it is an old video.\n\nWhen searched for news articles on this issue, articles published by Jansatta, AajTak and Times of India on this incident in June-2018 can be found in the search results. None of the news reports confirmed the involvement of the Indian Army in the incident. In an article published by Scroll, it was found that the J&K police have denied their involvement whereas an Indian Army official said that they were trying to find out the facts.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video of security forces allegedly using a human shield against stone pelters is being shared as a recent incident\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
