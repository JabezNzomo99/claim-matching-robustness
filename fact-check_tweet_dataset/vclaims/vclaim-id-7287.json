Within these groups the post generated a combined total of 355 interactions as of August 17.\n\nThe Senate conducted the random drug test following Sotto's surprise announcement at the flag-raising ceremony on July 30. He said he was reminded of the Senate\u2019s \u201ccommitment to a drug-free environment and workplace.\u201d\n\nSenators can opt out of the testing. It is only mandatory for rank-and-file employees. It was also the first time the Senate uses a more stringent 5-panel test which detects all illegal drugs.\n\nSotto led the first batch to be tested. Aside from Trillanes, also tested were Senators Gregoria Honasan II, Paolo Benigno \u201cBam\u201d Aquino IV, Loren Legarda, and Miguel Zubiri. At least 400 out of the 1,700 Senate personnel were also tested. The Office of the Senate President said the results will be released in the next few weeks.\n\nThe blog post\u2019s sole content is a YouTube video of Sotto checking the equipment to be used for the testing, and the flag raising ceremony. It was uploaded by channel, \u201cPro Duterte Ka Ba?\u201d\n\nFrom April 24 to August 17, the said YouTube channel had 7 videos used by dubious posts Rappler has checked. Examples are Sotto supposedly saying the ethics complaint against Trillanes is \u201ctop priority\u201d and Senator Leila de Lima may get the death penalty once capital capital punishment is reimposed in the country. \u2014 Miguel Imperial/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
