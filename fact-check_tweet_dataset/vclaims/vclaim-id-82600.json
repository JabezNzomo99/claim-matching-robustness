Sahu's account now stands deleted from Instagram.\n\nWhile the identity of the perpetrators largely remained a mystery last week a few posts on social media insinuated that the perpetrators were Muslims.\n\nBOOM contacted Hampi police who rubbished such posts and said those arrested are Hindus and there is no communal angle.\n\nSpeaking to BOOM, Arun Rangarajan, Superitendent of Police, Ballari district said the arrested youngsters are Ayush Sahu who hails from Madhya Pradesh and the other three are from Bihar - Raj RA, Raja Babu Chaudhury and Rajesh Chaudhry.\n\n\"Sahu works for a digital firm in Bengaluru and is the one who shot the video and uploaded it on his Instagram account. Raj Babu is a daily-wage worker at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and RA Raja is an engineering student studying in Bengaluru,\"Rangarajan said. He added that the men claim they were in Ballari to appear for a railway recruitment examination and decided to visit Hampi post the same.\n\nWhen asked why the youngsters vandalised the site by pushing down the pillars, Rangarajan said, \"The youngsters claim they were unaware that it was a heritage structure. There is no communal angle to the incident and all posts claiming so are wrong and misleading.\"\n\nHowever, it is not clear when the vandalism took place as ASI and the police differ on a timeline.\n\nRangarajan added that while the ASI maintains that the video is a year old at least, the fact-finding by the police and the statement of the youngsters are contrary to the ASI findings. \"The youngsters have said they were in Hampi this year but the ASI findings show the video is an year old. The matter of when the incident happened is still being investigated,\" he said.", "lang": "en"}
