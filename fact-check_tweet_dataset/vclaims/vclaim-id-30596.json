The text is overlaid onto an image of an intravenous drip bottle hanging from a stand.\n\nThe post has been viewed more than 30,000 times and has attracted more than 1700 likes and 100 comments.\n\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. It is a new strain in the coronavirus family \u2013 a group of viruses which also the SARS and MERS respiratory infections. Coronaviruses can be transmitted between animals and humans.\n\nAccording to the WHO, plague is a specific infectious disease caused by a bacteria called Yersinia pestis. The bacteria is usually found in small mammals and their fleas and can be transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissue or inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.\n\nProfessor Basil Donovan, an expert on infectious diseases at the University of NSW Faculty of Medicine, told AAP FactCheck the word \u201cplague\u201d could also mean a very large outbreak or an epidemic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a formally defined term. The trouble with wordplay, it\u2019s got an emotional overlay. It has no meaning in medicine,\u201d Professor Donovan said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a scientific term. It\u2019s good for clickbait. It doesn\u2019t add any meaning to anything.\u201d\n\nOn January 30, 2020, the WHO convened its Emergency Committee to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) over the global outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus.\n\nThe declaration of a PHEIC by the WHO signifies \u201can extraordinary event\u201d that requires a coordinated international response.\n\nWHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the main reason for the declaration is \u201cnot because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill prepared to deal with this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe post also claims 340,000 people are infected and 75,000 people have been killed by the coronavirus in China.\n\nAccording to the latest WHO coronavirus update on February 3, 2020, there have been 17,391 confirmed cases globally with 17,238 confirmed cases in China.\n\nThe WHO have also confirmed 361 deaths from the coronavirus outbreak within China and one death outside China, in the Philippines.\n\nThe latest figures from the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China (NHC) reported at 3am (AEST) on February 4, 2020 that 20,438 cases had been confirmed in the country. (use English translation)\n\nAccording to the Wuhan Coronavirus Global Cases reporting tool created by Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the tally of confirmed cases on mainland China stood at 20,001 with 426 confirmed deaths as of 12pm (AEST) February 4, 2020.\n\nAll three sources put the total tally for people infected in China well under the figure of 340,000 claimed in the Instagram post.\n\nThe Instagram user who posted the January 31 post shared an identical image on January 29, 2020, with that post\u2019s caption including the word, \u201cCap\u201d. According to dictionary.com\u2019s slang dictionary, \u201ccap\u201d comes from the slang expression \u201cno cap\u201d which means \u201cno lie\u201d or \u201cfor real\u201d to \u201cemphasise someone is not exaggerating about something hard to believe\u201d.\n\nUrban Dictionary also defines \u201cThat\u2019s cap\u201d as a term used for when someone\u2019s actions are \u201cunexceptional\u201d or \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nThe original post appears to have been posted on a Twitter account. AAP FactCheck searched Twitter using the Advanced Search tool for the phrase but could not locate the original tweet.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Instagram post to be false. While the WHO has declared the 2019 coronavirus outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, it has not deemed the outbreak as a \u201cplague\u201d. Also the number of infections and deaths globally are far below the numbers claimed in the post. Although the Instagram user labelled the claim in their first upload with \u201ccap\u201d, potentially indicating the post was false, many users appear unaware the post contains false information. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate.", "lang": "en"}
