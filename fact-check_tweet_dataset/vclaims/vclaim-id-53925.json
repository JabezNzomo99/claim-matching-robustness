Bernie Sanders became a subject of interest, especially among those who labeled him a \u201csocialist.\u201d\n\nOne item of particular scrutiny was the notion that Sanders owned three homes, one of which, according to a popular meme, was an opulent mansion with panoramic views of Vermont\u2019s Green Mountains:\n\nSanders does indeed own three properties, but none of them is the stately manor pictured above.\n\nThe senator\u2019s main residence in Vermont is a colonial four-bedroom house in Burlington, which he purchased in 2009 for a reported $405,000. He also owns a one-bedroom 1890 row house in Washington, D.C., just a few blocks from the Capitol, which he bought for a reported $489,000. As well, he owns a lakefront cabin in North Hero, Vermont, purchased for a reported $575,000 in 2016.\n\nThose dwellings are pictured in the following Facebook post:\n\nThe residence pictured in the \u201cHey morons\u201d meme, however, is a completely unrelated 15,460-square-foot estate in Stowe, Vermont, which was built in 2001 and boasts four bedrooms and nine bathrooms on 15 acres:\n\nGreen Mountain Estate on 15 acres boasting panoramic views, custom finishes, and innovative home technology. This 4-bedroom home with 6 full and 3 partial bathrooms includes a master sanctuary with exercise room and 3 large guest suites.

Custom finishes throughout include exotic woods, Bottocino and Carrera marble, and handcrafted suspended staircase, with exterior of the home finished in prized Danby, Vermont marble, and on-demand snow melt system. Located in charming Stowe, Vermont hear world-famous Von Trapp Family Lodge and Stowe Mountain Resort.\n\nThis residence was last sold in August 2017 for just under $3 million, an amount much greater than Sanders\u2019 estimated net worth.", "lang": "en"}
