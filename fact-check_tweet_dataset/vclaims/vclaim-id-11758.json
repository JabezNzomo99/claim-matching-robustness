Since then, the post garnered at least 4,500 reactions, 4,300 comments, and 7,600 shares.\n\nThe claim was also posted by hatawtabloid.com in March 2017.\n\nThis claim was sent by a reader to Rappler for verification.\n\nThe facts: Hontiveros has not filed any bill supporting the claim.\n\nThe senator has debunked the claim already in her Facebook post on March 13, 2017.\n\nA search in the Senate\u2019s website shows there is also no such bill filed by Hontiveros in the current 17th Congress.\n\nRecently, the House of Representatives has approved House Bill 8683 which lowers the optional retirement age for government employees from 60 to 56. Its principal author was ACT Teachers party-list Representative Antonio Tinio.\n\nThis is not the first time Rappler has checked false claims involving Hontiveros or laws involving senior citizens.
