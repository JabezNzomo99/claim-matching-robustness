In 2010/11, the basic state pension for an individual was around \u00a35,080 per year. It is currently around \u00a36,550\u2014an increase of about \u00a31,470 in cash terms.\n\nBut this figure doesn\u2019t account for the fact that prices have also risen over the last eight years, meaning with the same sum of money today, you can\u2019t buy as much as you could eight years ago\u2014an effect known as inflation.\n\nFactoring that in, since the Conservatives have been in government the basic state pension has increased by around \u00a3550 in today\u2019s money.\n\nWhat do pensioners actually receive?\n\nChange to the state pension isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s impacted pensioner incomes over this time. Changes to the level of things like benefits and private income have also had an effect.\n\nBetween 2010/11 and 2017/18 the income of the average \u201cpensioner unit\u201d increased by \u00a3936 in real terms per year before taxes. That\u2019s an increase of around 3%.\n\n(A pensioner unit is either a single pensioner or a couple of whom at least one is above pension age.)\n\n\n\nOf that \u00a3936, \u00a3416 was down to increases in state benefits (including but not limited to the state pension) while the rest was due to other incomes including private or occupational pensions.\n\nSo since 2010/11, the average pensioner unit has seen an increase in their income of around 2% before taxes as a result of government changes to benefits.", "lang": "en"}
