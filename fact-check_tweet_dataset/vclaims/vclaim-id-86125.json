That survey found that from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017, the percentage of U.S. adults without insurance rose from a record-low 10.9 percent to 12.2 percent. \u201cThat 1.3 point increase represents an estimated 3.2 million Americans who entered the ranks of the uninsured in 2017,\u201d Gallup said in a news release.\n\nBut that does not put Obama in the clear. He could have also cited a report known as the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The NHIS found an increase of only 700,000 uninsured people from 2016 to 2017 \u2014 what the report called \u201cnot significantly different from 2016.\u201d In 2017, 29.3 million (9.1 percent) people of all ages were uninsured at the time of the NHIS interview. (A NHIS report released in August, for the first three months of 2018, said 28.3 million people of all ages, or 8.8 percent, were uninsured at the time of interview.)\n\nOn top of that, five days after Obama spoke, the Census Bureau issued its own health insurance estimate, based on the Current Population survey. \u201cThe percentage of people without health insurance coverage for the entire calendar year was 8.8 percent, or 28.5 million people,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThe uninsured rate and number of uninsured in 2017 were not statistically different from 2016,\u201d when 400,000 more people had health insurance.\n\nAs Obama should know, all three surveys are well regarded. His White House in 2014 issued a news release touting the decline in the uninsured as shown in the NHIS, while also referencing the Gallup poll, the Census Bureau and other surveys. The differences in the results depend on factors such as when people were interviewed, how they were interviewed and so forth.\n\nObama\u2019s office referred us to a quote by Matthew Buettgens, a senior research analyst with the Urban Institute health policy center, to defend the use of the Gallup survey. So we checked with him to see whether he thought Gallup was a superior report.\n\n\u201cIt is correct that estimates from the National Health Interview Survey and the Current Population survey did not find significant increases in the number of uninsured in 2017, while Gallup did,\u201d Buettgens said. \u201cBoth of these surveys have a larger sample size than Gallup and both are used extensively by researchers. I do not consider Gallup to be better.\u201d\n\nThis shows the perils of cherry-picking data. Obama selected a number that put the impact of Trump\u2019s moves on Obamacare in the worst possible light, even though there was another well-respected survey that showed virtually no statistically significant decline in the number of people with insurance. Now the Census Bureau has backed up the NHIS conclusion that in Trump\u2019s first year, the impact was minimal.\n\nThe story may be different in 2018, given that Congress eliminated the individual mandate that required the purchase of health insurance or the payment of a fine. But Obama stated the decline as an established fact. He had a responsibility to note he was only citing one survey and that there was contradictory data. He earns Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
