I mean our democracy is so precious. We have to cherish it. We have to protect it, and yet when the Obama-Biden administration knew that there might be nefarious efforts to interfere or co-opt or in any way disturb our democracy, they didn\u2019t say anything to you. Now, as you sit here today, having watched these facts unfold, do you have any, any rationale as to why maybe the Clapper-Brennan-Comey-Obama-Biden team didn\u2019t want to give the Trump campaign a fair defensive briefing about the threats that we were facing?\u201d\n\nIn August of 2016 the FBI provided a counterintelligence defensive briefing to then-candidate Donald Trump and other senior campaign officials. This defensive briefing was conducted by an experienced FBI counterintelligence agent and focused on the broad range of threats posed by foreign intelligence entities. Similar briefings were also provided to then-candidate Hillary Clinton and the two Vice Presidential candidates prior to the November election. FBI counterintelligence personnel also provided defensive briefings for both campaigns\u2019 staff prior to the election. The FBI is not aware of any action(s) taken as a result of these briefings. While the FBI does not maintain a specific policy governing when such briefings are to be provided, as you highlighted in your letter, defensive briefings are an essential FBI counterintelligence tool. These briefings can be provided to any individual with access to information that could be valuable to foreign intelligence actors, to include Executive Branch officials, Members of Congress, or private citizens. By increasing these individuals\u2019 awareness of the indicators and warnings of foreign intelligence threats, they are often better postured to defend themselves and their organizations from foreign intelligence collection.\n\nIn a closed session with two House committees in December, James B. Comey, who was the FBI director in 2016, said, \u201cWith candidates, my recollection is we gave a general counterintelligence briefing about the threat coming from different nations.\u201d Comey, who was fired by Trump, also said, \u201cI have some recollection that they arranged for briefings of the candidates once they were nominated, and then part of that briefing would include a threat briefing from the FBI about the counterintelligence threat.\u201d At another point, Comey said, \u201cI know there were counterintelligence briefings given to both campaigns that covered the threat, I think, from the major adversaries of the United States.\u201d\n\nSciutto: Is it your view that Russia has the intention of if not influencing this election, undermining confidence in the U.S. political process? Clapper: Well, they are trying to look at things from their vantage I think and they are paranoid and Putin is personally about color revolutions and a potential for color revolution to occur in Russia and of course they see a U.S. conspiracy behind every bush and ascribe a far more impact than we are actually guilty of, but that\u2019s their mindset. And so I think that their approach is they believe that we are trying to influence political developments in Russia, we are trying to effect change and so their natural responses is to retaliate and do onto us as they think we\u2019ve done onto them and so I think that\u2019s again not surprising that they would behave that way. Sciutto: Now that, you know, I know \u2014 Clapper: And by the way if I could add, of course, the cyber realm opens up a whole range of possibilities for them.", "lang": "en"}
