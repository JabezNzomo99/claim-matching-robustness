The third image shows the body of a girl lying face-down.\n\nBOOM found that the image of the body of a minor girl is of Paswan's namesake, who reportedly died of suffocation due to electrocution when she had gone to pluck mangoes at an orchard in Bihar. We also contacted Paswan and found that the claims of her death were false.\n\nPaswan rode from Gurugram to her village Sirhulli in Darbhanga with her father as a pillion making it to headlines across the world during the lockdown in May. US president Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump had also applauded Paswan in a tweet.\n\nA Hindi caption with the post, when translated, reads 'The brave Jyoti Paswan, who cycled with her father as pillion rider for over 1500 kms to Bihar was raped. The government of good-governance is just a mute spectator. The incident hasn't taken place in a rich household. A poor man's daughter has died'.\n\nBOOM has chosen not to share the post owing to its disturbing nature.

We were told that the claims about Jyoti Kumari Paswan's death were false.\n\nBOOM then contacted Paswan and found that claims of her alleged rape and murder were baseless. \"I am fine and very much alive. Nothing has happened to me. The death of a girl by the same name has occurred far from where I stay. Her father's name is Ashok Paswan. Since we both share the same name, people thought it is me who has died,\" she told BOOM.\n\nAlso read: No, This Is Not A Photo Of Late Col.
