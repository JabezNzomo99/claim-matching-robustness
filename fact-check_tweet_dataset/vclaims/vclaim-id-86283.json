Moreover, people in today\u2019s polarized political climate seem increasingly willing to believe what they want to believe \u2014 especially when it aligns with their political values and is shown in video. This potent combination of advancements in technology, the spread of social media and an impressionable population allows video misinformation to spread rapidly.\n\nThe Fact Checker, working with Nadine Ajaka, Elyse Samuels and other video counterparts at The Washington Post, set out to develop and identify a universal language to label and identify online video and hold creators and sharers of misleading video accountable \u2014 a taxonomy, so to speak. These labels can then be applied to videos when they appear, so viewers can immediately know that they should watch the video with caution.\n\nWe developed three broad categories, which we envisioned as branches of a tree that can grow to include other categories as purveyors of false videos get ever more creative. Some video is taken out of context; other content is deceptively edited or, in the worst instances, deliberately altered. Each category features two types of misleading or false video.\n\nRegular readers might ask: Why not use the Pinocchio scale for videos? We saw a need for videos to have a separate verification system to complement Pinocchios. Video fact checks need the same quality and standards of text fact checks \u2014 but, more importantly, we need a way to classify these videos and determine the severity of manipulation. This is in line with how The Fact Checker has been contextualizing politicians\u2019 statements but is adapted to the video space.\n\nThe first category is Missing Context. The video is unaltered, but the way it is presented to the viewer lacks or misstates the context in which events occurred. This is an increasingly common occurrence in our political discourse.\n\nPresident Trump, for instance, shared on Twitter a video that allegedly showed people in Honduras getting cash from liberal billionaire George Soros or nongovernmental organizations to join a migrant caravan to the United States. That\u2019s an example of Mispresentation \u2014 presenting unaltered video in an inaccurate manner. The video was shot in Guatemala, and there is no evidence the money in the video came from U.S. organizations.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) shared on Twitter a clip of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings, claiming he uttered a \u201cdog whistle for going after birth control.\u201d This is an example of Isolation, sharing a brief clip from a longer video to create a false narrative that does not reflect the event as it occurred. The video snippet from his testimony did not make clear that Kavanaugh was quoting from the plaintiffs\u2019 position in an contraceptive case, rather than offering his own opinion.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) came under fire after the Sunrise Movement posted an edited video showing her speaking brusquely to schoolchildren about the Green New Deal. This is an example of Omission, editing out large portions from a video and presenting it as a complete narrative. The full video showed Feinstein more engaged with the children.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, in a campaign video called \u201cThe Road We\u2019ve Traveled,\u201d offered a misleading account of his mother\u2019s insurance battles while suffering from cancer. This is an example of Splicing, editing together disparate videos to fundamentally alter the story that is being told. The film arranged clips from interviews with the president and his wife to suggest she was denied health insurance because her cancer was a preexisting condition, when in reality she had a problem with disability insurance.\n\nIn November, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders shared a video that allegedly showed CNN reporter Jim Acosta act aggressively toward a White House intern. That is an example of Doctoring: altering the frames of a video \u2014 cropping, changing speed, using Photoshop, dubbing audio, or adding or deleting visual information \u2014 to deceive the viewer. This particular video included repeated frames that made Acosta\u2019s arm movement look more exaggerated.", "lang": "en"}
