He was charged with waging an information war against Ukraine and high treason.\n\nVyshinsky has dual Russian and Ukrainian citizenship. The SBU, Ukraine\u2019s national security service, posted a photograph of the Russia, \u201cFor Service to the Fatherland\u201d medal Vyshinsky received from Putin in 2014.\n\nThe Kremlin condemned Kyiv's actions and promised to protect the interests of Russian media.\n\nPutin said the high treason charges brought against Vyshinsky are \u201cunprecedented,\u201d claiming he has \u201cnot seen anything like this in a long time.\u201d\n\nBoth of Putin\u2019s claims are false.\n\nJournalists have faced high treason charges in many countries, and recent cases include Hilal Mammadov in Azerbaijan; three journalists in Somalia, where high treason is punishable by death; Carlos Julio Rojas in Venezuela; and Kamel Al-Tallou' in Libya.\n\nAnd there was Russia\u2019s own case \u2013 that of journalist Grigory Pasko.\n\nConvicted of high treason for reporting about the Russian naval fleet's dumping of radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan, Pasko spent a total of 20 months in prison between 1997 and 1999 prior to conviction. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment in 2001, and then detained again on related charges. Pasko was released from prison in 2003.\n\nSpeaking of Putin, Pasko told Polygraph.info in a comment from Moscow: \u201cWe met on November 19, 1999 at the Russian PEN-Club, where he was asked about my case. And, in answering the question, he demonstrated a profound knowledge of all the details of charging me, a journalist, with high treason.\u201d\n\nPasko added: \u201cBut Putin would not be Putin if he did not lie: the lie is exactly in his words about [it being] unprecedented. There was a precedent. And he apparently remembers it very well, because at the time, letters demanding my freedom were coming to him in piles.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the president of Reporters without Borders, Robert Menard, told Radio Free Europe: \u201cBy punishing Grigory Pasko, Vladimir Putin and his government revealed to the world their true face. They can't forgive Grigory Pasko's encroachment on three forbidden subjects, three taboos. These are the army, atomic [power] and the environment. Journalist Grigory Pasko had enough courage to go after all three topics and this is the price he is paying for his courage.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
