Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.\n\nInternet rumors casting doubt on her motivation have spread like wildfire.\n\nSome said she has a longstanding grudge against Kavanaugh for a foreclosure ruling. Others said she has monetary interests in protecting abortion rights. Most of it is baloney.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the most prominent claims about Ford on the internet, fact-checked.\n\nClaim: \"Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey exposed for ties to Big Pharma abortion pill maker\u2026 effort to derail Kavanaugh is plot to protect abortion industry profits.\"\n\nAbortion rights advocates worry that Kavanaugh would reverse Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion. Several websites suggested that Ford went after Kavanaugh because of a special interest in protecting abortion-inducing drugs. We rated that claim Pants on Fire.\n\nFord worked as director of biostatistics for Corcept Therapeutics, a California pharmaceutical startup, that sells Korlym, a drug that treats Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\n\nSaying they sold the abortion pill is like saying a road salt company sells food seasoning.\n\nThe main ingredient in Korlym can be used in combination with another drug to induce abortions. But it is not administered alone to induce abortions.\n\nCorcept requires that doctors rule out pregnancy in order to administer the drug.\n\nClaim: Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s mother presided over foreclosure case against Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s parents, which motivated the sexual assault accusation.\n\nSeveral blogs claimed that Ford went after Kavanaugh for a 22-year-old foreclosure ruling in which his mother was the judge and her parents were the defendants.\n\nWe found the case in question; Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s mother, Martha Kavanaugh, did preside over a foreclosure case in 1996 in which Ford\u2019s parents were defendants. However, according to the same documents, Martha Kavanaugh dismissed the case at the plaintiff\u2019s request.\n\nCBS News found the Blaseys settled with their mortgage lender, and the bank requested Martha Kavanaugh dismiss the case. She did. The Blaseys never appeared in her courtroom or lost their home, and Kavanaugh\u2019s mother had no effect on the outcome.\n\n\"Ford has a brother, Ralph Blasey, who worked for BakerHostetler, a law firm that retained Fusion GPS, the infamous DC company that produced the unverified Steele dossier on President Donald Trump and Russia, sparking the Russia investigation,\" a Liberty News press release reads.\n\nWe rated that Pants on Fire.\n\nRalph Blasey indeed worked at BakerHostetler. But he left nine years before the law firm hired Fusion GPS, a consulting firm, to assist with a Russian money-laundering investigation.\n\nIn 2015, Fusion GPS subcontracted with Christopher Steele, a British intelligence officer to produce the Russian dossier. Fusion GPS has said the two cases were unrelated.\n\nClaim: Ford also accused Justice Neil Gorsuch of sexual assault during his nomination process.\n\nTwitter user Josh Cornett tweeted: \"According to sources Diane [sic] Feinstein\u2019s reluctance to mention the Kavanaugh accuser\u2019s letter during confirmation session is because the accuser sent a similiar [sic] letter directed at Judge Gorsuch last year.\"\n\nThere is no evidence of any such accusation leveled against Gorsuch.\n\nCornett later tweeted he had \"no idea\" if that was true, but claimed \"my source has been very accurate in the past.\" The user has frequently tweeted messages that spread conspiracy theories like QAnon.\n\nSeveral blogs claimed Ford\u2019s university students had ravaged her in reviews, calling her \"mad\" and \"troubled\".\n\nThis was a case of mistaken identity. Bloggers had pulled reviews for the wrong Christine Ford; the reviews linked back to Christine Adams Ford, a professor of human services at California State University, Fullerton. Christine Blasey Ford teaches psychology and statistics at Palo Alto University.\n\nClaim: Says Christine Blasey Ford and her lawyer were photographed with George Soros, Hillary Clinton.\n\nA Facebook post attempts to discredit Ford by linking her to prominent Democrats. It purports to show Ford's lawyer with Clinton and Ford with Soros. Neither Ford nor her lawyer appear in either photo; they show Clinton's photographer, Barbara Kinney, and Lyudmyla Kozlovska, a Ukrainian human rights activist.\n\nWe rated this claim Pants on Fire.\n\nClaim: \"Kavanaugh accuser\u2019s husband breaks his silence, exposes \u2018sick issue\u2019 his wife has.\"\n\nThis headline on virginiapress31.site distorts comments made by Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s husband. We rated it False.\n\nThe story accurately quotes Russell Ford\u2019s comments to the Washington Post about his wife not getting the attention or respect she felt she deserved growing up.\n\nHowever, Russell Ford did not make those comments in efforts to expose a \"sick issue\" about his wife. That\u2019s a conclusion the website makes. Russell Ford\u2019s comments in the Washington Post story are in the context of how they met and built a relationship. Christine Blasey Ford grew up on the east coast and now lives in California, where she is a professor.\n\n\"She didn\u2019t always get along with her parents because of differing political views,\" Russell Ford told the Washington Post. \"It was a very male-dominated environment. Everyone was interested in what\u2019s going on with the men, and the women are sidelined, and she didn\u2019t get the attention or respect she felt she deserved. That\u2019s why she was in California, to get away from the D.C. scene.\"", "lang": "en"}
