Multiple users have shared it on Facebook, with one post garnering more than 1,000 shares.

Those like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have been living high on the hog at the expense of the American people for decades,\u201d the article credits supposed White House staffer Satya Martin with saying. \u201cThe people have spoken and they want the corruption to end. We are draining the swamp.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports of Trump planning to institute term limits on Congress via executive order. There\u2019s no record of such an executive order on his verified Twitter accounts or the White House website.\n\nThe White House staffer quoted in the article appears to be fictional, as Martin\u2019s name appears nowhere in the 2019 annual report of White House personnel to Congress. A quick internet search revealed the name has actually cropped up in several satire articles, making the article even more suspect.\n\nIn fact, the article originated on Daily World Update, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network of \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d While Daily Wold Update clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, Coffeerelax.co and other websites that picked up the story failed to do the same. They portray it as a real news story.\n\nTrump has previously spoken in favor of such a move. During his 2016 presidential campaign, he called for term limits for Congress as part of an ethics reform proposal, according to The Hill.", "lang": "en"}
