It may be a version of a statement written by American author H.L. Mencken.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet, better known by his pen name \u201cVoltaire,\u201d was one of the most influential figures of the Enlightenment, an intellectual movement that championed human reason. A poet, satirist and philosopher, Voltaire is perhaps best known for his 1759 novella \u201cCandide.\u201d\n\nThough Voltaire was a critic of organized religion, he did not author the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The statement appears nowhere in his collected works.\n\n\u201cThis quote is very widely attributed to Voltaire, and is certainly in his style, but in fact it is from H.L. Mencken, who has a certain similarity to Voltaire in his expression,\u201d City University of New York theatre historian Marvin Carlson, an expert on Voltaire\u2019s theatrical works, told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\nIndeed, the quote appears to be a version of a statement by Mencken, who wrote in his 1916 work \u201cA Book of Burlesques,\u201d \u201cCreator. A comedian whose audience is afraid to laugh.\u201d\n\nAn influential literary figure in his own right, Mencken was sometimes referred to as \u201cthe Voltaire of his time.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
