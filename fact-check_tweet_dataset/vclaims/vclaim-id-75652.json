Kumar said that the accused was mentally challenged.\n\nThe official Twitter account of Bhadohi police tweeted that Kotwali police had arrested a man named Premchandra Gautam.\n\nBut rabble rousing handle ShankhNaad, a serial offender when it comes to sharing fake and communally sensitive posts, said the statue was 'beheaded' allegedly by Muslims in Bhadohi.\n\nPost by other conservative Twitter users had sarcastic and derogatory references to the Muslim community.\n\nMany also accused the mainstream media of not reporting it.\n\nWe found articles on smaller websites such as jagran.com, rubarunews.com, patrika.com\n\nThe websites reported that shopkeepers who witnessed the statue being damaged confronted the mentally disturbed accused, but he ran away from the spot.\n\nThe news of the desecration of the statue spread like wildfire and agitated citizens gathered in large numbers blocking traffic.\n\nThey demanded the installation of a new statue and to register a case against the accused.\n\nLocal BJP leaders also gathered at the spot demanding action but the district deputy collector arrived at the spot with the police and brought the situation under control.", "lang": "en"}
