The archived version of the post can be accessed here.\n\nSearching the internet with keywords 'Prashant Bhushan attacked' will lead anyone to the numerous links reporting this incident from 2011.\n\nOn October 12, 2011, three people had entered Bhushan's chambers, opposite Supreme Court, while he was being interviewed by Times Now news channel.\n\nWhile one of the attackers was arrested, the other two had fled the spot. The arrested assailant later identified Tajinderpal Singh Bagga as another attacker. Bagga is the spokesperson of Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janta Party.\n\nBelow is the video from the attack perpetrated in 2011.\n\nThe arrested assailant had later said that the reason for the attack was Bhushan's statement on Jammu & Kashmir, reportedly supporting the demand of withdrawing security forces from the valley and conducting a referendum.\n\nThe attackers claimed to hold allegiance to Shri Ram Sene and Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena.\n\nHowever, the eight year old video has no connection with the recent Pulwama attacks, and is just a part of the several old clippings that have been revived and shared in the wake of the attacks.", "lang": "en"}
