No, he is not a terrorist Alt News did a Google reverse image search of the keyframes with help of Invid, a chrome extension and found a fact-check article published by The Quint on August 31, 2018. A 27-year-old former bodyguard was arrested by the on-duty CISF personnel in an intoxicated condition at Delhi\u2019s Indira Gandhi International Airport. A report published by Deccan Chronicle on August 18, 2018 stated, \u201cThe incident took place on the intervening night of August 16 and 17 when the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel manning the outermost checkpost of the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport flagged down a taxi on the basis of suspicion. The security personnel were taken aback as the passenger on the back seat kicked the driver out of the vehicle, took his position and tried to speed away, a senior police official said.\u201d He allegedly hit at least two CISF men and even made an attempt to snatch a pistol from a jawan, who subsequently fired two gunshots in the air in order to bring the situation under control. According to News18, the person was identified as Shankar, a resident of Sangam Vihar in Delhi. Another video of the same incident shared on social media Another video of the same incident is also being circulated on social media with similar claims. That the two videos represent the same incident was determined by observing similarities between them and correlating with the facts associated with the incident. This video also includes a man prostrated with security personnel trying to control him. Similar orange coloured traffic cones, which are often seen in airports, can be observed in the area around the suspect in both the videos. Moreover, an individual in the video can be heard stating, \u201cTwo shots were fired\u201c. A clipping of the below video was also posted on Twitter by Pioneer journalist Shekhar Singh claiming it to be representative of the same incident.\n\nSharing of sensational videos with false context is a tried-and-tested strategy for fake news purveyors. In this instance, a basic search would have revealed that the video has nothing to do with terrorism. Social media users are encouraged to make use of online tools for verification so that such misinformation can be countered in real-time.", "lang": "en"}
