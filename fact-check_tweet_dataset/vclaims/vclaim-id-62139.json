The Yangtze River, which passes through the dam, has flooded several times this year already due to heavy rains. Areas the downstream Yangtze is still recovering from heavy flooding that occurred in July and affected a large part of southeastern China.\n\nIn this context, a video is being widely shared on social media in which gushing water is sweeping away the city within minutes. This video is being shared with claim \"China's three gorges dam faces severe flooding as Yangtze overflows, Yangtze River Flood In Streets 3 Bridges Collapsed In this flood.\"\n\nNewsMeter received the viral video, questioning the location of the video.\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The above video was shot at the time of Tsunami in Japan, in 2011.\n\nAfter extracting the keyframes, we performed reverse image search in Google. We found that this video belongs to the Tsunami in Japan. The same video can be seen published on several YouTube channels with the time stamp.\n\nFrom then, this video is being circulated online on various platforms.\n\nOn March 11, 2011, an earthquake that measured 9 on the Richter scale shook northeastern Japan, unleashing a savage tsunami. The effects of the great earthquake were felt around the world, from Norway's fjords to Antarctica's ice sheet.\n\nThe claim that the Three Gorges bridge collapsed is also FALSE. According to several reports, the Yangtze river's fifth flood in China, has smoothly passed through the Three Gorges dam this year, taking the reservoir's water-level to a record high.\n\nThe floods caused an emergency evacuation of 2,51,000 people and inundated 23,700 shops, but did not lead to deaths, according to the municipality's emergency management bureau.\n\nHere is the video showing the situation of the floods in China.\n\nThe Atlantic website, on August 25, 2020, has published several pictures that show China floods.\n\nYangtze river's fifth flood passed through the Three Gorges dam, pushing the reservoir's water-level to a record high. Many buildings along the Yangtze River have been destroyed during the flood season but the Guanyin Pavilion in the middle of the river has continued to stand tall even after more than 700 years.\n\nThis claim is also debunked by Logical Indian.\n\nThough there has been flooding and damage during the recent China Yangtze river floods, the above video does not belong to China. It is a viral video shot during the Tsunami that occurred in Japan in 2011.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
