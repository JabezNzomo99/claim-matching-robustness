Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But some have still misrepresented the woman as \u201cAOC\u2019s crazy supporter.\u201d\n\nA bizarre moment at an Oct. 3 town hall event with Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was seemingly designed for virality.\n\nNearly an hour and a half into the event in Queens, New York, a woman stood up and proclaimed that, due to climate change, \u201cwe only have a few months left.\u201d Her proposed solution? \u201cWe got to start eating babies.\u201d\n\nThe exchange was instantly shared on social media and was shown the same night on Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d A reporter for the conservative website the Daily Wire shared the video on Twitter, characterizing the episode as \u201cone of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s constituents loses her mind over climate change.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., shared that tweet, writing: \u201cSeems like a normal AOC supporter to me.\u201d The president then responded to his son\u2019s tweet, calling Ocasio-Cortez a \u201cWack Job!\u201d\n\nBut it was quickly revealed to be a political stunt. The same night, a political action committee that supports Trump \u2014 and whose website refers to global warming as \u201cpopulation reduction, not science\u201d \u2014 publicly took credit.\n\n\u201cThanks, that was us,\u201d the Lyndon LaRouche Political Action Committee wrote in a tweet, adding: \u201cSatire is always the best.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso, a LaRouche PAC-endorsed U.S. Senate candidate in New Jersey, Daniel Burke, posted a statement from the organization to his campaign Facebook page on Oct. 4, saying a \u201cvolunteer for LaRouche PAC committed a prank against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after thinking about the actual implications of the Extinction Rebellion and the Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nIn the days since, though, some have continued to share the video, misrepresenting it as if a genuine moment. On Oct. 4, the comedian Terrence K. Williams \u2014 a Trump supporter who recently spoke at a White House event alongside the president \u2014 posted a video of himself reacting to footage from the town hall under the caption, \u201cAOC\u2019s CRAZY SUPPORTER.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the woman is heard saying: \u201cWe only have a few months left. I love that you support the Green Deal, but it\u2019s not getting rid of fossil fuel. It\u2019s not going to solve the problem fast enough \u2026 I think your next campaign slogan has to be this, \u2018We got to start eating babies.\u2019 We don\u2019t have enough time. There\u2019s too much CO2.\u201d\n\nShe also removed a jacket to reveal a T-shirt that read, \u201cSave the Planet, Eat the Children.\u201d\n\nIn his video, Williams tells his viewers at one point: \u201cAOC, this is what you are creating right here. AOC, this is all you.\u201d\n\nAt no point does Williams acknowledge that the outburst was staged and that the woman was not a \u201csupporter\u201d of Ocasio-Cortez. Many who commented on his video said they were appalled by the woman\u2019s remarks, and suggested she was representative of Ocasio-Cortez supporters. (One user wrote, \u201cLook I don\u2019t follow politics to [sic] much. Thanks for the posting. But seriously AOC is a lunatic and obviously her supporters are as well.\u201d)\n\nThe video \u2014 which continues to attract viewers \u2014 has received more than 457,000 views and has been shared over 18,000 times. In an Oct. 7 Facebook post about the same reaction video, Williams reposted his video, urged \u201cTWITTER LEGAL TEAM\u201d to leave him alone, and wrote that he had \u201ccriticized AOC\u2019s response to her looney supporter saying we should eat babies to stop climate change.\u201d\n\nAnother Facebook page also posted a clip of the woman\u2019s outburst on Oct. 3 with the caption: \u201cThis is REAL. These people are out there. One of AOC\u2019s constituents, absolutely CRAZED over climate change hysteria, advocated for eating babies at tonight\u2019s town hall meeting.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez has prioritized the issue of climate change during her months in Congress. One of her early proposals was a nonbinding resolution outlining goals for a \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d We should note that Ocasio-Cortez has not suggested that \u201cwe only have a few months left\u201d due to climate change, as the woman at the event declared.\n\nOcasio-Cortez didn\u2019t directly respond to the woman\u2019s comments about eating babies. Instead, she said: \u201cWe need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present; luckily we have more than a few months. We do need to hit net-zero [greenhouse gas emissions] in several years. But I think we all need to understand that there are a lot of solutions that we have and that we can pursue and that if we act in a positive way, there is space for hope.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet after the town hall, the congresswoman said, \u201cAt one point I was concerned there was a woman in crisis & want to ensure we treat the situation compassionately.\u201d She also said, \u201cThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it\u2019s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged that the episode was orchestrated, referring to the woman as a \u201cTrump supporter.\u201d We don\u2019t know the woman\u2019s identity, but as we said, the group that took credit for the staged incident supports Trump and has called the performance an act of satire.\n\nSome on Twitter also pointed out that the woman can be seen in a video about stopping the \u201cfascist green movement\u201d that the LaRouche PAC posted in September.\n\nWe reached out to the LaRouche PAC to ask for more information on the stunt and the woman at the center of it, but we did not receive a response.\n\nThe political action committee\u2019s namesake is Lyndon LaRouche, an eight-time presidential candidate who died earlier this year. LaRouche had once referred to global warming as a \u201cscientific fraud.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Satire is always the best.\u201d Twitter. 3 Oct 2019.", "lang": "en"}
