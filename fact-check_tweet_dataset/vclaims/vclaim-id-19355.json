Yet, while Einstein is highly quotable, there\u2019s no evidence that the man who developed the theory of relativity ever said the quote in question. (RELATED: Did Albert Einstein Coin This Saying On The \u2018Definition Of Insanity\u2019?)\n\nIt does not appear in \u201cThe Ultimate Quotable Einstein,\u201d which features more than 1,000 verified Einstein quotes. A search of the archives of Einstein\u2019s writings online didn\u2019t return any results either.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation also reached out to several experts, none of whom recognized the saying. Two experts \u2014 New York University professor Matthew Stanley and University of Florida physicist Clifford M. Will \u2014 didn\u2019t even think it sounded like Einstein.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is genuine,\u201d Stanley told TheDCNF in an email. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine him saying, \u2018conduit for passing energy.'\u201d\n\nAccording to Quote Investigator, the quote may actually come from a 1990 book by Christina Baldwin, though the wording varies somewhat. In \u201cLife\u2019s Companion: Journal Writing as a Spiritual Quest,\u201d the quote reads, \u201cSpiritual love is a position of standing with one hand extended into the universe and one hand extended into the world, letting ourselves be a conduit for passing energy.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
