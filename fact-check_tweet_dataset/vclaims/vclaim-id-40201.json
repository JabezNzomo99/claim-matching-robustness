Col. Alexander Vindman's testimony in the impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Nov. 21, 2019, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) had removed Fox News from \u201cArmed Forces Radio\u201d over the network\u2019s coverage of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman\u2019s testimony during the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump:\n\nNo, Fox News has not been removed from \u201cArmed Forces Radio,\u201d a misnomer of the American Forces Network Radio (AFN).\n\nNavy Capt. Bill Speaks, a Pentagon spokesperson, confirmed to the Associated Press that this rumor was false:\n\nA spokesperson for American Forces Network Radio told us via email:\n\nWhile Fox News was not removed from America Forces Network Radio, the network truly was criticized for how it covered Vindman\u2019s testimony. Vindman\u2019s lawyer sent a letter to Fox News asking it to retract an Oct. 28 segment that aired on Laura Ingraham\u2019s prime-time show, \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d On the show, guest John Yoo, a former deputy assistant U.S. attorney general, appeared to suggest that Vindman was guilty of espionage.\n\nA law firm representing Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman sent Fox News a warning letter on Wednesday asking for the retraction and correction of a segment on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show which suggested the colonel might be guilty of espionage. \u201cWe are compelled to write because of a deeply flawed and erroneous Fox News segment that first aired on October 28, 2019, the gist of which has since been republished countless times, including by the President of the United States to his 66.9 million Twitter followers.\u201d The segment on The Ingraham Angle featured a panel with lawyer John Yoo, a former Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General and current U.C. Berkeley law professor, and legal scholar, Alan Dershowitz. In an exchange with Yoo, Ingraham remarked on something she read about about the colonel, the New York Times reports. \u201cHere we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest, and usually, they spoke in English,\u201d said Ingraham. \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d \u201cI find that astounding and, you know, some people might call that espionage,\u201d responded Yoo.\n\nFox News released a statement saying that \u201cYoo was responsible for his own sentiments\u201d:\n\nYoo also wrote an op-ed for USA Today on Nov. 1, 2019, in which he claimed that he was talking about Ukraine, not Vindman specifically, and that he has \u201cno reason to question Vindman\u2019s patriotism or loyalty to the United States.\u201d\n\nVindman\u2019s lawyers also addressed Yoo\u2019s Op-Ed in their complaint, writing:\n\n\u201cOn November 1, 2019, Mr. Yoo published an op-ed in USA Today regarding his appearance on Fox News several days earlier. In the Yoo op-ed, Mr. Yoo stated, contrary to fact, that \u201cI didn\u2019t call Alexander Vindman a spy.\u201d But of course, he did \u2013 Mr. Yoo\u2019s statement on Fox News expressly accused LTC Vindman of \u201cespionage\u201d and was universally understood to have done so. it is why Mr. Yoo wrote an op-ed seeking to rewrite recorded fact; it is why he begins his op-ed, \u201cI really stepped in it this week.\u201d What Mr. Yoo \u201cstepped in\u201d was a lie.", "lang": "en"}
