Examples can be seen here and here .\n\nSome of the posts and comments refer to \u201cPizzagate\u201d, which stemmed from a fake online report that a Washington DC pizza restaurant was cover for a child sex trafficking ring ( here ). In 2017, a man named Edgar Welch went into the Comet Ping Pong restaurant with an assault rifle loaded with 29 rounds of ammunition, pointed it at an employee and fired shots into a door. He was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nWelch told authorities he had been trying to investigate the online conspiracy theory that the eatery was a front for a pedophile ring led by then Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ( here ).\n\nThe Oswalt tweet has been edited in order to fabricate the caption and location. The original tweet can be seen here . It reads, \u201cSelfie at the #TeenTitansGoMovie premiere! Boo-yah!\u201d and the location is tagged as TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe tweet appears to show Oswalt\u2019s daughter and wife, who appear elsewhere in his Twitter feed ( here , here ).\n\nA June 27 New York Times report here describes how the baseless \u201cPizzagate\u201d theory has morphed away from Hillary Clinton to target a range of other celebrities.\n\nFalse. The text and location of this tweet have been falsified. The original tweet shows Oswalt and his family at a California movie theater, not a Washington pizza restaurant.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
