The video depicts the police lathi-charging a group of madrasa teachers protesting at Gardnibagh stadium in Patna with the demands for the improvement of the condition of close to 2,500 madrasas across Bihar. According to a TOI report, these were supporters of the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat (AIMMM) and madrasa teachers at the stadium who had allegedly tried to go to CM\u2019s house when they were stopped by the police.\n\nIndia TV also had reported the incident at the time.\n\nIn conclusion, a three-year-old video of protesting madrasa teachers from Patna, Bihar was shared as Kashmiris being beaten-up by the police after the recent developments in J&K. Earlier this week, a video of Indo-US joint military exercise was falsely shared as \u2018Live Encounter\u2018 in Kashmir.", "lang": "en"}
