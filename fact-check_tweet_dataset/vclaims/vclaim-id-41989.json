His remark drew criticism from the BJP, with union textile minister Smriti Irani addressing it in the Parliament. She claimed, \u201cThis is first time in history that a leader is giving a clarion call that Indian women should be raped. Is this Rahul Gandhi\u2019s message to the people of the country?\u201d\n\nHer full speech can be watched below.\n\nThe speech verbatim reads, \u201cA party\u2019s politician gives a public clarion call that India\u2019s women should be raped. This is the first time in history that Congress party\u2019s politician has included crime as serious as rape as a part of political mockery. This is the first time in history that a son of the Gandhi family has publicly called that women in India should be raped. I want to ask the hon\u2019 speaker, Rahul Gandhi is a politician of this parliament, he is a lawmaker of his parliament. Is it his statement that all men in India want to rape women? Is it his statement to citizens of this country that he makes a public call that the nation\u2019s women be raped? Hon\u2019 speaker, this is not about the dignity of just the men and women of this Parliament but a member of this Parliament is demanding for the first time that India\u2019s women be raped. These words were uttered out of his mouth. Ask any woman of this country, if there is a public call for her rape, she knows how to give a fitting reply.\u201d\n\nIrani\u2019s speech was met with BJP members demanding an apology from Rahul Gandhi. Subsequently, the union minister goes on to say, \u201cI want your protection, hon\u2019 speaker for the women of this country. A lawmaker from the Gandhi family has made a public call for women to be raped. Will you punish him? I appeal to you on behalf of this country\u2019s families. Every man, brother, father is not a rapist. The ones who are, are strictly punished by law. But to publically call for the rape of all women, hon\u2019 speaker, this should be punished.\u201d\n\nThe minister of textiles ends her speech by saying, \u201cA public call \u2018come rape in India\u2019. This is the most heinous statement given by a political leader. He should be punished.\u201d\n\nHowever, the union minister\u2019s claim that Gandhi made a public clarion call that all women in India should be raped is false.\n\nWHAT DID RAHUL GANDHI ACTUALLY SAY?\n\nAddressing a public rally in Godda, the Congress leader took a swipe at the Modi government for widespread crimes against women and said, \u201cNarendra Modi had said \u2018Make in India\u2019 but nowadays wherever you look, it is \u2018Rape in India. Open a newspaper, a woman is raped in Jharkhand. See in Uttar Pradesh, Narendra Modi\u2019s MLA raped a woman and the car met with an accident but Narendra Modi didn\u2019t say a word. In every state, every day, rape in India. Narendra Modi says \u2018Beti Padho Beti Bacho\u2019. But Modiji you did not say save from whom? Save her from BJP\u2019s MLA.\u201d\n\nCongress MP Rahul Gandhi did not give a clarion call that Indian women should be raped, as claimed by union minister Smriti Irani. His \u2018Make in India \u2013 Rape in India\u2019 remark was an attempt to take a swipe at the Modi government for the multiple incidents of rape reported across the country.\n\nGandhi has refused to apologise for his statement while reiterating its meaning. \u201cI won\u2019t apologise\u2026 Let me clarify what I said. I said the PM keeps talking about \u2018Make In India\u2019. So when one opens the newspaper one hoped that one would see news about it, but what do we see when we open the papers? We see so many cases of rapes,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nThe Congress leader also tweeted a video of where PM Modi can be heard terming Delhi the \u201crape capital\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
