(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis years-old warning is exaggerated. Don\u2019t be scared to use pre-chopped onions \u2013 they are perfectly safe to consume as long as you handle the food properly.\n\nThe myth is rooted in the possibility that bacteria can grow on vegetables between the time they are chopped and cooked. But with proper handling and storage, it is unlikely to become \"dangerous\" overnight or over several nights.\n\nIn an archived blog post, Joe Schwarcz, director of the McGill Office for Science and Society at McGill University in Canada, writes that onions are not especially prone to bacterial contamination. In fact, he says, it is quite the opposite.\n\n\"Cutting an onion triggers the release of enzymes that initiate a chemical reaction producing propenesulfenic acid, which in turn decomposes to yield sulphuric acid. It is the sulphuric acid that makes you cry by irritating the eyes! But sulphuric acid also inhibits the growth of bacteria,\" Schwarcz says in the post.\n\nHe goes on to explain that because a cut onion\u2019s surface dries out quickly, it reduces the moisture needed for bacteria to multiply. And to have bacteria multiply, there needs to be a source of bacteria on the onion in the first place.\n\nSo unless you have sliced your onions on a contaminated cutting board, or handled them with dirty hands, you can safely put them in a plastic bag and store them and there will not be any bacterial contamination,\" he says. \"There is no reason to suggest that onions are in any way more risky than other foods and avoiding onions is not only unnecessary but unhealthy. That\u2019s because onions contain a variety of compounds that have health benefits.\n\nAccording to the National Onion Association, chopped or sliced onions can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for seven to 10 days.\n\nAn old myth circulating online warns consumers that pre-chopping an onion to cook the following day is dangerous because it \"becomes highly poisonous\" and \"creates toxic bacteria.\"\n\nAny vegetable can become contaminated with bacteria if it isn\u2019t handled or stored properly. Onions do not attract bacteria more than other vegetables and actually inhibit pathogen growth.", "lang": "en"}
