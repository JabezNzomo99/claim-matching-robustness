The national election is scheduled for 8 May 2019.\n\n\n\nThe party claims that \"landlessness and joblessness among black South Africans are at crisis levels, posing the biggest challenges that confront South African society today\".\n\n\n\nThis report fact-checks five claims about land occupation, school dropout rates, unemployment, land redistribution and gender balance.\n\n\n\n\n\non ownership data and the size of the African and coloured population.\n\nThe party\u2019s national communications manager, Sixolise Gcilishe, explained how it was calculated:\n\nThis fact-check evaluates each of the EFF\u2019s assumptions stated above.\n\nIn 1993, the year before South Africa\u2019s first democratic election, a Stats SA agricultural census estimated the country had about\n\nto this land as \u201cwhite-owned agricultural land\u201d.\n\nThis was 67% of South Africa\u2019s total land.\n\nThe EFF said work by Plaas, the\n\nat the University of the Western Cape, was the source of the 67% used in its calculation.\n\nThe number is contained in\n\non land distribution co-authored by Prof Cherryl Walker, a professor of sociology at the University of Stellenbosch. She said the 67% was commercial farmland historically reserved for white ownership, but it shouldn't be assumed to be the share in white hands today.\n\nSince 1994 black people have acquired some of this land through private sales and loans.\n\nProf Ben Cousins of Plaas described the EFF estimates as \u201chighly misleading\u201d. He said much of the land acquired for land reform since 1994 was \u201cno doubt farmland, and no longer forms part of the 67% of the total land area formerly in the hands of white farmers\u201d.\n\ncommissioned by parliament says \u201csome land acquired or transferred may not be commercial agricultural land\u2026 Nonetheless, we may presume that most may be considered land zoned for agriculture outside of the former Bantustans\u201d.\n\nHow much agricultural land is owned by white people? The available data is limited.\n\nAccording to the\n\n, farms and other agricultural land amounted to just over 111 million hectares in 2015. The audit only provides a racial breakdown for agricultural land owned by individuals,\n\n. It estimates that white people own 72% of this land \u2013 26.7 million hectares.\n\nthat white farmers owned 68.5 million hectares of agricultural land in 2016. This includes land owned by companies and trusts and amounts to 56% of total land.\n\nAgricultural economist Wandile Sihlobo gave Africa Check an estimate of agricultural land not owned by white people.\n\nIt identifies 17.5 million hectares of farmland as \u201cnot owned by whites\u201d. The calculation was done with the help of agricultural economist Prof Johann Kirsten of the University of Stellenbosch and based on data from 2015 and 2017.\n\nIt is made up of agricultural land owned by the state, redistributed and restored land and a \u201cguesstimate\u201d of the land bought by willing\n\nfrom willing white sellers. It also includes a hectare equivalent of money paid in land restitution claims.\n\n, which relies on 2018 data from the department of rural development and land reform.\n\nNote: This calculation does not include a hectare equivalent of compensation paid for restoration.)\n\nUsing these redistribution numbers, and an estimated 643,995 hectares of agricultural land acquired by the state for development purposes, it estimates that 64.8 million hectares of farmland (53% of total land) is owned by white people.\n\nThe available data therefore does not support the EFF\u2019s assumption that 82 million hectares of agricultural land \u2013 67% of South Africa\u2019s land \u2013 is in white hands.\n\nThe 2017 state land audit focused on privately owned land. The previous audit, published in 2013, identified\n\nof the total land as state-owned land.\n\nsaid \u201cstate land\u201d could be a misleading category. \u201cIt includes land held for nature conservation, state forests, water and defence force use. It also includes [land] in the traditional areas.\n\nland under traditional tenure to be 18.4 million hectares \u2013 or 15% of total land.\n\nEconomist Johann Bornman, given as a source for calculations of land size in the working paper, said that in 2018 the rural development and land reform department updated its estimate of land in the former homelands to this number.\n\n, said the EFF \u201cseems to ignore the fact that black South African have underlying rights to all the land in the former homelands, which is state land\u201d.\n\nHow much land do Indian South Africans own?\n\nthat 77% of land (94 million hectares) was privately owned.\n\nBut only the race of individual owners of\n\ncould be determined. And these numbers may not be spot-on.\n\nThe deeds registry does not record the race of land owners. In cases where the race could not be derived from Stats SA data, names and surnames were used. \u201cThe indirect extraction of race data\u2026 exposed the land audit to the risk of under- or over-reporting,\u201d the audit report says.\n\nis owned by Indians. But this is not supported by the land audit, which puts individual Indian ownership at 2.1 million hectares, including sectional title property.\n\nAfrica Check it did not include sectional title units when calculating land owned by individuals \u201cas they include units in high-rise buildings such as flats, office buildings\u2026 which may distort the numbers\u201d.\n\nNote: Percentages don\u2019t add up to 100% because the categories \u201cco-ownership\u201d and \u201cother\u201d are left out.)\n\nIndian people may own land through trusts, companies and community organisations but there is no data on this.\n\nThe same goes for African and coloured people, who own 6.9 million hectares of individually owned land or close to 6% of the total land. Coloured and African people together make up close to 90% of the population,\n\nThe 2017 land audit only gives data on the race of the owners of about a third of the land. A breakdown by race for other types of private ownership is not available.\n\nIt is also silent on who occupies this land \u2013 in some cases, owners do not occupy their land \u2013 as well as on who occupies land in the former homelands.\n\nThe EFF\u2019s calculation also does not take into account erven and sectional title units owned by white people.\n\nThe EFF\u2019s calculation makes assumptions about ownership to support a claim about the occupation of land. It incorrectly assumes white people own 82 million hectares of agricultural land and overestimates land individually owned by Indians. It is therefore incorrect.\n\nThe EFF\u2019s claim applies to a worldwide comparison, the party\u2019s national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe confirmed. She referred us to\n\nThe common thread in these documents is work done by Professor Martin Gustafsson, an education economist and member of the\n\ngroup at the University of Stellenbosch. However, Gustafsson does not agree that his work supports the EFF\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cIn fact, as far as secondary [school] completion is concerned \u2013 that\u2019s essentially what this is about \u2013 we\u2019re fairly normal for a middle-income country,\u201d he said.\n\nGustafsson said it was \u201cwidely accepted\u201d that the dropout rate was difficult to calculate, \u201cespecially in developing countries, where data systems are limited\u201d.\n\nHowever, he said, education planners regarded\n\nof the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) as useful: \u201cThe proportion of pupils from a cohort enrolled in a given grade at a given school year who are no longer enrolled in the next school year.\u201d\n\nGustafsson noted that the Unesco definition related to individual grades. \u201cSo one can talk about a dropout rate for Grade 10, another one for Grade 11 and so on.\u201d\n\nOne of the alternative methods to calculate the dropout rate is to use data from household surveys to determine what proportion of the population has obtained a matric certificate.\n\nGustafsson said this method was not ideal, but was an \u201cadequate stopgap\u201d. It was the method used by the department of basic education in response to a parliamentary question about dropout rates in June last year.\n\ncontains an estimated dropout rate for those born between 1990 and 1992.\n\nInformation from Statistics South Africa\u2019s (Stats SA) General Household Survey for 2014 to 2016 was used to estimate that 51.5% of these people had completed Grade 12.\n\nWe asked the department of basic education to provide more recent calculations if they were available, but it failed to respond to our query.\n\nOne of the documents the EFF referred to in support of its claim is a\n\nauthored by Gustafsson, but it did not include a worldwide comparison.\n\nThe working paper looked at Grade 12 completion rates in 14 countries, including Turkey, Brazil and Chile, based on data from 2003 to 2009. South Africa was ranked 12th.\n\nGustafsson referred Africa Check to Unesco\u2019s upper secondary school completion rates as a source of more recent data that would allow for a global comparison.\n\nBased on these figures, the department\u2019s\n\nconcluded that \u201cthe upper secondary education completion [Grade 12] rate for South Africa has been equal to that of middle-income countries in general in recent years\u201d.\n\nWe compared the average upper secondary education completion rates of\n\n\u2013 for the five years from 2014 to last year \u2013 and found that 38 countries had lower completion rates than South Africa.\n\nGustafsson said while South Africa\u2019s secondary completion rate was \u201cfairly normal for a middle-income country\u201d, we should aim to increase it, as many other countries are doing.\n\nHe warned that \u201cdefining our vast educational inequalities only in terms of school completion would be incorrect. Many of our inequalities relate to the quality of education, not the years of schooling completed by young people.\u201d\n\nThe EFF\u2019s claim that South Africa\u2019s school dropout rate is among the worst in the world is incorrect. Unesco data for 2014 to last year show that South Africa was in the top 50% of 68 countries based on secondary school completion.\n\nmeasures unemployment in two ways \u2013 according to the narrower, official definition and according to the expanded definition.\n\nThe agency\u2019s acting chief director for labour statistics, Malerato Mosiane, explained: \u201cThe difference between the official and expanded definition of unemployment is that the job search criterion is relaxed in the expanded definition.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the official definition, someone has to be without work, available for work and searching for work or trying to start a business. The expanded definition does not require a person to be looking for a job \u2013 they just need to be without work and available for work.\n\nAt the time the EFF released its manifesto on February 2, the latest available Quarterly Labour Force Survey was for the\n\nAccording to the report and based on the\n\nwere unemployed at that time.\n\nThis means that they:\n\u2022 None Were between the ages of 15 and 64;\n\u2022 None Were not employed in the week before the survey interview; and\n\u2022 None Actively looked for work or tried to start a business in the four weeks before the interview, and would have been able to start work or a business in the week before the interview. \n\n\n\nA person was also considered unemployed if they \u201chad not actively looked for work in the past four weeks, but had a job or business to start at a definite date in the future and were available\u201d.\n\n. This group of people wanted to work, but did not try to find work because of a lack of jobs in their area, because they had lost hope or could not find work requiring their skills.\n\nAn additional 817,000 people without work provided reasons for failing to search for a job other than the ones contained in the definition of a discouraged work seeker. These included ill health, a disability, pregnancy, childcare duties and a lack of transport, said Mosiane.\n\nCapability not part of either definition\n\nThe unemployed, discouraged work seekers and those with other reasons for not searching for a job make up the expanded definition of unemployment. According to this definition, close to 9.8 million people, or\n\n) were unemployed in the third quarter of last year.\n\nWhile Mosiane noted that the EFF\u2019s claim used the term \u201ccapable\u201d, which was not part of the official or the expanded definition of unemployment, the numbers in the claim most closely match the expanded definition.\n\nthat there is little to distinguish between the two definitions in South Africa. Stats SA\n\nAfrica Check that the expanded definition is a more stable indicator.\n\nEFF national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe confirmed to Africa Check that the party had applied the expanded definition in this case.\n\nIn 2012, then rural development and land reform minister Gugile Nkwinti used his\n\nNkwinti said the target applied to white-owned agricultural land \u2013 close to a third of which government wanted to distribute to the historically disadvantaged by 2014.\n\nWhen the target was set in 1994, white-owned agricultural land was estimated to be\n\nThe 30% came to 24.6 million hectares, which were earmarked for all three components of land reform, namely restitution, redistribution and tenure reform, according to the department of rural development and land reform.\n\nThe department pointed out that it would be incorrect to still use the 30% target as it applied until 2014. The current target is to redistribute\n\n, in line with the\n\nWe were unable to confirm with the department by the time of publication whether land previously redistributed would count towards the new target.\n\nHow much land has the state bought?\n\nEFF national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe told us the party based its claim on a\n\ncommissioned by a high-level panel on the assessment of key legislation and the acceleration of fundamental change.\n\nThe panel, chaired by former president Kgalema Motlanthe, was tasked with assessing the effectiveness of legislation that has come into effect since 1994. Land reform was one of the focus areas of the panel\u2019s work.\n\nAccording to the report, authored by the\n\nat the University of the Western Cape,\n\nwere redistributed between 1994 and 2014/15. A further 3.2 million hectares were restored through restitution by 2014/15.\n\nThis comes to 8.2 million hectares, or 6.7%, of the total land in South Africa (\n\n). The EFF told us this was how it reached the figure of \u201cless than 7%\u201d.\n\n, according to the department, largely correspond with the data in the Plaas report. They show that the state has bought 4.9 million hectares for land redistribution since 1994, and a further 3.3 million hectares for restitution. Land acquired for tenure reform (782,487 hectares) was included in the 4.9 million hectares, said the department.\n\nIt would therefore be correct to say that government has bought less than 7% of the total land in South Africa, but it is incorrect to say that the state has only bought 7% of the targeted 30%. The state has bought 8.2 million hectares \u2013 or 33% \u2013 of the targeted 24.6 million hectares.\n\nNot all of the land bought or transferred to beneficiaries for the purpose of land redistribution is necessarily commercial agricultural land. According to another commissioned high-level panel report, \u201csome land acquired may be in urban areas or in communal areas, and may have been land acquired for non-agricultural purposes \u2013 before land reform became equated with agriculture. Nevertheless, we may presume that most may be considered land zoned for agriculture outside of the former Bantustans.\u201d\n\nThe EFF\u2019s claim only mentions land acquired for redistribution, but land was also bought for restitution and tenure reform.\n\nthe difference: \u201cSoon after the first election in 1994, an ambitious policy of land reform began to be implemented. This included a land redistribution programme aimed at broadening access to land among the country\u2019s black majority; a land restitution programme to restore land or provide alternative compensation to those dispossessed as a result of racially discriminatory laws and practices since 1913; and a tenure reform programme to secure the rights of people living under insecure arrangements on land owned by others, including the state (in communal areas and the former \u2018coloured\u2019 rural reserves) and private landowners (farm workers, farm dwellers and labour tenants).\u201d\n\nThe department confirmed that the amount of land bought for restitution excluded cases in which compensation was paid because land could not be restored or because beneficiaries chose to be compensated instead.\n\nThe claim that the government has bought less than 7% of the land initially meant for redistribution since 1994 is incorrect. Data show that it has bought a third \u2013 or 8.2 million hectares \u2013 of the land.\n\nWomen and girls make up 51% of the country\u2019s population, according to Statistics South Africa\u2019s\n\n. But the people most political parties choose to represent them in the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces don\u2019t reflect this.\n\n, the EFF claims to have a \u201chigher gender balance\u201d in parliament.\n\nWe asked the party if this means it has a higher share of women among its representatives in parliament than other parties.\n\ndidn\u2019t respond to the question but did send us a spreadsheet. According to this, 40% \u2013 or 10 \u2013 of the EFF\u2019s National Assembly members and 67% (4) of its National Council of Provinces members were female.\n\nwith two houses: the National Assembly (NA) and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP).\n\nWe used the most recent list of NA members, provided by parliament, and a list of changes in membership to work out the gender breakdown at the time the EFF released its election manifesto.\n\nThe African National Congress (ANC) had a higher share of female NA representatives, at 50%, while 44% of the EFF\u2019s NA members were female.\n\nWe compared the list provided by parliament to information on the\n\nand parliament\u2019s own website. We found one female ANC member who had been excluded from the list of female members.\n\nThe EFF had the highest share of women (67%) in the NCOP when the party released its manifesto, based on a list of current members and resignations provided by NCOP chairperson Thandi Modise\u2019s office.\n\nTotal for both houses of parliament\n\nBut how do the numbers add up for both houses of parliament?\n\nFor the EFF, 48% of all its members of parliament were female when the party released its manifesto. The ANC had a higher share: 49% of its members were female.\n\nThe EFF claimed it had \u201ca higher gender balance\u201d in parliament. The data shows it had a higher share of female representatives in parliament than 11 other parties at the time it released its election manifesto. Forty-eight percent of the EFF\u2019s members of parliament were women, compared with 49% of the ANC\u2019s members.\n\nThe EFF published its election manifesto on 2 February 2019.", "lang": "en"}
