(Narendra Modi is the only Indian in the list of 50 honest leaders released in the US; that too in number one position.)\"\n\nAt the time of filing this story, the post was shared more than 9,000 times. The page has a following of more than 26 lakh people.\n\nFacebook users 'Dipak Prajapati' and 'Vasudev Singh Roopnagar' are among those who have shared the post.\n\nTo find out the fact behind the viral claim, we start searching the internet for such a list. We found that American business magazine 'Forbes' had ranked PM Modi at number 9 in the list of \"Most powerful people\" in 2018.\n\nPM Modi also got placed at number 5 in the list of \"World's greatest leaders -2015\" by American multinational business magazine 'Fortune'.\n\nEuropean Association of polling organisations, 'The Gallup International Association' ranked Modi at number four in its annual survey - \"Opinion of Global Leaders\" of the year 2018. However, we didn't find any list that can substantiate the viral claim naming \"the most honest leaders in the world\".\n\nIn December 2015, former US President Barack Obama was all praise for Modi and called him an \"honest and direct\" politician having a clear vision for India. However, this was not part of any survey of honest politicians or leaders in the world. Many prominent media houses had published the statement from the White House.\n\nThe viral claim was also available on social media last year with the name of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in it. Fact checker Alt News had debunked the claim.", "lang": "en"}
