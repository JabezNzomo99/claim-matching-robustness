An excerpt from the description of the video reads, \"... I wanted to continue the party by sharing this fireworks display I created & actualized. It took me a little over a week to complete, and I am very happy with the outcome. All of the shells are custom-made by me, and I take huge pride in the handiwork that went into bringing them to life. I hope you all enjoy the show. :) The music choice used for this display is Thomas Bergersen's (Two Steps From Hell) \"Heart of Courage.\" Truly a great musical arrangement. The great software used to mastermind a production like this is FWSim.\"\n\nWe then looked up FWSim (stated in the description) on the internet and were directed to a website http://www.fwsim.com/shows.html which is a firework simulator website.\n\nSubscribers can create their own fireworks through the software.", "lang": "en"}
