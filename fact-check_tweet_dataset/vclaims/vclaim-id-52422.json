The Maryland State Fire Marshal debunked the claim on Twitter.\n\nStates have been gradually reopening their economies, allowing non-essential business to open to the public under certain guidelines and allowing gatherings of people, the New York Times reported.

It bears the signature of Democratic Gov. Larry Hogan and Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford.\n\n\u201cSocial Distancing must be practiced as always, for safety purposes,\u201d the alleged guidelines further state. \u201cHugging, kissing or touching of any kind will not be permitted. Failure to comply may result in multiple fines up to $1,200 to be assessed per occurrence.\u201d\n\nNo official guidelines detailing such restrictions could be found on the Maryland government website. In fact, the website Visit Maryland, which operates under the Maryland\u2019s tourism office, has compiled a list of various Independence Day celebrations being held throughout the state. Many of these celebrations include fireworks and being outside, two of the things restricted in the alleged guidelines.\n\nThe Maryland State Fire Marshal also debunked the claim on Twitter.\n\n\u201cSTATE FIRE MARSHAL WARNS OF FICTITOUS ONLINE FIREWORKS POSTER \u2013 The OSFM is asking citizens to be aware of a fake online information about Independence Day celebrations,\u201d reads the tweet.\n\nThe tweet links to an official statement from the Fire Marshal\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThis poster is simply fake and was produced without the authority of the Governor\u2019s Office or the Office of the State Fire Marshal,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cWe would not direct citizens on a specific time to be outside and recommend the latest CDC guidelines on how to properly socially distance.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
