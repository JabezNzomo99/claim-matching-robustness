They were about the president\u2019s reaction after the discovery of millions-worth of fraudulent transactions between PhilHealth and a dialysis clinic.\n\nThe dated reports were misleadingly re-shared on May 3 in various Facebook (FB) groups, where netizens could only see a thumbnail and the headlines:\n\u2022 \u201cSONA: President Duterte, pinagbibitiw ang presidente at board members ng PhilHealth (SONA: President Duterte asks PhilHealth president and board members to resign).\u201d\n\nThe posts in FB groups RAFFY TULFO IN ACTION ADMINS GROUP S MEMBER, Solid Duterte Supporters Worldwide and Filipino Tambayan -- which were among the top traffic generators to the old stories -- bore captions expressing frustration at PhilHealth\u2019s move and supported Duterte\u2019s supposed order. Their comment sections drew mixed reactions, with some expressing anger at the state insurer while many pointing out the stories\u2019 old publishing date.\n\nThe misleading posts surfaced as a change.org petition gained traction over the weekend, with over 400,000 people protesting the increase of premium payments of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) from 2.75% in 2019 to 3% this year. The increase comes after PhilHealth published Circular 2020-0014 on April 2, mandating OFWs to pay additional premiums in compliance with the Universal Health Care Act of 2019, a landmark piece of legislation of the Duterte administration.\n\nOn May 4, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced that Duterte has ordered the payment of Philhealth premiums for OFWs to be made voluntary.\n\nThe misleading posts have gained over 1,100 shares, more than a thousand reactions and over 500 comments.
