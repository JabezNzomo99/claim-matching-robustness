Very powerful,\u201d Wolf saying during the special, according to NewsBusters. \u201cYou know how people say you can\u2019t play God? I walked out of there being like, \u2018Move over Morgan Freeman, I am God!\u2019\u201d the female comedian continued, referring to the movie \u201cBruce Almighty.\u201d\n\nThe right-leaning NewsBusters website had earlier published a similar article that carried the headline \u201cComedian Michelle Wolf Jokes Abortion Made Her \u2018Feel Very Powerful,\u2019 Like \u2018God.'\u201d\n\nThe remarks came around 25 minutes into Wolf\u2019s 2019 stand-up comedy Netflix special \u201cJoke Show.\u201d She reflected on the issue of abortion, broadly presenting a permissive attitude towards it and musing that \u201cIf it\u2019s a big deal to you, it\u2019s a big deal. If it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not. Both are correct.\u201d Switching between the wider political and moral issue of abortion, and her own personal experiences, Wolf described her own abortion as \u201cnot a big deal.\u201d She then moved on to the segment that formed the basis of the Daily Wire and NewsBusters reports:\n\nWolf: \u2026 We don\u2019t talk about abortion in a real way. We talk about it in a very legislative way, but not in a real way. So I think a lot of women have a lot of apprehension surrounding it. You know, we talk about it so negatively that you feel like you should have this sense of shame after you get an abortion. Well you can feel any way you want after you get an abortion. Get one, see how you feel. [Audience laughs]. You know how my abortion made me feel? Very powerful. You know how people say you can\u2019t play God? [Gestures, audience laughs]. I walked out of there being like \u201cMove over Morgan Freeman, I am God!\u201d [Audience laughs]. And then I crossed the street very carefully. \u2018Cos that was the perfect time for God to be like \u201cYou\u2019re not God, bitch, here\u2019s a bus.\u201d [Audience laughs].\n\nBoth the Daily Wire and NewsBusters accurately quoted what Wolf said, and both acknowledged that her comments came in the context of a stand-up comedy performance. NewsBusters reflected that by specifying, in its headline, that Wolf had \u201cjoked.\u201d\n\nBoth websites have, in the past, defended other comedians against similarly outraged responses to jokes that some observers found offensive. In August, NewsBusters reported that \u201clefty media\u201d \u201ccan\u2019t take a joke,\u201d writing of the response to a series of jokes about trans issues by Dave Chappelle:\n\n\u201cHere we go. In the latest episode of \u2018Comedians In Heresy Getting Blacklisted,\u2019 legendary stand-up comedian Dave Chappelle has once again ran [sic] afoul of the politically correct crowd with jokes that refuse to kiss the ring of every insane progressive cause on the market. Leftwing sites like Vice and Slate couldn\u2019t handle Chappelle\u2019s jokes on trans people and cancel culture, recommending that viewers \u2018skip\u2019 his latest Netflix outing.\u201d\n\nThat NewsBusters article was written by the same author who later condemned Wolf\u2019s abortion joke.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Daily Wire in December defended Ricky Gervais against what it described as \u201cthe guardians of cancel culture,\u201d publishing an article with the headline \u201cWoke [Social Justice Warriors] Are Now Blasting Ricky Gervais For Making Another Trans Joke.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
