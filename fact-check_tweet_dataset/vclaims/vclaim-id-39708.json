The video shows huge crowd gathered in the stadium with the giant LED screen showing the photo of slain Texas Sikh police officer Sandeep Dhaliwal.Tweeting the clip, Singh claimed that it was a memorial service for Dhaliwal. In the same tweet, he also took a swipe at the 'HowdyModi\u2019 event which was held in the same stadium last week. The intent behind the tweet being that people gathered in large numbers at NRG stadium to pay homage to Dhaliwal and hence, the huge turnout for Modi\u2019s event is not a big deal after all.\u201cMemorial for Sikh police officer Sandeep Dhaliwal killed in the line of duty in Texas in the same stadium where \u201cHowdyModi\u201d was held. It\u2019s a packed stadium,\u201d tweeted Singh.Singh\u2019s tweet is misleading. People did not assemble at NRG stadium exclusively to commemorate the slain Sikh cop. They were there to watch a football match between Houston Texans and Carolina Panthers.Several Twitter users replied to Singh telling him that what he said gave wrong impression and did not present facts.Taking that as cue we used relevant keywords and found a news post by ABC13, which reported how American athletes and fans united to observe two minutes of silence for Indian-origin American Sheriff Dhaliwal before the start of National Football League (NFL) game between Houston Texans and Carolina Panthers.\u201cTens of thousands stopped to remember Sandeep Dhaliwal, the Harris County Sheriff's deputy killed in the line of duty last week.

The moment of silence at the Texans game is the latest in a list of events held this weekend\u201d the report stated.Times Fact Check has found the claim that people in Houston gathered at NRG stadium exclusively for Sandeep Dhaliwal\u2019s memorial to be misleading.
