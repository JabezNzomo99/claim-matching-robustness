One of the images shared as part of this set shows a reporter with many people standing in the background including a few wearing khakhi shorts resembling the old RSS uniform.\n\nThe image was also widely circulated by many on social media, including the Twitter handle Friends of RSS, which describes itself as an \u201cindependent initiative by Swayamsevaks\u201d.\n\nThe image is from 2012 Kerala floods\n\nThe photograph shared by RSS is not of the recent Kerala floods and was taken during the 2012 floods in the state. The reporter in the image had shared the image that same year.\n\nIn August 2012 flash floods triggered by heavy rains in Kozhikode and Kannur districts in north Kerala took the lives of nine people. An image of this event was shared as RSS workers providing aid during the recent Kerala floods. However, this isn\u2019t the only old image reshared with a false narrative.\n\nImages of 2017 Gujarat floods viral on social media as recent Kerala floods\n\nPurported images of RSS workers providing aid and relief to flood-stricken Kerala was widespread on social media with captions carrying a tinge of irony \u2013 \u201cLooks like Kerela couldn\u2019t kill all of those RSS Terrorists. Few of them are still alive and are looting the poor flood-struck Keralites.\u201d\n\nTwitter users Rishi Bagree and Rajesh KrishnanSimha circulated the same images that drew a combined share of 1,500.\n\nBJP MLA from Karnataka C.T. Ravi also shared photographs of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh\u2019s \u201chumanitarian efforts\u201d.\n\nHowever, these images are actually from Gujarat last year and not Kerala. SM Hoax Slayerfound identical images being circulated of RSS workers providing aid during Gujarat flood in August 2017. Multiple users on Facebook had shared the images.\n\nSevere monsoon flooding killed at least 213 in Gujarat last year. Over one lakh residents had to be relocated due to submergence of their homes.\n\nOld or unrelated images have been attributed to RSS several times in the past. In 2015, images of RSS workers in Gujarat was shared as them providing aid during the Nepal earthquake.\n\nDattatreya Hosabele, a senior RSS functionary based in Nepal, had denied the claims on social media as reported by Nistula Hebbar, the political editor of The Hindu.\n\nFurther, the official Twitter handle of RSS had also denied the claim of 20000 RSS workers having reached Nepal.\n\nLast year, Twitter handle @TrueIndology also falsely attributed a picture of a camp in late 1940s East Punjab to RSS.\n\nRecirculating old images as part of a recent or an unrelated event is a mischievous attempt to misinform people. It is advisable to verify photographs viral on social media before believing in them.\n\nUpdate: The official Facebook page of RSS which shared the old image has now updated the post and added a description to the picture, clarifying that it was clicked in 2012.", "lang": "en"}
