There has been intense amount of speculation that the trio was compelled to resign over their reportage which was deemed to be critical of the Central Government. Now, social media is rife with the claim that Punya Prasun Bajpai is all set to join NDTV from August 15.\n\nThe above post is by the Facebook page I support Ravish Kumar NDTV which has over 450,000 followers. It was posted on August 4 and has been shared more than 7600 times since. Another page, Team Ravish Kumar too posted this information on August 4 which has been shared over 2700 times. According to these posts, Bajpai will be on air from 8-9 pm followed by Ravish Kumar who will host the 9 pm show on NDTV. Other pages which have shared it include I am with Barkha Dutt,Andh Bhakt Mukt Bharat, Delhi Government Viral News and a page called Masterstroke, named after the prime time show on ABP News which was hosted by Bajpai.\n\nThis information has been widely circulated on Twitter as well. Cumulatively, this piece of information has been shared thousands of times across various platforms by now.\n\nNDTV has clarified that the said information is false. Speaking to Alt News, Suparna Singh, CEO of NDTV said, \u201cNDTV has always fought for and stood with independent, unbiased journalism. We covered the ABP controversy extensively on our channels. Our league of top anchors remains unchanged without any new additions.\u201c\n\nMisinformation spreads rapidly on social media, allowing little time for reflection or prudence. This is especially observed in cases where misinformation is likely to conform to an individual or group\u2019s political, ideological or religious bias. In this case, pages and accounts critical of the Central Government and the BJP put out this misleading information and many social media users opposed to the ruling party shared it merrily.", "lang": "en"}
