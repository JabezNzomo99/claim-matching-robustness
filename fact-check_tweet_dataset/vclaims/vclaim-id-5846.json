This is outdated guidance that has since been changed.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nOne post reads: \u201cAs of the last 24 hours this is the protocol regarding masks \u2013 BAM! Spread the word!\u201d\n\nThe post shows a quote from Dr. April Baller, WHO Public Health Specialist, from March: \u201cMasks should only be used by healthcare workers, caretakers or by people who are sick with symptoms like fever and cough.\u201d\n\nThe digital version of this news report by Fox News can be found here . Although Baller said this in March, the article is dated May 29.\n\nThis guidance was on the WHO\u2019s website in March 2020 ( archive.vn/cwkJ3, Dr. Baller\u2019s video also visible here ). The organization explained in April that it was concerned about a shortage of medical masks due to mass use by the public ( here ).\n\nIn June 2020, the WHO updated its guidance, which now recommends that the public wear fabric masks in areas where there is community transmission and where social distancing cannot be maintained ( here ). An archived version of the website at the time can be seen archive.vn/4GI5a .\n\nAs of August 2020, the WHO\u2019s guidance on wearing masks remains the same ( here ). The organization also explains that medical masks should also be used by health workers, those with symptoms, those at risk and people caring for suspected or confirmed cases.\n\nThe WHO press office told Reuters via email that the guidance referred to in these claims \u201cis indeed no longer valid\u201d and \u201cdates back to February 2020\u201d. It added that the WHO \u201cregularly updates its guidance and advice to the public based on new scientific findings as the epidemic evolves\u201d and pointed to its most recent guidance from August 5, here .\n\nFox news has since issued reports reflecting the changes in the WHO\u2019s guidance, see here .\n\nReuters recently debunked similar claims that used outdated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance ( here and here ).\n\nFalse. WHO guidance and Fox news report are outdated and have since been updated.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact-checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
