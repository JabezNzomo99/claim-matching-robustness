(NASA says such a \u201cperihelic opposition,\u201d as it is known, occurs every 15 to 17 years.)\n\nWhile a perihelic opposition is happening this year, when Mars opposition takes place July 27, NASA says the planets won\u2019t be as close as they were in 2003. \u201cOur 2003 record will stand until August 28, 2287!\u201d NASA says.\n\nEven in 2003, Mars wasn\u2019t close enough to have \u201can apparent diameter as big as the Full Moon,\u201d which is what scienceinfo.news says will happen on July 27.\n\nThough Mars is nearly twice the size in diameter of the moon, Noble said Mars can never appear as big as the moon because of its distance from Earth. On July 31, when Mars reaches its closest point to Earth during its orbit \u2014 its so-called close approach \u2014 it\u2019s expected to be about 35.8 million miles away. By contrast, the moon is an average of 238,855 miles away from the Earth.\n\n\u201cThe distance from the Earth and the moon compared to the distance from Earth to Mars is enormous,\u201d Noble said.\n\nAlthough Mars opposition this summer will technically occur July 27, Noble said the planet\u2019s increased brightness in our sky is visible throughout the summer.\n\n\u201cIt will look like a very bright star, an orange-ish bright star,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s still going to be hard to pick it out in the night sky.\u201d\n\nIn other words, not like the moon.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
