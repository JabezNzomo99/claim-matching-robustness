Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has gotten plenty of attention.\n\nSometimes deservedly so. Sometimes not.\n\nA viral meme mocks the new representative for New York\u2019s 14th District for a statement about capitalism and socialism that she never made.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe graphic being shared displays an image of Ocasio-Cortez with the quote \"Under capitalism, man oppresses man. Under socialism, it\u2019s the other way around.\"\n\nThe only problem is \u2013 she never said it.\n\nWhere the quote comes from\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any instances when Ocasio-Cortez ever said that particular quote. And it would be strange if she did. Ocasio-Cortez describes herself as a democratic socialist and supports more socialist-style changes, including universal health care, tuition-free public college and establishing housing as a human right.\n\nThe quote comes in varying versions, with some words replacing others. It has been long attributed to economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who passed away in April 2006. It has also more recently been connected to another economist, Russell Roberts, who has used it during events and also in his book.\n\nThe original version of the phrase: \"Under capitalism man exploits man. Under socialism it\u2019s just the opposite.\" In some cases, the word socialism is swapped for communism, mostly when Galbraith is cited as the speaker.\n\nIt has also been described as an \"old Soviet joke,\" here, and according to Snopes, was listed as a \"wry Russian joke\" in Jules Archer\u2019s 1977 book Police State: Could It Happen Here?\n\nThe book was published 12 years before Ocasio-Cortez was born.\n\nA viral graphic being spread on social media claims that Ocasio-Cortez said \"under capitalism, man oppresses man. Under socialism, it\u2019s the other way around.\"\n\nThe phrase itself is a version of an old quote that is meant to disparage socialism or communism. Ocasio-Cortez, who calls herself a democratic socialist, never said those words.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
