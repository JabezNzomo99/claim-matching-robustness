(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe text in the post has, with some variations, been circulating online for about two decades. FactCheck.org fact-checked it in November 2010. Snopes tackled it in June 2000.\n\nThat\u2019s about a year after Barbara Walters hosted a special for ABC News that aired on April 30, 1999, called, \"A Celebration: 100 Years of Great Women.\" Fonda was one of the women selected by the Ladies Home Journal as one of the 100 most important women of the 20th century.\n\nWalters described Fonda at different points in her life as a sex kitten, an activist and a wife. She said Fonda stopped acting in the 1990s and \"now spends much of her time on her favorite cause, preventing teenage pregnancy.\"\n\nShe doesn\u2019t say what the Facebook post attributes to her. She also didn\u2019t say it in 1988, when she interviewed Fonda, who apologized for her participation in being photographed while seated in a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun in 1972, according to an ABC News transcript we found in the Nexis news archive.\n\n\"Jane Fonda told me that she now realizes in her urgent desire to end the war, she unthinkingly caused pain to many Americans who fought in Vietnam,\" Walters said. \"In our interview tonight, she speaks directly to former prisoners of war, to Vietnam veterans and their families. And confronting her past, she then apologizes.\"\n\nSearching Nexis further, we couldn\u2019t find evidence that Walters said or wrote the statement that appears in the Facebook post. There were no results when we searched Newspapers.com. Looking online we couldn\u2019t find a credible source connecting Walters to the viral message either.", "lang": "en"}
