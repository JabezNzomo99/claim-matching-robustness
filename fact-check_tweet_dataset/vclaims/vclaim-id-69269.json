I mean, imagine if nurses had to go buy their own syringes. #ugh,\" Fischer tweeted on Dec. 23.\n\nThe tweet attracted 66,000 retweets and 223,000 likes. (Fischer has about 750,000 followers.)\n\nBut the tweet was wrong, relying on an outdated proposal. (After this fact-check was posted, Fischer deleted the tweet; see \"After the Fact\" below.)\n\nAn existing provision in the tax code has allowed teachers to deduct eligible, unreimbursed classroom spending up to $250. The provision was expanded and made permanent in December 2015.\n\nThe tax bill unveiled by House Republicans in November would have scrapped the deduction. But amid an outcry from teachers and their allies -- we wrote about opposition from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., here -- it was stripped before the House and Senate passed identical versions of the bill and President Trump signed it on Dec. 22. (The Senate bill actually would have doubled the deduction, but that idea was rejected too.)\n\nA number of Twitter users pointed this out, including one identified as Matt Rossetto, who snarked later that day that Fischer\u2019s tweet \"is 100% wrong, because the final bill KEPT this deduction, but 14,000 RT\u2019s later...\"\n\nFischer noticed Rossetto\u2019s tweet and fired back, \"It was capped at $250 which is woefully insufficient especially considering they shouldn't have to go out of pocket at all. #iloveteachers.\"\n\nSome Twitter users, however, still found fault with Fischer, since $250 was always the limit for that particular deduction -- it was not lowered due to the new law. Rossetto, for instance, tweeted back, \"It WAS $250 before the bill and hasn\u2019t changed. If you\u2019re going to grandstand, get it right.\"\n\nFinally, on Christmas Day, Fischer returned to Twitter to acknowledge her critics.\n\nShe tweeted, \"Thanks for your tweets! I had some facts wrong. Teachers surveyed by Scholastic in 2016 personally spent an average of $530 on school supplies for students. Teachers who worked at high-poverty schools spent an average of $672. The tax deduction was capped at $250.\"\n\nFischer didn\u2019t explicitly acknowledge that the $250 limit existed before the Republican-backed bill, but she was right on the other statistics. They refer to a national survey of 4,721 public school educators for Scholastic by the firm YouGov in July and August 2016.\n\nAs of the time this article was published, however, Fischer\u2019s initial correction tweet had garnered far less interest than her original one -- 830 retweets and about 6,600 likes.\n\nFischer tweeted that after enactment of the Republican tax bill, \"school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes.\"\n\nAs numerous Twitter users pointed out, that is incorrect -- the newly signed tax bill does not affect the existing deduction for teacher expenses. Fischer later acknowledged that \"I had some facts wrong\" and deleted the tweet.", "lang": "en"}
