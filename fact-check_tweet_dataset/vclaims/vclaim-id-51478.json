It is being said that this damage took place during the Beirut explosion.\n\nThe claim is viral mainly on the Facebook in English and Urdu languages.\n\nThe post has been shared with a caption, \u201cAfter the devastating explosion, burnt imported cars on the port of Beirut.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The picture being shared on the social media is related to a 2015 explosion which occurred in China.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nWhile doing a reverse search of the image, we found it in a BBC report related to the twin explosions which had occurred in the Tianjin city of China in the year 2015. In this report, the image was credited to the Associated Press.\n\nMore than 100 people had lost their lives in these explosions which had occurred in a warehouse in the port area of Tianjin which was said to be caused by the illegal storage of 11,300 tonne of hazardous chemicals.\n\nTianjin port is one of China\u2019s biggest automobile shipping ports. According to a Financial Times report, cars worth around 625 million dollars, belonging to various automobile manufacturers, were destroyed in this incident.\n\nWe found the same viral picture in several other news reports as well. Some such reports can be viewed here, here and here.\n\nThe recent explosion at Lebanon\u2019s capital Beirut was of over 2,700 tonne of ammonium nitrate stored for around six years in a warehouse near the Beirut port.\n\nBut this particular picture which is being circulated on social media is not related to this recent blast. It is related to the explosions which had occurred in Tianjin, China in the year 2015.", "lang": "en"}
