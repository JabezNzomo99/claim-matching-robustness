India contacted an airstrike in Belahiya. In the resulting, we\u2019ve shot down one Indian HAL Rudra and captured one Indian pilot. Now We\u2019ll not return pilot to india, \u201d the caption read.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the video and found that the claim is false as the video in question is old.\n\nOn extracting the keyframes of the video and putting them through Reverse Image Search, we found the same video on the YouTube channel of The Telegraph, dated October 17, 2012.\n\nTaking a cue from the above information, we ran a search using relevant keywords and found a report by The Guardian dated October 17, 2012.\n\nHence, we can conclude that it is an old video from Syria and has no connection with India or Nepal.", "lang": "en"}
