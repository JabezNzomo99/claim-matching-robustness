He actually opposed its suspension.\n\nBefore federal Judge Alex Kozinski abruptly retired amid sexual harassment allegations late last year, he made news for a scathing dissent he wrote.\n\nIn his March 2017 dissenting opinion, Kozinski criticized three of his colleagues on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for their decision to uphold a lower court\u2019s temporary block on President Donald Trump\u2019s original executive order instituting a travel ban on people from several predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nKozinski argued, for example, that the panel\u2019s rationale that the executive order violated due process rights was misplaced because only a small fraction of the affected foreigners was entitled to due process. \u201cThis St. Bernard is being wagged by a flea on its tail,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut a handful of conservative websites this month posted a story that falsely describes Kozinski as a judge who \u201cstruck down\u201d the travel ban, and presents the harassment allegations from last year as current news.\n\n\u201c9th Circuit Judge Who Struck Down Trump\u2019s Muslim Travel Ban Busted In Sleazy Scandal,\u201d reads the Dec. 5 headline on rightwing.news. The story earned thousands of shares on Facebook, and was also recently published on investmentwatchblog.com and therepublicanfighter.com.\n\nThe story goes on to include portions of two news articles \u2014 one from the Harvard Crimson and one from the Washington Post \u2014 about the allegations against Kozinski, who stepped down in December 2017.\n\nBut after that, the misleading story continues: \u201cNow that\u2019s sick, but then again, what else can we expect from a judge from the infamous 9th circuit court who is known for its radical far left agenda leanings.\u201d The article refers twice to Kozinski as \u201cliberal.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Kozinski was widely known to be a conservative. He was nominated to the court by Republican President Ronald Reagan and was confirmed by the Senate in 1985, despite resistance from most Democrats.\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration\u2019s third iteration of the travel ban.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 21: After we published our story, Right Wing News changed its headline to reflect that Kozinski had not \u201cstruck down\u201d the travel ban. \u201cOur headline was incorrect,\u201d the website noted in an update. The website also removed all references to Kozinski being \u201cliberal\u201d and \u201cfar left\u201d in its story.\n\nRyan, Aidan F. \u201cHarvard Law Student Group Cheers Changes to Federal Court\u2019s Sexual Harassment Policies.\u201d The Harvard Crimson. 30 Nov 2018.\n\nState of Washington and State of Minnesota v.
