Sensationalism at its best \u2013 complete fiction so that people get more likes on their page. The photo with the fake story has been shared hundreds of thousands of times on various social media. I am getting inundated by hundreds and hundreds of messages asking me whether I am the \u201cdepressed photographer\u201d. I have been tagged in LinkedIn with the fake story \u2013 that\u2019s going to do wonders for my career. What a vile world we live in, full of stupid gullible people spreading #fakenews like crazy, \u201d she wrote.\n\nSharing the original story on her website, Alison wrote, \u201cNarasha, the cheetah mom, was teaching her youngsters how to kill prey. However, they were a bit slow on the uptake and they were playing with the hapless Impala prey instead of killing it. Narasha, the cheetah mom is the one that is grabbing the impala by the neck in all the photos.\u201d\n\nThe above information proves that the viral narrative being shared with the picture is FAKE.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
