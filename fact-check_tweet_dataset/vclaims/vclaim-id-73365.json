The claim is misleading; in July 2020, Duterte signed an executive order to conduct a study on the country\u2019s nuclear power policy; as of August 31, 2020, legislative records show the president has not enacted a law to open a nuclear power plant.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on August 27, 2020. The post has been shared more than 1,800 times.\n\nThe photo shows an image of Duterte alongside an image of the late president Ferdinand Marcos. Under Marcos\u2019 term from 1965 to 1986, the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant was built but never used.\n\nIts text overlay states: \"Philippines finally nuclear / Already signed / Solid Duterte page / This is surprising Philippine nuclear plant finally signed olig (sic)...\"\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \"Meralco oligarchs would weep / Hope this gets opened soon so we don't pay high electricity bills anymore\".\n\nMeralco is the largest private sector electricity distributor in the country, according to its corporate profile.\n\nA similar claim was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nIn response to the posts, Michel Kristian Ablan, an assistant secretary at the presidential communications office, told AFP the most recent measure signed by the president related to nuclear power was this executive order.\n\n\u201cNot a law. But an EO. Executive Order No. 116, s. 2020. Signed on July 24, 2020,\u201d Ablan said by text message.\n\nThe order does not mention opening a nuclear power plant, but states in part: \u201cThe government shall conduct a study for the adoption of a National Position on a Nuclear Energy Program\u2026 Review the existing legal framework, study the viability of nuclear energy, and recommend the necessary steps in the utilization of nuclear energy, as well as existing facilities such as but not limited to the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant\u201d.\n\nMultiple keyword searches on the websites of the Philippine House of Representatives here and Senate here show there was no legislative measure to open a nuclear power plant signed in August 2020.", "lang": "en"}
