Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of a suspected COVID-19 patient running away from doctors and police in Telangana. Fact: The posted video is not related to Telangana. The incident in the video took place in Kerala. The man in the video came from Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) recently and was supposed to be under quarantine. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, a similar video was found in the search results. \u2018The New Indian Express\u2019 has posted the same video on its YouTube channel on 6 July 2020. In the description of the video, it can be read that the incident in the video took place in Pathanamthitta town (Kerala). The man in the video came from Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) recently and was supposed to be under quarantine. On Monday, the Police found him roaming without a mask. As the man has refused to go into quarantine, he was forcibly taken by the health officials. The news articles regarding the incident can be read here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, the incident in the video took place in Kerala, not in Telangana.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
