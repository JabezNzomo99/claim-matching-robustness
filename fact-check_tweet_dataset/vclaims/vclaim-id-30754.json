Some 47 people were on the island at the time, many of them tourists. When the dust settled, authorities confirmed that at least 20 people were killed.\n\nA few weeks later, a video that supposedly showed the eruption circulated on social media:\n\nWhile New Zealand\u2019s White Island (or Whakaari) volcano truly erupted in December 2019, this video did not document that event.\n\nThe video above was actually a simulation created by the Auckland War Memorial Museum. The museum shared this footage to its YouTube page under the title \u201cAuckland Museum Volcano Simulation \u2013 Auckland Museum\u201d and explained it was \u201can educational simulation of an earthquake caused by a volcanic eruption.\u201d\n\nThe simulation was also on display in the museum\u2019s Volcanoes Gallery.\n\nAuckland Museum, with support from EQC, the Earthquake Commission, are proud to present a dynamic permanent natural history exhibition: Volcanoes. This rare look at our turbulent geological home is an up close and personal examination of the scientific and human stories of volcanoes. The highly interactive exhibition will give visitors a walk through deep sea black smokers and also a grandstand as-live view of a volcanic eruption in Auckland.\n\nPlenty of real photographs and videos documenting the White Island eruption were available online.\n\nThis image, for instance, was taken by photographer Michael Schade (available via Getty Images):\n\nAllessandro Kauffmann had a close and terrifying view. The Brazilian tourist shared a video on Instagram showing the volcano erupting as his boat raced away from the island:\n\nAnd NBC News reporter Emmanuelle Saliba compiled this \u201cminute-by-minute\u201d look:", "lang": "en"}
