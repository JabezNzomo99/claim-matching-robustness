No, that's not true: It is a false conspiracy based on the United Nation's use of bio-metric -- including fingerprints and facial scans -- to keep track of war refugees during a crisis in 2015. There has been no \"decree\" by the U.N. and the world body has not debated use of implanted microchips in the all humans.\n\nThe story first began spreading after the U.N. announced it was using bio-metrics to track refugees in 2015, and has continued with an article (archived here) published in March, 2019 under the title \"The United Nations has decreed that humanity should place the microchip\". It opened:\n\nBy 2030, the UN plans for each person to have a biometric identification, which will be approved worldwide. The information of every human being will be stored in a universal database, located in Geneva, Switzerland. The organization of the United Nations is addressed to all the governments of the world, which impose the \"Universal Biometric Identification\" card to its citizens. 'This new program is a model for the 'New World Order,' and if you enter the subprojects for these new global goals, you will find things very alarming,' reports The Economic Collapse.\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe body of the false story references the 2015 program to use bio-metrics -- not implanted microchips -- to track refugees:\n\nThe United Nations has implemented this project among refugees who have arrived in Europe. The system collects the face, the iris and the biometric data from the fingerprints, settling in the only official documentation for refugees.\n\n\n\nThe information will be sent to a central database in Geneva, allowing in practice its follow-up.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Find Biometrics report, the authorities hope that this technology will enable them to achieve the goal of having this kind of identification for men, women and children on the planet, within reach of their hands in 2030.\n\nThe first two paragraphs are not false, but there is no evidence to support the third paragraph's claim that it is part of a longer term plan to identify every human on earth by 2030. This is what the FInd Biometrics report referenced above really said about the 2015 program:\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is moving forward with its plans to use biometric technology to identify and track refugees, and has selected a vendor for the project. Accenture, an international technology services provider, has won out in the competitive tendering process and will oversee the implementation of the technology in a three-year contract.\n\n\n\nThe UNHCR will use Accenture's Biometric Identity Management System (BIMS) for the endeavor. BIMS can be used to collect facial, iris, and fingerprint biometric data, and will also be used to provide many refugees with their only form of official documentation. The system will work in conjunction with Accenture's Unique Identity Service Platform (UISP) to send this information back to a central database in Geneva, allowing UNHCR offices all over the world to effectively coordinate with the central UNHCR authority in tracking refugees.\n\nThis is a lot less sinister than the implanted microchips mentioned in the headline. Eye and facial scans are becoming as common as fingerprints for identifying people. It is not a United Nations mandate, though.\n\nThe website Point of No Return described itself as \"Exposing the Truth - Death to the illuminati, Secret Societies and New World Order!
