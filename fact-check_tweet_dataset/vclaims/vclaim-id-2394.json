But the same headline and story appeared on the World News Circle website, or usarightwing.com, nearly two months prior to that.\n\nThe story, unlike the false headline, says that \u201cthe student government association at a University in Kentucky, have voted to recommend that the university makes tuition \u2018free\u2019 for all the black students attending the college.\u201d That part is true.\n\nIn April, the Student Government Association at Western Kentucky University passed a \u201cResolution to Support Reparations\u201d to \u201cacknowledge that there is a debt that will never be paid\u201d to the university\u2019s black students because of slavery.\n\nThe resolution, which passed by a 19-10 vote, called for, among other things, all black people to have \u201cfull and free access\u201d to attend the university.\n\nResolution 6-17-S, April 18: Be it resolved that the Student Government Association of Western Kentucky University support Reparations for Black Students at WKU. We call for a special task force be [sic] established by the University to assess the feasibility of test-optional admissions and geographically-weighted admissions. Admissions criteria at Western Kentucky are subject to policies put forth by the Board of Regents, and thus this task force should work with both internal and external stakeholders to develop its assessment. We demand reparations for the systemic denial of access to high quality educational opportunities in the form of full and free access for all black people (including undocumented, currently and formerly incarcerated people) to Western Kentucky University.\n\nBut the resolution is not binding and has not been implemented. The university\u2019s then-president, Gary A. Ransdell, issued a statement two days after the resolution passed saying that the school has no intention of making classes free for black students.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the Student Government Association\u2019s interest in these issues, but it\u2019s important to clarify that their resolution is not an official position taken by the University,\u201d Ransdell\u2019s statement said. \u201cI have read the SGA resolution, and I understand that their intent was to spark a conversation, but the University will not adopt any such policy.\u201d\n\nEven the resolution\u2019s co-authors, Andrea Ambam and Brian Anderson, told the university\u2019s student newspaper that the measure was mostly a way to start a dialogue.\n\n\u201cWhile the resolution calls for free tuition for black students, we\u2019re not expecting that to materialize anytime soon,\u201d Anderson wrote in a letter to the College Heights Herald. \u201cWhat we do believe could come as a result of this legislation though, is a greater understanding from the university that more can be done for students that don\u2019t benefit from systems that traditionally benefit white students like standardized testing for financial aid.\u201d\n\nAnderson added: \u201cOur hope is that as a result of this resolution, power structures that have been upheld to privilege a select few can be changed for the greater benefit of all.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cUniversity Will Give Black Students Free Tuition As Apology For Slavery.\u201d Therightwingportal.com. 6 Sep 2017.\n\nWorld News Circle. \u201cUniversity Will Give Black Students Free Tuition As Apology For Slavery.\u201d Usarightwing.com. 15 Jul 2017.\n\nWilliams, Jamie. \u201cSGA passes resolution to support reparations for all black students.\u201d Collegiate Heights Herald. 18 Apr 2017.\n\nRansdell, Gary. \u201cStatement from WKU President Gary A.
