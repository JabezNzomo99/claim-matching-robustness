Claims are being made that he set himself on fire due to hunger and unemployment.\n\n\u201cKhudaya REHAM\n\n Hungry jobless Youth Pour Petrol on Himself And Put on Fire\n\n #Hyderabad kaha Ja raha hai India #zulm #muder #indiagoverment #shame\u201d the caption read.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the claim attached to the video to be false.\n\nWhen we extracted keyframes of the video and put them through Reverse Image Search, we found the same video on Twitter with a claim that the man committed suicide after fighting with his wife.\n\nTaking a clue from the above tweet, we then ran another Reverse Image Search along with the keywords \u2018Hyderabad\u2019, \u2018man\u2019, \u2018fire\u2019 and \u2018wife\u2019.\n\nWe found a news report by Sakshi Post dated May 15, 2020, with the title, \u201cMan Sets Himself Ablaze In Hyderabad\u2019s Jeedimetla.\u201d The featured image of the article was a screengrab of the video in question.\n\nThe incident was also covered by other media outlets like Telangana Today and Sakshi TV.\n\nAccording to the report published in Telangana Today, the man was identified as Bhuvan Surya, who was working as a sales executive in a private company. The report also suggested that he attempted to commit suicide after his wife refused to live with him.\n\nSpeaking to ANI, PV Padmaja, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Balanagar said, \u201cToday 35-year-old Bhuvan Reddy set himself ablaze at his residence. He was upset after his wife refused to live with him. Twenty days ago a heated discussion took place between Bhuvan Reddy and his wife. The woman later went away to her sister\u2019s residence.\u201d\n\nFrom the above information, we can deduce that the man in the video was not jobless and his reason for attempted suicide was different from the ones mentioned in the claims.\n\n Hence, the viral claim is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
