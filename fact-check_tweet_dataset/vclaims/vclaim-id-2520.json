According to NHS Providers, it seems to be the worst financial crisis in NHS history. 80% of acute hospitals now in deficit. There was a time in 2010, when the NHS was in surplus. What happened?\u201d\n\nThe latest figures show that 75% of acute trusts (hospitals) are in deficit.\n\nIn 2014 the regulator reported that 80% of acute trusts were in deficit. We\u2019ve asked NHS Providers exactly where their figure comes from.\n\nAcute trusts are only one type of NHS provider. Overall, 153 of the 238 providers of NHS services were in deficit at the end of June 2016. Two thirds of them were acute trusts.\n\nOnly 8% of NHS providers were in deficit back in 2009/10, according to the King\u2019s Fund think tank. Since then increasing numbers of trusts have ended each year in deficit. The problem varies by sector though: mental health, specialist and community trusts have been in surplus over the past three years.\n\nNHS Providers is a membership group for organisations that supply NHS services, like your local hospital. It has said that trusts are reporting \u201cthe largest deficit in NHS history\u201d. Experts at the King\u2019s Fund agree.", "lang": "en"}
