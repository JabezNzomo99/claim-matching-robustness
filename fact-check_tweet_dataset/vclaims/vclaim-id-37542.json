However, the video used in the reports shows a 2016 news clip about an unrelated incident. Also, the man is a Filipino-Canadian soldier and the Canadian Armed Forces confirmed to AFP that he is still alive.\n\nIn December 2018 a video showing a boy at Ateneo Junior High School beating up another in a toilet bloc went viral and became a mainstream media story. The school subsequently dismissed one of the boys over the incident.\n\nHere is an article from one of the major news channels in the Philippines reporting on the boy\u2019s dismissal, and here is the school\u2019s statement.\n\nThe reports, when shared over Facebook and Twitter, have the photo montage below with a headline that, when translated to English, says: \u201cA man who went on a vacation to the Philippines and challenged the father of [the accused bully] to a fight has been found dead\u201d.\n\n\n\nAFP greyed out the faces of the accused bully and brother because they are children. The faces of the girls were already blurred in the false posts. AFP also greyed out the boy\u2019s name in the text of the false post.\n\n\u201cBy the way, my name is JP Otazu. I\u2019m just here on vacation, I\u2019m from Canada,\u201d he says. He adds at the latter part that he has been a soldier in the Canadian army for 20 years.\n\nAFP sent the photo montage and the link of the false report to the Canadian Armed Forces. A spokesperson confirmed that the man in the photo is Otazu and the the reports on his death are false.", "lang": "en"}
