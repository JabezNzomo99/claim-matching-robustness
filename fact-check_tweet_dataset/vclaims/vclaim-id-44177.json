The clip is viral at a time when reports of swarms of desert locusts ravaging crops and farmlands in parts of Western India have emerged.

The person shooting the video films her experience in the clip, as she stays put inside the parked car. \n\n\n\nTaking cue from the caption of the video, we were able to find the same video which was uploaded on viral content aggregator, Viral Hog's official YouTube channel in April this year. According to the description, the incident is from December, 2016, Carrollton, Texas. BOOM reached out to Viral Hog, which confirmed that the video is four years old, and was shot on December 6, 2016.\n\nThe YouTube footage carries a first person account of the woman who shot the video. \"I left H-mart and was returning to my car with groceries. I noticed the birds were very noisy as I was leaving, but the sky wasn't filled with them as bad as shown in the video. I got to my car while some people waiting at the entrance of the building watching. They were smart for waiting because in the next minute, my car got pooped on big time. As you can see, the area filled with birds very quickly. Apparently, these are blackbirds and they gather just as the sun goes down. I don't know the exact scientific reason for it, but there is one and it happens often. I remember seeing groups of birds like this a lot when I was younger, but it was never ever this many!\"\n\nBelow is a comparison of frames from the viral video and the original clip uploaded on YouTube. \n\n\n\nHere is a Google street view of the H Market in Carrollton, Texas, which matches the visuals of the viral video.\n\nThe video was earlier viral with claims that crows were coming to Texas after an attack on China's Wuhan. The same was debunked by AFP. Read AFP's fact check here.", "lang": "en"}
