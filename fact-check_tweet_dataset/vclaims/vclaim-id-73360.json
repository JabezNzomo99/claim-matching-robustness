The post has been shared more than 3,200 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSister of Kapil Mishra, who led the Hindu-Muslim riots in Delhi, gets married to Shahzad Ali. Congratulations to Kapil Mishra and bhakts for their new brother-in-law.\u201d\n\nKapil Mishra is a vocal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politician in the Indian capital of Delhi, which witnessed widespread communal violence earlier this year. He was elected in 2015 to Delhi\u2019s Legislative Assembly from the Aam Aadmi Party, but joined the BJP in 2019 after being disqualified as a lawmaker and expelled from the AAP.\n\nThe photo was also shared alongside an identical claim on Facebook here, here, here and here; and on Twitter here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the photo was published on April 18, 2016 here in a news report about an interfaith wedding.\n\nThe photo was also published in by The Hindu, a major Indian newspaper, here on the same day.\n\nAccording to the reports, Ashitha Babu, a Hindu woman, married Shakeel Ahmed, a Muslim man, at a ceremony that was under tight security after a Hindu group publicly opposed the union.\n\nThe interfaith wedding was also reported by several other Indian media outlets; for example here on April 18, 2016 by NDTV Hindi and here by The Indian Express on April 24, 2016.\n\nNDTV also published this video report about the wedding on April 17, 2020, in which the bride\u2019s father, Dr Narendra Babu, can be heard voicing his support for the marriage.\n\nKapil Mishra\u2019s father is not named Dr Narendra Babu on his official Delhi Assembly member profile. Hi father's name is given as R P Mishra, i.e. Rameshwar Prasad Mishra.", "lang": "en"}
