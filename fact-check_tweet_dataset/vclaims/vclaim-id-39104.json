The vaccination in this image is for a strain that affects cattle, bovine coronavirus. This causes diarrhoea in calves.\n\nThe coronavirus at the centre of the 2019/2020 epidemic is known as SARS-CoV-2 and causes the disease known as Covid-19, which primarily affects the respiratory system. While coronaviruses as a family have been known about since the 1960s, this particular strain of human coronavirus is new, and no vaccine for it exists yet.\n\nScientists are currently developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. All vaccine candidates are currently in the preclinical stage, and therefore will not be available in the immediate future.", "lang": "en"}
