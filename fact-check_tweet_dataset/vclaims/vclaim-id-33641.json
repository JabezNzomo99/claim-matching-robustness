No, that's not true: the story originated on a satire website but many people only saw the headline on Facebook and believed it was true.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Genesius Times on November 13, 2019 titled \"Greta's global warming conference cancelled due to sub-arctic freezing temps\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA symposium sponsored by the International Global Warming Trust was cancelled today in Michigan as temperatures dipped below -50 degrees F. Experts were quick to dispel the notion that low temperatures meant that their theory of global warming was incorrect. Greta Thunberg, teen climate activist, had hitched a ride on a hot air balloon powered by her own fiery breath to arrive at the conference in order to yell, \"How dare you?\" at everyone only to be turned away with hypothermia. \"No, you see you're not nuanced enough,\" Klaus Fullofit of Norway said in a post-conference interview. \"The fact that it's so cold doesn't mean that the planet is not warming. Only in your unscientific mind is that the case.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nFirst of all, there is no organization named the \"International Global Warming Trust\". And the name \"Klaus Fullofit\" is a dead giveaway the story is just a joke.\n\nThe website Genesius Times that originally published the story has a header that reads \"THE MOST RELIABLE SOURCE OF FAKE NEWS ON THE PLANET\". In addition to that there is also a disclaimer in the footer that reads:\n\nHowever that was not clear to many people who only saw the headline on Facebook and didn't click through to the full story. Here is just a small sampling of comments from people who seem to have taken the story at face value:\n\nThese people also didn't notice the Genesius Times ran almost the exact same story in January of 2019, including the same fake names for conference attendees:", "lang": "en"}
