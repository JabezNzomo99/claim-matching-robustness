AIR had recorded a compilation of Nava Durga Stotra on PM Modi's special request, in which Jitendra Singh was roped in to record nine different pieces along with other artists reported India Today on September 25, 2017.\n\nPM Modi had also tweeted the mantra with a link on the sixth day of the Navratri week on October 15, 2018.
