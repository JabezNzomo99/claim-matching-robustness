But his purported links to antifa are either false, fabricated or unsubstantiated.\n\nAuthorities have identified Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada, as the shooter who opened fire on a crowd of more than 22,000 from his 32nd-floor hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on Oct. 1, killing 59 people and injuring more than 500.\n\nPolice have not yet found a motive for the massacre, but they have said that Paddock acted alone.\n\n\u201cWe believe Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act,\u201d Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo said at a press conference on Oct. 2.\n\nA site called neon-nettle.com posted a story on Oct. 2 with the headline: \u201cLas Vegas Shooting Exposed as Antifa-led False Flag Attack.\u201d That site based Paddock\u2019s links to antifa on a pair of fabricated tweets attributed to President Donald Trump. (As we have written before, it is easy to make up a fake tweet using free software programs available on the internet.)\n\nThe neon-nettle.com story claimed that Trump\u2019s first tweet was posted at 6:52 a.m. on Oct. 2 and said: \u201cMy heart and prayers got [sic] out to the victim\u2019s families of the Las Vegas massacre. The FBI tells me that Stephen Paddock was a known Antifa\u2026\u201d\n\nThe second tweet purportedly went out at 6:59 a.m. and said: \u201c\u2026member! It\u2019s time for people to get off their knees and take this country back from the real terrorists!\u201d\n\nThe story said that the tweets were later deleted, but an Internet Archive screen shot of Trump\u2019s Twitter page just minutes after they would have been posted shows no evidence of them.\n\nNo major news outlets have written about those tweets, but a similar story ran on ProudTrumpers.com and SundayPost.org, which is registered to an owner in Australia. Both websites show images of the bogus tweets.\n\nThe popular conservative website called infowars.com also claims that Paddock was connected to antifa, saying an unnamed source told the website that the FBI found antifa literature in Paddock\u2019s hotel room. But the FBI has made no such announcement.\n\nInfowars.com also says that Paddock didn\u2019t kill himself, but, rather, was killed by an \u201cFBI hostage rescue team.\u201d But law enforcement agencies say that\u2019s not true.\n\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, which is the lead agency in the investigation, said in a statement that its own special weapons and tactics, or SWAT, team, not the FBI, went into Paddock\u2019s hotel room, where he was already dead. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo also told reporters that Paddock killed himself before police entered the room.\n\nIn addition to unsubstantiated claims of antifa literature being found in Paddock\u2019s hotel room, the website YourNewsWire.com claimed Paddock \u201cwas an Antifa member\u201d based in part on a Facebook post from an account claiming to be the Melbourne, Australia, branch of antifa. We could not authenticate that Facebook account, and another group claims it is fake.\n\nThe disputed Facebook post \u2014 which has been circulating online and has been covered as news by the Daily Mail in the U.K. \u2014 said: \u201cOne of our comrades from our Las Vegas branch has made these fascist Trump supporting dogs pay.\u201d The post has since been deleted from the group\u2019s page, but the Internet Archive captured a picture of the page that contains the post.\n\nWe sent a message to the group on Oct. 2 inquiring about the post, but we haven\u2019t received a response.\n\nHowever, there is a reason to question that Facebook page\u2019s authenticity.\n\nWe discovered another Facebook account \u2014 Melbourne Antifascist Info \u2014 which has more than three times as many followers, is connected to other like-minded groups online, and has been more active for a longer time than the other group claiming to be Melbourne Antifa. Both pages have the exact same description of themselves in the \u201cAbout\u201d section.\n\nWe traded Facebook messages with a moderator of Melbourne Antifascist Info who said that the other account is an imposter. The moderator, who declined to be identified, disavowed the controversial Facebook post, saying it was \u201csomething they said to be shocking and stir up trouble.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that a deleted post from the other Facebook page has been quoted in a news article \u2014 in June, the Sydney Morning Herald cited a deleted post from that page in a story about conservative commentator Andrew Bolt fighting off two men who threw glitter at him on the street.\n\nThat story quoted the Melbourne Antifa page as saying: \u201c\u2018some of our family in solidarity were attacked by Andrew Bolt while they were protesting today\u2019 and said Bolt should be jailed for his \u2018violent, horrendous language.'\u201d\n\nIn a public post after that news story ran, Melbourne Antifascist Info said: \u201cMELBOURNE ANTIFA IS FAKE. It is run as a honeypot to catch leftists and skew the media image of antifascism from an alt-right perspective. They\u2019re trolls, and you\u2019ve been got.\u201d\n\nThe number of fake social media accounts made to look like antifa groups has been growing recently, according to stories published by ThinkProgress.org and BuzzFeed.\n\n\u201cThe accounts are being set up as a way to mock Antifa, and to discredit it by tweeting out hoaxes and offensive comments,\u201d according to the BuzzFeed article.", "lang": "en"}
