Among other things, this show claimed that this town was the site of a \u201ccult compound shooting\u201d that left 14 people dead in the 1960s, that a teenager mysteriously disappeared after entering a restricted area in 2016 and was most likely eaten by a Wendigo (a mythological creature), and that a military operation in the area went haywire after the soldiers stumbled upon a group of occultists.\n\nWe\u2019ll point out some specific inaccuracies throughout this article, but by and large \u201cHelltown\u201d is a work of fiction. This is a scripted piece of entertainment and not a genuine documentary. The experts, townspeople, police officers, and even the soldiers in the \u201carchival\u201d or \u201cfound footage\u201d are actors.\n\n\u201cHelltown\u201d first aired on the Travel Channel just before Halloween in 2017, but it still frequently gets re-aired. Here\u2019s a trailer for the movie. It starts with a brief disclaimer noting that \u201cthis story is inspired by accounts of a real American town that has been abandoned for more than 40 years.\u201d It isn\u2019t until the final frames of the film, however, that the Travel Channel reveals that \u201ccertain events in this film are fictional\u201d:\n\nTravel Channel\u2019s disclaimer goes on to say that the \u201creports of Paranormal and Occult Activity in the town are real, and have been cited as a possible reasons for the 1975 evacuation,\u201d and that \u201cconspiracy theorists continue to debate why the U.S. Government evacuated Boston, Ohio.\u201d\n\nWhile this Travel Channel special states that it is based on real \u201creports\u201d and rumors, it also peddles a number of outright falsehoods. For instance, a 16-year-old was not killed by a Wendigo (or a bear) in 2016, authorities did not kill 14 people during a shootout with a cult, and two children did not mysteriously vanish from the area.\n\nThis article is not meant to be a comprehensive list of every misleading detail included in the \u201cHelltown\u201d show. Rather, we\u2019re going to point out how some of the \u201cevidence\u201d was manufactured in order to show that this \u201cdocumentary\u201d is really just a work of fiction.\n\nIn 1974, Congress passed Public Law 93-555, which allowed the federal government to acquire land in order to establish the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. Boston Township in Ohio was one piece of land that was acquired for this project. Shortly after U.S. President Gerald Ford signed this legislation into law, the government started to purchase properties in Boston and forced people to move out of the newly designated national recreation area.\n\nThe Frontline special \u201cFor the Good of All\u201d took a look at how this legislation impacted the local population of Boston:\n\nThe government purchased hundreds of homes with the hopes of turning the area into a national park, but the project quickly fell behind schedule. As houses sat abandoned and vacant for years, urban legends about the area started to grow. Some claimed that the area was haunted, and that the government only purchased the land to cover up some sort of nefarious activity. Similar rumors spread, and soon the area became known as \u201cHelltown.\u201d\n\nAccording to Atlas Obscura, the last of the abandoned buildings of \u201cHelltown\u201d were torn down in 2016.\n\nWhat does the Travel Channel special \u201cHelltown\u201d get wrong?\n\nIt\u2019s true that a number of houses were left abandoned in the 1970s after the government acquired the area of Boston Township in Ohio in 1974 to develop the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. While this historical event serves as the starting point for this show, \u201cHelltown\u201d quickly veers off into the world of fiction.\n\nThe \u201cexperts\u201d in \u201cHelltown\u201d are actors.\n\nFor starters, the main expert in this \u201cHelltown\u201d video is presented as a professor of folklore and mythology at Cuyahoga Community College named Paul Wyndham:\n\nBut this is not a \u201cprofessor of folklore.\u201d This is an actor. We reached out to Cuyahoga Community College and we were told that there was no \u201cPaul Wyndham\u201d on staff. Furthermore, according to a spokesperson for the college, Wyndham doesn\u2019t even pronounce \u201cCuyahoga\u201d correctly in the film.\n\nThis character is being played by actor Dave Evans, who apparently has a penchant for playing \u201cexperts\u201d in pseudo-science documentaries. In 2012, he played \u201cDr. Paul Robertson, former NOAA scientist,\u201d in Animal Planet\u2019s pseudo-documentary \u201cMermaids: The Body Found.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelltown\u201d presents a number of other characters as if they were \u201clocals\u201d from the area. Again, however, these are just actors. The most misleading use of an actor comes from the \u201carchival\u201d footage that was supposedly unearthed during the making of this mockumentary. While conspiracy theorist Terry Greenbaum (played by actor Darren White) presents this footage as if it were taken in 1975 \u2014 the footage is preceded by a title card reading \u201cThe following is an edited version of the raw 16mm footage recovered from Jack Writer\u2019s Camera Magazine, Filmed in 1975\u201d \u2014 it actually features modern footage of actor Michael Lipka.\n\nA 16-year-old was not eaten by a Wendigo (or a bear) in 2016.\n\nOne outlandish claim in the movie is that a teenager was killed by a \u201cWendigo,\u201d a mythological man-eating creature, in 2016. In addition to claiming that a teenager was killed, \u201cHelltown\u201d also claims that authorities covered up the truth about the mythical man-eater by blaming a bear for the teen\u2019s death.\n\nWhile this anecdote is presented in the form of a news report, this is just another staged production. This section (which appears around the 10-minute mark) features a fictional police official named Capt. Marie Hutchinson and stock footage of a deceased bear. There is also not a \u201cWBOH News\u201d channel in Ohio.\n\nWe were unable to find any credible reports about a 16-year-old who was killed by a bear (or a Wendigo) in Cuyahoga National Forest in 2016. It appears that this rumor was made up out of whole cloth.\n\nTwo children did not disappear in \u201cHelltown.\u201d\n\nAt one point in this \u201cdocumentary,\u201d the filmmakers blame the disappearance of two children from Boston Township on a local cult. As evidence, they show what appears at first glance to be a newspaper clipping:\n\nThis image, however, doesn\u2019t feature two children who went missing in Boston Township. Both of these images were taken from modern stock photographs:\n\nA shootout at a cult compound did not result in 14 deaths.\n\nA second fake newspaper clipping is also featured in the \u201cHelltown\u201d movie. This time, a doctored newspaper clipping is used to push the false claim that 14 people were killed in a shootout between authorities and the \u201cWW Cult.\u201d\n\nThis is not a genuine newspaper, and the featured photograph does not show the \u201ccompound headquarters\u201d of the WW Cult. This image actually shows a rural farm in the Czech Republic.\n\nIn sum, the federal government in 1974 started to acquire land in Ohio to develop the Cuyahoga National Recreation Area, an actual place. This forced the residents of Boston Township to move, leaving a number of homes and buildings vacant, which eventually led to rumors about paranormal and occult activity in the area.\n\nWhile some people may truly believe that the area of \u201cHelltown\u201d is haunted, the majority of anecdotes included in this Travel Channel special are completely scripted fabrications being re-told by actors. A 16-year-old was not eaten by a Wendigo, two children did not mysteriously disappear, and authorities did not kill 14 people during a shootout. These incidents, as stated in the disclaimer at the close of this Travel Channel special, are completely \u201cfictional.\u201d We therefore rate the claim of strange happenings in this town as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
