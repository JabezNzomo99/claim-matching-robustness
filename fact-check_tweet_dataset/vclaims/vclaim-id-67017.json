Still they say student cannot decide their welfare. #ProtestAgainstExamsInCOVID,\" the tweet reads. At the time of writing this report, the tweet was shared over 3,000 times.\n\nAccording to the screenshot, the report was published on August 20. \"COMDEK UGET 2020: 57 deaths With 5371 students tested +ve for Covid 19, 8456 students qurantined,\" reads the title of the report. \"Students appeared for the COMDEK many been tested positive for covid 19 with 57 grandparents and parents deaths students onfire,\" reads the subheading. No such report was found on the News 18 website or by other news outlets. Also, the screenshot is rife with grammatical errors. The exam mentioned in the report reads ' COMDEK', however, the actual abbreviation is COMEDK UGET. The abbreviation stands for Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka Under Graduate Entrance Test. Further, the word 'quarantined' is misspelt as 'qurantined'.\n\nIn this screenshot, the headline reads, \"60 \u0421OVID-19 Positive Among 1.47 Lakh Students Who Appeared For CET in Karnataka\". \"Sixty COVID-19 positive students were among the 1.47 lakh who appeared for the Karnataka Common Entrance Test for engineering and other courses which began on Thursday,\" reads the subheading. The article with the same headline was published by NDTV on July 31. The report talks about the Karnataka Common Entrance Test (CET) which began on July 30. The report is not related to the COMEDK examinations which were conducted on August 19. Below is a comparison of the screenshots of the viral (left) and original report (right):\n\nAccording to him, separate sitting arrangements were made for the COVID-19 students and they faced the examination courageously. Therefore, the AISA National Vice-President Ashutosh Kumar shared a fake News18 screenshot and an old NDTV report on the CET exams held back in July. The claims were debunked by AltNews earlier.
