The comments section also showed readers demanding an explanation from the local government of Cavite. Some echoed de Leon\u2019s call for the Chinese flags to be taken down, while others asked when the photos were taken.\n\nThe posts were misleading; the circulating photos were not taken recently.\n\nA keyword search on FB showed that the images -- as well as other captures of the flags taken from other angles -- have been circulating online as early as July last year.\n\nOne of the earliest posts on the Chinese flag display, uploaded on July 27, 2019, shows two people on an aerial work platform affixing Chinese flags on a lamppost. The uploader said in his caption that the photo was taken \u201cin Carmona, Cavite, near Carmona Exit,\u201d and asked what the flags were for.\n\nCharmaine Distor, current officer-in-charge of the Carmona Municipal Information, Tourism, Culture and Arts Office, commented on the post, explaining that the display of the Chinese flags with the Philippine flags was for a signing ceremony of a \u201csisterhood agreement\u201d between the Municipality of Carmona and Jiyang County in China. Distor reiterated this in a private message to VERA Files on June 2.\n\nA livestream video on the town\u2019s official FB page and photos uploaded by Carmona Mayor Roy Loyola confirm that the event did happen on July 29, 2019.\n\nDistor added that Carmona has previously done a similar display of foreign flags with the municipality\u2019s other sister cities such as those from South Korea. She said it is \u201cone of [municipality\u2019s] ways to show [its] hospitality with [its] partner countries.\u201d\n\nSeveral netizens who commented on de Leon\u2019s post suggested Carmona\u2019s display was illegal, citing Section 34 of Republic Act No. 8491, or the \u201cFlag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines,\u201d which states it is prohibited \u201cto display in public any foreign flag, except in embassies and other diplomatic establishments, and in offices of international organizations.\u201d\n\nHowever, the National Historical Commission (NHCP) clarified that the display of a foreign flag in public places is allowed during \u201cevents involving a foreign nation,\u201d as long as it is displayed alongside the Philippine flag.\n\n\u201cPuwede lang po siyang i-display kapag sa mga consulate o kaya po kapag may bisita po -- may state visit o kaya po may mga event po na may kinalaman yung foreign nation (It can be displayed in consulates or when there are visitors -- during a state visit or when there is an event involving a foreign nation),\u201d Juan Paolo Calamlam, officer-in-charge of NHC\u2019s Heraldry Section, said in a phone interview with VERA Files.\n\n\u201cPero hindi po puwedeng maiwan mag-isa \u2018yung foreign flag, kailangan po laging may nauuna po \u2018yung Philippine flag (But it is prohibited that a foreign flag is left alone; the Philippine flag should always precede it),\u201d Calamlam added.\n\nThe revived photo made rounds online just as Chinese nationals in the country once again made the headlines after 90 of them were recently arrested in Bacoor City in Cavite for violating quarantine rules amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe offenders claimed they work for a legal Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) in the country, but failed to present proper travel documents and work permits to the authorities.\n\nSocial media tool CrowdTangle shows that from May 28 to June 2, 22 FB posts carried the controversial photo, accumulating over 1,500 interactions from social media users.\n\nIts earliest revival was by a netizen who uploaded the photo on May 28 and noted in the caption that the image was from a Reddit entry published nine months ago. Its reshares and reposts, however, failed to include this crucial piece of information.\n\nTop traffic generators to the misleading reuploads of the photo are all public FB groups: Online Rambulan, THE FORCE OF SEN. BAM AQUINO, and World Boycott of China Goods.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated to reflect a more recent photo of the road in Carmona, Cavite.\n\n\n\nPepc Paloma, \u201cInstallation of Chinese Flags seen in Carmona, Cavite,\u201d July 28, 2019\n\nPatrick Lopez Revilla, \u201cWelcome to the province of China,\u201d July 27, 2019\n\nMunicipality of Carmona, Cavite, Sisterhood Agreement between Jiyang County, China and Mun.
