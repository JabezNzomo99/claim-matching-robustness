These jobs were focused on making gas furnaces. About 600 jobs \u2014 focused on making fan coils \u2014 will still go to Mexico. Meanwhile, the 700 UTEC workers will also lose their jobs to Mexico, though workers at the plant \u2014 which makes microprocessor-based controls for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration units \u2014 had gotten their hopes up after Trump\u2019s announcement that he had struck a deal with United Technologies.\n\nIn claiming 1,100 jobs, Trump is including 300 jobs that never were going to Mexico in the first place. He also is conveniently forgetting about the 700 jobs from UTEC, though both announcements were made at the same time. Trump tweeted Sunday that he will slap a 35 percent tariff on any company that ships jobs to another country, so it\u2019s unclear whether United Technologies snookered Trump or Trump snookered United Technologies.\n\nIt turns out a similar figure appears to have first appeared in a letter that James Schellinger, the head of the Indiana Economic Development Corp., wrote to Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) in March. Donnelly had said that he had been told Carrier was moving to Mexico because wages were so much lower: \u201cIt\u2019s real clear what this is about. This is about Carrier chasing Mexican wages at $3 an hour, that\u2019s what this is about.\u201d\n\nHowever, CRS says 238 \u201cmajor rules\u201d were published in those three years, which at least is close to the 260 figure. But if you are going to be consistent, apples to apples, and keep the calculations to the three-year period of 2013-2015, there were 15 major rules issued by DOE that affected the HVAC and water-heater industry, out of 238 major rules \u2014 not 53 out of 260.\n\nFinally, 39 of the 100 rules were expected to have either $100 million in annual compliance costs, $100 million in annual benefits, or both. In some cases, the ranges were so large that it was difficult to conclude whether the result was a positive or negative one. But in 14 cases, the lowest estimate of the benefits exceeded the highest estimate of the costs.\n\nThe American Action Forum analysis said that on an annual basis, all DOE rule-makings (proposed and final) from the agency from 2007 to 2015 have imposed more than $9.5 billion in economic costs, compared with generating an estimated $32 billion in benefits. The report questioned a number of DOE\u2019s assumptions in calculating the benefits and noted that many of the costs will be borne directly by the consumer (such as an $83 increase in a refrigerator or $464 more for a water heater), who may or may not own the item long enough to get back the upfront cost through lower energy bills.", "lang": "en"}
