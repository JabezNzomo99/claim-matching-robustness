As we previously stated, this image is real and from the funeral of IRA member Bobby Sands in May 1981. However, the man highlighted in the image is not Mr Corbyn.\n\nThe Bobby Sands Trust told Full Fact that they believe the man is Jim Gibney, then part of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee (a pressure group campaigning for political status for Republican prisoners), and now an aide to Sinn F\u00e9in Senator Niall O\u2019Donnghaile.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this\u2014and find out how to report Facebook content\u2014here. For the purposes of that scheme, we\u2019ve rated this claim as false because this is not an image of Jeremy Corbyn.", "lang": "en"}
