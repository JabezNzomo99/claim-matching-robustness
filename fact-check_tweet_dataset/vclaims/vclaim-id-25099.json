No, that's not true: the story was made up by a \"fauxtire\" site that invents fictional articles for entertainment purposes. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on January 4, 2019 titled \"'Bird Box' Challenge: Man Crashes After Attempting To Drive Blindfolded\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAUSTIN, TX - A 20 year old man is being hospitalized in serious condition after being involved in an automobile accident. According to witnesses, the man was driving while blindfolded. Authorities say the man was attempting the \"Bird Box challenge\", a challenge that consists of attempting every day tasks while blindfolded, in this case driving a car. Jacob, 20, is currently being hospitalized at Austin state hospital after being involved in a serious 4 vehicle accident. All others involved in the accident walked away with minor cuts and bruises. Jacob was attempting to drive his car down 45th street blindfolded thanks to the latest internet challenge called the \"Bird Box challenge\". 'Bird Box' is the title of a recently released Netflix horror film in which characters in the movie must be blindfolded to not be \"possessed\" by the evil spirits, thus the characters had to do everyday activities blindfolded.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe Bird Box challenge was inspired by the Netflix movie \"Bird Box\" in which a mother and her two children must complete a dangerous journey while blindfolded:\n\nThe movie has inspired people to post images and videos on social media in which they try to complete various activities while wearing a blindfold. This caused Netflix to post message to its official Twitter account asking people to be careful because they didn't want anyone to get hurt:\n\nThe car crash story is false though: Huzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nThe image illustrating the story was not even taken in Texas but apparently in Singapore:\n\nThis really bad accident happened this morning at about 4.00 am just before Woodlands Checkpoint on the way in to Malaysia. No news yet on the condition of the drivers and their passengers. We are still trying to get information on how it happened. Anybody out there can share the information please.\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Doing 'Bird Box Challenge' Did NOT Get Jumped And Mugged In Hood\n\u2022 Fake News: Man NOT Hospitalized After His Apple Airpods Exploded In His Ear\n\u2022 Fake News: Judge Did NOT Order Premium Snapchat Model to Pay $60k in Taxes to IRS After Multiple Reports by Internet Users\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida's 'Neck Guy' Did NOT Undergo Plastic Surgery To Decrease Neck Size\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Beat Little Brother After He Found Him Masturbating During \"No Nut November\"", "lang": "en"}
