It was taken on Oct. 1, 2013, at Tamara Mellon\u2019s \u201cIn My Shoes A Memoir\u201d celebration at the Four Seasons Restaurant in New York City by photographer Leandro Justen.\n\nThis image was widely circulated in November 2019 along with the insinuation that Bloomberg was somehow involved with Epstein\u2019s illicit activities. Maxwell has been accused of procuring young girls for Epstein. As of this writing, however, she has not been charged with any crimes in relation to the Epstein case.\n\nMaxwell is a British socialite who has been photographed with countless public figures, such as actors Julianna Margulies and Kyle Maclachlan, reporters Barbara Walters and Piers Morgan, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton.\n\nBloomberg, too, is a well-known public figure who frequents events with the rich and famous. It isn\u2019t all that surprising that these two would meet at some point during an event in New York City, and certainly isn\u2019t proof that these two were somehow in cahoots to aid Epstein\u2019s criminal activities.\n\nWhile conspiracy theorists may point to this picture and make vague claims attempting to connect Bloomberg to Epstein, the only thing we can really glean is that two public figures were once photographed together at a public event.", "lang": "en"}
