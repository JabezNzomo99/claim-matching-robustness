No, that's not true: This story was a piece of satire published on a liberal website that intentionally sets out to mislead conservative supporters.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by Potatriot's Unite on February 17, 2020. It was titled \"Dearborn Joins California in Canceling President's Day\" (archived here) and opened:\n\n\n\nThe city of Dearborn has once again shown why Sharian Law doesn't work in America. In a show of disrespect, their Moon God-worshipping City Council has decided to cancel President's Day. The move follows a similar stunt by the California legislature. According to the official register, Dearborn citizens supported the measure by a margin of 72 percent. Coincidentally, Dearborn's Muslammical population is near 72 percent.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe fictional story about Dearborn featured quotes from made-up characters, including \"Arturi al Tubolsi, spokesman for the Dearborn Chamber of Commerce,\" a play on the nom de plume of the head satirical network of websites, Christopher Blair.\n\nin the story, Tubolsi supposedly had this to say to critics:\n\nAlso, the link in the first paragraph of the story takes readers to another satirical piece about California supposedly canceling President's Day. It never happened in either case.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by Blair, a self-professed liberal troll from Maine, along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact-checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact-checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this, he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry visible disclaimers.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites that often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nThis made-up story about Dearborn, for example, was picked up and shared -- without the satire disclaimer -- on a blog called \"Fresno press.\"\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer, it is, of course, also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes potatriotsunite.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
