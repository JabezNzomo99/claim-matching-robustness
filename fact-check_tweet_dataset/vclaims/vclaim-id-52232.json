Against the background of an ongoing controversy over the decision by some players and staff to protest against racial injustice during the playing of the national anthem, one notorious junk news web site sought to make hay, publishing no fewer than seven entirely false protest-related stories that day.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense posted fabricated stories which claimed that: the Federal Communications Commission had fined the NFL because Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 wide receiver Antonio Brown had knelt during the anthem; that white and black Buffalo Bills players had had a locker room brawl over the anthem protests; that a fictional black Pittsburgh Steelers player named \u201cJude Black\u201d (described in the article as a \u201ckneeling thug\u201d) had attacked a referee after receiving a penalty for protesting during the national anthem; that New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichek had fined another fictional black player (\u201cTyrone Blackman\u201c) for kneeling; that Patriots owner Robert Kraft had personally walked onto the field of play and fired two of his players for not standing during the anthem; and that the Dallas Cowboys had demoted players who kneeled during the anthem the previous week.\n\nHowever, the article which prompted the most queries from our readers and was the most shared on Facebook was one that claimed Denver Broncos general manager John Elway had walked on to the field before the team\u2019s game against the Baltimore Ravens and personally fired three players who disobeyed an order not to kneel during the anthem.\n\nUnder the headline \u201cBREAKING: Broncos VP John Elway Storms Field, Fires 3 Kneeling Players on the Spot,\u201d the article stated:\n\nAccording to sources inside the locker room, The Denver Broncos were brought together for a \u201cpolicy meeting\u201d on Wednesday of last week with none other than legendary quarterback John Elway. Elway, now VP of Football Operations for the franchise, made his decision on the subject very clear. \u201cThere will be no kneeling during the national anthem in this stadium. I don\u2019t care what your beliefs aree [sic]. You\u2019re at work and your antics are costing us money. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d Elway took the politics out of it and went right for what counts: the money. After giving them the choice, three players have stated all week that they will kneel regardless of the consequences. Mavius Malphner said he\u2019ll follow in the footsteps of his \u201ccurrent hero,\u201d Colin Kaepernick: \u201cDo what you believe, right? Kap has the idea. I\u2019ll do what I want. What are they gonna do, fire me?\u201d Unfortunately for Malphner and two other teammates, Ladamian Brown and DeShaq Darq, Elway was waiting just inside the tunnel for the anthem to start. When he saw the players kneeling, he made his way across the field. Commentator Troy Aikman called the action: \u201cIt looks like Elway is headed directly towards the kneeling\u2026oh\u2026he just gave them the ejection signal. I think he just fired those three players for standing up for what they believe in. Wow. That is not the John Elway I know.\u201d\n\nNone of these events took place. The Broncos have no players named Mavius Malphner, Ladamian Brown, or DeShaq Darq. Like everything published by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, the article is fake.\n\nHowever, some readers mistakenly believed it to be authentic, as demonstrated by the many earnest comments on the Facebook page of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense.\n\nThat Facebook page and website (currently operating at the URL \u201ctrumpbetrayed.us\u201d) are part of a network of junk news sites that engage in political trolling, much of it racially-charged and inflammatory, presented as \u201csatire.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
