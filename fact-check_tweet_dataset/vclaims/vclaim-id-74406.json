The fighter jets took off from France on July 27 and made a halt in the UAE.\n\n\n\nIn the backdrop of this, a video of jets forming a tricolour display as they fly away is being circulated with the claim that this shows France bidding farewell to the Rafales heading for India.\n\n\"Everyone talked about Rafales landing in India but see the farewell from France with Indian Tricolors. Will surely make you miss several heart beats!!\" reads the message accompanying the viral video. The claim has been shared multiple times on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nViral video showing jet fly off with a display of the tricolour is from the farewell event hosted by France for the Rafale jets heading to India. A Google Reverse Image search was done by breaking the video into individual frames using InVid. This clearly showed that the video was from Italy's Republic Day celebrations in Rome.\n\nAccording to a report from 2015, which carried a screengrab from the viral video, June 2 marks the day when Italians used their votes to depose their monarchy once and for all in 1946.\n\nReportedly, the Air Force acrobatics team known as the Frecce Tricolori (Italian for \"three-colored arrows\") flies in formation over the capital of the country, Rome, leaving smoke trails in the colours of the Italian flag: green, white, and red.\n\n\n\nThe similarity of the Italian flag colours and the Indian tricolour is being used to propagate the fake claim along with the viral video. In fact, the Italian flag can be clearly seen in the viral video.
