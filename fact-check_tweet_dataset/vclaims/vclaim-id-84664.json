This video has been shared in a misleading context; it actually shows a plane in Nairobi, Kenya carrying aid for Guangzhou.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on February 9, 2020. It has been viewed over 1,500 times.\n\nThe 15-second video shows a plane\u2019s cabin filled with boxes. It is overlaid with a popular Chinese patriotic song, \u201cMy Motherland and Me\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s simplified Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201c#GodBlessChina / This is a China Southern Airlines flight from Melbourne to Guangzhou with no passengers. Chinese Australians bought the tickets and put all these relief materials they selflessly donated on their seats. Almost all the masks have been sent to China by Chinese people overseas for emergency.\u201d\n\nThe fight against novel coronavirus continues as China announced a dramatically spiked death toll of 1,355 on February 13, 2020. The total number of nationwide infections has risen to almost 60,000. Here is an AFP report on the ongoing epidemic.\n\nThe video has also been shared here, here and here on Facebook, here and here on Twitter and here, here and here on Youtube, alongside a similar claim.\n\nIt was also shared by the Chinese diplomat Zhao Lijian here on Twitter. Below is a screenshot of his tweet:\n\nHowever, this video has been shared in a misleading context. It actually shows a China Southern Airlines plane in Nairobi carrying medical supplies collected by the Chinese diaspora and bound for Guangzhou. Passengers who bought tickets for this flight were upgraded by the airline to make space for the aid boxes in the cabin.\n\nAFP found this higher quality version of the video, which shows two legible labels on some of the boxes, on the Weibo account of Beijing News.\n\nThe simplified Chinese label on one of the boxes seen at the eight-second mark of the video reads: \"Jiangsu Province Overseas Chinese Charity Foundation\".\n\nAnother box seen at the 11-second mark is labelled \"Jiangsu Charity Federation\".\n\nFurther searches on the official website of the Jiangsu Province Overseas Chinese Charity Foundation led to this press release dated February 8, 2020.\n\nThe headline states: \u201cNearly 270,000 face masks donated by Kenya Jiangsu Business Association arrived safe and sound\".\n\nThe article reads, in part: \u201cAt the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya, boxes of masks were neatly stacked in the cargo of China Southern Airlines flight CZ634 heading from Nairobi to Guangzhou. The Chinese community in Kenya fought hard to gather these protective materials for the mother country in the wake of the epidemic. The love is so great that even the cargo could not fit it all in.\n\n\u201cRegarding the situation, China Southern Airlines promptly and decisively launched an emergency plan, upgrading all passengers free of charge and freeing up the cabin area for the loveful materials from Chinese people in Kenya. Upon landing, Nanjing customs, Jiangsu Charity Federation and Jiangsu Province Overseas Chinese Charity Foundation provided the quickest and most efficient way for the transferring of the donation.\"\n\nAFP also found this February 7, 2020 article published on the website of the Jiangsu Charity Federation, which mentions aid from Kenya.\n\nThe article states, in part: \u201cIn a race against time and disease, Jiangsu Charity Federation resolutely implemented President Xi's instruction of \u2018all donated materials shall be used for timely epidemic prevention and control\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Jiangsu Province Overseas Chinese Charity Foundation organised for the Kenya Jiangsu Business Association and Jiangsu Clansmen Association to donate 270,000 masks to Jiangsu Charity Federation.\u201d\n\nThe article also features a photo of the plane cabin filled with boxes of humanitarian aid, partially labelled \"Jiangsu Charity Federation\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:", "lang": "en"}
