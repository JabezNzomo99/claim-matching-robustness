( here ), It earmarks about $500 billion in direct payments to Americans in two waves of checks of up to $1,200 for an individual earning up to $75,000 a year. Additional payments for families with children could push the total to $3,000 for a family of four, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ( here ).\n\nIt is true that the 2020 U.S. census count is now underway ( 2020census.gov/ ), with Census Day coming up on April 1 ( here ). Respondents can fill out the form online, by phone, or by mail. The purpose of the census, which aims to count every person living in the U.S. and five U.S. territories, is to provide \u201ccritical data that lawmakers, business owners, teachers, and many others use to provide daily services, products, and support\u201d in different communities, according to the Census Bureau ( here ). Census data informs how billions of dollars in federal funding are allocated to hospitals, fire departments, schools, infrastructure and other resources. The census count also determines how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives, and it is used to map congressional and state legislative districts.\n\nThe stimulus package in response to the coronavirus pandemic is not related to the federal census. In response to rumors circulating online, the Census Bureau clarified the matter here on its website. Under the heading \u201cWill filling out the 2020 Census impact whether you receive a stimulus check?\u201d the site says, \u201cNo. Your answers cannot be used to impact your eligibility for any government benefits, including any potential stimulus package. The Census Bureau is bound by Title 13 of the U.S. Code to keep your information confidential, and the answers you provide are used only to produce statistics.\u201d\n\nThe census count will continue through July 2020, and the Census Bureau will not deliver apportionment (the division of the seats in the House of Representatives among the 50 states) counts to the President and Congress until December 2020 ( here ).\n\nDirect payments to families as part of the stimulus package will likely happen sooner. During a March 17 coronavirus task force briefing, Secretary Mnuchin said \u201cAmericans need cash now, and the President wants to get cash now. And I mean now, in the next two weeks.\u201d (see 18:42 here ). According to NBC, the Treasury Department proposed that \u201ctwo rounds of direct payments to taxpayers, each totaling $250 billion\u2026 be sent on April 6 and on May 18.\u201d ( here )\n\nFalse: the eligibility of Americans for federal checks amidst the coronavirus outbreak is not subject to completion of the census\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
