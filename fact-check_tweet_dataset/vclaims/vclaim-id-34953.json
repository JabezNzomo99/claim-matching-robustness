Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of the juvenile convicted in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case. Fact: The man in the photo is Vinay Sharma, one of the adult convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case. He is not the juvenile convicted in the case. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the posted image is cropped and run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo can be found in an article published by the \u2018Hindustan Times\u2019 in August 2016. In the article, it can be read that the man in the photo is Vinay Sharma, one of the adult convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case. He is not the juvenile convicted in the case.\n\n\n\nA similar photo (archived) from another angle is also being shared on social media with the same claim. The man in that photo is also Vinay Sharma.\n\nIn an article by \u2018The Hindu\u2019, it can be read that the juvenile convict had been \u201creleased to a non-governmental organisation on December 20, 2015. He had been then moved to an undisclosed location, reportedly near his village in Uttar Pradesh.\u201d In an \u2018India Today\u2019 article, it was found that Vinay Sharma has been shifted to Tihar Jail from Mandauli on Sunday (December 8, 2019).\n\nTo sum it up, the man in the photo is not the juvenile convict but an adult convict (Vinay Sharma) in the Nirbhaya case.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
