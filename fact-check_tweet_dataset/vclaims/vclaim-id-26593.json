It is possible to register to vote at two addresses if, for example, you are a student with different home and term-time addresses.\n\nIn a general election , you can only vote in one of the places where you are registered to vote. As that is one election, you are only allowed one vote. But, as the post correctly says, you can choose which of the two areas to vote in, and can make that decision on election day.\n\nIn local elections you are allowed to vote in both areas\u2014provided they are not in the same local authority\u2014because each local authority vote is counted as a separate election.", "lang": "en"}
