The claim is false; the ballots that can be seen in the misleading videos are missing a key security feature included on all official ballots.\n\n\n\nOne of the videos, which was shared here on YouTube and has been viewed more than 40,000 times since it was uploaded April 30, 2019, shows what it claims is an official ballot for the midterm elections on May 13.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video:\n\nThe yellow text, when translated to English, says \u201cThis is the official ballot which came from Comelec\u201d.\n\n\u201cComelec\u201d refers to the Commission on Elections, the government body which oversees Philippine elections.\n\nThe misleading video claims that the purported ballot has been doctored so that the names of opposition candidates have been pre-selected.\n\nA similar video and claim have also been posted on Facebook here, where it has been shared more than 54,000 times and viewed nearly 900,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe misleading Facebook post also features a purported ballot for the May 13, 2019 election.\n\nThe misleading Facebook video also claims that the purported ballot has been doctored so that the names of opposition candidates have been pre-selected.\n\nA man can be heard in the video saying in Tagalog from 0:02-0:13: \u201cI will just expose this, this shameless Comelec, they have no shame, why will we even have the elections when this is already the case?\u201d\n\nHe adds from 0:46 - 0:49: \u201cThe ballots have been printed, they are already printed\u201d.\n\nBut neither of the misleading videos show an official ballot paper for the Philippine election.\n\nBoth of the purported ballots in the misleading videos are missing a QR code, which is a security and tracking feature that appears on all official ballots in the May 13 election.\n\n\u201cThe QR code is a security feature. It makes it easier to track the ballot and is specific to the place where the ballot can be used,\u201d James Jimenez, Comelec spokesman, told AFP in a phone interview on May 7.\n\nComelec Executive Director Jose Tolentino told reporters on May 2 that the misleading videos did not show genuine ballots.\n\nHis comments can be seen at the 9:43 mark in this footage, uploaded on Comelec\u2019s official Facebook page.\n\n\u201cObviously, the video was staged because the ballot that was used did not have the QR code,\u201d Tolentino says in the video.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the purported ballot from the YouTube video (top image) and the dummy ballot Comelec provided to AFP via email on May 9 (bottom image):\n\nComelec says it has not released real ballots in order to avoid potential fraud. However, the body posted sample ballots -- without QR codes -- on its website in February.\n\nThe purported official ballots in the misleading videos say: \u201cAPLAYA, SANTA ROSA CITY, LAGUNA\u201d on the right and have the number \u201c0014A\u201d on the left.\n\nA sample ballot which contains the exact same information can be seen here on the Comelec website.", "lang": "en"}
