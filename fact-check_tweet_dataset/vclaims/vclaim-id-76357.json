Republicans argue photo IDs are necessary to safeguard the voting process from fraud, while Democrats warn that legislation would disenfranchise minority and poor voters.\n\nThe survey Rowden cited put the question this way: \"The legislature is proposing to require voters to show a valid Missouri driver\u2019s license or other valid identification in order to vote. Do you agree or disagree with this?\"\n\nThe hitch is that the poll does not clarify what \"other valid identification\" entails. Defining what does and does not constitute \"valid identification\" is the crux of a proposed Missouri bill.\n\nAs Missouri law stands now, any form of ID issued by Missouri, the federal government or another state is accepted as proof of identity to vote. Those forms include driver\u2019s licenses from another state, birth certificates, student IDs, utility bills and bank statements. Not all of those include a photo.\n\n\"To a lot of people, it\u2019s just common-sense rhetoric that you need a photo ID to do lots of things in life, including voting,\" he said. \"But if the wording laid out more exact points, such as the fact that the proposed legislation doesn\u2019t include student IDs or out-of-state licenses, you might get a different response.\"\n\nA poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports this summer illustrated a similar trend, showing more than three-quarters of Americans are in favor of requiring a photo ID to vote. That poll asked, \"Should voters be required to show photo identification such as a driver\u2019s license before being allowed to vote?\"\n\n\"As a rule, we just try to keep the questioning as simple as possible,\" she said. \"The important thing is not to influence the responses with the wording of the question.\"\n\nEven those who disagree with the idea of requiring photo identification don\u2019t dispute that surveys show a high level of support for the idea. Missouri\u2019s League of Women Voters\u2019 Voter Protection and Service Director Kathleen Farrell said people might not know the details of the legislation that surveys ask about.\n\n\"The average person might not know just how strict Missouri\u2019s proposed legislation is,\" she said. \"They also may not know how expensive it could be to require photo ID for all voters.\"\n\nThe bill\u2019s fiscal note allows for up to about $10.7 million dollars of funding; if the necessary funds were not allocated, the requirements for photo identification to vote would not be implemented.\n\nRowden\u2019s statement that \"70 percent of Missourians support voter photo ID identification\" isn\u2019t fully supported by the poll he provided. The poll Rowden cited only asks about \"requiring Missouri driver\u2019s licenses or other valid form of ID to vote.\" It doesn\u2019t specify that the proposed legislation restricts valid identification to IDs that have photos.", "lang": "en"}
