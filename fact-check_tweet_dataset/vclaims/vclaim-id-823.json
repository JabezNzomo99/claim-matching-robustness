The soldiers in the original image, which has been circulating since at least 2007, do not have medals on their sleeves or their pants:\n\nWe found no official photographs of North Korean generals wearing military accolades on their pants. A photograph from 1995, however, shows a group of soldiers covered in a similar number of awards:\n\nThese images are frequently circulated along with the insinuation that the pictured soldiers do not deserve the medals they\u2019re displaying, because the North Korean military has not seen combat for decades. However (putting aside that military medals are usually made out of gold, silver, or brass, which are non-magnetic materials), military medals are frequently awarded for non-combat accomplishments.", "lang": "en"}
