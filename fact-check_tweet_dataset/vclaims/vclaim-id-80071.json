The purported article says that an opposition candidate in May 2019 midterm elections has pledged to send people to jail for mocking her. The claim is false; the image in the posts is a doctored version of a real news report.\n\nThe posts, for example this one published to Facebook April 13, 2019, and shared more than 300 times since, contain a purported screenshot of a report from national news site Inquirer.net about the politician Samira Gutoc.\n\nGutoc is running for the upper house of the Philippine Congress in May 13 elections. Here is the candidate list on the government website, in which Gutoc is number 36, and here is a campaign video featuring her and other opposition candidates.\n\nThe image in the false post features a photo of Gutoc and a headline that says: \u201cGutoc to netizens: I\u2019ll send you to jail for making fun of wearing my life vest!\u201d\n\nThe same image has been shared elsewhere on Facebook, for example here and here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:\n\nOn April 8, 2019, Gutoc and other opposition candidates tried to sail to Scarborough Shoal, a disputed territory in the South China Sea which has been under Chinese control since 2012. \n\n\n\nHere is an information page on the Scarborough Shoal on the website of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, here is a Facebook post by the group of politicians about their attempt and here is a Manila Bulletin report about the stunt.\n\nPhotos posted online of the trip for example here on Twitter showed Gutoc wearing a life jacket backwards. Some social media users mocked her for this.\n\nFor example, the caption of this Facebook post, translated to English, says: \u201cBecause Samira Gutoc is so brave, she will charge towards China even if her life vest is worn backwards. GIVE HER A JACKET!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that post, which is dated April 12, 2019:\n\nGutoc defended herself on April 12 in the Facebook post embedded below.\n\nTranslated to English, its caption says: \u201cI may have worn my life vest the wrong way, but my stance is not wrong. What is hard is when you\u2019re wearing it the right way, but you have already sold your soul, heart and mind to China\u201d.\n\nHer comments were reported by news organisations including in this article published on Inquirer.net, also on April 12.\n\nThe headline of the Inquirer.net article says: \u201cGutoc slams critics: Wearing life vest wrong better than having wrong principles\u201d\n\nHere is a comparison image showing the misleading post on the left and the genuine article from Inquirer.net on the right:\n\nThe two screenshots have key similarities, including the Inquirer logo and the reporter\u2019s byline.\n\nHowever the genuine article is timestamped April 12 at 2:08 pm \u2013 before the date of April 13 given in both the misleading image and the Facebook post that shared it.\n\nThere is no indication in the original Inquirer.net article that it was updated at a later date.\n\nInquirer.net said the misleading post \u201cis not real\u201d.\n\n\u201cAn article allegedly published by Inquirer.net, under the byline of reporter Gabriel Pabico Lalu, which claims senatorial candidate Samira Gutoc has threatened to jail her critics is not real,\u201d the site said in a statement here.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook, embedded below, Gutoc also denied having said the quote in the misleading post's headline:\n\nHer post, when translated to English, says: \u201cFAKE NEWS ALERT!!! This is not like me at all, hahaha. There are really just dishonest people who spread fake news. And there are liars who should not be voted into the Senate.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
