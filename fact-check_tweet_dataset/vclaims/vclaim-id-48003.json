Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Aurelius ever said or wrote this saying.\n\nAurelius, who ruled Rome as emperor from 161 to 180 A.D., was a proponent and practitioner of Stoicism, a philosophy that emphasizes a rational, pragmatic approach to life. He even wrote a series of 12 books, eventually compiled and titled \u201cMeditations,\u201d in which he outlined his personal Stoic philosophy.\n\nHowever, nowhere in this work, or any of Aurelius\u2019s other writings, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. It appears to be apocryphal.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fake quote,\u201d said Donald Robertson, author of \u201cHow to Think Like a Roman Emperor: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius,\u201d in an email to the DCNF.\n\nStephen Hanselman, author of \u201cThe Daily Stoic,\u201d pointed out that it resembles other statements found in \u201cMeditations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very loose expansion of what Marcus wrote in The Meditations 4.3 where he says: \u2018our disturbances come only from our own opinions \u2026 everything that we see will change and no longer exist \u2026 the universe is change and life is opinion,'\u201d said Hanselman in an email to the DCNF. \u201cThis layering on of \u2018alternative facts and truths\u2019 is a current obsession, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\nBecause Aurelius\u2019s work was originally written in the Koine Greek, the wording of the lines that Hanselman references in his email often depends on which translation of \u201cMeditations\u201d is being consulted. It\u2019s likely the quote originated as an attempted translation or paraphrase from a passage in \u201cMeditations\u201d that was then confused as a direct quote from Aurelius.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
