These posts portray the media and Harris as being inconsistent in describing her racial identity by switching from \u201cIndian-American\u201d to \u201cBlack.\u201d\n\nExamples of these posts can be found here , here , and here .\n\nKamala Harris is the first Black woman and Asian-American on a major presidential ticket in the U.S. She is the daughter to late Shyamala Gopalan, who was Indian-American, and Donald Harris, who is Jamaican-American. Images of Harris with her parents can be found here .\n\nDonald Harris, emigrated to the United States from Jamaica in 1964 to pursue a doctorate degree in economics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley ( here ). He is a former economics professor at Stanford University ( here ) and can be seen here (rb.gy/mzak7e) speaking at a conference on global economic imbalances at American University in 1989.\n\nJamaica\u2019s population mostly consists of those descended from enslaved Africans, brought by the British to work the island\u2019s sugar estates, particularly during the 18th century ( here). As of 2012, 90% of Jamaicans were of African origin ( here ).\n\nShyamala Gopalan, who was Tamil Indian-American, graduated from the University of Delhi and then received a PhD in nutrition and endocrinology from UC Berkeley ( here ). She became a cancer researcher at Berkeley, and then at the University of Illinois and the University of Wisconsin. Gopalan died in 2009 ( here ).\n\nSenator Harris has long identified as both Black and Indian. She recognizes both parents\u2019 heritage as part of her identity and her senate bio reads that she is \u201cthe second African-American woman and first South Asian-American senator in history\u201d ( www.harris.senate.gov/about ).\n\nHarris details her mixed-race identity and upbringing in her 2019 memoir \u201cThe Truths We Hold\u201d ( here ), describing how she and her younger sister Maya \u201cwere raised with a strong awareness of and appreciation for Indian culture,\u201d while her mother also \u201cunderstood very well that she was raising two black daughters\u201d and \u201cwas determined to make sure (they) would grow into confident, proud black women.\u201d\n\nThe posts on Facebook juxtapose two headlines from the Associated Press, one from 2016 calling her \u201cIndian-American\u201d and one from 2020 calling her \u201cBlack.\u201d Throughout her political career, the media has used many terms, including Black, South Asian, and African American, to describe Harris.\n\nIn 2010, when she became Attorney General of California, for example, the New York Times described her as \u201cthe daughter of a black economist and an Indian biologist\u201d ( here ).\n\nSix years later, when she was elected senator, the Times referred to her as \u201cthe first black woman elected to represent the state in the United States Senate,\u201d noting that \u201cMs. Harris\u2019s mother was born in India\u2026 while her father grew up in Jamaica\u201d ( here ).\n\nDuring her 2019 campaign for president, the Los Angeles Times published a story about Harris\u2019s \u201cprogressive Indian grandfather,\u201d P.V. Gopalan, who reportedly used his retirement savings to pay for his daughter Shyamala\u2019s tuition at Berkeley ( here ). At Berkeley, the L.A. Times reported, Shyamala \u201cjoined the black civil rights movement, where she met a brilliant Jamaican economics student named Donald Harris.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ABC News described her as \u201cboth black and Indian American\u201d in 2019 ( here ) and The New Yorker called her \u201cthe second (Black woman elected to the Senate) and also the first South Asian senator\u201d that same year ( here ) .\n\nSince becoming Biden\u2019s vice-presidential pick for 2020, Harris has been described by news outlets as \u201cBlack and South Asian\u201d ( here ), \u201cthe first Black woman and Asian American to join a major-party U.S. presidential ticket\u201d ( here ), and as \u201cBlack, Asian, American\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team previously cleared up misleading posts on Facebook claiming to show Harris with her parents here . Reuters also fact-checked claims that an image of Kamala Harris\u2019s birth certificate identified her as \u201cCaucasian\u201d ( here ).\n\nFurther reading on Kamala and her identity here , here and here.\n\nPartly false. While these headlines are true, the press, as well as Kamala Harris herself, have continually described her racial identity as Black, South Asian, Indian-American, African-American, and Jamaican-American.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
