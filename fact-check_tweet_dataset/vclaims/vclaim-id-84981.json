Share this post so much that each Hindu receives it. Press the thumb emoticon to like this page\u201d). Other pro-Hindutva pages like \u2018Fauji Bhai Rambhakt\u2019 and \u2018Mera Bharat Mahan\u2019 too have posted this photograph. Slogans like \u201cJaago Hindu Jaago\u201d (Wake up Hindus), \u201cPakistan Murdabad \u201c(Death to Pakistan) and \u201cDekhiye Pakistan ki Haqiqat\u201d (Look at the reality of Pakistan) were added while circulating these images.\n\nAlt News fact checked the photograph and found that it is from Gaza in Palestine. The photograph which was taken in November 2012 shows a Palestinian dragging a dead body of a man on a motor cycle. The dead man was one of the six men who were shot by masked men in a city square for supporting Israel. Hamas, the militant Palestinian group took responsibility for the killing. In the same month Israel bombed Gaza in an operation known as \u2018Pillar of Defence\u2019.\n\nIt is clear that the photograph is not from Pakistan, nor is it of any Muslim organisation or people of the Muslim community acting against Hindus. This five year old picture from Palestine is being forwarded on multiple right-wing Facebook pages with the intention of spreading and reinforcing prejudice and hate among communities.
