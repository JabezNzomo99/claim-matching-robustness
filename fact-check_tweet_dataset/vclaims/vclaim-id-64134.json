No, that's not true: The words \"Under God\" were included in the Pledge of Allegiance in nightly prime time events of the Democratic National Convention each of the four nights.\n\nThe claim originated in a post published on Facebook on August 20, 2020 (archived here), with following text:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nEach of these four embedded videos has been cued to begin playing at the point in the program when the Pledge of Allegiance is recited.\n\nMonday, August 17, 2020 -- The first night of the convention:\n\nTuesday, August 18, 2020 -- The second night of the convention:\n\nWednesday, August 19, 2020 -- The third night of the convention:\n\nThursday, August 21, 2020 -- The fourth and final night of the convention:\n\nThere have been other posts on social media that called attention to the omission of the words \"under God\" from the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in two of the nearly 30 caucuses and councils meeting during the convention, the Muslim Delegates Assembly and the LGBTQ caucuses. David Brody, the chief political analyst for the Christian Broadcasting Network called attention to this in two tweets which included video:\n\nThe Pledge of Allegiance did not always contain the words \"under God;\" those words were not added until President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed it into law on June 14, 1954, 62 years after the pledge was first written by Francis J. Bellamy, in 1892. Over time, the Pledge of Allegiance had some changes to the words, as well as some major changes to how Americans are expected to salute the flag.\n\nA nonpartisan review of the history of the changes to the Pledge of Allegiance and U.S. flag code is offered by Encyclopaedia Britannica's ProCon.org (here)(archived here).", "lang": "en"}
