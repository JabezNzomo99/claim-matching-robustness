It makes a number of claims about what has happened after \u201c9 years of a Tory Government\u201d.\n\nOf the eight claims, three are flatly wrong\u2014the ones about child poverty, crime, and public sector pay. The other five claims are accurate, although some could benefit from additional context.\n\nThis article takes a look at each of the claims in turn, looking at the records of the coalition government from 2010-2015 and the Conservatives alone since then. Some of the figures seem to refer to the whole of the UK, while others focus on England and Wales, we\u2019ve indicated where that is the case.\n\nThere are a number of ways to measure child poverty, but none of them show an increase of close to 50% since 2010.\n\nThe Social Metrics Commission, an independent group of experts on poverty, estimates that the number of UK children in poverty in 2017/18 is down by 2%, compared to 2009/10. The percentage of children in poverty is also down by two percentage points.\n\nIn addition, two standard measures of poverty used by government are the number of children living in a household in relative or absolute poverty (you can read more about how those measures are calculated here).\n\nThe number of children living in relative poverty in the UK in 2017/18 is up 5%, compared to 2009/10 (the last year before the Coalition government came into office). The percentage of children in relative poverty is the same now as it was in 2009/10.\n\nThe number of children living in absolute poverty is down 3%, and the percentage of children is down two percentage points.\n\nThese estimates all account for the housing costs of a household. But separate figures measure poverty before you factor that in. If you look at relative poverty, before housing costs, then the increase in child poverty between 2010/11 (rather than 2009/10) and 2017/18 is 30%. That\u2019s the biggest increase we can see in the data in relation to this claim.\n\nWe did find a May 2018 article from the Independent stating: \u201cNumber of children growing up in poverty\u2026 up almost 50 per cent since 2010.\u201d This is inaccurate as the research it is reporting on refers to children in working households growing up in poverty\u2014not all children in poverty.\n\nIn 2018/19, the Trussell Trust\u2014a UK-wide network of food banks\u2014gave out almost 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in crisis.\n\nIn 2009/10 it gave out almost 41,000 three-day packages, and in 2010/11 it gave out 61,000 supplies. Looking at either year, the increase is well over 1,000% to 2018/19. This is the number of individual three-day packages given out, not the number of people using Trussell Trust food banks altogether.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know exactly how much this reflects increased need for emergency food supplies, and we\u2019ve looked at this debate in more detail before. It\u2019s also important to note that the Trussell Trust is not the only food bank network in the UK, so this isn\u2019t a complete picture of food bank use.\n\nThis most likely refers to the number of people who are sleeping rough in England (which isn\u2019t the same as overall homelessness). Rough sleeping increased by 165% from 2010 to 2018 (we don\u2019t have data for earlier than that).\n\nHowever, we shouldn\u2019t treat these statistics as definitive. The figures are estimated by councils in autumn each year, and largely involve counting the number of people sleeping rough on the streets on a single night. These estimates are known to undercount total rough sleeping and separate estimates for London, which are taken over the course of the year, show a higher number of rough sleepers than the government data.\n\nAdditionally, rough sleepers are a minority of all people who are officially defined as homeless in the UK. In many cases \u201chomeless\u201d refers to households that are threatened with the loss of, or unable to continue with, their current accommodation. Around 57,000 households in England were defined as homeless and owed a legal duty to be rehoused in 2017/18\u2014an increase of 41% compared to 2009/10.\n\nIn May 2019 there were almost 4.4 million referrals for treatment on the NHS in England, where the treatment had not yet begun. These \u201cincomplete\u201d treatments are often referred to as the \u201cwaiting list\u201d, and it saw an increase of 70% compared to May 2010.\n\nIn the most recent data (comparing July 2010 to July 2019) the increase is 65%.\n\nThere were around 202,000 members of the police workforce in England and Wales in March 2019. That\u2019s a decrease of 17% compared to March 2010.\n\nLooking solely at police officers, the number fell by 14% over the same period\u2014to just over 123,000 in March 2019.\n\nThis excludes some officers and staff like the British Transport Police, special constables, and those on secondments to central services.\n\nCrime is very difficult to measure accurately, but the weight of evidence suggests that overall crime has fallen since 2010\u2014and certainly not risen by 30%.\n\nOne measure\u2014the total amount of crime recorded by the police in England and Wales\u2014shows a 37% increase in crime between March 2010 and March 2019. But this is not a reliable way of measuring change over time. The figures can\u2019t pick up crime that isn\u2019t reported to the police, which is a particularly problem in cases of domestic violence and sexual offences. They\u2019re also only as good as the police\u2019s own recording practices, which haven\u2019t been consistent over time.\n\nAnother measure is the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on surveys of very large representative samples of the population. This shows that the total number of crime incidents fell by 33% from 2009/10 to 2018/19.\n\nThis data also has its problems\u2014for example it can\u2019t pick up crimes where there isn\u2019t an obvious individual victim, or no victim to recall the event as is the case with murder\u2014but it is a much more reliable measure than police recorded crime.\n\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) found that government funding for councils in England fell by 49% between 2010/11 and 2017/18 in real terms. By 2019/20, it forecast the reduction to be 56%.\n\nGrants from the government aren\u2019t the only funding sources available to councils though. The two other main sources are revenue from business rates and council tax. The amount of funding from those two has increased in recent years, meaning that what councils have to spend (known as core spending power) has fallen by less than 50% overall. We\u2019ve written more about how this is calculated here.\n\nThe NAO found that councils\u2019 core spending power in England fell by 29% in real terms between 2010/11 and 2017/18.\n\nThe 15% figure is a significant overstatement. Between May 2010 and July 2019 in Great Britain, average weekly earnings in the public sector (excluding financial services) decreased by 1-2% in real terms.\n\nThe exact decrease depends on whether you use the CPI or CPIH measure of inflation, which are both valid measures.", "lang": "en"}
