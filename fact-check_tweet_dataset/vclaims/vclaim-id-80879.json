Patients are being treated symptomatically and being provided supportive care, depending on the severity of the disease. Coming to the nutrients being discussed, zinc and vitamin C are known to strengthen the immunity, but they are not a sure-shot cure for the novel coronavirus. Speaking to FIT, nutritionist Kavita Devgan explained, \u201cVitamin C is essential for the proper functioning of the phagocytes and T cells, the index fighters of our body. It also supports protein diction of antibodies in the oft that are important for a healthy immune system. Similarly, zinc also strengthens the immunity and keeps inflammation in check.\u201d But does this mean these can \u2018prevent\u2019 infection? Kavita explains,\n\nThis needs to be highlighted. Claims surrounding immunity-boosting techniques falter when they declare a certain ingredient or practice as a \u2018prevention\u2019 or \u2018cure\u2019, and not as a way of maintaining general health (which is actually what they do). Overall wellbeing and health is indeed important to fight an infection, as Kavita says, but this cannot prevent one from catching the infection in the first place - if the necessary precautions aren\u2019t followed. The World Health Organisation (WHO), while busting myths on the miraculous qualities of \u2018hot peppers\u2019 or \u2018saline\u2019, made a similar point,\n\nDr Sumit Ray, a critical care specialist in Delhi, explained that certain relatively smaller studies have shown vitamin C and zinc to have anti-inflammatory effects in general. Zinc is also given to diarrhoea patients. But nobody knows anything about its \u2018antiviral\u2019 benefits, specifically in the COVID setting.\n\n\u201cThere are trials on vitamin C for common cold, but even in those, there is no clarity on the reason why it seemed to help.\u201d He adds that although zinc and vitamin C may not harm COVID-19 patients if given in prescribed doses, the evidence for them preventing or treating the infection is not strong enough. It is important to remember that solid proof is needed before verifying a medical claim. The only way to protect ourselves from the infection is to follow the precautions we already know of: social distancing, maintaining hand and respiratory hygiene and wearing masks.\n\nYou can read FIT's WebQoof stories here to verify claims related to coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
