Who\u2019s benefited from these leaks? That\u2019s what you always look for. And obviously the portrayal of the president as a strong and courageous leader throughout this narrative is what it\u2019s all about. And the second aspect. of course, is that this administration has been blatantly political on all national security issues that I\u2019ve been observing of. And so, I think it\u2019s very clear that these leaks came from the White House, people within the White House itself and these people are very politically oriented.\u201d\n\nWe do not ordinarily do fact checks about statements from so far in the past. But we are returning to these comments, more than a year after they were made, because of this week\u2019s guilty plea by a former FBI agent for leaking classified information to the Associated Press about a CIA operation to obtain a bomb device made by al-Qaeda in Yemen. The disclosure came in the midst of several other high-profile leaks, and as you can see, lawmakers immediately jumped to the conclusion that the White House deliberately leaked the Yemen story to aid the president\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nAt that point, the administration generally freaks out. Either officials try to discourage publication or, failing that, they might work with the reporter to either put their own spin on the tale or to correct some misimpressions. That\u2019s because no reporter ever understands 100 percent of what\u2019s going on; he or she might only have 50 or 60 percent of it right.\n\nThe charging document for former FBI agent Donald Sachtleben (who, in an unrelated matter, also pled guilty in a child pornography case) is interesting reading and we have embedded it below. The document \u2014 which carefully makes no mention of a CIA operation \u2014 makes clear that Sachtleben did this on his own. His tip started with a gossipy discussion with a reporter about what might transpire at an upcoming Justice Department news conference. The reporter and Sachtleben had had a three-year reporter-source relationship, demonstrating that the leak came about because the reporter was diligent about developing contacts.\n\nOnce the AP approached the White House, the administration unsuccessfully tried to persuade it to hold off on publishing the story. Nevertheless, as our colleague Walter Pincus has documented, the AP still framed the story wrong, suggesting the administration had misled Americans about the possibility of al-Qaeda threats around the anniversary of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death. That wasn\u2019t the issue, as the operation was about getting the CIA\u2019s hands on the bomb.\n\nIn effect the story turned the disclosure of what was a highly secret, important clandestine operation into an action that somehow showed the Obama administration misleading the American public about the level of the al-Qaeda threat in the midst of a presidential election year. In an effort to counter the misimpression caused by the story, John Brennan, then-White House counterterrorism chief, along with others, held backgrounders with analysts and reporters and disclosed immediately after the AP story appeared that there was no threat to the United States \u2014 in effect, no real \u201cal-Qaeda plot\u201d because the whole affair was run by the CIA and was thus under U.S. control. The CIA use of a Saudi agent to get a bomb device by convincing the terrorists he would blow up an America-bound aircraft was a riveting story. But there were other goals for the operation, including finding the location in Yemen of the bomb builder. Not knowing all the facts when the original story was written, the AP had put the story in the wrong context. Those new facts that were released late on May 7 by the administration attempted to set the record right while also trying to control the political damage that could arise from the AP story.\n\nThis became an issue in Brennan\u2019s confirmation hearing to be CIA director, and so he provided written answers for the record about the briefing (starting on page 18.) Asked if he would have changed his briefing, Brennan said no and added: \u201cOnce someone leaked information about interdiction of the IED and that the IED was actually in our possession, it was imperative to inform the American people consistent with Government policy that there was never any danger to the American people associated with this al-Qaeda plot.\u201d\n\nSenator McCain\u2019s main question on these leaks, as he repeated in the CNN interview you cited, is, \u201cwho benefits?\u201d This week\u2019s guilty plea in the Yemen case is a positive development, but the last several years have seen a series of leaks that have obviously had the purpose and effect enhancing the Administration\u2019s image on national security issues. Washington Post reported leaks about the leaks investigation. The Post\u2019s report makes clear that individuals investigating these leaks, or otherwise associated with the investigations, were themselves leaking sensitive information to the press about how the leak investigations were being conducted. More recently there have been These include leaks about the \u201cStuxnet\u201d cyber attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, the drone \u201ckill list\u201d program \u2013 both of which are apparently still under investigation \u2013 as well as leaks of classified information about the bin Laden raid which were so egregious that then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates actually went to the White House to tell National Security Advisor Tom Donilon that the Administration needed to \u201cshut the f@*k up\u201d about it. Then, after overwhelming public pressure forced the Administration to appoint prosecutors to specifically investigate the leaks, theleaks about the leaks investigation. Thereport makes clear that individuals investigating these leaks, or otherwise associated with the investigations, were themselves leaking sensitive information to the press about how the leak investigations were being conducted.
