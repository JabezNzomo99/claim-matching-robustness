He adjusted his language somewhat \u2014 but not enough to avoid getting a bushel of Pinocchios.\n\nGoing back 12 years takes us to 2003, but presumably Santorum is referring to the Iran Freedom and Support Act of 2004, which he introduced on July 16, 2004. That bill mostly called for assistance to help foster democracy in Iran and had nothing to do with sanctions. It never came to a vote.\n\nThen, on Feb. 9, 2005, or about 10 years ago, Santorum introduced a bill titled the Iran Freedom and Support Act of 2005. This bill also focused on U.S. assistance for democracy in Iran, but in addition codified existing executive orders regarding a ban on U.S. investment and included some sanctions, such as against companies that assisted Iran\u2019s nuclear program. This bill also went nowhere.\n\n\u201cSenate Backs Bush\u2019s Iran Approach\u201d read the headline in the Arms Control Association\u2019s report on the vote. \u201cThe defeat followed an intervention by the Department of State, which said the measure would harm relations with countries needed as part of its diplomatic strategy,\u201d the article said, noting that many Republican co-sponsors of Santorum\u2019s legislation abandoned it after the administration objected.\n\nThen, after negotiations with the White House, a revised version of the legislation was introduced in the House on Sept. 27, 2006, removing a section that might upset countries (such as Russia, a key player in the negotiations) investing in projects in Iran linked to nuclear proliferation. The new version also gave the president waiver authority to terminate the sanctions with as little as a three-day notice. That bill passed by voice vote in the House and then was unanimously approved in the Senate.\n\nSantorum\u2019s claim that this bill was the root of \u201ccrushing sanctions\u201d now faced by Iran is an even bigger stretch. In effect, his law made relatively minor modifications to the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996, which was the first law that authorized U.S. penalties against third-country companies involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear activities. That law was further expanded by the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010.\n\nThe authoritative Iran Primer says another significant law was the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act, which significantly expanded the president\u2019s authority to sanction firms and individuals in Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. That law was originally passed in 2000, aimed squarely at Iran, and then later Syria and North Korea were added to it. Santorum\u2019s 2006 law does not even merit a mention in the Iran Primer.\n\nIndeed, as FactCheck.org reported, the Congressional Research Service in a 2014 report says that no sanctions have been imposed using the sanctions section of Santorum\u2019s law. The comprehensive CRS report, over 78 pages, barely mentions the law that Santorum claims is responsible for the \u201ccrushing sanctions\u201d on Iran.\n\nSantorum needs to significantly revise his history of this legislation. It\u2019s absurd to single out Obama and Clinton as his opposition when the real pushback came from the Bush administration. Even some of Santorum\u2019s Republican co-sponsors jumped ship. Once the administration accepted modified (and weaker) language, the law passed unanimously.\n\nMoreover, Santorum greatly overstates the impact of his law. His bill was a relatively minor moment in the years-long buildup of Iran sanctions \u2014 so minor that its core sanctions element has never been implemented. He did pass a law, which maybe counts for something, but such embellishment of the facts is worthy of Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
