Several social media users have posted the video suggesting that the students were from Anjuman school and chanted \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019.\n\nA Twitter user Roop Darak who is followed by BJP MP Amit Shah and railway minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s office shared the video with the message \u2013 \u201c\u0932\u094b \u0938\u093e\u0939\u0947\u092c \u0926\u0947\u0936\u0926\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0939\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u0938\u094c\u0930 \u0924\u0915 \u0906 \u0917\u090f \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u0941\u092e \u0918\u0930 \u092e\u0947 \u0939\u0940 \u0930\u0939\u0928\u093e \u092e\u0902\u0926\u0938\u094c\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0905\u0902\u091c\u0941\u092e\u0928 \u0938\u094d\u0915\u0942\u0932 \u0938\u0947 \u0928\u093f\u0915\u0932\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0940 \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u091c\u093f\u0902\u0926\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0913\u0930 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0913\u0930 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928 \u091a\u094b\u0930 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0932\u0917\u0935\u093e\u090f \u0913\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0924\u094b \u092f\u0947 \u0915\u0939\u0942\u0902\u0917\u093e \u0915\u093f \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0936\u093e\u0938\u0928 \u0928\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0930\u0939 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u0917\u0935\u093e\u090f (Look anti-nationals have reached Mandsaur and you stay at home. Pakistan Zindabad, Hindustan Murdabad and Hindustan Chor slogans were raised as soon as they left Anjuman school in Mandsaur. I believe that the slogans were raised with the help of police and state government.)\u201d\n\nAnother Twitter user, Vikram Samrat, who has mere 53 followers, among them railway minister Piyush Goyal, also circulated the video.\n\nA second clip is also viral on social media with the same claim.\n\nBoth the clips are equally viral on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA keyword search on Google led Alt News to several media reports which said that the students were protesting in support of the principal of their school. They did not raise \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans but chanted the name of their principal \u2013 \u2018Sabir sir zindabad\u2019.\n\nA local report by Nai Duniaprovides more details. An internal controversy between the school\u2019s principal and Anjuman committee secretary led to the protest. Secretary Md Hussein Risaldar accused principal Md Sabir Panwala of embezzling funds to the tune of Rs 1.5 crore and asked him to vacate his position. Amidst the allegations, Panwala shut down the school and his students took to the streets to sloganeer in his support. A video of the said event soon became viral on social media and certain organisations complained to the police that anti-national slogans were raised in the rally. The principal and many others, however, said that the students chanted \u2018Sabir sir zindabad\u2019.\n\nMandsaur CSP Narendra Solanki said in a video statement, \u201cThe children thought that their sir is being taken from them so they raised slogans of \u2018Sabir sir Zindabad\u2019. It is being propagated on social media that a particular community raised \u2018Pakistan Zindabad slogans\u2019. We performed a forensic analysis of the video, watched it in slow motion and found that they were raising \u2018Sabir sir zindabad\u2019 slogans. It is the police\u2019s appeal that if any incident becomes a law and order situation or communal conflict, do not send messages on social media before the police\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nIn a slow-motion version of one of the viral videos, the students\u2019 chants are more clearly audible.\n\nEarlier, a video where Congress workers were chanting \u2018Bhati Saab zindabad\u2019 was falsely propagated on social media that \u2018Pakistan zindabad\u2019 slogans were raised.", "lang": "en"}
