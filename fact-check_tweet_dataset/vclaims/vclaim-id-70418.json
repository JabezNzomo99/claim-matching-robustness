But hardly an original one.\n\n \n\n The DCCC made an identical Chinese prostitution attack against Jim Renacci, a Republican House member in Ohio. They also used it against Republican congressmen Scott DesJarlais in Tennessee and Jim Gerlach in Pennsylvania.\n\n \n\n What\u2019s behind this lurid campaign finance claim?\n\n \n\n Our colleagues in PolitiFact Ohio dug into the issue after Renacci was targeted. Here\u2019s what they found:\n\n \n\n The charge is tied to billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who has donated millions to Republicans. A fired former employee of Adelson\u2019s filed a lawsuit which alleges that Adelson personally approved of prostitution at properties his company owns in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that now is part of China.\n\n \n\n PolitiFact Ohio continued:\n\n \n\n The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn\u2019t spent anything so far.\n\n \n\n Adelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle.\n\n \n\n A spokesman for the Adelson\u2019s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always \"maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson\u2019s character.\"\n\n \n\n In a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine, Adelson said there\u2019s not a \"shred of evidence\" to back his former employee\u2019s charges, and \"says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) have given millions of dollars to set up clinics around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the \u2026 claims even more preposterous.\" Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau.\n\n \n\n The DCCC says \"Adelson has given $5 million to Speaker (John) Boehner\u2019s Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, pledged $5 million to Leader (Eric) Cantor\u2019s Young Guns Network Super PAC, given $70,800 to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and has committed at least $20 million into Karl Rove\u2019s American Crossroads.\"\n\n \n\n So Adelson has contributed or pledged plenty of money to Republican candidates or committees. That\u2019s clear. But the Chinese prostitution link is another matter.\n\n \n\n Here\u2019s how PolitiFact Ohio put it in their review of the claim against Renacci:\n\n \n\n Do unproven charges by a disgruntled former Adelson employee coupled with Adelson\u2019s generosity to GOP groups that are likely to back Renacci justify the DCCC\u2019s claim that \"foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci\u2019s Republican majority?\"\n\n \n\n We don\u2019t think so.\n\n \n\n Neither do we.\n\n \n\n As our Ohio colleagues point out, the allegation that Adelson allowed prostitution at the Macau comes from a fired employee. The DCCC takes that claim and says money from prostitution was included in Adelson\u2019s campaign contributions to GOP congressional incumbents -- including Duffy.\n\n \n\n There\u2019s no evidence that Duffy received contributions from Adelson, and he has no control over contributions to groups that support him.\n\n \n\n \"The claim that Adelson\u2019s donations to these other groups amount to \u2018Chinese prostitution money\u2019 is dubious enough that inserting the word \u2018allegedly\u2019 can\u2019t save it,\" PolitiFact Ohio wrote in its assessment.\n\n \n\n That holds no matter what name is inserted into the cut-and-paste news release.\n\n \n\n You can repeat a claim, but the smell of smoke remains the same. Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
