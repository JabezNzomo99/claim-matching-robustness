You\u2019ll receive one if you breach parking rules on public land or break certain traffic rules.\n\nA parking charge notice is issued by a private company if you, for example, break parking conditions in a private car park.\n\nThere is a third type of ticket\u2014a fixed penalty notice parking fine which can be issued by the police, either for more serious parking offences, or where the police, rather than councils, enforce parking rules in public spaces.\n\nWhat to do if you get a parking charge notice?\n\nThe post says that if you receive a parking charge notice you should just ignore it, even if the company threatens you with court.\n\nMoney Saving Expert (whose founder, Martin Lewis, is implied to be the original source of this advice in the Facebook post) actually says: \u201cLandowners have a right to charge for and police parking, eg, if you've blocked a hospital entrance.\n\n\u201cIf you've broken the rules, and you think the ticket isn't exorbitant or disproportionate, pay up.\u201d\n\nMartin Lewis has previously confirmed that an older version of the same Facebook post does not represent his advice.\n\nThe government says that, normally, a driver parking on private land (with clear signage setting out the terms and conditions of parking) enters into a contract with the car park owner.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve got a ticket for breaking the terms set out, then you should pay your fine. Non-payment could lead to a higher charge or even legal procedures and associated costs.\n\nHowever if you believe that you have a case for appeal, then Citizens Advice recommend that you don\u2019t pay the charge immediately. Paying the charge can be seen as an admission of responsibility.\n\nNot paying immediately is not the same as completely ignoring the notice, however.\n\nYour best course of action will depend on the precise circumstances (such as whether the company that gave you the ticket is a member of an \u201caccredited trade association\u201d), but in many cases it will involve contacting the company. Money Saving Expert explicitly say they do not recommend the approach of totally ignoring the ticket.\n\nFurther advice on whether you have grounds for appeal, and how to appeal is available from Citizen\u2019s Advice.\n\nPenalty charge notices (issued by the councils and police) can also be appealed against; it\u2019s not just parking charge notices.", "lang": "en"}
