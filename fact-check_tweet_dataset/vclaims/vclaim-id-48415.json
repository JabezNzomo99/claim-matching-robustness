No, that's not true: Pitt, who grew up as a Christian, told a GQ magazine interviewer in 2019 that he \"called myself an atheist for a while\" during a \"rebellious\" time of his life, but he returned to \"spirituality.\" The actor never told the interviewer that he has \"become a Christian\" while dealing with alcoholism. He also never mentioned \"finding God.\"\n\nThe misleading claim originated in an article (archived here) published by UpliftingToday.com in September 2019 under the title \"Former Atheist Brad Pitt Becomes A Christian As He Recovers From Alcoholism\". It opened:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe midleading story is based on two GQ interviews with Pitt, one from May 2017 and the second published in October 2019.\n\nIn GQ's 2017 cover story titled \"Brad Pitt Talks Divorce, Quitting Drinking, and Becoming a Better Man,\" Pitt describe his religious upbringing in a strict Christian home, including the charismatic Christian practice of \"speaking in tongues\" during church services.\n\nIn 2019 cover story titled \"Brad Pitt Is Still Searching,\" Pitt is quoted talking about his spiritual journey from a Baptist, charismatic Christian, agnostic, athiest, and then to spirituality:\n\n\"Oh, man, I've gone through everything. Like, I cling to religion. I grew up with Christianity. Always questioned it, but it worked at times. And then when I got on my own, I completely left it and I called myself agnostic. Tried a few spiritual things but didn't feel right. Then I called myself an atheist for a while, just kind of being rebellious. I wasn't really. But I kinda labeled myself that for a while. It felt punk rock enough. And then I found myself coming back around to just belief in--I hate to use the word spirituality, but just a belief in that we're all connected.\"\n\nPitt does not say anywhere in either GQ interview that he has returned to Christianity or found God in the wake of his failed marriage. He speaks of returning to spirituality, but does indicate it was related to the divorce.\n\nThe UpliftingToday.com article adds context and details to Pitt's story to make it appear that his divorce from Angelina Jolie was the trigger for this, but that is never said by Pitt.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes upliftingtoday.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
