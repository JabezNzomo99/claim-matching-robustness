This independent office oversees the implementation of national and county government budgets in Kenya.\n\nFive departments in one ministry\n\nto the transport and infrastructure ministry on 24 November 2015, moving from the health docket. When he took office, the ministry was\n\nadded three more: the departments of public works; housing and urban development; and shipping and maritime affairs.\n\nThe national treasury allocates budgetary funds to the departments in ministries based on existing executive orders.\n\nBudget allocations to ministries are in the Appropriations Act, which is used by parliament to guide public spending. But these can be altered during a financial year. This is what John Kinuthia,\n\nat the Kenya office of the budget thinktank\n\n\u201cSometimes changes happen due to poor budget implementation. So the national treasury may decide to move the money to more \u2018productive\u2019 areas of the budget before the year ends,\u201d said Kinuthia.\n\nhas the final figures, including on allocations and expenditure.\n\nOver three financial years, between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2018, the ministry\u2019s development allocation was KSh814.9 billion. This was 38% \u2013 not 47% as\n\nby the Standard \u2013 of the total development budget of KSh2.1 trillion.\n\nOther scenarios still lower than Standard\u2019s figure\n\nYou might consider that cabinet secretary Macharia was only appointed at least five months after the 2015/16 allocations. In the 2016/17 financial year, when he was fully in charge, the ministry\u2019s share of the total was 39% \u2013 still lower than 47%.\n\nIf you check expenditure as per the paper\u2019s clarification, the share is still lower than 47%. Of the KSh1.5 trillion spent on national development between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2018, some KSh600 billion \u2013 or 41% \u2013 was by Macharia\u2019s ministry. (\n\nWhile the allocations to the ministry appear \u201cskewed\u201d, this was a policy decision and not a legal requirement, Kwame Owino, chief executive of the\n\nThe significant spending in Macharia\u2019s ministry can be explained by the Kenyatta administration\u2019s \u201cinfrastructure spending binge\u201d, Owino said. These include billion-shilling spending on road and rail projects.\n\nConclusion: Evidence does not show \u2018super\u2019 minister allocated 47% share of Kenya development budget\n\nthat since 2015, the transport and infrastructure ministry under James Macharia has been allocated the lion\u2019s share of the country\u2019s development funds.\n\nThe Standard gave this share as 47%. But none of the evidence offered in support of this shows this. According to official numbers, the ministry has since the 2015/16 financial year been allocated 38% of the development budget. If only expenditure is considered, the ministry\u2019s share is 41%.\n\nWe therefore rate the 47% claim as incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
