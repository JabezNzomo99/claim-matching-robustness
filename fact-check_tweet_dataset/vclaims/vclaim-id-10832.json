That\u2019s 4.3% of people aged 16 or over classed as economically active\u2014those either in work or looking for work.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the last time the unemployment rate was this low was in 1975.\n\nThe unemployment rate varies for different groups of people. For example, the unemployment rate for men is the same as the UK-wide total\u20144.3% and the lowest since 1975. For women it\u2019s even lower, 4.2% and the joint-lowest it has been since records began in 1971.\n\n11.9% of 16 to 24 year olds (either in work or looking for it) were unemployed during the same period. That figure includes full-time students looking for part-time work. It\u2019s also the lowest it has been since 2004.\n\nUnemployment measures people without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks, or who have found a job and are waiting to start in the next two weeks.\n\nThese figures don\u2019t tell us anything about \u201cunderemployment\u201d. That\u2019s the number of people seeking more hours, working no more than the maximum weekly working hours already, and able to work more within the next two weeks. We\u2019ve written about this before here.", "lang": "en"}
