The posts were shared after New Zealand's government reimposed a coronavirus lockdown on the city of Auckland after it recorded the country\u2019s first local transmissions of COVID-19 in more than 100 days. The claim in the posts is false; the image has circulated online in news reports since at least 2016; New Zealand health officials said no tourists have been allowed into the country since March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe image was posted here on Facebook by a New Zealand-based user on August 12, 2020. The post has been shared more than 100 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads in part: \u201cMainland CCP Chinese tourists allowed to go out of the Auckland bubble, no quarantine for them for two weeks.\u201d\n\nThe claim circulated online following the New Zealand government's announcement on August 11, 2020 that coronavirus lockdown measures would be reimposed in Auckland. The move came after four COVID-19 cases were reported in the city -- the first cases in the country in 102 consecutive days, AFP reported here.\n\nThe image was also shared hundreds of times on Facebook here and here alongside a similar claim.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the image in the misleading post published in this January 2016 article by New Zealand media outlet Stuff.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cNearly 50,000 Chinese tourists arrive in NZ for February's Golden Week,\u201d said record numbers of Chinese tourists were expected to arrive in the country in 2016.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post (L) and the 2016 Stuff photo (R):\n\nIn response to an AFP inquiry on August 14, a New Zealand Ministry of Health spokesperson said tourists had been banned from entering the country since March 2020.\n\n\u201cTourists from any country have been unable to enter New Zealand since our borders were closed prior to level 4 lockdown in March 2020. To enter NZ after this date you need to be a New Zealand citizen or resident, or meet strict exception criteria,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email.", "lang": "en"}
