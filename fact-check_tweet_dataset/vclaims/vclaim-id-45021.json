The post claims that US streets are overflowing with protesters against President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to ruin Americans using coronavirus as a weapon.\n\nFacebook user Riyaz Khan Khan shared the image along with a post in Hindi which translates to, \u201cAmericans are descending on the streets. Trump wanted to ruin Americans using coronavirus as a weapon, but he was trapped in his own game. His Indian friend too is betraying his own people, all the while addressing them as brothers and sisters. If you stay with bad people, you will do bad things. Indians too are boiling with rage and ready to take to the streets. Change the government of the dishonest.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the image to be misleading. The viral picture has nothing to do with US, Trump or coronavirus. It is a three-year-old picture from Spain.\n\nThe June 1 post by \u201cRiyaz Khan Khan\u201d has been shared more than 1,200 times till the filing of this story. The archived version can be seen here. The post is viral on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\n\nUsing reverse image search, we found the un-cropped version of the viral photo in an article by The Atlantic.\n\nAs per the report, the picture was taken on February 18, 2017, when thousands of people marched in Barcelona to urge the Spanish government to take in refugees who have fled the war in Syria and other conflict zones. The report says Spain had taken in just 1,100 refugees of the more than 17,000 it had pledged to accept.\n\nThe same picture was also used by The Guardian in February 2017 with the same information.\n\nThough it is true that the US is on the boil, but the viral picture is unrelated and from Spain. Protests, often violent, have broken out across US cities following the death of African-American George Floyd whose arrest by a white police officer turned fatal. The police officer was filmed putting his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck even as he repeated that he could not breathe.\n\nREAD | Another video shows bodies wrapped in plastic lying next to patients at Mumbai\u2019s KEM Hospital\n\nWATCH | Ground report: As city battles Covid-19, here's an inside story of 2 Mumbai hospitals", "lang": "en"}
