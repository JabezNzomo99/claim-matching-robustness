He won\u2019t even take office until Jan. 1, 2018.\n\n\n\nDemocratic Hoboken Councilman-at-Large Ravinder Bhalla is not Muslim. He actually became the first Sikh to win a mayoral election in New Jersey on Nov. 7\n\nBut several websites have posted a fabricated story with the headline: \u201cMuslim New Jersey Mayor Just Abolished Christmas \u2018To Respect Other Religions.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBhalla will officially take office on November 29, just in time for Christmas,\u201d the story wrongly says. \u201cBut the wreath will not be hung nor will the carolers be singing with joy because Bhalla has cancelled all \u2018government involvement in the Christian holiday Christmas\u2019 out of respect for \u2018other religions.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere have been no attempts to change any of Hoboken\u2019s planned Christmas activities, Juan Melli, the city\u2019s spokesman, told FactCheck.org. As Bhalla won\u2019t be sworn in as mayor until Jan. 1, 2018, it\u2019s not possible for him to enact changes for this holiday season.\n\nChristmas continues to be a holiday observed by the city, which is still holding its annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony and Holiday Crafts Fair at City Hall in early December. Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus will make appearances, too.\n\nThe bogus story originated on a self-described satirical website called Reagan Was Right, which says in an \u201cabout\u201d section on each page that \u201cnothing on this site is real.\u201d\n\nThe picture of Bhalla that ran with the story on reaganwasright.com came from his Facebook page, where it was posted on Election Day with a message encouraging people to vote.\n\nHowever, the same article was posted a day later on beforeitsnews.com, which allows \u201ccontributors\u201d to upload stories to its site as long as they are \u201cfactually true.\u201d It was not labeled as satire on that site.\n\nThe made-up story exploits a common misperception about Sikh men by referring to American-born Bhalla, who wears a peaked turban, as a Muslim.\n\nSikhism is a monotheistic religion that was founded by Guru Nanak in the late 15th century in the Punjab region of India. It is not the same as the much older religion of Islam, followed by Muslims, that shares roots with Christianity and Judaism. For example, Sikhs believe in reincarnation, and Muslims believe in heaven and hell.\n\nMany Muslim men wear turbans, but not all men who wear them are Muslims.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nOtterman, Sharon. \u201cIn a City of Firsts, Hoboken Elects a Sikh as Mayor.\u201d New York Times. 8 Nov 2017.\n\n\u201cMuslim New Jersey Mayor Just Abolished Christmas \u2018To Respect Other Religions.'\u201d Reaganwasright.com. 9 Nov 2017.", "lang": "en"}
