Why isn\u2019t the media showing this???\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmedia\u201d likely isn\u2019t showing it because the photo is, in fact, from the 1985 Live Aid concert in London\u2019s Wembley Stadium. (There was a simultaneous Live Aid show held in Philadelphia.)\n\nThe photo in question has been doctored to display Trump campaign signage over that for the concert. The unadulterated image is available through the photography website Shutterstock; it was also shared in 2014 on a Facebook page dedicated to Live Aid. A similar image from the same vantage point of the concert can be seen on Getty Images.\n\nThe iconic show drew an estimated 72,000 to the London venue on July 13, 1985, for a lineup that included Queen, U2, Elton John and David Bowie. Some 100,000 people also attended the show at Philadelphia\u2019s since-demolished JFK Stadium. The dual-venue event raised millions to assist with the famine in Ethiopia.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that images of crowds have been misused in this way. We recently debunked a false claim that an image showed another Trump rally in Pennsylvania. That picture was actually from Woodstock.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
