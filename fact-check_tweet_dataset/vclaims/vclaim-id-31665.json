The viral images on Facebook are not from Gujarat.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we have found the original sources of both the viral images.\n\nThis viral picture was taken from a website \"wallpaperflare.com\". This wallpaper picture is not real but a graphical representation of a \"Futuristic cityscape, green grass, fantasy\" as described in the caption of the picture on the website.\n\nThis viral picture has been used several times on various news websites as a file photo for Mumbai slums.\n\n\"DNA\" news website used it on June 12, 2016, on a news report on Mumbai slums.\n\nAnother website \"Nyoooz.com\" used the same image in a 2016 news report regarding \"Brihanmumbai Municipal corporation\".\n\nHence, it is clear that the viral images used in the post have no Gujarat connection.", "lang": "en"}
