The U.S. paid over $400 million to the organization in 2019.\n\nChina has become a key target as Trump readies for the 2020 election and its role as the birthplace of the virus is central to Trump\u2019s overarching message. But Trump\u2019s case against China, as outlined in the WHO letter and elsewhere, had several factual errors and omitted key details.\n\nThe Lancet said in a letter posted on Twitter, \"this statement is factually incorrect.\"\n\n\"The Lancet published no report in December 2019 referring to a virus or outbreak in Wuhan or anywhere else in China.\" the journal said.\n\nIts first articles came on Jan. 24, 2020. One described the first 41 patients with COVID-19 documented by Chinese doctors and researchers. The other described the first hard evidence of person-to-person transmission.\n\nFor its part, WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said WHO first picked up signs of an emerging infectious disease Dec. 31 through its epidemic monitoring system and the next day asked China for more details. It also activated a unit called the Incident Management Support Team to coordinate WHO\u2019s response.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s own letter cast doubt on the charge that WHO knew something in early December. After leveling the accusation, it said, \"By no later than Dec. 30, 2019, the World Health Organization office in Beijing knew that there was a \u2018major public health\u2019 concern in Wuhan.\" That broadly aligns with what Tedros said, allowing that the scale of the outbreak was still unknown.\n\nThis exaggerates both what Taiwan said in an email to WHO and what WHO did as it learned more about the outbreak.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Dec. 31 email to WHO said news reports in China \"indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan.\" The email went on to say that Chinese health officials said \"the cases were believed not SARS, however, the samples are still under examination, and cases have been isolated for treatment.\"\n\nTaiwan asked for more information. There was nothing specific about person-to-person transmission, but the comparison to SARS, an infectious disease, and the isolation of patients showed that infectiousness was seen as a possibility.\n\nWHO said that after formally asking China on Jan. 1 to verify the cluster of cases, it tweeted about the incident on Jan. 4 and provided more details on its emergency information site Jan. 5, a site used by all WHO members.\n\nThis could be partially accurate, but it pushes the limits of what is actually known.\n\nA doctor in Wuhan warned his colleagues in a chat group about a disease that looked like SARS on Dec. 30. Local officials muzzled the doctor, who later died from COVID-19.\n\n\"We now have good evidence that Chinese authorities knew about the spread and were hiding it at this time,\" Ashish K. Jha, director of Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute told us in April. \"Whistleblowers and \u2018rumor mongers\u2019 among healthcare professionals were silenced. But it\u2019s unclear how much the WHO could have possibly known about that at the time.\"\n\nAll the same, China reported the disease cluster by Dec. 31. It is also unclear how well doctors in Wuhan were connecting the dots.\n\nThe Chinese government stifled legitimate questioning, but it\u2019s also possible that the progression period for the illness itself made it harder for health professionals to spot patterns. Chinese epidemiologists and physicians wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that they estimated the first case occurred Dec. 10, but nearly 90% of the cases were not hospitalized until five days after the first sign of illness. That could have delayed how quickly the disease raised red flags.\n\nThe bottom line is that the gap is still unknown.\n\nThis blends an accurate statement with the assumption that WHO knew that China was hiding key data.\n\nOn Jan. 12, WHO said that \"there is no clear evidence that the virus passes easily from person to person.\"\n\nOn Jan. 14, WHO\u2019s lead investigator Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters that \"it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission.\"\n\nVan Kerkhove, however, warned that a wider outbreak was possible and that WHO had told hospitals around the world to take steps to prevent spreading the infection.\n\nThe missing piece here is that Trump\u2019s letter assumes that WHO knew more about the situation on the ground than China was letting on, but he provides no evidence for that.\n\nThe quotes from Tedros are accurate. He said those things after his meeting with Xi.\n\nWhat Trump leaves out is that he also praised Xi at that time.\n\n\"China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus, Trump tweeted Jan. 24. \"The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.\"", "lang": "en"}
