The label in the image reads:\n\n\"This product is an ear loop mask, this product is not a respirator and will not provide any protections against COVID-19 (coronavirus) and other viruses or contaminants.\"\n\nThe photo appears to be legitimate. But the words on the label are being misinterpreted as evidence to suggest that masks are not effective.\n\nOne person who posted the picture wrote: \"Gee....wonder how many people are gonna tell me I haven't done my research now? Black and white. Right there. Even the people making the masks know it's all bull.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s not what this photo shows. This is a misunderstanding about the kind of protection standard masks provide and a misreading of the disclaimer, which isn\u2019t saying the masks are ineffective at limiting the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nCertain medical-grade masks, such as the N95 respirator, offer the most protection against viral particles for the wearer because it can filter aerosol particles as small as 0.3 micron.\n\nBut other masks, like the ear-loop ones in the photo or homemade cloth masks, are effective in reducing the spread of the disease, or what health experts call \"source control.\" When you wear these masks it is most helpful to people around you.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn\u2019t recommend that the general public wear medical-grade masks like the N95 because they are in high demand, and officials say they should be reserved for health care workers who are in direct contact with infected patients.\n\nAs an additional public health measure, the agency recommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings to help slow the spread of COVID-19 (emphasis ours):\n\nThe \"CDC still recommends that you stay at least 6 feet away from other people (social distancing), frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms.\"\n\nJeremy Howard, a data scientist at the University of San Francisco, wrote an article in the Conversation in favor of universal mask wearing.\n\nHoward says that researchers were looking at the wrong question at first \u2013 how well a mask protects the wearer from infection \u2013 and not how well a mask prevents an infected person from spreading the virus. He said masks function very differently as personal protective equipment versus \"source control.\"\n\nA photograph of a box of disposable masks shows a warning label that says the masks \"will not provide any protections against COVID-19.\"\n\nSuch disclaimers don\u2019t mean that the masks are ineffective at slowing the spread of the disease, but that they don\u2019t protect the wearer as well as medical respirators such as the N95 recommended for use by health care professionals. Disposable and homemade cloth masks are recommended for people to wear because it protects others around them in case they have the virus and may not be showing any symptoms.\n\nThe users sharing this image are making a false interpretation of the type of protection standard face masks provide.
