Mark Pocan blasted Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s ability to keep his No.1 campaign promise during the Democratic Party of Wisconsin\u2019s annual convention.\n\nPocan, D-Madison, attacked Walker and Republican lawmakers on job growth and other issues during his 15-minute speech, at one point focusing on the governor\u2019s failed 2010 campaign promise to add 250,000 private-sector jobs within his first term.\n\n\"Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs,\" Pocan said halfway through his June 2, 2017 speech.\n\nThe convention took place as state Democrats seek to ramp up support among its base before the 2018 mid-term elections.\n\nWalker is expected to be on the ballot again, seeking a third term. So the promise is likely to come up again \u2026 and again.\n\nHere, we\u2019ll briefly revisit Walker\u2019s original promise, and see where the jobs tally currently stands.\n\nIn 2010, Walker first sought the governor\u2019s office on the promise that he would bring 250,000 private-sector jobs to Wisconsin by the end of his first term.\n\n\"(Scott Walker will) get government out of the way of employers ... who will then help Wisconsin create 250,000 jobs by 2015, and as we create those new jobs, we will be able to add 10,000 new businesses,\" his campaign said at the time.\n\nFor the years 2011 through 2014, Wisconsin added 130,153 private-sector jobs, meaning Walker fell short of his first-term promise by about 100,000 jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.\n\nFor this tally, we used the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which surveys nearly all state businesses, to get the most accurate picture for Walker's years in office. We made comparisons using the fourth quarter reports from the QCEW.\n\nOn the Walk-O-Meter, which we use to track the governor\u2019s campaign promises, we rated Walker\u2019s pledge as a Promise Broken when economists said in September 2014 that it was impossible to reach his the target by the end of his first term.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s economy has continued to add jobs throughout Walker\u2019s second term, but at a much slower pace.\n\nThe fourth quarter numbers for 2015 and 2016 from the BLS show Wisconsin added 38,077 and 11,548 jobs respectively. The 2016 growth numbers were the worst during Walker\u2019s tenure and the worst since the economy rebounded after the 2008-\u201909 recession.\n\nIn total, Wisconsin has added a total of 179,778 private sector jobs during Walker\u2019s near seven years as governor, which puts him 70,000 short of the pledged 250,000 new jobs.\n\nPocan spokesman David Kolovson said in an email that the congressman\u2019s claim was based on a March 12, 2017 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, which stated the governor\u2019s promise \"remains elusive.\"\n\nThe Journal Sentinel story listed the total number of jobs under Walker as 185,208, which differs from the total offered here because that article was published before the BLS released final numbers covering the end of 2016.\n\nWalker spokesman Tom Evenson also pointed to the same story and Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development numbers, saying in email \"we don\u2019t have anything to add.\"\n\n\"Wisconsin\u2019s business climate has consistently improved from one of the worst in the nation to one of the best under Governor Walker, and our state\u2019s economy is in the best shape it\u2019s been in 16 years,\" Evenson said quoted as saying in the March story. \"We\u2019ve seen more people employed than ever before, wages are up, and Wisconsin\u2019s labor force participation rate continues to be one of the best in the country.\"\n\nAnd yet, the topic of job creation under Walker lingers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ran on the platform of being a jobs president, famously saying \"I\u2019ll be the greatest jobs president God ever created.\"\n\nIn a June 13, 2017 visit to Wisconsin, President Donald Trump hinted at a major manufacturer locating to Wisconsin.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel reported on June 15 that Foxconn, a Taiwanese company that assembles Apple\u2019s iPhones and other electronics, is considering Wisconsin as the site for a 1,000-acre manufacturing plant, which could generate thousands of jobs.\n\nAt the Democratic Party of Wisconsin\u2019s state convention, Pocan said, \"Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs.\"\n\nPocan is right to say Walker hasn\u2019t hit his first campaign promise.\n\nIn 2014, we rated Walker\u2019s campaign pledge as a Promise Broken. The number of jobs created still falls short of that promise.", "lang": "en"}
