The claim is false; the photo is a Getty Images photo of a 2018 rally for gun reform in Washington D.C.\n\nThe misleading post, which has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook since it was published on March 11, 2019, contains a photo of a street filled with people, many of whom are carrying placards.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201cHugpong ng Pagbabago rally. Thanks for being one with us\u201d. Hugpong ng Pagbabago, which means \u201cAlliance for Change\u201d in Tagalog, is a regional political party.\n\nIt is chaired by Sara Duterte, daughter of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and mayor of the southern city of Davao.\n\nThe party has announced it is endorsing a handful of mainly pro-administration candidates in the Philippines\u2019 midterm elections in May.\n\nAFP conducted a reverse image search and found the photo used in the misleading post was actually taken by international photo agency Getty Images.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Getty photo:\n\nThe caption says the image was taken on March 24, 2018 and shows protesters at a \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d rally in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d rallies were held across the US on March 24, 2018, calling for gun law reforms following a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in February 2018.\n\nHere is an AFP report on the shooting. Here is an AFP report on a \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d rally in Parkland, Florida on March 24, 2018.\n\nHere is the location of the Getty Images photo on Google Street View:\n\nBelow is the Getty photo (left) alongside the photo used in the misleading Facebook post (right).\n\nThe original and misleading images both have the same key details: a building in the left background with several columns, a boxy glass building to the right and rows of distinctive street lights with round lamps.\n\nUsing Invid, an image and video verification tool, AFP magnified an element that can be seen in both the original and the misleadingly used image: a placard bearing the letters \u201cNRA\u201d.\n\nAFP has circled the two placards in the crowd that are identical in both images:", "lang": "en"}
