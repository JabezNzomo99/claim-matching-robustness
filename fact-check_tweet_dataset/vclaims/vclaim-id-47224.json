However, at no point in the suit did the plaintiffs ask for the rally to be stopped. Their petition explicitly says: \u201cPlaintiffs do not seek an order barring the President from conducting a political rally in Tulsa on June 20th or any other day.\u201d\n\nRather, the suit says the plaintiffs \u201cmerely seek a court order requiring ASM Global to institute appropriate social distancing protocols for the June 20th event, including the mandatory use of face-masks and social distancing rules for all guests and employees, as recommended by state, local, and federal authorities, and by every credible and qualified expert who has studied this issue.\u201d On Tuesday, a judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request.\n\nThe plaintiffs are far from alone in their concern, with health experts and local officials agreeing that a rally at this time, especially one indoors, is a bad idea.\n\nWhile the plaintiffs sought an injunction if the venue did not comply, it is not accurate to say, as the Trump campaign did, that they sued specifically to prevent the rally from taking place.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
