Navarro then wrote another memo dated Feb. 23, saying the illness could claim the lives of 1 million to 2 million Americans, the news reports, which included images of the memos, said.\n\nKudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, made the claim May 3 in an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d On the show, Kudlow defended having previously declared in a Feb. 25 CNBC interview that the U.S. had \u201ccontained\u201d the coronavirus \u201cpretty close to airtight.\u201d\n\nTapper, May 3: I guess the reason for the disconnect is that, sometimes, the people who understandably want to get the economy up and running have been saying things that contradict what some of the people who are health experts in the administration are saying. For instance, at the end of February, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who apparently got in the doghouse for saying in a conference call \u2014 doghouse with President Trump \u2014 for saying in a conference call that it was not a matter of if, but when there would be a severe disruption to the American people and our way to live life, and that\u2019s the same day, as you know, that you said this. Kudlow: We have contained this, I won\u2019t say airtight, but pretty close to airtight. We have done a good job in the United States. Tapper: So, I guess the question is, is there a disconnect between what people such as you, who want things to be better than they are, so as to help the economy, are saying and what people in the health field are saying? Kudlow: Well, look, Jake, for the umpteenth time, I will say, my quote then was based on the actual facts, which, at the time, there were only 40 or 50 cases. And it was contained, particularly after President Trump boldly put up travel restrictions with China. That\u2019s what the data \u2014 I didn\u2019t make a forecast. So far \u2014 and that was just \u2014 there was hardly any cases, OK? Now, yes, some doctors were more fearful. Other doctors had many different things to say. I don\u2019t want to get in and play this game who said what and when. Political leaders, one well-known political leader in the House, went to Chinatown in San Francisco and said, everything is OK, OK? One important anchor on your network as late as mid-March said, basically, the COVID-19 virus was no worse than an ordinary flu year. I mean, there are people saying \u2014 my quote was, at that time, there were very few cases. Then, as the virus spread exponentially in ways that virtually no one could have predicted, of course, we changed our mind.\n\nAt the time of Kudlow\u2019s Feb. 25 interview, there were 57 reported cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. and no known deaths. But, as we all now know, the virus that causes the illness was far from being \u201ccontained\u201d in the country. (As of May 4, there were more than 1.15 million cases and over 67,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)\n\nBut it is inaccurate to say that, as of Feb. 25, \u201cvirtually no one could have predicted\u201d such a widespread outbreak in the U.S. There were several people who predicted the virus could or would spread to become a pandemic \u2014 including members of Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nJan. 28 \u2014 According to emails obtained by the New York Times, Carter Mecher, a senior medical adviser to the Department of Veterans Affairs, sent a note to several administration colleagues on Jan. 28 advocating closing schools, as well as colleges and universities, to prevent further transmission of the coronavirus.\n\nMecher, Jan. 28: The chatter on the blogs is that WHO [World Health Organzation] and CDC are behind the curve. I\u2019m seeing comments from people asking why WHO and CDC seem to be downplaying this. I\u2019m certainly no public health expert (just a dufus from the VA), but no matter how I look at this, it looks [to] be bad. If we assume the same case ascertainment rate as the spring wave of 2009 H1N1, this looks nearly as transmissible as flu (but with a longer incubation period and greater Ro). The projected size of the outbreak already seems hard to believe, but when I think of the actions being taken across China that are reminiscent of 1918 Philadelphia [during the influenza pandemic], perhaps those numbers are correct. And if we accept that level of transmissibility, the CFR [case fatality rate] is approaching the range of a severe flu pandemic. But if we assume the case ascertainment rate is better than H1N1 and transmissibility is less than flu (it is still much more transmissible than SARS), and the CFR goes accordingly (1918 pandemic range). And if we assume the case ascertainment rate is even worse than 2009 H1N1, this is really unbelievable (higher transmissibility than flu). Any way you cut it, this is going to be bad. You guys made fun of me screaming to close the schools. Now I\u2019m screaming, close the colleges and universities.\n\n\n\nJan. 29 \u2014 Navarro, who heads the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, wrote a memo \u2014 addressed to the National Security Council \u2014 that looked at what might happen if the outbreak turned into a \u201ctrue pandemic.\u201d In a worst-case scenario, Navarro said COVID-19 could lead to the loss of almost $6 trillion and the deaths of 543,000 Americans, according to the memo, published by the political website Axios.\n\nJan. 30 \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar \u201cdirectly warned\u201d Trump \u201cof the possibility of a pandemic during a call \u2026 the second warning he delivered to the president about the virus in two weeks,\u201d according to the Times.\n\nFeb. 12 \u2014 Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said it was inevitable COVID-19 would spread in the U.S.\n\n\u201cMost of the disease is in China, however, we can and should be prepared for this new virus to gain a foothold in the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cThe goal of the measures we have taken to date are to slow the introduction and impact of this disease in the United States, but at some point, we are likely to see community spread in the U.S. or other countries.\u201d\n\nFeb. 14 \u2014 According to the New York Times, HHS and National Security Council officials drafted a memo, dated Feb. 14 and titled \u201cU.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus,\u201d that mentioned several \u201cquarantine and isolation measures\u201d that may be necessary to slow the spread of the virus in places where there is \u201csustained human-to-human transmission.\u201d\n\nThose tactics included: \u201csignificantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone. \u2026 [S]chool closures. Widespread \u2018stay at home\u2019 directives from public and private organizations with nearly 100% telework for some.\u201d\n\nAlso on Feb. 14, the Wall Street Journal quoted Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University professor of epidemiology, as saying: \u201cI think it is likely we\u2019ll see a global pandemic. If a pandemic happens, 40% to 70% of people world-wide are likely to be infected in the coming year. What proportion of those will be symptomatic, I can\u2019t give a good number.\u201d\n\nFeb. 21 \u2014 During a mock pandemic exercise, members of the White House coronavirus task force \u201cconcluded they would soon need to move toward aggressive social distancing, even at the risk of severe disruption to the nation\u2019s economy and the daily lives of millions of Americans,\u201d the New York Times would later report.\n\nThat same day, Messonnier said at a CDC briefing that \u201cit would be impossible\u201d to \u201ccatch every traveler with coronavirus from China,\u201d so \u201cour goal continues to be slowing the introduction of the virus into the U.S. This buys us more time to prepare our communities for more cases and possibly sustained spread.\u201d\n\nShe warned, too, about possible school and business closings. \u201c[I]f you\u2019re watching the news, you may be hearing about schools shutting down and businesses closing in countries in Asia to reduce the potential spread of this virus,\u201d Messonnier said. \u201cThe day may come where we need to implement such measures in the U.S. communities.\u201d\n\nFeb. 23 \u2014 Navarro, according to Axios, wrote a second memo dated Feb. 23 and addressed to Trump, saying: \u201cThere is an increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans with a loss of life of as many as 1-2 million souls.\u201d\n\nFeb. 24 \u2014 WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told countries to prepare for the global health emergency to become a pandemic. He said: \u201cDoes this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely, it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet. \u2026 We must focus on containment, while doing everything we can to prepare for a potential pandemic.\u201d (On March 11, the WHO declared the outbreak a global pandemic.)\n\nFeb. 25 \u2014 On the same day as Kudlow\u2019s CNBC interview, Messonnier did say \u201ccontainment strategies\u201d in the U.S. \u201chave been largely successful.\u201d But, she again cautioned that: \u201cUltimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country. It\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d\n\nAll of those warnings were made prior to, or the day of, Kudlow claiming the coronavirus had been \u201ccontained.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, as we have written before, experts have long warned of a potentially catastrophic outbreak of global disease for which the U.S. might not be prepared.\n\nFactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
