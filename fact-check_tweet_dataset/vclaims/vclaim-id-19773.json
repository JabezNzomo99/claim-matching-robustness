(See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Mocha Uson wrong about federalism in Southeast Asia)\n\nThe 58-minute Aug. 2 video, a spliced version of which trended over the weekend and caused social media uproar, opens with her co-host, Drew Olivar, chanting \u201cPepe-dede-ralismo,\u201d punning \u201cfederalism\u201d and the Filipino words for female genitals and breasts.\n\nTen minutes in, Uson asked to Olivar to read aloud a supposed explainer on federalism. Olivar said:\n\nOf the three countries mentioned in the video, only the U.S. has a federal form of government. France and Singapore have unitary governments.\n\nThe European Committee of the Regions website describes France \u201ca unitary state organized on a decentralized basis.\u201d\n\nSingapore, a city-state, has no local government. A U.S. Library of Congress country profile calls it \u201ca unitary state with no second-order administrative divisions.\u201d\n\nFederal countries divide sovereignty between national and regional governments. Unitary countries have local governments that exercise only powers granted to them by the central government.\n\nSeveral senators and members of the consultative committee tasked to draft the federal charter have criticized Uson\u2019s video.\n\n\u201cDi ko lubos akalain na bababuyin pala nila ang kawsa ng pederalismo (I never expected they would savage the cause of federalism),\u201d said Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III in a statement, referring to Olivar\u2019s lewd dance. \u201cIlayo na si Mocha sa pederalismo (Put Mocha away from federalism).\u201d\n\nUson was earlier tapped by the consultative committee to help disseminate information on charter change.\n\nConsultative committee member Ranhilio Aquino, responding to former poll body commissioner Gregorio Larrazabal\u2019s Twitter post that the video is disturbing, said he is \u201cdisgusted.\u201d\n\nPalace Spokesperson Harry Roque in an Aug. 6 press briefing said the video did not have Duterte\u2019s blessing.\n\nResponding to the backlash, Uson said Aug. 5 the video was only for fun and does not intend to trivialize federalism.\n\n\u201cAng aming layunin ay hikayatin ang aming manonood na pag-usapan pa lalo ang pederalismo dahil ito ay isa sa mga pangako ng ating pangulo (Our goal is to urge viewers to discuss federalism, as it is one of the president\u2019s promises),\u201d Uson wrote.\n\nEuropean Committee of the Regions, Division of Powers\n\nInquirer.net, Koko to Mocha: Keep off federalism campaign, take a leave, Aug. 6, 2018\n\nUSA.gov, How the U.S. Government Is Organized\n\nPhilstar.com, Koko urges Mocha to go on leave after \u2018federalism\u2019 video, Aug. 6, 2018", "lang": "en"}
