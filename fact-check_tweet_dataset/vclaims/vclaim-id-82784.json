As The New York Times reported earlier in 2014, EPI does not have employees of its own; the PR firm \u201cbills\u201d EPI for the services that are provided, to the tune of $1.1 million in 2012.\n\nThe White House has pushed to increase the minimum wage, in three stages, from the current level of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 in 2016, and EPI has been one of the leading opponents against the plan, arguing the move will costs jobs.\n\nAs anyone who has studied Economics 101 knows, basic economic theory holds that higher employee costs means lower employment. But among economists, there is a sharp debate about the level of job loss, especially if the increase in the wage is minimal.\n\nIn February, the CBO weighed in and said in a report that a $10.10 minimum wage by 2016 would reduce employment by 500,000 workers because of two key reasons: consumers would buy fewer goods because of higher prices resulting from a minimum wage and because employers would hire fewer workers because the cost of labor has increased. (This is a net figure. Some workers would get hired because of an increased demand for goods and services from the newly-flush minimum wage workers.)\n\nIn effect, CBO said, \u201cabout 1.5 percent of the 33 million workers who otherwise would have earned less than $11.50 per hour would be jobless\u2014either because they lost a job or because they could not find a job\u2014as a result of the increase in the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nSo how does EPI get to claim \u201cup to 1 million jobs will be lost\u201d? That because it took the high end of the range that CBO also provided\u2014\u201cvery slight decrease to -1.0 million workers.\u201d\n\nThese are only estimates, and it\u2019s to CBO\u2019s credit that it indicates a possible range. But regular readers know that previously we have faulted politicians who have seized on the CBO\u2019s worst-case estimates. (In fact, in an accompanying radio ad, EPI cites the 500,000 figure.)\n\nWhile the TV ad claims that these jobs would be lost, it\u2019s worth remembering that this estimate is for two years in the future, so it includes jobs that have not been created yet. The CBO report also highlights the possible benefits of a minimum wage hike, such as pulling 900,000 people out of poverty.\n\nMichael Saltsman, EPI\u2019s research director, defended the phrasing. \u201cIt is an accurate way to describe the report,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the CBO report says that up to 1 million jobs will be lost, I think it is entirely fair game to put it in an advertisement.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the 30-second ad was focused on the job-loss aspects of the CBO report and thus there was no need to mention other aspects of the report. He asked: \u201cIs it worth losing up to 1 million jobs to pull 900,000 out of poverty?\n\nThe CBO report is political gold for opponents of a minimum-wage hike, so there really was no need to goose the results, especially if one of the ad\u2019s actors is going to wave an actual copy of the report. That visual image might fool viewers into believing the ad was telling the whole story about CBO\u2019s estimate.", "lang": "en"}
