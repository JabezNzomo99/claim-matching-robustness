Based on this, ANI reported that \u201cpassengers would be charged availing helicopters during rescue operations at the time of disasters.\u201d The story was also picked up by NDTV, Deccan Chronicle and India Times. NDTV later published another article with the Chief Minister\u2019s response.\n\nSocial media users did not take the news well and many tweeted in outrage, including former JNUSU Vice President Shehla Rashid and national social media in-charge of Indian Youth Congress Vaibhav Walia.\n\nUttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat took to Twitter to refute ANI\u2019s reportage. He said that in a government order dated July 4, clear directives were given to use the choppers for rescue at \u201cno cost to evacuees.\u201d\n\nThe order tweeted by the CM mentions \u2013 \u201cPeople stuck in a disaster will not be charged any rent, however, from Dharchula to Gunji in Pithoragarh, Rs 3,500 would be charged per normal passenger\u2026\u201d\n\nOn July 15, ANI tweeted the same notification as in its earlier article, clarifying that \u201cUttarakhand government has revoked this July 6 notification which charged passengers at the time of disasters.\u201d\n\nHowever, CM Rawat responded by saying that no such rent was ever charged in the first place.\n\nAlt News contacted CMO and was told the same by the personal assistant to the Chief Minister \u2013 passengers rescued during disasters were never charged any money.\n\nANI editor Ishaan Prakash responded to CM Rawat on Twitter that the subject line of the notification clearly states \u201cdues for helicopter help during disaster\u201d.\n\nHowever, Alt News closely read the July 6 notification, issued in Hindi, by the Civil Aviation Development Authority and found that the subject line of the letter does not read what was claimed by Prakash. It specifically talks about how much rent would normal passengers be charged for availing the services of disaster-relief helicopters stationed at Janpad-Pithoragarh and doesn\u2019t pertain to those being rescused. \u201cRegarding the rent charged to normal passengers for disaster relief helicopters stationed at Janpad-Pithoragarh,\u201d reads the subject line.\n\nThe body of the letter further mentions that the rent charged to normal passengers is being decreased, effective immediately. \u201cThe rate of rent charged to normal passengers is being decreased to Rs 2,500 and adding GST to the amount brings the total rent to Rs 3,100 per passenger,\u201d it says.\n\nNeither the subject line nor the body of the letter mentions the \u201ccharge for those stuck in a disaster\u201d or the \u201ccharge for evacuees being revoked.\u201d\n\nThe Uttarakhand government also released a press note on July 15, stating that claims on social media suggesting that the government is charging for helicopter services from disaster-affected people in Pithoragarh are misleading. The press note further adds that the helicopter service is being provided \u201cin view of the possibility of heavy rains.\u201d\n\nThis was also mentioned in a July 15 tweet by CM Rawat where he said, \u201cKeeping in mind monsoons in hilly regions, my government has rented two helicopters for Garhwal and Kumaon to be used immediately during disasters.\u201d\n\nMainstream media outlets with substantial readership should be more vigil about the content they publish. An instance of even modest misreporting not only affects their credibility but also misinforms the public.", "lang": "en"}
