The posts claim the guidelines were revealed by a \"Chinese doctor\" and helped China to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. But the recommended practices are misleading; health experts told AFP there is no scientific basis for many of the claims, which include using red-coloured soap and white handkerchiefs, as well as obtaining specific light bulbs.\n\nThe misleading claims were published on Facebook here on March 16, 2020. The post has been shared more than 17,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s lengthy caption, which is written in Sinhala, details a list of instructions that purportedly help control the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe new virus has killed more than 8,500 people and infected over 200,000 others worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nThe post also features an image with text translates as: \u201cThis is a valuable article revealed by a Chinese doctor on how China managed to control coronavirus so swiftly..\u201d\n\nIdentical posts were also shared on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nHowever, many of the recommendations are misleading.\n\nThe misleading posts did not cite a specific Chinese doctor or Chinese health authority; a keyword search in Chinese combining \"coronavirus\" and the alleged preventive measures in the posts also found no record of similar advice provided by health practitioners.\n\nWhile highlighting the importance of frequent handwashing, the post urges readers to \u201cFix a CFL bulb and keep it lit near taps constructed indoors. It is advisable to use red colored soap or liquid to wash hands\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) do emit UV light, which can be used at high intensities as a disinfectant, CFL bulbs emit very low levels of UV, as noted by the US Food & Drug Administration here. This makes them safe for daily use and renders them an ineffective disinfectant.\n\nDr. Ashan Pathirana, the registrar of Sri Lanka\u2019s Health Promotion Bureau (HPB), also said that installing CFL bulbs near water taps will not provide additional protection.\n\n\u201cThe installation of a CFL bulb will not help disinfect oneself from the novel coronavirus. There is no scientific basis behind the use of a CFL bulb to kill the novel coronavirus,\u201d Dr. Pathirana told AFP via phone on March 16.\n\nDr. Pathirana also refuted the claim that red-coloured soap is a more effective disinfectant than other types of soaps.\n\n\u201cThe red may be in reference to carbolic soap,\" he said. \"But soap or liquid soap nowadays may have a red colour due to a colorant. The advice to seek specifically red coloured soap is counterproductive. The point is to make it a habit to wash one\u2019s hands after being in a public location. For general hygiene it is advisable to wash hands with soap at least five times a day.\u201d\n\nThe misleading post also claims that the colour white has a \u201charmful\u201d impact on the virus.\n\n\u201cIf you can cover with a white handkerchief or tissue when sneezing or coughing, it will prevent the virus in the mucus from being transferred to others..\u201d the post reads.\n\nDr. Pathirana said: \u201cIt's good to use a tissue when sneezing or coughing but there is no reason to seek out white because colors of the tissue absolutely have no impact on the virus. The only way to ensure the tissue does not end up transferring the virus to others, is to dispose of it safely,\u201d he added.\n\nThe post also calls for the use of the elbow to cover a cough as the \u201cangle of the elbow\u201d will kill viruses faster.\n\n\u201cWe ask the public to use the elbow when sneezing or coughing in order to control the spread of droplets. The angle of the elbow has no impact on killing the virus,\u201d Dr. Pathirana noted.\n\nDr. Pathirana also urged the public to follow the \u201ctried-and-tested\u201d methods that have proven effective in minimising novel coronavirus infections including general hygiene practices and social distancing.\n\nHere are the safety guidelines issued by Sri Lanka's Ministry of Health.", "lang": "en"}
