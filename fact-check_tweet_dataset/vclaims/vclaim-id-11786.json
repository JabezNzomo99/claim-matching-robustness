Paolo Benigno \"Bam\" Aquino as a \u201ccredit-grabber.\u201d\n\nThe first is a Dec. 11 article on website insiderph.com which bore the headline:\n\nThe fabricated report, which carried grammatical errors, said the opposition senator gave no reply when asked about his supposed contribution to the bells\u2019 return during a \"senate interview\".\n\nThe same day, Facebook page The Filipino News posted a photo that purported to have come from the \"Office of Senator Bam Aquino.\" It showed an image of the senator juxtaposed with the statement:\n\nThere have been no official statements, press releases nor reports from mainstream media that reflect insiderph.com's claim. Likewise, neither Aquino's Facebook page nor his website has published the photo being shared by The Filipino News.\n\nIn a text message to VERA Files, the senator's office also debunked the online posts' claims.\n\n\"We have not released any statement or comment on this issue, nor has he been asked about it in an interview,\" it said.\n\nThe fake post was published the same day the historic Balangiga Bells were returned to the country 117 years after the U.S. Army took them as war booty from a church in Eastern Samar in 1901 during the Philippine-American War.\n\nTraffic to the fake news largely came from the pages Showbiz Government, Bayan Ko Ph, PRESIDENT RODY DUTERTE SUPPORTERS INTERNATIONAL, and The Filipino News, and could have reached more than one million people.\n\nInsiderph.com was created on Sept. 21; The Filipino News in October 2011.", "lang": "en"}
