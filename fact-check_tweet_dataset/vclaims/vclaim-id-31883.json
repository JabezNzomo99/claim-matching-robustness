Let\u2019s check the authenticity of these claims.\n\nWhen the image in the post is searched using reverse image search, we get the Prime Minister\u2019s address on the eve of new year on 31st December, 2016. He is seen in the same attire and the same background as is shown in the post. So it can be concluded that the image is an old one.\n\nFurther, the taxes & duties on alcohol is part of the state list in the 7th schedule of the constitution. In other words, the decision on alcohol ban or any such change in tax structure of alcohol has to be taken by the relevant state government and not the central government. Recently, Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, the new Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh promised a ban on alcohol in his manifesto for the assembly elections.\n\nTo sum it up, the Prime Minister did not announce a ban on alcohol. It is a photoshopped image.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
