First, he understated it. Then he wrongly described it as the highest among all local government units.\n\nThis is not the first time he got the city\u2019s financial figures wrong.\n\nAiring his frustration at a military general he fired in connection with the procurement of medicines and medical supplies for soldiers, Duterte recalled how he ran Davao City as mayor:\n\nDavao City\u2019s revenue growth rate in 2016, the year Duterte was elected president, stood at 10.24 percent, not 9 percent, data from the Commission on Audit\u2019s (COA) reports show.\n\nCOA revenue as the \u201cgross inflow of economic benefits or service potential during the reporting period when those inflows result in an increase in net assets/equity, other than increases relating to contributions from owners.\u201d Revenue can be loosely referred to as earnings.\n\nThe city\u2019s total reported revenue grew from P6.171 billion in to P6.803 billion the , making it the fifth highest earning city in the country in 2016, according to the latest available tally.\n\nIts revenue growth rate, however, is not the highest among LGUs, contrary to the president\u2019s claim.\n\nCOA\u2019s financial reports list the earnings of cities, provinces and municipalities separately. Para\u00f1aque posted the highest revenue growth rate at 19.02 percent in 2016. Davao was only second.\n\nEven if Duterte were referring to the city\u2019s 2015 revenue growth rate, he would still be wrong. \n\n\n\nDavao City\u2019s earnings grew 9.89 percent that year. It ranked last in terms of revenue growth rate among the nine cities with the highest reported revenues in 2015 that were also in the list.\n\nOn at least two other occasions, Duterte falsely claimed the city\u2019s economy had been growing by an \u201cunprecedented\u201d 9 percent (See and VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Is Davao City\u2019s economic growth unprecedented in the country\u2019s history? ).\n\n\n\nGovernment data on economic growth, however, are disaggregated by region, not by city. The president then must be referring to Davao Region\u2019s gross regional domestic product (GRDP) growth rate of 9.4 percent in , which is prominently featured in the official of Davao City\u2019s Investment Promotion Office.\n\nThe Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) uses GRDP, or \u201cthe aggregate of gross value added of all resident producer units in the region,\u201d as the indicator of economic growth.\n\nPCOO, Rodrigo Roa Duterte, Speech During the Dinner with the Philippine Military Academy Alumni Association, Inc ., Oct. 4, 2018", "lang": "en"}
