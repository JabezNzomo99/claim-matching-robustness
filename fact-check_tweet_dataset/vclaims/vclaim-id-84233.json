The posts claim the words were originally posted on Facebook by South Africa\u2019s former public standards watchdog Thuli Madonsela, who is widely admired for her role in fighting corruption. Madonsela has stressed that she didn\u2019t write the comments, which appear to have originated on a Facebook page for her supporters. Madonsela says she doesn\u2019t even have a Facebook account, and described the comments as \u201cderogatory racism against black people\u201d.\n\nNumerous versions of the post have been circulating on Facebook, all copying and pasting the same extensive post titled \u201cWORDS SO TRUE BY THULI MADONSELA\u201d. We\u2019ve archived one of the posts, which has racked up 38,000 shares since January, here.\n\nThe text goes on to claim that black people use racism as an excuse for failure and the inability to move forward is what holds them back -- unlike the apartheid Afrikaner nation which \u201cwas able to build themselves into a formidable nation\u201d.\n\nThe end of the post claims that the words were originally published by Madonsela on Facebook on January 23, 2018.\n\nIn older versions of the post, the same text is used but instead leads with, \u201cWilliam Mametsa with Thuli Madonsela posted on facebook\u201d as seen in this archived post from February 24, 2018.\n\nA Facebook search of the two names reveals numerous posts by a William Mametsa on a page called \u201cSupport PROF THULI MADONSELA & #AntiCorruption & #MobilisingOfSouthAfricans\u201d.\n\nOne of those posts bears strong similarities to the posts which later attributed such comments to Madonsela herself, and this appears to be where the misinformation started. The original post did not claim to be quoting Madonsela -- it was just posted on a page that supports her. It is dated January 23, 2018 -- the same date given for the supposed comments by her, in posts that have gone viral more recently.\n\nNewer versions of the post add a further line: \u201cCLIFTON BEACH - Judged purely on what you can see with the naked eye: Who are the hate driven racists in this picture?\u201d such as this post from January 1, 2019.\n\nA race row erupted in Cape Town over the festive period after a private security company allegedly ordered black beachgoers to vacate the popular Clifton beach -- read this AFP report for more.\n\nMadonsela tweeted to her more than a million followers in January that she was not on Facebook and requested that an unknown imposter to stop using her name to \"spew derogatory racism against black people\".\n\nOn the same day, Madonsela tweeted an opinion piece that she described as an example of her \u201cauthentic views on race and racism\u201d. The article contradicts the misleading post credited to her, arguing that the typical response to allegations of racism in South Africa is a deeply flawed one.", "lang": "en"}
