Moreover, the video was taken in Miami, USA and not in China.\n\nThe description of the video reads such: \u201cOur crew is in for a surprise when they begin the removal process of our clients' old roof and hundreds of bats come flying out from underneath the tiles. This was unexpected! (Bat Removal is not a service that we provide.)\u201d\n\nOn searching for the channel, we found that Istueta Roofing is a contractor based in South Florida in the US, which had undertaken this job in 2011. We also found the same video on their website.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the video has been shared with a false claim and has nothing to do with Coronavirus.\n\nReports earlier had said that there is a possibility that Coronavirus could have originated from bats, but the source of the same has not yet been confirmed.", "lang": "en"}
