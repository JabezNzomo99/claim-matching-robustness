While an order to return certain equipment was issued to allow for supplies to be reallocated to those who needed them most, it did not apply to troops deployed or likely to be deployed in the near future. Moreover, the unspent $2.3 billion was allocated for new projects, not costs of basic equipment.\n\nAccording to a Facebook post shared over 17,000 times since its publication in July, Canadian soldiers \u201cwere ordered to return their sleeping bags and rucksack,\u201d because Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government \u201cspent $2.3 billion less than planned on military gear.\u201d\n\nThe post is misleading. On May 28, 2018 the entire Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) received an order to return their rucksacks and sleeping bags so that they could be redistributed \u201cwhere it is needed most.\u201d However, the order did not apply to currently deployed CAF members, operational units, or those who could be deployed in the near future.\n\nPhilippe Le Bouthillier, spokesperson for the Department of National Defence, explained to AFP in an email that, \u201cThere are numerous personnel in the CAF that have, over the years, moved into positions that no longer need this type of equipment or deploy as often,\u201d hence the decision to recall some of the equipment.\n\nThe photo below shows a Canadian soldier in Mali wearing a rucksack on August 1, 2018, two months after the order was issued.\n\nIn 2017, the Liberal government introduced a long-term defence policy it calls \u201cStrong, Secure, Engaged\u201d. That year, $6.2 billion was earmarked for capital investments in defence, although only $3.9 billion was spent, as Minister of Defence Harjit Sajjan pointed out in May 2018 at CANSEC, a Canadian military industry conference.\n\nBouthillier told AFP that the Department of National Defence \u201cchose not to request $2.3 billion in capital funding last year, because we realized that we would not be able to spend the full amount.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the $6.2 billion was specifically meant for purchases and investments in new projects. The roughly 250 projects funded with this money can be searched on this website detailing the Defence Capabilities Blueprint.\n\n\u201cSleeping bags have nothing to do with the budget, because their cost was already accounted for,\u201d Jessica Lamirande, another communications officer for the Department of National Defense told AFP.\n\nThe Canadian Armed Forces ordered a redistribution of sleeping bags from CAF members unlikely to need them in the near future. The unspent $2.3 billion was allocated for new projects under Canada\u2019s new defence policy, and was unrelated to the military\u2019s costs for sleeping bags and rucksacks. Defense spokesman Le Bouthillier also told AFP that the CAF is in the process of buying new rucksacks and sleeping bags, though they will not be available until mid-2019.", "lang": "en"}
