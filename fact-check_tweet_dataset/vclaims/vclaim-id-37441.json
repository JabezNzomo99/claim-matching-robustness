OpIndia too put out an article based on the same claims\n\nBoth claims are false. While Manju, Dalit activist, is the state secretary of the Kerala Dalit Mahila Federation, she is not associated with the Congress. And she certainly is not Christian, but Hindu by religion. However, she did contest the 2010 local body elections on a Congress ticket on the insistence of the party. Speaking to The Quint, Manju said: \u201cI am not an active member of the Congress, but I did contest the 2010 local body elections in Cheruthala on a Congress ticket. I was approached by the party since I already had a following in the region owing to my association with the Dalit Federation.\u201d However, Manju lost the elections, thereby ending her association with the party. Meanwhile, the Dalit Federation is an independent organisation with no political affiliations, she clarified. In a televised debate on local news channel Mathrubhumi, representatives from the Congress party, too, denied Manju's supposed affiliations with the party.\n\nHOW DID MANJU ENTER THE SABARIMALA TEMPLE? As mentioned earlier, Manju dyed her hair grey in order to enter the temple and escape the protestors\u2019 notice. She also claimed that she did not seek police protection. The Kerala Police are yet to confirm Manju\u2019s visit. This was not Manju\u2019s first attempt to enter the Sabarimala. Earlier in October 2018, the activist tried to enter the shrine and was requested by the police to turn away, citing the area\u2019s tense situation as reason. On 2 January, two women \u2013 Bindu and Kanakadurga \u2013 had entered the sanctum sanctorum of the Sabarimala temple to offer prayers The shrine was closed for \u201cpurification rituals\u201d hours after the women entered the shrine. On 28 September 2018, the Supreme Court had lifted the ban on the entry of women of menstruating age (between 10-50) at the Sabarimala temple.", "lang": "en"}
