The clip began to circulate on social media:\n\nThis is a genuine image that was aired on Nickelodeon.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that all of the networks owned by ViacomCBS (including MTV, VHI, CMT, and Nickelodeon) went dark in honor of Floyd and in support of social justice.\n\nAt 5 p.m. on most Mondays, the cable landscape dominated by ViacomCBS is filled with familiar sights: Jim playing pranks on Dwight on \u201cThe Office\u201d; the host Rob Dyrdek mocking viral-video wannabes on \u201cRidiculousness,\u201d actor Tim Allen unsuccessfully trying to rule his roost on \u201cLast Man Standing.\u201d But viewers tuning in on this Monday were greeted with something different: a black screen with the words \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe,\u201d flashing in rhythm to the sounds of loud labored breathing. The piece, one-part tribute, one-part video art, honored George Floyd, the Minnesota man who died at the hands of police, and the national wave of Black Lives Matter protests his death jump-started. It lasted the same amount of time \u2014 8 minutes and 46 seconds \u2014 that police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. Ten ViacomCBS cable channels, including Comedy Central, MTV and CMT, carried the message.\n\nHere\u2019s a video of what aired on ViacomCBS networks for eight minutes and 46 seconds on June 1:\n\nWhile MTV, VH1, and ViacomCBS\u2019 other networks geared toward adults aired the above-displayed video, Nickelodeon itself appears to have opted for a message that was more directly aimed at children. Newsweek reported that the above-displayed video also aired on Nickelodeon, but we have not been able to confirm that.\n\nEven so, Nickelodeon did display a screen explaining that it was \u201cgoing off the air for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in support of justice, equality, and human rights\u201d followed by a message the network deemed a \u201cDeclaration of Kid\u2019s Rights\u201d that appeared on their social media pages. The social media message included the words, \u201cWe are all part of the change #blacklivesmatter.\u201d\n\nNickelodeon also shared a second message with the #blacklivesmatter hashtag:\n\nThis is not the first time that Nickelodeon has gone dark in support of a social justice cause. In 2018, the network went off air for 17 minutes in honor of the 17 students who were killed during a high school shooting in Parkland, Florida.", "lang": "en"}
