Bernie Sanders falsely claimed the Senate \u201crequires 60 votes for a Supreme Court nomination.\u201d It requires 51 votes. Sanders is referring to the 60 votes needed to pass a cloture motion to end a filibuster, and cloture votes on high court nominations are rare.\n\u2022 Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy left the false impression that \u201cevery current Supreme Court Justice cleared\u201d a 60-vote threshold. Justice Clarence Thomas did not receive 60 votes. In that case, there was no cloture vote, and Thomas was approved 52-48.\n\u2022 Republican Sen. John Barrasso claimed \u201cevery Supreme Court vote \u2026 for over 200 and some years, has been an up-or-down vote.\u201d That\u2019s misleading. Although rare, Supreme Court votes were preceded by cloture votes four times. One cloture motion failed.\n\u2022 Republican Sen. John Thune said there\u2019s \u201cnever been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.\u201d There was, however, a successful GOP-led filibuster of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s nominee for chief justice. Southern Democrats helped defeat that cloture motion.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is schedule to vote April 3 on President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court after a one-week delay at the request of the Democrats. The Republican-controlled committee is expected to approve the nomination at that time and send it to the full Senate for a final vote, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says will happen by April 7.\n\nThe Republicans have 52 votes in the Senate, just one more than required for Gorsuch to be approved. But the Democrats have threatened to filibuster the nomination. Typically, the Senate majority leader can end a filibuster by filing a cloture motion, which if approved would place a limit on the floor debate and set a time for a vote. But a cloture motion requires 60 votes and, in this case, that would require at least eight Democrats to cross the aisle and vote with the Republican majority.\n\nIt is this two-step voting process \u2014 which is rare for Supreme Court nominees \u2014 that is causing senators in both parties to spin the facts.\n\nSanders, the independent senator who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, frequently claims that the Senate rules \u201crequire\u201d 60 votes for a Supreme Court nominee. We wrote about an earlier instance of this, but the senator repeated it again in interviews on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on March 29 (at about the 5-minute mark) and CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on March 26.\n\nIn both cases, Sanders is referring to the 60-vote threshold that is required to pass a cloture motion and end a threatened filibuster. Sanders makes it seem like this is common practice, but it is not.\n\nThe Senate adopted the cloture rule in 1917. At that time, a cloture motion could not be used to end debate on presidential nominees, and it required the approval of two-thirds of the senators present in order to pass. The rule was expanded in 1949 to include presidential nominees, and it was changed again in 1975 to require three-fifths, or 60 votes, to pass, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nBut cloture motions have been filed only four times since 1949 on Supreme Court nominations. (See Table 4 of the CRS report.) It happened most recently in 2006, when President George W. Bush nominated Samuel Alito to the highest court. The cloture motion passed 72-25 on Jan. 30, 2006, and Alito was confirmed 58-42 a day later with four Democrats voting yes.\n\nIn arguing against Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, Sanders continually conflates the cloture motion (which requires 60 votes) with the nomination vote (which requires 51 votes). But a cloture vote is not required unless Democrats force one, as they did in 2006.\n\nMurphy, a Connecticut Democrat, declared his opposition to Gorsuch in a Facebook post that leaves a false impression regarding the level of Senate support for the current Supreme Court justices.\n\nMurphy wasn\u2019t in the Senate in 1991, but that year President George H.W. Bush\u2019s controversial nominee, Clarence Thomas, was approved to sit on the high court by a slim 52-48 margin. Despite their concern about Thomas\u2019 fitness to serve on the court, the Democrats did not attempt to filibuster his nomination, and the Republicans did not have to file a cloture motion.\n\nIn that case, the Senate Judiciary Committee was deadlocked 7-7 after days of hearings that included explosive allegations by Anita Hill that Thomas had sexually harassed her when he was her supervisor at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In voting 7-7, the committee sent Thomas\u2019 nomination to the Senate floor without recommendation.\n\nShortly before the Senate vote, there were articles at the time that said the Democrats were considering a filibuster \u2014 which would have meant the Republicans would have needed to get 60 votes to end the debate on the nomination. At a Sept. 27, 1991, hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch pointed out the irony of the Democrats using a filibuster to block an African American from the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cBefore I got here this morning, I even heard talk of a filibuster,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cNow, that would really \u2014 wouldn\u2019t that be just the greatest irony of all? The filibuster today is being used by both sides almost without care. But in the early days, I once felt that the filibuster was used solely in civil rights matters to stop the onward push for civil rights. Can you imagine liberals talking about filibustering the second black nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States of America? Shame.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the two parties reached an agreement to bring the nomination to the floor without requiring a cloture vote.\n\nMurphy spokesman Chris Harris objected to our characterization of the senator\u2019s Facebook post, saying the senator was \u201cvery careful\u201d in his wording. \u201cHe said \u2018moving [the] nomination forward\u2019 received the support of 60 Senators. That is 100% true,\u201d Harris told us in an email.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Thomas\u2019 nomination moved to the floor for a vote by unanimous consent. That means no senator objected to a floor vote, but Thomas did not have the support of 60 senators.\n\nUpdated, March 31: This article was updated to include a response from Sen. Chris Murphy\u2019s office, which objected to our characterization of the senator\u2019s remarks as \u201cfalse.\u201d We originally wrote that Murphy \u201cincorrectly said \u2018every current Supreme Court Justice cleared\u2019 a 60-vote threshold.\u201d We changed that to say \u201cMurphy left the false impression that \u2018every current Supreme Court Justice cleared\u2019 a 60-vote threshold.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats don\u2019t have a monopoly on spinning the Supreme Court vote. GOP Sens. John Barrasso and John Thune gave incomplete accounts of past votes on Supreme Court nominees.\n\nIn a CNN interview on March 29, Barrasso claimed \u201cevery Supreme Court vote in the United States Senate, for over 200 and some years, has been an up-or-down vote,\u201d while Thune in a floor speech a day earlier said, \u201cThere has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.\u201d\n\nWe will look at these claims together because they deal with the few times when cloture was invoked on a Supreme Court nomination.\n\nFirst, Barrasso is technically right that every Supreme Court vote has been an up-or-down vote \u2014 because, as we noted earlier, it takes 51 votes to approve any nomination, including those to the high court. However, as we also noted, there were four times when Supreme Court votes were preceded by cloture votes. They occurred in 1968, 1971, 1986 and 2006.\n\nIn three of the four cases, the cloture vote was successful, and the Supreme Court nominations were approved on a straight up-or-down vote. But it took 60 votes to get to an up-or-down vote, so it is misleading for Barrasso to suggest that it is unprecedented for the Democrats to demand 60 votes for Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to advance.\n\nThe one successful filibuster occurred in 1968, when President Johnson nominated Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas to be chief justice. Thune\u2019s office told us it did not count Fortas as a \u201csuccessful partisan filibuster,\u201d because Democrats and Republicans alike voted against cloture. That\u2019s true. But the opposition was led by the Republicans and joined by Southern Democrats who were critical of what they viewed as the liberal rulings of Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2019s court. The opposition was described by CQ Almanac as \u201cthe conservative coalition.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a quick recap, courtesy of CQ Almanac: On June 26, 1968, the day that Johnson made his appointment, a group of 19 Republican senators signed a letter opposing the nomination of Justice Fortas to replace the retiring Chief Justice Warren. As they did in 2016 when President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, the Republicans expressed the belief that a president in his last year in office should not be allowed to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.\n\n\u201cIt is the strongly held view of the undersigned that the next Chief Justice of the United States, and any nominees for vacancies on the Supreme Court should be selected by the newly-elected President of the United States, after the people have expressed themselves in November\u2019s elections,\u201d the 19 GOP senators wrote. \u201cWe will, therefore, because of the above principle, and with absolutely no reflection on any individuals involved, vote against confirming any Supreme Court nominations of the incumbent President.\u201d\n\nOpposition to Fortas grew after committee hearings brought to light some damaging information, including \u201cinvolvement of Fortas in White House affairs\u201d and disclosure of a $15,000 payment that the justice received from American University for a nine-week seminar on law. \u201cThe money had been raised by his former law partner from among five former business associates, one of whom had a son involved in a federal criminal case,\u201d CQ Almanac wrote.\n\nOn Oct. 1, 1968, the cloture motion on Fortas\u2019 nomination needed 59 votes \u2014 two-thirds of the senators voting that day \u2014 but it failed, 45-43, and President Johnson withdrew the nomination three days later at Fortas\u2019 request. The cloture vote was supported by 35 Democrats and 10 Republicans.\n\nThe Washington Post described Fortas\u2019 defeat as a \u201csuccessful 1968 GOP-led filibuster.\u201d The New York Times described the debate as \u201cpartisan and often bitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cJustice Fortas was criticized for his liberal opinions while a Justice, his continuing practice of advising President Johnson on policy matters, and for what a number of senators viewed as excesses of the Warren Court,\u201d the Times wrote. \u201cWhen his supporters in the partisan and often bitter debate, failed to end a filibuster, Justice Fortas asked that his name be withdrawn.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen to Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. If they are unable to get the 60 votes to end a filibuster, the Republicans could change the cloture rule to allow the motion to pass with 51 votes \u2014 the so-called nuclear option. It is unclear yet if the Republicans will do that. One thing is for sure: Both sides are spinning the facts.", "lang": "en"}
