One Twitter user compared the image to a \u201ctypical\u201d protest in Portland, Oregon: \u201cThis is a typical #PDX #Oregon #Portland #Portlandia protest in my home city; \u201cwe are protesting because #Trump is not mentally stable\u201d #Trump2020 deal with it snowflakes #tcot #LNYHBT #tlot #vets #NRA #TeaParty\u201d\n\nIn fact, this photograph does not depict a group of \u201cliberals,\u201d a protest against Donald Trump, nor an event that occurred in the United States.\n\nThis image was taken in June 2010 by Flickr user \u201cwozischra\u201d and captured a gay pride parade taking place in Berlin, Germany. In other words, this photograph has nothing at all to do with American politics and originated several years before Donald Trump became president of the United States.\n\nThe earliest posting of this meme that we could uncover dates from January 2018. At that time, the book Fire and Fury had raised new concerns over President Trump\u2019s mental fitness, stating that multiple members of the Trump administration were concerned that the chief executive\u2019s \u201cmental powers were slipping.\u201d This meme was possibly created in response to that claim.", "lang": "en"}
