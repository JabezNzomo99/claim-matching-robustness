She does not appear to own property in Boca Raton.\n\nThe claim that police raided Winfrey\u2019s home in Boca Raton for evidence of sex trafficking became one of Twitter\u2019s top trending topics Tuesday night. It has also appeared on Facebook, where a post featured images of a gated home blocked off with red tape.\n\n\u201cThe house of Oprah Winfrey in Boca Raton, Florida is being dis-assembled and checking the tunnels underground for child-sexual trafficking and other crimes against humanity!\u201d reads the post. \u201cAnd she happens to be a very closed friend of Harvey Weinstein.\u201d\n\nA Twitter user also remarked, \u201cLmaooo Oprah Winfrey got arrested for running sex ring I always knew she was dirty.\u201d (RELATED: Did A Florida Robber Use A Cough \u2018As A Weapon\u2019 Amid The Coronavirus Outbreak?)\n\nThe viral claim, however, has no merit. An internet search only turned up credible news outlets debunking the notion that she had been arrested in connection with a sex trafficking ring and her home had been raided.\n\nWinfrey took to Twitter to address the claim that originated in a QAnon conspiracy theory that had surfaced online, according to the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cJust got a phone call that my name is trending. And being trolled for some awful FAKE thing,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s NOT TRUE. Haven\u2019t been raided, or arrested. Just sanitizing and self distancing with the rest of the world. Stay safe everybody.\u201d\n\nThe Boca Raton Police Department also denied she had been arrested.\n\n\u201cThe social media stories trending about @oprah being arrested by @bocapolice is absolutely false,\u201d the department tweeted.\n\nWinfrey does own, among other properties, a sprawling horse farm in Montecito, California, and a multimillion dollar vacation home in Telluride, Colorado, according to E! News. However, property records for Palm Beach County, where Boca Raton is located, do not show Winfrey having any homes in the area.\n\nThe home featured in the Facebook post is currently listed for sale under Premier Estate Properties. Its listing on Zillow does not have Winfrey as the owner and puts the home\u2019s value at $7,950,000.\n\n\u201cFake news,\u201d Carmen DiAngelo, the listing agent for the property, told the Daily Caller in a phone interview. \u201cThat is incorrect information.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
