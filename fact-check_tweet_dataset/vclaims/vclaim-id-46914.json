The woman is being ridiculed for wrapping the bandage over her hijab, indicating that she is faking her injury. On December 30, Abhijat Mishra, National General Secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, tweeted, \u201cDo not be afraid, it is a good thing \u2026 but first, tell which doctor wrapped the bandage over the hijab. There is a limit to lie as well. #IndiaSupportsCAA (Translated from \u0924\u0941\u092e \u0928\u093e \u0921\u0930\u094b \u0905\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0924 \u0939\u0948\u2026 \u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0947 \u092f\u0947 \u092c\u0924\u093e\u0913 \u0915\u093f \u0935\u094b \u0915\u094c\u0928 \u0938\u093e \u0921\u0949\u0915\u094d\u091f\u0930 \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u093f\u0938\u0928\u0947 \u0939\u093f\u091c\u093e\u092c \u0915\u0947 \u090a\u092a\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0902\u0927 \u0926\u0940, \u092e\u0924\u0932\u092c \u0939\u0926 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u091d\u0942\u0920 \u0915\u0940 !! #IndiaSupportsCAA)\u201d\n\nOn December 31, Swami Nishchalanandtweeted the same image and said, \u201cSuch a hurry to appear before TV camera that this \u2018fake\u2019 activist got a \u2018fake\u2019 bandage wrapped over her hijab\u2026 or was it a madarsa-trained \u2018doctor\u2019 who did it?\u201d\n\nOn January 2, Kuljeet Singh Chahal, general secretary BJP-Delhi, tweeted the same image along with the text posted by Mishra. This post was retweeted and liked more than 2,000 and 9,000 times respectively. Chahal\u2019s tweet was later quote-tweeted by Paresh Rawal, actor and former BJP MLA, who said, \u201cThe doctor who did this must-have bandage on his eye too!

Rawal\u2019s tweet received over 15,000 likes and more than 3,000 retweets.\n\nSubsequently, several users have shared the same post on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nTaking a closer look at the viral image, a watermark at the bottom left is spotted that reads \u2018Zafar Abbas.\u2019 Abbas is a New Delhi-based journalist who had shared the image on December 29.\n\nOn January 1, Abbas responded to Nishchalanand on Twitter and said, \u201cDear Sanyasi Sherlock Holmes, I clicked this pic. You are misguiding people. This bandage was tied in solidarity with Minhajuddin, a Jamia student who lost an eye in a police crackdown on Dec 15. Here are some more pic..See thread below!\u201d\n\nThe five-part thread was posted on December 29 by Abbas. In the opening thread, Abbas tweeted, \u201cEye bandaged : Jamia students bandage one eye in solidarity with fellow student Minhajuddin who lost an eye in @DelhiPolice crackdown on December 15. Innovative way of protest.\u201d The viral image was a part of the fifth tweet in the thread.\n\nOn December 29, several media outlets including NDTV and Zee Media, addressed the rally as the \u2018one eye bandaged\u2019 protest. The symbolic protest was held to express solidarity with a Jamia Millia Islamia student who lost his eye in an alleged police crackdown on December 15.\n\nAlt News spoke with Abbas who was covering the protests. He said, \u201cNot just the students, even the civilians joined the unique protest. Several individuals could be seen distributing bandages.\u201d He uploaded a four-minute Facebook Live as well.\n\nOn December 29, Surabhi Kanga, web editor at Caravantweeted a few photos from the protest. In one of the protests, we can clearly see an image where a person is tieing a bandage. Therefore, the claim on social media that protestors are \u2018faking\u2019 injuries because their bandages are wrapped over their hijab is untrue. The viral image was posted by New-Delhi based journalist Zafar Abbas from the \u2018one eye bandaged\u2019 protest on December 29. This was a symbolic agitation against alleged police brutality which caused a Jamia student to lose an eye.
