The Italian wildlife recovery center that examined the dead birds said they died from traumatic injuries sustained when the tree they nested in fell during a storm.\n\nThe photos show hundreds of dead birds lying on the street in Italy, with the Facebook caption claiming they died \u201cbecause of fucking corona viruse [sic] or fucking corporate 5g network.\u201d\n\nAs of press time, the new coronavirus has sickened over 2.68 million people in 184 countries and regions, including some 189,900 cases in Italy, per the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Online conspiracy theories link the spread of the virus to the proliferation of 5G networks, but the World Health Organization, Check Your Fact and others have thoroughly debunked the notion.\n\nThere is no evidence that COVID-19 or 5G technology killed the pictured birds. The photos come from the Italian news website Roma Today\u2019s Feb. 4 article describing how strong winds in Rome downed a tree the night before, injuring one person and killing a group of birds that made their nests in it.

None of the dead birds that CRFS Lipu Roma examined showed signs of intoxication or poisoning, and the live birds that they treated were healthy apart from injuries, according to the wildlife recovery center\u2019s Facebook post.\n\n\u201cMany people ask us what could have happened and the most likely hypothesis is that the wind, very strong, which was already swaying the branches of the tree, made the hundreds of sleeping animals laid on it lose their sense of direction and probably they didn\u2019t sense they were falling along with the tree,\u201d reads a rough translation of the post. \u201cIf we also consider that it was dark and the animals were still sleeping it\u2019s normal that they were caught off guard by such an unexpected event.\u201d\n\nBecause CRFS Lipu Roma found that the birds actually died from traumatic injuries, and no evidence could be found to support the claim that the birds were killed by coronavirus or 5G technology, we rate this claim as false.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
