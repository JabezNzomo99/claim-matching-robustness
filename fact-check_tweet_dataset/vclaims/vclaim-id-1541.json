In the formal assertion of Russian control over Crimea signed by President Vladimir Putin, Crimean-Tatar was designated one of three \u201cstate languages\u201d on the peninsula, alongside Russian and Ukrainian. Prior to the annexation, the language spoken by the minority Turkic inhabitants of the Black Sea peninsula had been designated a \u201cregional language\u201d under a controversial 2012 language law enacted by the Ukrainian government.\n\nBut many Crimean Tatars -- a majority of whom opposed Russia\u2019s takeover of the peninsula -- say this recognition remains largely symbolic, and that it is outweighed by what they call a campaign of systematic repression against the minority ethnic group under Moscow\u2019s rule.\n\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a June 2015 report that \u201ccontrol of the media in Crimea was tightened\u201d in the preceding months, including several outlets publishing and broadcasting in the Crimean-Tatar language. Russian media regulators, the report noted, had registered 30 media outlets using the Crimean-Tatar language but had denied licenses to the most popular television network and newspaper serving the Crimean-Tatar community on the peninsula.\n\nThe U.S. State Department called this shutting down of several Crimean Tatar language media in Crimea part of \"yearlong crusade to silence the Crimean Tatar population and others who oppose Russia\u2019s occupation.\"\n\nThe number of schoolchildren studying the Crimean-Tatar language in Crimea has also slipped slightly compared to the last year prior to the annexation, according to official Russian government data cited in the Russian media.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been instances of courts in Russia-controlled Crimea being either unable or unwilling to conduct proceedings in the Crimean-Tatar language. Zair Smedlyaev, the chairman of the Central Election Commission of the Crimean Tatar Assembly (Qurultay), wrote on Facebook in October that a judge illegally refused to conduct a court proceeding involving a prominent Crimean-Tatar community leader.\n\nLemara Selendili, a former deputy minister of education, sport, and youth affairs on the peninsula under both Ukrainian and Russian control, told a pro-Russian Crimean-Tatar television network in June that it\u2019s \u201cnot enough\u201d to just declare that Crimean-Tatar is a state language.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest: The Crimean-Tatar language over the (past two) years has not flourished, and it has not become any more common in the educational sphere,\u201d said Selendili, a Crimean-Tatar who has stated she was in favor of Crimea being incorporated in to Russia.", "lang": "en"}
