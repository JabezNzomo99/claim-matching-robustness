The claim is false; the photo has been doctored to include the message about the extradition bill.\n\nThe photo was published in this Instagram post on September 5, 2019.\n\nIt shows members of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), a pro-Beijing political party in Hong Kong, sitting in front of a yellow backdrop with the party\u2019s logo and the message: \u201csuccess in seeking government withdrawal of extradition law amendment bill\u201d written on it.\n\nThe traditional Chinese language caption accuses the DAB of being \u201cunbelievably disgraceful\u201d; the post was uploaded alongside multiple hashtags such as #DAB, #antiELAB, #HongKongpolice and #LiberateHongKongRevolutionofOurTimes.\n\nOn September 4, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced she would withdraw the bill, which would have allowed the extradition of some suspects in Hong Kong to mainland China. The bill has sparked three months of protests and violent clashes in the city. Here is an AFP report about the developments.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe photo has also been shared here on Twitter, here on Instagram and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo has been doctored with the message added to a photo of a DAB press conference held in July 2019.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the original photo published in this press release on the DAB\u2019s website on July 30, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo:\n\nOnly the DAB logo can be seen on the plain, yellow backdrop.\n\nThe DAB said in this Facebook post published on September 5 that the photo in the misleading post was a \u201cfake online image\u201d.\n\nThe September 4 press conference was also streamed live here on the DAB\u2019s official Facebook page. The video is embedded below.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and screenshots of the July 30 (C) and September 4 (R) DAB press conferences:\n\nHong Kong fact-checking group Kauyim Media also debunked the same photo here.", "lang": "en"}
