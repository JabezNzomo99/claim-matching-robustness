Pradhan, who is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is no stranger to misinformation. A compilation of such instances can be read here.\n\nThe screenshot tweeted by Gaurav Pradhan is misleading as the statement credited to Mamata Banerjee is incomplete. We found a LIVE video of the \u2018United India\u2019 rally shared by Banerjee\u2019s official Facebook page.\n\nAt 3:55:24 mins in the video, while speaking in Hindi, Banerjee said, \u201c\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0917 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0939\u0948 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0942, \u0908\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0939\u0948 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928, \u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0939\u0948 \u0908\u0938\u093e\u0908, \u0938\u093f\u0916\u094b \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0939\u0948 \u092c\u0932\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0928, \u092f\u0939 \u0939\u0948 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 (Sacrifice is a synonym for Hindu, faith is a synonym for Muslims, love is a synonym for Christians, martyrdom is synonym for Sikhs. This is our beloved India.-translated)\u201d. Moreover, the screengrab belongs to a live NDTVbroadcast of the United India rally. This claim was earlier debunked by India Today.\n\nNot just Urdu script at the rally\n\nA Twitter handle @mirchagalib tweeted two images of the same rally where all the opposition leaders were holding hands in a chain formation. In the second image, a logo of All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) written in Urdu was focused on. The claim suggests that Urdu scripts will \u2018take over\u2019 neighbourhood shop signs, if PM Modi is not elected back to power.\n\nHowever, Alt News found that the image of opposition leaders holding and raising hands to show unity was mischievously cropped. The stage also had AITC\u2019s logo in other languages such as English and Hindi. The claim was earlier debunked by an individual Twitter user, @Pun_Starr.\n\nIn conclusion, Mamata Banerjee\u2019s statement was based on an out-of-context screen grab from a longer broadcast to mislead social media users. Then, a cropped image of the United India rally\u2019s stage was used to suggest that opposition leaders will promote only Urdu across India, if voted to power. Earlier, a doctored video of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal with the claim that Modi and Amit Shah will ruin Pakistan if voted back to power, was circulated on social media.", "lang": "en"}
