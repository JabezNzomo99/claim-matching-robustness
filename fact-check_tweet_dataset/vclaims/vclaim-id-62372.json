As per their claim, a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was killed by \u201cextremists\u201d in Kumbakonam municipality in Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu. This tweet has been retweeted over 3,000 times (archived link).\n\n\n\nSimilarly, several Twitter and Facebook users shared the image along with same text, \u201cSwayamSevak\u2019sfathermurderedbyextremist In Kumbakonam\u201d. Some users have added a communal angle to the claim (archived link). Twitter user @AnitaShivyogi tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah and wrote, \u201cThis is unacceptable! Naxals and Jihadis are carrying out these murders of @RSSorg members and Hindu Sadhus. Are police and judiciary incapable of dealing with this one-sided violence? We haven\u2019t forgotten the Palghar lynchings yet\u201d (archived link).\n\nAnother user @singhakh who identifies as a swayamsevak also claimed that the RSS worker was killed at the entrance of the Kumbakonam Perumal temple because he opposed the temple\u2019s takeover and illegal sand mining.\n\nBharatiya Hindu Parivar Tamil Nadu went a step further and claimed that the man in the viral image was assassinated by the terrorists during a pro-CAA protest at Nachiyar Temple in Kumbakonam. As per this post, the man in the viral image is 65-year old Gopalakrishnan (archived link).\n\n\n\nAlt News was able to access a copy of the FIR which states that Gopalan was stabbed by Saravanan on June 30 at 9.20 pm because of a property dispute.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the murder of an RSS worker over a properly dispute was communalised on social media. The accused is a BJP member from the same community yet the incident has sparked an anti-Muslim wave. Furthermore, opponents of the Citizenship Act are also being falsely blamed for the murder.", "lang": "en"}
