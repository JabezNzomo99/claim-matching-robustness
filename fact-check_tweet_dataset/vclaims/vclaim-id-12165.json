Nancy Pelosi invoked Republican President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018If we ever close the door to new Americans, our leadership role in the world will soon be lost,'\u201d she recalled Jan. 3, citing remarks he made in 1989.\n\nWeeks later, social media users spread a different quote attributed to Reagan \u2014 this one about Pelosi.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi is extremely evil, she comes from the Baltimore democrat corruption machine the D\u2019Alesandro family, both her father Tom D\u2019Alesandro and her brother Tommy D\u2019Alesandro were mayors of Baltimore, a well oiled corrupt democrat family,\u201d the supposed quote reads.\n\nWe could find no proof that Reagan made such a remark, which was shared in a popular Facebook meme and on Twitter. Searches for that text show no trace of that quote\u2019s existence prior to the social media posts.\n\nMelissa Giller, chief marketing officer at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, pointed us to the Reagan Presidential Library website, which, among other things, includes statements, speeches and papers from the 40th president\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve searched every speech President Reagan gave,\u201d she told FactCheck.org in an email. \u201cHe never once mentioned Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\nPelosi was a freshman congresswoman during Reagan\u2019s second term; she was first elected to Congress in 1987.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nGiller, Melissa.
