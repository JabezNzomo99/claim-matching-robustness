There was no such holiday in 2019.\n\nAnd since there\u2019s change, there must be blame.\n\nIn posts on Twitter and Facebook, the Wisconsin Assembly GOP pointed the finger at the state\u2019s new Democratic governor.\n\n\"Last year, Republicans gave part of Wisconsin's budget surplus back to the taxpayers by instituting a sales tax holiday on some back-to-school items,\" the Aug. 27, 2019, posts said. \"You won't see that this year under Governor (Tony) Evers, despite the continued surplus.\"\n\nA graphic accompanying the text stamped the word \"CANCELED\" across a description of the sales tax holiday categories.\n\nThe Twitter version of the post was retweeted by several Republican legislators, including Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna.\n\nSo, did Evers really cancel the sales tax?\n\nGov. Scott Walker introduced a sales tax holiday in his budget for 2017, but GOP lawmakers voted to kill it.\n\nIn 2018, lawmakers went through various versions of a sales tax holiday early in the year. The Assembly approved a bill in February that would have created a $50 million sales tax holiday on all goods under $100.\n\nBut an amendment introduced in March by Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, limited the sales tax holiday to specific school-related categories. They included clothing and school supplies under $75 per item and computers under $750.\n\nThat version passed both houses and was signed into law by Walker. It reduced the expected consumer savings (and, therefore, lost state revenue) to about $14 million, according to an estimate from the state\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\n\nIt made Wisconsin one of 17 states with a sales tax holiday in 2018, according to the Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank.\n\nBut Republicans were explicitly clear that this was a one-time deal.\n\nThe statutory language included a note that \"This subsection does not apply in 2019 or in any year thereafter.\"\n\nAnd Walker\u2019s veto message (which didn\u2019t change the nature of the holiday) also noted the holiday \"will not recur in future years.\"\n\nThis year, Republicans \u2014 who still control the state Legislature \u2014 never proposed a sales tax holiday, noted Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback.\n\n\"Republicans specifically prevented the 2018 back-to-school holiday from being offered in 2019 and any year thereafter,\" she said in an email. \"If Republicans wanted to extend the 2018 back-to-school sales tax holiday, they would have had to pass legislation this year to do so.\"\n\nAdam King, director of social media for the Assembly Republican Caucus, pointed to an Evers quote as evidence supporting the post\u2019s claim.\n\n\"Parents are going to be out there purchasing their kids' supplies whether they have an incentive or not,\" Evers said at a July 29, 2019, press conference. \"I just don\u2019t think the incentive actually worked.\"\n\nSaid King: \"By making this statement, the governor effectively shut the door on any possibility that a tax holiday could be implemented this year.\"\n\nBut that timeline defies logic. If Republicans wanted a sales tax holiday, they would have introduced the measure months before that comment. Certainly before the Legislature passed the final version of the budget in late June.\n\nAs a quick aside, Evers\u2019 comment does appear to misconstrue the intent of the sales tax holiday \u2014 Republicans intended it as tax relief in the wake of a General Fund surplus, and his comment treated it as an economic incentive.\n\nA 2018 study from the Tax Foundation found sales tax holidays don\u2019t promote economic growth, they just shift the timing of purchases. It called the holidays \"political gimmicks\" that \"distract policymakers and taxpayers from genuine, permanent tax relief.\"\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t play into the veracity of this claim.\n\nYou can\u2019t cancel something that was expressly created as a one-time occurrence.\n\nRepublicans could have introduced a new bill creating another sales tax holiday this year, but they didn\u2019t. And Evers\u2019 comments showing a lack of support for such a measure didn\u2019t come until months after Republicans would have needed to broach the subject.", "lang": "en"}
