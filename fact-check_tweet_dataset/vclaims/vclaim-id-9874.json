They are now mad that our census, which for years and years and years, decades, has asked, \u2018Are you a citizen of the United States of America?\u2019 \u2013 they are mad that the census asks that simple question.\"\n\nHas the citizenship question that is now at the center of a debate already been asked for \"years and years and years\"?\n\nThe history section of the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s web page notes that the first U.S. census was taken in 1790. At that time the questions asked for the name of the head of the family and the number of persons in each household, including slaves.\n\nAs part of its announcement, the Commerce Department said that citizenship questions have been included on prior censuses:\n\nBetween 1820 and 1950, almost every decennial census asked a question on citizenship in some form. Today, surveys of sample populations, such as the Current Population Survey and the ACS (American Community Survey), continue to ask a question on citizenship.\n\nAccording to our colleagues at PolitiFact National, the last time all households were asked about U.S. citizenship was in the 1950 Census. That census questioned where individuals were born, and \"if foreign-born \u2014 is he naturalized?\"\n\nIn 1960, the census only asked about place of birth.\n\nFrom 1970 to 2000, the Census Bureau used two questionnaires: a long-form and short-form.\n\nMost households received the short-form questionnaire, which covered basic questions, while about 1 in 6 households received a long-form questionnaire that included a question on citizenship.\n\nThe 2010 Census, the most recent one, only used a short-form questionnaire with 10 questions. None of those related to citizenship.\n\nHowever, in the mid-2000s the Census Bureau began gathering demographic and socioeconomic information through the American Community Survey, or ACS. The survey collects information from about 3.5 million households a year and asks about citizenship status.\n\nThe ACS asks such questions as \"In what U.S. state, territory, commonwealth or foreign country was this person born?\" Another question is \"Is this person a CITIZEN of the United States?\"\n\nThe idea with both the now-defunct long-form and the ongoing ACS survey is to use a large sample of responses to draw conclusions about the population as whole, much as a poll does not need to contact every voter to be considered valid.\n\nMcDaniel said the census \"for years and years and years, decades, has asked, \u2018Are you a citizen of the United States of America?\u2019\"\n\nThe last time all households were asked about U.S. citizenship was in the 1950 census. But in the decades since, some version of the question has been asked in nearly every census -- either through the now-defunct \"long form\" or the ongoing annual surveys.\n\nThe 2020 census calls for asking all households the citizenship question.\n\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate McDaniel\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
