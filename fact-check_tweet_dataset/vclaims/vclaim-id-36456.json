Not only did his career span 27 seasons, but he was still throwing fastballs in the 100-mph range well into his 40s. When Ryan retired from the sport at the age of 46, he had racked up not only 324 wins, but also lifetime records for most strikeouts (5,714) and most no-hitters (seven). However, one of the most enduring and iconic images of Ryan stems not from his record-setting achievements, but from an on-field brawl that occurred at the tail end of his playing days.\n\nOn Aug. 4, 1993, in one of the last handful of games that Ryan ever played, he plunked Chicago White Sox third baseman Robin Ventura on the back with a pitch. An incensed Ventura took a few steps towards first base and then dropped his bat, threw down his helmet, and charged at the pitcher\u2019s mound. Despite the 20-year difference in their ages (Ryan was 46, Ventura just 26), Ryan stood his ground, grabbed Ventura in a headlock, and hit Ventura in the head multiple times with his fist:\n\nThis, then, is one of the most enduring images of Ryan\u2019s long career \u2014 the Texas Rangers pitcher pummeling a head-locked Ventura, while his catcher, Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez, tries to intercede in the scuffle:\n\nBut there\u2019s another enduring \u2014 and even tougher \u2014 image of Ryan out there, one that shows him preparing for his next pitch in a blood-spattered uniform, with rivulets of blood running down from his mouth:\n\nThis picture of what looks like a vampire who just broke off from a snack to come in and throw an inning or two of relief is often touted as a testament to Ryan\u2019s no-nonsense, workmanlike approach and dedication to pitching \u2014 the personification of the \u201cold school\u201d baseball maxim that \u201cif a bone ain\u2019t showin'\u201d you shake off an injury, stay on the field, and play through it.\n\nAlthough this photograph is undeniably real, its common association with the Ryan-Ventura fight is erroneous. No blood was spilled in that brawl, and this picture was not taken in the aftermath of that scuffle \u2014 rather, it stemmed from a different incident that had taken place three years earlier.\n\nIn the second inning of a Sept. 8, 1990, game between Ryan\u2019s Texas Rangers and the Kansas City Royals, designated hitter Bo Jackson of the Royals smacked a sharp one-hopper back to the mound that Ryan wasn\u2019t able to field cleanly. The ball deflected off the pitcher\u2019s glove and hit him in the face, opening a two-inch gash in his lower lip that required six stitches to close after the game:\n\nNonetheless, Ryan calmly picked up the ball, threw Jackson out at first, and resumed pitching without leaving the field, seeking assistance from the team trainer, or even toweling the blood off his face. Ryan threw seven innings of shutout ball that evening before finally coming out of the game with a 1-0 lead after walking the leadoff batter in the eighth inning.\n\nAlthough the Rangers eventually won the game, credit for the victory went not to Ryan but to Texas relief pitcher Kenny Rogers:\n\nNolan Ryan didn\u2019t know which hurt worse \u2014 getting hit in the mouth with a batted ball or pitching a three-hitter for seven innings and not getting win No. 303. \u201cNeither one was very pleasant,\u201d baseball\u2019s all-time strikeout and no-hit king said after the Texas Rangers edged the Kansas City Royals 2-1 last night on Rafael Palmeiro\u2019s run-scoring double in the bottom of the ninth. \u201cI\u2019ve had line drives off my head. Pitch as long as I have and a lot of things happen to you,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut I never got one square in the mouth, never had one cut me where I had to be stitched up.\u201d The injury occurred in the second inning when Bo Jackson\u2019s sharp one-hopper caromed off Ryan\u2019s glove and split his lower lip, which required six stitches after the game. Despite the injury, he kept pitching, striking out eight. He was relieved by Kenny Rogers after walking Bill Pecota to start the eighth with a 1-0 lead. Ryan said the injury \u201cwasn\u2019t really ever a factor\u201d in his coming out. \u201cIt was so humid \u2026 that had more of a bearing. Whatever happens during the game, you have to put out of your mind. It did take me a couple of hitters to get my rhythm back.\u201d It shook him up,\u201d Manager Bobby Valentine said. \u201cHe was mad he didn\u2019t catch the ball. That was a 2-inch-wide cut.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
