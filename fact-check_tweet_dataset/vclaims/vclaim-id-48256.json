The government has yet to issue any statement on Beijing's latest move.\n\nOn March 25, 2019, or more than a year ago, Philnews.ph published \u201cJUST IN: Malaca\u00f1ang Admits West Philippine Sea Controlled By China.\u201d The write-up was heavily based on an Inquirer.net report earlier that day headlined \u201cPalace admits China controls West PH Sea.\u201d This followed the release of a video where Filipino fisherfolk spoke about being harassed by the Chinese in Scarborough Shoal.\n\nLast April 18, China\u2019s Ministry of Civil Affairs released a statement on its two \u201cnew districts\u201d and shortly after, Philnews.ph\u2019s year-old article made the rounds again on Facebook (FB), with the publishing date misleadingly changed to April 19, 2020. The website, which has a history spreading disinformation online, did not update its write-up and still used the phrases \u201cJust In\u201d and \u201cBreaking News.\u201d\n\nMalaca\u00f1ang and the Foreign Affairs Department have kept mum about the formation of the \u201cXisha District\u201d on Paracel Islands and \u201cNansha District\u201d on the Spratly Island Group. China has stationed the \u201cPeople\u2019s Government of Nansha District\u201d at the Kagitingan Reef which is part of the Philippines\u2019 Kalayaan Island Group in the Spratlys.\n\nVietnam, one of several countries with territorial claims in the Paracel Islands, has lodged a formal protest against the establishment of the new districts. Retired Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario have also urged the Duterte administration to file a diplomatic protest against China's two new districts in the disputed waters.\n\nPhilnews.ph\u2019s article has been reposted more than 60 times on social media since its original publishing in 2019. It has gained over 114,000 interactions on FB and could have reached almost two million netizens. FB page Philippine Trending News - PhilNews and FB public groups SEN TRILLANES POWER and THE RESISTANCE - FILIPINO DISSENTING VOICES AGAINST DUTERTE REGIME are its top traffic generators after it resurfaced four days ago.\n\nPhilnews.ph has been posting stories since December 2010.", "lang": "en"}
