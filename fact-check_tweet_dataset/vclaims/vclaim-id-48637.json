By day six, all of them had been cleared of coronavirus, compared with 57.1% of patients who got hydroxychloroquine alone, and 12.5% of those who were in the control group and got neither drug.\n\nBut the authors noted their work had drawbacks, \"including a small sample size, limited long-term outcome follow-up, and dropout of six patients from the study.\"\n\nThe French study was published a week after an in vitro study was published in the Journal of Infectious Disease. It looked at the impact of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in \"controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\"\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is another name for COVID-19. Cytokines are cell-signaling molecules that stimulate the movement of cells toward areas of inflammation or infection.\n\nThough chloroquine has been used sporadically in Wuhan, China, where COVID-19 was first identified late last year, the authors speculated that hydroxychloroquine might yield similar results since its mechanism of action is the same. They added that, since it has a more tolerable safety profile, it could prove preferable to chloroquine.\n\nThe authors compared the pharmacological activity of the two drugs in vitro and found that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine in inhibiting the coronavirus.\n\nBut that does not mean that either of the drugs could prove useful in people. The history of medical science is littered with examples of in vitro results that failed to be replicated in vivo.\n\nStill, given that no treatment has proven successful in treating COVID-19 infection, the prospect of an effective treatment was a topic at Friday's White House press briefing, too.\n\nAsked whether hydroxychloroquine had shown promise as a potential preventive therapy, the nation's top infectious disease doctor was adamant.\n\n\"The answer is no,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, adding that the only evidence is anecdotal.\n\nNone of the evidence has been collected through a controlled clinical trial, \"so you really can't make any definitive statement about it,\" Fauci said.\n\nThat didn't stop Trump from weighing in with an opposing view. \"It was fairly effective on SARS,\" he said, referring to Severe Acute Respiratory Disease, which affected 8,000 people in 26 countries in 2003.\n\nFauci was unbowed. \"You've got to be careful when you say fairly effective,\" he said. \"It was never done in a clinical trial that compared it to anything. It was given to individuals who felt that maybe it worked.\"\n\nThe lack of scientific evidence about the drug's efficacy against coronavirus has not stopped the U.S. government from stocking up on the drug. \"We have millions of units ordered,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked whether his positive spin on the drugs could give Americans a false sense of optimism, the president shot back:\n\nFauci then sought to minimize his apparent differences with the president. \"It might be effective,\" he said about the drug. \"I'm not saying that it isn't. It might be effective. But, as a scientist, as we're getting it out there, we need to do it in a way, while we are making it available for people who might want to hope that it might work, we're also collecting data that will ultimately show that it's truly effective and safe under the conditions of COVID-19.\"\n\nAsked whether he had reason to believe the drug is not safe when used against COVID-19, Fauci noted that all drugs have toxicities. Those associated with chloroquine have proven to be rare and largely reversible during the decades that it has been used against malaria, he said, but that's not the final word.\n\n\"What we don't know is, when you put it in the context of another disease, whether it's safe,\" he said. \"Fundamentally, I think it probably is going to be safe, but I like to prove things first.\"\n\n(Editors' Note: Since this story was first published, the Food and Drug Administration has issued strong warnings against the use of chloroquine and hydrochloroquine after poisonings and even death from the drugs.
