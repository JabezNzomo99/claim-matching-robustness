The tweet has been retweeted 138 times and liked 330 times.\n\nus to sort fact from fiction, so we looked at the data.\n\nThe source of the claim was\n\nfor January to March 2018, Robert Botha, the DA\u2019s senior issue driver for finance, told Africa Check.\n\nIn January to March 2017 \u2013 the first quarter of the year \u2013 there were an estimated 16,212,000 employed people in South Africa. In the first quarter of 2018 the number was 16,378,000 \u2013\n\nA manager with Stats SA\u2019s labour statistics division, Malerato Mosiane, told Africa Check that the claim was correct for net jobs.\n\nIn the Western Cape, there were\n\nin the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. If you work this out as a percentage of the 165,000 net jobs added for the whole country it does equal 74.5%.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that the rest of the country only produced 25% of jobs over the same period.\n\nSince the DA\u2019s calculation is based on net jobs, Limpopo can claim it created 50.3% of net jobs and KwaZulu-Natal can claim it created 37.6%\n\nStats SA\u2019s Mosiane told Africa Check that the Western Cape, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal accounted for 162% of net jobs. She said that claims like this \u201cmay be confusing\u201d.\n\nThis sentiment was also shared by Zaakhir Asmal, a researcher at the University of Cape Town\u2019s\n\n\u201cMathematically it makes sense,\u201d Asmal said, \u201cbut intuitively it is confusing to say that all of the provinces that experienced an increase in jobs over the period contributed to more than 100%of the total change in employment over the period.\u201d\n\nThis positive growth was offset by negative contributions made by Mpumalanga (-12.1%), the Eastern Cape (-27.3%) and Gauteng (-75.2%) over this period.\n\nWhen the positive and negative contributions of all nine provinces are totalled they equal 100%, as the table below shows.\n\nAsmal added that political parties in South Africa should take care when they boast of job creation in the areas they govern.\n\n\u201cWhile it may be true to say that a certain proportion of jobs created in the country was created in a particular province, it is not necessarily correct to say - or imply without evidence - that this is because a particular province is governed by a particular party,\u201d Asmal told Africa Check.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, claimed that the province they administer created 75% of the country\u2019s jobs in the past year.\n\nData from Statistics South Africa, the national statistics agency, shows that this is correct if the province\u2019s job gains are calculated as a share of net jobs created across the country.\n\nExperts warn that claims like this may be confusing because provincial job gains add up to more than 100%. This, however, is offset by negative contributions from the remaining provinces.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s official opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), took to Twitter recently to boast about a staggering figure.https://africacheck.org/reports/anc-job-creation-boast-ignores-sas-increased-unemployment-rate/", "lang": "en"}
