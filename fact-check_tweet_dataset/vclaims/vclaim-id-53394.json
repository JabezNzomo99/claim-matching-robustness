Grace Poe spuriously edited to make it look like she wants to block Facebook (FB) in the country, is circulating on social media.\n\nThe clip was uploaded by at least four YouTube channels from May 9 to 11 and all took out the preface of Poe\u2019s question during a four-hour January 2018 Senate hearing on disinformation. Cyberspace law expert Jose Jesus Disini had posed a question about what kind of leverage the country has on social media platforms.\n\nPoe\u2019s complete statement was: \u201cNot that we're going to do this - I'll be the first to disagree if they do - but, let's say, can you block a particular company like Facebook, for example, from being accessed in the Philippines? I know they do this in China.\u201d\n\nThe viral videos did not include the crucial clause (italicized part) of the senator's question.\n\nSurfacing after the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a cease and desist order on May 5 against ABS-CBN, YouTube channels Jeffrey&lovely Official, showbizz 1, and KaYoutubeTv published their false posts with headlines that essentially said: \u201cFacebook sa Pilipinas Pinapablock ni Senator Grace Poe NTC (Senator Grace Poe wants NTC to block Facebook in the Philippines).\u201d\n\nMy Anonymous Tv\u2019s version of the fallacious post was titled, \u201cSenator GRACE POE Can We Block FACEBOOK sa Buong PILIPINAS (in the whole country) Like China Did?\u201d\n\nThe senator has also debunked the viral video back in 2018 when it was first shared on social media, denying she wants to ban FB in the country.\n\nThe untrue posts were uploaded a few days after Poe released a statement supporting the renewal of ABS-CBN\u2019s legislative franchise, which expired May 4. Collectively, the four uploads have been viewed over 102,000 times.\n\nSocial media monitoring tool CrowdTangle shows there are 103 FB posts by pages and public groups carrying a link to Jeffrey&lovely Official\u2019s video -- which got the most views of the four -- with traffic coming largely from FB groups PROTECT THE PRESIDENT DUTERTE, RAFFY TULFO IN ACTION ADMINS GROUP S MEMBER, and SSS(E-1 & Statistic Report), PhilHealth(MDR), PagIbig(MID no.).\n\nJeffrey&lovely Official, showbizz 1, and KaYoutubeTv were created in April, September, and February 2019, while My Anonymous Tv was made just last month.", "lang": "en"}
