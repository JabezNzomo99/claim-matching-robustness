Things like income tax, for example, are collected at the UK level by HMRC. Some government spending benefits the UK as a whole, rather than specific regions.\n\nWales\u2019 fiscal deficit was about \u00a313 billion in 2014/15, according to the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University. This equalled about 24% of Welsh GDP, the value of goods and services produced in Wales.\n\nThe UK had a fiscal deficit worth about 5% of GDP in the same year (that\u2019s the whole of the UK, including Wales).\n\nWales\u2019s fiscal deficit has fallen in the past few years, as has the UK\u2019s as a whole. Its deficit will have been smaller last year if it continued to fall in line with the rest of the UK.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the report\u2019s authors when a comparison for 2015/16 and 2016/17 will be available.\n\nSince the quality of Scottish GDP estimates has been questioned recently we\u2019re also looking into whether similar criticisms would apply to this report, which takes a similar approach. For now these estimates seem to be the best available.", "lang": "en"}
