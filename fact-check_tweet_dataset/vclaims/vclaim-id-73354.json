The claim is false; the footage shows an anti-government protest in Belarus in August 2020.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on August 29, 2020. It has been shared more than 2,400 times.\n\nThe video's caption reads: \u201cAnti-Lockdown rally in London ?? today! Anyone else feel the shift? It\u2019s happening! #TheGreatAwakening\u201d.\n\nThe post circulated online after thousands gathered in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square on August 29 to protest against the country\u2019s coronavirus restrictions. Here is a report by UK newspaper The Guardian about the mass rally.\n\nThe video was also shared here, here, here, here, and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA Google reverse image search of keyframes extracted from the video in the misleading post found the same clip in this tweet published by Paul Ronzheimer, a reporter for German newspaper BILD, on August 23, 2020.\n\nThe tweet was part of a thread of videos from the Belarusian capital of Minsk.

Here is an AFP report on the ongoing unrest.\n\nThe location of the video in the misleading posts can be seen here on Google Street View. Exteriors of Minsk Central Post Office on Google match the building seen in the video.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and a Google Street View panorama view of the Minsk Central Post Office (R):\n\nCloser examination of the video also revealed that the people marching are holding white and red flags. Protesters opposed to Lukashenko have used a white and red flag in recent demonstrations -- the colours of the ex-Soviet country's emboldened opposition -- as a protest symbol against Lukashenko.", "lang": "en"}
