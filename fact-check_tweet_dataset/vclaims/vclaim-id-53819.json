Also, the caption in the post claims that the woman rejected the Khakhi Uniform and choose to wear traditional clothes with hijab.\n\nWe also found a similar post on Twitter as well.\n\nOther similar posts are found here, here, here, here, and here.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found the claims to be FALSE and MISLEADING.\n\nBy looking at the picture carefully, we got our first clue that the girl in the hijab looked too young to be an IPS officer.\n\nOn putting the picture through Google Reverse Image Search, we found this picture in a news article on Deshdoot.com dated March 4, 2020, claiming that on the occasion of International Women\u2019s Day, a 9th standard girl was given a chance to be Superintendent of Police.\n\nFurther, we also found another article on The Times of India dated March 5, 2020, claiming that a unique initiative has been taken on International Women\u2019s Day to boost the confidence of girls. The Buldana District of Nagur gave an opportunity to the bright student to act as a collector and a superintendent.\n\nWith the help of keyword search, we also found a picture of the same girl in another news article on Hauterfly dated March 6, 2020, claiming that this is the picture of International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nAlso, we found a video on YouTube, shared by The Times of India on March 5, 2020, showing visuals of the International Women\u2019s Day celebration.\n\nMoreover, we found a video of the student, Sahrish Kanwal, ZP Urdu High School, in which she herself says that on the occasion of International Women\u2019s Day she has been given the post of SP. We found this video on the YouTube channel of The Gulbarga Mirror uploaded on March 5, 2020.\n\nHence, don\u2019t fall for social media claims that the first Muslim woman IPS officer preferred wearing Burkha over a Khakhi uniform. Truth is that the picture is of a school student in hijab from ZP Urdu High School. The social media posts are fake with an intent to mislead.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
