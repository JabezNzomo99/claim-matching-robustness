One Facebook page shared a picture of the Sunday People\u2019s front page, which said:\n\nAnother post shared a screenshot of a tweet saying: \u201cThe Tory plot to raise the pension age to 75 means that a lot of people will never even see their pensions \u2013 which they will have paid for \u2013 because they will be dead.\u201d It has been shared over 200 times.\n\nIt\u2019s misleading to claim there is a Conservative plan to raise the pension age to 75, as we\u2019ve already explained.\n\nThe Centre for Social Justice, which first proposed Universal Credit and is chaired by former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, did recommend that the State Pension Age be increased to 75 by 2035 in a new report.\n\nBut the Department for Work and Pensions told us that it\u2019s not government policy to do this. It has since reiterated this publicly.\n\nState pension age in the UK is currently a little over 65 for both men and women. By October 2020 it will have risen to 66, from 66 to 67 between the years 2026 and 2028, and then from 67 to 68 between 2044 and 2046.", "lang": "en"}
