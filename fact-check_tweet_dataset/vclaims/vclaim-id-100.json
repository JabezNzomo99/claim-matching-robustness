(also known as Biggie Smalls) while quarantined in their homes during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe video was filmed in New York City, but not in Brooklyn. It was filmed in the Upper West Side in Manhattan. At the start of the video, the view from an apartment building reveals a view of Central Park, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side seen across the park.\n\nThe tall brown building shown in the initial frames of the video appears to be 350 Central Park West located between 94th and 95th Streets as seen from 95th Street. The building\u2019s exterior appears to match in both the video and Google street view in terms of color, windows and exterior markings ( bit.ly/39wLVSt ) on Google Earth, the views shown in the video are visible. Side-by-side comparisons of the Facebook video with screenshots from Google Earth matching the view from the area of 95th Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue can be seen ibb.co/K64L0Y7 .\n\nThe audio in this viral video was taken from a YouTube clip ( youtu.be/ga-YtKseifs?t=126 ) of Jay Z paying tribute to Biggie Smalls at Yankee Stadium during the Home and Home Tour in September 2010. The audio for the video in the claim matches the concert clip\u2019s audio on YouTube between 2:08 and 2:30.\n\nThe edit has provoked a mixed reaction on social media. \u201cThis is what music can mean to people. I love it,\u201d states one comment on the video in the link above. Another observes: \u201cI literally don\u2019t see 1 person or even 1 window open.\u201d Others note the deception, such as the comment: \u201cWhy do people think this is real\u2026 y\u2019all delusional from corona lockdown.\u201d\n\nFalse: this video does not show residents singing in Brooklyn, New York; it is a pan of Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side with overlaid audio from a 2010 YouTube clip of Jay Z performing a tribute to Biggie Smalls.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
