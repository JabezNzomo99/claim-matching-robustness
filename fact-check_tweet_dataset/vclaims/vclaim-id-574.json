The article has circulated widely, receiving more than 800,000 shares and began trending again on Facebook as of September 2019. It claims that \u201cthe act of fasting for as little as three days can regenerate the entire immune system\u201d based on the findings of a 2014 study[1]. Similar claims on the immune-boosting effects of fasting have also been made in outlets such as Medical News Today, The Source and Gaia.\n\nScientists who evaluated the claim for this review include the senior author of the 2014 study, Professor Valter Longo, who explained that the claim is misleading and unsupported. They highlighted that the study was performed in mice, not humans, and so the effects cannot be directly extrapolated to people.\n\nThe study was performed with the goal of determining whether fasting cycles could help protect chemotherapy-treated mice from immunosuppression. Immunosuppression is a problematic side effect of chemotherapy in cancer patients because it can increase the risk of microbial infections. The results of the study therefore hint at a mechanism that could potentially protect chemotherapy-treated patients from immunosuppression, but this remains to be explored in future studies. The effects of fasting on immunosuppression have also not been thoroughly studied in healthy people who are not undergoing chemotherapy treatment \u2013 it is therefore premature to claim that fasting would \u201cregenerate\u201d the immune system for everyone.\n\nSeveral other studies have demonstrated the profound effects of fasting on the immune system[2,3,4,5,6], however findings by some studies suggest that fasting could also have detrimental effects. For instance, one study found that fasting for 48 hours led to significantly slower wound healing in mice, as well as impaired immune response to infection[2]. The effects of fasting may also differ depending on a person\u2019s age and health status, making results hard to predict. As such, individuals are advised to consult their medical provider before beginning any fasting diet.\n\nA summary of research findings on the potential benefits and drawbacks of fasting and calorie restriction diets has been published by the National Institute on Aging, a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\n\n\n Valter Longo, Professor of Biological Sciences, Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California:\n\n The claim may be technically correct but misleading. Fasting increases the level and function of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT HSCs) in mice[1], which in fact can be responsible for the regeneration of the immune system and as far as I know the \u201centire immune system\u201d. However, this observation was made in mice, not in humans. In humans, we only know that fasting decreases the level of immune cells while re-feeding restores the level of immune cells. This suggests but does not prove that similar regenerative effects will take place in humans.\n\nStefan Jordan, Postdoctoral Fellow, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai:\n\n The claim that fasting regenerates the entire immune system is NOT justified.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors discovered that fasting has a pro-regenerative effect on stem cells after chemotherapy. The claim sounds as if one would get a brand new immune system through fasting. It is important to note that prolonged fasting in healthy adults can actually have negative effects on the immune response to infection and after tissue injury, as we reported in our recent study published in Cell[2].\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Cheng et al.
