But he did not exonerate Trump of all wrongdoing, as Trump inaccurately claimed.\n\nIn a joint interview published Dec. 2 by Time, France\u2019s Le Monde, Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel and Poland\u2019s Gazeta Wyborcza, Zelensky condemned the hold on U.S. aid while Ukraine was at war with Russia and said he didn\u2019t view his talks with Trump \"from the position of a quid pro quo.\"\n\nTrump hailed the interview on Twitter, writing that Zelensky \"has just again announced that President Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls.\"\n\nHe later repeated the claim while speaking to reporters at the White House.\n\n\"That should be case over,\" Trump said in reference to the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into whether Trump conditioned U.S. aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting on Zelensky\u2019s announcement of investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and the 2016 election.\n\nZelensky did not literally say that Trump did nothing wrong. Here are his translated remarks in context.\n\nThe joint interview with Zelensky was conducted in Russian, a Time spokesperson told us. Berlin-based Time reporter Simon Shuster, who was born in Russia, translated Zelensky\u2019s responses into English.\n\nBefore talking about U.S. politics, Zelensky answered questions on the conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine and his expectations for a Dec. 9 summit at which the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine are hoping to negotiate a peaceful resolution.\n\nAsked about the U.S. role in this peace process, Zelensky stressed the importance of U.S. support for Ukraine. He said he hoped the United States would use its power \"to influence Russia, to make everyone see that this (war) is a big tragedy, and that it must end.\"\n\n\"I would never want Ukraine to be a piece on the map, on the chess board of big global players, so that someone could toss us around, use us as cover, as part of some bargain,\" he said. \"As for the United States, I would really want \u2014 and we feel this, it\u2019s true \u2014 for them to help us, to understand us, to see that we are a player in our own right, that they cannot make deals about us with anyone behind our backs.\"\n\n\"The United States of America is a signal, for the world, for everyone,\" he continued. \"When America says, for instance, that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that is the hardest of signals.\"\n\nWhen asked at what point he sensed that there was a link between the freeze on U.S. aid for Ukraine and the investigations Trump and his allies wanted, Zelensky dismissed the idea that there was a clear trade-off at play.\n\n\"Look, I never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo. That\u2019s not my thing,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We\u2019re at war. If you\u2019re our strategic partner, then you can\u2019t go blocking anything for us. I think that\u2019s just about fairness. It\u2019s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\"\n\nThe interview shows Zelensky was critical of the Trump administration\u2019s block on military aid to Ukraine amid its war with Russia. At the same time, Zelensky said his conversations with Trump were not about a quid pro quo, which aligns with what the leader has said since the controversy started.\n\nOn Sept. 25, the day the White House released a readout of Zelensky\u2019s July 25 phone call with Trump, he appeared at a joint press conference with Trump and said the call was \"normal\" and that \"nobody pushed me.\"\n\nIn October, Zelensky said \"no blackmail\" occurred during the call.", "lang": "en"}
