Still, Russia\u2019s annexation, continued corruption, and the sanctions imposed on Moscow for its actions in Crimea have undercut foreign investment.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "November 20, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-10864", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/crimea-actually-had-foreign-investors-prior-to-annexation/28865195.html", "vclaim": "RIA Novosti quoted the head of the Crimean republic as saying the Black Sea peninsula had no foreign investors when it was under Ukraine\u2019s control, pointing to corruption as the reason and highlighting Russia\u2019s success in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) there despite Western sanctions.\n\nCrimea\u2019s top official, Sergei Aksyonov, told a group of foreign journalists: \u201cCrimea did not have any foreign investors when it was part of Ukraine, in connection with the exceptional corruption of the Ukrainian government; you could count them [foreign investors] on your fingers.\u201d\n\nCrimea, he added, did not suffer much as a result of the annexation, which cut the peninsula\u2019s economic ties to the rest of Ukraine and to foreign investors, because there was no significant investment. He said that a few Italian firms invested in Crimea after the annexation, admitting that Western companies have used loopholes to bypass the sanctions.\n\nAksyonov\u2019s comment came just after the republic held an international conference on November 6-7 titled \u201cRussia, Crimea, and Contemporary International Relations. Crimea\u2019s Friends Forum.\u201d The event drew former and current officials and political figures from more than 30 countries.\n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia in 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea -- an act the UN General Assembly denounced as illegal -- after popular protests in Kyiv led to the ouster of then President Victor Yanukovych. The sanctions, among other things, prohibit Western firms from investing Crimea.\n\nCrimea\u2019s annexation and subsequent sanctions have undermined its trade ties with the rest of Ukraine and forced some investors to leave while driving away potential ones, according to media reports from the region and the West.\n\nMultinational corporations and retail brands, such as McDonald\u2019s Corp, Radisson Hotel, and Mobile Telesystems PJSC, among others, ceased operations in Crimea. Foreign banks stopped lending.\n\nIn 2015, Crimean real estate prices dropped by 60-70 percent compared to 2013. \u201cNo foreign investor will be interested in buying property in the region until it is recognized by the rest of the world,\u201d said Ilya Volodko, head of the Macon Realty Group real estate consultancy.\n\nCrimea\u2019s tourist industry, traditionally a big earner for the peninsula, also suffered. The number of visitors in 2015 dropped by almost half, from an estimated six million in 2013.\n\nForeign trade turnover has shrunk more than tenfold since 2014, although media reports indicate Crimean traders are \u201cperforming some logistical gymnastics to skirt sanctions.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, imports stood at $1 billion and exports at $0.9 billion. By mid-2017, imports and exports combined amounted to only $153.5 million.\n\nIlan Berman, vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council, described the post-annexation situation this way: \u201cCrimea, which experienced comparative prosperity as one of Ukraine\u2019s regions, has seen a near-total reversal of fortune under Russian rule.\u201d\n\nContrary to Aksyonov\u2019s claim, FDI did flow into Crimea before Russia annexed it \u2013 mostly from Cyprus and Russia, but also from Britain, Germany, France, and the United States, among other countries. At the start of 2012, foreign direct investment in the peninsula stood at approximately $1.17 billion.\n\nIn 2013, investment from Cyprus amounted to $426 million, or 29% of total FDI, followed by Russia at $369 million, or 25% of total FDI. Investment from Germany and the Netherlands that year amounted to 9.3% and 8.1% of total FDI, respectively.\n\nSome of the investment from Cyprus originated in Russia or Ukraine. How significant that investment was is unclear, but some analysts estimated that up to 60 percent of the investments from Cyprus may have been Russian.\n\nAksyonov\u2019s claim that extensive corruption in Ukraine impeded foreign direct investment in Crimea appears valid, but overlooks that Crimea faces the same problem under Russian rule.\n\nThe 2016 OECD report on Ukraine\u2019s investment climate highlighted the long-standing nature of the challenges facing Ukraine\u2019s economy following Crimea\u2019s annexation: \u201cWhile the political and security situation has deteriorated in recent years, the problems are long-term and have to do with poor business environment, weak institutions, and widespread corruption.\u201d\n\nThe report underlined that while expropriations are rare in most parts of Ukraine, they occurred primarily in Crimea after it was annexed by Russia. According to Ukrainian justice ministry figures cited in the report, 4,000 enterprises faced asset expropriations worth $2.3 billion from March-December 2014, prompting legal action by Ukraine against Russia.\n\nAfter annexation, FDI in mainland Ukraine and Crimea plummeted. Investment in mainland Ukraine dropped by 45% in 2013 and 81% in 2014 before starting to recover in 2015.\n\nRussia has sought to improve the investment climate in Crimea, but continued corruption, red tape, and sanctions have dampened FDI prospects for the peninsula.\n\nAccording to Crimean authorities, the value of current investment projects is $2.27 billion.\n\nHowever, it is unclear what portion of that investment comes from Russia, compared to other countries, and how the Russian investment breaks down between state and private companies.\n\nRussia\u2019s own poor economic conditions following the collapse in oil prices and imposition of sanctions have also undercut Russia\u2019s investment efforts.\n\nAlexander Alikin, a Eurasianet contributor, reported that there is a lack of private investment in Crimea, noting that investors made good on only 123 out 441 proposed investment projects.\n\nAccording to some sources, Western firms do business and invest in Crimea despite the sanctions, corruption, and red tape. These include the French retail group Auchan.\n\nIn 2016, Andrei Melnikov, Crimea\u2019s minister of economic development, claimed that 250 firms operated in Crimea using the capital of investors from Turkey, Ukraine, Germany, Britain and the Virgin Islands, while companies from Saudi Arabia, China, and Germany expressed interest in investing in Crimea.\n\nYury Rovinsky, a St. Petersburg businessman, said in March that he had passed up an opportunity to invest in Crimea because of \u201ca complete lack of understanding\u201d by Crimean authorities.\n\n\u201cVerbally, they welcome investors, but in fact they serve as a complete stopper,\u201d he said. \u201cI constantly faced hints and suggestions to organize various kinds of corruption schemes. In general, one should wait until everything settles down with the government.\u201d\n\nUkraine and Russia both ranked 131 out of 176 on the 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index compiled by Transparency International, the Berlin-based international corruption watchdog. Out of 190 countries, the World Bank ranks Russia 35th and Ukraine 76th in terms of \u201cEase of Doing Business.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
