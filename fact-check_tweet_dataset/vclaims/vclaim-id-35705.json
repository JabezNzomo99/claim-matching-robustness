This isn\u2019t strictly true.\n\nThe report was based off findings published by the reading charity BookTrust who commissioned Opinium Research to survey parents in January 2020.\n\nOne of the questions asked to parents of children aged seven to nine was:\n\n'How much time do you spend reading to or with your child in an average week for fun? Please do not include any reading that is set by school'.\n\nThey found that 14% read with their child for less than 15 minutes a week.\n\nThe problem with the press release from the BookTrust and subsequent reporting is that finding that one in seven parents doesn\u2019t read to their child for more than 15 minutes per week doesn\u2019t mean that one in seven children aren\u2019t being read to for 15 minutes a week.\n\nMost children have two parents or carers in the home. We don\u2019t know the numbers specifically for children aged seven to nine but we know that of the eight million families with dependent children, around 1.8 million are single-parent families.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s likely that parents who read to their child for less than 15 minutes per week are living in a household where there is another parent. And, as we don\u2019t know how much that parent is reading to their child, we can\u2019t say from this research how many children are being read to for less than 15 minutes a week, by either parent.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to BookTrust and will update this if they get back to us.", "lang": "en"}
