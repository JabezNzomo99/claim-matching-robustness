The segment can be viewed in full below. The following is an excerpted transcript of Posobiec\u2019s report, which carried the headline \u201cObama Officials Caught Advising Iran How to Defeat U.S. Foreign Policy\u201d:\n\nIn a shocking new report today, we are now learning that former members of the Obama administration have been caught holding backchannel communications with Iranian officials on how to defeat U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration. Specifically, they have been contacting Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2026 In some cases, Obama officials reportedly attended Capitol Hill meetings to learn information about new U.S. policies, from Congressional Democrats, and then relayed that information to the Iranian government. This, of course, is in violation of the Logan Act, the same act that General [Mike] Flynn was spied upon [sic] after Trump had been elected. Obama officials are desperate to rebuild the Iran nuclear deal that Trump dropped, and they are working with their allies in Congress to complete it. All of this comes at a time when the Trump administration has been successful in isolating Iran from many of its European allies and trading partners, and now in some cases is even seeming to isolate Iran from Syria and Russia by pulling Hezbollah fighters out of Syria, and Russia rejecting Iran\u2019s offer to purchase a major air defense system from Moscow. The U.S. has also labeled the Iranian Revolutionary National Guard a terrorist force, and sent military equipment to the Middle East, with escalating tensions against the Islamic republic. To be clear, the fact that former Obama officials are holding shadow diplomacy with Iran and possibly passing them information from allies in Congress, to undermine U.S. foreign policy, is shocking, and must be investigated by [Attorney General William] Barr, immediately. Let that sink in.\n\nThe video was shared widely in the early days of January 2020 and re-promoted on Twitter by Posobiec himself, amid the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran at that time, especially after the Jan. 2 assassination by the U.S. of Qassem Soleimani, major general of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.\n\nWe asked Posobiec to cite or provide sources and evidence in support of the claims in his report. In response, he sent us a link to a May 31, 2019, article published by the right-leaning website Breitbart, which bore the headline \u201cReport: Obama Administration Alumni Advising Iranian Regime on Dealing With Trump.\u201d That article was in turn based on an earlier report by The Daily Beast, with the headline \u201cTeam Obama Tells Iran: Don\u2019t Escalate, Don\u2019t Take Trump\u2019s Bait.\u201d That article reported that:\n\nAs the Trump administration sent warplanes and an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, a small group of former Obama administration officials reached out to their contacts in the Iranian government, including Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Their message to Iran: Don\u2019t take Trump\u2019s bait. Stay calm. Conversations between former Obama officials and Iranian government officials have been ongoing since November 2016. Zarif, who visits the U.S. every year for the U.N. General Assembly in New York, usually meets with lawmakers, think tanks, journalists, and former officials when he is in town. But the recent round of conversations, which took place over the phone and in person over the last two months, came as lines of communication between the U.S. and Iran, through intermediaries in Europe and elsewhere, deteriorated.\n\nThe Daily Beast\u2019s article cited unnamed purported former Obama administration officials as saying they had held informal discussions with current Iranian government officials, encouraging them not to respond in kind to the Trump administration\u2019s escalation of tensions between the two countries, as follows:\n\n\u201cOne former official who worked on the Obama administration\u2019s Iran policy told The Daily Beast he spoke with Iranian government officials as recently as a few weeks ago, as tensions were cresting. His message, he said, was simple: The Trump administration can escalate things plenty all by itself; the Iranians shouldn\u2019t take the bait, fuel the fire, and move things from bad to worse by, for example, pulling completely out of the nuclear deal.\u201d\n\nNeither The Daily Beast\u2019s nor Breitbart\u2019s articles contained the allegation (made by Posobiec) that those former Obama officials funneled to the Iranian government information they had acquired in congressional meetings. Furthermore, Posobiec\u2019s claim that the officials had been \u201ccaught\u201d engaging in discussions appears misleading, because The Daily Beast reported that some of those officials themselves told the website about the talks, which they purportedly viewed as \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nSince the version of events presented by The Daily Beast was purportedly based on briefings given by unnamed individuals, we cannot verify its key claims by contacting those individuals directly. As such, its claims, and the claims contained in Breitbart\u2019s subsequent article and Posobiec\u2019s later OANN report, remain unproven. If we obtain on-the-record evidence that definitively corroborates or disproves those claims, we will update this fact check accordingly.", "lang": "en"}
