Earlier, the mine owners used to pay money to dispose the dust. Today, they sell to Haldiram @ approx Rs 19 per kg. This is used primarily in bhujia to make it crispy.'\n\nNewsMeter also received the viral message on WhatsApp asking for a fact check.\n\nArchived claims can be found here and here.\n\nThe claim that all Haldiram snacks were banned by USFDA and Haldiram's uses marble dust from Makrana to make their bhujia crispy is FALSE.\n\nIt is true that USFDA had seized a consignment and issued a warning letter in 2017, which was updated in 2018. However, we can see no latest updates about the brand on its website.\n\nFirstpost and Wall Street journal articles quoted in the viral message are from the year 2015.\n\nAccording to a report in NDTV food, published in 2017, USFDA has rejected several batches of Haldiram snacks over the years. But, this is the news from the year 2017.\n\nRecently, Amazon, USA has started selling Haldiram's products on its online portal. According to a report by the Economic Times, published in November 2019, Haldiram's has USFDA approved selection with customized packaging for the market which has been made live and fulfilled by Amazon in the USA.\n\nIn another report published by The Hindu Business line, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India CEO Pawan Agarwal has been pushing the packaged food industry to voluntarily cut down on salt, sugar and saturated fat-levels, and several companies have already made commitments under its flagship programme \"The Eat Right India Movement\". This also comes at a time when FSSAI is in the process of overhauling the labeling regulations.\n\nAccording to a report published in The Tribune, in May 2020, Pawan Agarwal rubbished the viral internet forwards saying the USFDA had banned Haldiram's products from sales on grounds of harmful ingredients, including marble dust, being found in them.\n\nHe said that these forwards were three years old when the USFDA had seized certain consignments of the food brand in question. He said, even so, the part that marble dust was found in these products was bogus.\n\nAgarwal denied that the USFDA this week had issued bans on some Indian food majors. On concerns around the marble dust in Haldiram's Bhujia, Agarwal said, \"This is a bogus claim. Haldiram and other Bhujia brands use a certain form of pulse locally available in Rajasthan to make their products crisp. There's no marble dust.\"\n\nTherefore, more than 3-year-old messages are going viral again claiming that Haldiram's has been rejected by the USFDA. These claims are FALSE and selected Haldiram products are now being sold on Amazon in the USA.", "lang": "en"}
