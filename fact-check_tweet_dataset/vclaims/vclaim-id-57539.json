Let\u2019s analyze the claim about the video.\n\n\n\nClaim: : Video of Muslims gathered on roads despite the curfew to curb the spread of Coronavirus. Fact: The video is from Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and was taken in December 2019. So, the video is of an incident that took place prior to the announcement of lockdown in Gujarat. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, it was found that the video is from Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and was taken in December 2019. It shows the violence that erupted during the anti-CAA protests in Shah-e-Alam area wherein the protestors pelted stones on several Police vans. So, the video is of an incident that took place prior to the introduction of lockdown in Gujarat to curb the spread of Coronavirus. When the video has earlier gone viral with another claim, FACTLY has debunked it and has written a fact-check article on it.\n\nTo conclude, an old video is being shared as \u2018Muslims gathered on roads despite the existing curfew\u2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
