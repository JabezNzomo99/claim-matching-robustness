Trump said they did at a rally in Lebanon, Ohio, on Oct. 12.\n\nHe said, \"I'll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress \u2014 thanks to (Ohio Republican Sen.) Rob Portman and a lot of others \u2014 thank you, Rob \u2014 but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support.\"\n\nWas this a mostly Republican-backed bill?\n\nNot at all. In fact, it garnered as close as you can come to universal support in this politically polarized era.\n\nThe bill offered such provisions as barring fentanyl from being imported by mail, expanding the ability of nurses to prescribe medication to counter opioid addiction, and enhanced access to treatment for Medicaid recipients.\n\nIt was originally introduced in June by several House Republicans and Democrats. The Democrats included Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Frank Pallone of New Jersey, and Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\nThe initial version passed the House by a 396-14 margin and the equivalent version passed the Senate by a 99-1 margin. After the chambers ironed out their differences, the final version passed the House 393-8 on Sept. 28 and the Senate 98-1 on Oct. 3. (The only vote against the bill in the Senate \u2014 on both versions \u2014 was by a Republican, Mike Lee of Utah.)\n\nThe bill then went to the president, but he hasn\u2019t officially signed it yet. The New York Times called it \"rare bipartisan accord.\"\n\nThe bill\u2019s bipartisan nature was among the top themes in news coverage.\n\nWe reached out to the White House but did not hear back.\n\nTrump said the recent opioid bill had \"very little Democrat support.\"\n\nThat couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Virtually every Democrat (and virtually every Republican) voted for the bill on the floor. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
