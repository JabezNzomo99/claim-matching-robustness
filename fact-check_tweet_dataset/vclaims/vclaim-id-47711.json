Viewer descretion is advised.]\n\nKashish News reporter Sohan Singh also shared the video with the claim that it shows the incident from Ekauni village. He later took down the tweet. The video has also been deleted from the Twitter handle of The News Khazana.\n\nUpon reverse-searching a keyframe of the video, we found that it pertains to an incident from September 2019. A local channel from Bihar Prabhat Varta had carried a video report on the incident. As per the channel, \u201cThe dead bodies of two youths was recovered from Aurai, Muzaffarpur which enraged locals who began protesting by blocking roads. Policemen reached the spot to calm the crowd but were attacked by a mob that chased and thrashed them. The police also had to fire multiple rounds to control the situation.\u201d\n\nBihar News had also shared this video on September 7, 2019. According to the channel, the incident is from Aurai district\u2019s Beshi village in Madhuban.\n\nTherefore, a video of locals attacking police in an unrelated incident in Bihar last year has been shared as the incident where cops were thrashed during coronavirus screening in the state\u2019s Aurangabad.", "lang": "en"}
