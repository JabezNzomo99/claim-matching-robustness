The claim is false; the video has been taken from a 2010 episode of the BBC\u2019s Top Gear program; NASA said the footage actually showed tests of rocket engines.\n\nThe footage was shared in this September 29, 2018 Facebook post, where it has been viewed more than 3,500 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s caption says: \u201cRain clouds generator engine developed by Nasa. See where the world is moving...Amazing...!\u201d\n\nNASA refers to The National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nThe same video was shared with a similar claim on Facebook here and here. The same video was shared on Twitter here and on YouTube here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; most of the video has been captured from a 2001 episode of \"Speed\", part of the BBC\u2019s Top Gear program. The footage in the misleading post contains a BBC watermark on top-left corner. Former BBC presenter Jeremy Clarkson can be seen in the clip.\n\nIn the video, Clarkson says to the camera: \u201cDon\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t hear what I\u2019m saying, I couldn\u2019t even hear myself. This is the loudest sound you could possibly conceive. And, as it turns out, the cleanest. Now, the most amazing thing is that that cloud up there, which was generated by the engine, is just a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen -- it\u2019s water vapour! And in about an hours time, someone in Mississippi is going to get wet washing, it will actually rain! [sound of rain] I told you! It\u2019s raining! That\u2019s unbelievable! NASA\u2019s playing god, it\u2019s making its own weather.\u201d\n\nA reverse image search on Google found this corresponding video published on the verified YouTube channel of the BBC\u2019s Top Gear program on October 29, 2010.\n\nThe title of the video says: \u2018Space Shuttle Rocket Booster Test | Speed | Top Gear\u2019.\n\nThe caption of the 2-minutes 52-seconds video states: \"Jeremy Clarkson heads to Mississippi where NASA test their Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters. Consuming half a million gallons of fuel, they generate the thrust needed to propel astronauts into space.\"\n\nThe Top Gear video corresponds with the video in the misleading posts from the 1-minute 54-seconds mark until the 2-minutes-47 seconds mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook post (L) and YouTube video of the \u2018Space Shuttle Rocket Booster Test\u2019 (R):\n\nNASA\u2019s news chief Valerie Buckingham told AFP that the misleading footage did not show a rain cloud machine.\n\n\u201cNo, we have not created an engine for the specific purpose of generating clouds. Let me provide some clarification,\u201d Buckingham told AFP by email on July 10.\n\nThe first five seconds of the misleading Facebook video -- which do not appear in the Top Gear program -- show an RS-25 engine test, Buckingham said.\n\n\u201cThe Facebook video is a combined video of the RS-25 engine on the A-1 stand and the RS-68 commercial engine on the B-1 stand at NASA\u2019s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Top Gear YouTube clip shows \u201cthe RS-68 commercial test at Stennis,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Buckingham: \u201cThe engines in the video run on liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants. The chemical composition of water is H2O (hydrogen and oxygen). These are mixed in the combustion chamber and ignited, which results in extremely high-temperature steam (6000 degree F) coming out of the nozzle at a very high rate and pressure. That steam rises in the atmosphere, creating a steam cloud that cools off and turns back into water and rains depending on the temperature and humidity at the time of the test. There is also water flowing in the flame deflector which also mixes in the cloud. The steam released during a test is water and does not pollute the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe first five seconds of footage in the misleading posts has been captured from this video published on NASA's official YouTube channel on October 19, 2017. The video's title states: \"NASA Tests RS-25 Flight Engine for Space Launch System\".\n\nThe video is embedded below:\n\nUPDATED: this story was updated 22/07/2019 to change the date of the footage mentioned paragraph eight.", "lang": "en"}
