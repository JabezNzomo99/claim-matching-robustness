So there's a bit of uncertainty about that part of the figure.\n\nThe charity's analysts arrived at the four million figure by combining five different sets of numbers.\n\nEach of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland give separate figures for people aged 17 and over recorded by their GP as having diabetes. Those added up to almost three and a half million patients last year.\n\nBut Diabetes UK reckons there are plenty more undiagnosed cases of Type 2 diabetes\u2014some 549,000.\n\nThis estimate is one the charity has produced itself. Data from government body Public Health England seems to support the idea that there are around this number of undiagnosed cases, though we weren't able to fully verify this when we last wrote about this subject.\n\nThat's not to say that 549,000 isn't a legitimate estimate. It's just less concrete than the GP registers of diagnosed patients. By definition, it's probably impossible to be certain of how many unknown cases exist.\n\nWhen Diabetes UK last produced these figures in August 2015, its estimate of undiagnosed cases was higher, at 590,000.\n\nWe can confidently say that at least three and a half million people had diabetes last year, and that this number is rising.", "lang": "en"}
