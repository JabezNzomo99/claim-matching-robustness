It\u2019s called opposition research,\" Trump said July 13, 2017, in Paris, during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nOver his brief political tenure, Trump said he\u2019s received numerous offers of damaging information on his rivals, known as opposition research, or \"oppo,\" a tradecraft Trump said he views as standard practice in the rough-and-tumble world of politics.\n\nWe decided to look closer at some of the claims Trump made during his remarks.\n\n\"It's very standard where they have information and you take the information.\"\n\nSeeking opposition research is normal practice. But consultants told us it's fairly unusual for a campaign to meet with a purported foreign government agent in their quest to dig up dirt.\n\nMike Mikus, a Democratic campaign consultant, called it \"purposeful misdirection\" to argue that Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting was an ordinary occurrence.\n\n\"I have been working on campaigns since 1994 and have managed races since 1998,\" Mikus said. \"I have never heard of any operative meeting with a representative of a foreign government \u2013 friend or foe \u2013 to discuss opposition research.\"\n\nOn the other hand, just because something is unusual doesn\u2019t mean it's unprecedented.\n\nFor example, the White House has recently pointed to Hillary Clinton campaign\u2019s involvement with information originating from Ukraine (which we looked into here).\n\n\"The press made a very big deal over something that really a lot of people would do.\"\n\nTrump blamed the media for being alarmist in its recent coverage.\n\nYet most legal experts we spoke to said the meeting raised concerns about whether U.S. federal election law was followed.\n\nFederal law prohibits a foreign national from giving anything of value to a campaign engaged in a U.S. election. It\u2019s also a crime to solicit a foreign national to do so, or even to \"knowingly provide substantial assistance\" in receiving something of value, which could include information.\n\nAccording to an email chain Trump Jr. published July 11 on Twitter, the meeting was predicated on the promise that a \"Russian government attorney\" would deliver damaging information to Trump Jr. about his father\u2019s Democratic opponent as part of the Kremlin\u2019s effort to tip the scales in Trump\u2019s favor.\n\n\"The tweeted emails make things worse for Trump Jr.,\" said Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law in Chapel Hill. \"He looks now as if he attended the meeting with not only his eyes open but also to acquire information -- something of value -- in violation of federal law.\"\n\n\"Nothing came of the meeting.\"\n\nTrump said in his remarks that \"nothing came of the meeting.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t know, beyond the statements of Trump Jr. and others, what happened in the meeting or what information was shared.\n\nBut it certainly will be probed by lawmakers and law enforcement officials investigating possible connections between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told reporters he intends to invite Trump Jr. to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nAnd according to CNN, the meeting with the Russian lawyer and the related email chain will figure into the Russian-meddling investigation headed by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nMore from PolitiFact on the Trump-Russia story\n\nLewandowski wrongly says Trump in Florida day of Trump Tower meeting with Russian lawyer\n\nFact-checking Donald Trump\u2019s comments about campaign meeting with Russian lawyer\n\nTrump and Russia, Clinton and Ukraine: How do they compare?\n\nThe possible ties between Trump and Russia, explained\n\nIs 'collusion' illegal?
