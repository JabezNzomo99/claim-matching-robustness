No, that's not true: A draft of a short research paper that has not been reviewed by scientific peers or published in an accredited scientific journal did make the claim, however, it has been called \"deeply flawed\" and discredited by other climate change scientists.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by ZeroHedge.com on July 11, 2019 titled \"Bombshell Claim: Scientists Find \"Man-made Climate Change Doesn't Exist In Practice\"\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe ZeroHedge's second paragraph said:\n\nBefore we look at the science involved, let's check the process through which this research has recently become public. Scientific studies are usually published in peer-reviewed journals relevant to the topic before journalists write about their conclusions. This is basic and important so that the reader has more confidence a research paper is valid.\n\nThe proliferation of questionable \"academic journals\" that publish papers for a fee is a concern if they do not include a legitimate peer review process. A journalist did a \"sting\" operation in 2013 that uncovered dozens of such fake journals. Read his story Who's Afraid of Peer Review? We are not suggesting this paper was published by such a journal. We are only noting that peer review is important and it was not published by any journal that required peer review. In fact, it was only posted by a \"preprint\" website. This is an avenue for a researcher to share their work with other scientists BEFORE peer review. It is not intended to be presented to the public as final.\n\nThe operations manager for the website that hosted the paper -- arXiv.org -- confirmed to Lead Stories in an email that there was no peer review and the simple posting of the short paper (11 pages) is not the same as being \"pubished.\" Jim Entwood said:\n\nYou can read this \"prepint\" paper titled \"NO EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR THE SIGNIFICANT ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE.\" Now, let's look at the initial reaction from climate experts who have seen it. Seven researchers have posted their review on ClimateFeedback.org, which describes itself as \"a not-for-profit organization verifying the credibility of influential claims and media coverage that claims to be scientific, starting with the topics of climate and health.\" The resulting analysis is titled \"Non-peer-reviewed manuscript falsely claims natural cloud changes can explain global warming.\" The scientific reviewers rate the finding that natural cloud changes -- and not human activity -- is the major factor in rising climate temperatures as \"incorrect.\" They offer three main objections:\n\nThe \"Key Take Away\" of this review:\n\nAs for the several \"news\" reports citing the questionable findings, the scientists said this:\n\nSome news outlets are publishing articles stating that this claim is based on a new study. In reality, there is no new published study. The claim comes from a six-page document uploaded to arXiv, a website traditionally used by scientists to make manuscripts available before publication. This means that this article has not been peer-reviewed, so there is no guarantee to its credibility.\n\n\n\nIf the blogs that covered this as a new study had contacted independent scientists for insight, instead of accepting this short document as revolutionary science, they would have found that it does not have any scientific credibility.\n\nIf you wish to see the full review, just click here.\n\nZeroHedge.com did not include any acknowledgement that this paper was not peer reviewed and it did not appear to have reached out to other climate change experts for comment.\n\nLead Stories has called and emailed the primary author of the study in Finland. We will add his response when we recieve it.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes zerohedge.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
