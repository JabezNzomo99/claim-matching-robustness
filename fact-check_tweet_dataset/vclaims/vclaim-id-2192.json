The picture isn\u2019t from Houston nor from this year. It\u2019s from a homeless shelter in Washington, D.C., where Obama and his family served Thanksgiving dinner to homeless veterans on Nov. 25, 2015. Both tweets have since been deleted.\n\nAs the following AP video shows, the president served turkey while his wife and daughters served stuffing, vegetables and cranberry sauce.\n\n\"I took down the tweet of obama, I apologize to people who thought it was real. also to @callrail I apologize!\"\n\n\"I took the tweet down it was wrong information sorry if you thought it was real,\" Benjamin wrote to PolitiFact.\n\nHe had originally issued a correction that said, \"Sorry for people thinking this was in texas (he was there) but this is from 2015.\"\n\nA representative for Obama told CNN the former president was not in Texas.\n\nObama wrote a tweet on Aug. 27 thanking first responders and sharing a link to make donations to the Red Cross.\n\nA popular tweet said President Barack Obama was serving meals in Texas as part of his response to Hurricane Harvey.\n\nBut the photo accompanying the tweet was from 2015. Obama is not in Texas, a spokesman for the former president confirmed.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
