Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.\n\nClaim: Priyanka poses with the victory symbol in front of the Modi\u2019s poster. Fact: The image has been photoshopped. Priyanka\u2019s head has been placed over some other woman\u2019s head. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen Priyanka\u2019s face in the image is cropped and ran through Google Reverse Image Search, a Huffing Post article with the same image is found in the search results. The face of Priyanka has been taken from the image in the article and was placed on someone else in the posted photo. The identity of the person and the source of the original photo was not found on the internet. So, the photo posted on Facebook is photoshopped.\n\nTo sum it up, Priyanka Gandhi was not posing in front of Modi\u2019s poster. It\u2019s a photoshopped image.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
