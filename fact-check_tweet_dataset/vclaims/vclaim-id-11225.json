And I saw the greatest people I\u2019ve ever seen in action.\u201d The businessman did not correct himself.\n\nWhile video of the event was widely circulated via social media and was published by several major media outlets such as CNN, some viewers were still skeptical about the footage, perplexed that someone who frequently invoked the 9/11 terrorist attacks during his campaign speeches could apparently mix up the date.\n\n\n\n While Twitter users, comedians, and political foes poked fun of Trump, some partisans maintained that the candidate didn\u2019t misspeak; he was referring to the Greenville Fire District station located at 711 Central Park in Scarsdale, New York. However, that station has never been referred to as \u201c7/11,\u201d as the Greenville Fire District indicated in a message posted on the station\u2019s web site:\n\nOthers maintained that Trump was referring to Firestation #711 or Firemen\u2019s Legion #711 (Engine 7, Ladder 1, Battalion 1), some of the first responders to the 9/11 attacks. However, a spokesman for the FDNY said that this station would never be referred to as \u201c711,\u201d noting that fire stations are occasionally referred to by their engine and ladder, but never by their battalion:\n\nIt\u2019s always referred to as Engine then Ladder so it\u2019s Engine 7 Ladder 1. Battalion wouldn\u2019t come into play. All of those options you listed are NOT used. And they are never referred to as 711.\n\nAlso, as far as we know neither Trump nor his campaign has offered this alternative as an explanation, with Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson saying the candidate\u2019s remark was a \u201cslip of the tongue\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
