In 2015, total US exports of goods to Japan was $62,387.8 million, while in 2014, while in 2014, it was $66,891.8 million.\n\nWe also checked the data from 1985, when the value of US export of goods to Japan could be seen to be $22,630.9 million.\n\nHowever, it may be noted that the US imports of goods from Japan have remained consistently higher than its exports.\n\nFurther, according to data from the website of the United States Trade Representative, as of 2019, Japan is USA\u2019s fourth largest goods trading partner. The data also showed that US goods exports to Japan in 2019 accounted for 4.5 percent of overall US exports in that year and that while it was down 0.8 percent from 2018, it was up 46 percent from 2009.\n\nThe same website also provides details of the exports and the categories in which most exports took place.\n\nAccording to an article by BloombergQuint, Japan was a protectionist country in the past and would be hesitant to allow foreign goods to enter the nation. But the article says that this has changed and that Japan is now very open to products from countries including the US, especially after some talks between the two in the 1990s. According to a report on US-Japan trade agreement negotiations, various non-tariff barriers in the Japanese market were a concern for the US in the 1980s and 1990s, but these concerns have waned since.", "lang": "en"}
