It has been in circulation since at least 1909.\n\nWhile he authored many witty sayings, this oft-shared quote did not originate with Twain, author of classics like \u201cThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\u201d and \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller searched for the expression in Twain\u2019s entire body of work but found no matches. There is no record of the saying or anything similar in his correspondence either.\n\n\u201cI can find no record of Twain having ever said that,\u201d confirmed Twain scholar Cindy Lovell in an email to the Daily Caller.

Since then, versions of the expression have also been attributed to Ernest Hemingway and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.", "lang": "en"}
