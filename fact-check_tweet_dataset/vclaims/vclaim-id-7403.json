It's the WRONG face of a hero!\u201d\n\nIn an article by the Philippine Daily Inquirer in August 2014, Jose Ampeso detailed how Aquino asked for his help to obtain two passports \u2013 with one bearing the name \"Marcial Bonifacio\u201d \u2013 in 1983 while they were both in the United States. Ampeso was the Vice Consul at the Philippine Consulate in New Orleans, while Aquino was in exile.\n\nAmpeso also said in another interview with GMA News in August 2014 that the procurement of the passports were \u201ccleared\u201d by the administration of then-President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nMeanwhile, journalist Ken Kashiwahara who was with Aquino in his last flight to the Philippines, wrote in the New York Times that Aquino traveled with his \"Marcial Bonifacio\" passport, reportedly bought in the Middle East, and a blank passport provided by an old government acquaintance.\n\nIn former president Corazon \u201cCory\u201d Aquino\u2019s memoir of her late husband published by the Inquirer in 2003, she said that the \"Marcial Bonifacio\" passport was provided by Lucman, and the second passport which carried Ninoy's real name was supplied by one of his friends in the United States.\n\nIn fact, in a 2010 History Channel documentary on Aquino, it can be seen he was holding a Philippine passport under his alias during his last flight home. The voice-over described it as a fake passport.\n\nIn an ambush interview on August 21, former president Benigno \"Noynoy\" Aquino III said the claim is \u201cfake news\u201d after reading about it in a newspaper. He also emphasized that his father was born in 1932. Malaysia was officially recognized as a sovereign country only in 1957.\n\nThe claim of Aquino having a Malaysian passport and being a Malaysian citizen surfaced as early as 2016 in a blog with the domain falconbase2008.wordpress.com. The post said that Aquino entered the Philippines on August 21, 1983 with a genuine Malaysian passport, and not a counterfeit Philippine passport.", "lang": "en"}
