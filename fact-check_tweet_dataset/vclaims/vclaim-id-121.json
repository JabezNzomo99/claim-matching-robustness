The image shows shipping containers in a warehouse ( here , here , here ).\n\nThe text accompanying the image, shared at least 9,700 times according to CrowdTangle, reads, \u201cHere\u2019s the ventilators that was (sic) sent to New York. Stuck in a warehouse. Democrat Governor Cuomo? Why?\u201d Another reads, \u201cStockpile of 2000 ventilators found in NYC warehouse. Time to find a new governor New York.\u201d\n\nSome of the claims include a photograph by photographer Scott Lynch that appeared in the Gothamist, a local outlet ( here ). It shows ventilators in the New York City\u2019s Emergency Management Warehouse in Brooklyn on March 24.\n\nThe medical machines visible in Lynch\u2019s photographs were part of an initial shipment of 400 ventilators (of a total of 2,500) that was sent by the federal government ( here ).\n\nFootage of the press conference held by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on March 24 ( bit.ly/3aIIFEO ) shows these ventilators being moved to Emergency Management trucks. The Emergency Management warehouse confirmed to Reuters via email that this shipment was distributed to hospitals in New York City that same day.\n\nThe New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene told Reuters on March 31 that \u201cnearly all\u201d of the 2,500 total ventilators received from the federal government had been distributed to hospitals.\n\n\u201cVirtually all the vents that shipped went out within a day or so of receipt,\u201d a department spokesperson said. \u201cVentilators are received on large military-grade containers and need to be unpacked and repacked, in the necessary quantities, with component parts in order to be ready to go, which is what accounts for any turnaround time. That turnaround time is minimal because the staff are literally working around the clock.\u201d\n\nAnother iteration of the claim includes a screengrab of a tweet by Donald Trump modified to include similar photographs of containers of ventilators the President did not actually tweet ( here ).\n\nTrump did tweet, \u201cThousands of Federal Government (delivered) Ventilators found in New York storage. N.Y. must distribute NOW\u201d here .\n\nThe Health Department told Reuters, \u201cStaff are working 24/7 to get lifesaving materials to the frontlines. The City has now received all 2,500 ventilators promised by the federal government and has distributed nearly all of them to hospitals in need.\u201d\n\nFalse: Ventilators received from the federal government were not \u201cstuck\u201d in a New York City warehouse but had been distributed to hospitals within a day\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
