But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, each of us will have two ideas.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Shaw ever said or wrote this saying.\n\nShaw was an Irish playwright and political activist who lived from 1856 to 1950. He wrote more than 60 plays, including \u201cMan and Superman,\u201d \u201cPygmalion\u201d and \u201cSaint Joan,\u201d and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1925.\n\nHowever, nowhere in any of these works, or any of Shaw\u2019s others, does the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post appear. A search of Yale University\u2019s collection of his correspondence and manuscripts didn\u2019t return any results either.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of thing Shaw would say although he did like mind games,\u201d Jay Tunney, author of \u201cThe Prizefighter and the Playwright: Gene Tunney and Bernard Shaw,\u201d said in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cIn fact he was highly analytical. But this doesn\u2019t feel like him.\u201d\n\nRichard Dietrich, the former president of the International Shaw Society, was not familiar with the quote either, telling the DCNF in an email, \u201cI\u2019ve never come across that, so I suspect that it\u2019s just one more of dozens of misattributions to Shaw that you\u2019ll find on the internet.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced the expression back to a 1917 magazine advertisement, though variations may have appeared earlier. In this early version, the word \u201cdollar\u201d was used instead of \u201capple.\u201d\n\nCharles Brannan, the secretary of agriculture at the time, also employed a similar expression during a 1944 talk show appearance, where he discussed the sharing of knowledge and ideas with other countries, according to Quote Investigator. It is possible that he popularized the version that uses the word \u201capples\u201d and may even have originated it.\n\nThe saying was first attributed to Shaw during a 1974 speech given at a Library Administrators Conference, according to Quote Investigator.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
