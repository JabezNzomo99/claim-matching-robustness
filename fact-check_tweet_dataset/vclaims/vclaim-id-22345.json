No, that's not true: the story originated on a known South African satire website. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by News Updates South Africa on August 23, 2018 titled \"\"I am sending troops to South Africa, and they will not leave until the killings stop and the land issue is resolved', Donald Trump - News Updates South Africa\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced today that he will be sending troops to South Africa to help stabilize the country. The announcement came soon after Trump's recent tweet stating that the US government will closely monitor land seizures and the killing of farmers in the country.\n\nNo reputable news source made any mention of the news, which is not surprising since News Updates South Africa comes with an \"About Us\" page that says:\n\nThis indicates the story is not true.\n\nTrump recently did comment on the situation in South Africa via this tweet, but so far he has not announced anything about moving troops there:\n\nWe wrote about newsupdatessa.site before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Malema Did NOT Say Whites Should Not Be Allowed in Shopping Malls\n\u2022 Fake News: Floyd Shivambu Did NOT Say \"When we rename South Africa to Azania, we will require all whites and Indians to reapply for citizenship and adopt African names, else they will be loaded on boats and deported\"", "lang": "en"}
