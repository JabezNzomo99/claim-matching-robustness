The figure is just for GP registrations in England and Wales rather than the whole of the UK (it\u2019s about 6.6 million including Northern Ireland and figures for Scotland aren\u2019t available).\n\nThese were the latest figures available again at the time the claim was posted on Facebook, but newer data is now available covering 2008 to 2018, which shows the same figure for England and Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nBut the number of registrations isn\u2019t the same as the number of migrants. That\u2019s because for most of the period it covers, this measurement could have double counted some immigrants who registered at one GP, moved homes within England and Wales, and then registered at another.\n\nNHS Digital, which collects the figures, also told us it doesn\u2019t know to what extent this double counting occurred. The number might also include UK citizens who left the country for more than three months before returning to live in the UK and register with a new GP.\n\nThe figure doesn\u2019t factor in how many of these GP registrations were for people who only stayed in the country for a short period. Because of this, it\u2019s not a very good way of measuring how much the population has grown because of immigration.\n\nOther measures suggest fewer than 6.5 million people have immigrated to the UK between 2007 and 2017, although there are significant questions over how reliable some of those figures are.\n\nThe figure also doesn\u2019t come from the Lancet, it comes from data collected by NHS Digital and published by the Office for National Statistics.\n\nWe\u2019ve got more information on the claim in our original factcheck here.", "lang": "en"}
