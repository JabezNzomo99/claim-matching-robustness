His core factual assertion that \u201ccrime in Germany is way up\u201d is the opposite of true.\n\nThe people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\nOn the contrary, in May, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer \u2014 who is actually the leader of the immigration-skeptical forces inside Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cabinet \u2014 released new data indicating that Germany\u2019s crime rate had fallen to its lowest level since 1992.\n\nImmigration is a difficult issue for the so-called \u201cgrand coalition\u201d between the main German center-right and center-left parties Merkel oversees. This is because Merkel\u2019s policies are unpopular with the right wing of her own party, and especially with its Bavarian affiliate that, for various historical reasons, has a good measure of institutional autonomy. But it\u2019s just not true that crime is up.", "lang": "en"}
