But based on the number of arrests alone, Mr. Trump\u2019s estimate of \u201cthousands\u201d is impossible.\n\nIn the 2017 fiscal year \u2014 which began in October 2016 and ended in September 2017 \u2014 796 members of MS-13, a transnational gang that has ties to El Salvador, were arrested, and 405 were arrested in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, data that ICE provided to The New York Times shows.\n\nIn all, that\u2019s about 1,200 MS-13 members, and it\u2019s likely not all of them have been removed. The time between an arrest and deportation can vary greatly, and backlog has stalled the process. In 2017, the average wait time for a hearing where a judge may order deportation was 685 days, according to data from TRAC, a research institute at Syracuse University.\n\nThe number of MS-13 members who were arrested in the 2017 fiscal year was higher than the previous eight years, but ICE arrested more than 1,100 in the 2008 fiscal year and almost 1,300 in 2007. Those figures contradict Mr. Trump\u2019s previous claims that \u201crecords\u201d were set.", "lang": "en"}
