The attackers could be seen beaing up the vendors and abusing them by making anti-Kashmir remarks. The video which soon went viral led to the Lucknow police arresting four men including a Bajrang Sonkar, a history sheeter and member of a local right wing organisation.\n\nIn a press conference held by the Kalanidhi Naithani, Senior Superitendent of Police, Lucknow regarding the incident, he said that the four people have been arrested and that they are members of the Vishwa Hindu Dal trust, a local right wing group run by Ambuj Nigam.\n\nBOOM looked for the Vishwa Hindu Dal (VHD) on Facebook and found an unverified but claims to be the official page of the Vishwa Hindu Dal. In the cover photo of the page, we also noticed Bajrang Sonkar on the extreme right. The VHD could not be reached despite repeated attempts.\n\nNaithani in his press conference added that Sonkar has a few criminal cases.\n\nBOOM scanned through the profile of Bajrang Sonkar on Facebook and found many posts that are communal in nature. A recent post by Sonkar is an appeal to the public to join his fight, \"for Hindus and the Indian Army.\"\n\nAnother post by Sonkar says that if India captures Pakistan, he has sole right on Prime Minister Imran Khan's wife Reham Khan. He says in Hindi that Reham Khan \"will be his and no one else's\". The post which went viral, Sonkar signs off as, \"Mafia, Vishwa Hindu Dal.\"", "lang": "en"}
