This has been criticised by Advance NZ co-leader Billy Te Kahika Jr, who has earlier made inaccurate statements that the Defence Force had been granted the power to enter private residences without a warrant.\n\nDuring an interview on Newshub Nation on Three on August 29, Mr Te Kahika said the power of the military had been expanded and \u201cwe\u2019ve got people\u2019s rights and freedoms being eroded\u201d. (Video mark 8min 32secs).\n\n\u201cSo now, it was announced the other day that military staff now have extra powers similar to that of a constable while managing a detention centre,\u201d Mr Te Kahika said. (Video mark 8min 55secs)\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Te Kahika\u2019s statement that military staff have been granted powers similar to a police constable.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s quarantine and managed isolation facilities have been partially staffed by the Defence Force since at least June 19, when numbers were doubled to 72. This was done after the government was criticised for allowing two people to leave managed isolation early, without being tested for COVID-19.\n\nThe role of the Defence Force has expanded significantly since, with Defence Force personnel increasingly taking over from private security guards in high risk facilities.\n\nMembers of the Armed Forces have also been stationed at vehicle checkpoints since August 12, supporting police at roadblocks in Auckland during the recent Level 3 lockdown.\n\nUntil recently Defence Force personnel reportedly had no more powers than a security. However, their powers were expanded on August 25, when Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield authorised members of the Armed Forces to have the power to \u201cgive direction\u201d and \u201cto direct persons to provide identifying information\u201d.\n\nThese powers were granted by Dr Bloomfield under COVID-19 Public Health and Response Act 2020, which was passed on May 23 to enable the government to enforce measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nUnder Section 18 of the Act, the Director-General can authorise employees of the Crown to be an \u201cenforcement officer\u201d and grant them a range of powers, including to enter a property without a warrant.\n\nHowever, on August 25, Dr Bloomfield only extended powers under Section 21 and Section 23 of the Act to members of the Armed Forces. This gives them the power to instruct a person not to break an order under the Act and the power to direct a person to provide identifying information, including their full name, full address, date of birth, occupation, and telephone number.\n\nNot following these directions becomes an offence under the Act. These powers had earlier been granted to WorkSafe inspectors, Aviation Security officers and Customs officers.\n\nSo how does this compare with the powers of a police constable?\n\nUniversity of Otago law professor Andrew Geddis has written extensively on NZ\u2019s lockdown laws and told AAP FactCheck via email, that the powers granted to the Defence Force fall well short of those of a constable.\n\nHe said the key difference is that a constable has the power to arrest and detain people.\n\n\u201cFailing to comply with an enforcement officer\u2019s directions/requirement is an offence under the legislation \u2013 people \u2018have\u2019 to do what they say, or else risk prosecution,\u201d Prof Geddis said.\n\n\u201cBut, and this is a pretty key difference, the military have no power to directly force people to comply with their directions/requirements.\n\n\u201cThey have no legal power to arrest or detain, no right to physically restrain, etc. Only constables may do so (under their general policing powers).\u201d\n\nProf Geddis explained that while a member of the military can stand at the entrance of a managed isolation facility and ask people to identify themselves, they can\u2019t enforce these directions.\n\n\u201cIf a person ignores them, they can\u2019t grab them and hold them. Instead, they have to call in the police to effect an arrest,\u201d he told AAP FactCheck.\n\n\u201cAs the defining feature of the police is the power to arrest and detain, saying that members of the military now have \u201csimilar\u201d powers is false.\u201d\n\nAAP FactCheck found the military have not been given powers similar to that of a police constable. While the powers of Defence Force personnel working at quarantine and managed isolation facilities have been expanded, there are still crucial differences between the powers of a police constable. While members of the Defence Force can legally require people to give basic personal information and order them to obey COVID-19 laws, they cannot enforce these orders like a police constable can. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
