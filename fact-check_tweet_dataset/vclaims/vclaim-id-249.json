ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS / REFUGEES LIVING IN BRITAIN GET A TOTAL YEARLY BENEFIT OF \u00a329,900\u201d. (here)\n\nThis is not correct. Illegal immigrants cannot claim benefits in the UK. A person is classed as an illegal immigrant when they do not have the right to remain in the country.\n\nThe UK government, in response to a petition urging it to \u201cStop all benefits to illegal immigrants completely\u201d, said in 2015: \u201cIllegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers are not entitled to, and do not get, benefits from the UK\u2019s welfare system\u201d.(here)\n\nRefugees, on the other hand, can claim benefits, but no more than any British person. Refugees are defined as asylum seekers whose asylum application has been successful.\n\nA House of Commons report states that they are entitled to \u201csocial security benefits and tax credits on the same basis as UK nationals.\u201d (here)\n\nBut these benefits are typically capped well short of \u00a329,900. For instance, the maximum amount a single person living outside London can receive in benefits is capped at \u00a313,400 a year, or \u00a315,410 if they live in London. (here)\n\nThis rises to \u00a320,000 a year for couples or single parents with children living outside London, and to \u00a323,000 a year in London.\n\nAlthough the benefits cap doesn\u2019t apply to some people, this has nothing to do with refugee status. Instead, factors like being over state pension age or receiving Universal Credit because of a disability that stops you from working can make a person exempt. (here)\n\nThe benefits pensioners can be eligible for include free bus travel, the means-tested pension credit and a state pension.\n\nA basic state pension can be claimed by a man who was born before 6 April 1951 or a woman who was born before 6 April 1953. The full basic state pension is \u00a3134.25 a week, or \u00a36,981 a year. (www.gov.uk/state-pension) To get the full basic state pension you need a total of 30 qualifying years of National Insurance contributions or credits. (here)\n\nPensioners born after the above dates can draw the new state pension of up to \u00a3175.20 a week, or \u00a39,110 a year. A person needs 35 qualifying years to get the full rate, but can receive a proportion of it if they have between 10 and 35 qualifying years. (www.gov.uk/new-state-pension)\n\nThe claim on social media refers to a pensioner who has worked for 45 years. Such a person would presumably be entitled to a full state pension, meaning they would receive a minimum of \u00a36,981, as well as any other benefits they may be eligible for.\n\nFalse. Illegal immigrants cannot receive benefits. While refugees are eligible to the same benefits as UK nationals, these are capped far below \u00a329,900. A pensioner who has worked for 45 years would be entitled to a minimum of \u00a36,981 a year.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
