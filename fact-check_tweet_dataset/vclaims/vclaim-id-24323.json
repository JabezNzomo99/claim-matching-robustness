The recent one is his alleged comments on the Pulwama attack. A post on Facebook claims that Abhinandan blamed the BJP government for the Pulwama attack. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Abhinandan said, \u2018Pulwama attack has been planned by the BJP government. Imran Khan is helping Modi to win elections by allowing fake bombings at Balakot\u2019. Fact: Abhinandan did not make any such comments. No credible source has been found to authenticate the claim. Also, Abhinandan did not give any interview after his release. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for any comments on Pulwama by Abhinandan on Google, it was found that he did not make any such comments. Actually, he did not give any interview since his release from Pakistan\u2019s custody. Only a few photos posted by Defence Ministry and a recent selfie video related to Abhinandan can be found on social media. Even if he had really commented on Pulwama, it would have been reported by all the major newspapers and channels in India. So, the comments in the post were not made by Abhinandan.\n\nHence, comments blaming BJP for the Pulwama attack have been falsely attributed to Abhinandan.", "lang": "en"}
