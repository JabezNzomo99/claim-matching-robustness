It's very difficult to get a fix on even the level of direct compensation from human rights cases, let alone the wider effects on society.\n\nFigures in the billions rely on an attempt to cost particular laws, which is hard, and connect those laws to a particular court judgment, which is even harder.\n\nThe Sun's more concrete figure, while correct as a cost to taxpayers from European Court of Human Rights judgments, isn't the same as the amount of compensation received by people successful at the court. It includes reimbursed legal costs and general expenses.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning the assumption often underpinning these exercises: that any such payments are unmerited. Human rights advocates might argue that a government found to have violated somebody's fundamental rights should jolly well pay up.\n\nClaims that taxpayers have been, and still are, on the hook for billions of pounds as a result of judgments by the European Court of Human Rights derive from a report published in 2010 by the TaxPayers' Alliance.\n\nThese are said to be the implementation costs of responding to the judgments, by changing a law or policy so that it is human rights-compliant (\u00a317.3 billion up to 2010), and the societal costs of the Court fostering a \"compensation culture\" (\u00a325 billion). The Mail's \u00a342 billion is the total of these two, while the Express's \u00a37.1 billion is an annual figure for the second element.\n\nNot something that can be reliably quantified\n\nIt's difficult to prove that a particular human rights case triggered a particular policy response, and then ascribe a cost to that policy.\n\nThere are instances where we can draw a reasonably strong link between a case and a cost to the taxpayer. Matthews v UK was cited in Parliament and by the House of Commons Library as the reason for a change to the law giving older men travel concessions on public transport at the same age as women (60, where it had been 65 for men).\n\nIt's also easier to calculate the cost of a change like this, because it was expanding an existing scheme.\n\nBut in most other cases that significantly contributed to the report's total, neither the causal link nor the way the costs have been calculated are conclusive. Human rights academics have dismissed the report as \"methodologically flawed\".\n\nFor instance, a decision on the deportation of a HIV-positive criminal is said to have facilitated \"ill people travelling to the UK for free treatment\".\n\nBut there's no evidence given to prove a link between this case and the wider phenomenon of 'health tourism'. The man concerned was already in the country when he was diagnosed as terminally ill.\n\nHis case is different to the situation faced by a sick person in another country who may want to travel here for treatment. If they aren't dying, the case doesn't necessarily apply to their situation, and it's not obvious that many people would be able to travel in such a condition.\n\nThere's even less evidence to cost 'health tourism' at \u00a360 million a year, as the report does.\n\nIt also links the case of Gaskin v UK, decided by the Court in 1989, to the costs imposed by the Data Protection Act 1998.\n\nIt gives these at \u00a3742 million a year, plus one-off costs of over \u00a31.1 billion\u2014in total, \u00a39.3 billion between 1998 and 2009.\n\nThese figures are a 1997 estimate, made before the Act passed. A 2012 estimate came to the much lower figure of \u00a353 million annually.\n\nWhile the EU mentioned human rights as a reason for bringing in the Directive that lead in turn to the Data Protection Act, it's a stretch to say that there would be no data protection law in force at all if it weren't for Mr Gaskin's case specifically.\n\nAll in all, it's hard to disagree with the government's assessment that \"accurate estimates\" of the costs arising from these cases are impossible.\n\nThe Express's figure of \u00a37.1 billion connected with human rights \"court rulings\" every year is flatly wrong. The TaxPayers' Alliance ascribes this to a more general \"compensation culture\", not specific judgments, and that concept is different from human rights law anyway.\n\nCompensation for harm\u2014such as personal injury\u2014suffered due to someone else's wrongdoing is down to the law of tort. An expert in that field, P.S. Atiyah, has argued that it needs reform. That's an entirely separate debate to that on human rights.\n\nThere can be compensation involved in human rights cases, but the sums involved are nothing like the TaxPayers' Alliance \"ball park figure of \u00a35 billion annually\".\n\nThe Sun gives a more plausible figure of \u00a34.4 million for the direct cost of successful cases against the British government at the European Court of Human Rights, since 1998.\n\nThis total includes legal costs and expenses. If what you want to know is how much the 200 or so people who won a case actually received in compensation, the Court makes it more like \u00a31.7 million (as of 2013).\n\nThat's only cases taken to Europe, of course, and compensation for breach of human rights can be awarded by a court here at home. There's no record of how many such cases there are and how much compensation they generate.\n\nBut the level of compensation has to be \"relatively modest\". A judge deciding a case last month awarded \u00a310,000 each to a couple whose children were wrongly kept in foster care by Hackney Council. That's about the price of a used Skoda.\n\nWe removed a reference to the legal scope of the Gaskin case, pending its replacement with a more precise explanation.", "lang": "en"}
