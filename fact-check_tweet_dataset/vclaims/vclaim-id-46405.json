They claim that COVID-19 is not caused by a virus but by bacteria; that the supposed bacteria is \u201camplified\u201d by fifth-generation (5G) technology; and that ventilators and intensive care units (ICUs) were \u201cnever needed\u201d in treating the disease because it can be fought with \u201cantibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.\u201d\n\nThere are at least two versions of the false posts going around, both claiming that Italian pathologists made the discovery by conducting autopsies on COVID-19 casualties. One specified that the study was done on 50 corpses from the cities of Bergamo and Milan.\n\nThere is no known study publicly stating that COVID-19 is pulmonary thrombosis. The closest is a report published April 22 in online health research repository medRxiv, which came with a note that the study was not peer-reviewed, meaning it is \u201cyet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.\u201d\n\nThe study looked into lung tissues of 38 -- not 50 -- corpses of individuals who had severe COVID-19 from two hospitals in the aforementioned cities. Blood clotting was observed in 33 patients. However, it did not conclude that COVID-19 was disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\nIn an interview with Poynter Institute\u2019s Politifact, Aurelio Sonzogni, one of the authors of the study, said his research only found lung damage due to blood clotting as \u201cone possible effect of COVID-19.\u201d He also clarified that his study does not intend to \u201ccontradict the fact that COVID-19 is a virus that cannot be treated with antibiotics.\u201d\n\nThe posts claimed that COVID-19 is caused by a bacteria. Not true.\n\nThe disease comes from contracting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several studies on the virus\u2019 genome structure published on The Lancet journal, The New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection, among others, categorize SARS-CoV-2 as a member of the Betacoronavirus genus, as it exhibits similar characteristics with SARS-like coronaviruses.\n\n5G does not \u2018worsen\u2019 the disease\n\nOne version of the post included a conspiracy theory claiming that 5G technology \u201camplifies\u201d the bacteria that causes COVID-19, and causes inflammation and hypoxia in patients. Hypoxia is a condition where one\u2019s body tissues do not have enough oxygen.\n\nThe WHO has said the disease is viral and not bacterial in nature, although it has clarified that patients may get bacterial infections. The 5G claim is inaccurate. A WHO information page about 5G said \u201cno adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies.\u201d Claims about 5G causing inflammation and hypoxia in COVID-19 patients have no basis.\n\nA more elaborate conspiracy about 5G and COVID-19 was debunked by VERA Files Fact Check in May. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: FB posts float CONSPIRACY theory on 5G, RFID link to COVID-19)\n\nBoth versions of the inaccurate posts bragged that ventilators and ICUs were \u201cnever needed\u201d to treat COVID-19 because the Italian researchers discovered that \u201cthe way to fight it is with antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.\u201d Aspirin was explicitly mentioned.\n\nCurrently, there is still no drug or vaccine that can cure or prevent the coronavirus disease. The drugs mentioned in the online posts were meant to address related infections in COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe WHO and the United States Food and Drug Administration have constantly been reminding people that antibiotics will neither prevent nor treat COVID-19, as it is effective only against bacterial infections, such as bacterial pneumonia in some COVID patients.\n\nIn addition, WHO\u2019s interim guidance on the clinical management of COVID-19 released May 27 discourages antibiotic therapy for patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 \u201cunless there is clinical suspicion of a bacterial infection,\u201d because \u201cantibiotic overuse\u201d might make a patient prone to producing \u201cmultidrug-resistant bacteria.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, WHO has recommended the use of the drug Heparin, an anticoagulant, since January this year. Heparin is a blood thinner that could help prevent thrombosis-related complications in patients.\n\nThere have been mixed opinions in different countries about the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen because of worries that it may increase susceptibility to the virus or worsen symptoms in current COVID-19 cases. NSAIDs can reduce pain and inflammation, among other things.\n\nA research published May 24 in the Pain and Therapy journal concluded that there certainly are cases where NSAIDs should not be used but there was \u201cno strong evidence that NSAIDs must be avoided in all patients with COVID-19.\u201d WHO has similarly not discouraged the use of NSAIDs.\n\nLastly, the use of mechanical ventilators in ICUs remains a strong recommendation for COVID-19 patients experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), according to WHO\u2019s May 27 clinical guidance. ARDS happens when fluid builds up in the air sacs in one\u2019s lungs.\n\nVentilators help a person experiencing difficulty in breathing by moving air in and out of his or her lungs. It is usually an aid for respiratory failure, which is one of the leading causes of deaths among COVID-19 patients.\n\nItaly has not yet defeated COVID-19\n\nThe more recent iterations of the misleading posts also made two false claims concerning Italy: that the country has \u201cdefeated\u201d the disease and that its Health ministry has changed its treatment protocols to use aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs for COVID-19 cases.\n\nAs of June 14, there were 26,274 active cases in Italy, according to its Health department\u2019s case tracker.\n\nItaly\u2019s Ministry of Health website as of June 3 explicitly states that \u201cantibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections,\u201d and reminds people to not take antiviral drugs and antibiotics unless prescribed by a doctor.\n\nThe first version of the false and misleading posts circulated as early as May 1, titled \u201cAutopsies Prove that COVID-19 is a Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation.\u201d A copy of it could be found on website Gistflash, which could have reached over 990,000 netizens. Several accounts have republished its text as Facebook status updates.\n\nThe second version titled, \u201cHow Italian doctors disobeyed WHO and discovered the secrets of coronavirus,\u201d could have reached more than 5.2 million people on social media. Its earliest copy was posted on the website Efogator, and shared as early as May 23. It has a version converted into a video, which two netizens have asked VERA Files Fact Check to look into.\n\nTop traffic generators of the first version of the misleading posts are all public FB groups: OFFICIAL Q / QANON, 99% unite Main Group \"it's us or them\", and Italians For President Donald J Trump.\n\nPhilippine-based FB groups Tulfo Brothers Worldwide and Dugong Bayani Pinoy ako DU30 Online Warriors, with FB page Hayri G\u00f6zl\u00fckgiller, generated the most traffic for the posts\u2019 second version.\n\nGistflash was created last May 2, Efogator in November 2014.", "lang": "en"}
