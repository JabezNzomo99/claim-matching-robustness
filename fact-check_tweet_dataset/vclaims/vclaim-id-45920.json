A spokesperson for Virgin Media said it never had any parts with the \u201cCOV-19\u201d label.\n\nIn the video, a man films himself talking while wearing a hard hat and a face mask near what appears to be a telecommunications tower.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know the best way to do this, but we\u2019re working erecting 5G masts on towers like the one behind me for the past few weeks while everyone else has been in lockdown,\u201d the man claims. \u201cWe don\u2019t crack open these kits because we\u2019re explicitly asked not to, but perhaps the best thing is for me to show you.\u201d\n\nHe holds up a circuit board with \u201cCOV-19\u201d inscribed on a silver part in the corner and speculates about its purpose, saying that he has \u201cread all that stuff online about coronavirus and COVID-19.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show People In China Tearing Down A 5G Pole To Stop COVID-19)\n\nHowever, the circuit board in question is not a piece of 5G equipment, but rather part of an old set top TV box, according to Virgin Media spokesperson Luke Stallard.\n\n\u201cThat is a board from a very old set top TV box and which never featured any component parts inscribed/stamped/printed or otherwise with COV 19,\u201d Stallard told the Daily Caller via email. \u201cIt has absolutely no relation with any mobile network infrastructure, including that used for 5G.\u201d\n\nReuters reported that the circuit board comes from an old Virgin Media cable box whose casing can be seen on the hood of the vehicle at the end of the video. The British telecommunications company has since discontinued providing that type of set top box to its customers, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19 has been debunked by the World Health Organization and other experts.", "lang": "en"}
