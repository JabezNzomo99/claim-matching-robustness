However, the quote does not appear in this work or any of his others.

Kennedy also attributed a version of the quote to Dante in several of his speeches, according to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. (The library notes, however, that the quote was based on an interpretation of Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno.\u201d)\n\nSeveral decades earlier, in 1917, a North Carolina newspaper quoted the religious speaker W. M. Vines as saying, \u201cDante, in his \u2018Inferno,\u2019 put those who are neutral in the everlasting fight between right and wrong in the lowest place in hell.\u201d\n\nThis statement from Vines was the Christian speaker\u2019s attempt at capturing, in his own words, an idea from Dante\u2019s \u201cThe Divine Comedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn conclusion,\u201d Quote Investigator writes, \u201cthis quotation did not appear in \u2018Inferno\u2019 by Dante Alighieri, and it does not accurately reflect the location of neutral beings in Dante\u2019s elaborate eschatology. Nevertheless, QI conjectures that the statement evolved from a flawed re-interpretation of Dante\u2019s work.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
