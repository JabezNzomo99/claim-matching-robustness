(Turkey considers elements of this force to be a terrorist threat.) To prevent a Turkish invasion, the United States persuaded the SDF to pull back up to nine miles from the Turkish border. In August, the SDF destroyed its own military posts after assurances the United States would not let thousands of Turkish troops invade. But then Trump tossed that aside.\n\nTrump frequently and misleadingly frames this as a \u201chundreds of years\u201d conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. There has been a hundred-year effort to create a Kurdish state in the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, with the Kurds frequently manipulated by great powers seeking to flex their muscles against a particular nation, such as Iraq. The United States, for instance, spent $16 million promoting a rebellion in Iraqi Kurdistan in the early 1970s, only to step aside when the Shah of Iran (then a U.S. ally) decided to cut a border deal in 1975 with Iraq. \u201cThere is confusion and dismay among our people and force,\u201d the Kurdish leadership cabled the CIA. \u201cOur people\u2019s fate in unprecedented danger. Complete destruction hanging over our head. No explanation for all of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave away my salary. It\u2019s, I guess, close to $450,000. I give it away. Nobody ever said, \u2018He gives away his salary.\u2019 Now it comes up because of this. But I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. \u2026 They actually say that George Washington may \u2014 may have been the only other president to do \u2014 but see whether or not Obama gave up his salary.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoral was setting records when I bought it, because I owned it for a period of time. Setting records. It was going to \u2014 there was nothing like it. It was making a fortune. And then what happened? I announce I\u2019m going to run for office, right? And all of a \u2014 and I say we got to build a wall, we got to have borders, we\u2019ve got to have this, we\u2019ve got to have that. All of a sudden, people \u2014 some people didn\u2019t like it. They thought the rhetoric was too tough. And it went from doing great to doing fine. It does very nicely now. It\u2019s actually coming back, I understand, very strongly. But Doral was setting records.\u201d\n\nWe will leave it to readers to decide if the practices at the nation\u2019s founding are relevant today. Washington was one of the nation\u2019s largest landowners when he became president, though they were of dubious value, and he was a shareholder in the Patowmack Co., which aimed to build canals that would have given his land more value. Some historians have been critical \u2014 one wrote that Washington \u201cbetrayed private trusts in pursuit of private gain\u201d \u2014 but our colleague Joel Achenbach, in his 2005 book, \u201cThe Grand Idea: George Washington\u2019s Potomac and the Race to the West,\u201d concluded: \u201cThere is remarkably little tarnish to be mined in the Washington archive. We can be confident that his reputation as an honest man is not the product of a historical whitewash.\u201d\n\nTrump appears to be referring to a comment made by Green on MSNBC on May 6, 2019 when he was asked whether impeaching Trump would help him win re-election, given that polling at the time showed most Americans opposed: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if we don\u2019t impeach this president, he will get re-elected. If we don\u2019t impeach him, he will say he\u2019s been vindicated. He will say the Democrats had an overwhelming majority in the House and didn\u2019t take up impeachment. He will say we have a constitutional duty to do it if it was there and we didn\u2019t. He will say he\u2019s been vindicated.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
