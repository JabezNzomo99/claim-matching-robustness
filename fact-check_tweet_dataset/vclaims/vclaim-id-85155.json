He answered that he will prioritize the removal of 2 to 3 million people with criminal records who are \u201chere illegally\u201d \u2014 repeating a misleading claim that he used during the campaign. We checked out the facts.\n\n\u201cThe facts just don\u2019t support that [claim]. We know that there are close to 2 million \u2014 1.9 million, precisely \u2014 and they are the whole universe of foreign born people\u201d who are convicted of crimes, said Muzaffar Chishti, director of Migration Policy Institute\u2019s office at the New York University School of Law.\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump relied on analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies, an immigration-restriction organization that seeks to limit both illegal and legal immigration. The group is among three organizations that \u201cstand at the nexus of the American nativist movement\u201d and have ties to John Tanton, who helped found the group and whom the Southern Poverty Law Center described as \u201ca man known for his racist statements about Latinos, his decades-long flirtation with white nationalists and Holocaust deniers, and his publication of ugly racist materials.\u201d The Center for Immigration Studies has challenged SPLC\u2019s descriptions of Tanton.\n\nWhen we fact-checked a similar claim in Trump\u2019s Aug. 31 immigration policy speech, Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, had said most of the 1.9 million figure are undocumented, but she did not provide any specific data. She said it was based on information she received from a DHS source she could not reveal, which we cannot independently verify.\n\nA spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the agency \u201cis not able to provide an estimate of the number of illegal aliens presently in the U.S., nor can we confirm the percentage or number of those who have criminal convictions. ICE\u2019s statistics track only those aliens the agency has encountered and/or removed from the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe Trump spokesman also said that there are \u201cmany more who have committed crimes but fled or were not caught \u2014 that number could be astronomical. Closure rates for homicide [the rate at which homicide cases are solved, or \u201cclosed\u201d], for instance, only 50 percent, and illegal immigrants are more likely to flee.\u201d We asked for an estimate and a source of the number of illegal immigrants who may have committed homicide and fled, but did not receive a response.\n\nAnother option Trump has laid out is for his secretary of state to invoke authority to discontinue the granting of certain types of visas to countries that refuse to accept undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes. Trump has criticized Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department for not exercising this authority enough, and has pledged on his first day in office to order the cancellation of visas to the 23 countries (including China and India) which have refused to accept the return of criminal undocumented immigrants. There could be diplomatic consequences if he follows through with his pledge.\n\nThe data he is pointing to are of 1.9 million noncitizens who are convicted of crimes and are subject to removal. These noncitizens include people who are here illegally, are here on temporary visas or are lawful permanent residents. People who are lawfully in the United States can be removed if they are convicted of serious crimes. An independent think tank that analyzes immigration policy estimated that more than half of the 1.9 million people are convicted criminals who are not U.S. citizens, but lawfully in the country.\n\nPreviously, Trump used the 2 million figure but did not say all 2 million were in the country illegally. We awarded Two Pinocchios, because he stated it as fact without the caveats. This time, Trump went further by saying the 2 million are \u201chere illegally,\u201d and that there \u201ccould be even 3 million.\u201d We award him Three Pinocchios for distorting the facts further, even though we already pointed out the flaws with his use of the statistic.", "lang": "en"}
