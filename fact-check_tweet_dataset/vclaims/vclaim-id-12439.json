On the basis of this video, it has been alleged that Pakistan was firing at India from across the Line of Control (LoC) in Sialkot in the early hours of Wednesday.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is an unrelated three-year-old video.\n\nThe viral video in question was posted by an unverified page with the name 'BBC Urdu.EU' at 2.56 am on Wednesday. The post titled 'Current situation of Sialkot LOC' was viewed by nearly 10,000 Facebook users and shared 186 times as of the last update.\n\nThe dubious BBC Urdu page, which does not bear the original logo of BBC Urdu, has 51,000 likes. The original page of BBC Urdu has more than 6.6 million likes.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe video starts with a voice-over saying \"infantry can do what a man can do\" followed by rounds of firing at night. The video is around 30 seconds long.\n\nSearching with keywords \"infantry can do what a man can do\", we found the same video posted by multiple people in the past. The oldest video showing the same content was uploaded on October 5, 2016, by a YouTube account called 'Pakistani Military Clips'.\n\nAt around one minute-35 seconds, people can be heard screaming \"Pakistan zindabad\". The same video was posted by another user on YouTube on July 5, 2017, where people mentioned in the comments that this was \"Infantry fire power demo in Pakistan Military Academy\".\n\nAFWA tried to verify this information from the official website of the Pakistan Military Academy, however, the website has denied access to Indian servers.", "lang": "en"}
