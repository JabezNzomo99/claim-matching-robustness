There are two main problems with extrapolating in this way.\n\nThe first is that the 650,000 people on this app may not be representative of the UK population as a whole. For example, you might expect people with symptoms to be more interested in signing up in the first place compared to people who don\u2019t. A press release from King\u2019s College (published after the news articles above were written) said that young people are far more likely to use the app than older people.\n\nAs there\u2019s no evidence that the app\u2019s users accurately represent the general population, it\u2019s wrong to extrapolate the findings from the app up to the UK population level.\n\nThe second main problem is that even if users were representative of the UK population, having symptoms of Covid-19 doesn\u2019t mean that someone has the disease.\n\nThe main symptoms of Covid-19 are a high fever and a persistent cough. These are also symptoms of lots of other diseases. \n\n\n\nAnd, on the flipside, not having symptoms doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that someone isn\u2019t infected with the new coronavirus.\n\nThere have been various reports on what proportion of people with Covid-19 do not show symptoms. At this stage it\u2019s still not known how common this is, but one Italian academic found that between 50% and 75% of residents who tested positive in one town in Veneto, Italy did not show symptoms.\n\nSome of these issues are covered in the reporting, but extrapolating the figures in the first place goes way beyond what the evidence supports.", "lang": "en"}
