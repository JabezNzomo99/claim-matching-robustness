He had frostbite of the P*NIS after getting drunk and trying to have s*x with a SNOWMAN. Kenneth Gillespie is known to locals as a drunk and a bit of a lecherous type, but this latest episode has had dire consequences. He was found passed out clutching onto his frozen junk by neighbors at 1.30am on Sunday morning and they called the ambulance straight away. The doctor in charge of Mr. Gillespie, Dr. Marc Arnadeu said this to a local TV news crew: \u201cFrostbite of that area may sound funny but it is very serious indeed. Frostbite, of course, can cause infection and gangrene and ultimately this has led to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s member being amputated. It\u2019s very sad.\u201d The snowman is thought to be okay, though. It\u2019s since been rebuilt and cleaned \u2026 Some in Gillespie\u2019s neighborhood are less than pleased, though. One told the Montreal Gazette this: \u201c \u2026 Several people have already vowed to dismember him after what he did to the kids\u2019 snowman. He left a pile of empty bottles, a wrecked snowman and a trail of frozen man-juice in the middle of the community recreation ground. This b*stard\u2019s worse than Bill Cosby.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, the tale of the sexy snowman appeared to be typical hoax news cooked up to garner social media traction. But iterations of a near-identical claim had been published several years earlier by Uproxx, The Frisky, and several radio blogs, all of which aren\u2019t generally considered fake news sites.\n\nUproxx\u2019s 25 January 2013 item placed \u201cKenneth Guillespie\u201d in Britain and made no mention of neighbors referencing Bill Cosby (who was not widely accused of sexual misconduct until October 2014, long after the snowman tale began trekking across the Internet):\n\nRegardless, this dude from the UK is obviously a freak in every way, so of course he was able to stick his diseased dong into an ice sculpture and impale it mercilessly until shooting a load. Habitual drunkard Kenneth Guillespie, 64, was found half-naked and screaming in agony next to the remains of the five-foot snow sculpture. And when he arrived for treatment at North Central infirmary in Blackburn, shocked medics found the booze-soaked layabout was suffering from FROSBITE of the JOHNSON. Someone At the hospital said that \u201cKen\u2019s a regular visitor to A&E. Normally it\u2019s just bumps and scrapes \u2013 or someone has giving him an ass whoopin\u2019. \u201cOccasionally he\u2019ll get trapped in something or get an object wedged up him. But this is the most bizarre mishap yet.\u201d But The unemployed former postman may not remain in one peice if the return to the scene of his whitemarish coupling \u2014 as local residents are said to be on the warpath. Ian Jessop of the Ramsgreave and Brownhill Community Security said: \u201c \u2026 He left\u201d a pile of empty bottles, a wrecked snowman and a trail of frozen man-juice in the middle of the community recreation ground.\u201d\n\nMost accounts cited a (since-deleted) page on a web site called Busted in Acadiana which was dated 21 January 2013 and featured a (once widely-circulated) photograph of what appeared to be news article evidencing the claim:\n\nThat image led to the original source of the story, Sunday Sport, an outlet described by Wikipedia as somewhat akin to the Weekly World News as an unambiguous peddler of complete fabrications:", "lang": "en"}
