This is not true.\n\nIts content focused on a \u201cmeme\u201d using a Manila Bulletin photo of a woman during a protest that day against the controversial measure, spliced together with a doctored image of the ASG with text that read, \u201cMaraming Salamat Sa inyong taos pusong Suporta (Thank you very much for your heartfelt support).\u201d\n\nThe earliest traceable copy online of the ASG photo is a screengrab from a recording of the terrorist group aligning itself with ISIS in March 2016, uploaded on Indonesian website Merdeka.com.\n\nIn its headline, Asian Policy maliciously presented the claim in the meme as fact: \u201cAbu Sayyaf, pinasalamatan ang mga artista, politiko, atbp. na nag-rally para kondenahin ang Anti-Terror Bill (Abu Sayyaf thanked artists, politicians, etc., who rallied to condemn the Anti-Terror Bill).\u201d\n\nThe website itself said in the latter part of its story that the meme, also published on June 4, was \u201cjust for laughs.\u201d\n\nA look at the post\u2019s interactions on Facebook (FB) shows that Asian Policy\u2019s false headline has led some netizens to believe that the ASG indeed praised critics of the bill. One Facebook user said, \u201cIT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE CONNECTED.\u201d\n\nAnother netizen, referring to the rallyists, said, \u201cKaya tuwang tuwa mga iyan dahil marami silang kakampi, mga kagaya nilang ang gusto ay pabagsakin ang gobyerno (They are very happy because they have many allies who, like them, want to overthrow the government).\u201d\n\nFB and social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle detected Asian Policy\u2019s malicious post gaining traction on June 17, the same day the National Union of People\u2019s Lawyers announced it will challenge the Anti-Terrorism Bill at the Supreme Court once President Rodrigo Duterte signs it.\n\nThe bill was transmitted to the Office of the President on June 9 amid widespread criticism that it could be used to stifle dissent.\n\nThe story\u2019s top three online traffic generators on FB are pages DT and Bayan Ko Ph and group I love Basa Air Base, and could have reached over 1.7 million people.\n\nAsian Policy, created in August 2016, has previously been flagged by VERA Files Fact Check for producing misleading articles.
