It\u2019s something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don\u2019t want to do it out of principle. The people that took the course all signed \u2014 most, many, signed \u2014 report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.\u201d\n\nThere are three ongoing lawsuits, so we were curious about Trump\u2019s description that he \u201cwon most of the lawsuits,\u201d and wanted to know about this report card that all, most or many attendees signed. His campaign, as per usual, did not respond to our inquiry.\n\nThose who signed up for Trump University believed they would get insider knowledge about real estate investing, through mentors hand-picked by Trump. Some attendees were asked to raise their credit limits so they could pay for additional courses, they allege. Advertising materials were consistent with the Trump brand, quoting the real estate mogul making statements such as: \u201cI can turn anyone into a successful real estate investor, including you.\u201d\n\nSchneiderman\u2019s lawsuit blamed Trump University for running a scam program. Despite what was advertised, few instructors and mentors were successful real estate entrepreneurs, according to the lawsuit. In fact, many of them came to Trump University after their real estate investments caused them to declare bankruptcy. Former attendees filed complaints with attorneys general in several states, and 150 students signed affidavits in the Schneiderman lawsuit.\n\nThe plaintiff in one class-action suit paid for the $1,495 three-day seminar. He alleged that he was upsold to pay for the Gold Elite program for $35,000. Cohen said he would not have paid for any of them if he knew he wouldn\u2019t get insider knowledge or that Trump had no meaningful role in selecting instructors, as advertised.\n\nBut plaintiffs in one of the class-action lawsuits said Trump University\u2019s claim that it had a 95 to 98 percent student satisfaction rating was false. The evaluation was conducted during the initial three-day seminar or immediately after it, so many students gave positive ratings while believing they would eventually get long-term benefits through the mentorship and connections, the lawsuit said.\n\nTrump says he\u2019s \u201cwon most of the lawsuits.\u201d That\u2019s not the case. He appears to be referring to certain rulings by judges in the three lawsuits that were favorable to Trump. For example, one ruling in 2014 dismissed the motion for an injunction by Schneiderman. The motion was denied because Trump University is no longer operating.\n\nIn another victory for Trump, one of the main representatives of the class-action lawsuits asked the judge to remove her from the case, citing financial and emotional stress. The plaintiff made the request in February 2016, citing the intense media attention on her and the lawsuit that resulted from Trump\u2019s presidential run.\n\n[Update, Nov. 18: President-Elect Donald Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement to end all three lawsuits against him. The settlement included a $1 million penalty to New York state for the use of the word \u201cuniversity,\u201d which violated state law. Every victim will receive restitution, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said in a statement. Schneiderman called the settlement agreement \u201ca stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major vitory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.\u201d\n\nTrump also creates a misleading characterization of the plaintiffs filing the lawsuit against him, saying they signed an evaluation praising the program but are suing them just to get their money back. The charges in the lawsuit originate from attendees\u2019 complaints that they were misled into paying tens of thousands of dollars for a mentoring and training program that didn\u2019t deliver what it advertised.", "lang": "en"}
