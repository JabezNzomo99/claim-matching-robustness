In the video, people can be heard chanting, \u201c\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0924\u0941\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0948\u0930 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902, \u0935\u0938\u0941\u0902\u0927\u0930\u093e \u0924\u0947\u0930\u0940 \u0916\u0948\u0930 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u0938\u0941\u0902\u0927\u0930\u093e \u0924\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0915\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0947\u0917\u093e (We have nothing against you Modi, but Vasundhara won\u2019t be spared and because of Vasudhara, Modi will also have to bear the brunt -translated)\u201c. The tweet from the official INC handle has been retweeted more than 1100 times and \u2018liked\u2019 more than 1900 times.\n\nINC\u2019s social media head, Divya Spandana also claimed that Facebook wasn\u2019t allowing them to upload the said video.\n\nThe Congress twitter handle also took pot-shots at PM Modi. They tweeted, \u201cWhile PM Modi is gaining control of @facebook, he\u2019s losing control of his cadre. Open infighting on display at PM Modi\u2019s Jaipur rally.\u201d\n\nSachin Pilot, Rajasthan Congress President questioned the role of media for not showing \u201cparts of the allegedly \u2018successful\u2019 rally\u201d . A screenshot of the deleted tweet can be seen below.\n\nMany prominent people including Prashant Bhushan and Pranajoy Guha Thakurta also retweeted Divya Spandana\u2019s tweet.\n\nRealising their blunder, Congress twitter handle clarified that the video belonged to a CM Vasundhara Raje rally in Jhunjhunu, where the Prime Minister was also present.\n\nDivya Spandana also tweeted an apology which extended into whataboutery.\n\nGoogling the words \u201c\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0924\u0941\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0948\u0930 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902, \u0935\u0938\u0941\u0902\u0927\u0930\u093e \u0924\u0947\u0930\u0940 \u0916\u0948\u0930 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902\u201d and applying a time filter, we were about to find the original video.\n\nThe video was published by new4rajasthan YouTube channel on March 8, 2018.\n\nA report by Hindustan Times on March 8, 2018 stated, \u201cPublic anger against chief minister Vasundhara Raje was apparent on Thursday as a section of the crowd waved black flags at Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s public meeting in Jhunjhunu to launch the National Nutrition Mission and extend the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first faux pas by the official Congress twitter handle. In February 2018, Congress conducted a poll based on false, click-bait headlines which claimed that Centre was planning to introduce 13 digit mobile numbers. In a rush to score brownie points, the Congress social media team failed to check the veracity of the content and ended up losing face.", "lang": "en"}
