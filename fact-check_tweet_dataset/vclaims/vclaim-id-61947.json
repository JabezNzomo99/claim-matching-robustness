Also present in the picture are Finance Minister Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and her predecessor late Arun Jailtley.\n\nThe original picture was taken on November 05, 2015, when PM Modi launched Gold Sovereign Bond Scheme in the national capital. In the picture, PM Modi was originally holding framed Indian gold coin and bullion, bearing national emblem Ashok Chakra on one side and Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s image engraved on the other side.\n\nIn the above FAKE vs REAL collage, it is clear that Arun Jaitley and Nirmala Sitharam were cropped out of the picture while the subject in the frame was replaced with Rahul Gandhi\u2019s picture and text using photo editing software. The position of PM\u2019s hands is also a big give away nailing the FAKE image since it is clear that the original picture was morphed.\n\nIn conclusion, the above information proves that the picture in question is morphed.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
