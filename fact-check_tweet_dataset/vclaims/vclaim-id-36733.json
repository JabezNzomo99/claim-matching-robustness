They can be heard chanting \u201cTsai Ing-wen, step down\u201d in Mandarin throughout the clip.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe Office of the President was busy yesterday, even though there was no news about the demands for teaching materials about sexual liberation to be banned from campus, and for Tsai Ing-wen to step down. The fire of justice is now burning Tsai Ing-wen. All of those who attended today were parents.\u201d\n\nTaiwan is set to hold its quadrennial national election on January 11, 2020.

A sign which reads; \u201cSex liberation textbooks should be withdrawn from campus\u201d can be seen at the 37-second mark of the video. Another placard which reads; \u201cMarriage and family should be decided by everyone\u201d can be seen at the 43-second mark.\n\nBelow are screenshots taken from the Ctitv video at the 37-second mark (L) and the 43-second mark (R):\n\nThe same \u201cTsai Ing-wen, step down\u201d chant can be heard throughout the Ctitv video from the 33-second mark.\n\nThis article was published by Hong Kong newspaper Oriental Daily News about the same protest on the same date.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video at one-second mark (L) and an Oriental Daily News photo credited to photographer Wong Gong-hung (R):\n\nThe caption of the Oriental Daily News photo reads: \"A large number of anti-same sex marriage people turned to the Presidential Office Building to oppose, after the review was done at the Legislative Yuan.
