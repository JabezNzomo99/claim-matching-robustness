This is Hernebay today!!!!!\u201d\n\nThis is incorrect. One of the earliest public versions of the photo can be found in an article published on October 11, 2016. The piece discusses the \u201ceconomic activity\u201d of Herne Bay Air Show (here).\n\nOn March 30, 2017, a full-sized version of the photo was also uploaded to Instagram in a post about the air show (here).\n\nLocal news reports state that Herne Bay Airshow drew crowds of up to 100,000 between 2015-2017, until spiraling costs meant hosting the event was unsustainable\n\nFalse: the photo is old and can be seen in an article about Herne Bay Air Show in 2016.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
