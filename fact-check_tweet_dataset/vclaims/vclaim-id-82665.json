The caller further went on to say that the \"attacks would happen in trains\" and that \"19 terrorists are present in Ramanathapuram in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe call prompted Neelamani Raju, Director General and Inspector General of Police to issue a letter alerting her counterparts in the six states and one Union Territory informing them about the call.\n\nThe letter dated April 26, 2019 after giving out information about the caller states, \"he claims to have an information to the effect that major cities in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Pondicherry, Goa and Maharashtra will be hit by terror attacks.
