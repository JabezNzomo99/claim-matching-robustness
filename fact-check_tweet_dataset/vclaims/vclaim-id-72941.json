Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\nPaul, a potential 2016 contender, threw some jabs at Clinton in his at the Conservative Political Action Conference. In particular, he pointed to the United States\u2019 military involvement in the 2011 Libyan uprising, during Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state.\n\n\"Hillary's war in Libya is a perfect example,\" Paul said. \"Hillary's war made us less safe. Libya's less stable, and radical jihadists run amok. They swim in our swimming pool! Hillary's war in Libya allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists. As Hillary was declaring victory in Libya, Ambassador Stevens was pleading for more security.\"\n\nWe were intrigued by Paul\u2019s claim that radical Islamists got their hands on \"thousands\" of surface-to-air missiles.\n\nThe United States has to destroy tens of thousands of man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) around the globe. These over-the-shoulder surface-to-air missiles are easy to transport, and they pose serious danger to both commercial and military aircraft.\n\nWe found that it\u2019s likely terrorists have acquired a few Libyan MANPADS as a result of the conflict, but experts told us that there is no way they number in the thousands, or even dozens. Moreover, experts told us U.S. military involvement isn\u2019t to blame. American programs actually reduced by thousands the number of MANPADS accessible to terrorists.\n\n\"There is currently insufficient evidence to support the claim that radical Islamist groups have obtained \u2018thousands\u2019 of Libyan MANPADS,\" said Jeremy Binnie, the Middle East/Africa editor for .\n\nWhere did they go?\n\nThe 2011 U.S.-backed Libyan uprising -- part of the Arab Spring -- toppled the decades-long dictator Col. Muammar Gaddafi. At the time, the State Department estimated that Gaddafi had amassed about 20,000 MANPADS over 40 years.\n\nPaul's office sent us news reports from 2011 regarding the many MANPADS that went missing during the conflict; most were looted or destroyed. There was that they would end up in the hands of terrorists.\n\nThree years later, a found: \"Fears that terrorist groups would acquire these weapons have materialized.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Libyan MANPADS are known to have been smuggled into Chad, Lebanon, Mali and Tunisia, and authorities seized some found on a boat headed to Syrian insurgents. It\u2019s also , but unconfirmed, that they\u2019ve made their way to Egypt and Gaza. The MANPADS found in Mali and Tunisia were confirmed to be part of terrorists\u2019 arsenals.\n\nBut the idea that terrorists even had access to \"thousands\" of operable MANPADS is inexplicable, experts told us.\n\nFirst, Libya\u2019s 20,000 MANPADS were amassed over 40 years. The U.N. report said only some would still be usable today, despite their age. Others were acquired in pieces and cannot be reassembled because they are missing key components, said William Lawrence, a professor at George Washington University's Elliott School, who previously worked at the United States Embassy in Tripoli, Libya. The missiles destined for Syria, for example, did not include launchers.\n\nAlso, some of the weapons were controlled by anti-Gaddafi rebels, whom the U.S. supported, Lawrence added.\n\nAs for the claim that U.S. military involvement is somehow to blame for any missiles falling into the wrong hands, Libyan rebels were seen with looted MANPADS before the United States got involved in March 2011, Binnie said.\n\nThere is a long paper trail of America\u2019s role in drastically reducing Libya\u2019s MANPADS arsenal.\n\nThe United States military spent about $2 billion and several months in Libya intent on toppling Gaddafi. In the mission, NATO airstrikes , and in the process, according to the administration , eliminated thousands of MANPADS.\n\nFurther, a major aspect of the United States\u2019 diplomatic mission in Libya was a to aid the U.S.-backed transitional government in regaining control over Libya\u2019s weapons -- MANPADS in particular. The program -- which one called \"the most extensive effort to combat the proliferation of MANPADS in U.S. history\" -- recovered more than 5,000 Libyan MANPADS.\n\nAccording to the , getting rid of Libya\u2019s MANPADS were part of diplomatic discussions with Libya long before the 2011 uprising.\n\nSo let\u2019s review: Of those 20,000 MANPADS -- the United States recovered 5,000, NATO destroyed thousands, the U.S.-backed transitional government acquired many, and many are inoperable. While we know terrorists got their hands on a few, it\u2019s highly unlikely that they have \"thousands.\"\n\nThough the evidence overwhelmingly is against Paul, one line in the U.N. report threw us a curveball: \"Panel sources stated that thousands of MANPADS were still available in arsenals controlled by a wide array of non-state actors with tenuous or non-existent links to Libyan national authorities.\"\n\nIf thousands of MANPADS are still in the hands of \"non-state actors,\" could that mean thousands are available to terrorists? Not likely, Binnie said. While Libya has some radical Islamic non-state actors, the county also has numerous local tribes and militias (who aren\u2019t terrorists) that formed during the uprisings who likely stockpiled MANPADS.\n\n\"While Ansar al-Sharia and other radical groups affiliated to the Islamic State are operating in Libya, they remain very much a minority,\" Binnie said.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that there have been no documented instances of a shootdown using Libyan MANPADS since the 2011 conflict, said Karim Mezran, senior fellow at the Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.\n\n\"The Islamist groups have been bombed from the air daily in the last six months,\" Mezran said. \"If they have thousands (of MANPADS) why haven't they used them so far?\"\n\nPaul said that U.S. military involvement in Libya \"allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists.\"\n\nExperts told us that even though some terrorists are known to have a few Libyan surface-to-air missiles, the idea that they have \"thousands\" is extremely unlikely. While many of Libya\u2019s 20,000 surface-to-air missiles went missing during the conflict, thousands more were destroyed, recovered, rendered inoperable or believed to be in the hands of militias that aren\u2019t radical Islamic terrorists.\n\nIt\u2019s also incorrect to say the United States\u2019 military involvement caused these missiles to go missing. The weapon looting began before the United States and NATO showed up. And when they showed up, they destroyed or recovered many thousands. It\u2019s arguable that American involvement had the exact opposite effect than what Paul asserts.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate Paul\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
