This is false; the agencies responsible say they are operating under a long-standing provision to protect federal property, and legal experts dubbed such claims \u201ccrazy\u201d and foolish.\n\n\u201cWhen everyone just blames Trump but forgets who actually signed the law authorizing federal agents to snatch protestors off the streets in Portland,\u201d says a July 20, 2020 post.\n\nIt features a photo of Obama, who on December 31, 2011 signed the National Defense Authorization Act, a defense funding bill which that year incorporated controversial provisions governing the military detention of terrorist suspects.\n\n\u201cDo you know what the NDAA is?\u201d asked a July 20 Instagram post from Trump aide Lynne Patton, claiming the law allows the president \u201cto detain anyone he wants, for any reason he wants, without a trial.\u201d\n\nA July 23 search using social media analysis tool CrowdTangle showed the post was liked more than 5,000 times, and that it is no longer available.\n\nOther versions of the claim have been shared by accounts across the political spectrum, including here in a post that claims: \u201cTrump\u2019s secret police abductions use Obama\u2019s 2012 NDAA suspension of habeas corpus and rendition powers.\u201d\n\nOn June 26, Trump issued an executive order for federal agencies to provide \u201cpersonnel to assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property,\u201d some of which had been vandalized during protests against racism and police brutality -- most of them peaceful -- that erupted nationwide after the death in police custody of a black man named George Floyd in May.\n\nWhile protests have waned elsewhere, they have continued in Portland, and federal officers, including from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), were sent in as part of a task force under Trump\u2019s order.\n\nAsked about the legal authority under which CBP is deployed there, CBP Director of Media Lawrence \"Rusty\" Payne, in an email to AFP, cited 40 United States Code Section 1315, which allows for employees of the Department of Homeland Security to be designated for the protection of federal property.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, at the 9:10 mark of a July 21 press conference, said \u201cthe law is clear on what our authority entails,\u201d and read from the code cited by Payne. He added at the 45:05 mark that the authority \u201chas been on the books for decades, decades.\u201d\n\nStephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, in a tweet also said they are relying on that code. He called the posts blaming Obama \u201ccrazy\u201d and said that although the NDAA includes \u201ctroubling military detention provisions,\u201d they \u201chave literally *nothing* to do with what DHS is doing in Portland.\u201d\n\nDemocrats in Congress have asked for more clarity about the authority under which officers are acting.\n\n\"The legal basis for this use of force has never been explained,\u201d the Democratic chairs of relevant congressional committees wrote to the independent inspectors general for Homeland Security and Justice, asking them to investigate that and other aspects of the deployment. Both agreed to probes.\n\nJoe Margulies, a professor of law and government at Cornell, told AFP by phone that the claims in the social media posts \u201care remarkable for their foolishness.\u201d\n\nHe said the 2012 NDAA did not affect the right of detained Americans to a court hearing.\n\n\u201cSo to the extent that anybody picked up in Portland is a US citizen, there is nothing in the NDAA that year or any other year that deprives them of their right to go to court and challenge their detention,\u201d he said.\n\nEven non-citizens detained in the US have that right in habeas corpus, said Margulies, author of the book \u201cGuantanamo and the Abuse of Presidential Power.\u201d\n\nHe added that only Congress has the power to suspend it, which has never happened in the post-9/11 era. To suggest otherwise, he said, \u201cis just really irresponsible, in addition to being wrong. It's just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nAs for rendition, it began prior to 9/11 and involves \u201cpicking up someone in location X and detaining them in location Y separate from the criminal justice system. That's not what's going on in Portland. We've never rendered anybody in the United States.\u201d\n\nFederal agents\u2019 behavior in the city has led to allegations of abuse of power and comparisons with a \u201cbanana republic.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s mayor was tear gassed, and regular clashes have occurred between officers and what DHS calls \u201cviolent anarchists\u201d around the Federal Courthouse.\n\nOregon\u2019s Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum is suing 10 federal officers, Homeland Security, CBP and other federal law enforcement agencies, alleging they cannot be properly identified and have violated constitutional rights by detaining protesters in unmarked vehicles, and for \u201cremoving them from public without either arresting them or stating the basis for an arrest.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
