{"title": "Where are the UK's refugees?", "subtitle": "Reports that over 80% of councils have taken in no Syrian refugees under the main government resettlement programme are correct - up to a point.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-9116", "url": "https://fullfact.org/immigration/where-uk-refugees-councils/", "vclaim": "Where are the UK's refugees?\n\nA report by MPs on the migration crisis in Europe correctly reports the available statistics on which councils have accepted Syrian refugees under a government resettlement scheme.\n\nBut as the latest of those statistics only go up to March 2016, it\u2019s fair to raise doubts about whether they reflect the picture now. In addition, councils may have Syrian asylum seekers in their area through the regular asylum system.\n\nThe wide-ranging report was published today by the Home Affairs Select Committee, made up of MPs from different political parties. It welcomes the government\u2019s commitment to resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees in the UK by 2020, but expressed concern about \u201ca two-tier system among local authorities, with some providing support to Syrian refugees and others not doing so\u201d.\n\nCouncils don\u2019t have to take part in this government initiative, known as the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement scheme.\n\nIt\u2019s aimed at particularly vulnerable groups, such as \u201cwomen and girls at risk\u201d and \u201csurvivors of violence and/or torture\u201d.\n\n71 councils did accept Syrian refugees under the scheme between October 2015 and March 2016, while 320 councils didn\u2019t. As the Telegraph reports, that\u2019s over 80%.\n\n1,600 people have been resettled across those 71 councils. But as the MPs\u2019 report notes, another 250 people were resettled before October 2015. There\u2019s no data on where they ended up.\n\nNor do we know what\u2019s happened from April 2016 onward, and won\u2019t until the statistics are updated on 24 August.\n\nWe could also consider people who have applied for refugee status through the normal asylum process, rather than being brought to the UK under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme. Regular asylum applications have to be made in the UK.\n\nPeople who have made their way to the UK to make an asylum application can apply for accommodation and a small allowance for basic living expenses while their asylum application is being considered.\n\nThis \u2018Section 95 support\u2019 is more limited than the support available to Syrians accepted under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme.\n\nThere are figures on how many are receiving Section 95 support in different councils. These can\u2019t be broken down by nationality, although we do know that UK-wide there were around 1,300 Syrians as of March 2016.\n\nThe number of councils hosting or providing allowances to asylum seekers of all nationalities was over 200.\n\nCombined with those who have so far taken in Syrians under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme, the proportion of councils with no refugees or asylum seekers at all according to these statistics falls to 40%.\n\nThe Home Affairs Committee has previously reported on some councils seeming reluctant to accept asylum seekers.\n\nIn March 2016, it recommended that \u201cmore local authorities take part in the dispersal accommodation system and provide suitable accommodation for asylum seekers. Local authorities who have very few, and in many instances no, asylum seekers should be actively encouraged by Ministers to volunteer in the existing scheme\u201d.\n\nLooking at the big picture, the number of Syrian refugees and asylum seekers in the UK is approaching 10,000.\n\nOn top of the 1,900 recorded as having resettled up to March 2016, there have been 8,000 asylum applications from Syrians through the regular system since the conflict there began in 2011. The vast majority have been and will be accepted.\n\nThere are 4.8 million Syrian refugees, according to the United Nations.", "lang": "en"}
