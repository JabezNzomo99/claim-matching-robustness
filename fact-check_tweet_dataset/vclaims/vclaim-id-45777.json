Several users on Twitter have claimed that the bearded man in the picture is maulvi and MP Shafiqur Rahman Virk who performed Islamic rituals. \u2018Shafiqur Rahman Barq\u2019 is an MP from the Samajwadi Party.\n\nThe tweet below by Twitter handle @Callme_Varu_ has garnered close to 400 retweets.

He is the brother of Pandit Swaroop Kishen Reu, the first Kashmiri Pandit cricket umpire and a Padma Shri-awardee. According to a 2009 article on Kashmir Sentinel, Pandit Iqbal Kishen Reu \u201cwas employed in the railways and had a thorough knowledge of Kashmiri Karm Kand. He was a practising Kul Purohit and used to perform religious rituals of his jajmans, After performing the marriage of Priyanka Gandhi with Robert Vadra in 1996 according to K.P\u2019s traditions he left this job.\u201d Kul Purohit means family priest.\n\nThat Iqbal Kishan Reu was the Gandhi\u2019s family priest has also been stated in a feature on Priyanka Gandhi published in DailyO.\n\nAlt News spoke with Amrita Chak, ex-journalist, founding editor of Jacaranda Press, and a Kashmiri Pandit herself. \u201cWhile I do not know Mr Kishen Reu personally, I spoke with many individuals in the Kashmiri Pandit community and they confirmed to me that the person in the picture is Iqbal Kishen Reu,\u201d she informed.\n\nAccording to this tweet by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the viral photograph is of the morning puja on the day of her wedding. In other pictures of the puja provided to Alt News by a Congress office-bearer, she can be seen performing Hindu rituals.\n\nTherefore, a photograph of Kashmiri Pandit Iqbal Kishen Reu performing puja on Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s wedding day was shared on social media with the false claim that he is a maulvi who performed Islamic rituals. Portraying the Gandhi family as followers of Muslim tradition is a recurring piece of misinformation. A false claim earlier suggested that Islamic prayers were offered during Indira Gandhi\u2019s funeral. Popular misinformation that often recirculates is a false quote attributed to Jawaharlal Nehru where he is claimed to identify as \u201cMuslim by culture\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
