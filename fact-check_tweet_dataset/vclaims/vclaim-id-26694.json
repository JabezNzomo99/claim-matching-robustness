It claims that workers who have worked between 1990 to 2019 will be able to avail the benefit, provided their name is listed on the website (https://socialdraw.top/epf). \u201cThe workers who worked between the 1990 and 2019, have the rights to get the benefits of \u20b980 000 by EPFO of INDIA. Check if your name is in the list of the people who have the rights to withdraw this benefit: https://socialdraw.top/epf\u201d, reads the complete message.\n\nSeveral people have raised concerns over the authenticity of the message.\n\nEPFO\u2019s official Twitter handle has called out the fake website.\n\nThere are several red flags through which social media users can identify that the website is fake.\n\nWe found that the website is impersonating the official EPFO website. Government websites generally end with the domain name, .gov.in, whereas this website ends with .top domain. EPFO\u2019s official website is www.epfindia.gov.in.\n\nThe top portion of the website \u2013socialdraw.top/epf\u2013 is designed to resemble the official EPFO website by posting a screenshot of the same. None of the categories like UMANG, e-passbook, ECR/Returns/Payments is clickable.\n\nThe website asks users to answer a set of questions, like \u2018are you 18 years old\u2019, \u2018did you work in the period between 1990 to 2019\u2019, \u2018are you currently working somewhere\u2019, and so on. Subsequently, the user is asked to send the message to other people on WhatsApp, until a supposed threshold limit is reached. This is the typical method applied by shoddy websites to dupe people online and extract their personal information.\n\nMoreover, according to WHOIS, this website was created in mid-October this year.\n\nAlt News had debunked a similar fake website impersonating as Honda\u2019s website, which claimed that the company is giving away 300 Activa 5g scooters for free on Diwali.", "lang": "en"}
