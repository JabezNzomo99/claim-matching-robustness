It\u2019s just as fake now as it was then.\n\nRepublican pundit Brad Blakeman, formerly a senior staffer in the administration of President George W. Bush, posted this photo of a mansion Dec. 13, with these words: \"Pelosi\u2019s Mansion complete with a high perimeter wall, gun toting security and carbon spewing SUV\u2019s. \"Do as I say - NOT as I do. \"Leader Pelosi! Tear down that wall!\n\nBlakeman wasn\u2019t the only one to share the image. A group called President Trump Fans posted it, too, saying \"Walls for her house are ok...but not us.\" More than 2,700 people shared that post.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge problem here. That is not Pelosi\u2019s house. It\u2019s an exclusive property that in 2013 Forbes called San Francisco\u2019s \"most expensive home.\"\n\nWe checked with Pelosi\u2019s office and the San Francisco real estate records.\n\nHere is what her actual house looks like:\n\nNotice the absence of a wall. Our fellow fact-checkers at Snopes pointed out the truth about the walled-off home in February.\n\nThis Facebook post and all others like it are Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
