Congress also allocated $380 million to shore up election security in the 2018 omnibus with McConnell\u2019s support.\n\nThis post from Occupy Democrats, which received nearly 12,000 shares on Facebook, echoes concerns among Democrats who say that McConnell has not done enough to protect the country from foreign interference in the upcoming election.\n\n\u201cLeader McConnell would just like the issue to go away,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer recently told The New York Times. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that happen.\u201d\n\nAs majority leader, McConnell has wide discretion when it comes to deciding what legislation makes it to the Senate floor. As of late, he has refused to take up a number of bills related to election security, including H.R. 1, a sweeping proposal from House Democrats that, in part, would enhance security measures.\n\nMcConnell has defended his position by arguing that the true intent of many of the bills is to transfer control of elections from state and local authorities to the federal government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m open to considering legislation, but it has to be directed in a way that doesn\u2019t undermine state and local control of elections. The Democrats \u2026 would like to nationalize everything. They want the federal government to take over broad swaths of the election process because they think that would somehow benefit them,\u201d he said during a June interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham.\n\nNonetheless, McConnell has not blocked \u201cevery single piece of legislation\u201d related to election security as the meme suggests.\n\nOn June 3, the Senate passed the DETER Act by unanimous consent. The legislation would designate \u201cany alien who has engaged, is engaged, or at any time after admission engages in improper interference in a United States election\u201d as either deportable or inadmissible to the U.S.\n\n\u201cAs we saw in the 2016 elections, Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is attempting to strike at the very heart of the democratic values, freedoms, and liberty all Americans hold dear,\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a cosponsor of the bill, said in a statement. \u201cBy barring foreigners who improperly interfere in our elections from coming to the United States, the DETER Act sends a message to hostile nations across the world that the United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also supported the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, an omnibus spending bill that included $380 million to improve election security at the state level.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, about 8 percent of the money had been spent, with most of it going towards cybersecurity and voting equipment. It is projected that 85 percent of the money will be spent ahead of the 2020 presidential election, according to a spokesperson for the Election Assistance Commission.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
