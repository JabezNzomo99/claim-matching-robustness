If Lord Kinnock or\u2026 Lord Mandelson\u2026 or Chris Patten\u2026 began to publicly criticise the EU, their fat cat gold plated pensions would be withdrawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cDID YOU KNOW THAT SENIOR EMPLOYEES OF THE EU LOSE THEIR MASSIVE PENSION IF THEY CRITICISE THE EU IN PUBLIC? \u201cWhy do you think people like Blair and Kinnock NEVER say a bad word about the EU?\n\nA video from 2017 of LBC radio presenter Andrew Pierce talking about the pensions of senior EU employees has recently gone viral on twitter. Similar content has also been shared on Facebook, which includes a screenshot of a Daily Telegraph article from 2009 making a similar claim.\n\nIn the video, Mr Pierce claims that\u2014\u201cnot a word of exaggeration or distortion\u201d\u2014senior EU employees lose their pension if they criticise the EU.\n\nThis is exaggerated and distorted. It\u2019s true that there are rules on the conduct of current and former EU staff members, which in some cases can lead to pensions sanctions, but the extent of those rules is overstated by Mr Pierce.\n\nThe European Commission told us that it would be \u201cprobably impossible\u201d for the people mentioned to lose their pension for criticising the EU or supporting Brexit. We\u2019ve seen multiple cases of both current and ex-commissioners criticising the EU.\n\nWhat rules do EU staff members have to observe?\n\nThe EU told us that current staff have the right to freedom of expression and can express their personal views, which may differ from the official position of the institution, as long as they respect the \u201cprinciples of loyalty and impartiality\u201d.\n\nIn practice, loyalty means not acting in a manner that undermines the Union\u2019s function or norms. Case law also set out that this means \u201crefrain(ing) from conduct detrimental to the dignity and respect due to the institution and its authorities\u201d. The case in question involved an EU official who complained after she was prevented from publishing an article aiming to draw attention to harassment within EU institutions. The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled against the official on the basis that the \u201ctext at issue would seriously prejudice the legitimate interests of the Union\u201d and was \u201cnot substantiated by any evidence to support its claims\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, and especially for more senior officials, they must act in a manner that is beyond suspicion and maintains a relationship of trust between themselves and the institution.\n\nThe European Commission also told us: \u201cIt is extremely rare that pension rights are affected as a result of a sanction. When this happens, it would not be the result of a normal participation in a public debate with political opinions and criticisms based on factual arguments.\n\n\u201cIt would be probably impossible to impose a similar sanction in an area protected by a fundamental right like the freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nSuch obligations are not unique to the EU. For example, British civil servants must \u201cserve the government, whatever its political persuasion, to the best of your ability in a way which maintains political impartiality\u2026 no matter what your own political beliefs are.\u201d\n\nThey must also \u201cact in a way which deserves and retains the confidence of ministers\u201d and \u201call those with whom you have dealings\u201d.\n\nThe rules for ex-officials are slightly different\n\nAndrew Pierce also says that Neil Kinnock, Peter Mandelson and Chris Patten\u2014three ex-politicians now all part of the House of Lords\u2014would all lose their pensions if they criticised the EU.\n\nNone of these men is currently employed by the EU. All three served as European Commissioners, Kinnock from 1995 to 2004, Patten from 2000 to 2004, and Mandelson from 2004 to 2008. The viral Twitter post also refers to Tony Blair, who has never been employed by the EU.\n\nAs the other three are no longer EU employees, they are not subject to the staff regulations, including the duty of loyalty, mentioned above.\n\nHowever there are specific rules for current and former commissioners (like Lords Kinnock, Patten and Mandelson), stating that they could lose their pension rights if they don\u2019t respect \u201ctheir duty to behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance\u2026 of certain appointments or benefits.\u201d\n\nThese are somewhat \u201cvague notions\u201d but effectively set boundaries on potential conflicts of interest\u2014for example prohibiting an ex-commissioner taking a job that involves lobbying the EU on their former policy portfolio for a two year period after leaving post.\n\nThe European Commission told us that a political view expressed by a former Commissioner (such as supporting Brexit) in a public debate would not normally qualify as a breach of obligations, and not lead to them losing their pension.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission told us that former staff must respect the confidentiality of information, and to notify the commission about their professional engagements for a two year period after leaving.\n\nThe fact that former commissioners are, in practice, allowed to criticise the EU can be seen from the fact that several of them have done just that.\n\nFor example, in April 2019, the German former Commissioner G\u00fcnther Verheugen criticised the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiating position, saying \u201cthe problem is on the EU side\u201d. In 2017 the British former Commissioner Lord Hill supported \u201cgetting on\u201d with Brexit, and this month the outgoing President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, criticised his successor Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s decision to create a commissioner for \u201cProtecting the European Way of Life\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
