And they're doing it with an architect, Superintendent (Brenda) Snipes, who has a record of gross incompetence and fraud.\"\n\nWe previously looked at the Broward election supervisor's track record.\n\nHere, we found no evidence to support the claim Democrats and their allies and manufacturing voters.\n\nBy law, a recount was implemented in the too-close-to-call governor\u2019s race between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum, where DeSantis\u2019 winning margin was less than 0.5 percent.\n\nA recount is underway in the Senate race between outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, who trails Scott by less than 0.25 percent. The contest for state agriculture commissioner is also under recount.\n\nBlackwell accused Democrats and their allies of fraud during an appearance on Fox News on Nov. 9, three days after polls closed, but while votes were still being counted.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what Blackwell meant with the term \"manufacturing voters,\" and he did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nAccording to David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a non-profit focused on election integrity, the claim is baseless.\n\n\"There\u2019s zero evidence to support these allegations,\" Becker said. \"It\u2019s unfortunate that some extreme partisans will work so hard to delegitimize our elections process just to win an election.\"\n\nEugene Pettis, an attorney representing Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes in election-related litigation, dismissed Blackwell\u2019s comment as \"political noise.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately it\u2019s not advancing the integrity of our electoral system,\" Pettis said. \"If you have evidence of fraud put it on the table and notify authorities. If not stop the reckless rhetoric.\"\n\nThe Florida Department of State did not respond to our request for comment but it has previously said it has found no evidence of voter fraud or criminal activity. Same goes for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\n\n\"Our staff has seen no evidence of criminal activity at this time,\" Department of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell told PolitiFact.\n\nBlackwell said, \"Democrats and their allies (...) are manufacturing voters.\"\n\nWe found no evidence, nor has the state, to support this claim. Blackwell provided no evidence to support his statement.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
