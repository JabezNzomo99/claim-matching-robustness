Cortes, a frequent Trump surrogate on television, was trying to defend the White House for its refusal to apologize after an aide privately made a morbid joke about Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has an aggressive form of brain cancer. So Cortes responded with a \u201cwhat-about\u201d answer: What about the mainstream media\u2019s refusal to apologize?\n\nThis all started on President Trump\u2019s first day in office, when Zeke Miller, then working for Time magazine (not The Washington Post), was a pool reporter during a media appearance in the Oval Office. A pool reporter takes notes for the rest of the White House press corps at events with controlled access. In this case, Trump signed an executive order to alert federal agencies to be prepared for repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMiller provided color about the redecorated Oval Office and noted that a bust of Winston Churchill was in the office. (As we have explained before, this was a bust that had been in the private residence since 1965, not a bust that President Barack Obama famously returned to the British Embassy.) Miller at first thought that a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. has been moved to make way for the Churchill bust, just as Obama had moved out a Churchill bust to make room for MLK.\n\nMiller reported that the MLK bust had been moved and included that detail in an online article. His observation also was included in a pool report that was issued at 7:31 p.m.: \u201cMore decorating details: Apart from the return of the Churchill bust, the MLK bust was no longer on display.\u201d\n\nMiller then thought better of including unconfirmed information in a pool report and asked a White House aide to double-check on whether the MLK bust was in the Oval Office, according to an editor\u2019s note published by Time magazine on the incident. He got his answer at 8:10 p.m., and so two minutes later emailed a correction to reporters receiving the pool reports: \u201cThe MLK bust remains in the Oval Office in addition to the Churchill bust per a WH aide. It was apparently obscured by a door and an agent earlier. My sincerest apologies.\u201d He also quickly corrected the online article.\n\nNotice the frequent use of the word \u201capology.\u201d In fact, then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer accepted the apology on Twitter just five minutes after Miller issued it. (Note: Since Sarah Huckabee Sanders took over the @PressSec account after Spicer\u2019s resignation, the tweet currently displays her name. But Spicer actually issued the tweet.)\n\nThere are many ways that Cortes got this wrong. It was Time magazine, not The Post, that made the error. But more to the point, within an hour the mistake was corrected and a quick apology was issued. The apology was even accepted by the White House.", "lang": "en"}
