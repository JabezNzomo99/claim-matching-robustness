Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: The 3D-Visualisation shown in the picture is related to \u2018Temple of the Vedic Planetarium\u2019 building at ISKCON Headquarters in Sri Dham Mayapur (West Bengal). Also, when FACTLY contacted Mr Bimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra (one of the members of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust), he clarified that the post is fake. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo of the building was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found on the \u2018ISKCON News\u2019 website. On that website, it can be read that the 3D-Visualisation is related to \u2018Temple of the Vedic Planetarium\u2019 building at ISKCON Headquarters in Sri Dham Mayapur (West Bengal).\n\nA video related to the same 3D-model can be found on the \u2018Temple of the Vedic Planetarium \u2013 TOVP\u2019 YouTube video channel. The latest visualization video of the building has blue domes in place of golden domes. The construction photos of the same building can be seen here, here and here.\n\nAlso, when FACTLY contacted Mr Bimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra (one of the members of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust) regarding the photo, he clarified that the post is fake. Multiple news agencies have recently reported that the Ram Mandir model designed three decades ago by Chandrakant Sompura (with some modifications) will be the design of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir. These news reports can be found here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, the 3D-Visualisation in the post does not show \u2018Architectural view of proposed Ram Mandir\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
