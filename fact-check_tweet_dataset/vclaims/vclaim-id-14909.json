The caption reads, \"Meet the National Investigation Agency (NIA) judge Ravindra Reddy joining BJP who acquitted RSS leader Swamy Aseemanand in Mecca Masjid bomb blast (sic)\".\n\nIndia Today TV's Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be untrue.\n\nSwami Aseemanand, a Hindu religious leader, was accused in the Ajmer Dargah, Mecca Masjid and Samjhauta Express blast cases. NIA judge Ravindra Reddy had acquitted him in the Mecca Masjid blast case last year. More recently, another NIA court acquitted Aseemanand in the Samjhauta Express blast case as well.\n\nNow, a photo is doing the rounds on social media claiming that Reddy has joined the BJP in presence of Amit Shah and Raman Singh. The photo, shared by a Facebook page called 'Mangalore Voice', has been shared more than 1,200 times. The page has a following of more than 4 lakh.\n\nAFWA has found that the photo is misleading. A simple reverse search helped us find the truth behind the photo.\n\nThe man seen in the photo with Amit Shah and Raman Singh is a former Congress leader from Chhattisgarh, Ramdayal Uikey, who joined the BJP last year.\n\nIn April 2018, NIA judge Ravinder Reddy had acquitted all five accused, including Aseemanand, in the Mecca Masjid blast case. Hours after this verdict, Reddy resigned from his post which was later rejected by the high court.\n\nLast year, there were speculations that Reddy was keen to join the BJP, but he didn't do so.\n\nIn fact, in October last year, he joined the Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS), an ally of the Congress in Telangana.\n\nThere have been no media reports till now about Reddy joining BJP. We tried to contact TJS, but haven't received any response till the time of filing this report.\n\nALSO READ | Fact Check: Viral post on Priyanka Gandhi discussing 2022 polls with workers is misleading\n\nALSO READ | Fact Check: No, Urmila Matondkar is not niece of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat", "lang": "en"}
