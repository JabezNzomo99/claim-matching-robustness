(here , here, here).\n\nVarious comments alongside these posts suggest some users understood there to be a link between the two events. One such comment reads: \u201cWhen are they going to learn this BLM is just another extreme organised event protesting because they don\u2019t get what they want so they kill and riot and fight and stab and injure horses!!!\u201d\n\nAnother reads: \u201cMindless idiots r using all these protests to go berserk and now kill innocent ppl! Disgusting.\u201d\n\nWhile it is correct that the attack on Saturday June 20 in Reading occurred in a park that was earlier used as a gathering point for protesters (here), it is false to say the events happened simultaneously, and it is misleading to make the link between them.\n\nThames Valley Police said a number of people were stabbed in Forbury Gardens at around 7pm on Saturday evening, while the protest in the same park had finished three hours earlier.\n\nThe force\u2019s Detective Chief Superintendent Ian Hunter added: \u201cI can confirm that this incident is not connected\u201d (here) .\n\nNieema Hassan, one of the organisers of the earlier demonstration, said in a video \u201cwe had all left\u201d by the time of the attack.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt had nothing to do with the protest. They were very peaceful. We worked with the police liaisons the entire time, and they actually commented on how peaceful and well done and well thought out the protest was today\u201d (here).\n\nPartly false. The protest and the attack happened on the same day and in the same park, but they did not happen simultaneously. The attack happened around three hours after the protest had finished, and police said there was no connection between the protest and the knife attack.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
