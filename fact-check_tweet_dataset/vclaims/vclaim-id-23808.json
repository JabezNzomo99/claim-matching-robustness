{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did Cicero Issue A \u2018Two Thousand Year Old Warning About Trump\u2019?", "subtitle": "", "author": "checkyourfact.com", "date": "2019-05-07T14:03:03.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-23808", "url": "http://checkyourfact.com/2019/05/07/fact-check-cicero-two-thousand-year-old-warning-trump-treason/", "vclaim": "A meme shared on Facebook contains a quote allegedly from the ancient Roman statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero about \u201ctreason from within.\u201d The image claims he made the remark in 42 B.C.\n\nCicero was killed in 43 B.C., one year before he supposedly made this remark. The quote actually originates with the 1965 book \u201cA Pillar of Iron,\u201d where a fictional Cicero says these words.\n\nThe meme calls the quote a \u201ctwo thousand year old warning\u201d about President Donald Trump, who critics have for years accused of colluding with Russia in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe full quote, attributed to Cicero, reads as follows: \u201cA nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. For the traitor appears not a traitor \u2013 He speaks in the accents familiar to his victims, and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation \u2013 he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city \u2013 he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to be feared.\u201d\n\nAfter a search of Cicero\u2019s works, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that he ever said or wrote the statement attributed to him in the meme. The meme also dates the quote to 42 B.C. However, Cicero was assassinated by Roman soldiers in 43 B.C., one year before he supposedly said it.\n\nThe quote actually originates with the 1965 historical novel \u201cA Pillar of Iron\u201d by Taylor Caldwell. The meme leaves out certain phrases from the quote, failing to put ellipses in spots. The excerpt speaks, for example, of how \u201can enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and he carries his banners openly against the city.\u201d\n\nThe book is based on the life and times of Cicero, but even as Caldwell wrote these words in the voice of the statesman, they were made up nonetheless.\n\nExperts on Cicero told TheDCNF that the language used in the passage is reflective of his rhetoric, particularly around the time of the Catilinarian conspiracy in 63 B.C. The conspiracy was a plot orchestrated by aristocrat Lucius Sergius Catilina to overthrow the Roman Republic that was ultimately foiled by Cicero and others.\n\nCicero was a renowned orator and contemporary of Julius Caesar. In the year 63 B.C., he served as one of two consuls, akin to the executive heads of the Roman Republic.\n\nThe historical Cicero warned that it would be threats domestic, not foreign, that posed the greatest danger to the Republic, saying, \u201cFor there is no nation for us to fear,\u2014no king who can make war on the Roman people. All foreign affairs are tranquilized, both by land and sea, by the valor of one man. Domestic war alone remains. The only plots against us are within our own walls,\u2014the danger is within,\u2014the enemy is within. We must war with luxury, with madness, with wickedness. For this war, O citizens, I offer myself as the general. I take on myself the enmity of profligate men.\u201d\n\nDuring his life, Cicero unsuccessfully tried to stave off the fall of the Roman Republic. His work would later inspire influential philosophers like David Hume, John Locke and Montesquieu.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
