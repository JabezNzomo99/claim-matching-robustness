Minor parties and independents have held the balance of power from 1981-2005 and since 2008.\n\nThe second part of the claim states the parties then \u201csigned the Native Forest Protection Act\u201d.\n\nThe Federal Register of Legislation, which lists and tracks all Australian Government legislation and related documents, has no record of a Native Forest Protection Act. A search of the lists of acts that are in force, no longer in force or as made also makes no mention of the bill.\n\nAustralian parliamentary online archives show that a bill called \u201cNative Forest Protection Bill 1996\u201d was introduced to the Senate in 1996 and was read by Mr Brown in the Senate that year.\n\nAn explanatory memorandum tabled with the bill stated the purpose of the proposed law was to provide protection to native forests by prohibiting logging and the exportation of wood chips derived from native forests. But the bill, which was introduced to parliament in 1996, not 2010, did not become law as it was not passed by the parliament. The bill also did not propose cuts to national park rangers or controlled burn programs, which are not the responsibility of the federal government.\n\nThe bill\u2019s author, then newly-elected Tasmanian senator and Australian Greens leader Bob Brown, hoped the bill would \u201cextend a mantle of protection over areas that have been identified by experts as having World Heritage values\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis Bill aims to secure for the future the wonderful forests of this nation, from the South-West wilderness of Tasmania to the karri forests of Western Australia, and from East Gippsland up through the forests of New South Wales to Queensland,\u201d Mr Brown told the Senate in September 1996.\n\nThe photo used in the Facebook post is a September 1, 2010 image of Ms Gillard and Mr Brown signing an agreement that formalised the Greens' support for a minority Labor government. Labor did not secure the support of independents Oakeshott and Windsor, allowing it to form minority government, until September 7.\n\nThe agreement was the formal deal that aligned the parties objectives in the lead up to the forming of government in 2010.", "lang": "en"}
