Katherine Rogers reportedly said that \u201cit\u2019s always time to revisit and to look at our Constitution,\u201d after former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a New York Times op-ed that called for repealing the Second Amendment. Rogers, however, didn\u2019t go that far herself.\n\n\u201cSo I think having this discussion is good, and maybe the op-ed by Justice Stevens leads to a lot of interesting discussion,\u201d she said, according to the New Hampshire Journal. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to say let\u2019s get rid of the Second Amendment, but I think it\u2019s an interesting discussion for everybody to have.\u201d\n\nThat same month, Louisiana state Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, who is also the chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party and the vice chair of civic engagement and voter participation for the Democratic National Committee, wrote \u201cRepeal the Second Amendment\u201d in a since-deleted tweet in which she shared a link to Stevens\u2019 opinion piece. But Louisiana Democratic Party Executive Director Stephen Handwerk later told the USA Today Network that Peterson told him that wasn\u2019t her position.\n\nMore recently, in August, Sen. Ed Markey\u2019s Democratic primary challenger in Massachusetts, Shannon Liss-Riordan, said she does believe repeal is necessary.\n\n\u201cI agree with the late Justice John Paul Stevens: the Second Amendment is \u2018a relic of the 18th century.\u2019 We need leaders in Washington who understand that, and have the courage and the will to fight to repeal the Second Amendment,\u201d she reportedly said in a statement.\n\nIn addition, about 39 percent of Democrats support repealing the Second Amendment, according to a February 2018 Economist/YouGov poll, and about 33 percent of Democrats support it, according to an April 2018 Quinnipiac University survey.\n\nBut an official proposal to amend the Constitution can only be made in a convention called for by two-thirds of U.S. states, or it has to be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate. And last year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told the New York Times, \u201cIt is unequivocally not the Democratic caucus\u2019 position to repeal the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nDemocrats running to challenge Trump for the presidency in 2020 haven\u2019t proposed doing that, either. Several candidates have unveiled plans to address gun violence that include a ban on so-called \u201cassault weapons,\u201d but not all guns.\n\nOn Sept. 1, the day before some of the Facebook ads reappeared, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas reiterated in a CNN interview his support for an \u201cassault weapons ban\u201d and a mandatory national buyback program for certain semi-automatic weapons, which he called \u201cweapons of war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not right, and we should not accept it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we should be honest with ourselves. Universal background checks will help. Ending the sales of weapons of war will help. But if millions of them remain on the streets, they will still be instruments of terror that terrify and terrorize us and take our lives. And I\u2019m not going to accept that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need an AR-15, an AK-47 \u2026 a weapon of war designed to kill people as efficiently, as effectively, in as great a number as possible,\u201d he later added. \u201cLet\u2019s not sell those anymore, and let\u2019s bring them back off of our streets.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden also said in a CNN interview last month that he would implement a federal gun buyback program for assault weapons. That was days after fatal mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 3 and Aug. 4.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period. Look, the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t say you can\u2019t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own,\u201d Biden argued. \u201cWhat I would do is I would try to \u2014 I would institute a national buyback program and I would move in the direction of making sure that that, in fact, was what we tried to do, get them off the street.\u201d\n\nBiden said guns that had been legally purchased would not be confiscated.\n\nSo, some individual Democrats may support an effort to repeal the Second Amendment, but that\u2019s not currently being pursued by Democrats in Congress or those running for president. That distinction may not be clear to Facebook users who encountered the ads imploring them to sign up to protect that part of the Constitution.", "lang": "en"}
