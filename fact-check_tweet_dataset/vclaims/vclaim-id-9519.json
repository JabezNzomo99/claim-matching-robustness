Some drugs may have price disparities that high, but experts say the overall difference from other countries isn\u2019t that large.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about the cost of prescription drugs relative to other countries came during a cabinet meeting on Oct. 16.\n\nTrump, Oct. 16: The other thing we\u2019re doing that relates to people\u2019s lives is the prescription drug prices are out of control. The drug prices have gone through the roof. And if you look at the same exact drug by the same exact company, made in the same exact box and sold someplace else, sometimes it\u2019s a fraction of what we pay in this country \u2014 meaning, as usual, the world is taking advantage of the United States. They\u2019re setting prices in other countries and we\u2019re not. The drug companies, frankly, are getting away with murder, and we want to bring our prices down to what other countries are paying, or at least close and let the other countries pay more. Because they\u2019re setting such low prices that we\u2019re actually subsidizing other countries, and that\u2019s just not going to happen anymore. This has been going on for years where our people are paying so much more for it. And I don\u2019t mean they\u2019re paying 2 percent more; I mean they\u2019re paying double, triple, quadruple. They\u2019re paying so much more that it\u2019s very unfair to the United States, as usual.\n\nPrescription drug experts say it is broadly accurate that branded prescription drug prices are higher in the U.S. than other countries, though they say Trump is stretching, or cherry-picking, when he says prices are \u201cdouble, triple, quadruple\u201d what people pay in other countries.\n\n\u201cThere are instances in which a drug in the U.S. is 4 times the amount it is in, say, Germany. But, on average the branded drug prices in the U.S. and Germany are not nearly that different,\u201d said Joshua P. Cohen, an independent health care consultant formerly of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that on average, across all branded products, branded prices are currently between 10 percent and 40 percent more expensive in the U.S. than similarly industrialized [countries] internationally,\u201d Cohen said, based on several studies he has done over the years.\n\nExperts in drug pricing warn that comparisons between countries are inherently complicated, in part because of proprietary discounts offered by pharmaceutical companies to various buyers.\n\nA 2013 study published by Health Affairs found that prices for a selection of brand-name drugs were 5 percent to 117 percent higher in the U.S. compared with six other countries in the study. Another analysis by Bloomberg in 2015 looked at eight top-selling branded drugs and found that, even with discounts, those drugs were being sold in the U.S. for significantly higher prices \u2014 in some cases double or even triple the rate in other industrialized countries.\n\nWe should also note that these comparisons are for prices of branded drugs. That does not account for cheaper generic drugs, which account for about 84 percent of filled prescriptions in the U.S. Generic drugs tend to be cheaper in the U.S. than in other countries, Cohen said, and so a proper comparison would include both branded and generic drugs.\n\nNonetheless, there is broad consensus that branded drugs cost more in the U.S.\n\nTrump says this means, \u201cas usual, the world is taking advantage of the United States.\u201d But experts say the U.S. is responsible for the high cost of drug prices, not other countries.\n\n\u201cIt is more the drug companies that are taking advantage of the U.S.\u201d Glen T. Schumock, director of the Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told us via email. \u201cWe allow the drug companies to do this by not regulating drug prices. Other counties are just doing what makes sense, and what we should do. The drug companies will claim that they need the high prices in the U.S. to pay for new drug development. But most of the profit is not invested in R&D, and recent evidence shows that the cost to develop a new drug is actually much lower than they claim.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., elected officials \u2014 mostly Republicans \u2014 have been reluctant to enact regulations to control drug prices, Schumock said. \u201cThe argument is that price controls will prevent innovation and new drug development.\u201d\n\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, passed in 2003 largely with Republican votes, specifically prohibited Medicare from negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThat\u2019s not how it works in other countries. Most other developed countries have a centralized health care system that allows the government to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\u201cThe government of those countries tells the drug company what the price will be,\u201d Schumock said. \u201cIf the company doesn\u2019t like it their only choice is to not sell it there. Most of the time they sell it at that price because they are still making money even with the low price. They certainly wouldn\u2019t sell the drug if they were losing money.\u201d\n\nOr, as Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, wrote to us in an email, \u201cFirms are never required to sell a product in to any country, so what France pays is a decision between the firm and France, it has no relation to what we pay. Put another way, the firm will seek to maximize in France regardless.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s argument \u201cwould suggest that firms would lower their prices in France (as an example) if we paid more here,\u201d Bach said. \u201cThere is no economic reason for this to happen. Rather, companies clearly find it long term profitable to sell at the prices they do sell at in Western countries.\u201d\n\nBach also takes issue with the president\u2019s characterization that \u201cthey\u2019re setting prices in other countries and we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrice setting conceptually only applies when there is truly a monopsonistic buyer that has complete control over the potential market for the seller,\u201d Bach said. \u201cWhat actually happens, and this varies somewhat by country but still, is that the country exercises some market power and a lot of discretion, being willing to say \u2018No\u2019 to products due to a disconnect between their price and their benefit. There are many versions of how they do this, but the core principle is that they are willing to say, \u2018No.'\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that the U.S. is \u201csubsidizing\u201d the cost in other countries suggests that Americans are paying too much to make up for losses in other countries, Bach said. \u201cThat is wrong in all likelihood because firms would simply choose not to sell at a loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore important,\u201d Bach said, \u201cit is often said we subsidize the industry by paying for their R&D [research and development].\u201d\n\nBut research he co-authored earlier this year found that drug companies spent much less on R&D than steeper prices in the U.S. could potentially fund. \u201cThe premiums pharmaceutical companies earn from charging substantially higher prices for their medications in the US compared to other Western countries generates substantially more than the companies spend globally on their research and development,\u201d Bach\u2019s study said. Specifically it concluded that the extra amount paid for drugs by U.S. consumers paid for 1.7 times the worldwide R&D expenses.\n\nSchumock said that while it may not be correct to say the U.S. subsidizes other countries, \u201cwe do pay for a lot of research\u201d via the National Institutes of Health and other agencies \u201cthat leads to new drug innovations that ultimately benefits patients throughout the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne reason U.S. prescription drug prices are higher may be the relative lack of price control strategies,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cUnlike the U.S., many other countries employ centralized price negotiations, national formularies, and comparative and cost-effectiveness research for determining price ceilings. In the U.S., health care delivery and payment are fragmented, with numerous, separate negotiations between drug manufacturers and payers and complex arrangements for various federal and state health programs. And, in general, the U.S. allows wider latitude for monopoly pricing of brand-name drugs than other countries are willing to accept.\u201d\n\nTrump said that \u201cwe want to bring our prices down to what other countries are paying.\u201d But he did not say what measures he was supporting, and whether they would include, for example, allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices or allowing the purchase of drugs from other countries like Canada \u2014 ideas that have generally been promoted by Democrats.\n\nWe reached out to the White House press office for clarification on what exactly Trump is proposing, but we did not hear back.\n\nDuring the primary campaign, Trump twice said during Republican debates that pharmaceutical companies \u201care not mandated to bid properly.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference after his election victory (but before his inauguration), Trump reiterated his call for Medicare to negotiate drug prices.\n\n\u201cThe other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry, because they\u2019re getting away with murder,\u201d Trump said in early January. \u201cWe\u2019re the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet we don\u2019t bid properly and we\u2019re going to start bidding and save billions of dollars over a period of time.\u201d\n\nReporting on his comments, the Hill noted that the \u201cissue could create a divide with congressional Republicans, who, with some exceptions, oppose the idea.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments caught the attention of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination. Sanders said Trump was right and suggested Trump may have even gotten the idea from him.\n\n\u201cHe means \u2018negotiating,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s up for negotiating, of course we have to do that. The VA does that and their prices are lower than for Medicare and other government agencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is whether Trump and his Republican colleagues have the guts to take on one of the most powerful industries in America,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna be done, of course.\u201d\n\nThat Trump again appears to be open to price controls in the U.S. is \u201cremarkable,\u201d Cohen, the health care consultant, told us.\n\n\u201cI assume that by setting prices the president is referring to price controls,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThat would go against U.S. policy on drug pricing, which has left it mostly to market forces.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
