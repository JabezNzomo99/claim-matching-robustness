She retired as SPEAKER at $223,500 a year.\n\nPLUS she will receive an additional $193,400 a year as Minority Leader. That's $803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical which is not available to us ... .\n\nShe is just one of the hundreds of Senators and Congress that float in and out every year!\n\nI think we found where the cuts should be made!\n\nIf you agree ..... pass it on, I just did.\n\nIn honor of Congress\u2019 , let\u2019s keep this simple: Do congressional lawmakers earn their salaries \"FOR LIFE? Would House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi get \"$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical\"?\n\nNo. And really, really, really, no.\n\nDo congressional lawmakers earn their salaries \"FOR LIFE?\n\nLet\u2019s turn to the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the Congressional Research Service, which explains laws so even lawmakers can understand them.\n\u2022 Members of Congress earn their $174,000 salaries only . (Nope, not for life.)\n\u2022 They\u2019re eligible for congressional pensions only after . (For a member of the House, that would mean getting elected to office at least three times .)\n\nThose pensions can\u2019t be tapped until retirement age \u2014 and can\u2019t be collected while a lawmaker still gets a federal salary. So John Kerry, for example, can\u2019t collect his congressional pension while he serves as secretary of state, according to Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union.\n\u2022 The size of the pension and the average of a lawmaker\u2019s highest three years of salary. The exact formula on when they started. Meanwhile, every paycheck, lawmakers contribute to both their pensions and Social Security.\n\u2022 Most congressional pensions are a lawmaker\u2019s salary. Under a pre-1984 retirement formula, it couldn\u2019t be more than of a lawmaker\u2019s final salary, not counting cost-of-living adjustments. Under current rules, lawmakers could theoretically get more than 80 percent of their salary, but most would need to serve more than 66 years to get that.\n\nWould House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi get \"$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical\"?\n\nThe email writer gets a whole host of things wrong here.\n\nThe message claims Pelosi will retire as a member of Congress making $174,000 \u2014 and that she\u2019ll earn it annually, for life, on top of her full speaker\u2019s salary of $223,500 and minority leader\u2019s salary of $193,400, for a whopping \"$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical.\"\n\nCongressional leaders do than other lawmakers. The speaker of the House earns $223,500. The House minority leader earns $193,400. That\u2019s more than the $174,000 earned by the rank and file. But those are annual salaries that leaders earn while they hold their titles, not lifetime guarantees that get stacked on top of one another.\n\u2022 First, even if her pension did equal all three salaries, they add up to $590,900, not $803,700. (Unless perhaps the writer\u2019s suggesting the \"free medical\" is worth $212,800 a year. Talk about rising health care costs!)\n\u2022 Second, that\u2019s not how it works. See above.\n\u2022 Third, lawmakers .\" They pay a portion of their health insurance premiums, co-pays and co-insurance and can face a deductible, just like a lot of workers with employer-based health care. In January, their will be a choice of plans offered on Obamacare\u2019s federal exchange.\n\nPelosi\u2019s higher salary as House speaker from 2007-11 will boost her pension. But the congresswoman, who\u2019s been in office since 1987, would have to work at least two more decades for her starting pension to match a regular lawmaker\u2019s pay, much less $803,700.\n\nAnd, oh, by the way, lawmakers since January 2009.\n\nWe\u2019re not saying they\u2019re earning their keep.\n\nBut perhaps it\u2019ll make you feel slightly better that their salaries this year hit their . And that more than 200 of them were while the government was closed.\n\nA viral message claims congressional lawmakers earn their salaries \"FOR LIFE,\" which for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would add up to \"$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical.\"\n\nLawmakers don\u2019t earn a salary after their terms end. They may earn pensions based on years of service, but those don\u2019t start until retirement. They don\u2019t get \"free medical.\"\n\nIt might feel good to click Forward. But it wouldn\u2019t make this claim any less Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
