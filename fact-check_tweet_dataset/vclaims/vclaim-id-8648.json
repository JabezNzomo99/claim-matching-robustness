Duterte's Persistent Visit to Benguet Despite Security Issues Not Reported by Mainstream Media.\"\n\nThe false story also claims that the \"dangers\" Duterte allegedly faced to reach Benguet went unreported, including a supposedly risky helicopter ride, \"wet and slippery\" roads, and the \"possible threat of an NPA [New People's Army] ambush.\"\n\nThese claims , which philnews.xyz merely sourced from a netizen's Facebook post, are unsubstantiated.\n\nThe media covered Duterte's visit to Benguet, where he met with the bereaved families of the victims of the massive landslide in Ucab, Itogon town and offered them financial assistance. He also got a briefing from local officials about the damage and casualties of Ompong, the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year.\n\nPhilnews.xyz's false story could have reached over 75,000 people. Social media traffic largely came from the unofficial Facebook page of Agriculture Secretary Manny Pi\u00f1ol, and Unofficial: Sec. Martin Andanar.", "lang": "en"}
