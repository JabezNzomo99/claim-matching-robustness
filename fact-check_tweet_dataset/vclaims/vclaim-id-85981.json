How kosher is this? Binder, in 2002, co-wrote a paper that concluded there was 94 percent correlation between cloture motions and documented filibusters between 1917 and 1996. But the CRS report, using newer data, warns that \u201cit would be erroneous, however, to treat this table as a list of filibusters on nominations.\u201d So at the very least, Reid\u2019s office ignored this admonition. (For the record, Binder says that \u201cI think it is thoroughly fair to say that the increase in cloture motions and votes reflects a real increase in minority obstruction.\u201d)\n\nA larger question is what this graphic is supposed to document. According to the CRS data, only 29 nominees (12 during the Obama presidency and 14 during the George W. Bush presidency) did not receive a final vote or had their nomination withdrawn. In other words, eventually most of the nominees were approved, either by voice vote or with overwhelming support. Yet the graphic says the nominees were \u201cblocked\u201d and Reid in his floor speech said \u201cthese nominees deserve at least an up-or-down vote.\u201d\n\nAdam Jentleson, Reid\u2019s communication director, says that \u201cblock\u201d does not mean that a nomination is fully derailed, but that the minority used delaying tactics that ate up valuable floor time. Reid\u2019s reference to a \u201cfair vote\u201d meant that the minority would not agree to simply proceed to a vote on the nomination without first requiring the Senate to go through the cumbersome cloture process. (Before the Senate began to split along partisan lines, setting up votes by unanimous consent was standard practice.)\n\n\u201cWhen Senator Reid files cloture it is because Republicans are blocking the nominee from receiving a fair up-or-down vote, and he has determined that the only way to get that vote is to file cloture, and waste the better part of a week,\u201d Jentleson said. \u201cOur whole point in the larger debate here is that it should not become accepted procedure that nominees \u2014 even consensus nominees \u2014 require almost a week of floor time before they can get a vote.\u201d\n\nJentleson supplied another CRS report, not made public before, that documented the number of days it took the Senate in the 112th Congress to work its way through cloture votes on legislation. On average, the Senate spent four days per cloture motion on bills between the time the motion was filed and the time dispositive action was taken. Given that 43 bills were subject to cloture, in theory one could calculate that 190 days were spent burning the cloture clock, but the Senate also is able to conduct other business in this period. The report is embedded below.\n\nWe should note that, no matter who is in the White House, the opposing party often figures out ways to create delays in the Senate. Republicans controlled the Senate during much of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, so nominees were easily derailed simply by refusing to hold a hearing. While Obama\u2019s judicial nominees have often waited a long time for a vote after committee approval, we have earlier documented how George W. Bush\u2019s nominees were slow-walked by Democrats before the committee hearing. Bush\u2019s appeals court nominees, in fact, took four times as long to get a hearing as Obama\u2019s nominees.\n\nThe minority can still refuse to grant unanimous consent to proceed to a vote, and so the majority leader may feel pressure to file for cloture, with all of its attendant delays. The only difference is that a vote on the nomination could proceed with just 50 votes, rather than 60. So the supermajority filibuster may be gone, but the delays that so anger Democrats may continue.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t count a simple majority cloture motion as a filibuster,\u201d Binder said. \u201cOn the other elements of the cloture rule though, it\u2019s hard to distinguish between following the rules and plain old obstruction. Take the 30 hours of post-cloture debate for appellate nominees, even under the new post-nuclear regime. The leader sometimes asks for unanimous consent to waive the 30 hours of post-cloture debate. Would that count as obstruction if the minority refuses to consent? Tough call. If the minority refused to consent just to slow down a confirmation vote to keep a judge off the bench, that seems like obstruction to me. But of course it\u2019s hard to discern senators\u2019 motives from their actions.\u201d\n\nBut we especially find it hard to get past CRS\u2019s admonition that the data in its report should not be used to calculate the number of filibusters, as Reid\u2019s office has done. If the concern is really about delays and obstruction, then a more transparent and easily understood metric should be developed. We lean slightly toward Two Pinocchios, given that the source of the report warns against the very math that is used in the graphic.", "lang": "en"}
