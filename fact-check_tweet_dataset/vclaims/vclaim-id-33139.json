The original image, which predates President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign by several years, does not.\n\nFacebook users are sharing an altered image to take aim at President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection and encouraging others to \u201cvote Blue in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe image, part of a meme that was shared most recently by a page called \u201cTrump Sucks,\u201d falsely depicts members of the Ku Klux Klan carrying a Trump-Pence sign.\n\n\u201cAmerica, I believe this is all you need to know about why you should vote Blue in 2020,\u201d the meme reads.\n\nA reverse image search led us to news reports using the unedited image and crediting Getty Images. We then found the original through Getty.\n\nThe actual photo was taken in July 2009 \u2014 long before Trump even launched his 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 at a march in Pulaski, Tennessee, recognizing the birthday of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general who became the first grand wizard of the original KKK.\n\nThe actual sign being carried in the picture reads, \u201cFraternal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, former KKK leader David Duke announced his support for Trump. After initially claiming that he didn\u2019t know Duke, Trump later said, \u201cI disavow\u201d the endorsement.\n\nTrump was also criticized by some for his remarks following a 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, during which a neo-Nazi plowed his car into protesters demonstrating against the white nationalists and killed one woman, Heather Heyer.\n\nWhile some of Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 including that there was \u201chatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\u201d \u2014 drew criticism, the president later explicitly condemned \u201cthe KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\u201d\n\nAt least one other altered version of the same image was edited to depict the klansmen carrying signs in favor of the anti-fascist activist group Antifa.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
