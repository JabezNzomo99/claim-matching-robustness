No, that's not true. The president of Black Lives Matter Arizona told Lead Stories that a meme making the claim on social media is false, and that the Arizona group is separate from the more-established Black Lives Matter Global Network.\n\nThe claim appears as a meme (archived here) where it was published on Instagram on August 19, 2020. The meme read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on the page of at the time of this writing:\n\nThere are three problems with this meme. First, there was no such post -- or any -- on the official @blacklivesmatterarizona Instagram page before the account was deactivated August 19, 2020, and despite the person posting the meme writing:\n\nAnd the head of the Arizona Black Lives Matter group told Lead Stories, \"It's not true,\" when sent the Instagram meme.\n\nBlack Lives Matter Arizona President Katt McKinney, whose group's name is All Black Lives Matter on Facebook, told us that the official BLM, which started as a hashtag in 2013 after the aquital of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin in Florida and is now the Black Lives Matter Global Network, stopped accepting new chapters. McKinney and other Arizona activists formed their own group in Arizona in 2014 to protest police brutality and killings.\n\n\"We fly the same Black Lives Matter flag,\" said McKinney, explaining they have a similar agenda but are separate from the international BLM network.\n\nSo, while their mission is similar, Black Lives Matter Arizona is not an official chapter of the Black Lives Matter global organization, as shown here:\n\nLead Stories reached out to the official Black Lives Matter global organization, and this story will be updated when a response is received.\n\nThe money-soliciting meme is completely made up.", "lang": "en"}
