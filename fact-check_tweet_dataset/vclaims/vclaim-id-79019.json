We\u2019re No. 3!\"\n\nBut that\u2019s what we heard from Libertarians in the purple state of Florida.\n\nWe spotted a claim about the numbers and growth of libertarians in an announcement about a Libertarian event in Broward County:\n\n\"The Libertarian Party is the third-largest organized political party in the United States and has seen tremendous growth over the last two years as many Democrats and Republicans have become disenchanted with their respective parties.\" (The article was written by Karl Dickey who serves on the Libertarian Party of Florida\u2019s executive committee and represents Broward, Palm Beach and Hendry counties.) We found a similar claim on the Libertarian Party of Broward website that the party is \"the third-largest political party in the U.S.\"\n\nWe wanted to explore the numbers and the power of the Libertarian Party. Is it the third-largest party in the country?\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at the numbers of Libertarians in the past. But as Sen. Rand Paul -- a Kentucky Republican with a libertarian outlook -- makes headlines as a potential 2016 presidential contender, it seemed like a good time to revisit the numbers.\n\nLibertarian activists and political scientists we contacted suggested the same source: Richard Winger, a Libertarian in California and editor of a monthly newsletter, Ballot Access News, which includes data on party registration that Winger researches.\n\nHis December issue showed there were 325,807 registered Libertarians nationwide. (About half the states tally Libertarians, Winger\u2019s data shows.)\n\nThe number of registered Libertarians was higher than other national third parties including the Green, Constitution or Reform parties.\n\nBut with Democrats\u2019 registration at 43.5 million and Republicans at 41.3 million according to Winger\u2019s data, that puts any third-place finisher trailing way behind.\n\nAlso, the number of Libertarians was substantially lower than two catch-all categories which Winger calls \"indp. misc\" at 26.8 million and \"other\" at 2.9 million.\n\nThe miscellaneous category includes states that have a miscellaneous category, as well as voters who write in answers (such as \"birthday party\") on their registration. Winger\u2019s \"other\" includes a combination of actual parties.\n\nSince those catch-all categories were large, we picked a couple of states to look in more detail at third-party registrations.\n\nIn California, there were 477,129 registered with the American Independent Party. In New York, there were 430,072 registered with the Independence Party as of November 2012.\n\nBut Winger said those groups in California and New York aren\u2019t \"nationally organized parties. Those are one-state parties.\" That\u2019s why when Winger talks about Libertarians\u2019 voter registration he includes the phrase \"nationally organized\" -- something the Libertarians in Broward omitted.\n\nWe\u2019re not suggesting that those state parties in California or New York are powerful players nationwide -- or even in their own states. Some New York voters wrongly think they are registering as independents, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nMarkham Robinson, a leader with the American Independent Party, told PolitiFact in an interview that he did a survey of AIP voters and of the 200 who responded, one-third didn\u2019t realize they had registered with a party.\n\nStill, Robinson said he\u2019d give that third ranking to his own group based on voter registration.\n\nRobinson suggested another way to measure third-party influence: a group\u2019s registration as a percentage of total voters. By that method, he gave a shout-out to the Independent American Party in Nevada -- they garnered almost 5 percent of the state\u2019s registration as of October.\n\nLibertarians do have a point when they say they are growing. Ballot Access News showed in 2008 there were 240,328 Libertarians, compared with 325,807 in 2012, an increase of about 36 percent.\n\nBut their power lies not in electing Libertarians but more in the libertarian philosophy making inroads with the GOP. And some experts told us to examine votes received or the number of candidates who ran as signs of party strength rather than just voter registration.\n\nIn 2012, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson received about 1.3 million votes -- more than any other third-party candidate. Johnson's tally, amounting to about 1 percent, is the largest for a non-major-party candidate since Ralph Nader's Green race in 2000, said J. David Gillespie, author of a book on third parties.\n\n\"Libertarians always run far more people for congressional and state legislative seats across the nation than do the Greens, Constitution Party, or any other third party,\" he said.\n\nSome libertarians choose not to register with the Libertarian Party, either because they don\u2019t like party labels or so they can participate in the nominating contests held by the major parties.\n\nLibertarians \"do have influence beyond their size, because libertarian ideas appeal to people on both left and right,\" said Shaun Bowler, a political science professor at the University of California.\n\nThe Libertarian Party in Broward said on its website that the Libertarian Party \"is the third-largest political party in the U.S.\"\n\nQuantifying the number of Libertarians is tricky; some states don\u2019t track the affiliation. As for those officially registered with the Libertarian Party, it\u2019s about 326,000. Some state-based parties -- most notably the Independence Party in New York and the American Independent Party in California -- have more people registered to their party than that, though.", "lang": "en"}
