And as new environmental regulations tend to be received, industry groups believed it would add costs to operators and environmental groups believed the rules didn\u2019t go far enough. Readers asked us to check this $97,000 figure, as it was quoted in almost every news article that day and continues to be cited.\n\nThe Interior Department released its final rules on fracking on March 20, 2015, after four years of heated debate. The regulations imposed stronger standards for companies practicing fracking on federal and tribal lands. This was the first time since the 1980s that the agency moved to standardize fracking regulations on federal land. About 90 percent of wells currently drilled on federal land use fracking. Less than a quarter of the country\u2019s fossil-fuel output comes from federal lands.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management estimates the rule will affect between 2,800 to 3,800 wells per year, based on how active operations are on public lands in a given year. The agency estimates costs of complying with the new rule could be about $11,400 to $11,800 per operation, or $32 million to $45 million a year. This would make up about 0.13 to 0.21 percent of the cost of drilling a well, according to the final rule.\n\nWEA\u2019s analysts say the rule requires an additional 2,350 feet of casing per well, which they called a conservative estimate. Operators had been following the BLM\u2019s Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2, which was written in 1988. The order is written broadly, and allows companies to work with states to comply with construction requirements that are safe and cost-effective, since each basin is geologically unique. Currently, state regulators set the minimum well depth, construction requirements, cement casing at which fracturing is safe and practical, according to a fact sheet on fracking by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Cement casings are built to last at least 40 years, and operators and states already work closely to isolate usable water and not contaminate natural gas, according to the fact sheet.\n\nThe federal rule newly requires companies to \u201cdetermine and document that there is adequate cement for all casing strings to isolate usable water.\u201d Sgamma said this takes away flexibility and companies will need to add cement to meet federal requirements. Sgamma acknowledged that some wells may not need to add any extra casing, while other wells may need a lot more than 2,350 feet. She said the final cost for operators may be even bigger than $97,000 per well, because figure does not include new changes that were added in the final rule. WEA is studying the impact for the next few months.\n\n\u201cRegulators often don\u2019t have an appreciation for how requirements translate practically on the ground, or how wording can be interpreted in various ways. Certainly the Washington BLM office doesn\u2019t understand how the BLM field offices had worked with states to identify the usable water zones that they actually cared about \u2026 and had flexibility on how to protect them, whereas now, this rule is very prescriptive,\u201d Sgamma said.\n\nThe BLM costs are so low because they believe the new rule incorporates industry practices, and formalizes what operators already are doing. Officials estimate wells largely are complying with these casing requirements, so they would not have to build large amounts of new casing. So BLM estimates that if there are, in fact, new costs associated with the casing standard, it would be for logging and reporting purposes.\n\nMichael Scialla, an oil and gas analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., who follows oil and gas companies that are drilling and fracking wells and advises investors, said his clients have not expressed major cost concerns. Not all the companies he follows practice fracking on federal land, but those that do have said the impact would be minimal. The companies are concerned that formalized federal regulations would take away flexibility that companies have to work with state regulators, he said. But they are in compliance with \u201cvirtually everything\u201d that is required in the new rules, Scialla said.\n\nHowever, we wonder about the BLM\u2019s estimates, which the government believes is an overestimate. Officials attributed their numbers to the agency\u2019s economists, who wrote the proposed rule\u2019s economic analysis. BLM assumes the industry already is complying with the majority of requirements, but acknowledges it \u201cdoes not have specific data about the prevalence of voluntary compliance with these requirements irrespective of the rule.\u201d So it could vastly decrease or increase costs for operators, depending on their current practices.\n\nThe exact impact of the rule remains to be seen, and there are pending legal challenges to the BLM rule. While it makes sense that industry groups are bracing for high cost impacts, it is difficult to believe that the BLM\u2019s casing requirements, modeled after industry standards, would be so detrimental to companies. Long-lasting construction projects such as cement casings are built carefully with state regulators, keeping in mind the individual geological characteristics of the basins. One would presume that industry standards and state regulations have been more stringent than federal requirements set in 1988.\n\nYet the BLM estimates that cement casing requirements would be as little as $4,000 per well is fishy. It assumes that majority of wells already are complying with the new federal rules, yet those requirements have been determined by state regulators so far. We are hindered by the lack of a breakdown of wells that already meet federal requirement, but the BLM\u2019s estimate may end up being too low. The BLM acknowledges it does not have accurate data on companies that are voluntarily complying with the new requirements.\n\nThese two figures are so extreme that it is difficult to conclude which one is a more realistic one. Each figure is used by proponents and opponents of the BLM rule as a definitive calculation of its impact. But in reality, it is so much more complicated than that. These numbers obscure the complexities of this debate, and the fact that neither the BLM nor the industry groups really know how many wells will be affected.
