But does she pal around with Nazis?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2020-05-22T07:00:33.873Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86355", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/22/dark-money-group-smears-valerie-plame-with-white-supremacist-label/", "vclaim": "Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D) is running for Senate, opening up a strongly Democratic district. One of the top contenders in the June 2 primary is Plame, a former CIA operative who gained fame after her name was revealed to reporters during the controversy over the George W. Bush administration\u2019s claims about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. As readers may recall, in 2019 we slapped Plame with Three Pinocchios when her initial campaign ad overstated the case against one administration official.\n\nIt all started when Plame tweeted out a link to an article posted on the Unz Review, a website that says it provides a forum for \u201calternative perspectives,\u201d which happens to include anti-Semitic diatribes. The article, by Philip Giraldi, was titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Jews Are Driving America\u2019s Wars\u201d and the tweet showed a photo of commentator Bill Kristol. The article listed Jews it called \u201cconduits for the false information that led to a war [with Iraq] that has spread and effectively destroyed much of the Middle East.\u201d It also asserted that \u201cJewish groups and deep pocket individual donors not only control the politicians, they own and run the media and entertainment industries\" and suggested Jewish commentators should be identified as Jewish when they appear on television, akin to \u201ca warning label on a bottle of rat poison.\u201d\n\nEventually, at some point during the day, Plame apparently read the whole article herself. \u201cOK folks, look, I messed up. I skimmed this piece, zeroed in on the neocon criticism, and shared it without seeing and considering the rest,\u201d she tweeted about an article she had previously called \u201cthoughtful.\u201d She added: \u201cApologies all. There is so much there that\u2019s problematic AF and I should have recognized it sooner.\u201d\n\nWell, just about everyone has bad days on Twitter, but this was an especially spectacular flameout. It didn\u2019t help that Twitter users found a few earlier examples of Plame tweeting other articles by Giraldi that had appeared in the Unz Review in 2014 and 2015. One article touted a 9/11 conspiracy theory about \u201cdancing Israelis\u201d \u2014 Mossad agents who supposedly had prior knowledge of the attacks on the World Trade Center. In 2017, Plame also suggested that then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer should apologize to \u201cother rich Jews\u201d besides Sheldon Adelson.\n\nSugar said the use of the phrase \u201cwhite supremacists friends\u201d is justified because Plame has accepted \u2014 and not returned \u2014 campaign donations from a former GOP member of Congress, Pete McCloskey Jr., who won fame in 1972 for challenging President Richard M. Nixon for the Republican nomination on an antiwar platform. McCloskey supposedly referenced the \u201cso-called Holocaust\u201d and said \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re right or wrong about the Holocaust\u201d during a May 2000 speech to the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), a now-much-diminished group that promotes Holocaust denial, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nUpdate: There is a video of the McCloskey speech that was posted on YouTube in 2019. \u201cI came because I respect the thesis of this organization \u2013 the thesis being that there should be a reexamination of whatever governments say or politicians say or political entities say. I was in politics for fifteen years, and I think you should start with the assumption: never trust a politician,\u201d McCloskey says, noting: \u201cEarlier here today I listened to speeches about the courage of men in France, Britain, Germany, and New Zealand who have spoken out against the commonly accepted concept of what occurred during the Second World War in the so-called Holocaust.\u201d Much of the speech, titled \u201cMachinations of the Anti-Defamation League,\u201d is actually an attack on the ADL. There is no booing.\n\nHeather Colburn, a spokesman for the Plame campaign, did not respond directly to a question about McCloskey\u2019s donations. \u201cThis campaign is funded by people who want someone in Congress who will stand up and fight for access to quality health care and an economy that works for everyone. These attacks are the work of people who are desperate to elect their candidate and who will do whatever it takes to win,\" she said. \"They will continue to perpetuate these extreme and disgusting attacks because it is all they have. New Mexicans should stand up and speak out about these groups, their hate speech and the candidates they support.\u201d\n\nPlame certainly demonstrated terrible judgment in tweeting an article with anti-Semitic language, especially if, as she claims, she did not fully read the article. She briefly defended herself, but then within hours, she apologized. She also had tweeted a few other articles from a clearly anti-Semitic website. One could imagine an ad crafted around these events that asks New Mexicans whether they want a member of Congress who is so sloppy about her sources of information.\n\nBut instead, this ad uses lurid images and words to smear Plame as a white supremacist \u2014 or at least claim she is willing to represent them in Congress. There is no evidence that is the case, especially given her quick effort to disassociate herself from her tweets and her strong language condemning white supremacism. We swung back and forth between Three and Four Pinocchios \u2014 given that, even though Plame apologized, she did tweet an anti-Semitic article \u2014 but the Nazi symbol superimposed on her eyes tipped us to Four.", "lang": "en"}
