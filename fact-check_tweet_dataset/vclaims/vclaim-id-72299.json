When the polls are even, when they leave them alone and do them properly, I\u2019m leading. But you see these polls, where they\u2019re polling Democrats -- \u2018how\u2019s Trump doing\u2019 \u2018oh he\u2019s down\u2019 -- they\u2019re polling Democrats!\"\n\nWe were curious about Trump\u2019s charge of bogus polling.\n\nTrump is wrong that Wikileaks shows Podesta rigging the polls against him. He\u2019s referring to an email obtained by the hacker group from Clinton\u2019s 2008 (not 2016) campaign on what appears to be internal polling (not public ones published by media organizations). And oversampling in this instance means polling more people in a specific demographic group for analysis -- not ignoring Republican voters to suppress their votes.\n\nIn short, oversampling is a common polling technique and not, as Trump says, one of \"voter suppression.\"\n\nThe email, one of thousands of Podesta emails released by Wikileaks, is a January 2008 exchange between Democratic strategists and employees of the Atlas Project, a political polling and data firm.\n\nAtlas sent over 98 pages of polling and media recommendations that includes several recommendations to oversample minorities, independent voters and Democrats in certain states.\n\nExperts told us the technical term for this is \"stratified disproportionate sampling,\" but most pollsters use \"oversample\" as a shorthand. It\u2019s done not to skew the polls, but to gauge the attitudes of specific demographic groups, who would not be a statistically large enough group to analyze if sampled randomly.\n\nFor example, in a national sample of 1,000 eligible voters, only 12.5 percent, or 125, would be black. To accurately gauge black attitudes on certain issues, a pollster may oversample 500 black eligible voters (four times more than the random sample). Then, in analyzing the full sample, the sample of blacks would be assigned a weight of 0.25 to represent the overall population.\n\n\"If the analysis of the group is done separately, it is simply a large sample of that group. If combined with all respondents the oversample is weighted down proportionately so that the overall sample is representative of the population as a whole,\" said Charles Franklin, the director of Marquette Law School Poll. \"This is a standard procedure and does not mean the weighted sample gives disproportionate weight to the oversampled group.\"\n\nThe Pew Research Center explained that it, for example, oversampled Hispanics for an in-depth look at the U.S. Hispanic population in June 2016. Analysts then weighted Hispanics when looking at the overall population to have both \"more precise estimates when looking at Hispanics specifically\" and also \"the correct distribution when looking at the sample as a whole.\"\n\nRoger Tourangeau, president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, pointed out that monthly federal surveys on unemployment do the same. To get an accurate understanding of joblessness in Wyoming, pollsters would need to call a number of Wyoming residents disportionate to the number of people in the entire country.\n\nTrump\u2019s overall charges of skewed polls is \"nonsense,\" Tourangeau said, \"Nobody wants to produce a biased assessment and look like an idiot (on Election Day). Why would people deliberately get it wrong? It\u2019s business suicide.\"\n\nTrump said, \"Wikileaks also shows how John Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling Democrats, a voter suppression technique.\"\n\nA leaked email shows the Clinton campaign of 2008 consulted data firm that suggest oversampling in what is likely internal polling. The term refers to a common technique used by pollsters to analyze demographics groups more precisely than possible in a random sample.", "lang": "en"}
