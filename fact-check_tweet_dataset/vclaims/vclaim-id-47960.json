There were no flags in the square in the weeks before these were put up \u2014EU or otherwise. These flags were raised sometime between Friday 11 and Saturday 12 October.\n\nAdditionally, the EU flag is not officially in Westminster or Whitehall, to begin with. The EU flag has previously been flown in Parliament Square alongside the flags of other European countries (not just of the EU) to mark Europe Day.\n\nThe flags are also not a permanent feature in the square\u2014a scroll through Google street view shows a variety of flags being erected and removed from the square. This has been due to certain national and international celebrations.\n\nThe Union Jack is traditionally flown around London during the state opening of parliament.
