The claim is inaccurate.\n\nAvailable data from the Social Weather Stations (SWS) and Pulse Asia, the two research organizations mentioned by Roque, do not support his claim.\n\nOther presidents fared better than Duterte when their respective first survey ratings are compared to their scores a year after, or the closest available time.\n\nSWS has been releasing quarterly net satisfaction ratings, an estimate of how happy or not people are with the president, since the Corazon Aquino administration. It also releases net trust ratings of public officials, albeit not regularly.\n\nFormer presidents Fidel Ramos and Benigno \u201cNoynoy\u201d Aquino III saw the least dip in their SWS net satisfaction ratings, losing 4 percentage points around their first year in office.\n\nIn contrast, Duterte\u2019s net satisfaction rating dropped 16 points in the period covering his first year, which is still bigger than Gloria Macapagal Arroyo\u2019s 8-point drop in the same comparable period.\n\nCorazon Aquino saw a 17-point drop in her net satisfaction rating in a span of 17 months, while Joseph Estrada lost 32 points in 13 months.\n\nMeanwhile, Pulse Asia began releasing since the Estrada presidency trust ratings, which are measured in degrees, and performance ratings, which measure the public\u2019s approval of government officials.\n\nEstrada was the only president to see his trust rating increase, by 1 point, early in his presidency.\n\nDuterte lost 11 points in his trust rating in 14 months, while Aquino lost six and Arroyo seven in 13 months.\n\nIn terms of performance ratings, Duterte lost 6 points in his first year; Aquino seven in 13 months; Arroyo six in 13 months; and Estrada 21 in 14 months.\n\nPulse Asia, Comparative Performance and Trust Ratings of Presidents (May 1999 to September 2017)\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
