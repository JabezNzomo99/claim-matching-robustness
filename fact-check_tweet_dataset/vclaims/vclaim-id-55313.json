The notice letter appears to have been fabricated.\n\nThe claim that Costco issued a recall of its Kirkland Signature brand bath tissue went viral over the weekend amid the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. This particular post features an alleged letter from the wholesale retailer notifying shoppers of the recall.\n\n\u201cDue to recent global events our bath tissue has been contaminated with Coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19),\u201d reads part of the supposed notice. \u201cThe bath tissue has been contaminated due to the item being manufactured in China.\u201d\n\nThe notice contains several spelling and grammatical errors and offers no means of contacting the manufacturer, making it immediately suspect.\n\nCostco publicly lists current and past recall notices on its website. A search of that list turned up no recalls of Kirkland Signature brand bath tissue in the previous 120 days. Nor do any notices appear in the Consumer Product Safety Commission database.\n\nThe wholesale retailer has not issued any coronavirus-related recalls to date.

A recent study by U.S. government researchers found that the virus can survive up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to several days on plastic.\n\nHowever, there is \u201cno evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods,\u201d according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.", "lang": "en"}
