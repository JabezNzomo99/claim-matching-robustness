And during that time if they realise that there are no men in the house, they attack the women, cut them and steal their kidneys.\u201d\n\nThe post, which was shared by one Md Hassan in July 2018 has already been shared more than 8000 times. The most recent post is from January 14, 2019. BOOM found two other posts from January 2019, which may suggest the image is circulating once again.\n\nThe caption reads like colloquial Bangla spoken in Bangladesh.\n\nThis is not the first time the same image has been used to spread rumours online with life threatening consequences.\n\nIt went viral in different parts of India last year with messages that falsely claimed the transgenders were child kidnappers.\n\nThe photo first featured on Telugu website \u2018teluguap2tg.com\u2019 in May 2018.\n\nThe incident happened in the Mahbubnagar district of Telangana, in May last year, when villagers chased and beat these two transgenders thinking them to be abductors. Read the story here.\n\nThe image has also been debunked by Alt News in the past. \n\n\n\nThe photo is part of a chain of Whatsapp forwards, rumours and fake posts, which circulated in India in 2017 and 2018 leading to the deaths of over 30 people in separate mob lynching incidents.\n\nThe messages alleged that the child abductors not only kidnapped young children but also killed and harvested their organs. \n\n\n\nRumours of child kidnappers on the prowl across Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar and Gujarat were sparked by images and videos from unrelated incidents including a public safety ad from Pakistan that was maliciously edited. BOOM was the first website to debunk the video from Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
