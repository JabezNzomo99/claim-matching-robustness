The claim is false; the photo has been doctored from an original image showing the 2017 swearing-in ceremony of a Bharatiya Janata Party politician in Himachal Pradesh, which Modi attended.\n\nThe photo was published in this Facebook post uploaded on April 8, 2019, which has been shared scores of times.\n\nThe caption says: \u201cIn support of Champions of Earth Narendra Modi jee...tsunami start...with huge waves...Namo again..Plz share to all the people of India.\u201d\n\n\u201cChampions of Earth\u201d is a reference to an award which Modi received from the United Nations in 2018 for his contributions to the environment.
