Ellen DeGeneres, Oprah Winfrey, Jimmy Kimmel and Piers Morgan have all been baselessly accused of such crimes, and a July 13 Facebook post adds Hanks to that supposed list, claiming he was arrested for pedophilia in Australia.\n\nThe post features four pictures of the actor, including two close-up shots of his feet with red circles drawn around his ankles. \u201cLook who has a new ankle bracelet!\u201d reads text accompanying the image. \u201cSome of you don\u2019t know it but Mr. Hanks was arrested in Australia for pedophilia.\u201d\n\nThe post further claims that Hanks\u2019s statement in March announcing that he and his wife had tested positive for COVID-19 while filming a movie in Australia was a cover for the fact that he was actually under house arrest.\n\nHowever, there is no truth to these claims. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to suggest Hanks was arrested or charged with any child sex crime. Celebrities often make headlines when they have run-ins with the law. Had Hanks been on house arrest, it would certainly be covered in the media, yet no reporting about it exists.\n\nThere is also no evidence that Hanks is still in Australia, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. Multiple news reports state that Hanks and his wife returned to the U.S. at the end of March after self-quarantining in Australia.\n\nIn the U.S., convicted sex offenders must register with the Department of Justice upon their release from prison, but there is no record of Hanks on the Department of Justice\u2019s national sex offender registry. Nor does he appear on California\u2019s sex offender registry.

There is no mention of an ankle monitor by the Daily Mail, and it does not appear from the pictures that Hanks is wearing one. Rather, it seems the bottom of his pants gathered around his ankles.\n\n\u201cDespite having already beaten COVID-19, Tom Hanks wasn\u2019t willing to take any chances on Wednesday, with the Forrest Gump star covering his face with a green bandana when he ventured out in Los Angeles,\u201d reads the Daily Mail caption of the image showing Hanks standing outside an open car door.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
