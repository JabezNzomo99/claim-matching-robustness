{"title": "Joe Arpaio Not Named to Replace John McCain", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.factcheck.org", "date": "2018-08-30T11:43:18+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-22538", "url": "https://www.factcheck.org/2018/08/joe-arpaio-not-named-to-replace-john-mccain/", "vclaim": "Q: Was Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff, appointed to finish John McCain\u2019s term in the Senate? \n\n\n\nA: No. That claim is made up \u2014 the Arizona governor has not yet named a replacement. \n\n\n\nJohn McCain, Arizona\u2019s longtime senator, died on Aug. 25, four-and-a-half years before his term ends in early 2023.\n\nAccording to Arizona law, Gov. Doug Ducey is required to fill that vacancy with someone from the same party \u2014 in this case, a Republican. Voters will elect a new senator in the 2020 general election.\n\nSo far, Ducey has not signaled whom he will name to the seat.\n\nBut it is clear that the former Maricopa County sheriff, Joe Arpaio, has not been named.\n\nThe claim that he had been sworn in to McCain\u2019s seat was initially made on a website called Trumpbetrayed.us, which is part of a network of sites that describes its content as satire aimed at provoking conservatives.\n\nThe story was soon copied and posted as if it were news by a site that has no satire disclaimer, though. That site, Thelibertyraise.com, is registered to an owner in Macedonia.\n\nThe story claims: \u201cSheriff Joe Arpaio is now Senator Joe Arpaio. President Trump, after ordering the Governor of New Mexico to appoint George Bailey to the board of the Savings and Loan committee, oversaw the swearing in of Arpaio by the Secretary of Agriculture.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the first paragraph, and, already, there are some red flags that indicate the story isn\u2019t true. First, filling a vacant Senate seat is governed by state law, and in Arizona, where McCain was a senator, that responsibility lies with the governor, not the president. Second, George Bailey is the main character who works at Bailey Brothers Building and Loan in the classic movie \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has praised Arpaio as a patriot and granted the former sheriff a full pardon after he was convicted of contempt for ignoring an earlier court order that his office stop detaining people it suspected of being in the country without documentation.\n\nAlso, Arpaio did recently seek a Senate seat in Arizona. He ran in the Republican primary to fill the seat that will be left open by Sen. Jeff Flake, who is not seeking reelection. But Arpaio came in third in the Aug. 28 primary, bringing in 19 percent of the vote.\n\nSo, the former sheriff is not on his way to the Senate \u2014 for either McCain\u2019s or Flake\u2019s seat.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nU.S. Senate.
