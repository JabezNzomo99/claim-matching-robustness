Roy Blunt and Secretary of State Jason Kander.\n\nBlunt said Kander supports President Obama\u2019s plan to close Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. military prison in Cuba housing suspected terrorists, and transfer prisoners to mainland prisons. Blunt tweeted out a petition against the plan 11 times on his campaign account between April 18 and April 20.\n\nThe petition says, \"Jason Kander supports his plan to bring the remaining suspected terrorists to U.S. soil. Tell national Democrats and Jason Kander that bringing suspected terrorists to U.S. soil puts Missouri families at risk.\"\n\nThis statement piqued our interest, because Kander made headlines in February for coming out against this plan. So we decided to look into the claim.\n\nThe Missouri House passed a resolution later that year that opposed the closure. It urged Congress to \"reject any act of asylum, containment, transport, imprisonment, or medical care in regard to suspected terrorists from any United States operated foreign prison present within the State of Missouri.\"\n\nAt the end of February of this year, the White House again released a plan for closing the detention center. Part of the plan includes transferring detainees who cannot be released in foreign countries to a U.S. prison facility.\n\n\"Our focus right now needs to be defeating ISIS, and we can\u2019t risk the possibility that the terrorists housed at Guantanamo could rejoin the battlefield,\" said Kander. \"These dangerous prisoners should not be transferred to the United States, and I strongly urge President Obama to reconsider this plan.\"\n\n\"He did not think that a non-binding resolution in the Missouri legislature was the best way to keep us safe from terrorists,\" Hayden said.\n\nBut Kander never officially stated his position on closing Gitmo until February. Even the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which seeks to get Republicans elected to the Senate, released a video last November saying the committee couldn\u2019t find his stance on bringing the prisoners to the U.S.\n\nBlunt says Kander supports Obama\u2019s plan to bring the remaining prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to the U.S. Kander voted against a 2009 resolution in the Missouri legislature that called on Congress to keep the facility open. But that doesn\u2019t mean he supported Obama\u2019s plan to close the prison.", "lang": "en"}
