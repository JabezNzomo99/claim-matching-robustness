{"title": "Analysis | President Trump has made 10,796 false or misleading claims over 869 days", "subtitle": "The president has been averaging about 16 fishy claims a day since he crossed the 10,000 threshold in April.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-06-10T07:00:24.329Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86276", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/10/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/", "vclaim": "About one-fifth of these claims are about immigration, his signature issue \u2014 a percentage that has grown since the government shut down over funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In fact, his most repeated claim \u2014 172 times \u2014 is that his border wall is being built. Congress balked at funding the concrete barrier he envisioned, so he has tried to pitch bollard fencing and repairs of existing barriers as \u201ca wall.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for repeating false claims is demonstrated by the fact that The Fact Checker database has recorded more than 300 instances in which he has repeated a variation of the same claim at least three times. He also now has earned 21 \u201cBottomless Pinocchios,\u201d claims that have earned Three or Four Pinocchios and which have been repeated at least 20 times.\n\nThis is a flawed estimate. The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated in a 2017 report that \u201cthe economic cost of the opioid crisis was $504.0 billion, or 2.8 percent of GDP\u201d in 2015. But that\u2019s not all a result of drugs coming across the border. It also \u201cincludes individuals who abuse prescription painkillers such as OxyContin and Vicodin and individuals who abuse heroin or other illicit opioids,\u201d the report said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that prescription drugs were involved in more than 35 percent of all opioid overdose deaths in 2017.\n\nTrump never gets this correct. There are two types of funding for NATO: direct funding and indirect funding. Direct funding, for military-related operations, maintenance and headquarters activity, is based on gross national income \u2014 the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country \u2014 and adjusted regularly. With the largest economy in NATO, the United States pays the largest share \u2014 about 22 percent. Germany is second, with about 15 percent. Indirect funding refers to how much a country's defense spending is a percentage of the gross domestic product, and NATO members have set a goal of 2 percent of GDP by 2022. Germany in 2018 spent 1.23 percent of its GDP on defense, but this money does not go to NATO.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where Trump gets this 30 percent estimate. The studies we reviewed indicate the North American Free Trade Agreement had a modest effect on the U.S. economy. Auto industry representatives and independent analysts seem to agree the NAFTA dynamics have helped rather than hindered automakers with U.S. operations. Mexico was a relatively small player in North American vehicle production before NAFTA, producing only 3 percent of the continent\u2019s vehicles in 1987, and it now makes about 20 percent of light vehicles. The U.S. share of North American vehicle production was 70 percent in 2007 and is projected to be about 60 percent in 2020, according to a 2016 report by the Center for Automotive Research. But about 80 percent of Mexico\u2019s production is for export. Mexico has signed nearly 50 free-trade agreements, and so much of the new auto production there is coming from Asia and Europe, not the United States. Moreover, unlike Mexico, the United States cannot export to many South American countries duty free because it does not have the same free-trade agreements.\n\nThe Central American migration phenomenon to the United States is driven by a mix of factors, including rampant gang violence and poverty in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Mexico has deported people from those countries more than 2 million times since 2001, and its numbers for apprehensions and deportations rival those of the United States. Migrants have a right under international law to petition any country for asylum, including the United States.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking in tens of billions of dollars [from China]. We had a 3.2 [percent] GDP first quarter. It\u2019s always 1 percent, less than 1 percent, it\u2019s always the worst quarter \u2014 we\u2019re at 3.2, a point and a half above schedule. And you know why? Because so much money\u2019s coming in from China. We\u2019ve never took in any money from China.\u201d\n\nVirtually every economist says that Trump\u2019s trade wars have helped slow economic growth, not enhance it. The money raised from tariffs is just a drop in the fiscal bucket. Meanwhile, tariffs have been collected on Chinese goods since the early days of the Republic. President George Washington signed the Tariff Act of 1789, when trade between China and the United States was already established. Tariffs on Chinese goods have generated at least $8 billion every year since 2009. But it\u2019s not China that pays the tariffs; it\u2019s American importers who generally pass on the costs to Americans in the form of higher prices.\n\nThis statement requires context. In the past 15 years, developing nations have gained a larger share of agricultural trade, though the percentage held by North America has declined only slightly, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Meanwhile, U.S. agricultural exports grew steadily over the past two decades, reaching $140.47 billion in 2017, from $56.2 billion in 1995. Moreover, the United States has maintained a surplus in agricultural trade since 1960, which the agency says has helped counter the persistent deficit in nonagricultural U.S. merchandise trade.", "lang": "en"}
