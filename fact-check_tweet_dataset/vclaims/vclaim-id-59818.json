Through this article, let\u2019s fact-check the claim.\n\nClaim: Design of Ram Mandir which is supposed to be built in Ayodhya. Fact: The original video on Kens Studio YouTube channel is uploaded on 03 June 2014, whereas the Supreme court verdict on Ram Mandir case is pronounced on 09 Nov 2019. Also, multiple news agencies have reported the supposed design of the temple which is different from the one shared in the post. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we ran a search on YouTube using the keywords \u20183D animation temple\u2019, we found a similar video on a channel named Kems Studio which was uploaded on 03 June 2014.\n\nThe Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya\u2019s Ram Mandir case is pronounced on 09 Nov 2019, years later than the earliest upload of the video found on YouTube. The original Supreme Court judgement can be read here.\n\nWhen we reached out to Kems Studio through phone they said that the design which is going viral is actually designed for a Jain temple in Andhra Pradesh. Also, they explicitly said that the design is not related to Ram Mandhir in Ayodhya. Even in the beginning of the video it is showed that the location of the temple as Tirupati. Also, in the video we can see many Jain idols.\n\nMultiple news agencies have recently reported that the Ram Mandir model designed three decades ago by Chandrakant Sompura (with some modifications) will be the design of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir. These news reports can be found here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, old 3D animation temple design is falsely shared as the design of the Ram Mandir which is to be built in Ayodhya.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
