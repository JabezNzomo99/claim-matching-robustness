Delhi legislative assembly elections are set to be held on February 8 and Gambhir\u2019s tweet attempted to portray the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in poor light.\n\nAt the start of the viral video, a notice is visible on the building\u2019s gate however the camera does not focus on the notice. Journalist Uday Rana Singh tweeted a close-up of the notice which informs that the school was relocated to SBV JJ Colony on October 9, 2019. If one notices carefully, the photograph has been taken at the same location \u2013 the art on the gate is identical.\n\nThe official Twitter handle of AAP quote-tweeted Gambhir\u2019s tweet and wrote that the building featured in the video is no longer a functional school. \u201cThe school you visited has been shifted to SBV JJ Colony in October 2019,\u201d tweeted the party along with a video where the notice is clearly visible.\n\nSingh shared a photograph of the makeshift school provided for the students. \u201cI also visited the makeshift school in Khichdipur. They\u2019ve been studying here since October as their school is under renovation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe misinformation was also called out by Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia. He wrote, \u201cThe notice on the building\u2019s gate itself says that the school was relocated to a neighbouring school six months ago as it is undergoing renovation.\u201d\n\nBJP MP Gautam Gambhir shared a video of a dilapidated building to suggest that it is a functional school in AAP\u2019s Delhi. A notice on the building\u2019s gate however informs that the school has been shifted to another location.", "lang": "en"}
