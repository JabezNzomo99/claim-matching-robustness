The post below was made by a Facebook page \u2018Har har modi ghar ghar modi\u2019.\n\nThe cartoon attempts to show Congress as terror-sympathisers. It is viral on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.\n\nNo such cartoon was published by The New York Times. The viral caricature is a photoshopped version of the original cartoon that was published by the LA Timesin a 2012 article \u2013 \u201cRepublican Party suckles at the breast of Big Business.\u201d\n\nA different photoshopped version of this cartoon was debunked by Alt News in March 2019 when it was shared targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Former Indian cricketer and Lok Sabha MP Kirti Azad had tweeted the caricature. He later took down his tweet.\n\nA 7-year-old caricature published in LA Times was photoshopped with Rahul Gandhi\u2019s face to falsely portray that foreign media as critical of Congress.", "lang": "en"}
