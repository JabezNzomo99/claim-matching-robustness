But there is no evidence for the claim. Abubakar\u2019s campaign have not announced any ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram. Abubakar\u2019s spokesperson said that no ceasefire plan had been made and that they had no plans to cede Nigerian territory to the group, if in power.\n\nThe video claims the deal would give Boko Haram some land and autonomy in the northeastern state of Borno, which has been the epicentre of the insurgency since 2009, and oil fields in exchange for a ceasefire.\n\nThere is no evidence that either Abubakar\u2019s campaign or his Peoples Democratic Party have announced any such plan and it is not in his manifesto. In a statement to AFP, his spokesperson Segun Showunmi said: \u201cThis is high level criminal misinformation that must be investigated.\u201d\n\nThe video was posted on Facebook on January 8 on a page called \u201cMake Nigeria Worse Again\u201d. The page title plays on the theme of Abubakar\u2019s campaign, \u201cMake Nigeria Work Again\u201d. The page has been liked by more than 9,700 accounts and followed by more than 10,000 accounts.\n\nThe video is captioned \u201cWe must stop Atiku's hellish plan to GIVE AWAY parts of Borno State and oil to Boko Haram in exchange for a cease-fire\u201d. It also claims Abubakar plans to give Nigeria to \u201cterrorists\u201d.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than 190,000 times. Pictures and posts carrying the claims in the video have been shared more than 3,000 times.\n\nA picture posted on January 6 by a Facebook page called \u201cNaija 24h\u201d is the earliest mention of the claim found by AFP. It posts a picture appearing to show militants alongside a picture with Abubakar. Over the image, a text claims, \u201cAtiku reveals plan to hand over land in Borno State and oil to Boko Haram.\u201d\n\nThe picture has been shared more than 3,000 times.\n\nAbubakar is a wealthy businessman and ex-vice president, from Adamawa State in northeast Nigeria. He is the main challenger to President Muhammadu Buhari in presidential elections next month. Both candidates have pledged to tackle insecurity in the country.\n\nWhile Chad exploits oil reserves commercially from shared basins under Lake Chad from its side of the border, exploration on the Nigerian side in northern Borno has been curtailed by the violence.", "lang": "en"}
