Shadow Inc., a technology firm owned by campaign consulting nonprofit ACRONYM, created the app.\n\nSome social media users have claimed Buttigieg owns Shadow Inc., while others alleged that the Indiana mayor either funded or created the app that caused a major delay in Iowa voting results.\n\n\u201cSo Pete Buttigieg won Iowa???\u201d wrote one user. \u201cHe owns a company that owns the app they used to count votes and Pete Buttigieg won?\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A New York Times Article About Nevada Primary Polls)\n\nThe claim, however, is false. Campaign finance records reveal Buttigieg\u2019s campaign paid the firm $21,250 in July for \u201csoftware rights and subscriptions\u201d that were not developed specifically for the Iowa caucuses. Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, do not appear to have any ownership stake in Shadow Inc., per his financial disclosure forms.\n\n\u201cA presidential candidate is required to disclose all assets and spousal assets, including stock, on their financial disclosure form,\u201d explained Brendan Fischer, the federal reform director at the nonpartisan watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, in an email to the Daily Caller. \u201cI suspect that passing connections between Buttigieg\u2019s campaign and Shadow have been spun into a conspiracy on social media.\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s campaign did not help develop the app, a campaign spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press.\n\nOther presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Democratic parties, like Texas Democratic Party, have previously paid Shadow Inc. for similar services, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party began a partial recanvass of the state\u2019s precinct results at the request of the Sanders and Buttigieg campaigns over the weekend, CNN reported.", "lang": "en"}
