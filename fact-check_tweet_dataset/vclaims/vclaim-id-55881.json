BOOM found that the original placard, which Yechury is holding, had the text, \"Immediately pay Rs 7500 for three months to all outside the income tax bracket\" written on it. Karat was holding a placard with the text \"provide free 10kgs foodgrains per month for six months to all needy individuals\".\n\n\n\nAlso read: No, Photo Does Not Show Indian Soldier Injured In India-China Clash\n\nThe edited photographs are viral with a fake claim in Hindi which translates to: \"Identify these disloyal leftist traitors.

There was a major escalation of border tensions between the Indian and Chinese troops at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Galwan Valley region of eastern Ladakh on the night of June 15.

However, the viral images were not doctored.\n\nThe official Twitter handle of the CPI(M) had posted the original images that have been morphed and made viral. The rally was against several government policies that, according to the party, are not in favour of the labourers and the poor. It was not against the Indian Army, as claimed by the viral posts. \n\n\n\nThe original images were tweeted by the CPI (M)'s verified handle with the text \"All India Protest against Modi govt's anti-people policies. #PeopleProtestModiGovt\"\n\nThe pan India protest had commenced on June 15. Verified Facebook page of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) ran a Facebook live during the protest. \"All India Protest against Modi govt's anti-people policies. Gen. Sec. Com Sitaram Yechury along with other comrades protesting against Modi govt's devastating policies at AKG Bhawan, New Delhi,\" the caption read.\n\nAdditionally, below is a comparison of the edited and original photographs from the event.", "lang": "en"}
