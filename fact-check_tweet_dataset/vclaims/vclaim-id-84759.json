BOOM found that while many of these number are old and no longer active, others are specific only to certain cities in the country.\n\nWe looked at several such posts falsely viral as helpline numbers for women: \n\n\n\nA currently deactivated helpline number is being shared as the Nirbhaya helpline (9833312222) and urges people to leave messages on this number in the case of any emergencies. \n\n\n\nThe helpline was originally activated by the Mumbai Railways Police in 2015 and was extensively covered in the media. This number is defunct and out of service from 2018. This service was meant for the women using the suburban railway system across the city and not available across the country as the WhatsApp message indicates. Read our story here.\n\nOld Nirbhaya Helpline Claimed To Be From Telangana\n\n\n\nSocial media was abuzz with claims that the Telangana police had initiated a new helpline (9969777888) for assisting women in the state. This helpline was claimed to track mobile phones and the vehicles of the women. The Hyderabad police took to Twitter to debunk these claims. They insisted that they had not come up with such a helpline and urged citizens to not believe these claims.\n\nThe said number was also a Mumbai based initiative albeit by the police and was active between 2014 and 2017. This number has been circulating as a helpline number for quite a few years and both Delhi police and Bengaluru police have debunked this in the past.\n\nLudhiana Helpline Claimed To Be For Maharashtra \n\n\n\nAnother WhatsApp forward stating that the Maharashtra government and police launched a free ride scheme for women to avail free rides between 10 pm and 6 am by calling the numbers 1091 and 7837018555. BOOM received this message on its Whatsapp helpline (+91-7700906111) for checking the veracity of the news. \n\n\n\nBOOM found that the service is exclusively for Ludhiana and that the Ludhiana police had initiated this on the 1st of December. This service is currently only applicable for Ludhiana. \n\n\n\nOn November 28, a 26-year-old doctor from Telangana was found murdered and gangraped and her body charred to death. The incident which caused to outrage in the country led to the arrests of four people - Mohammed alias Areef, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen and Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu.\n\nIn a turn of events, all the four accused were killed in an encounter by the Cyberabad police on December 6, when they were taken to the scene of crime for a reconstruction of the incident.\n\nThe helpline number 1091 is a pan- India helpline commissioned by the National Commission for Women.", "lang": "en"}
