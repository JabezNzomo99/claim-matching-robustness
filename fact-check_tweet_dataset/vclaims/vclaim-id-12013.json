A reverse image search shows that the picture has been doctored. In the original photo, Michelle's dress is plain and the shirt held by Barack contains a message for the victims of a 2015 church shooting in Charleston, USA.\n\nThe image in the post published on January 20 appears to show Michelle wearing a black dress emblazoned with a large green tick and the word \u201cyes\u201d, and Barack holding a black t-shirt with a design in the centre featuring a gold number 8.\n\nA golden \u201c8\u201d and a tick have both been used as campaign logos by the Philippines\u2019 opposition party and its supporters ahead of midterm elections in May 2019.\n\n\n\nA reverse image search found that the original picture of the couple was tweeted by Barack Obama on June 26, 2015, when he was still US president and days after a deadly mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn the tweeted image, Michelle\u2019s dress is black, without any markings, while the shirt that Barack is holding is white with the words \u201cHATE WON\u2019T WIN\u201d printed in the middle and a cropped black-and-white image of two hands forming the shape of a heart around the text.\n\nThe tweet says: \u201cSo inspired by the grace shown by the Simmons family and all the victims\u2019 families in Charleston. #HateWontWin\u201d\n\nThe 2015 Charleston church shooting resulted in the deaths of nine African-Americans. Here is AFP\u2019s report on the event from the time.\n\nThe main opposition party in the Philippines, the Liberal Party (LP), is using the campaign tagline #OtsoDiretso, which when translated into English means \u201cVote for 8 straight\u201d -- a reference to the eight senatorial candidates fielded by the LP for the upcoming elections.\n\nHere is a Facebook post from LP president Francis Pangilinan featuring a golden number 8 surrounded by the candidates\u2019 names and the campaign tagline #OtsoDiretso:\n\nThe LP has produced campaign freebies with the same design, as seen in this tweet.\n\nLP supporters have also created campaign materials referencing the number 8, such as this image featuring a Nike \u2018tick\u2019 with the slogan \u201cJust Do 8\u201d, a play on the sports brand\u2019s \u201cJust Do it\u201d logo.\n\nThe doctored image of the Obamas was shared in a Facebook group with more than 8,400 members which supports Philippine Vice President Leonora \u201cLeni\u201d Robredo, an LP member.\n\nComments on the misleading Facebook post such as the one below showed that some users believed the Obamas really had endorsed the eight LP candidates.\n\nAnother thanked \u201cMr President Barack Obama for supporting LP\u201d then said in Filipino: \u201cLet\u2019s vote straight LP\u201d.\n\nThe image has been repeatedly doctored, for example a web service here offers to edit any logo or slogan onto the picture of the Obamas.", "lang": "en"}
