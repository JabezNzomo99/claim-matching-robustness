But there\u2019s no evidence Kissinger called Trump \u201cthe one true leader,\u201d or said he \u201cputs America and its people first,\u201d as a popular post circulating on Facebook claims.\n\nThe post, which has been copied and reposted several times, features a picture of Kissinger and a long block of text that attributes several bogus quotes to him. Two of the quotes, however, are accurate (or close to accurate) representations of what Kissinger said in an interview on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Dec. 18, 2018.\n\nThe first quote in the post is almost word for word what Kissinger said:\n\nIn the CBS News interview, Kissinger said:\n\nThe Facebook post also accurately quotes what Kissinger said after that:\n\nFacebook post: \u201cEvery country now has to consider two things: One, their perception that the previous president, or the outgoing president, basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessments of their necessities. And secondly, that there is a new president who\u2019s asking a lot of unfamiliar questions. And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it.\u201d\n\nKissinger\u2019s remarks from that part of the interview were:\n\nKissinger, Dec. 18, 2016: Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven\u2019t seen. So it is a shocking experience to them that he came into office, at the same time, extraordinary opportunity. And I believe he has the possibility of going down in history as a very considerable president, because every country now has two things to consider, one, their perception that the previous president or the outgoing president basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessment of their necessities, and, secondly, that here is a new president who is asking a lot of unfamiliar questions. And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it. I\u2019m not saying it will. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s an extraordinary opportunity.\n\nBut the other three quotes in the Facebook post appear to have been fabricated. They weren\u2019t made in his CBS News interview or in any other public remarks that we could find.\n\nWe found no evidence Kissinger said:\n\nFacebook post: \u201cLiberals and all those who favor (Hillary) Clinton will never admit it. They will never admit that he is the one true leader. The man is doing changes like never before and does all of it for the sake of this nation\u2019s people. After eight years of tyranny, we finally see a difference.\u201d\n\nOr that Kissinger was quoted as saying this:\n\nOr that Kissinger \u201cso boldly\u201d made this statement about Trump:\n\nSo, two of the quotes are close to correct. But the rest appear to have been made up.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nU.S. Department of State.
