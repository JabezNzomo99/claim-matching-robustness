BOOM found that the news graphic announcing the government's decision is doctored.\n\nUnder its 'Unlock 2' guidelines, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has clearly stated that schools and colleges will not be allowed to reopen till July 31. The MHA has not come up with any guidelines on the reopening of schools and colleges after the end of July, yet.\n\nOne of the two news graphics from Aaj Tak HD channel displays PM Modi's picture with a caption in Hindi reading, \"Modi Government has issued an order for reopening of schools and colleges. The government has green lit the reopening of these institutes\" (Translated from: \u0938\u094d\u0915\u0942\u0932 \u0915\u0949\u0932\u0947\u091c \u0916\u094b\u0932\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0906\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u091c\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u092b \u0938\u0947 \u0939\u0930\u0940 \u091d\u0902\u0921\u0940)\n\nBOOM received this image on its WhatsApp helpline with the request for verification.\n\nA Facebook post talks about the same order but does not have PM Modi's picture.

The Ministry of Home Affairs debunked the same message on May 26, 2020.\n\nOn performing a reverse image search with the Aaj Tak HD clipping breaking news about the government reopening schools, BOOM found that the text format on this graphic does not follow Aaj Tak HD's text format. We could not find this video on the news channel's social media channels.\n\nBOOM compared the viral graphic with Aaj Tak HD's other graphics. Firstly, the picture suggesting that the Modi government has decided on reopening of schools and colleges, does not fit into the frame below the breaking news. Secondly, Modi is written differently in both the pictures. The font size in the template is larger than the normal template followed by Aaj Tak HD.\n\nThe India News screenshot has been viral since May, 2020. Following this screenshot, the Ministry of Home Affairs took to Twitter to clarify that they have not announced any notifications relating to the reopening of schools and colleges.\n\nIn its June 29 guidelines for Unlock 2, the MHA clarified that educational institutes will continue to remain shut till July 31. However, the Ministry of Human Resource Development did permit schools and colleges to begin online classes for students that were not giving final year examinations.\n\nAccording to news reports, the Ministry is asking states to consult parents before reaching a final decision with regards to reopening schools.\n\nAlso Read: Morphed Image Of PM Modi And Amit Shah Viral With Misleading Claims", "lang": "en"}
