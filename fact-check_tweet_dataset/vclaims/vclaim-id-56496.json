Only approved medical tests can detect infection. Drinking water does not prevent people from contracting the disease.\n\nThe post, which has been widely shared on Facebook, Instagram and other platforms, claims that coronavirus patients can develop 50 percent pulmonary fibrosis if they wait too long to go to the hospital. It also suggests that holding one\u2019s breath for 10 seconds can determine if a person has the disease and that drinking water every 15 minutes prevents infection.\n\nSocial media users have falsely attributed the claims to Japanese doctors and Taiwanese experts, despite numerous fact-checkers debunking them.(RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A UNICEF Letter About Preventing Coronavirus)\n\n\u201cFibrosis is a late scarring process,\u201d Loren Raunch, a community emergency room doctor at Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, California, told Mother Jones. \u201cYou may have 50 percent of your lung affected by the virus, causing pneumonia or fluid in your lungs. But fibrosis \u2013 that is not correct.\u201d\n\nCommon symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The World Health Organization (WHO) also notes that people infected with the virus may experience \u201caches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea\u201d and, in severe cases, breathing difficulties. These symptoms typically appear within 14 days after exposure.\n\nThe claim that Taiwanese experts developed a self-test for COVID-19 doesn\u2019t hold up either. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any evidence that Taiwanese researchers developed such a test online or that it\u2019s a valid test, and the Taiwan Fact Check Center debunked the notion in a Feb. 2 article.\n\n\u201cThis approach may be helpful in identifying persons with more serious lung disease,\u201d Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine, told The Associated Press. \u201cBut it will not identify persons who are infected and have mild to no symptoms.\u201d\n\nThe only definitive way to determine if a person has contracted COVID-19 is to take an approved test.

When the virus is in the stomach \u2014 the hydrochloric acid in your stomach will kill the germs.\u201d\n\nThe WHO Philippines Twitter account debunked the claim about drinking water every 15 minutes, saying, \u201cWhile staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.\u201d\n\nSome iterations of the Facebook post cite a Stanford University internal message board but, according to Stanford Health Care spokeswoman Lisa Kim, that attribution is false.\n\n\u201cA widely distributed email about COVID-19 that is attributed to a \u2018Stanford Hospital board member\u2019 contains inaccurate information,\u201d Kim told the Caller in an email. \u201cIt did not come from Stanford Medicine.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
