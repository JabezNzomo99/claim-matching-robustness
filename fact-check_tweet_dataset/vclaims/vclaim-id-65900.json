Protests against police brutality \u2014 some violent \u2014 spread swiftly across the U.S. and other countries, and numerous cities were placed under curfew.\n\nLess than two weeks later, some Snopes readers questioned whether U.S. President Donald Trump had truly stated in a speech about employment statistics that it was a \u201cgreat day\u201d for Floyd, suggesting that Floyd was \u201clooking down and saying, \u2018This is a great thing that\u2019s happening for our country.'\u201d\n\nTrump did make these comments, drawing immediate backlash.\n\nFloyd died in police custody on May 25. Video of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck until he lost consciousness went viral and sparked international outrage.\n\nTrump\u2019s commentary came during an event at the White House Rose Garden in which he discussed U.S. job numbers in the month of May. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, stay-at-home orders have resulted in massive unemployment. He appeared to veer off prepared remarks, stating:\n\nEqual justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement regardless of race, color, gender or creed. They have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement. They have to receive it. We all saw what happened last week. We can\u2019t let that happen. Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying, \u201cThis is a great thing that\u2019s happening for our country.\u201d It\u2019s a great day for him, it\u2019s a great day for everyone. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great, great day in terms of equality. It\u2019s really what our Constitution requires and it\u2019s what our country is all about.\n\nThose remarks can be seen in the following video clip:\n\nTrump has been criticized for using inflammatory rhetoric that escalated a growing crisis in Minneapolis, while an outpouring of public anger, protests, and riots consumed that city in the immediate aftermath of Floyd\u2019s death. The official White House Twitter account posted a tweet that threatened \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\u201d Twitter hid the tweet for violating platform rules against glorifying violence. Trump has also been criticized for his threats to send in the U.S. military against protesters.\n\nBecause Trump did indeed make the comment about Floyd in question, we rate this claim \u201cCorrect attribution.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
