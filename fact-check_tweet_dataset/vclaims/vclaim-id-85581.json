Reporters have unsuccessfully tried to clarify Trump\u2019s position on the issue since he became president. When asked if Harvey and Irma may have altered his views, Trump dismissed the idea, claiming \u201cWe\u2019ve had bigger storms than this,\u201d referring to storms in the 1930s and 1940s as well as the teens.\n\nThe Fact Checker takes no position on whether human activity plays a role in climate change, so we won\u2019t wander into murky waters and attempt to address a link between Harvey and Irma and climate change. But we thought it prudent to examine Trump\u2019s dismissal on the grounds there were \u201cbigger storms\u201d in the past. Hurricanes are rated on a scale, and their damage is measured in terms of dollars, which means there is plenty of data to compare storms and possibly assess the president\u2019s claim.\n\nWhen asked for Trump\u2019s source of data, White House officials pointed to a 2011 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The report ranks the deadliest, costliest and most intense tropical cyclones in the United States between 1851 and 2010. It is important to point out that from 2006 to 2014, no major hurricanes made landfall in the United States. However, in 2012, Hurricane Sandy, a post-tropical cyclone, struck New York and New Jersey, causing major damage.\n\nHow do these storms compare to Hurricane Irma and Harvey? Both Irma and Harvey were more intense with respect to pressure than the 1947 Hurricane. Irma ranks as the seventh-most intense hurricane, eclipsing the 1915 storm and coming in two points shy of the 1919 storm. The 1935 hurricane still claims the top spot. The table below is adapted from the NOAA report to include Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma.\n\nThe report also ranks the hurricanes with respect to the cost of the damage inflicted \u2014 and the intensity of the storm doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into more damage. The NOAA report points out that a large portion of the damage caused by the top 30 costliest hurricanes was the result of inland flooding from heavy rains. As sea levels rise, the storm surges generated by hurricanes move farther and farther inland, resulting in more flooding along the coast.\n\nIn the case of Hurricane Harvey, the storm triggered what scientists call a 1,000-year flood, meaning in any given year there is a 0.1 percent change a flood of this scale will happen. Once the storm finally subsided on Sept. 2, it was estimated to have dropped 33 trillion gallons of water on Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee and Kentucky. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina, one of the costliest storms to date, left 80 percent of New Orleans underwater after the storm surge broke through the city\u2019s levees.\n\nAdditionally, the NOAA report notes that development along the U.S. coastline also paves the way for more damage. A 2013 report from NOAA showed a 39 percent increase from 1970 to 2010 in the number of people living along the coast. During that same period, the total U.S. population increased 52 percent. As of 2010, 39 percent of the U.S. population lives in a shoreline county. By 2020, 10 million more people are projected to move to the coast.\n\nThe NOAA report notes that due to coastal growth and inflation, every future major hurricane, and even weaker tropical storms will almost certainly replace the current costliest hurricanes. In support of the prediction, the report highlights the fact that, \u201call three of the U.S. hurricane landfalls in 2008 made the top 30 list despite none of them being major hurricanes at landfall.\u201d\n\nWe thought it was odd the president chose to focus on barometric pressure instead of the economic costs of hurricanes. After all, the federal government is on the hook for covering much of the cost of the damage from these major storms, and Hurricane Harvey\u2019s impact is projected to slow the growth of the nation\u2019s GDP. While the government can\u2019t regulate the pressure of a hurricane forming off the coast of the United States, it can create policies governing development in the nation\u2019s coastal areas or in flood zones, which could help to mitigate the devastation of future storms.\n\nTrump\u2019s response that \u201cwe\u2019ve had bigger storms\u201d is factual to a degree but does not address the economic costs of these major storms or the toll they take on people living in coastal areas. Furthermore, the intensity of a storm does not necessarily correlate to the amount of damage it can cause. Much of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, one of the most expensive hurricanes to date, was the result of high storm surges and flooding when water broke through the city\u2019s levees. The losses from Hurricane Harvey, which are estimated to reach as high as $190 billion, were also the result of heavy rainfall and flooding. As sea levels rise and more people move to the coast, the damage from major hurricanes will only increase.", "lang": "en"}
