His tweet drew over 5,000 likes and more than 900 retweets.\n\nSame letter shared by Shashi Tharoor in 2018\n\n\u201cFor all those smarting from rejection: those in power today (&in a position to judge you) will not necessarily be proven right tomorrow. And their judgement of you might look downright silly\u2026.\u201d tweeted Shashi Tharoor on June 11, referring to a letter of rejection from the University of Bern to scientist Albert Einstein for his unsuccessful doctoral application and ineligibility for the position of associate professor at the university.\n\nAccording to the article by American fact-checking outlet Snopes, Einstein\u2019s initial doctoral application, deemed insufficient, was indeed rejected along with a denial of the position of associate professor by the University of Bern in 1907. However, the viral letter is a modern fabrication and NOT the actual letter sent to Einstein.\n\nSnopes pointed out, \u201cThe University of Bern, a school located in a country (Switzerland) where the predominant language was German, would not have sent the German-speaking Einstein, who published his academic work in German, a letter written in English.\u201d Furthermore, the letter references the modern postal code for Bern (3012) but Switzerland didn\u2019t adopt their four-digit postal code system until the 1960s.\n\nAfter his faux pas was called out, Tharoor acknowledged his faux pas.\n\nIn an age of information overload, it is often difficult to sift fiction from fact, but a simple Google search by Tharoor would have saved him the embarrassment of tweeting a forged letter.\n\n[This article was updated on September 18, 2020.]", "lang": "en"}
