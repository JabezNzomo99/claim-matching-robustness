The claim is false; the photo shows Anies and other participants of the 2019 World Cities Summit Mayors Forum (WCSMF) in Colombia; the forum did not select anyone as \u201cthe best governor\u201d.\n\nThis photo has been shared more than 400 times since posted on Facebook on January 17, 2020.\n\nIt shows a group photo with Anies marked in the front row by a blue circle and a blue arrow pointing to him.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Indonesian-language text across the top of the photo translates to English as: \u201cDR. Anies Rasyid Baswedan is named as the world \u2019s best governor. Indonesian people should be proud there is still a great leader in Indonesia.\u201d\n\nThe same image has been shared here, here and here on Facebook and here and here on Twitter.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found that the photo was tweeted on July 11, 2019 by the Agency for Cooperation and Investment of Medellin and the Metropolitan Area (ACI Medellin). The organisation describes itself as \u201can entity of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Medellin,\" which is the Colombian city that hosted the WCSMF event.\n\nThe tweet says: \u201cDuring the first session of #WCSMF, the mayors from all around (globe emoji) discussed how to strengthen social and institutional trust, the challenges they have faced in their cities and how the public, private and academic sectors have articulated to solve social problems #WCSMF2019\u201d.\n\nBelow is a comparison screenshot of the picture in the misleading post (L) and the original photo (R):\n\nThe World Cities Summit Mayors Forum is an annual event for world mayors and city leaders to discuss challenges and best practices in urban management, according to its Singaporean-based organiser, the World Cities Summit.\n\nThe 2019 forum was held from July 10 to July 12, according to the summary of its program here. Anies was one of the speakers in the forum, as shown by this World Cities Summit tweet on July 13, 2019.\n\nApart from Anies, other Indonesian city leaders, such as Jambi Mayor Syarif Fasha and Bontang Mayor Neni Moerniaeni, were also among the 54 mayors and city leaders invited to Medellin.\n\nHowever, there is no mention of \u201cbest governor award\u201d or anything similar in the World Cities Summit\u2019s Facebook, Twitter and YouTube accounts.", "lang": "en"}
