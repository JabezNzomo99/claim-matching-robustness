Share your views with us in the comment section!\n\nThe archived version of the post is saved here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War room ( AFWA) found this to be a misleading post. This incident has nothing to do with Telangana. The particular incident happened in Pretoria of South Africa two years back. The image of the man used in the viral post is also related to a different incident.\n\nWith the help of a keyword search, we found a similar incident that happened in 2017 in Pretoria, South Africa. International media like The Sun reported the incident during that time. The headline reads GANG RAPE HORROR Three women raped man, 23, for THREE days\u2019 after kidnapping man in a taxi and force-feeding him energy drinks in South Africa..\n\nThis was also reported by the Indian media like India Today.\n\nWith the help of a reverse image search, we found that the image used on the viral post is also misleading. The image is of a man from Pune, who killed 14 members of his family before committing suicide. The incident happened three years back and was widely covered by the media.\n\nWe could not find any such incident of a man being raped by three women for three days in Telangana, in any mainstream media. Hence, it is clear that the viral post is misleading. The incident happened in South Africa and the image is also not related to this incident.\n\nAlso read: Fact check: No, lawyers are not exempted at Toll plazas on the national highways", "lang": "en"}
