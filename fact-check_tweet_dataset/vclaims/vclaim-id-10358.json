No, Ferrell is not dead, the story is not true. While he was actually in a car crash he escaped with minor injuries. The hoax about his death was spread by a known fake news website that is part of a larger network of such sites.\n\nThe untrue story about his death was published in an article on April 15, 2018 by a site using the domain breaking-cnn.com (which is not affiliated with the real CNN) which was titled \"Will Ferrell dies after a two-car crash - #GoldCoast2018\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nActor and comedian Will Ferrell has died in the wee hours of Saturday morning few hours after being hospitalized. Ferrell was rushed to the hospital Thursday night after he was involved in a serious two-car crash in southern California. The crash happened on Interstate 5 and caused the SUV that Ferrell was riding in to flip over, TMZ reported. Ferrell was one of three passengers in the SUV, and all were taken to a hospital, according to the celebrity news site. One of the two remaining injured passengers is reported to be in a critical condition. It was unclear what caused the crash. The California Highway Patrol did not immediately respond to requests Friday for more information.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail might have though it was a real news article and the #GoldCoast2018 hashtag could have caused it to be seen by many who were following the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games:\n\nBut it has been widely reported that Ferrell was just fine after the crash:\n\nThe site breaking-cnn.com appears to be part of a network of fake news websites that all have normal looking front pages with some generic news stories taken from other websites but which frequently publish hoax articles on other parts of the site that aren't immediately obvious to visitors. These stories frequently are death hoaxes about celebrities or other well known people that have been reported as being in the hospital by mainstream news sources. Some sites we've identified as part of the network include:\n\nThis site shares the IP address 23.229.190.72 with at least eight other sites in the network.\n\nWe wrote a longer expos\u00e9 about that network here if you are interested in reading more about the kinds of tricks and tactics used by this network.\n\u2022 Fake News: Caster Semenya NOT Fighting For Her Life After Snake Bite\n\u2022 Fake News: George Brooks Veikoso Did NOT Die From Injuries Sustained During Show\n\u2022 Fake News: Marilyn Manson Did NOT Die From Injuries Sustained during Show", "lang": "en"}
