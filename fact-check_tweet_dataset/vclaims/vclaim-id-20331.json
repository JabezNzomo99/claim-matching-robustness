Following an inquest into the fire the coroner made a number of recommendations to the government and to other organisations like the London Fire Brigade and Southwark Council for how similar fires could be avoided in the future.\n\nThe recommendations made to the government in 2013 included:\n\u2022 Publishing \u201cconsolidated national guidance in relation to the \u201cstay put\u201d principle and its interaction with the \u201cget out and stay out\u201d policy, including how such guidance is disseminated to residents.\u201d\n\u2022 Reviewing the guidance on risk assessment for fighting fires in high rises;\n\u2022 Providing clear guidance on the inspection of flats in high rise buildings;\n\u2022 Encouraging housing providers to retro-fit sprinkler systems in high rise buildings, and;\n\u2022 Reviewing Document B (fire safety) of the Building Regulations to ensure that it is easily understandable and give guidance to those who are responsible for maintaining tower blocks as well as building them.\n\nIt is this last point that the newspaper reports were referring to in particular.\n\nIn its response to the coroner\u2019s letter the government said it had \u201ccommissioned research which will feed into a future review of this part of the Building Regulations. We expect this work to form the basis of a formal review leading to the publication of a new edition of the Approved Document in 2016/17.\u201d\n\nThis government says the work is still ongoing.\n\nAll buildings newly constructed or refurbished must comply with the 2010 building regulations. The fire safety element of these regulations (Document B) was produced in 2006 and amended in 2010 and 2013.\n\nLandlords and building owners are responsible for fire safety in the communal areas of apartment blocks. They have \u201ca duty to ensure that a risk assessment is carried out to identify hazards and risks, and remove and reduce these as far as possible.\u201d\n\nWhat has the government said about reviewing fire safety regulations since?\n\nIn 2015 a government minister in the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) was asked about reviewing fire safety regulations and said:\n\n\u201cFollowing the Lakanal house fire, to which my hon. Friend referred, the coroner called on the Government to simplify the guidance in approved document B of the building regulations. My Department\u2019s Secretary of State committed to a review, which will deliver a revised document in 2016/17; the intention is to simplify the guidance where possible and update and revise the technical content at the same time.\u201d\n\nThat document has not been revised yet.\n\nIn October last year Gavin Barwell, who at the time was Minister for Housing and Planning, said \u201cWe have not set out any formal plans to review the building regulations as a whole, but we have publicly committed ourselves to reviewing part B following the Lakanal House fire.\u201d\n\nIn February this year the Minister for Policing and the Fire Service (at the time), Brandon Lewis, said that a statement about changes to fire safety regulations would be made \u201cin due course\u201d, in response to a question about progress on revising the regulations.\n\nThat same month the government published research into how usable the current fire safety regulations are, including Document B (on fire safety). It said the study was \u201cnot about their technical content nor the underlying policy decisions which determine the guidance given.\u201d This was focused on who used the documents, what they used them for, and how the documents could best present information to these different groups.\n\nThe research concluded that the documents \u201cdeal with complex information and do not present it in a way that is clear to all\u201d, recommending for example that the documents should provide more prescriptive guidance to avoid the need for interpretation.\n\nDocument B hasn\u2019t yet been updated following this research and nothing has been published looking into the technical content of the fire safety regulations.\n\nWhen asked about the review following the fire at Grenfell Tower the government is reported to have said \"this work is ongoing \u2013 including with the publication of a survey in February this year \u2013 as our priority is to make sure we have the highest possible standards. The Coroner also asked Government to write to councils encouraging them to consider retro-fitting sprinklers, which we did shortly after.\"\n\nIt also said that:\n\n\u201cThe final recommendation [by the coroner] concerned simplification of fire safety guidance, and this work was under way, with a consultation due to be published this summer.\n\n\u201cFire safety requirements are complex issues and our priority has been that we have high standards. A great deal of work has been completed, including commissioning and undertaking research to support the planned consultation. Clearly, in light of this tragic event, we need to reflect on whether this consultation is the correct next step to take. We will confirm our approach shortly.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the DCLG for further information on the steps it has taken to progress the review and more generally on fire safety in the past few years.\n\nThe All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety Rescue Group also called for a review\n\nRonnie King, the honorary administrative secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety Rescue Group, has said \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s [the government] done nothing but it\u2019s certainly not reviewed the fire aspects of the building regulations, which is critical.\u201d\n\nThe All-Party Group also reportedly called for a review of the fire safety elements of the building regulations.\n\nThe BBC reports that leaked letters from the All-Party Group to the government show that it repeatedly warned four different housing ministers that action needed to be taken on fire safety regulations.\n\nOne of the letters to the government says:\n\n\u201cSurely however when you already have credible evidence in 2012 to justify updating a small but important part of the guidance in the Approved Document, which will lead to saving of lives, you don\u2019t need to wait another three years in addition to the two already spent since the research findings were updated, in order to take action?", "lang": "en"}
