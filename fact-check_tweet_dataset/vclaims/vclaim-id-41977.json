In accordance with an Indian Supreme Court ruling barring the naming of rape victims, AFP has redacted the woman's name.\n\nThe caption says: \"This is [victim's name] rapist Pasha. He is an animal. Cannot understand what the Hyderabad police are doing with him. Are they beating him at all or giving him a massage.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post, with the victim's name redacted from the caption:\n\nPolice said in a televised press briefing December 6, 2019, available on the YouTube channel of Indian news agency ANI here, that they had arrested four men over the attack.\n\nCyberabad Police Commissioner VC Sajjanar names the four suspects from the 57 second mark.\n\n\"All these four accused are Mohammed Arif, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen and Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu,\" he said.\n\nA copy of the police remand report obtained by AFP shows the same names for the four suspects.

It will not reduce your anger but your mind will be a bit relaxed,\" the post said.\n\nAll the claims are false -- the video had circulated online for at least 24 hours prior to the Hyderabad attack and shows police and local residents beating a man accused of raping a 10-year-old girl on November 23 in Chittoor, a district in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nVery similar video to that used in the misleading posts was published here on YouTube in local Telugu language report uploaded November 26 -- one day before the rape-murder in Hyderabad.\n\n\u201cExclusive Visuals: Police beat an accused of raping a ten-year-old girl| Chittoor| NTV,\u201d the video\u2019s Telugu-language caption says.\n\nBelow are comparison screenshots of the video shared the misleading Facebook post (L) and the video seen in the news report (R):\n\nReverse image searches on Google using keyframes from the misleading video obtained with InVID, a digital verification tool, led to this report published on November 27 by The Hindu, a daily newspaper in India.\n\n\u201cAccused in rape case thrashed by cops, public in Chittoor,\u201d reads the headline, above a screenshot taken from the footage of the incident.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nAFP also obtained a copy of the police complaint from a local journalist in Chittoor, Hrudaya Vihari, on December 5.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the complaint with details that the identity of the victim redacted:\n\nThe police complaint states that the alleged perpetrator \u201ccommitted sexual assault\u201d on a 10-year-old girl in the village of Kotala and was charged with rape.\n\nLocal police chief, E.
