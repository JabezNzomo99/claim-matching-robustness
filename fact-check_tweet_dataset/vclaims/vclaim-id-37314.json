The original photo was taken at Halloween in 2016.\n\n\u201cAfter meeting thousands of Syrian Refugees and learning more about their faith, I have learned to love Islam. Islam promotes peace and is in fact more peaceful than Christianity. Islam is the religion that I identify with.\u201d\n\nThis quote was attributed to Trudeau, and shared several thousand times on social media since August 29. It was illustrated by a headshot of the prime minister donning a white head garb reminiscent of a keffiyeh.\n\nThe first iteration of this picture and text together appeared on a Facebook page \u201cJustin Trudeau Not\u201d on August 29. It then migrated to Twitter the next day and was widely shared for the following week.\n\nThe quote most likely originated from an August 28, 2016 article from the Vatican Enquirer, a news website that claims to take a \u201csatirical look at headlines around the world\u201d. However, most articles on the website show no obvious signs of satire and the disclaimer is not accessible from the front page, leaving many people to share the news as true. This particular article was shared nearly 8,000 times according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.\n\nThe article claims that the quote came from the Global Sun, another news website which no longer exists. The quote in the Vatican Enquirer article and in the more recent meme posts are almost identical.\n\nTrudeau is said to have announced his conversion to Islam on August 26, 2016. On that day, the prime minister was in Saguenay, a city in the province of Qu\u00e9bec, for the National Caucus summer meeting of the Liberal party, as his official itinerary shows.\n\nHe did hold a press conference that day, but did not make any mention of Islam. Later that day, a video was released of Trudeau advertising Muslim Fest, an annual two-day festival in Mississauga, Ontario, that celebrates Muslim artists, musicians and comedians. Trudeau did not utter the words attributed to him in that video either.\n\nThe close-up photo of the prime minister was taken on October 31, 2016, while Trudeau was out trick-or-treating with his son for Halloween. Hadrien Trudeau was dressed as The Little Prince, a fictional character from Antoine de Saint-Exupery\u2019s eponymous novel, while the prime minister was dressed as the airplane pilot from the same story.\n\nHow we did it\n\nThe original photo was flipped in order to make it invisible to a reverse image search, a common practice by someone who intends to use a photo out of context. After an AFP journalist recognized the photo, we flipped the photo back in order to confirm its origin.", "lang": "en"}
