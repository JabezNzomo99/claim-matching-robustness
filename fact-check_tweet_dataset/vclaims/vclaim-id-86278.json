They said the assertion was based on \u201cthe lack of cohesive collection and reporting of abortion complications across all states, eyewitness accounts of emergency responses at abortion facilities, FDA reports on abortion pill deaths and thousands of serious adverse effects reported through 2016, and the fact that illegal self-managed abortions are being promoted openly and offered to women even after the FDA warned that this can be dangerous.\u201d\n\nBy the 1950s, antibiotics such as penicillin and improved methods of contraception helped to curb the mortality rate, which continued to fall in the 1960s, after states loosened restrictions. By 1965, the National Center for Health Statistics reported 235 deaths from abortion. Although reporting had improved by that time, a leading researcher wrote, \u201cTotal mortality from illegal abortions was undoubtedly larger than that figure, but in all likelihood it was under 1,000.\u201d By 1972, the year before Roe v. Wade, official reports said fewer than 100 women died as a result of abortions \u2014 legal or illegal.\n\nLate-term abortion is not a medical term, but a colloquial and political one. It generally refers to abortions that happen after 20 weeks, or about halfway through pregnancy. In 2015, 638,169 \u201clegal induced abortions were reported to CDC from 49 reporting areas.\u201d The vast majority, 91.1 percent or about 580,000, were preformed at or before 13 weeks of gestation. But 1.3 percent of those (or a little more than 8,000) abortions took place at or after 21 weeks.\n\nCDC told us via email it does not collect \u201cmore granular data [on abortions] after 21 weeks because the numbers are tiny.\u201d In other words, there is no clear data on whether most abortions after 21 weeks happen before or after the point of fetal viability. (As we\u2019ve previously reported, viability differs from pregnancy to pregnancy, though the gestational age of viability is generally pegged at 24 to 28 weeks. Some, however, have argued that viability can be as soon as 22 weeks.)", "lang": "en"}
