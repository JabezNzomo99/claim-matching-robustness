The NASCAR statement issued that day didn\u2019t say that. Two days later, the FBI said Wallace was not the victim of a hate crime because the noose had been in that garage before it was assigned to him. NASCAR said it was a \u201cgarage door pull fashioned like a noose.\u201d\n\nA Facebook post inaccurately claims that the noose found in the garage of NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace was an automotive belt, and falsely blames Wallace for mistaking it for a noose.\n\nWallace \u2014 the \u201conly fulltime Black driver in NASCAR\u2019s elite Cup Series,\u201d according to the Associated Press \u2014 has faced threats in light of the organization\u2019s recent decision to ban Confederate flags at its events. In a June 8 interview on CNN, Wallace called on NASCAR to ban the flags, and two days later the racing organization announced that \u201cdisplay of the confederate flag will be prohibited from all NASCAR events.\u201d\n\nOn June 21, NASCAR announced the discovery of a noose hanging in Wallace\u2019s garage, calling it a \u201cheinous act\u201d and promising an \u201cimmediate investigation.\u201d\n\nNASCAR, June 21: Late this afternoon, NASCAR was made aware that a noose was found in the garage stall of the 43 team. We are angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we take this heinous act. We have launched an immediate investigation, and will do everything we can to identify the person(s) responsible and eliminate them from the sport. As we have stated unequivocally, there is no place for racism in NASCAR, and this act only strengthens our resolve to make the sport open and welcoming to all.\n\nThe Facebook post altered that statement to falsely claim that the investigation \u201cdetermined Bubba Wallace had mistaken a 26\u2033 serpentine automotive belt for a noose.\u201d The bogus post poses as a news story with a dateline from Talladega, Alabama, and claims the NASCAR statement on the conclusion of the investigation was issued June 21.", "lang": "en"}
