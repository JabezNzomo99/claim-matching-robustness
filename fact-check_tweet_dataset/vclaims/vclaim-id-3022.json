In dozens of speeches since, the president largely has stuck to two specific claims about his deregulation record. Neither is true, according to analysts who study regulations and former federal workers who have administered them. \u201cWe\u2019ve eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration has ever eliminated. And that means four years, eight years, or, in one instance, 16 years.\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump, at a Feb. 1 Republican retreat. \u201cI pledged to eliminate two unnecessary regulations for every one new regulation. We have succeeded beyond our highest expectations. Instead of 2 for 1, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every one new rule.\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump, on Jan. 26, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The Trump administration has engaged in a sleight of hand to create the 22-1 ratio. And while Mr. Trump has made progress in his deregulatory agenda, his claims of achieving more success in one year than throughout the entire presidencies of any of his predecessors is hyperbole, not fact.\n\nMr. Trump demanded the so-called \u201c2-for-1 rule\u201d in one of his first executive orders. He claims that it has been so successful that the federal government has actually eliminated 22 regulations for every one enacted. A White House fact sheet from December declared that the Trump administration had \u201cissued 67 deregulatory actions while imposing only three new regulatory actions.\u201d To back up its claim, the fact sheet cited a chart published by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs that described each of the actions. But the chart \u2014 which the federal Regulatory Information Service Center says has never been compiled during earlier presidencies \u2014 raises more questions than it answers. For example: \u25a0 A database that is maintained by the White House regulatory affairs office outlines 34 \u201cderegulatory\u201d actions, compared to 67 in the chart. The White House did not respond to repeated inquiries to explain the discrepancy. \u25a0 Some items labeled \u201cderegulatory action\u201d clearly involve some regulation as well. For instance, one \u201cderegulatory action\u201d lifts a ban on imports of pitahaya, or dragon fruit, from Ecuador. But it also subjects the imports to new inspections requirements. Other actions are temporary, like the dismissal of a century-old shipping law to help hurricane aid efforts in Puerto Rico. Doing so was labeled a \u201cderegulatory action,\u201d although it only lasted 10 days and Mr. Trump declined to fully or permanently renew it. \u25a0 Not all actions are created equal. Three actions designated as \u201cregulatory\u201d were described as economically significant \u2014 meaning that they have an impact of $100 million or more. Only two \u201cderegulatory\u201d actions were considered economically significant. \u25a0 Of the 65 other \u201cderegulatory actions\u201d on the chart, 60 percent were either routine, administrative or otherwise not significant. About one-third of those efforts to roll back regulations began under President Barack Obama. And 10 do not appear to be rules \u2014 they are advisory notices or guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget. \u201cThe 22-1 ratio needs to be taken with a grain of salt,\u201d said Susan Dudley, the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under President George W. Bush. Trying to Claim the Deregulation Crown, Inaccurately\n\nMr. Trump later compared the deregulatory actions in his first year in office to all of those taken during the full \u201cfour years, eight years, or, in one instance, 16 years\u201d in all previous presidential administrations. No American president has served for 16 years; Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to four presidential terms but only served for 12 years before dying in office. Beyond that, comparing regulatory activity across administrations is an imperfect exercise. Standards for making and revoking rules are frequently changing, and courts and Congress can tweak and review them as well. But available metrics indicate that Mr. Trump is wrong to claim he has already stopped or eliminated more federal rules than any other president. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs says it withdrew 635 rules in 2017 \u2014 a fast pace over a one-year period by any measure. But that is not more than any previous presidency \u2014 Mr. Obama withdrew 1,814 federal rules during his eight-year term and Mr. Bush eliminated 2,813 while in office. The Program for Economic Research on Regulation, at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., combs the Federal Register to quantify the number of rule-making actions by regulatory agencies. University researchers found that federal regulations actually grew by about 0.65 percent during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office. They also noted that the rate of growth was slower than what it was annually from 1970 to 2016, when it averaged about 2.1 percent. Experts said that Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to cut through the bureaucracy fall far short of the structural changes made under Ronald Reagan, who abolished entire regulatory agencies and eliminated some economic regulations in the transportation, telecommunications and energy industries. \u201cNothing Trump has done to date compares to that in terms of impact on Americans,\u201d Ms. Dudley said.\n\nCary Coglianese, the director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that \u201ca lot of the key institutions\u2019 processes that we have today, dealing with regulation, were established by Reagan.\u201d He pointed to the 1981 enactment of cost-benefit analyses and legal challenges to Mr. Reagan\u2019s deregulation policies that set current standards for administrative law, which govern how federal, state and local agencies operate. Mr. Trump\u2019s hyperbole not withstanding, he can claim some deregulatory successes. Previous reports in The New York Times have detailed the Trump administration\u2019s lax enforcement of certain rules across several agencies. Early in his administration, Mr. Trump rolled back Obama-era rules though an unprecedented use of the 1996 Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to \u201cdisapprove\u201d regulations issued within 90 days with the help of the president. Dan Goldbeck of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit conservative group that promotes smaller government, said he sees a more concerted effort to streamline and trim back regulations under Mr. Trump than under many previous administrations. The pace of consideration for significant regulations also has slowed. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reviewed 60 rules that were described as economically significant between Jan. 21, 2017, to Jan. 20, 2018. The last time so few federal rules were reviewed in one-year was 1984, under Mr. Reagan. The federal regulatory system will continue to evolve throughout \u2014 and beyond \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s time in office. So will his own approach, experts said. So far in the 2018 fiscal year, the administration has shifted its deregulation efforts toward making substantive changes through the regular rule-making process, Mr. Goldbeck said. As evidence, he pointed to a new rule to amend the federal meat inspection process that the Department of Agriculture estimates could save millions of dollars annually, according to a department estimate. \u201cBut expect to see a delay\u201d in how much fruit these efforts will bear Mr. Goldbeck said. \u201cThat\u2019s just nature of the process.\u201d And Mr. Trump has reversed at least one of his own decisions, backtracking on his waiver to regulate state government drug-testing rules.\n\nAdditionally, there is no guarantee that regulations that have been waived will survive legal challenges, nor that they will remain in place in future presidential administrations. Once agencies complete the rule-making process, Ms. Dudley said, \u201cthey will likely have to defend their deregulatory action in court, where they may or may not succeed.\u201d Congress also could later decide to reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cRegulatory change is not forever. They\u2019re not like diamonds,\u201d Mr. Coglianese said.", "lang": "en"}
