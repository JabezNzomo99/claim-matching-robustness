They call it crumbs. They talk about a dark cloud. And they are promising to take it all away.\n\n1. To back Ryan\u2019s statement, his campaign staff cited an April 2018 website posting about Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House. It carried this headline: \"Pelosi: Democrats Will Repeal the GOP Tax Law When We Retake the House.\"\n\nBut in the video clip that accompanies the article, Pelosi wasn\u2019t that explicit.\n\nPelosi had been asked at a town hall meeting if Democrats win control of the House in the November 2018 elections, \"will you rewrite the tax bill from scratch, or focus on reversing specific components?\" She replied:\n\nWe\u2019ll sit down at the table and say, What would be a tax bill that creates growth, that creates good-paying jobs, as it reduces the deficit?...We can do that, we must do that, in a bipartisan way. It\u2019s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it\u2019s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future.\n\nSo, Pelosi said she would be willing to work with Republicans on overhauling, or overturning the law, in an unspecified way.\n\n2. Two months earlier, Pelosi did use the word repeal in speaking about Democrats retaking control of the House. But she appeared to be joking, and also spoke of a bipartisan effort.\n\nShe was asked at a news conference: \"You spoke earlier this week about how, if Democrats take back Congress, that you would want to work on a fair tax system. Tell us a little bit more about what you mean. Is that basically like a repeal and replace of the new tax law?\"\n\nWell, it may have to be a replace and repeal (chuckles). Replace them (Republicans) and repeal the bill. No, (Rep. Joe Crowley) and Congresswoman Sanchez, they\u2019re on the Ways and Means Committee and I\u2019m going to defer to them on this. But we\u2019ve always said, you can\u2019t do this tax bill without having it being bipartisan. We want to recognize that perhaps we should lower the corporate rate; maybe that\u2019s so, maybe not, what\u2019s the case for it. But if you\u2019re going to have sustainability in a tax reform, it has to be bipartisan.\n\n3. Pelosi\u2019s office, responding to Ryan\u2019s claim, cited a Pelosi statement from a March 2018 news conference as being representative of what she has said on the subject.\n\nAfter repeatedly calling the GOP reform a \"tax scam\" for helping the rich more than the middle class, she said:\n\nWe would have bipartisan, open hearings on how we go forward. What\u2019s the appropriate level of a corporate tax cut? How do we first and foremost empower financially the middle class and make that permanent, not treat them as second class people in our country? Because we said for corporations it\u2019s a permanent tax cut, for people it\u2019s not permanent. And, again, it would be unifying. Unifying. It would be bipartisan, open, transparent, and unifying as we go forward to strengthen middle class tax cuts and to do so in a way that creates good paying jobs, promotes growth and reduces the deficit.\n\nSo, Pelosi has talked about a comprehensive review of taxes and alluded to repealing the GOP tax reform law.\n\nBut she has also talked about a corporate tax rate lower than what it was before the reform, and about maintaining tax breaks for the middle class.\n\nWe also reviewed the statements of the Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\n1. At a March 2018 news conference about Democrats\u2019 proposals for infrastructure projects, Schumer spoke about reversing only certain GOP tax reforms, saying:\n\nRather than cutting existing infrastructure projects to pay for a paltry program, we want to roll back the Republican tax giveaways to big corporations and the wealthy, and invest that money instead in job-creating infrastructure.\n\n2. Schumer had gone further shortly after the tax bill\u2019s passage, telling reporters, according to The Hill:\n\nThere are probably a small number of provisions we might not repeal. It certainly would need drastic overhaul aiming it at the middle class, not the wealthy and powerful.\n\n3. But Schumer\u2019s office told us Democrats only want to roll back provisions for the wealthy and some of those for corporations -- but leave intact tax cuts for workers and the middle class.\n\nA summary of the Democrats\u2019 infrastructure proposal would, among other things, restore the top individual tax rate and the estate tax to what they were before the GOP tax reform law, and put the corporate tax rate at 25 percent, up from 21 percent under the GOP law.\n\nSchumer emphasized the GOP tax cuts for the rich in saying about the Democratic alternative:\n\nWe want to roll back the Republican tax giveaways to big corporations and the wealthy and invest that money instead in job-creating infrastructure.\n\nSo, like Pelosi, Schumer has spoken about resetting the corporate tax rate to lower than it had been before the GOP reform law, but higher than where the reform law put it. Schumer\u2019s emphasis has been on reversing tax breaks for the rich, not for scrapping the entire reform law.\n\nRyan\u2019s office also pointed out \"tax day\" remarks by U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. He didn\u2019t threaten repeal of the GOP tax reform, but called on Republicans to do so, saying:\n\nThe Republican caucus needs to announce that it will repeal and replace this bill. This is the bill that needs to be repealed and replaced. They are focused on health care. Repeal this bill, my Republican colleagues.\n\nRyan says that on the tax reform law, Democratic leaders \"are promising to take it all away.\"\n\nDemocratic leaders in Congress have been harshly critical of the law, and have talked about the need to repeal or at least review most of it. But the tax reform law also provides tax benefits to the middle class, which the Democratic leaders have indicated they want to keep.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.", "lang": "en"}
