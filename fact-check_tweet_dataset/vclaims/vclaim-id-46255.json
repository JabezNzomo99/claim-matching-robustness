Some Facebook and Twitter users have shared the video suggesting, \u201cBrazilian television channels showed Prime Minister Modi\u2019s speech in his country, and Brasilians did it last night itself.

Doing so we found that the viral video was posted on Facebook page Name Above All Names on 28 March 2020. As per the description, the video shows people praying to Jesus in Brazil.\n\nFacebook page Brazil Pera Christ also posted this video on March 27. Since PM Modi had made the \u20189PM-9minute\u2019 announcement on April 3, the video cannot represent an event that took place as a reaction to his speech. Therefore, while Alt News was unable to independently verify where the video was shot, it certainly does not show Brazilians joining India using the flashlights of their cellphones as per PM Modi\u2019s appeal.", "lang": "en"}
