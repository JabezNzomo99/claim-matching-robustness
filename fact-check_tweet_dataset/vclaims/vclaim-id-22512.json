The tweet was itself in response to an inaccurate claim made by the leader of the Scottish Labour party. The information in the SNP's tweet is factually correct, but it\u2019s reported in a misleading way.\n\nThe SNP has been in power in Scotland for longer than Labour (which was in coalition with the Liberal Democrats). It\u2019s been in government for 11 years, from 2007 to present, compared with eight years for Labour and the Lib Dems between 1999 and 2007. So, it makes sense to look at the average number built each year, rather than the total number of homes for social rent built under each government.\n\nSocial housing is owned and managed by councils and housing associations. It\u2019s designed to be affordable and allocated according to need.\n\nThe best estimate we can make is that the average number of social homes started (not completed), has been around 4,800 a year under the SNP, and was around 4,600 under the Labour-Lib Dem coalition. This only includes new-build homes, not those that were bought up or renovated, and may include some homes that are for purchase.\n\nThe SNP is looking at figures on completed social rented homes delivered as part of the \u201caffordable housing supply\u201d.\n\nIt found that since the start of 2007/08 around 52,600 homes for social rent have been completed, compared to around 29,000 between 2000/01 and 2006/07. That works out at about 4,800 homes per year under the SNP, compared to 4,100 per year under the Labour-Lib Dem coalition (there\u2019s no data covering their first year, 1999/2000). However, this data only includes social homes that were partially funded by the government, so it\u2019s not the complete picture.\n\nLooking at housing \u201ccompletions\u201d is just one way of counting a government\u2019s record. It gives us an impression of how many homes are being made available on the market, but many of the homes completed early on in the life of a government are likely to have been started under the previous government. The Scottish government says that \u201cDepending on the size of the site, the average time from start to completion of the entire site can range from anywhere between around 1.5 years to 2.75 years.\u201d\n\nWe can also look at housing starts, as this tells us when foundations were laid. But in this case, the data used by the SNP doesn\u2019t go back that far\u2014it only goes to 2009/10 so we can\u2019t make a comparison with the previous government.\n\nThe two party\u2019s records are fairly similar\n\nSeparate data on \u201csocial sector\u201d homes shows that an average of around 4,800 new social homes were started each year under the SNP, compared to around 4,600 per year under the Labour-Lib Dem coalition. Overall, it shows that 37,000 social homes were started in the Labour-Lib Dem years, with around 53,000 started under the SNP up to March 2018.\n\nThis \u201csocial sector\u201d data isn\u2019t a perfect measure either. It only covers \u201cnew build\u201d homes built from scratch\u2014it misses out \u201coff the shelf\u201d homes (social housing providers buy properties from private developers to rent out) and renovated housing. Some of these homes may be available for purchase\u2014 we\u2019re checking with the Scottish government\u2014but generally they are for renting.\n\nThe SNP was originally addressing a claim, made by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, that Labour built 61,000 homes for social rent in Scotland. This is incorrect.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Mr Leonard is referring to the period 1997/98 to 2009/10\u2014when Labour controlled the UK government\u2014during which there were 61,000 new build starts in the social sector in Scotland. But as housing is devolved, the policy on this would have been set by the Scottish government for most of this time. We\u2019ve asked Scottish Labour for more information.\n\nThe council homes number needs more context\n\nWhat about the claim that Labour only built six council homes? This refers to a single year in terms of either starts or completions, not Labour and the Lib-Dem\u2019s entire time in office, which is what all of the SNP\u2019s other figures refer to. It also reflects a different strategy towards providing social housing. Under the Labour-Lib Dem government almost all social homes were developed through housing associations, whereas it has been a mixture of councils and housing associations under the SNP.\n\nSix new-build homes were started by councils in Scotland in 2005/06. Across the Labour-Lib Dem years, 340 new build homes were started by councils. That\u2019s 1% of social sector homes started during that time. Since the SNP have been in government around 11,200 have been started, or around 21% of all social sector home starts.\n\nBut as we outlined above, the overall social housing supply was at broadly similar levels each year under both SNP and Labour.", "lang": "en"}
