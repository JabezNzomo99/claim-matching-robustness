We\u2019ve asked Ms Forbes\u2019s office to check if that was the case.\n\nSince then, the OECD has released updated figures saying that in 2018 the UK is projected to have one of the slowest economic growth rates both in the G20 and amongst a number of other countries outside this group, but not the slowest.\n\nThe OECD projects that the UK\u2019s economy will grow by 1.4% this year and 1.3% next year, that\u2019s once you account for inflation. This is higher than, for example, Japan which is projected to grow 1.2% this year and next year.\n\nThe G20 describes its members as the \u201cworld\u2019s major economies\u201d and includes both developed and developing countries.\n\nWhat you count as a developed country depends on what measure you look at - the World Bank for example, measures a list of \u201chigh income\u201d countries while the UN has a measure for countries with \u201cvery high human development.\u201d Some of these will not be included in the OECD\u2019s data.", "lang": "en"}
