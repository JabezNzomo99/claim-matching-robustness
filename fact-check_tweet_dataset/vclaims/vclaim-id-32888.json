This is an old myth, which has persisted in various forms for many years.\n\nAccording to the post, \u201cit is dangerous to cut an onion and try to use it to cook the next day\u201d because \u201cit becomes highly poisonous for even a single night and creates toxic bacteria which may cause adverse stomach infections because of excess bile secretions and even food poisoning\u201d.\n\nWhen the fact checking website Snopes looked at this claim in 2009, they found a possible origin in a blog written by Sarah McCann under the pen name Zola Gorgon. The blog describes a visit to a mayonnaise factory, where McCann was told that pre-cut onion was allegedly a common source of food poisoning.\n\nThere appears to be no evidence for this, however. Snopes were able to find only one case of food-poisoning linked to bulb onions.\n\nA review of the available scientific research in January 2018 found evidence that \u201conion volatile compounds\u201d released when cut may actually play a role \u201cas antimicrobials that reduce the rate of microbial growth.\u201d\n\nOverall, the review says that \u201ca shelf\u2010life of 10 to 14 d[ays] is normally feasible for fresh\u2010cut onion stored in a refrigerator\u201d. The National Onion Association in the US says onions can be stored safely in a sealed container in a refrigerator for up to seven days after they are cut.", "lang": "en"}
