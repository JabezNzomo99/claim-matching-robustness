{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did NPR Suggest For People To Burn Books Written By White Authors?", "subtitle": "", "author": "checkyourfact.com", "date": "2020-06-19T18:37:37.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-52356", "url": "http://checkyourfact.com/2020/06/19/fact-check-national-public-radio-npr-burn-books-written-white-authors/", "vclaim": "An image shared on Facebook claims National Public Radio (NPR) \u201cwants people to burn books written by \u2018white people.'\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that NPR has advocated for such a thing. The claim appears to stem from a misinterpretation of an NPR article encouraging people to read more literature from non-white authors.\n\nThe Facebook post contains a screen grab of the website Trending Right Wing\u2019s June 9 article that puts up the headline \u201cNPR Wants People to Burn Books Written By \u2018White People.'\u201d The featured image in the article shows masked people gathered something burning on the ground.\n\n\u201cNot only do liberals want to burn down police stations, dollar stores, and upscale shopping malls, they want to torch each and every book written by \u2018white people,'\u201d the article says. \u201cDon\u2019t use coal to heat your home, that\u2019s not green enough. Instead, throw a few Ray Bradbury novels on the fire and you\u2019ll soon be up to a toasty 451 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201d\n\nThe article repeats the phrase \u201cdecolonizing your bookshelf\u201d multiple times, seemingly referencing an NPR story published on June 6, titled \u201cYour Bookshelf May Be Part of the Problem,\u201d that uses a nearly identical expression.\n\nHowever, at no point does the NPR story call for book burning, nor does it suggest people should not read the works of white authors. Instead, it encourages people to examine the contents of their bookshelves and expand their reading to include books written by more diverse authors.\n\n\u201cReading broadly and with intention is how we counter dehumanization and demand visibility, effectively bridging the gap between what we read and how we might live in a more just and equitable society,\u201d wrote Juan Vidal, the author of the piece. \u201cAs a Latino, I\u2019ve had non-Latino friends ask me to recommend Latin American authors and novels. This is fine, and welcomed. But if all I have to offer the curious-minded is literature that comes from people who look like me, speak my language, or come from where I come from, that\u2019s a problem.\n\nA Trending Right Wing spokesperson told The Associated Press that the article \u201ccaricatures\u201d the NPR piece, saying, \u201cThe article makes it quite clear that the \u2018burning\u2019 is not literal.\u201d But that intention does not appear to have come across to all readers. The screen grab being shared on Facebook only shows the headline, which does not accurately describe the contents of the NPR story.\n\n\u201cNPR stands by this piece which encourages people to read more and from a variety of sources, rather than less,\u201d Isabel Lara, executive director of media relations at NPR, told The Associated Press.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
