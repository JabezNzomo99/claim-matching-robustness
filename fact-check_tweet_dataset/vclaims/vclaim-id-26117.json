Alt News was notified by a social media user. Anil Tiwari, founder of the website Uttarpradesh.org pointed out to Alt News that the video is of 2017. The same video can be seen below. It was posted on 20 July 2017 and is a news report by the channel News24, the same network that Manak Gupta works for.\n\nThe incident had occurred on the Allahabad-Varanasi GT road. According to news reports of that time, three Kanwariyas had been injured in an accident after which they went on a rampage, setting a police station on fire and blocking traffic on the highway for hours.\n\nThe same has been clarified by Ghaziabad police via a tweet in which it attached a snapshot of the tweet by Manak Gupta, asking him to refrain from rumour-mongering.\n\nPassing off old videos as new has now become a predictable strategy for purveyors of misinformation on social media. All it takes is to push a particular video or image with a false narrative through accompanying captions and messages. Since the incident of violence by Kanwariyas is a recent event, many social media users are likely to believe that this video too represents a recent occurrence, although it is more than a year old and is not related to the recent acts of vandalism.", "lang": "en"}
