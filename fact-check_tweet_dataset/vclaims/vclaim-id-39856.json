Since then, the president has made a series of inaccurate claims about his phone call with Zelensky, which he calls \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the claims the president has made over the past two days about the phone call and the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which included an accurate account of the phone call:\n\u2022 The president wrongly claimed that Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified that Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky was \u201cvery normal.\u201d Maguire did not characterize the phone call in his testimony before the House intelligence committee.\n\u2022 Trump falsely claimed that a White House-released memo on his July 25 phone call with Zelensky was \u201can exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation \u2026 taken by very talented stenographers.\u201d The memo includes a \u201ccaution\u201d note saying it \u201cis not a verbatim transcript.\u201d\n\u2022 Trump said that \u201cthe whistleblower never saw the conversation\u201d and \u201cwrote something that was total fiction.\u201d The whistleblower said he received \u201ca readout of the call,\u201d and Maguire said the complaint is consistent with a White House memo of the call. (Trump also wrongly denied that Maguire found the two consistent.)\n\u2022 Trump claimed that Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell \u201cput out a statement that said that was the most innocent phone call he\u2019s read.\u201d McConnell said it wasn\u2019t an impeachable offense, but did not describe the call as \u201cinnocent.\u201d\n\u2022 Trump also claimed that Sen. Rick Scott of Florida described the call as \u201ca perfect conversation.\u201d Scott didn\u2019t use those words, but like McConnell he said he didn\u2019t see the call as an impeachable offense.\n\nOn Aug. 12, an anonymous intelligence community official filed a whistleblower complaint accusing the president of \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d The complaint included a description of a July 25 phone call that Trump made to Zelensky, who was elected the president of Ukraine on April 21.\n\nOn the call, \u201cthe President pressured Mr. Zelenskyy to \u2026 initiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden,\u201d and assist a U.S. review of allegations that the \u201cRussian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine,\u201d according to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cmeet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr. [Rudy] Giuliani and Attorney General [William] Barr,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nThat description was confirmed by a memo of the call, which the White House released on Sept. 25.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d the memo says Trump told Zelensky. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThe memo of the call also showed Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cfind out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine\u201d and the 2016 presidential campaign, and urged him to speak with Barr and Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney.\n\nAt a Sept. 26 House intelligence committee hearing, Rep. Joaquin Castro asked Maguire, the acting DNI, if the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is \u201cremarkably consistent\u201d with the memo of the phone call that was released by the White House.\n\n\u201cI would say that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president,\u201d Maguire said.\n\nNevertheless, the president misstated Maguire\u2019s answer when asked about it during an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nMaguire did not say he found the conversation to be \u201cvery normal.\u201d Those words don\u2019t appear in the CQ Transcriptions and C-SPAN transcripts of the hearing that we reviewed. Maguire wasn\u2019t asked directly whether the call was appropriate or not, but he demurred several times when asked if the allegations in the complaint were concerning or illegal.\n\nIn an exchange with Democratic Rep. Denny Heck, Maguire declined to say if soliciting foreign interference in a U.S. election is illegal. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, sir. I don\u2019t mean to be evasive, but I can\u2019t answer,\u201d Maguire said. But in response to a follow-up question, Maguire said outside foreign interference would be \u201cunwanted\u201d and \u201cbad for the nation.\u201d\n\nMaguire repeatedly said the complaint was credible, and that it should be investigated. Asked if \u201csomeone should investigate this,\u201d Maguire noted that he referred the complaint to the Department of Justice. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t [think it should be investigated], I would not have referred it to the Justice Department and to the FBI.\u201d\n\nBut he also said he wouldn\u2019t presume to tell the committee whether it should investigate the president or not, and he wouldn\u2019t tell the president how to conduct foreign policy.\n\nIn response to Democratic Rep. Michael Quigley, who asked if the complaint concerned him, Maguire said: \u201cHow the president of the United States wants to conduct diplomacy is his business, and it\u2019s not whether or not I approve it or disapprove of it. That is the president\u2019s business on how he wants to conduct that, sir.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed on Oct. 2 that the White House-released memo on his July 25 phone call with Zelensky was \u201can exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation \u2026 taken by very talented stenographers.\u201d That\u2019s incorrect. The memo includes a \u201ccaution\u201d note saying it \u201cis not a verbatim transcript.\u201d\n\nThe president made the claim before a bilateral meeting with the president of Finland, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, and then repeated it later on Oct. 2 in a press conference. Trump said, \u201cI had a transcript done by very, very talented people \u2014 word for word, comma for comma. Done by people that do it for a living. We had an exact transcript.\u201d\n\nBut the memo itself leaves no doubt that it is not an \u201cexact transcript.\u201d It is the \u201cnotes and recollections,\u201d it said, of staff \u201cassigned to listen and memorialize the conversation.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the full \u201ccaution\u201d note that appears at the bottom of the first page of the White House\u2019s memo on the phone call:\n\nHow the Memo Compares to the Complaint\n\nTrump has made several claims about the memo refuting the whistleblower complaint, referring, falsely, at one point to the complaint as \u201ctotal fiction.\u201d The White House memo actually corroborates some of the whistleblower\u2019s claims, which the inspector general of the intelligence community deemed an \u201c\u2018urgent concern\u2019 that \u2018appears credible.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn his Oct. 2 press conference, Trump talked about releasing the \u201cexact transcript\u201d (see above) and added, \u201cAnd when we produced that transcript, they died. Because you look at the whistleblower statement, and it\u2019s vicious.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 3, he said, \u201cThe whistleblower never saw the conversation. He got his information, I guess, second and third hand. He wrote something that was total fiction, and now when people see that they\u2019re not happy.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll lay out what the whistleblower and the White House memo said about the July 25 phone call.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint said that \u201c[m]ultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call\u201d said that Trump \u201csought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the President\u2019s 2020 reelection bid.\u201d It said that, according to these officials, Trump \u201cpressured\u201d Zelensky to do three things:\n\u2022 \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden\u201d;\n\u2022 \u201cassist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine, with a specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm Crowdstrike\u201d;\n\u2022 \u201cmeet or speak\u201d about these matters \u201cwith two people\u201d \u2013 Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr \u2013 \u201cto whom the President referred multiple times in tandem.\u201d\n\nTrump denies that he \u201cpressured\u201d Zelensky to do these things. But the White House memo of the call shows he asked for them, with the exception of explicitly asking for the servers to be turned over \u2014 though Trump asks about the DNC server. The memo is unclear on this point.\n\u2022 \u201cThe other thing, [t]here\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d (See: \u201cTrump Twists Facts on Biden and Ukraine.\u201d)\n\u2022 \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation.\u201d (The ellipses are part of the memo, so, presumably, some of what the president was asking for related to this conspiracy theory is left out.)\n\u2022 \u201cMr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General.\u201d\n\n \u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I\u2019m sure you will figure it out.\u201d\n\n \u201cI will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.\u201d\n\nSo, the White House memo backs up the whistleblower\u2019s complaint on the three main asks Trump had of Zelensky in the phone call.\n\nThe complaint also said: \u201cThe President also praised Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelenskyy might want to keep him in his position.\u201d\n\nTrump twice praised a Ukrainian prosecutor general, saying, \u201cGood because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that\u2019s really unfair,\u201d according to the White House memo. \u201cI heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed that Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell \u201cread my phone call\u201d and \u201cput out a statement that said that was the most innocent phone call he\u2019s read.\u201d \u201cI spoke to him about it too,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what McConnell told Trump privately \u2014 his Senate office did not respond to a request for comment. But we did not find that McConnell used the \u201cmost innocent\u201d language in his public remarks and press releases, or on social media.\n\nMcConnell did release a statement to Politico for its Sept. 25 story about the Senate majority leader\u2019s response to \u201cTrump\u2019s Ukraine scandal.\u201d However, the statement does not support Trump\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read the summary of the call,\u201d McConnell said, according to the story. \u201cIf this is the \u2018launching point\u2019 for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment process, they\u2019ve already overplayed their hand. It\u2019s clear there is no quid pro quo that the Democrats were desperately praying for.\u201d\n\nPolitico reported that McConnell\u2019s statement also said it is \u201claughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s statement clearly dismisses some of the criticism of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, but he doesn\u2019t describe the call as \u201cinnocent,\u201d either.\n\nThe White House did not provide any other statements from McConnell.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 23: CBS News reporter Nancy Cordes asked McConnell on Oct. 22 if he told Trump that the president\u2019s phone call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201cinnocent,\u201d as Trump has claimed. McConnell said no. \u201cWe\u2019ve not had any conversations on that subject,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI don\u2019t recall any conversations with the president about that phone call.\u201d\n\nIn his Oct. 2 press conference, Trump also claimed that Sen. Rick Scott of Florida described the call as \u201ca perfect conversation.\u201d Scott didn\u2019t use those words.\n\n\u201cI heard Rick Scott today say, \u2018That was a perfect conversation. How can they impeach him on that conversation?\u2019\u201d Trump said.\n\nScott didn\u2019t say the call was \u201cperfect\u201d; he has actually said he would have said things differently than Trump. But he did say he didn\u2019t see the call as an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t see what the crime is,\u201d Scott said in a Fox News interview earlier that day. \u201cI keep saying, show me what the crime is. No one ever says that. They say he shouldn\u2019t have done it. Well, all of us would do things differently than other people would do it but if we\u2019re going to impeach somebody there ought to be something they did wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you read the transcript, the president says things differently than I would say them but, again, what they\u2019re talking about, is there a violation of law?\u201d Scott said in an interview with a Spectrum News reporter the week prior. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t see it. No one\u2019s shown me a law that the president violated.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
