Mueller III has filed an indictment against 12 Russian intelligence officers working for a military agency known as the GRU, alleging that they hacked into the servers of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Documents stolen from those servers were strategically timed for release to interfere in the 2016 election, Mueller alleged.\n\nTwo of the 12 Russian officers, Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev and Aleksandr Vladimirovich Osadchuk, gained access to state or local election systems in the United States, according to the indictment. Mueller alleged they \u201cconspired with each other and with persons, known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to hack into the computers of U.S. persons and entities responsible for the administration of 2016 U.S. elections, such as state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and U.S. companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of U.S. elections.\u201d Their goal was to \u201csteal voter data and other information stored on those computers,\u201d the indictment says.\n\nThe indictment also says Russian officials \u201chacked into the computers of a U.S. vendor \u2026 that supplied software used to verify voter registration information for the 2016 U.S. elections.\u201d They sent more than 100 phishing emails to \u201corganizations and personnel involved in administering elections in numerous Florida counties,\u201d using Word documents that displayed the hacked vendor\u2019s logo. The Intercept reported that the business described in the indictment is a match with an e-voting vendor based in Florida that denies it was hacked.\n\nThe Mueller indictment doesn\u2019t say that the GRU officers were working to help Trump\u2019s chances, but it doesn\u2019t foreclose that possibility, either. The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s January 2017 assessment says Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered a broad interference campaign that included email intrusions, propaganda efforts and breaches of the U.S. electoral system. Reading the intelligence assessment in full, it\u2019s clear these different efforts were all part of the same campaign.\n\n\u201cWe assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,\u201d the assessment says. \u201cRussia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.\u201d\n\nThe Russians allegedly targeted election systems in 21 U.S. states, but no vote-counting systems were affected, according to the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cRussian intelligence accessed elements of multiple state or local electoral boards,\u201d according to the intelligence assessment. \u201cSince early 2014, Russian intelligence has researched US electoral processes and related technology and equipment. DHS assesses that the types of systems we observed Russian actors targeting or compromising are not involved in vote tallying.\u201d\n\nRussia is not alleged to have manipulated vote totals in the 2016 election, so Nielsen\u2019s comments, in a very narrow and mathematical sense, have some merit. But she left out that widespread Russian efforts to access U.S. election systems appear to have succeeded in some cases, that Russians stole at least 500,000 U.S. voter records and that the overall Russian interference campaign was meant to favor Trump, according to Mueller and U.S. intelligence officials.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee said more evidence of \u201cRussian attempts to infiltrate state election infrastructure\u201d had emerged since the intelligence community\u2019s assessment was released in January 2017. At a joint news conference with Trump in Helsinki, Putin denied that Russia interfered in the U.S. election but said he did favor Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cYes, I wanted him to win, because he talked about the normalization of Russian-American relations,\u201d Putin said.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment doesn\u2019t have categories of different motivations for Russia\u2019s email hacking and propaganda on one side, and its targeting of U.S. election systems on the other. It\u2019s all one big plot. U.S. intelligence officials agree that the overall campaign was ordered by Putin to undermine faith in U.S. democracy, denigrate Clinton and favor Trump.\n\nNielsen is saying that U.S. election systems were targeted but that nothing shows it was to help one party. A full reading of the intelligence community\u2019s assessment shows that \u201cPutin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump\u201d and that \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s campaign aimed at the US election featured disclosures of data obtained through Russian cyber operations; intrusions into US state and local electoral boards; and overt propaganda.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security says vote-counting processes were not affected. That\u2019s important to keep in mind \u2014 as is the evidence gathered by Mueller that Russian intelligence officials gained access into U.S. election systems and stole 500,000 voter records in one state. Whether or not this helped Trump directly, the bottom line is that the intelligence community\u2019s assessment says Russia intruded into U.S. state and local electoral boards as part of an effort to give Trump an advantage. Nielsen\u2019s comments are worth Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
