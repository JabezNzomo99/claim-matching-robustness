The most widely shared iteration of the claim came in the form of a meme that featured a photograph of a woman identified as \u201cAshleigh Ingle, feminist\u201d and contained the following text:\n\nVariations of that meme, containing the same quote, could be found on Facebook and Twitter. On Instagram, Gary Holt, guitarist for the metal band Slayer, was so bemused or outraged by the concept of \u201cfart rape\u201d that he launched a line of T-shirts bearing the words \u201cFart Rapist,\u201d which he sold on eBay.\n\nThe stand-up comedian Chris d\u2019Elia was so taken by the purported quotation that he tweeted out the same meme, along with his resistance to the concept, and he earnestly discussed \u201cfart rape\u201d on his podcast, musing, \u201cIt\u2019s just farting. Why does everything have to be a global issue?\u201d\n\nIn reality, these individuals were taken in by a hoax. \u201cFart rape\u201d is not an authentic feminist concept, and the quotation attributed to Ashleigh Ingle was bogus.\n\nThe fake concept of \u201cfart rape\u201d has its origins in a December 2013 post on a relatively obscure blog called The Water Pipe, whose other posts clearly demonstrate a broader, rather aggressive anti-feminist agenda. For example, in a subsequent post on the same blog, the anonymous author asked \u201cAre chimps smarter than feminist [sic]?\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cThe chimps have demonstrated an ability to conduct their parasitical relationship with termites in a sustainable manner as to not exhaust the termite nest and thus increase chances of survival, this survival instinct is not present in feminist [sic].\n\n Feminism a social movement for white women believe that men are the perpetual oppressors of women and that violence against women, rape, aggressive behavior, are all symptoms of masculinity, thus the feminist movement has made it its primary objective to eradicate masculinity. Ironically women in their 30s who are childless, unmarried and on a steady supply of anti-depressants are now questioning \u2018Did we overdo it?'\u201d\n\nIn a Dec. 22, 2013, post entitled \u201cCan a fart be misogynist?\u201d the author wrote:\n\nTop feminist academics that have respectable diverse doctorates from medieval art, 6th century English to Women\u2019s Studies gathered at the University of Toronto meeting center to discuss if human flatulence could be sexist. Ashleigh Ingle a proud feminist and an anarchist argued that because of patriarchal gender norms women were not allowed to release gas in public because of men\u2019s unreal expectations of women to be clean and feminine. Furthermore she articulated that if a woman was to fart in the presence of a man and the man responded by farting louder than the woman, than that would be rape. \u201cBy farting louder the man is using passive aggressive violence to position himself as dominant, this intimidates the woman to subconsciously not release as much flatulence and thus the woman fearing for her safety doesn\u2019t fart as loud as a sign of submissiveness, this in turn contributes to rape culture and women being oppressed.\u201d\n\nThe article also asserted that a feminist activist named Steph Guthrie had started an online campaign to raise awareness about \u201cfart rape,\u201d claiming: \u201cGuthrie\u2019s Twitter hash tag #FartRape has started to trend \u2026\u201d\n\nBoth Ingle and Guthrie are real, feminist activists who lived in Toronto in 2013. As reported by Rebecca Watson, in September of that year Ingle and Guthrie took part in the same panel discussion at a University of Toronto conference called \u201cDisorientation Week.\u201d The topic of their panel was, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong With the MRA [Men\u2019s Rights Activism]? The Problem of Men\u2019s Rights Organizing.\u201d\n\nA Voice for Men, a website affiliated with the broader Men\u2019s Rights Movement, happened to secretly record the panel discussion. That audio file is available here. It clearly shows that neither Guthrie nor Ingle nor any other speaker made any mention whatsoever of flatulence, or any other bodily function, as a weapon of patriarchal oppression. Ingle never made the remarks attributed to her in the Water Pipe\u2019s post and in multiple subsequent memes.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that the hashtag \u201c#FartRape,\u201d purportedly devised by Guthrie, had begun trending on Twitter by December 2013, was false. A basic Twitter search clearly shows that, in fact, that hashtag only emerged in February 2014, two months after the Water Pipe blog post and was often accompanied by a link to that article.\n\nFurther red flags exist, underlining the bogusness of \u201cfart rape\u201d and the fabricated nature of the Water Pipe\u2019s claims. For example, the article offers conspicuously few details about the fictional event at which Ingle supposedly set out the principle of \u201cfart rape\u201d \u2014 writing only that the discussion took place \u201cat the University of Toronto meeting center.\u201d The blog post did not specify the date on which the event purportedly took place nor its title nor the names of any organizing groups or bodies.\n\nFinally, neither Ingle nor Guthrie nor any other feminist activists have earnestly promoted or described \u201cfart rape\u201d as an authentic feminist principle before the Water Pipe\u2019s December 2013 blog post, nor since then.\n\nTaking all these facts into account, it is clear that \u201cfart rape\u201d is not an authentic feminist principle, presented or promoted by Ingle, Guthrie, or other feminist activists during an event at the University of Toronto in 2013. Rather, a website with a demonstrable anti-feminist agenda invented the concept and falsely attributed fabricated statements to Ingle and Guthrie, apparently in an effort to discredit and attack the feminist movement in general, and certain high-profile feminists in Toronto, in particular.", "lang": "en"}
