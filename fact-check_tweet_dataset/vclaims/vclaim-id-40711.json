Malviya wrote, \u201cSince this is a season of pulling out old videos, here is one from Lucknow where anti-CAA protestors can be seen raising \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans\u2026 Damn! Someone needs to have a samvaad with them and ask them to carry tricolour and Bapu\u2019s picture for the cameras next time.\u201d\n\nIt is noteworthy that the video has surfaced on social media after a clip of Meerut SP Akhilesh Narayan Singh asking anti-CAA protesters to \u201cgo to Pakistan\u201d went viral. SP Singh defended his position with the claim, \u201cSome boys raised Pakistan zindabad slogans after seeing us.\u201d The senior police officer alleged that his \u201cgo to Pakistan\u201d statement was in response to the boys\u2019 anti-India sloganeering.\n\nThe same video was tweeted with the identical claim by Haryana BJP IT cell head Arun Yadav.\n\nMedia outlet Zee News ran a broadcast based on the video and declared that \u2018Pakistan zindabad\u2019 slogans were indeed raised at an anti-CAA rally in Lucknow on December 13. Zee News also stated that flags of Asaduddin Owaisi\u2019s party AIMIM can be spotted in the clip.\n\nRepublic broadcast a show on the video titled, \u201cUnverified Video Surfaces From UP: \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 Slogans Raised At AIMIM Rally In Lucknow.\u201d The channel spoke to a correspondent Vasudev who claimed that an FIR was lodged after the December 13 rally which states that \u2018Pakistan zindabad\u2019 slogans were raised during the protest. However, Vasudev added that no arrests have been made yet and the police are investigating who raised the chants.\n\nThe video is also massively viral on social media \u2013 Facebook and Twitter. One Neetu Garg, who is followed by PM Modi and Amit Shah, quote-tweeted Meerut SP Akhilesh Narayan Singh\u2019s statement and shared the same video. Several other users \u2013 Vinita Hindustani and Pooja Singh \u2013 tweeted the clip as well.\n\nIt has also been shared on YouTube by multiple channels including Breaking Tube.This channel has been found circulating misinformation in the past.\n\nIf one carefully listens to the audio, the protesters are not chanting \u2018Pakistan zindabad\u2019 but \u2018Kashif saab zindabad\u2019. Alt News has clipped the relevant parts and slowed down the video 2x times below. It is recommended that readers use earphones for clarity. This is how the complete slogan goes (those who wish to listen to the same portion at normal speed click here):\n\nBelow is \u2018Hindustan zindabad\u2019 played on a loop at its normal speed.\n\nKashif saab aka Kashif Ahmad is the Lucknow AIMIM chief. In a conversation with Alt News, AIMIM UP president Haji Shaukat Ali informed that Kashif Ahmad was leading the December 13 protest. Alt News confirmed that Ahmad was present at the rally. He is the man in white in the photograph below.\n\nThe video below shows Kashif Ahmad (the man in white in the middle of the crowd) raising \u2018Hindustan zindabad\u2019 slogans at the same rally.\n\nAll India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) held a protest rally against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) on December 13. Protesters marched from Clock Tower to Teele Wali Masjid in Lucknow. According to a December 15 Hindustan Timesreport, two FIRs were filed against the protestors. \u201cThe first FIR was lodged on the complaint of Satkhanda police outpost in-charge sub-inspector Rajiv Dwivedi. In his complaint, Dwivedi mentioned that a group of people gathered near Clock Tower without permission and raised anti-India slogans\u2026Another FIR for violation of prohibitory orders was lodged at Chowk police station against the protestors, who staged a demonstration when they reached Teele Wali Masjid.\u201d However, CAA protesters and AIMIM representatives claimed that they had held a peaceful protest and did not raise any slogan against the country.\n\nAlt News was able to access a copy of both the FIRs. Media outlet Republic\u2019s claim that the FIR mentions \u2018Pakistan zindabad\u2019 slogans were raised is false. As per the complaint, protesters at AIMIM rally raised slogans against the Indian government, NRC and CAA. It also mentions that they chanted provocative slogans. The FIRs were lodged under various sections of the IPC, including sedition.\n\nAccording to a December 18 report by The Indian Express, the police dropped sedition charges saying they \u201ccould not be substantiated.\u201d\n\nMultiple social media users, media outlets Republic and Zee News, and BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared the video in question with a false claim. The protesters did not chant \u2018Pakistan zindabad\u2019 but \u2018Kashif saab zindabad\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
