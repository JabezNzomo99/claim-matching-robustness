They\u2019ll do a great job that they\u2019re making much more than the minimum wage. But I think having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country.\u201d Trump: \u201cI want to keep the minimum wage pretty much where it is right now \u2014\u201d Trump: \u201c\u2014 because of the fact that we have a country that is now competing more than ever before because of airplanes and transportation and the Internet.\u201d Todd: \u201cSo you think we got to keep the minimum wage lower?\u201d Trump: \u201cWell I want to compete with the rest of the world. I want to compete with the rest of the world. What I do want to do is bring in jobs so much so that people don\u2019t have to live on minimum wage. But we are going to have to compete with the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nNeil Cavuto: \u201cJust a few hours ago, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed doing the same for all state workers, the first governor to do so [raise the minimum wage to $15]. Mr. Trump, as the leading presidential candidate on this stage and one whose tax plan exempts couples making up to $50,000 a year from paying any federal income taxes at all, are you sympathetic to the protesters cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year?\u201d Trump: \u201cI can\u2019t be, Neil. And the and the reason I can\u2019t be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We don\u2019t win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I\u2019ve come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. It\u2019s going to be a tremendous plan. I think it\u2019ll make our country and our economy very dynamic. But, taxes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we cannot do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can\u2019t do it.\u201d Cavuto: \u201cSo do not raise the minimum wage?\u201d Trump: \u201cI would not do it.\u201d Mika Brzezinski: \u201cLast night I heard you say you would keep the minimum wage as is, you would not raise it. \u2026 Do you have people working for you making $7.50 an hour? No.\u201d Trump: \u201cYeah, probably, maybe I do somewhere along the line. I got thousands of people. But you know what? We have to become competitive with the world. Our taxes are too high, our wages are too high. Everything is too high. We have to compete with other countries, and if we\u2019re going to just say hey, I just seen in New York where they made it $15, well you\u2019re going to \u2014\u201d Brzezinski: \u201cOur wages are not \u2014 I mean, you can argue our wages are flat.\u201d Trump: \u201cListen to this. What\u2019s going to happen is now people are going to start firing people because they\u2019re going to \u2014 You know, the old story. It\u2019s happened a hundred times. It\u2019s always happening. But I\u2019m not even saying from that standpoint, Mika. We have got to do something to compete with the rest of the world. Our country is not competitive anymore.\u201d\n\nBret Baier: In the debate, you said wages are too high. What do you say to somebody in South Carolina where the median per capita income is only about $24,000 and wages are stagnant and costs are going up? Trump: I didn\u2019t say that. Bret, we were talking about the minimum wage. \u2026 They said should we increase the minimum wage? And I\u2019m saying that if we\u2019re going to compete with other countries, we can\u2019t do that because the wages would be too high. \u2026 I\u2019ll say raise the minimum wage to $15. Raise the minimum wage to whatever it might be. But the problem we have is that our country is losing businesses. You look at corporate inversions and all the things that are happening. We have to compete with the rest of the world. The question was about the minimum wage. I\u2019m not talking about wages being too high, I\u2019m talking about minimum wage. And that was the question.\n\nQuestion: \u201cWhat are your thoughts on minimum wage and the Fight for 15 movement [to raise federal minimum wages]?\u201d Trump: \u201cOkay, you know, the minimum wage is a very, very complex situation, because we are a noncompetitive country. We \u2014 if you look at what\u2019s going on throughout the world, we\u2019re considered \u2014 and one of the big problems we have are wages. I am going to make our country so competitive that people at minimum wage are going to escape the minimum wage. They\u2019re going to go up and they\u2019re going to make a lot of money and they\u2019re going to have companies and be involved with companies that are really successful, where they can be paid more and more money. But if you start raising that minimum wage, you\u2019re going to make a lot of our companies even more noncompetitive. And it would be a big, big problem.\u201d The Citizen: \u201cThe New York state budget raises the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next several years. Stagnant wages are obviously a concern. How would the Trump administration address this issue?\u201d Trump: \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure that people are making much more money because we\u2019re going to bring so many jobs back that we\u2019re not going to have to be worrying about minimum wage so much. We\u2019re going to be bringing the jobs back where people can really make a good living, not just a minimum wage living. I\u2019m going to be bringing so many jobs back into this state and I\u2019m going to be focused very strongly on the state. It\u2019s a state I love. We\u2019re going to bring jobs back so that people can really get out there and make a tremendous living again. You look at wages, they effectively haven\u2019t gone up in close to 20 years. We\u2019re going to bring so much competition back and so many jobs back that people are going to make a far better living than anything you can even talk about with respect to minimum wage.\u201d \u2014 Interview with the Auburn Citizen in New York, April 15, 2016\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: \u201cMinimum wage \u2014 all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you\u2019re saying you\u2019re looking at it. So what\u2019s your bottom line on this?\u201d Trump: \u201cWell, I am looking at it and I haven\u2019t decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more.\u201d Stephanopoulos: \u201cBut that\u2019s a change from where you were during the primary.\u201d Trump: \u201cWell, sure it\u2019s a change. I\u2019m allowed to change. You need flexibility, George, whether it\u2019s a tax plan where you\u2019re going to \u2014 where you know you\u2019re going to negotiate. But we\u2019re going to come up with something. But my real minimum wage is going to be \u2014 I\u2019m going to bring companies back into this country and they\u2019re going to make a lot more than the $15 even. They\u2019re going to make a lot more than that.\u201d Chuck Todd: \u201cMinimum wage. Minimum wage. At a debate, you know. You remember what you said. You thought you didn\u2019t want to touch it. Now you\u2019re open to it. What changed?\u201d Trump: \u201cLet me just tell you, I\u2019ve been traveling the country for many months. Since June 16th. I\u2019m all over. Today I\u2019m in the state of Washington, where the arena right behind me, you probably hear, is packed with thousands and thousands of people. I\u2019m doing that right after I finish you. I have seen what\u2019s going on. And I don\u2019t know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I\u2019d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don\u2019t forget, the states have to compete with each other. So you may have a governor \u2014\u201d Todd: \u201cRight. You want the fed \u2014 but should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states \u2014\u201d Trump: \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they\u2019re out there. They\u2019re working. It is a very low number. You know, with what\u2019s happened to the economy, with what\u2019s happened to the cost. I mean, it\u2019s just \u2014 I don\u2019t know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe minimum wage has to go up. People are \u2014 at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states \u2014 federal \u2014 I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It\u2019s very expensive in New York. You can\u2019t buy a hot dog for the money you\u2019re talking about. You go to other states and it\u2019s not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I\u2019m really going to do on the minimum wage \u2014 but it has to go up. \u2026 So I would like to raise it to at least $10, and what I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you\u2019re talking about are going to \u2014 literally, they\u2019re going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country, because I\u2019m going to bring jobs back from Mexico, which is booming, booming. I have a friend who builds plants and he\u2019s a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day \u2014 great guy. He builds massive plants, for automobiles, for computers, for anything. That\u2019s what he does. I think he\u2019s the biggest, but certainly one of the biggest.", "lang": "en"}
