Here's an update as he enters his fourth year as president.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2020-01-17T08:00:53.302Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86321", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/17/trump-has-broken-more-promises-than-hes-kept/", "vclaim": "During the 2016 campaign, Trump made more than 280 promises, though many were contradictory or just uttered in a single campaign event. So that posed a conundrum: What would be a good list of promises to track that Trump was really serious about? We did not think it would be fair to rate a promise that might have been tossed out without much serious discussion by the candidate and his staff.\n\nBut Trump did issue a specific plan \u2014 what he called the \u201cContract with the American Voter.\u201d He even signed it with his distinctive signature and invited supporters to sign their own copies. That plan listed 60 promises, some of which he said he would fulfill on the day he took the oath of office. Others, he said, would be implemented or launched in his first 100 days.\n\nAnnounce the U.S. intention to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or withdraw from the deal. A few months after taking office, Trump tweeted that he had spoken to the presidents of Mexico and Canada about renegotiating NAFTA. \u201cI agreed, subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA,\u201d he wrote. This appears to fulfill his promise to announce this threat. Eventually, the administration negotiated an updated version of the trade pact, relabeled the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nProvide veterans with the ability to receive public Department of Veterans Affairs treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice. In 2018, Trump signed the bipartisan VA Mission Act, which expanded access for veterans to VA-funded care in the private sector. (This built on a law passed under Obama.) Rules established under the law took effect in 2019, with VA paying veterans to see non-VA doctors if they have to wait longer than 20 days or drive more than 30 minutes for primary or mental health care at a VA facility. For specialty care, they can see private doctors at VA expense if they have to wait longer than 28 days or drive more than an hour to see a VA provider.\n\nDirect the treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator. This was a promise broken at first \u2014 and then suddenly kept. On April 12, 2017, Trump announced he would not label China a currency manipulator \u2014 something he had pledged to do on his first day in office. Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he had changed his mind because China was not currently manipulating its currency, though that was already apparent during the election season. But then, on Aug. 5, 2019, he tweeted that China was manipulating its currency after the yuan fell below seven to the dollar, following Trump\u2019s announcement of additional tariffs. The Treasury Department applied the largely symbolic label a few hours later. (This week, Trump dropped the designation ahead of a trade-deal signing, but we will note this as a promise kept.)\n\nRequire that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. There are various ways one could try to count whether this promise has been achieved, not all of which would support the administration, but there is little doubt that the president has attacked regulations. To achieve this ratio, the administration does not tally only \u201ceconomically significant\u201d items but includes minor deregulatory actions, such as allowing the importation of fresh pomelo fruit from Thailand and deregulation of the pine shoot beetle.\n\nChange visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying. Trump, in a 2019 presidential memo, declared visa overstay rates \u201cunacceptably high\u201d and called them a \u201cwidespread problem.\u201d On the basis of a Department of Homeland Security report, he instructed federal agencies to consider action against countries that have business and tourism travelers \u2014 using the popular B1 and B2 visas \u2014 who overstay in the United States at a rate higher than 10 percent. (Twenty countries have overstay rates higher than 10 percent, according to the DHS report. Except for Syria and Nigeria, these countries accounted for fewer than 1,000 overstayers each.)\n\nMake Mexico reimburse the United States for the full cost of the border wall. In a phone conversation with Mexico\u2019s president on Jan. 27, 2017, a transcript of which was provided to The Washington Post and published Aug. 3, Trump indicated that he would not fulfill this promise but would not say so publicly, because it would hurt him politically. He pressed his Mexican counterpart to not raise the issue or suggest that he would not pursue his promise. \u201cYou cannot say that to the press,\u201d Trump said, according to the transcript. \u201cThe press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that.\u201d Since that conversation, Trump has rarely raised the issue and made no move to force compliance by Mexico. Instead, he has seized billions of dollars from previously approved military construction projects and redirected the money to fund his border barrier. At a campaign rally on Tuesday, Trump asserted that \u201cMexico\u2019s paying for the wall, you know that, you will see that,\u201d but this remains one of his biggest broken promises.\n\nExpand the economy 4 percent a year. In 2017, the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent, well short of Trump\u2019s promised target. In 2018, the GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, still far short of Trump\u2019s 4 percent goal. For 2019, analysts estimate the GDP grew about 2.2 or 2.3 percent. Unless something dramatic happens in 2020 \u2014 the consensus is that annual growth will be 1.9 percent \u2014 Trump will never meet his goal, and so this is a promise broken. He never even achieved this goal on a quarterly basis.\n\nCancel visas to countries that won\u2019t take back criminal immigrants in the United States illegally. Trump was slow to act on this pledge. In September 2017, the Trump administration announced visa restrictions against four relatively small countries \u2014 Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea and Sierra Leone, followed by Myanmar and Laos in 2018 and Ghana and Pakistan in 2019. He has not targeted China, one of the biggest offenders, but eight of the 10 countries that have faced such sanctions have been named during the Trump administration. Given that Trump suggested during the campaign that he would target all countries, this will be considered a compromise.", "lang": "en"}
