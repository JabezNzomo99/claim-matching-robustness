Let\u2019s try to find the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nFact: The video shared in the post is on social media at least from 1 July 2019, and was identified as that of the clashes between the workers of the TMC and BJP in Dinhata, West Bengal. Hence, the claim that the video belongs to the recent riots in Delhi is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the posted video were reverse image searched on Google, the same video but posted on a different Facebook post was found. It was uploaded by a user on 01 July 2019, but the user didn\u2019t share any information related to the video on the post. It can also be seen here that the same video was uploaded on YouTube in July 2019. From this information, it can be understood that the video was circulating on social media at least from July 2019 and is not related to the recent riots in Delhi.\n\n\n\nThe same video was shared last year with different claims, once as the one related to of clashes in Tripura, and on another occasion as that of the situation in Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370.\n\nThese claims have been debunked earlier and the video was identified as that of the clashes between the workers of the TMC and BJP in Dinhata, West Bengal.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video from West Bengal is being falsely shared as an incident from the recent riots in Delhi.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
