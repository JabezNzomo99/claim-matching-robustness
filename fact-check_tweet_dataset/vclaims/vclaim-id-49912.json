The tweet called on South Dakota to \u201ckeep there [sic] border with California closed!\u201d\n\nTrump did travel to South Dakota to give a speech at Mount Rushmore on July 3, but he did not post the above tweet, which incorrectly states that the states of South Dakota and California share a border.\n\nThe purported tweet doesn\u2019t appear on Trump\u2019s Twitter timeline on July 4, 2020, nor does it appear in a database that collects Trump\u2019s tweets or an archive that stores his deleted tweets.\n\nBecause we found no evidence that Trump posted the above tweet, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
