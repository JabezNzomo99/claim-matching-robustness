The Americans spit on that.\u201d\n\nZhilin\u2019s claim that the NATO aircraft violated international law is false. Experts and NATO officials tell Polygraph.info that the F-16 acted within established rules of air policing, without violating any norms or agreements, and that, on the contrary, it was Shoigu\u2019s plane that violated established aviation safety rules by refusing to identify itself.\n\nWhile the June 21 incident was not an isolated occurrence of NATO and Russian aircraft testing each other in close proximity, it was the first time a high-ranking government official was involved. \n\n \n\n A reporter on Shoigu\u2019s plane filmed the incident. The video footage shows an F-16 flying parallel to the Russian minister\u2019s TU-154 at a safe distance, as a Russian Su-27 military jet gets between them and sways side to side to show that it is armed. After that, the F-16 breaks away.\n\nNATO claims it sent the F-16 to identify three Russian aircraft flying over the Baltic \u2013 the TU-154 and two Su-27s \u2013 that had not responded to air traffic control\u2019s repeated requests to identify themselves.\n\n \n\n An official at NATO\u2019s Allied Air Command told Polygraph.info via email that NATO conducts air policing operations in line with the standards and regulations of the International Civil Aviation Organization. When aircraft fail to identify themselves, NATO may scramble jets to conduct visual identification.\n\nThis method of policing is used when an aircraft \u201cdoes not talk to civilian air traffic control, or does not have a flight plan, or does not use a transponder to transmit [an] identifying signal,\u201d the NATO official wrote.\n\n \n\n The NATO official detailed the July 21 incident, saying that \u201ca Polish Air Force F-16, presently deployed at \u0160iauliai Air Base, Lithuania, conducted an intercept\u201d and \u201cbroke away\u201d after the visual identification. Contrary to Zhilin\u2019s claim, however, \u201cNATO had no information about passengers on board,\u201d the official said.\n\nAccording to NATO, none of the three Russian aircraft involved in the June 21 incident transmitted identifying signals.\n\n\u201cIt was the Russian plane that violated international safety agreements by failing to identify itself and failing to respond to air traffic control,\u201d said Jorge Benitez, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security and director of NATOSource, the council\u2019s website covering news about the alliance.\n\n\u201cThe Russian plane had its transponder turned off, which normally would broadcast the identity of the plane,\u201d Benitez told Polygraph.info in an email. \u201cThis is something done frequently by Russian military planes and it is a safety hazard for civilian planes in the congested skies over the Baltic Sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the Russians staged the Shoigu incident carefully, to create a video of something they could mischaracterize as a NATO provocation,\u201d Benitez said, adding that \u201cthis entire incident was initiated by the Russians when they failed to identify their plane, thus making NATO have to send a jet to identify it visually.\u201d\n\nBenitez said that unlike incidents in which Russian fighter planes have flown close to Western military aircraft, \u201cthe NATO jet flew only a safe distance near the Russian plane, not five feet or two meters.\u201d\n\nOn June 20, an armed Russian fighter jet came within five feet of the wing-tip of an unarmed U.S. RC-135 reconnaissance plane.\n\nA day earlier, a Russian Su-27 fighter jet reportedly flew within two meters of a Swedish Air Force S102B reconnaissance plane. The Swedish Defense Minister called the incident \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d and summoned the Russian ambassador for an explanation.\n\n\u201cThese and other incidents could easily be avoided if Russia stopped behaving recklessly and flew its aircraft according to the international safety agreements followed by the rest of the world\u2019s aviation,\u201d Benitez told Polygraph.info.", "lang": "en"}
