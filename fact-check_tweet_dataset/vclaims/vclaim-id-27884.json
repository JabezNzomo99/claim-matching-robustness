This has a focus on the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. A \u201cbackstop\u201d provision has been included in the draft Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and EU.\n\nThe BBC has provided a outline of the issues concerning \u201cThe Backstop\u201d. The Irish border Brexit backstop (or \u201cThe Backstop\u201d) concerns both the UK and EU\u2019s commitment to avoiding the return of what could be considered a \u201chard border\u201d \u2014 physical checks or infrastructure \u2014 after Brexit.\n\nThe backstop is a position of last resort to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing what the BBC term \u201can all-encompassing deal\u201d.\n\nA regular opinion poll is carried out in Northern Ireland by the company, LucidTalk, which describes its \u201cNI Tracker Poll\u201d as taking place \u201cevery 3 months to constantly gauge and estimate NI public opinion on a wide range of issues e.g. politics, business, consumer, lifestyle etc.\u201d. It outlines the methodology employed to ensure a representative sample of the Northern Ireland population in the following terms, for a poll it carried out between 30 November and 3 December 2018:\n\n\u201cThe project targeted the established LucidTalk NI-Wide Opinion Panel (11,227 members) which is balanced by gender, age group, area of residence, and community background, in order to be demographically representative of Northern Ireland (NI). 1,334 full responses were considered in terms of the final results, and a data auditing process ensured all completed poll-surveys were genuine \u2018one-person, one-vote\u2019 responses, and also to ensure a robust NI representative sample of opinion. This 1,334 responses dataset was/is a demographically representative sample of Northern Ireland \u2014 producing results representative of NI Opinion to within an error of +/-3%.\u201d\n\nWhere does 60% come from?\n\nIn interrogating this claim, the only relevant and detailed opinion poll that we are aware of was one conducted by LucidTalk that was published in December 2018. The relevant \u201cbackstop\u201d polling question is Question 4:\n\n\u201cOne proposal for Brexit that avoids any hard border in Ireland, is for Northern Ireland to remain closely tied to the EU, inside the single market and the customs union, while Britain has a more arms-length arrangement. Which of these comes closest to your view of this idea?\u201d\n\nThe results of which are outlined in the following table:\n\nFor all respondents and those who identified as \u201cUnionists\u201d, the results to the question were:\n\nThe negative responses (\u201coppose\u201d) can be interpreted as being against any \u201cspecial status\u201d for Northern Ireland, whether through a \u201cbackstop\u201d provision in any agreement between the UK and EU.\n\nWe note that 60% of those who identified as \u201cUnionist\u201d in this poll were opposed to the question proposal because \u201cit would be bad for the NI economy\u201d. This is the same figure cited by Mr Shannon, who attributed it to all respondents.\n\nFor Unionist respondents, 69% (60% + 9%) were opposed to any special status for Northern Ireland.\n\nFor all respondents, 35% (29% + 6%) were opposed; 65% supported (\u201cwelcomed\u201d) a special status.\n\nJim Shannon MP spoke in the House of Commons, claiming that an opinion poll carried out in Northern Ireland showed that 60% of respondents were opposed to a backstop provision (referring to the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement).\n\nIt appears to us that Mr Shannon was referring to a segment of respondents who identified as Unionist in a poll carried out by LucidTalk and answered a question in opposition to a proposed \u201cspecial status\u201d for Northern Ireland.\n\nFor all respondents to this LucidTalk poll, 35% were opposed to any special status; 65% replied that they would welcome one.\n\nImage source: \u201cSoccer Field\u201d by Sonja Guina on Unsplash (no known copyright).\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
