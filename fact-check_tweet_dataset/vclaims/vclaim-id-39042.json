Let\u2019s try to analyze the extent of truth in this post.\n\n\n\nIn the process of verifying the information about the shared photo, it was found that when the same photo was circulated on Twitter, a journalist has tweeted the original photo saying that the photo shared in the post is fake. In the original photo tweeted by him, no cow is visible and Adityanath is seen drinking water from a hand pump. When the two photos are compared with each other, it can be seen that the surroundings in both photos are the same.\n\n\n\nWhen the portion of the cow in the posted photo was cropped and searched on the internet, the complete photo of that cow was found on this website. The back portion of the cow from that photo was used to create the photo that was shared in the post.\n\nTo sum it up, the photo of Adityanath drinking urine from a cow is a photoshopped image.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
