It\u2019s based on whether you are \u201cordinarily resident\u201d in the UK and the type of treatment you need.\n\nThe government estimates that normal use of the NHS, by people who aren\u2019t \u201cordinarily resident\u201d, but who don\u2019t come to the UK specifically to use the NHS, is around \u00a31.8 billion a year. This can include holiday makers who injure themselves while in the UK or someone who gets sick while in the UK for work temporarily.\n\nWhen it made this estimate in 2012/13 the government said it thought that about \u00a3190 million of this figure could be charged directly to patients and another \u00a3220 million charged to European Economic Area (EEA) countries under the European Health Insurance Card scheme.\n\nDeliberate health tourism means those who come to the UK deliberately to use NHS services they\u2019re not entitled to for free. Those taking advantage of the system are those who frequently come to the UK and are able to use GP services and other treatments like prescriptions. This could even include British expats who return to the UK to see a trusted doctor.\n\nIt is this group the Mirror refers to when it says that health tourism costs 0.3% of NHS spending.\n\nWhat does it cost?\n\nThe government has estimated that treating deliberate health tourists and those taking advantage costs around \u00a3100 to \u00a3300 million a year. Those are incredibly rough figures.\n\nAt the moment there are some services which, no matter whether you are \u201cordinarily resident\u201d or not, you can\u2019t be charged for. The costs estimated by the government also include these services, like going to see a GP or using Accident and Emergency. So even if the NHS charged for all the services it possibly could and received the money, it wouldn\u2019t cover the full amount health tourism is estimated to cost.\n\nSo how does that compare to overall NHS spending?\n\nThe Mirror compared the upper estimate of \u00a3300 million spent on deliberate health tourism and those taking advantage to the \u00a391.5 billion allocated to specific NHS services in 2012/13. That\u2019s just over 0.3%.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a thorough analysis of the costs of health tourism more recently so we can\u2019t say whether or not this proportion spent on deliberate health tourism has changed.\n\nLooking at this another way, the upper estimate for the cost of deliberate health tourism would be around \u00a3311 million in 2015/16 prices. Assuming this figure is still roughly the same then that would have been around 0.31% of the total NHS budget for that year and 0.27% of the Department of Health\u2019s total budget.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a particularly accurate measure\u2014we\u2019ve just used GDP growth as a basis for inflation here\u2014 but it gives a rough idea of the cost of \u201cdeliberate health tourism\u201d and services used by those \u201ctaking advantage\u201d.\n\nWhat can be recovered?\n\nThe government aims to recover \u00a3500 million a year by 2017/18 from all patients not eligible for free treatment on the NHS. In 2015/16 it charged \u00a3289 million, although we don\u2019t know how much of this it received. It has also predicted that it won\u2019t meet the 2017/18 aim and will charge \u00a3346 million that year.\n\nFrom April 2015, non-EEA citizens who come to the UK for longer than six months as students or temporary migrants have been required to pay a \u201chealth surcharge\u201d as part of their visa process. This allows them to access NHS care free of charge during their stay in the UK. Most of the increase in NHS charging in 2015/16 came from this.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about the costs of health tourism before.", "lang": "en"}
