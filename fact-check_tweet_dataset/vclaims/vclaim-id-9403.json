Because of the proposed referendum in the South, they published figures today and said last year, 43 women went to England for an abortion. So these figures are greatly exaggerated.\u201d\n\nThere were just under 4,000 women from Ireland and Northern Ireland who had an abortion in England or Wales in 2016.\n\n724 women living in Northern Ireland had an abortion in England or Wales in 2016, along with another 3,265 from the Republic of Ireland. These made up 83% of all abortions to women who weren\u2019t living in England or Wales.\n\nIn Scotland there were seven abortions performed on women who weren\u2019t resident in the country in 2016\u2014although there is no more information on where they were from. But the Scottish government says that women from outside Scotland might be counted as Scottish residents if they provide a temporary Scottish address.\n\nAltogether over 190,000 abortions took place in England and Wales last year and 12,000 in Scotland.\n\nThe audience member may have been referring to the situation in one of Dublin\u2019s maternity hospitals, according to evidence given to a committee of Irish politicians by Dr Rhona Mahony. She told the committee that \u201c60 women attending our service travelled to the UK for termination of pregnancy in the context of foetal anomaly in 2016, and to date this year at Holles Street [the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin], 43 women have travelled in this context.\u201d\n\nAbortion is illegal in Northern Ireland unless it is done only to preserve the life of the mother. In Ireland a referendum on the eighth amendment to the Constitution (giving a mother and unborn child an equal right to life) is scheduled for 2018.", "lang": "en"}
