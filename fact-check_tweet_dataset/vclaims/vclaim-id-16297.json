Bill Nelson spent the week after the 2016 election fighting against a bill that would have steered more royalties from oil drilling to some Gulf states.\n\nNelson\u2019s state of Florida already bans offshore oil drilling near its coasts. But Nelson feared that by dangling more royalties, state leaders would be more open to drilling near Florida in the future.\n\nIn a speech on the Senate floor Nov. 16, Nelson said President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s position on the issue is concerning to environmentalists.\n\n\"Ever since I was a young congressman, I\u2019ve been fighting to keep oil rigs off of Florida\u2019s coast,\" he said, \"and now it's especially important at this time as we have a new administration coming in that took a public position in the election declaring the president-elect's intent to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling.\"\n\nThe American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016, sponsored by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., failed to get enough Senate votes to move forward on Nov. 17. But the future of oil drilling along coasts in Florida and the United States will remain a hot topic of conversation under Trump\u2019s administration and potentially in Nelson\u2019s re-election campaign in 2018.\n\nHere we will look at Trump\u2019s position on opening up additional coastal areas to drill for oil. We heard back from Nelson\u2019s office but not from Trump\u2019s transition team.\n\nTrump generally spoke in favor of offshore oil drilling during the campaign, although his position wasn\u2019t always clear.\n\nHe sounded skeptical about a proposal in Congress to allow offshore drilling closer to Florida in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February.\n\n\"They've already got plenty in the Gulf,\" Trump said. \"It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing.\"\n\nIn 2006, Congress -- with input and support from Nelson -- passed a bill to ban oil drilling within 125 miles off much of Florida\u2019s coast and up to 235 miles at some points. The ban is set to expire in 2022.\n\nIn 2015, Cassidy introduced the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act, which would allow drilling 50 miles off Florida\u2019s Gulf shores. In response, Nelson filed a bill to extend the ban by five years. Neither bill reached a Senate vote.\n\nTrump was more forceful about his support for drilling since that time in speeches and press releases that we found through our own research and in Trump\u2019s statements sent to us by Nelson\u2019s Senate spokesman.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump\u2019s America First Energy Plan called for opening up onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands, eliminating a moratorium on coal leasing, and opening shale energy deposits.\n\nTrump called for unleashing \"America\u2019s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves.\"\n\nIn a May 2016 speech to the North Dakota Petroleum Council, Trump said that in his first 100 days in office, he would \"lift moratoriums on energy production in federal area. We\u2019re going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies. These technologies create millions of jobs with a smaller footprint than ever before.\"\n\nHe reiterated those views during a September 2016 speech at the 2016 Shale Insight Conference.\n\nTrump\u2019s position has remained the same since he won\n\nAfter Trump won Nov. 8, his transition team posted an energy policy that stated the administration will open onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands and waters and streamline the permitting process for all energy projects.\n\nA few days after Trump won, one of his economic advisers, Stephen Moore, told NPR that Trump\u2019s administration believes it can raise \"hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years\" by opening up more federal lands for leases for oil and gas development and coal development.\n\nOn Nov. 18, the Obama administration took the opposite approach, banning offshore drilling in the Arctic as part of a new five-year plan for energy development in federal waters.\n\nTrump won\u2019t be able to instantly toss Obama\u2019s ban. His administration will have to prepare a report which could take as long as two years, and then the federal government would have to organize a sale of leases for companies that want to drill there, the Washington Post reported.\n\nAlthough Trump wants more drilling, he may have to wait years for it. CNBC reported that Trump\u2019s plan to expand oil drilling probably won\u2019t happen until his successor is in the White House. Reasons for delay include the years it takes to start projects, local and state governments sometimes oppose drilling, and market forces.\n\nNelson said that Trump said during the campaign he intends \"to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling.\"\n\nIn official campaign and transition team statements, Trump repeatedly has called for making it easier to drill for oil. He called for opening offshore areas and reducing \"unnecessary restrictions.\" Since he won, Trump\u2019s administration has reiterated its pro-drilling stance.\n\nHe hasn't been so clear about his specific plans for Florida. In one interview, he appeared skeptical about expanding offshore drilling closer to Florida. He is limited in the extent that he could expand drilling anywhere near Florida\u2019s coasts because current law bans it within at least 125 miles.\n\nWith that caveat, we rate Nelson\u2019s point Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
