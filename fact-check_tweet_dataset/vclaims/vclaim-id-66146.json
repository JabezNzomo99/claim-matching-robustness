False.\n\nNow comes a claim, made in response to a boast by Gov. Scott Walker, that the $3 billion incentives offer is the largest of its kind. The exchange occurred Aug. 7, 2017 exchange on Twitter, a week and a half after Foxconn, the maker of iPhones and other electronics, announced it would be coming to Wisconsin.\n\nOur bold reforms have prepared WI for Foxconn & thousands of jobs. Hard-working families will reap the benefits! #WIWinning\n\nYou are willing to give the largest gift ever by a state to a foreign company. You got #foxconned, big guy.\n\nWisconsin clearly isn\u2019t offering a gift. The incentives are tied to Foxconn making investments in the plant and in payroll.\n\nBut the best available source indicates the $3 billion would be the largest ever subsidy provided by a state to a foreign company.\n\nTo back its claim, One Wisconsin Now cited June 2017 data from Good Jobs First, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that calls itself \"a leading monitor and critic of company-specific subsidy deals,\" and has called the the Foxconn deal \"a sure loser for Wisconsin taxpayers.\"\n\nWe checked with a number of experts on subsidies and none said they knew of any other compilation of subsidies. The experts include Todd Berry, president of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance; Jon Peacock, director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project; and economists Michael Leeds of Temple University, Charley Ballard of Michigan State University, Jeffrey Michael of the University of Pacific in Stockton, Calif., Sean Snaith at the University of Central Florida; Ball State University\u2019s Michael Hicks; and Tim Bartik of the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.\n\nHicks, who heads Ball State\u2019s Center for Business and Economic Research, told us that while he hasn\u2019t always agreed with analyses done by Good Jobs First, the group\u2019s data on subsidies is solid. And Bartik said it is the best such database he knows.\n\nHere are the top 12 subsidies given to companies by states, cities or counties, according to Good Jobs First:\n\nThe top 11 subsidies are all for American companies.\n\nAt No. 12 is the estimated $1.65 billion in tax credits Pennsylvania approved for Royal Dutch Shell, which is based in The Netherlands. That package of tax breaks over 25 years was aimed at getting the company to build an ethane refinery that would include a minimum investment of $1 billion and employ at least 2,500 people.\n\nUsing the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, $1.65 billion in 2012 was worth about $2.39 billion as of July 2017 -- so, still well below Wisconsin\u2019s $3 billion offer to Foxconn.\n\nBut there are at least two important points to consider.\n\n1. The $3 billion wouldn\u2019t be a gift, as One Wisconsin Now calls it. That\u2019s the maximum amount the state would pay Foxconn, and only if the company spends roughly $18 billion -- about $9 billion for payroll and $9 billion in capital investments.\n\n2. It\u2019s difficult to calculate the value of the jobs that the various incentives are aimed at creating -- or keeping. Some jobs pay more than others, of course. And some businesses are more likely than others to attract suppliers that might, in turn, create more jobs in a state.\n\nSupporters of the Foxconn deal say Wisconsin would win a keystone manufacturer that would bring world-leading technology and attract suppliers that would create their own jobs. Critics say it amounts to a multibillion-dollar bet on a company that makes screens \u2014 a product subject to constant market-disrupting competition and innovation.\n\nOne Wisconsin Now says Wisconsin's $3 billion incentive offer to Foxconn is \"the largest gift ever by a state to a foreign company.\"\n\nThe $3 billion wouldn\u2019t be given -- it would be paid, in increments, based on how much Foxconn spends on capital investments and payroll.\n\nBut the only compilation of government subsidies we found shows that the Foxconn offer would exceed the highest subsidy provided to a foreign company -- $1.65 billion in 2012, made by Pennsylvania to Dutch Royal Shell, based in The Netherlands.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information, our rating is Half True.", "lang": "en"}
