But it was a slip of tongue as seen in the original video of the press conference.\n\nAt 0:40 seconds, it can be clearly seen that he realised his mistake and rectified it by saying, \u201c UPA government ka aana nishchit hai aur jo maha gathbandhan ho raha hai, vo buhut shaandaar tarikey se ho raha hai. Buhut acchi meeting ho rahi hai. Ek meeting ho chuki hai. Sabka sankalp hai ki jo NDA government hai, inka ravaiya jo hai, vishesh roop se do log raaj kar rahe hain \u2013 Modi ji aur Amit Shah ji. BJP ka raaj nhi hai desh ke andar.\u201d (Translated: It is certain that the UPA government will come to power and the establishment of maha gathbandhan is in full form. A meeting has been done regarding the same. Everybody is determined that the NDA government is primarily being ruled by two people \u2013 Modi ji and Amit Shah ji. BJP has no role to play in the country.)", "lang": "en"}
