These have been shared at least 17,888 times as of posting.\n\nThe facts: Putting peeled onions in a room will not prevent COVID-19 or a coronavirus infection, according to the National Onion Association (NOA) in the US. There are no official cures or vaccines for COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of Tuesday, March 31, though there are cures and vaccines in testing.

The claim has persisted over the years, with raw cut onions having been said to ward off smallpox, influenza, and other infectious diseases.\n\nIrwin Goldman, a professor at the Department of Agriculture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, also said in a statement for NOA: \"There is some evidence that the compounds found in onion may have anti-viral properties, and there are some published scientific studies that demonstrate some protective effects of onion compounds on the influenza virus. Nothing is yet known on whether the compounds found in onion would have protective or inhibitory effects on COVID-19.\"\n\nThe WHO has not debunked this particular claim, but has previously said that garlic will not prevent coronavirus infection, saying: \"Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.\"", "lang": "en"}
