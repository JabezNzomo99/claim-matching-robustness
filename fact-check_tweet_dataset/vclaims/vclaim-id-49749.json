The claim is misleading; health experts told AFP there is insufficient scientific evidence that the concoction can cure kidney stones; Thailand\u2019s Department of Medical Science warned that excessive consumption of aluminium can cause Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe claim was published here on Facebook on April 2, 2020. It has been shared almost 300 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201c# Formulated to dissolve kidney stones\u2026use 1 glass of coconut water diluted by a thumb-size potassium alum, 2-3 times, remove the potassium alum and drink it, do it for five days, once a day and stop. If your symptoms are not better, do it until it gets better.\u201d\n\n\u201cPotassium alum\u201d refers to potassium aluminium sulfate, a chemical compound composed of potassium, aluminium and sulphate ions. It is commonly used in water purification and the manufacturing of coloured dyes.\n\nSimilar claims were shared here on Twitter in 2011 and here on YouTube in 2019. It was also published more recently on Facebook here in 2020.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nDuring a phone conversation with AFP on July 16, 2020, Dr. Pakkapol Bamrungphuet, a urologist at Thailand\u2019s Taksin Hospital said: \u201cThere are studies that say drinking coconut water can prevent you from stones. However, you can\u2019t expect it to be very effective because the studies about this are still unclear, and it can\u2019t be used to cure all types of kidney stones.\n\n\u201cThe medical treatment for kidney stones varies, depending on the type and size, such as taking medication, shock wave lithotripsy or surgery.\u201d\n\nDr. Bamrungphuet recommended drinking two litres of clean water daily, regular exercise and eating healthily to avoid stones forming in the body.\n\nThailand\u2019s Department of Medical Science published this statement on November 12, 2012, advising against the excessive consumption of aluminium due to its side effects, which include increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe release reads in part: \u201cIn everyday life, people mostly receive Aluminum into your body from food and drink consumption, especially those who drink water that has been diluted with potassium alum without controls of how much Aluminum is safe for your body. Drinking water that has high contamination of Aluminum can cause nauseating, diarrhoea and rash. Most importantly, Alziehmer\u2019s as Aluminum can damage nerve tissues.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
