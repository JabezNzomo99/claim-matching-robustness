{"title": "VERA FILES FACT CHECK: FB post red-tags Angel Locsin with UNSUPPORTED claims", "subtitle": "No news reports support either of its claims.", "author": "verafiles.org", "date": "Dec 3, 2020, 11:30 AM", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-62717", "url": "https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-fb-post-red-tags-angel-locsin-unsuppor", "vclaim": "A Facebook (FB) page that has a history of red-tagging made baseless claims linking actress Angel Locsin to the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People\u2019s Army (NPA).\n\nFB page Enlightened Youth\u2019s unfounded June 28 post claimed two things: that Locsin went to the Netherlands to \u201cget money\u201d from CPP founder Jose Maria Sison \u201cduring the last elections,\u201d and that she had a sibling who was a CPP-NPA member that died in a clash.\n\nNo news reports support either of these claims. A look at social media posts of the actress does not place her in Europe during the May 2019 polls, and her brother and sister are both alive. The two are in fact active social media users. Her sister Ella was among Kabataan Partylist\u2019s nominees for the 2007 elections.\n\nThe page also used irrelevant, out of context and photoshopped images to insinuate that the actress was a rebel sympathizer.\n\nThe post claimed the actress met with Sison in the European country \u201cwith the support of her uncle and his groups.\u201d\n\nWhile Enlightened Youth did not mention who her \u201cuncle\u201d was, it uploaded five photos, three of which show her campaigning during the 2016 elections with former Bayan Muna Rep. Neri Colmenares.\n\nOne image was an October 2015 Rappler photo of the actress accompanying Colmenares in filing his certificate of candidacy. The other image, uploaded twice, was grabbed from a now-unavailable tweet by an ABS-CBN News Channel reporter during the same event, a copy of which can be found on online forum PinoyExchange.\n\nLocsin is actually the aunt of Colmenares, not the other way around.\n\nA look at the actress\u2019 social media accounts showed she went to Belgium in June 2019 for an ABS-CBN event and Rome the following November, but no online post nor news report placed her in Europe during the May 2019 senatorial polls.\n\nDuring the election campaign period, Locsin\u2019s social media posts showed her in Baguio promoting her drama \u201cThe General\u2019s Daughter\u201d in March, while an Instagram post showed her and her fiance Neil Arce hiking in Bukidnon in April.\n\nApart from the photos with Colmenares, Enlightened Youth uploaded two images insinuating Locsin\u2019s \u201cconnections\u201d with the Left, showing a photo of her in a mountainous area and another photo featuring Kabataan Partylist Rep. Sarah Elago, activist Satur Ocampo and several others, also in a mountainous area.\n\nThe first image was grabbed from Locsin\u2019s June 25 Instagram post showing her doing preliminary research for her new ABS-CBN show \u201cIba \u2018Yan.\u201d\n\nThe photo showing Elago was over two years old, and unrelated to the actress. Its earliest copy online could be traced to website Arkibong Bayan PH and was taken in April 2018 during a fact-finding mission organized by Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas in Bukidnon.\n\nHowever, Enlightened Youth\u2019s version of the photo edited a hammer and sickle, the universal symbol of communism, onto Elago\u2019s bandana and superimposed a similar bandana to Ocampo\u2019s head.\n\nFive days after publishing its unfounded post, Enlightened Youth has provided no evidence to support its claims, despite promising an \u201cupdate\u201d in the comments section and saying it \u201cwas not its job\u201d to spread rumors.\n\nEnlightened Youth\u2019s unsupported post, which has been shared over 1,300 times, surfaced about three weeks after Locsin cried foul over Senate President Vicente Sotto III liking a tweet that said she was \u201cpro-NPA since day 1.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
