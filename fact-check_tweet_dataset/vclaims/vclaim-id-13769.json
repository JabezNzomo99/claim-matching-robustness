Following that step, people would accept forcible organ donation, genetically modified children, and mandatory sterilization:\n\nOnce the herd accepts mandatory forcible vaccination, it\u2019s game over! They will accept anything \u2014 forcible blood or organ donation \u2014 for the \u201cgreater good.\u201d We can genetically modify children and sterilize them \u2014 for the \u201cgreater good.\u201d Control sheep minds and you control the herd. Vaccine makers stand to make billions, and many of you in this room today are investors. It\u2019s a big win-win! We thin out the herd and the herd pays us for providing extermination services. Now, what\u2019s for lunch, huh?\n\nThe over-the-top nature of this putative Kissinger statement (particularly its concluding sentence) should be a strong indicator it\u2019s merely a fabrication. We find it unlikely that an experienced public speaker like Kissinger would use redundant adjectives (\u201cmandatory forcible vaccination\u201d), refer to the populace as a \u201cherd,\u201d or finish an address with the words \u201cNow, what\u2019s for lunch, huh?\u201d In no respect does it read like an excerpt from an actual speech.\n\nMore to the point, the passage comprises an incoherent jumble of outlandish claims that could only make sense to a conspiracy theorist, leaping from forcible vaccinations to genetically modifying and sterilizing children to \u201cproviding extermination services\u201d and \u201cthin[ning] out the herd.\u201d Our efforts to find any evidence at all that Henry Kissinger uttered these words, or that he took similar public positions on other occasions, were in vain.\n\nA \u201cWorld Health Organization Council on Eugenics\u201d does not exist, nor has such a body ever existed. The word \u201ceugenics\u201d has a long and sordid history, primarily as the name of a now-discredited social theory and movement from the early 20th century advocating the improvement of society by ensuring that people deemed genetically \u201csuperior\u201d reproduce at a higher rate than those identified as \u201cinferior.\u201d On the rare occasions when eugenics is discussed in World Health Organization (WHO) documents, it\u2019s in a historical context emphasizing that the practice served as a basis for the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany.\n\nKissinger is often portrayed as a kind of supervillain in the writings of conspiracy theorists, who have misquoted him before in the interests of identifying him with the alleged machinations of a secretive, elite cabal to rule the world. \u201cDepopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world,\u201d they\u2019ve quoted him as saying. The statement meshes well with the ersatz sentiments attributed to Kissinger above. When pressed, however, nobody seems to be able to specify where or when he ever made any such pronouncements.", "lang": "en"}
