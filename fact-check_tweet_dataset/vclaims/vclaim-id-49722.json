This is misleading; the incident happened in 2015 in Paris during a techno festival and is unrelated to politics.\n\n\n\n\"When YOU just wanted to deface a monument, BUT now someone needs to build one for YOU,\" the caption of the video published on July 13, 2020 reads.

Even though protests against police violence took place on the square in recent weeks, AFP found no reports that the statue of Marianne had been the target of any anger by demonstrators.\n\nHowever, other monuments, including one to 17th-century statesman Jean-Baptiste Colbert in front of the French parliament, sparked controversy in France. \n\n\n\nAlso Read: Did Black Lives Matter Protesters Assault A Priest In Washington DC?\n\nA Google reverse image search and keyword search showed that the incident in the video dates from 2015 during the 17th edition of Techno Parade, an annual music festival in the French capital.\n\nAFP reporting at the time said a man \"slipped\" and fatally fell from the top of the statue while climbing it.", "lang": "en"}
