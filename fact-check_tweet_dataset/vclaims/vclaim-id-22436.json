In the picture, Rathore can be seen holding a tray and interacting with players. The tray has three bowls on it, which acted as an affirmation for many that the minister was serving food to the players.\n\nThe Frustrated Indian posted the image on both Facebook and Twitter, captioning it as \u2013 \u201cthe dude holding the tray is our sports minister\u201d. It attracted a combined share count of nearly 6,000. They also wrote an article which said, \u201ca minister serving food to the players would have been unthinkable 5 years ago.\u201d The article has 1,500 shares.\n\nFake news website Postcard News founder Mahesh Hegde shared the image as well. It was retweeted over 900 times.\n\nBJP Telangana State President and MLA Dr K Laxman, BJP Karnataka MLA Raghupati Bhatt and AAP Delhi MLA Kapil Mishra also circulated the photograph with the identical claim. Mishra\u2019s tweet has been retweeted over 7,700 times.\n\nAmong the hoard of individual users who shared the image were also the ones followed by BJP leaders, including the Prime Minister and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office (1,2,3).\n\nA Facebook page India Firstshared the picture as part of a collage depicting \u201cnew India\u201d. The post had 12,000 shares at the time of writing this article. However, the claim was not limited to circulation by individual users, fake news purveyors and lawmakers. Several media outlets and journalists also praised Rathore for \u201cserving food.\u201d\n\nNDTV, DNA, Dainik Jagran, India TVand Republic Worldwere among the media outlets that wrote articles on the minister\u2019s alleged inspiring gesture. The image of him with the tray was the sole testament to the act and the basis of their reportage.\n\nSeveral journalists also praised the Sports Minister via tweets. Among them was Republic TV\u2019s Major Gaurav Arya, senior political editor of News18 Pallavi Joshi, Karnataka journalist Hariprakash Konemane and India Today\u2019s Rajdeep Sardesai. However, Sardesai later deleted his tweet.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe viral image was first shared from the official Twitter handle of Sports Authority of India (SAI) on August 26, along with several other pictures of the Sports Minister with athletes and officials at the Asian Games Village in Jakarta. However, SAI did not post the image with the claim that Rathore was \u201cserving\u201d the players.\n\nThe Sports Minister has also not claimed on social media or in media reports that he served food or tea to Indian athletes at the Games.\n\nThere are many other photographs of Rathore interacting with athletes that day. However, only the one where he is holding a tray is widely circulated. If one were to observe these photographs, the minister seems to be taking his own food.\n\nHowever, as this was an observational inference, Alt News contacted a person who was present at the scene but does not wish to be named. He told us that the picture is misleading as the minister was not serving food, snacks or tea but only greeting the players he met on his way to the table.\n\nIronically, ABP News Hindi, in its \u2018Viral Sach\u2019 program, aired a fact-check of the claim on August 28 and concluded that \u201cthe image was taken on August 27 and is true.\u201d Their analysis, which was sans any source, was incorrect as SAI shared the photograph on August 26. Moreover, we were able to independently confirm that Rathore was not serving food but only interacting with the athletes.\n\nA photograph of Rathore\u2019s interaction with athletes at Asian Games was hyperbolised to suggest that the minister was serving food to the players. The misleading claim was not only shared across social media platforms by individual users but also circulated by journalists, media outlets and ministers. Inferences on unauthenticated information are often made based on biases and not facts espousing the claim. A pedantic approach is necessary in such situations.", "lang": "en"}
