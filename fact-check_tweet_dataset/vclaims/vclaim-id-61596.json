But did Cruz set a record for service as the Lone Star State\u2019s chief litigator in state and federal appellate courts?\n\nWe first contacted the Texas attorney general's office to inquire about the individuals who have held the title of Texas solicitor general. We learned the post has only been around since , which would have coincided with John Cornyn, now the state\u2019s senior senator, getting sworn in for his term as attorney general.\n\nBefore that, the only other position in Texas government that resembled the role of solicitor general was called state solicitor, according to Renea Hicks, an Austin lawyer who formerly held the title. \"There was no office like solicitor general in the state up until 1994,\" Hicks said by phone. \"At that point, the attorney general created the position called state solicitor and that was me.\"\n\nHicks said instead of having a team of lawyers to work on appeals like the current solicitor general, he alone reviewed legal briefs and helped prepare appellate attorneys for court appearances. \"It hadn\u2019t grown into anything like the full-fledged division of what it is now,\" Hicks said.\n\nHicks said he served in the role for about year before leaving the AG\u2019s office, but no one formally replaced him until Cornyn established the Office of Solicitor General in 1999. \"He had liked the idea of someone in charge of appellate\" litigation \"for the state,\" Hicks said.\n\nSo Hicks had his year.\n\nAnd what about individuals later named solicitor general?\n\nA spokeswoman for the AG\u2019s office, Lauri Saathoff, emailed us the following list of Texas solicitors general:\n\nWe also checked these names in Who\u2019s Who, where we found that the years Coleman, Cruz and Ho served as solicitor general listed in the database matched the Saathoff's information.\n\nIn the cases of Parsley and Mitchell -- where the data in Who\u2019s Who was either incomplete or missing -- we checked online websites. The for Parsley\u2019s current law firm shows the attorney worked as solicitor general from August 2001 to November 2002. Meanwhile, Mitchell\u2019s at the University of Texas School of Law states the visiting professor was appointed to the position in 2010 and stepped down in January 2015.\n\nFalwell said Ted Cruz was \"the longest-serving solicitor general in the history of Texas.\"\n\nThat post has been around less than 20 years. Still, Cruz held it more than five years, longer than any of the lawyers who preceded and followed him and outpacing the second-longest holder by about a year.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
