Some on Twitter have also claimed this was the work of \u201cbots\u201d.\n\nThe post these supposedly suspicious tweets quote from was brought to prominence last week when a screenshot of it was shared by Alan Sugar on Twitter, but it had been circulating on Facebook before that. Other versions of the post had also appeared previously on Twitter too. \n\n\n\nThe most widely shared section of the post reads: \u201cJournalism is missing the \"mood\" in this great country of ours - the United Kingdom. We do not want or need blame. We do not want constant criticism of our Government who are doing their very best in a very difficult and unprecedented global emergency\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, copy and paste posts like these are unlikely to be bot activity. The accounts sharing this message have very little in common\u2014they were created at varying dates, have tweeted about different topics prior to sharing the tweet, and took different approaches to sharing the post\u2019s content, some just sharing one part of the post while others shared larger parts, or added their own opinions or feelings. Also, relatively few accounts are actually sharing the post on Twitter.\n\nThe original post these tweets quote from encourages people to share its sentiment, so it\u2019s likely people are just following this instruction.\n\nFirst Draft News\u2019s article on how to spot a bot is a helpful guide to whether something is legitimate bot activity.", "lang": "en"}
