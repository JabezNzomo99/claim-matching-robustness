The year the launch took place was 1963.\n\nThe second picture, that of former PM Indira Gandhi, along with Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka, sitting around a birthday cake is from 1977. This photo is indeed clicked on an aeroplane according to this Times Now article.\n\nDainik Bhaskar adds that this photo went viral on Rahul Gandhi's birthday last year.\n\nSo to say that our space scientists were managing with meagre resources while the Nehru-Gandhi family was celebrating a birthday on a plane is misleading as both the pictures are 14 years apart.", "lang": "en"}
