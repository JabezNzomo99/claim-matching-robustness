The claim is false. A reverse image search of the viral photo shared with the post was done using Yandex, which led to an article by Outlook.\n\n\"Braced for the worst Nehru is prevented from plunging into a riotous crowd in 1962, before the war,\" reads the caption of the photo. It is also mentioned that the photo is by the Associated Press (AP).\n\nIn the archive, it is mentioned that the picture was taken when a security man had grabbed Nehru to keep him from plunging into a riotous crowd at a meeting of the Congress Party in Patna, India, January 1962.\n\n\n\nFurther, the books mentioned in the posts as the source of information, \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0947\u0939 \u0917\u093e\u0925\u093e: \u090f\u0915 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0938\u0902\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0921\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0940 and \u0928\u0947\u0939\u0930\u0942 : \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928 \u0914\u0930 \u092a\u0924\u0928, could not be found. According to the website, Videh was a preacher of Vedic studies and yoga, and a founder of the organisation.\n\nThe same image was viral earlier with claim that Pandit Nehru was beaten up for 'his failure on China War'.
