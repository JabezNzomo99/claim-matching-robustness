Crediting NAN, news platforms including Premium Times and TheCable reported the \u201cstudy\u201d on Tuesday. Vanguard Newspaper, DailyPost, and many other web platforms have likewise shared the report in the same period.\n\nThe study is said to have been conducted over a five year period by \u201ca German scientist, Karen Weatherby, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine\u201d. The year it was published was not stated. After the scientist instructed 250 men to stare at breasts lustfully at least 10 minutes in a day and another group of 250 men to abstain from this, the report said, he concluded that the health of the first group of men improved significantly.\n\nThe study said men should stare at breasts for 10 minutes a day to improve the wellness of their hearts and to live longer.\n\n\u201cSexual excitement gets the heart pumping and improves blood circulation. Gazing at breasts makes men healthier and engaging in this activity a few minutes daily cuts the risk of stroke and heart attack by half,\u201d Weatherby was quoted to have said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that by doing so consistently, the average man can extend his life for four to five years.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report has been debunked as far back as in May 2000, by Snope, a prominent fact-checking website launched in 1994.\n\n\u201cThis has to be one of the ultimate male fantasies, second only to the notion that drinking beer and watching football makes one more intelligent. (Or maybe second only to the thought of being instructed by doctors to look at buxom women for five years straight, all in the name of science.),\u201d the website wrote sarcastically.\n\n\u201cWatching busty females may indeed be good for a man\u2019s health and add years to his life (by giving him something to look forward to, if nothing else), but men who want to make the case for engaging in this behaviour to their wives or girlfriends will have to do so without relying on the imprimatur of the medical community.\u201d\n\nSnopes further established that the study was never printed in the New England Journal of Medicine \u201cor any other major medical journal\u201d as claimed. It is, rather, a rephrased version of an article that has appeared at least twice (May 13, 1997, and March 21, 2000) on the Weekly World News, a popular tabloid that broke mostly fictional news in the United States between 1979 and 2007.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, \u201cThe Weekly World News was not one of those sleazy tabloids that cover tawdry celebrity scandals. It was a sleazy tabloid that covered events that seemed to occur in a parallel universe, a fevered dream world where pop culture mixed with urban legends, conspiracy theories and hallucinations. Maybe WWN played fast and loose with the facts, but somehow it captured the spirit of the age \u2014 and did it in headlines as perfect as haiku: \u2018DEAD ROCKSTARS RETURN ON GHOST PLANE!\u2019 \u2018BLIND MAN REGAINS SIGHT AND DUMPS UGLY WIFE!'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most creative newspaper in American history, the Weekly World News broke the story that Elvis faked his death and was living in Kalamazoo, Mich,\u201d Peter Carlson, the Post\u2019s staff writer, added.\n\n\u201cIt also broke the story that the lost continent of Atlantis was found near Buffalo. And the story that Hillary Clinton was having a love affair with P\u2019lod, an alien with a foot-long tongue. And countless other incredible scoops.\u201d\n\nSnopes said though the tabloid \u201coccasionally slips up and prints a true story\u201d, it suspects the report on the positive effects of breast-staring belongs in the category of similar articles titled \u201c\u2018HOW TO TELL IF YOUR DOG WORSHIPS SATAN!\u2019 and \u2018NEW REMOTE-CONTROL DEVICE GIVES WOMEN ORGASMS \u2014 AT UP TO 80 YARDS AWAY!'\u201d\n\nAnother fact-check of the claim published in 2009 (and updated in May 2019) by LiveAbout described it as an \u201cemail hoax circulating since March/April 2000\u201d and concluded that it is false.", "lang": "en"}
