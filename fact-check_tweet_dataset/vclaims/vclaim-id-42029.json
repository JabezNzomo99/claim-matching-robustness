Two shots are fired by the policemen following which two protesters fall to the ground. Security personnel then rush to the scene with a stretcher and appear to take away 'injured' protesters.\n\n\n\nThe video is being shared in wake of wide scale protests in the Northeast, particularly in Assam over the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Bill in both houses of parliament this week.\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing this fact-check, at least two protesters were killed in anti-citizenship bill demonstrations in Assam. However, the video (below) going viral is not related to the current protests.\n\nThe clip is being shared on closed messaging apps and social media with various captions in Assam.\n\nUsing InVid, a video verification tool, we broke the video into key frames and performed a reverse image search and found a similar video which was uploaded on November 1, 2017 stating that it was a mock drill by Jharkhand's Khunti Police.\n\nThe same video has also gone viral in the past with the false claim that it showed Madhya Pradesh police firing at farmers in Mandsaur.\n\n\n\nUsing similar keywords we found another video titled 'Jharkhand police KHUNTI (part of traning) REHEARSAL' uploaded on November 4, 2017, one can view the training exercise from a different angle and makes it clear that the action is a mock drill. \n\n\n\nRead a detailed debunk of the video here.", "lang": "en"}
