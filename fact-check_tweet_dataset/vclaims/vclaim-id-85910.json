Bush was returned to Britain?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T18:58:48Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85910", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/27/ted-cruzs-claim-that-one-of-obamas-very-first-acts-was-returning-a-bust-of-churchill/", "vclaim": "The Winston Churchill bust in question was originally provided in July 2001 by then Prime Minister Tony Blair as a loan to President George W. Bush. The bust, now almost 70 years old, was made by English sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein, and Bush said he would keep it in the Oval Office. Various news reports at the time said the bust will be returned once Bush left office.\n\nIn 2012, the Obama White House said the gift in 2001 occurred when the residence bust \u201cwas being worked on at the time\u201d but The Fact Checker did not find a reference to that in news reports. Still, at the news conference accepting the gift, Bush told reporters it came about because he lamented to the British ambassador that \u201cthat there was not a proper bust of Winston Churchill for me to put in the Oval Office.\u201d So one could wonder why the president would say that when he already had virtually the same bust sitting in the residence.\n\nWhen Obama took office, the Epstein bust loaned by Blair was returned to the British government, and the U.K. ambassador installed it in his residence. According to a 2010 interview with White House curator William Allman, the decision to return the bust had been made even before Obama arrived, as the loan was only scheduled to last as long as Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut the British press, always eager for any sign of rockiness in the U.S.-British relationship, had a field day with the return of the bust. \u201cThe rejection of the bust has left some British officials nervously reading the runes to see how much influence the UK can wield with the new regime in Washington,\u201d reported The Telegraph in an article subtitled, \u201cBarack Obama has sent Sir Winston Churchill packing and pulse rates soaring among anxious British diplomats.\u201d\n\nThe British media even speculated, without evidence, that Obama returned the bust because he is half-Kenyan and so he might have been upset by Churchill\u2019s decision to send troops to Kenya in 1952 to crush the Mau Mau uprising. (Historian David Anderson later told Salon this was \u201cstir fry crazy\u201d because there was no Mau Mau rebellion where the Obama family lived. \u201cThe Obama family come from western Kenya, which is about as different from Nairobi and the Kikuyu area as Utah is from New York City,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s almost as far away.\u201d)\n\nCompounding the confusion, in 2012 White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer published a so-called \u201cfact check\u201d on the matter when our colleague Charles Krauthammer mentioned the return of the bust in a column. But Pfeiffer confused the two busts, initially claiming that the bust in the residence was the same one that Blair had loaned to Bush. (He even cited two U.S. news reports, in the National Journal and the Associated Press, saying the same thing.)\n\nOops. When the British government explained that the Blair bust had been returned, Pfeiffer, with egg on his face, issued an apology to Krauthammer. \u201cThe bust that was returned as a matter of course with all the other artwork that had been loaned to President Bush for display in his Oval Office and not something that President Obama or his Administration chose to do,\u201d he added.\n\nCruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said \u201cthe point is that Great Britain offered to extend the loan of the bust at the end of the George W. Bush administration, and the administration rejected the offer and returned the bust.\u201d She added that \u201cwe stand by what the senator has said,\u201d and noted that the White House did not ask for it back after the controversy erupted.\n\nUpdate, April 22, 2016: Questioned about the issue during a visit to London, Obama for the first time admitted that he decided to remove the bust to make room for one of Martin Luther King Jr: \u201cI thought it was appropriate, and I suspect most people here in the United Kingdom might agree, that as the first African American President, it might be appropriate to have a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King in my office to remind me of all the hard work of a lot of people who would somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
