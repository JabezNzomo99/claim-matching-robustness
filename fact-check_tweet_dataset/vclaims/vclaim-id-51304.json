Mike Defensor on the denial of ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise bid.\n\nIn a July 13 interview on ANC, Defensor defended his and the House franchise committee's decision that \"killed\" the franchise renewal of ABS-CBN. He said:\n\nDefensor echoed the findings of the technical working group (TWG) report, which argued that ABS-CBN\u2019s \u201cmechanism of corporate layering...makes the PDR holders indirect owners of the underlying shares of stock of ABS-CBN,\u201d and thus violates Sec. 11, Article XVI of the Constitution banning foreign ownership of mass media entities.\n\nIssuing PDRs to foreigners does not grant them actual ownership of a company or corporation.\n\nPDRs are forms of securities that grant holders the right to the delivery of sale of underlying shares. They are, however, \u201cnot evidences [sic] or statements nor certificates of ownership of a corporation,\u201d according to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).\n\nSecurities are \u201cshares, participation or interests\u201d in a corporation, commercial enterprise or profit-making venture, \u201cevidenced by a certificate, contract [or] instrument,\u201d as defined by the PSE.\n\nLawyer Romel Bagares, in a 2017 interview with VERA Files, said PDRs are \u201cinvestment tools\u201d devised by businesses and lawyers to factor in foreign investors without violating the Constitution. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Three things Duterte got wrong about Rappler, VERA FILES FACT CHECK: SEC revocation of Rappler\u2019s registration explained)\n\nBy investing, PDR holders get a share in the profits of the company but have \u201cno control\u201d in the day-to-day operations, no representation in the board, nor can they decide on policy, Bagares then said.\n\nHowever, the House committee\u2019s TWG report asserted that the pledge agreement securing PDRs to holders restricts ABS-CBN Holdings\u2019 right to dispose of underlying shares, thus compromising full ownership.\n\nSolicitor General Jose Calida cited the same issue with foreign ownership in a quo warranto petition filed before the Supreme Court (SC) on Feb. 10, seeking to nullify the media giant\u2019s now-expired legislative franchise. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: SolGen\u2019s claim that ABS-CBN \u2018violated\u2019 foreign ownership restriction needs context)\n\nBagares, in an interview in February following Calida\u2019s petition, further explained that ABS-CBN\u2019s PDRs, which are publicly listed on the PSE, \u201cdon\u2019t give voting rights but only cash or stock dividends.\u201d\n\nThe SC junked Calida\u2019s plea on June 23 -- over a month after the network\u2019s franchise expired on May 4 -- noting that the issue has become \"moot and academic.\"\n\nThe network has maintained throughout the marathon franchise hearings that ABS-CBN Holdings' PDRs have been \"evaluated and approved by the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)] and the [PSE].\" (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: What\u2019s next for ABS-CBN after losing franchise bid)\n\nSEC Commissioner Ephyro Luis Amatong said in a Senate hearing on the network\u2019s franchise renewal led by the committee on public services on Feb. 24 that ABS-CBN had \u201cno pending violations\u201d with the commission.\n\nAmatong reiterated this in the June 11 joint hearing of the House committees on legislative franchises and on good government and public accountability:\n\nOther broadcast companies, such as GMA Network, Inc., also use PDRs to raise capital for the improvement of their services.\n\nABS-CBN is owned by ABS-CBN Corporation, the country\u2019s biggest media conglomerate, which is part of Lopez, Incorporated, an investment company owned by the family of the late Eugenio Lopez Sr. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Gabby Lopez still HAS shares in ABS-CBN Corporation)\n\nEditor's note: This fact check was produced by a student from the University of the Philippines Diliman who is doing her internship with VERA Files.\n\n\n\nANC 24/7, Rep.
