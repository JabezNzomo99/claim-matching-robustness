The NHPS aims to reduce private out of pocket medical spending, which is currently around 60 percent of all healthcare expenses. And while the scheme has been hailed as 'historic' several questions have been raised about how the world's largest healthcare scheme will work. Sensing the apprehension around the scheme, the health ministry and NITI Aayog were quick in responding and held a press conference on Friday.\n\nBelow is a list of questions that have been answered based on what the government has said so far and based on publicly available data.\n\nWhat is the National Health Protection Scheme?\n\nIt is a nationwide health insurance scheme that would cover 10 crore poor and vulnerable families by providing an insurance coverage of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary hospitalization. It aims to benefit around 50 crore people.\n\nWho will benefit from the scheme?\n\n10 crore families identified as poor vulnerable in the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 shall be eligible under the insurance scheme.\n\nIs it a new scheme?\n\nNo. National Health Protection Scheme was introduced in union budget 2017 but with a coverage of Rs. 1 lakh per family per year.\n\nHowever, the scheme was still pending in the cabinet and did not take off. \u2018The contours of the scheme are yet to be finalized\u2019, the health ministry had said replying to a Lok Sabha Question dated December 17, 2017.\n\nThe centre was already running a health insurance scheme called the Rashtriya Swasthya Bhima Yojana introduced in 2008 which was renamed to Rashtriya Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (RSSY) in 2016-17. In the following budget (2017-18), the National Health Protection scheme was announced with a higher coverage. But it did not materialize and RSBY continued.\n\nUnder RSBY, BPL families are provided an annual insurance coverage of Rs. 30,000 and around 3.6 crore families were enrolled under RSBY in 2017-18 (up to September 2017). The government pays the premium of Rs. 500 per family per year under RSBY.\n\nOnce NHPS launches RSBY will subsume in NHPS, according to Niti Aayog.\n\nWhat will be the premium amount and who will pay it?\n\nThe estimated premium is between Rs. 1000 \u2013 Rs. 1200, according to Alok Kumar, Niti Aayog member. This is to be paid by the government and thus shall be free of cost to the beneficiaries. In case of 100% active enrollment, the annual fund required for premium shall be between Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 12,000 crore.\n\nWhat is the fund allocated to the scheme?\n\nThe union budget 2018 has made available Rs. 2000 crore for NHPS which is currently allocated under the Rashtriya Swasthya Bhima Yojana.\n\nIs this fund enough to reach out to 10 crore families?\n\nThis fund is just the initial fund allocated to the scheme as per budget estimate 2018-19. In addition to this, Rs 11,000 crore shall be at the disposal for the scheme from the health and education cess levied along with personal and corporate income tax, according to NITI Aayog. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley proposed 4% health and education cess in 2018-19 as opposed to 3% of education cess in 2017-18.\n\nMoreover, the burden of funding is not on the centre alone. Health expenditure is borne at the ratio of 60:40 by the centre and states. Thus, only 60% of the funding shall come from the centre which is estimated at Rs 6000 crore for the premium amount of Rs 1000 per family, according to Niti Aayog.\n\nHow does Niti Aayog plan to roll out NHPS?\n\nJP Nadda, Minister of Health and Family Welfare, and the Niti Aayog reiterated that this scheme shall not be stalled due to financial constraints and that implementation is key.\n\nEveryone listed in SECC survey list are enrolled in the scheme by default. However, they need to be made aware of the scheme.\n\nAs health is a state subject, states have to decide whether to roll out this scheme or not. As of now only 14 states have rolled out RSBY and some run their own health insurance schemes. So, it is upon states whether to run their own health insurance schemes or subsume them with NHPS. The health minister pointed out that NHPS shall provide the highest coverage of Rs 5 lakh compared to any of the existing centre / state sponsored health insurance schemes.\n\nIf the states choose to uptake NHPS, then again it has a choice to run it as a trust model or insurance company model. If run by the latter, the company that wins the bid will run the scheme in a state. However, the Niti Aayog has recommended the trust mode over the insurance company mode.\n\nWhen will the scheme be rolled out?\n\nThe scheme is to be launched by October 2nd, according to media reports. The centre is yet to discuss the scheme with states, enroll hospitals and finalize health packages.\n\nNo. Though the people in SECC list are already enrolled, active enrollment depends on awareness generated and the decision of the states to run it or not.\n\nWhat are the special features of NHPS?\n\u2022 There is no cap on the family size which means that whatever the size, the family will get a coverage of Rs. 5 lakh per year.\n\u2022 This is paperless, cashless, Aadhaar linked but patients without Aadhaar will not be denied treatment, Niti Aayog has said.\n\u2022 It is envisioned to be a national scheme in which the beneficiaries\u2019 will be able to claim insurance for treatment in hospitals listed under the scheme across the country.\n\u2022 A national health agency shall be established to oversee the scheme.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of the story incorrectly stated 50,000 crore instead of 50 crore as beneficiaries of the scheme. The error is regretted.", "lang": "en"}
