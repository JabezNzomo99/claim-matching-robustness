Accompanied by a dramatic photograph of a massive chasm in an urban center, the Geographic article reported:\n\nHuman activity, not nature, was the likely cause of the gaping sinkhole that opened up in the streets of Guatemala City on Sunday, a geologist says. A burst sewer pipe or storm drain probably hollowed out the underground cavity that allowed the chasm to form, according to Sam Bonis, a geologist at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, who is currently living in Guatemala City (map). The Guatemala City sinkhole, estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) wide and 300 feet (100 meters) deep, appears to have been triggered by the deluge from tropical storm Agatha. But the cavity formed in the first place because the city\u2014and its underground infrastructure\u2014were built in a region where the first few hundred meters of ground are mostly made up of a material called pumice fill, deposited during past volcanic eruptions.\n\nThe crater formed in the center of an intersection, and perhaps because aerial photographs are so visually striking, they have been shared throughout the years since the event occurred:\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the first time a massive sinkhole opened up in Guatemala City. A similar, deadly event took place in 2007, resulting from a combination of geography, nature, and poor regulation according to National Geographic.\n\nGuatemala City is situated on volcanic material that is relatively loosely-composed. That placement, combined with swift-running water from unfixed underground leaks, contributed to formation of the craters\n\n\u201cIn Guatemala City [the pumice is] unconsolidated, it\u2019s loose,\u201d Dartmouth geologist Sam Bonis told the Geographic in 2010. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been hardened into a rock yet, so it\u2019s easily eroded, especially by swift running water.\u201d Tropical storm Agatha, coupled with leaking sewage pipes, likely triggered the collapse in 2010.\n\nBonis added that because the event wasn\u2019t driven by natural forces, it technically shouldn\u2019t be called a \u201csinkhole.\u201d There was no scientific term, he said, to describe this type of collapse.", "lang": "en"}
