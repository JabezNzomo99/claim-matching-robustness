In many cases these manipulated photographs depict people in imminent danger from large, dangerous, scary animals, such as widely-circulated images of a hapless parachutist about to descend into a lake surrounded by alligators, or scuba divers (both military and civilian) who are shown as being mere seconds away from becoming a shark\u2019s next meal.\n\nA popular online image is of similar ilk, seemingly showing a kayaker in Sitka, Alaska, scooting across the gaping, soon-to-be-gulping jaw of a humpback whale:\n\nThis story/photo is from Dr. Kraft who is a physician in Sitka. Wow, what are the chances of taking this picture just at this moment: Yep, that is me in the picture. Yep that is a whale that was just around the corner from the ferry terminal. \u201cPaddle really fast\u201d is the only thing I could think of at the time. Also thinking that I don\u2019t look like a herring, don\u2019t smell like a herring but with the same herring instinct of \u201cget the hell out of the way of that big mouth!!\u201d Still living to tell yet another story\u2026\n\nLike many such images, this is a manufactured phony, a jape created by merging two photographs taken at different times and places:\n\nOne interesting difference in this case is that the whale/kayak composite was not created by some anonymous Internet prankster, but by the original photographer himself, Tim Shobe, who explained how he came to create it:\n\nBeing bored one night and looking through my images, I came across some photos of whales that I took and then one of my friend Richard from here in Sitka while he was in his kayak. These two images were from two completely different times and locations (roughly 3 months apart). I came up with the idea to create a manipulated image with the help of Photoshop to use as a small piece of entertainment for a few of my friends on my email list. The whale image of mine that I used for this piece was one of many captured during a day in which I blessed to have witnessed several humpback whales bubblenetting and lunge feeding.\n\nA March 2010 article in the Daily Sitka Sentinel detailed how the composite was set loose and spread via the Internet:\n\nSitkan Tim Shobe is known for taking photos so good they\u2019re \u201cunbelievable.\u201d But none is quite so unbelievable as the one he took of his friend Rich Kraft paddling through the mouth of a bubble-feeding humpback. The photo of the humpback is real, and so is the one of Kraft. But the two together? Not real. \u201cHe sent it to me, and I showed it around work,\u201d said Kraft, who is a physician at SEARHC-Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital. The image included a quip about Kraft conducting an oral exam. \u201cIt was just a picture to get a chuckle,\u201d Kraft said. He thought his friends would enjoy Shobe\u2019s photographic and PhotoShop skills \u2014 and the joke \u2014 and sent it along to a few people. But in the world of the Internet, such things take on a life of their own. Before Kraft knew it, the photo had come back to him after reaching several other people. The question was always: \u201cIs this real?\u201d The photo of him in the kayak was taken last winter, when he and Shobe were out kayaking near the ferry terminal. The photo of the whale was taken two weeks ago in Nakwasina Sound. Shobe said he was surprised not only that people took the photo at face value, but also at the wide distribution of his PhotoShopped image.\n\nThe same image resurfaced in July 2016, with some small changes: Kraft was a dentist rather than a physician, and the picture was credited to someone named Mark Tennant.", "lang": "en"}
