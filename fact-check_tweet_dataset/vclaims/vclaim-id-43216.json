Hence, I thought of greeting you all and I request you all to not take the virus as a joke. This is a virus, not a joke. My health today is way better.\u201d The man urges people to take precautions against the coronavirus pandemic. Several users have claimed that he is Dr Usama Riaz who caught the viral infection while treating patients suffering from COVID-19 and lost his life. The video is claimed to be the last message left by the doctor.\n\nTweets by Khadija Siddiqi and Aarif Shah alleging that he is Dr Usama Riaz have garnered a combined retweet count of over 5,000. The video is viral on Twitter and Facebook with the same narrative.\n\nSonam Mahajan, a prominent social media user, tweeted the video with the message, \u201cThis is Dr. Usama Riaz from Pakistan. He got infected with coronavirus while treating others. This was his last video cuz he succumbed yesterday.\u201d\n\nFacebook user Kajla Sunil Choudhary posted the video claiming that he a coronavirus patient from Rajasthan\u2019s Bhilwara. His message reads, \u201c\u092d\u0940\u0932\u0935\u093e\u095c\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0915\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0949\u091c\u093f\u091f\u093f\u0935 \u0921\u0949. \u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e\u091c \u0938\u093e\u0939\u092c \u0915\u093e \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0936 (A message for the public by Niyaz Sahab, a COVID-19 positive patient from Bhilwara.)\u201d The post has been shared more than 1,700 times.\n\nFirstly, it is true that a 26-year-old doctor died in Pakistan due to contracting coronavirus while treating patients. His name was indeed Riaz. He was treating people in POK\u2019s Gilgit-Baltistan region who had returned from Iraq and Iran.\n\nBut the second and most important fact is that the man in the video is not the same doctor. He is doctor Mubashir Ahmad, who is from Pakistan and has been living in the United Kingdom for some time. He did contract the virus. His relative Nimra informed that he (Ahmad) is her uncle and his name is not Usama Riaz. She further stated that her uncle is fine and recuperating.\n\nWe found Ahmad\u2019s Facebook profile and subsequently a post where he clarifies that he is not Dr Usama Riaz. While thanking God, Ahmad said that he is feeling much better but he is in the hospital at the moment. Posted below is the screenshot of his Facebook post. In the post, he talks about his video circulating with different people\u2019s names which shouldn\u2019t have happened and is wrong.\n\nHe also posted a live video clarification where he referred to himself as Dr Mubashir Ahmad.\n\nThe video viral on social media with false claims is a Facebook live which was posted by Ahmad on March 22, 2020.\n\nAlt News could ascertain that a video of Dr Mubashir Ahmad was shared on social media with the claim that he is doctor Usama Riaz who died after contracting the coronavirus. In the comparison posted below, Ahmad is on the left while Usama is on the rights.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India has exceeded 600. This has caused the government to impose a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services. Globally, more than 4 lakh confirmed cases and close to 21,000 deaths have been reported. There is a growing sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a global pandemic, can take lives.
