After conducting reconnaissance...two planes of the Russian Air-Space forces and two planes of the international coalition forces conducted airstrikes against terrorist objectives.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s Sputnik web site said that \u201cRussia has received coordinates of Daesh (IS) targets in al-Bab, Aleppo province, from the U.S. via the 'direct line,' the Russian Defense Ministry said Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense is not coordinating airstrikes with the Russian military in Syria,\u201d U.S. Major Adrian J.T. Rankine-Galloway, the Pentagon press representative, told Voice of America via email.\n\nRankine-Galloway said that the channel of communication the U.S. Department of Defense maintains with the Russian military is \u201cfocused solely on ensuring the safety of aircrews and de-confliction of coalition and Russian operations in Syria.\u201d\n\nA day later, Sputnik \u2013 while not backing down on its claims that Russia received coordinates from the U.S. \u2013 reported \u201ctwo Su-24Ms and a Su-34 bomber, as well as two Turkey's F-16 and two F-4 participated in the aerial campaign.\u201d\n\nA check by Polygraph.info of Russian and Turkish media found reports of strikes by Russian and Turkish jets on several dozen IS targets in and around al-Bab, which began escalating on January 18.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, \u201cdefense contractor Daniel Trombly tweeted that Russian sources claim the Kremlin's jets flew with Turkish aircraft over Syria. And Russia and Turkey have previously carried out joint-operations in al-Bab outside of the U.S.-led coalition.\u201d\n\nSamuel Oakford, a contributor to the independent conflict observation watchdog Airwars, told Polygraph.info that there is a \u201cgrey area\u201d when it comes to Russia\u2019s cooperation with Turkey on airstrikes in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cAnkara has already coordinated with the Russians recently to support their Euphrates Shield operation,\u201d he said, referring to a Turkey-led offensive on IS and Syrian Kurdish forces in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cThat operation is not an official U.S.-led coalition activity,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the U.S. has provided some limited strikes, ostensibly to support Turkish forces\".\n\n\u201cThe Russians could be stretching the truth a bit,\u201d Oakford said. \u201cTurkey is flying there and is nominally part of the coalition. But there appears to be no way that they received coordinates from coalition headquarters. The coalition and USG deny that.\u201d\n\nAs to whether U.S. forces may someday partner with the Russian military in the fight against IS, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said: \u201cI think if there\u2019s a way that we can combat IS with any country, whether it\u2019s Russia or anyone else, and we have a shared national interest in that, sure we\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nBut some key Congressional Republicans, such as Sen. John McCain (R, Az), have expressed opposition to joint operations with Russia.\n\n\"I would be deeply disturbed if such a thing happened,\" McCain told CNN.", "lang": "en"}
