Glenn Chong, the \"fearless lawyer\" referred to in the headline, who was a resource person in the Senate hearing.\n\nChong's credibility was questioned by Sen. Franklin Drilon, after two letters showed he was a representative of vice presidential candidate Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.\n\nThe Daily Sentry's false story could have reached over 2.4 million people, its biggest traffic generators being the Facebook page of Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission spokesperson Greco Belgica, The Filipino News and News Wire PH.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
