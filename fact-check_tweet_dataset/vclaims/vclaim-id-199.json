While the installation is genuine, it does not commemorate the Welsh victims of the coronavirus.\n\nPembroke Castle told Reuters the display was originally created for St David\u2019s Day \u2013 a celebration for the patron saint of Wales, St David - and has nothing to do with the pandemic.\n\nA photograph of the same installation was uploaded to castle\u2019s website on March 3. The webpage explains the display is called \u201cMarch of the Daffodils\u201d and was commissioned to celebrate \u201cthe joy of being Welsh on St.David\u2019s Day\u201d, which is on March 1 (here).\n\nAlthough the social media post claims the daffodils honour \u201cthe 500 Welsh victims\u201d of the disease, it wasn\u2019t until March 16 that the first COVID-19 death was reported in Wales, several weeks after the installation was completed (here).\n\nAccording to Public Health Wales, 788 people were suspected to have died of COVID-19 in Wales as of April 26, 2020, out of more than 9000 confirmed cases ( here!/vizhome/RapidCOVID-19virology-Public/Headlinesummary ).\n\nFalse: the Pembroke Castle daffodil installation was in fact commissioned to celebrate St. David\u2019s Day on March 1, two weeks before the first coronavirus death in Wales.", "lang": "en"}
