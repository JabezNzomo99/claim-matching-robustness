Author Lori Gallagher Witt wrote it in January 2018.\n\nThe viral Facebook post lists 16 beliefs allegedly held by the \u201cmajority of liberals\u201d that Howard knows on political issues such as immigration, health care, taxation and social programs. It also includes an accompanying photo of Howard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a liberal, but that doesn\u2019t mean what a lot of you apparently think it does,\u201d reads the introduction of the essay. \u201cLet\u2019s break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I\u2019m getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for.\u201d (RELATED: Did Charlie Daniels Say, \u2018Voting For Trump Is Like Playing Country Music Backwards\u2019?)\n\nBut Howard did not author the open letter. A search of the filmmaker\u2019s verified social media accounts did not yield any results for the essay. Nor did an internet search turn up any credible sources attributing the essay to him.\n\nThe open letter, debunked by several fact-checking websites, was actually written by Witt. Her Facebook post, which only contained 15 beliefs, has been shared over 25,000 times since she posted it on Jan. 7, 2018. It includes a copyright notice and the words \u201cFeel free to share, but please give me credit, and if you add or change anything, please note accordingly.\u201d\n\nWitt told Reuters that the misattribution to Howard started in January 2020, after a man with the same name as the filmmaker posted her words without properly citing her. People posted it \u201cas originating from THE Ron Howard, and it went wild from there,\u201d Witt said, according to Reuters.\n\nWhile Howard did not write the open letter, he has spoken publicly about his political beliefs in the past. In 2016, he tweeted that he has voted for both parties but planned to vote for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.", "lang": "en"}
