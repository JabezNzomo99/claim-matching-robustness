The building is an office block in Manchester, not a hospital in Belfast. And the bollards are removable.\n\nA number of much shared Facebook posts claim \u201cThese workmen are just finished installing cast-iron bollards to stop people from parking on the pavement outside the Royal Hospital in Belfast. They are cleaning up at the end of the day. If you can spot why they\u2019re not going home hit share, and don\u2019t say!\u201d\n\nThe image in these humour Facebook posts frequently appears in memes and Facebook posts. The location varies. This well shared version claims that the workmen are installing bollards outside \u201cthe Royal Hospital in Belfast\u201d.\n\nTechnically, there is no \u201cRoyal Hospital in Belfast\u201d. The Royal Victoria Hospital is one of four linked hospitals that makes up Northern Ireland\u2019s largest hospitals site. The other hospitals are Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, Royal Dental Hospital and Royal Jubilee Maternity Service.\n\nThe building featured in the Facebook post is not on the Royal site. It\u2019s neither in Belfast nor a hospital. Instead, this is an office building, Astley House, 23 Quay Street, Manchester. You can read more about the building on this webpage.\n\nHow do we know this?\n\nBy dragging an image into Google Image search running in another browser tab can help identify other websites and pages on which it has been used, often providing clues to the veracity of the information about its location. In this case, a prominent image search result is a link to the Snopes website, which explains that the bollards in the photograph are of a type that can be removed by inserting a key, twisting the bollard, and lifting them out of their socket base.\n\nSo, the workers are neither trapped nor in Belfast!\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
