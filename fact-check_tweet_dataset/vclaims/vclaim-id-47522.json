This ban, according to the reports, is to commence on Friday, May 1.\n\nThe claim is said to be a directive from President Nana Akufo-Addo sent through a letter to the National Media Commission (NMC).\n\nThe National Media Commission (NMC) is a media regulatory institution responsible for registering, regulating and monitoring media activities in Ghana. As such, the Commission has oversight responsibility for the media and its contents. It is, therefore, not far-fetched that this claim is attributed to the commission.\n\nIn reaction, the NMC, however, says the news is fake. A press release issued on April 30 and signed by the Executive Secretary of the Commission, George Sarpong, stated that no such directive was given by his agency.\n\nAccording to the press release, the constitution insulates the Commission from interference or control by government and other bodies in the performance of its functions. Therefore, it would be \u201cunconstitutional\u201d for the president to give such a directive to the commission.\n\nAdditionally, Mr Sarpong stated that the Commission\u2019s Guidelines on Religious Broadcasting does not contain any provision empowering the agency to ban religious personalities from broadcasting on television.\n\nThe NMC has not been directed by the president to ban the religious broadcasts of \u2018fetish priests\u2019 and \u2018mallams\u2019 on television. Citizens are advised to disregard this piece of fake news.\n\nRoselena Ahiable is a Senior Researcher with Dubawa Ghana.
