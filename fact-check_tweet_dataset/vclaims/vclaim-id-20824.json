The statement said North Korea (officially the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) committed to \u201cwork towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d The phrase is not defined and \u201ctoward\u201d is rather weak. In the past, North Korea viewed \u201cdenuclearization\u201d to mean the United States removing the nuclear umbrella it provides to Japan and South Korea; there is no indication its definition has changed.\n\n\u201cThe approach suggested here is based on our belief that North Korea will not give up its weapons and its weapons program until its security can be assured,\u201d the report said. \u201cSuch assurance cannot be achieved simply by an American promise or an agreement on paper, it will require a substantial period of coexistence and interdependence.\u201d The report noted that \u201cNorth Korea has covert facilities that it is unlikely to declare and eliminate initially\u201d and that \u201cthe financial costs of each of the steps must be analyzed and anticipated.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
