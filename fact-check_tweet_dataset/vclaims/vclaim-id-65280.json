One of his prime examples -- Clinton\u2019s full-throated support for the attacks that toppled Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi.\n\nBut in a NBC News forum focused on the role of the commander-in-chief, Clinton deflected that criticism. She said there was no difference between herself and Trump on the Libyan action.\n\n\"He's on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population,\" Clinton said Sept. 7, 2016.\n\nDid Trump endorse the attacks to unseat Libya\u2019s then-leader, Moammar Gadhafi?\n\nThe record shows he did.\n\nEarly in 2011, before the United States joined a NATO force to oust Gadhafi, Trump argued for American action. We know what Trump thought back then thanks to a video on Trump\u2019s own video blog (credit to BuzzFeed for spotting it)\n\n\"I can\u2019t believe what our country is doing,\" Trump said, according to the BuzzFeed transcript. \"Gadhafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we\u2019re sitting around. We have soldiers all over the Middle East, and we\u2019re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that\u2019s what it is: It\u2019s a carnage.\"\n\n\"You talk about things that have happened in history; this could be one of the worst,\" he said. \"Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We don\u2019t want to get involved and you\u2019re gonna end up with something like you\u2019ve never seen before.\"\n\n\"But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals,\" Trump said. \"It\u2019s horrible what\u2019s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives.\"\n\nTrump offered a more mixed assessment on CNN after the attacks began. His primary concern was with the political leanings of the forces opposing Gadhafi.\n\n\"I do really want to know who these people we're fighting for, who they are,\" Trump said on March 28, 2011. \"I hear they are aligned with Iran. I hear they may be aligned with al-Qaida.\"\n\nBut Trump still said, \"At this point, if you don't get rid of Gadhafi, it's a major, major black eye for this country.\"\n\nClinton said Trump is on record \"extensively\" supporting the attacks that unseated Libya\u2019s Gadhafi. We actually didn\u2019t find that many comments from Trump about Libya. But when he did speak, he was emphatic. In 2011, before the first bombing runs, Trump said, \"We should go in, we should stop this guy.\"\n\nEven when he voiced concern over who would run Libya post-Gadhafi, he supported the intervention.", "lang": "en"}
