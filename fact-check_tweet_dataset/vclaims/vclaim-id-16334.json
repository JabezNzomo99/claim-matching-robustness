Instead of booking an initial face-to-face appointment or receiving an initial call from a nurse, patients are called by a GP who carries out an initial consultation over the phone.\n\nThe approach isn\u2019t completely unusual: 12% of GP consultations take place over the phone, according to a 2014 study published in the Lancet medical journal. The idea is to prioritise face-to-face appointments with patients who seem to need help most urgently, and to avoid unnecessary ones. Feedback from surgeries that have tried this approach suggests that many patients are actually quite happy to receive quick advice over the phone instead of coming in to the surgery.\n\nSo the approach isn\u2019t designed to cruelly ration access to GPs. People have a right to register with an NHS surgery and a right to treatment by a GP at that surgery. GP Access and Productive Primary Healthcare, two firms that promote telephone triage systems, told us that they had never heard of a case where a GP refused a face-to-face appointment when the patient asked for one during the telephone call.\n\nThe Mail\u2019s story also refers to \u201cthree-minute phone assessments\u201d. Productive Primary Healthcare told us that three minutes was the average length of a call once surgeries had implemented their system, but stressed that it doesn\u2019t advise that calls be a particular length or have a time limit. GP Access said the same, although it bases its training for surgeries on an average call length of five minutes.\n\nOf course, none of this guarantees that some patients don\u2019t feel \u2018fobbed off\u2019 by telephone consultations, as campaigners quoted by the Mail put it, or that there aren\u2019t legitimate concerns about patient safety and quality of care. Sir Denis Pereira Gray, former President of the Royal College of GPs, has raised concerns that GPs will miss important visual clues that patients are unwell if they don\u2019t see them face-to-face, particularly when it comes to vulnerable and elderly patients.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear that the scheme either saves time for GPs or generates cost savings for the NHS overall. The largest study we\u2019ve seen found that \u2018telephone triage\u2019 actually increased GP workloads, in contrast to previous research, since they ended up spending more time on the phone. Patients who were given telephone consultations were more likely to call back or have other contact with the NHS again over the next 28 days, so:\n\nAnd since patients were more likely to have further appointments, the study found that the average overall cost to primary care services from \u2018telephone triage\u2019 with a GP, \u2018telephone triage\u2019 with a nurse, or an initial face-to-face appointment was roughly the same.\n\nGP Access has raised concerns about this study. It said that it didn't reflect how GP telephone triage services can be used most effectively, and it published a point-by-point comparison which outlined the differences between its own work and use of GP telephone triage in the study.\n\nAn independent evaluation of the Prime Minister's GP Access Fund, a government fund to help improve access to GP services, found that:\n\nAnother independent study into the use of GP telephone triage is due to report its findings in March.\n\nThis article was updated shortly after publication to reflect GP Access' concerns about the ESTEEM study, and to include the independent evaluation of the Prime Minister's GP Access Fund.", "lang": "en"}
