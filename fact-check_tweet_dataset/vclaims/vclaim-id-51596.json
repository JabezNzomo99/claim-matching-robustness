It is being claimed that amid the coronavirus pandemic, Facebook has changed its privacy rules. It further claims that the social media platform is allowing it to use posts shared by users in lawsuits against them. Vishvas News had earlier investigated the post and found it to be fake.\n\nThe post has resurfaced on social media and has been shared by a user named Tammy Mccoy on Facebook. It reads: \u201c\u201cIn the confusion around Covid 19, and just in case this is true. Don\u2019t forget that tomorrow starts the new Facebook rule that our photos can be used. Remember the deadline is today. They can be used in lawsuits against us. Everything we posted today goes public, even messages deleted. It takes nothing to make a simple copy and paste: better safe than sorry. \u201cI don\u2019t allow Facebook or any Facebook training to use my photos, information, messages or posts, either from the past or in the future\u201d. With this statement, I give a notification to Facebook that it is strictly forbidden to reveal, copy, distribute or take other actions against me based on this profile and / or its contents. The content of this profile is private and confidential information. The violation of my personal life can be punished by law. Note: \u201cFacebook\u201d is now a public entity. All members should post a note like this. If you prefer, you can copy and place this version. If you don\u2019t post the statement at least once, you will silently allow your photos to be used and the information contained in profile status updates. Not \u201d share \u201c, but \u201d copy +paste \u201c Their new algorithm chooses the same people-around 25-who will read your posts. For this reason: Keep your finger down everywhere in this post and it will pop up copy. Click Copy, then go to your page, start a new post and put your finger anywhere in the empty field. Paste will come out and click on it. This will bypass the system. I don\u2019t allow Facebook to share anything of mine that I put on their website. Photos, current or past, posts, phone numbers or emails\u2026 absolutely nothing can be used in any form without my written permission or verbal content.\u201d The complete post can be read in its archived version here.\n\nWhen Vishvas News earlier investigated, we found that as per Facebook\u2019s \u2018Terms and Conditions\u2018 of Facebook, the user owns the intellectual property rights of the posts they share on Facebook. The complete details can be read here. It further reads that the users are free to share their content with anyone else, wherever they want.\n\nThe \u2018Help Community\u2018 page of Facebook states that the viral post is scam and users should report this post whenever they see it. This is in response to a user\u2019s query.\n\nThe complete fact check can be seen here.\n\nThe spokesperson of Facebook responded to Vishvas News over mail and quoted: \u201cFacebook takes privacy seriously and we have a range of controls built into our product that enable people to determine who sees the content they share on Facebook. We would never arbitrarily make private posts and photographs public without express consent.\u201d\n\nFacebook user Mehmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m shared the post. We scanned the profile of the user and found that the user is based out of Turkey.\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
