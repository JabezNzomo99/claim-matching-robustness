(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nLet\u2019s take these supposed family units one by one.\n\nHitler officially died childless, though a man named Jean-Marie Loret maintained until he died that he was the only son of the German dictator. Merkel, meanwhile, was born in Hamburg, West Germany, in 1954 to Horst Kasner, a Lutheran minister. Her mother, Herlind Kasner, was an English teacher.\n\nLike his son Justin Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre Trudeau, was once the Canadian prime minister. Trudeau\u2019s mother, Margaret Trudeau, was an activist and she once visited Cuba and met Castro, but that was several years after Justin Trudeau was born. There\u2019s a conspiracy theory that Justin Trudeau is the product of an alleged affair between his mother and Castro but both Snopes and the Associated Press have debunked it.\n\nIt is believed that Castro had 11 children, but the Canadian prime minister was not one of them.\n\nBarbara Bush, mother to George W. and Jeb, was born in 1925 to Pauline and Marvin Pierce. Her father was the president of McCall Corporation.\n\nThe claims about her and the other public figures in this post are ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
