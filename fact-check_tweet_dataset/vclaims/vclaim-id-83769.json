The photo is being misused out of context. The original image was published in 2016 by a major media organisation of the flip flops being distributed to residents in a Philippine city.\n\nThe posts, including this and this, claim the photo shows the flip slops were found at an abandoned camp of the New People\u2019s Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines.\n\nThe NPA has said it aims to overthrow the government of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, Robredo\u2019s rival. In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately, and can belong to rival parties.\n\nThe post, when translated to English, says:\n\n\u201cLook: Thousands of unused Robredo's slippers found in Abandoned NPA Camp. Leni is actually the one who distributes slippers to the NPA rebels. I thought Korina Sanchez Roxas was the one who always give away the yellow slippers, Leni does it too! This just proves that Leni is connected to the NPA!\n\nKorina Sanchez Roxas is the wife of Manuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas II and was Robredo\u2019s partymate in the 2016 elections. Robredo and Roxas run under the Liberal Party, which is now the main opposition under the Duterte administration.\n\nA reverse image search traced the photo back to an image taken by local news organization Inquirer.net in 2016.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the Inquirer\u2019s website showing the photo:\n\nThe caption for the photo explains the flip flops were given by Vice Mayor Joy Belmonte to residents of the Bahay Toro village in Quezon City on March 14, 2016. They were distributed during her birthday celebration.\n\nThe photo was taken by Inquirer photographer Ni\u00f1o Jesus Orbeta. He confirmed to AFP that it was his photo and that the claim made in the Facebook post was not true.\n\n\u201cThat is the downside of social media/ internet. Especially when you're a photographer and your photos are out there, they can too easily be copied and pasted and used for other people's agenda,\u201d he told AFP via Facebook messenger on November 21.\n\nIbarra Gutierrez III, Robredo\u2019s spokesman, also told AFP the posts were false.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete fabrication,\u201d Gutierrez said via Facebook messenger on November 20.\n\nTwo of the false posts, which went on Facebook on November 17 and 18, were shared more than 11,000 times in less than four days.", "lang": "en"}
