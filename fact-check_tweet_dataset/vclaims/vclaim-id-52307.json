MAGA!!!!!\"\n\nWhat you shouldn\u2019t believe is this Facebook post, which was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe\u2019ve already fact-checked a batch of photos wrongly claiming to show the crowd that gathered for President Donald Trump\u2019s June 20 campaign rally at BOK Center in Tulsa, Okla. The images in this post are also being misused to make it look like Trump\u2019s rally was packed, when the actual attendance was far lower than the campaign\u2019s stated expectations.\n\nWe used Google Images and TinEye to do reverse image searches of the photos in the Facebook post to figure out what they actually show.\n\nThe first photo is from a Trump rally at the Florida State Fairgrounds in July 2018.\n\nThe second photo is from a Trump rally in Manchester, N.H., in February 2020.\n\nThe third photo is from a rally in Lexington, Ky., in November 2019.", "lang": "en"}
