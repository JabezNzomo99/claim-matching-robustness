Trump tweeted this in response to actress Meryl Streep\u2019s Jan. 8 speech at the Golden Globe Awards, where she said it \u201ckind of broke my heart\u201d to see Trump imitate Kovaleski, who has a disability that visibly limits joint movement in his limbs.\n\nKovaleski wrote then that \u201claw enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.\u201d When asked about Trump\u2019s claims about 9/11, Kovaleski said in 2016: \u201cI certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember.\u201d\n\nWe won\u2019t challenge his judgment of acting talent or his opinion of Streep. But we will note that Streep has 19 Oscar nominations and three wins, 30 Golden Globe nominations and eight wins (and holds the record for the most Oscar and Golden Globe nominations), two Emmy Awards and a Tony Award nomination.\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles timed its announcement for the annual auto show, and said the decision to invest $1 billion was part of a long-term business strategy and the company\u2019s industrialization plan. The industrial plan was initially discussed as a part of the company\u2019s 2015 contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers, and the company first shared the plan publicly in January 2016, company spokeswoman Jody Tinson said.\n\nWe covered Trump\u2019s claim about Ford when he tweeted it last week. Analysts say the company\u2019s decision has more to do with the company\u2019s long-term goal \u2014 particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles \u2014 than with the administration.\n\nTrump is being misleading when he says he has \u201cnothing to do with Russia.\u201d It may be possible that he has no current investments, deals or loans with Russia \u2014 but not for the lack of trying. Trump repeatedly sought deals in Russia since the 1980s. But Trump has refused to release his tax returns, so the public has no way of verifying whether Trump currently has Russian assets.\n\nMoreover, Trump dismisses reports that U.S. officials briefed him on a classified report alleging that Russian intelligence services have compromising information on Trump as \u201cfake news.\u201d U.S. officials have told The Washington Post that they have briefed Trump and President Obama on the allegations, which U.S. intelligence agencies have not corroborated.\n\nThis does not comport with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper\u2019s version of the conversation. In his statement on his discussion with Trump, Clapper said he expressed \u201cprofound dismay\u201d that the secret, unsubstantiated document leaked to the media. But Clapper didn\u2019t say he denounced the report.\n\nNot to pick nits, but we\u2019ll note that Linda Bean is one of 50-plus family members involved with L.L. Bean, and the company has distanced itself from Bean\u2019s personal political views. (Note: Current White House policy prohibits the president from endorsing a company like this.) In a statement reacting to a boycott of L.L. Bean based on Linda Bean\u2019s politics, the company said:\n\n\u201cWe fully acknowledge and respect that some may disagree with the political views of a single member of our 10-person board of directors. Like most large families, the more than 50 family member-owners of the business hold views and embrace causes across the political spectrum, just as our employees and customers do. And as every member of the family would agree, no individual alone speaks on behalf of the business or represents the values of the company that L.L. built. \u2026 Simply put, we stay out of politics.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
