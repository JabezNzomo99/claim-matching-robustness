No, that's not true, despite the headline of an article being pushed by a network of foreign-run websites. The poll to which the article refers is not new and it does not show a majority siding with Trump in the way one would expect after reading just that headline. Despite Trump's improving approval rating the article is not real news but a piece of clickbait deployed by foreigners looking to make a quick buck off gullible conservatives and Trump supporters sharing and liking the story.\n\nThe story appeared in an article published on a website named \"Phoenix US News\" on October 1, 2018 titled \"New Poll Finds That The Majority Side With Trump... Are You One Of Them?\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe mainstream media want you to know that the majority of the US citizens are against Trump's executive orders, but that i\u0455 not the truth! Whoa, that's the \"first\" time the mainstream media lies. A new poll on Fox News shows that the majority of Americans do not see Trump's executive order as a \"Muslim ban\". The poll says, 56 percent of the registered voters deemed the order a \" terrorist hot spot restriction,\" while 37 percent said it is more likely \"Muslim Ban.\" Although more than half of the those polled do not believe the move was not an attempt to discriminate based on religion, a majority of the country disapproves of the executive order. Forty-six percent supported Trump's Jan. 27 immigration order, according to Washington Examiner. 1,013 registered voters nationwide voted through landline and cellphone interviews. The poll was conducted by the Anderson Robbins Research and Shaw & Company Research. The survey's margin of error was three percentage points for all registered voters.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe poll in question already dates back to February 2017 when Fox News first reported on it. The poll was about the executive order putting a 90-day travel ban on people from certain countries:\n\nThe \"majority\" mentioned in the story comes from this part:\n\nDespite \"siding\" with Trump on the description of the executive order, a majority disapproved of the measure:\n\nIn addition to that, a quick look at Trump's current job approval (which is what most people would understand in the context of \"siding with\") shows that it currently stands at about 43.9%, definitely not a majority even though the number has been steadily improving over the past year or so, up from a low of 37% in December 2017.\n\nSo, in summary: not a new poll and not a majority. Yet the same story was pushed on several other websites:\n\u2022 New Poll Finds That The Majority Side With Trump...
