Until these are clarified, the claim is unproven.\n\u2022 None Wood fuel makes up 63.2% of Kenya\u2019s energy demand, according to the most recent economic survey. This is slightly higher than Kihika\u2019s claim of 60%. \n\n\n\nKenya\u2019s 18-month-long ban on logging has closed businesses and caused a rise in both unemployment and construction costs, a senator has claimed.\n\nis urging a review of the ban,\n\nin February 2018 in response to concern that the uncontrolled destruction of forests could lead to drought.\n\nTo show that the ban was doing more harm than good, Kihika gave statistics on forestry\u2019s importance to the economy.\n\n\u201cWe cannot ignore the fact that the forestry sector contributes 3.6% of the national gross domestic product and 60% of the national energy requirements are met from wood fuel,\u201d Kihika\n\nIt is a contested issue. Some senators\n\n, urging that the ban be extended for years.\n\nBut do her statistics check out?\n\nKihika told Africa Check her numbers were from two sources: a 2018 government\n\n, prepared by the environment ministry, did find that Kenya\u2019s forestry sector accounted for 3.6% of gross domestic product.\n\nIt gave the 2014 FAO report as its source, but\n\nthe UN agency\u2019s estimate \u201cexcludes forestry\u2019s contribution to household wood energy, non-timber products and the vast value of ecosystem services\u201d.\n\nBut the FAO report estimated that the formal forestry sector made up\n\nin 2011, from wages, profits and timber. When the informal sector such as woodfuel and charcoal was counted, forestry\u2019s contribution\n\n\u2013 still lower than the taskforce\u2019s estimate of 3.6%.\n\nThe government\u2019s estimate of a 3.6% share is also found in official reports from the\n\nAfrica Check asked the forest service how they arrived at the 3.6% figure. Leakey Sonkoyo, the agency\u2019s spokesperson, told us it was from a joint\n\nand the water and irrigation ministry.\n\nthe official figure, which put forestry\u2019s GDP contribution at 1.1%, was a \u201cgross underestimate\u201d. This was by \u201cat least 2.5%, which puts the estimate of its annual contribution to GDP to around 3.6%\u201d.\n\nSamuel Muriithi, the agency\u2019s head of forest economics, told Africa Check the official estimate had left out important contributions, such as the value manufacturing added to forest products.\n\nBut the difference remains in other official statistics. The national data agency\u2019s\n\nestimated that forestry and logging contributed 1.3% to GDP in 2018. It has maintained a steady average of 1.3% from 2014 to 2018, even as its\n\nfrom KSh42.9 billion in 2014 to KSh49.9 billion in 2018.\n\nWe have asked the two state agencies to explain the difference. Until we get this clarification we will rate the senator\u2019s claim as unproven.\n\nKihika told Africa Check the 60% figure came from a 2015 Kenya Forest Service report. We have, however, been unable to trace this report.\n\n70% of Kenya\u2019s energy supply. The FAO\u2019s 2014 State of the World\u2019s Forests\n\nits energy from electricity, petroleum and oil products, and from biomass, which includes charcoal, wood fuel, ethanol, biodiesel and agricultural waste. Energy is measured in joules. A terajoule is a trillion joules.\n\nThe most recent economic survey shows demand in 2018.\n\nWood fuel\u2019s share of 63% is in fact slightly higher than the senator\u2019s figure of 60%. We therefore rate this claim as correct.", "lang": "en"}
