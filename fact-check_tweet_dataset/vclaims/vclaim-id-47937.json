Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim. \n\n\n\nClaim: Image of the bridge constructed by Japan in 24 hours. Fact: The bridge is a part of National Highway-305, and is present in the stretch of Akasaka-cho and Ikura-cho in Fukui City of Fukui Province, Japan. This entire project took about 4 months for completion and the construction of the bridge itself took almost 2 months. So, the claim that the bridge is constructed in 24 hours is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo in the post was subjected to reverse image search technique, a search result will lead to an article of \u2018DKN.TV\u2019 that had the same image. From the article, it was known that in July 2018, the landslides caused due to heavy rains in Fukui City have blocked some stretch of a Highway-305 for 4 months and was later opened for traffic after the construction of the bridge.\n\n\n\nFrom article of \u2018Fukui Shimbun\u2019 published on 1st November 2018, it was known that after the landslide blocked the Highway-305, about 10 kms of the surrounding area of this point was closed, and of this, about 5.1 km between Tamagawa and Akasaka Town, the rocks and stones along the way were cleared there. And then a temporary road was constructed at Ikura Town in 2 months by raising iron posts to the seaside and bypassing approximately the 80-meter section of the highway that was blocked by the rock and sand deposits due to the landslide. The article even has the October 31st photo that shows traffic flow resuming after 4 months due to the opening of the bridge. So, from the above information, it is clear that for the completion of the entire project i.e., from the start of the project to its construction, it took almost 4 months and the construction of the bridge itself took almost 2 months.\n\n\n\nThe \u2018Fukui Shimbun\u2019 article published on 9th August 2018, has information about how Fukui Province officials are considering a plan for constructing a bridge on Highway-305 that was blocked due to landslide sediments.\n\n\n\nAnd a tweet on 30th October 2018, by another Japanese news agency \u2018Yomiuri Shimbun\u2019 has the information that the National Highway-305 blocked due to the landslides in July is set to open for traffic on October 31st through the newly constructed \u2018U\u2019 shaped bridge. The tweet even had aerial view photos of that newly constructed bridge. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, the bridge in Japan wasn\u2019t constructed in 24 hours. That entire project took about 4 months for completion and the construction of the bridge itself took almost 2 months.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
