The claim is false; the image has been used in a misleading context; it is an old photo of Anies visiting a neighborhood which was affected by flooding in February 2017, before he was elected governor.\n\nThis January 1, 2020, blog post published the photo of Anies who looked soaking wet.\n\nTranslated to English, the Indonesian-language\u2019s headline reads: \u201cLook, This Is Anies\u2019s Condition When He Is Handling Jakarta Flood.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the blog post:\n\nThe first three paragraphs of the blog post read: \u201cToday\u2019s floods really drained the energy of Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan. Since receiving the report about the flooding, Anies directly stepped in to help flood victims on Wednesday, January 1, 2020.\n\n\u201cDespite being attacked on social media, the former education minister was still patient observing each flooding spot. He also patiently gave instructions to his subordinates to stay ready to help the victims.\n\n\u201cWith wet clothes due to the rains, Anies also told all Jakarta government personnel to step in to help the 2020 Jakarta flood victims. Anies reminded that all evacuation shelters and evacuees\u2019 needs to be well equipped.\u201d\n\nThe same photo also appeared with similar claims on Facebook here, here and here, where it has been shared more than 1,100 times.\n\nThe photo was also published in this and this blog post alongside similar claims.\n\n\u201cAnies\u201d refers to Anies Baswedan, who has been the governor of Jakarta since October 2017.\n\nWidespread flooding hit Jakarta and its surrounding suburbs in the first days of January 2020, killing at least 60 people and leaving tens of thousands in the capital city unable to return to their waterlogged homes, as reported by AFP on January 5, 2020, here.\n\nBut the claim is false; the image has been used in a misleading context; it is an old photo of Anies visiting a neighborhood which was affected by flooding in February 2017, before he was elected governor.\n\nA Google reverse image followed by a subsequent keyword search found this original photo posted on Gerindra Party\u2019s official Facebook page on February 20, 2017.\n\nHere is a screenshot comparison between the picture in the misleading post (L) and Gerindra Party\u2019s picture (R):\n\nThe photo is part of this Facebook post, which includes five other pictures of Anies.\n\nTranslated from Indonesian to English, the caption of the post reads: \u201cThis morning Anies Baswedan visited the flood-hit Cipinang Melayu, Makasar, East Jakarta and interacted with local residents. During the visit, the residents told him their hope that if Anies and Sandi are elected governor and deputy governor of Jakarta, they can immediately solve the flood problem in the capital city without resorting to evictions.\u201d\n\nIndonesian media Kumparan published this report about Anies\u2019s visit on February 20, 2017. Translated from Indonesian-language to English, the report\u2019s headline reads: \u201cAnies Baswedan Inspects Flood in Cipinang Melayu.\u201d\n\nTranslated, the first two paragraphs of the report reads: \u201cJakarta governor candidate Anies Baswedan inspected flood affected area in Cipinang Melayu, Kampung Makasar, East Jakarta, Monday (20/2). Arriving at the location at around 10:30 am local time, Anies visited some residential areas which are still inundated with water.\n\n\u201cWearing a red jacket, Anies who had just arrived, went straight to the flooded residential areas. He also walked in an area which was inundated with thigh-deep water.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Kumparan report:\n\nBacked by Gerindra Party, Anies and his running mate Sandiaga Uno won the final round of the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election, as reported by The Jakarta Post on April 19, 2017, here. The pair were inaugurated on October 16, 2017.", "lang": "en"}
