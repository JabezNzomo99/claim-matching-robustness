Chris Coons (D-Del.) cited an online poll on carbon taxes that has some suspect methodology.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T19:52:35Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85889", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/13/here-are-some-red-flags-to-fishy-polling-on-carbon-taxes/", "vclaim": "The Fact Checker has often warned readers against relying on opt-in Internet surveys that do not accurately estimate population values \u2014 and this was another example of that. We want to use this exchange over the Keystone XL pipeline as an opportunity to help readers \u2014 and politicians tempted to cite them \u2014 develop a more discerning eye when quoting polls. In particular, the first step is: always check the methodology.\n\nAfter speaking with the researchers, The Fact Checker learned it was an opt-in online survey of voters. Researchers compiled a representative sample of respondents based on Census data, then screened them based on the target population of the poll, using quotas on age, race, region and gender. Then, respondents were further screened based on their vote history in the last two major elections (2014 and 2012), and whether the respondent was likely to vote in 2016.\n\nNonetheless, Coons correctly cited the study. In response to a series of questions about the issues Congress should act on to reduce the threat of global climate change, 75 percent of respondents agreed Congress should \u201chave the Environmental Protection Agency regulate emissions of carbon dioxide as a pollutant.\u201d In addition, 75 percent of respondents agreed that Congress should \u201cenact a carbon tax on pollutants and use the revenues to pay for new, cleaner technologies for the future.\u201d\n\nPublic support for carbon tax is sensitive to the potential size of the tax. The June 2014 Post-ABC poll found 70 percent believed the federal government should limit the release of greenhouse gases from existing power plants in an effort to reduce global warming. The same percentage believed the government should require states to limit the amount of greenhouses gases produced within their borders. When asked both questions under the scenario that it would raise their monthly energy expenses by $20 a month, the percentage decreased. At least six in 10 supported each, under the scenario of a $20 monthly bill.\n\nThe public\u2019s enthusiasm for the carbon tax also was sensitive to what the tax revenues would potentially fund. For example, a July 2014 survey by the University of Michigan\u2019s Center for Local, State and Urban Policy found that most Americans oppose a carbon tax when there is no specified use for the tax revenue. A revenue-neutral carbon tax, in which the revenues are returned to the public as a rebate check, received 56 percent support. Sixty percent supported a tax with revenues used to fund research and development for renewable energy programs.\n\nWhile the report that Coons cited generally reflects public sentiments on carbon tax and emissions regulations, public support for the carbon tax carries some caveats. The figure on carbon tax that Coons cited lacks context, and how sensitive public support for the carbon tax can be. We award Two Pinocchios to Coons \u2014 and to media outlets that have cited the poll \u2014 for relying on a survey with a narrow respondent panel to portray American public opinion. As we have noted before, it is up to the politician to properly vet the quality of polls before citing them.", "lang": "en"}
