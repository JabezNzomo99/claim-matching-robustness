McDaniel arrived in a rhinestone-studded turquoise gown with white gardenias in her hair \u2026 McDaniel then was escorted, not to the Gone With the Wind table \u2014 where Selznick sat with de Havilland and his two Oscar-nominated leads, Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable \u2014 but to a small table set against a far wall, where she took a seat with her escort, F.P. Yober, and her white agent, William Meiklejohn. With the hotel\u2019s strict no-blacks policy, Selznick had to call in a special favor just to have McDaniel allowed into the building (it was officially integrated by 1959, when the Unruh Civil Rights Act outlawed racial discrimination in California).\n\nThe 2008 book \u201cAfrican Americans and the Oscar: Decades of Struggle and Achievement\u201d noted that McDaniel was the first Black actor to attend an Academy Awards banquet, but also noted that the award-winning actress was relegated to a table in the back of the room:\n\nA video from the Oscars\u2019 YouTube channel gives a longer (although not complete) look at her speech. As Fay Bainter presents the award, the camera cuts to show prominent white actors in the crowd, but McDaniel is nowhere to be seen:\n\n\n\n The above-displayed video from the Oscars YouTube channel also omits McDaniel\u2019s approach to the stage. We\u2019ve reached out to the Academy to see if the full video (or any photographs of McDaniel\u2019s table are archived) and will update this article if more information becomes available.\n\nIt should also be noted that McDaniel was not invited to the premiere of \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d in 1939. The premiere was held in Atlanta, Georgia, which at the time had strict segregation laws. Selznick attempted to get some of the Black actors who worked on the film, including McDaniel, invited to the premiere, but MGM studios advised against it because she would not have been allowed to sit in the theater with her white co-stars.\n\nHere\u2019s a video from the Smithsonian about McDaniel and the bigotry she faced after filming \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
