Do you feel any empathy with them? WAYNE: I don\u2019t feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves. PLAYBOY: Weren\u2019t the Indians \u2014 by virtue of prior possession \u2014 the rightful owners of the land? WAYNE: Look, I\u2019m sure there have been inequalities. If those inequalities are presently affecting any of the Indians now alive, they have a right to a court hearing. But what happened 100 years ago in our country can\u2019t be blamed on us today. PLAYBOY: Indians today are still being dehumanized on reservations. WAYNE: I\u2019m quite sure that the concept of a government-run reservation would have an ill effect on anyone. But that seems to be what the socialists are working for have everyone cared for from cradle to grave. PLAYBOY: Indians on reservations are more neglected than cared for. Even if you accept the principle of expropriation, don\u2019t you think a more humane solution to the Indian problem could have been devised? WAYNE: This may come as a surprise to you, but I wasn\u2019t alive when reservations were if I do look that old. I have no idea what the best method of dealing with the Indians in the 1800s would have been. Our forefathers evidently thought they were\n\n doing the right thing. PLAYBOY: How do you feel about the government grant for a university and cultural center that these Indians [occupying Alcatraz] have demanded as \u201creparations\u201d? WAYNE: What happened between their forefathers and our forefathers is so far wrong or I don\u2019t see why we owe them anything. I don\u2019t know why the government should give them something that it wouldn\u2019t give me.", "lang": "en"}
