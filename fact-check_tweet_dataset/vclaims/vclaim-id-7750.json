In September 2015, the pro-Kremlin REN TV channel produced a poorly photo-shopped image showing then U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Tefft attending an opposition rally in Moscow. The Embassy responded humorously with photo-shopped images of Tefft appearing on the moon, in a historic WWII-era photograph, and in various other exotic locales.\n\nMichael McFaul, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, also faced attacks in the Russian press for meeting with opposition figures during a period that saw large anti-government demonstrations in Moscow and other Russian cities.\n\n\"Just as President Obama did when he visited Moscow in July 2009, all senior U.S. officials visiting Russia make a point of meeting with both government officials and civil society leaders,\" McFaul wrote in a LiveJournal post after meeting with opposition politicians just a few days into his tenure as U.S. ambassador in January 2012.\n\nSeveral days later, then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said in a speech at Moscow State University that McFaul\u2019s meeting with opposition leaders was nothing out of the ordinary, but urged the ambassador to respect Russia\u2019s political sensibilities.", "lang": "en"}
