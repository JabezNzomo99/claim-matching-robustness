But neither Moscow nor Zakharchenko\u2019s fellow separatists seem very keen, to say nothing of other Ukrainians.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "July 26, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-20998", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-ukraine-malorossiya-/28637002.html", "vclaim": "On July 18, 2017, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, leader of the separatists who control the city of Donetsk and part of the surrounding province, announced that a referendum would soon be held on the creation of a new state called Malorossiya (Little Russia). Zakharchenko not only said that the state would be a union with his fellow separatists in the Luhansk region, but also invited all other regions of Ukraine, with the exception of Russia-occupied Crimea, to join the new entity, which would have its capital in Donetsk.\n\nIn Moscow, MP Leonid Kalashnikov, chairman of the Duma Committee on CIS (former Soviet states) Affairs, reacted positively to Zakharchenko\u2019s announcement, telling the state-owned RIA Novosti news agency:\n\n\u201cThe creation of such a state is possible and, likely even inevitable, judging by what is going on in Ukraine. The government, instead of resolving the issue, ever tightens and tightens the knot of military actions, but the people cannot live at war forever - something must be done. So the creation of a such an independent state could be a way out for these people.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that neither Kalashnikov\u2019s peers in the Russian government, nor Zakharchenko\u2019s fellow separatists in the Donbas, let alone the people of the rest of Ukraine, have shown much enthusiasm for the idea of Malorossiya.\n\nJust hours after Zakharchenko made his announcement at a press conference in Donetsk, Vladimir Degtyarenko, a separatist leader in Luhansk, said that the Luhansk separatists had never been informed of the Donetsk separatist leader\u2019s plans.\n\nDegtyarenko said that the Luhansk separatists remained committed to the Minsk peace plan, something which the Malorossiya proposal would directly contradict, and added that \u201cat this moment, the viability of such a step raises major doubts.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee at Russia's Federation Council, suggested Zakharchenko\u2019s announcement was born of emotion, and noted, like Degtyarenko, that the \u201cunilateral initiative\u201d was \u201cincompatible with the logic of the Minsk agreements.\u201d\n\nDmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary, also put distance between the Russian government and the Malorossiya announcement by stressing that the proposal was Zakharchenko\u2019s \u201cpersonal initiative\u201d and claiming that \u201cMoscow first found out about this from the media.\u201d\n\nThe BBC notes that, while Zakharchenko\u2019s announcement had received extensive coverage on Russian state media for a few hours, it was \u201ccompletely ignored in Russia\u2019s main evening TV news bulletins - after Mr Peskov\u2019s comments.\u201d\n\nEven within Zakharchenko\u2019s own self-declared government, there was a striking lack of enthusiasm, with Luhansk separatist leader Denis Pushilin commenting that it \u201ccould be an interesting initiative,\u201d but was \u201cjust an idea at the moment.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
