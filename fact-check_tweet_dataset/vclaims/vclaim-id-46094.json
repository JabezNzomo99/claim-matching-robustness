Duterte is the kind of leader who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way. Filipinos are very fortunate to have him. Seriously, he looked so overworked. He may not be perfect but he truly loves his country. Philippines doesn\u2019t have the worst government. It actually has the worst citizens.\u201d\n\nThis is fake. The Queen's address was primarily one of gratitude and appreciation for the efforts of Britain's frontliners and other essential workers in the country's fight against the pandemic. She also said Britain joins all nations in a common endeavor to meet the health challenge, but made no mention of any country or leader.\n\nMore, the circulating post is a tampered version of an April 6 infographic by Inquirer.net uploaded on its FB and Twitter accounts.\n\nIt originally read: \u201cThis time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us.\u201d\n\nThe fabricated quote of Queen Elizabeth surfaced following the proliferation of other fake quote cards featuring fictional or well-known personalities supposedly expressing their support for Duterte, amid criticism of his administration\u2019s response to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThis is not the first time a fake statement praising Duterte was attributed to the Queen. In December 2019, VERA Files Fact Check debunked a post that shows Queen Elizabeth telling United States President Donald Trump to \u201cemulate\u201d Duterte. (See: VERA FILES FACT CHECK: FAKE post claiming Queen Elizabeth told Trump to emulate Duterte leadership revived)\n\nThe recent fake quote card has been shared by a number of netizens. Among its earliest iterations is a post that has now gained over 3,000 shares and more than 800 reactions on FB.", "lang": "en"}
