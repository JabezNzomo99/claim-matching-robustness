However, the light source is not a fire built inside this snowy structure. It\u2019s actually a flashlight.\n\nThis picture was snapped by Ukrainian photographer Volodymyr Shevchuk in the Carpathian Mountains circa 2015. While we couldn\u2019t find this exact image on Shevchuk\u2019s social media profiles, he has posted several other photographs of this illuminated igloo to both his Instagram and Facebook pages:\n\nWe reached out to Shevchuk for more information about the photographs, and he told us it was a flashlight, not a fire, illuminating this igloo from within. Furthermore, this is a \u201clong exposure\u201d photograph, which means that the camera\u2019s shutter was held open for an extended period of time, allowing more light to hit the sensor. In other words, this igloo wouldn\u2019t appear nearly as bright to a person standing next to it.\n\nShevchuk told us: \u201cWe built this igloo in the Ukrainian Carpathians. The light in the middle is a flashlight. Photo taken at long exposure.\u201d\n\nWhile the images above may give viewers the impression that raging bonfires were commonly built inside of igloos, that wasn\u2019t the case. Traditionally, a much smaller flame from a kudlik (qulliq), a sort of lamp or candle made from seal-oil or blubber, was used to light and heat the inside of an igloo.\n\nA qulliq can be seen in the following video (starting around the 1:30 mark) from an episode of the BBC\u2019s \u201cRay Mears World of Survival\u201d:\n\nIgloos are made from blocks of compact snow, rather than blocks of ice, and snow is a rather good insulator. This makes it possible to keep the interior of an igloo at a reasonable temperature (above freezing) using only body heat, even when the temperatures outside plummet:\n\nSnow is such a good insulator that some animals dig snow caves in which to hibernate through the winter. New snow is composed of a high percentage of air trapped among the accumulated snow crystals. Since the air can barely move, heat transfer is greatly reduced. Fresh, uncompacted snow typically is 90 to 95 percent trapped air. Many animals take advantage of snow\u2019s insulating qualities, and burrow into the snow to hibernate through the winter.\n\nThe following video from the PBS Digital Studios\u2019 YouTube channel It\u2019s OK To Be Smart provides some more information on how igloos are built and how they are kept warm:\n\nWhile a quilliq was traditionally used to heat and light an igloo\u2019s insides, we did find a number of videos featuring wood bonfires.
