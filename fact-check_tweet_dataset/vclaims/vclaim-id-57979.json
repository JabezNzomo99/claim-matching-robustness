The bulletin has been generated using an online tool. A meme generator called 'Break Your Own News' has been used to create the 'Breaking News' template in the graphic. The website allows the user to insert any image and add a news headline. The logo of ABP News has been added to the template available on the website.\n\nThe Logical Indian had earlier also debunked similar fake bulletins which can be read here and here.\n\n Distressing videos and images of Rhea Chakraborty being mobbed by the media as she tried making her way into the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) office, escorted by police personnel were found all over social media. The media's behaviour was barbaric and threw light on the unfortunate state of journalism in the country. It is a sad truth that the tragic death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput has attracted media attention in all the wrong ways.
