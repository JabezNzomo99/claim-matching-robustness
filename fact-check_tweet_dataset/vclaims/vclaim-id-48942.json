Pompeo\u2019s comments with interviewer Martha Raddatz on This Week occurred as follows:\n\nRADDATZ: Do you believe it was manmade or genetically modified? POMPEO: Look, the best experts so far seem to think it was manmade. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point. RADDATZ: Your -- your Office of the [director of national intelligence] DNI says the consensus, the scientific consensus was not manmade or genetically modified. POMPEO: That's right. I -- I -- I agree with that. Yes. I've -- I've seen their analysis. I've seen the summary that you saw that was released publicly. I have no reason to doubt that that is accurate at this point. RADDATZ: OK, so just to be clear, you do not think it was manmade or genetically modified? POMPEO: I've seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they've got it wrong.\n\nThe presentation of this exchange on 60 Minutes can be viewed here:\n\nWhile 60 Minutes does not include the entirety of the ABC interview in its segment, it provides enough of it to make clear to viewers that Pompeo walked back his initial claim that the virus was manmade. In fact, immediately after showing clips of Pompeo affirming the unproven claim that the virus was manmade, CBS showed Pompeo insisting that he agrees with the findings of the intelligence community that it was not manmade. And 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley emphasizes that Pompeo made both sides of the same argument, noting the secretary \u201ctried to have it both ways\u201d on the claim. 60 Minutes did not \u201ccut out the portion of Pompeo's remarks where he clearly acknowledges that he agrees with the intelligence community assessment,\u201d as Press Secretary McEnany said, but showed the relevant parts of the exchange, accurately capturing Pompeo\u2019s conflicting claims regarding the intelligence on the origins of the virus.\n\n60 Minutes\u2019 tweet, on the other hand, does not include the entirety of the show\u2019s reporting. The tweeted video cuts off immediately after Pelley says this: \u201cLast Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attempted to resurrect a debunked theory that the virus was manmade in China.\u201d The tweeted video omits Pompeo\u2019s next answer, in which he agrees with the intelligence community consensus that the virus was not manmade.\n\nThe criticism of the full 60 Minutes report, as it aired on show Sunday evening, is off-base. When State Department spokeswoman Ortagus accuses CBS of airing \u201ca report Sunday evening that failed to accurately portray the clear intent of Secretary Pompeo's remarks to Martha Raddatz on ABC News regarding the origin of the virus in Wuhan, China,\u201d she\u2019s wrong. (And, as the transcript makes clear, Pompeo\u2019s intent was anything but clear.) But the criticism of the 60 Minutes tweet promoting the segment is warranted. That clip included only Pelley\u2019s claim that Pompeo \u201cattempted to resurrect a debunked theory\u201d and elided the secretary\u2019s acknowledgement, moments later, that the intelligence community has concluded the virus is not manmade.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
