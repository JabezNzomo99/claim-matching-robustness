The image appears to have been created as satire.\n\nThe original cartoon ad has been taken from January 24, 2019, when Amul released a cartoon on Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's formal entry into politics.

Rahul Da Cunha, creative director at the agency confirmed the viral photo was fake and that it did not come from the agency.\n\nThe story has been updated with a response from the agency responsible for creating Amul's Ad campaign.", "lang": "en"}
