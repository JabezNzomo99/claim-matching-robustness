So his $1 trillion infrastructure proposal \u2014 spent over five years \u2014 is just a relatively small piece of that.\n\nWe are not going to dispute CTJ\u2019s estimates, but it\u2019s worth noting that nine of these companies did pay federal taxes in at least one year. Sanders\u2019s justifies his \u201cnot one nickel\u201d comment by adding up the tax bill over five years. So General Electric, for instance, paid federal taxes in 2011, 2012 and 2013\u2014but Sanders claims negative taxes because the tax losses in 2010 and 2009 (in the aftermath of the financial crisis) exceeded the taxes paid in later years.\n\nImagine if you got tax refunds in 2009 and 2010 that exceeded the taxes you paid in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Would you say you paid \u201cnot one nickel\u201d in federal taxes? Didn\u2019t think so. (Note: this example is not directly comparable because the tax losses allow companies to get refunds of taxes they owed and paid in the past.)\n\nMoreover, Sanders is highlighting an important issue that has spawned bipartisan concern \u2014 the growing practice of U.S. multinational corporations avoiding or reducing U.S. taxes by keeping profits overseas in low-tax havens. One recent study, by Reed College economics professor Kimberly Clausing, estimates that the growing practice has led to revenue losses of between $77 billion and $111 billion by 2012. So we are not talking about an insubstantial amount of money.\n\nWould tapping these overseas profits be enough to fund a $1 trillion infrastructure plan? The Sanders campaign cited a Joint Committee on Taxation estimate for Sanders\u2019s Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act, which would raise more than $113 billion over the next decade, as well as an $900 billion estimate in the tax lawyer\u2019s letter for the cost of the \u201ctax expenditure\u201d that allows U.S. corporations to defer paying U.S. tax on their foreign earnings until that income is repatriated.\n\nAs we have written before, policymakers cannot assume that estimates for tax expenditures will result in the same level of revenue if such tax loopholes are eliminated. So a $900 billion tax expenditure does not automatically translate into $900 billion in revenue. But Kleinbard thinks that the number is not out of line, given that between $200 billion and $600 billion could be raised imposing a one-time mandatory clean-up tax on all low-taxed foreign earnings existing at the time of the conversion to a new tax system.\n\nA lot depends on how the law is crafted but \u201cyou might well conclude that it would be perfectly plausible to imagine picking up $500 to $600 billion in actual revenue in the first 5 years alone, so easily over $1 trillion over 10 \u2014 not counting the backward looking tax on existing earnings,\u201d Kleinbard said. But he warned that no one knows how other countries (especially in the European Union) might react, which could allow them to get more of the untapped revenue. \u201cA lot more revenue might be collected in general, but now the question shifts to, how much goes to Freedonia, and how much to the U.S.?\u201d\n\nFinally, he says this spending will create as many as 13 million jobs. This is derived from a White House Council of Economic Advisers estimate that every $1 billion in federal highway and transit investment would support 13,000 jobs for one year. We have examined this estimate before, and it\u2019s worth remembering that one-third of these jobs are directly created (such as construction workers), one-third are indirectly created (such as people hired by suppliers to construction firms) and one-third are induced (jobs created as the spending by employed construction workers filters through the economy).\n\nSome readers might object to counting indirect and induced jobs as part of the calculation, but this \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d is fairly standard in terms of assessing economic impact. And, actually, 13,000 jobs per $1 billion is on the low side for these kind of estimates. Other estimates on the economic impact of government spending suggest 25,000 jobs per $1 billion, 29,000 jobs per $1 billion, 36,000 jobs per $1 billion and even 44,000 jobs per $1 billion \u2014 which certainly shows how uncertain the craft of economics can be.\n\nWe of course take no position on whether this is good public policy. But within the confines of campaign rhetoric, Sanders can make a credible case that he can fund his $1 trillion infrastructure program over a 10 year period by taxing the profits of U.S. corporations now held in low-tax tax havens \u2014 and that such a spending plan could result in 13 million jobs.\n\nFor the reasons explained, he exaggerates a bit when he says many of these corporations have paid \u201cnot a nickel\u201d in federal taxes because of offshore tax havens. Most have paid at least some taxes in some years, though the tax losses in other years may have helped make up some of the difference. Initially, we were inclined to say this was worth of One Pinocchio, but given how Sanders rephrased his talking point after we began asking questions about it \u2014 \u201cvirtually zero in federal income tax\u201d \u2014 we will leave this with no rating.", "lang": "en"}
