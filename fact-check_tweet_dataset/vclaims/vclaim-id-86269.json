What caught our eye is that he said he had a \u201cpro-life position\u201d his entire political career. Is that really the case?\n\nThere is little doubt that McCarthy has opposed abortion rights since he arrived in Congress. The question is whether it extends to his period before he arrived in Congress. News reports (some of which are not on line) pegged him as a moderate on the issue, even a supporter of abortion rights. He certainly was viewed with suspicion by some Republicans.\n\n\u201cFor nearly two decades, Thomas was often engaged in guerrilla warfare against the conservatives who controlled the state party leadership,\u201d reported the California Journal in November, 2003. \u201cAt state GOP conventions, fliers slipped under delegates\u2019 hotel room doors with harsh condemnation of Thomas have long been regular features. McCarthy was a Thomas lieutenant in those battles.\u201d Conservatives in 1993 even formed a splinter group of the young Republicans because they chafed at McCarthy\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cThe Thomas-McCarthy wars with the state party-leadership apparently peaked in 2001,\u201d the article said. \u201cThat's when they backed the unsuccessful drive by Bob Larkin and other moderates to install moderate former Assemblyman Brooks Firestone as head of the state GOP organization. They argued that GOP defeats at the ballot box in recent years were partly due to defections of women and moderates turned off by the party's hard-line stance against abortion and gun control.\u201d\n\nIn another sign of how McCarthy was viewed by some within the party, the Bakersfield California newspaper on June 1, 2003 published a scathing letter to the editor: \u201cMcCarthy has spent the better part of two decades attacking conservatives, working hard to remove the pro-life position from the Republican Party\u2019s platform and otherwise undermining God-fearing people in politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cConservatives were furious when McCarthy began positioning himself to run on a conservative platform in his race for his Assembly post last year against conservative Bakersfield Councilman Mike Maggard. McCarthy described himself as being anti-abortion in his answers on questionnaires from local and state Right to Life groups. He said he was against abortion except in cases of incest or rape or to save the life of the mother. He also said he would vote to retain the strong anti-abortion language in the state party platform.\u201d\n\nThe article noted that the \u201clatter answer was especially galling to conservatives\u201d because of his backing of Firestone, who had campaigned on a platform that called for easing the party\u2019s hard-line stance against abortion and gun control. Instead, his answers on the questionnaire mirrored those of a long-time conservative \u2013 who he then defeated.\n\nIn the article, McCarthy insisted he had always been anti-abortion but he was tolerant of other viewpoints. \"I do not base my endorsements of people on abortion as a litmus test of whether you're a Republican or not,\" he said. \"Apparently, they do.\"\n\nSkelton, the dean of California political journalists, said his notes are buried in his garage but he remembers the interview. \u201cI wrote what I did based on what I was hearing from him when questioning him on the subject, and his body language. There wasn\u2019t any grabber quote or I would have used it,\u201d he told The Fact Checker. \u201cI recall him talking like a guy who, A, was not really concerned about the issue and, B, deep down believed abortion was a woman\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. McCarthy is proud of his record protecting life. His position has been stated in every candidate questionnaire since he ran for elected office in the early 2000\u2019s and he has maintained a 100 percent rating with Right to Life since serving in Congress,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cIn the California Assembly, he had a 91 percent score with Life Priority Network and his voting record in the Assembly represents his position in support of life. Additionally, Mr. McCarthy recalls speaking with Mr. Skelton after the piece.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy framed this as a position he\u2019s taken his \u201cwhole political career.\u201d It\u2019s a judgement call as to whether a political career should extend beyond his position as an elected official, casting votes, or when he was involved in battles with social conservatives as head of the young Republicans and an aide to Thomas.\n\nThose disputes were in some ways tactical questions about how to position the party in a liberal state. McCarthy early on did not appear to be a pro-life warrior and may not have objected when he was depicted as a moderate. But since his emergence as a Republican leader, his record is fairly consistent. So we will leave this unrated.", "lang": "en"}
