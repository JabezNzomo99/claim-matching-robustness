The claim is false; the photo was taken at a 2016 demonstration in the French city of Nantes.\n\nThe photo has been shared dozens of times in this tweet by an Australian entertainment site on June 13, 2019, with the caption:\n\nClashes broke out in Hong Kong on June 12, 2019, between police and tens of thousands of protesters who opposed the government\u2019s plans to allow extradition to China. Police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds, AFP reported here on June 12.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe same photo and claim were also shared here on Facebook also on June 13, 2019, and elsewhere on Twitter, for example here with the caption: \u201cBrave HK. Putting their forehand skills to good use. #HongKong #extraditionbill #NoChinaExtradition #tennis\u201d.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo was taken during an anti-labour reform demonstration in the western French city of Nantes in June 2016.\n\nA Reuters watermark can be seen at the bottom right of the photo in the misleading post.
