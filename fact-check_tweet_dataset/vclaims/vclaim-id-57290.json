The search led us to several reports dated July 2019 suggesting Dhoni \u2018likely\u2019 to be BJP\u2019s mascot in Jharkhand assembly polls.\n\nAnother such report can be seen here.\n\nHowever, there was no official word either from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or MS Dhoni himself.\n\nMoreover, there has been no comment by MS Dhoni about him not being in the team as he did not campaign for BJP.\n\nHence, the above claims are baseless and false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
