In fact, I\u2019ll have to check but I\u2019m not even sure those windows can be opened.\u201d\n\nWhat else was happening that summer? What was the weather like that summer? Believe it or not, we called the Weather Bureau and found out what historically was the hottest day of the summer. Well, it was June 6 or June 9 or whatever it was, so we scheduled the hearing that day, and bingo: It was the hottest day on record in Washington, or close to it. It was stiflingly hot that summer. [At] the same time you had this drought all across the country, so the linkage between the Hansen hearing and the drought became very intense. And did you also alter the temperature in the hearing room that day? \u2026 What we did it was went in the night before and opened all the windows, I will admit, right? So that the air conditioning wasn\u2019t working inside the room and so when the, when the hearing occurred there was not only bliss, which is television cameras in double figures, but it was really hot. \u2026 So Hansen\u2019s giving this testimony, you\u2019ve got these television cameras back there heating up the room, and the air conditioning in the room didn\u2019t appear to work. So it was sort of a perfect collection of events that happened that day, with the wonderful Jim Hansen, who was wiping his brow at the witness table and giving this remarkable testimony.\n\nBut Hansen says it did not happen that way. \u201cYes, the \u2018window open\u2019 bit is fiction,\u201d he wrote an e-mail. \u201cAs for June 23 being chosen because it is the hottest day in climatology, I assume that is nonsense \u2014 I have not checked Washington\u2019s climatology but the hottest day normally is some weeks after the beginning of summer, not two days. I love Tim and his wife Wren, but he just made these up later to make it seem interesting.\u201d\n\nI am proud to have worked throughout 1988 to gain public and policymaker attention to the challenge of climate change. I believed then, as I do now, that this is the greatest, economic, environmental, and social issue facing humanity. I was determined to introduce a comprehensive policy proposal to combat climate change in the summer of 1988, when I knew public attention would be heightened. Prior to introduction of the climate legislation in July, and after my staff learned of the important testimony Dr. James Hansen was prepared to offer, I thought the timing for a hearing was propitious and I worked with colleagues on the Energy Committee to organize the June 23 hearing where Dr. Hansen gave his historic testimony. In view of the major drought in the United States and around the world, growing scientific concern about global warming and the content of Dr. Hansen\u2019s testimony, interest in the hearing was substantial. It was a 100 degree summer day in Washington and the room was packed with people and cameras \u2013 so it was warm and humid in the hearing room. Over the years, the testimony presented at that hearing has been identified as a key turning point in public understanding of the climate issue. Some myths about the hearing also have circulated over the years, including the idea that windows were left open or the air conditioning was not working. While I\u2019ve heard that version of events in the past, and repeated it myself, I\u2019ve since learned it didn\u2019t happen. So let\u2019s put those stories to rest and instead focus on the substance of the hearing \u2014 the brave and prescient testimony of Dr. Jim Hansen. Twenty-five years later we know he was absolutely correct, and that policymakers in the United States and around the world need to initiate far-reaching actions to address this enormous challenge.", "lang": "en"}
