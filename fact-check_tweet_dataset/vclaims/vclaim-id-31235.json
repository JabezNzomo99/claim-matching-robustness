Article 50 is the section of the Treaty on European Union that sets out the legal mechanism for a member state leaving the EU.\n\nThis is wrong. The Lord Kerr who sits on the Supreme Court is a different Lord Kerr to the Lord Kerr who was an author of Article 50.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s Lord Kerr is Brian Kerr, Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, a former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Lord Kerr who was involved with Article 50 is John Kerr, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, a career diplomat and former UK Permanent Representative to the EU. Between 2002 and 2003, before his peerage, he served as Secretary-General of the \u201cConvention on the Future of Europe\u201d, the body which drafted the text that ultimately formed the basis for the Lisbon Treaty, including Article 50.\n\nInformation wrongly describing John Kerr as one of the Supreme Court justices was also added to Wikipedia, where it was live for just over an hour.", "lang": "en"}
