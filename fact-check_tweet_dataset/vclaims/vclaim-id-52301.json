It\u2019s false.\n\nOn June 13, a netizen uploaded a screengrab of a three-month-old post by a certain Dr. Joey Montemayor who advised readers \"to sip the juice of half a calamansi fruit, drink pineapple juice and gargle warm water with salt three times a day if they have a sore throat.\" This will disable the virus, he added. The post was shared over 1,600 times.\n\n\u201cConsuming fruit juices or gargling with warm water and salt does not protect or kill COVID-19,\u201d the World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines told VERA Files, adding it \u201cdoes not recommend self-medication with any home remedies or medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nVERA Files Fact Check has debunked similar false claims that drinking water mixed with salt can supposedly kill SARS-CoV-2. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Video claiming drinking water with salt kills novel coronavirus NOT TRUE)\n\nMontemayor also claimed that the virus stays in the throat first before it destroys the lungs.\n\nTo this, WHO Philippines said there is still no confirmation of COVID-19 virus infecting the throat before the lungs. \u201cWhat is known is that upper respiratory symptoms such as sore throat and nasal congestion are less common, however, virologic studies do demonstrate shedding of virus is highest in the upper respiratory tract, including the throat, early in the course of disease,\u201d the health agency said.\n\nViral shedding refers to the discharging of the virus from the body.\n\nMontemayor\u2019s original post remains live on his account and has over 29,000 shares.", "lang": "en"}
