Nope, those details were made up by Twitter user @pixelatedboat who posted a tweet on March 26, 2018 (archived here) which contained an image with following text:\n\nInterviewer: I have to ask, what was Mr. Trump like in bed? Stormy Daniels: He was ... unusual. He told me he was a big fan of my movies. I asked if he'd like to recreate a scene from one of them. He said \"No! I'm more famous than you. We should recreate a scene from one of MY movies.\" We put our clothes on and went down to the ground floor of his building. He said \"We'll recreate my appeareance in Home Alone 2. You will play Donald Trump, and I will play that horrible child, the one that I think is dead now.\" He told me to reply \"Down the hall and to the left\" when he asked me \"Excuse me, where's the lobby?\". We did that, then he headed for the lobby. As he was walking away I heard him say \"Now I will find Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern and murder them with traps.\" I never saw him again.\n\nHere is the original tweet:\n\nOf course the whole thing is made up: you can easily check the transcript of the 60 minutes interview (archived here) with Stormy Daniels and the passage in question does not show up. It also says \"Anderson Cooper:\" throughout and not \"Interviewer:\".\n\nFor reference, here is the scene from Home Alone 2 the image in the tweet is talking about because that part really did happen, Trump had an actual cameo in the movie which starred Macaulay Culkin (who is still alive) as \"that horrible child\" and Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern as the two burglars that get caught in his traps:\n\nThis isn't the first time @pixelatedboat pretended to have found something shocking about Donald Trump in a recently released long text that many people hadn't read in full anyway:\n\nHe later admitted that one was a hoax too:", "lang": "en"}
