Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is also running for president.\n\nMultiple, popular posts on Facebook in recent days misidentify a nearly naked activist as former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThe man in the photo does not even resemble O\u2019Rourke, who announced his 2020 campaign for president on March 14. While some commenters used the posts as an opportunity to criticize O\u2019Rourke, some called out the deception for what it is.\n\n\u201cRemind everyone of this pic when this fool says he is gonna run for president,\u201d text above the photo reads. \u201cThis is Robert O\u2019Rourke (beto).\u201d\n\nThe man in the photo has words such as \u201cfeminist,\u201d \u201catheist,\u201d \u201cvegan\u201d and \u201cqueer\u201d scrawled across his body.\n\nReverse image searches on TinEye and Google led us to a June 2016 blog post about a gay pride parade in Athens, Greece, that includes an uncropped version of the same photo. We found the same image in another blog\u2019s post titled \u201cNew Queer Greece.\u201d\n\nAnother photo of the same individual on Getty Images pegs the date of the parade as June 11, 2016.\n\nO\u2019Rourke wasn\u2019t in Greece at the time: On the same day, O\u2019Rourke spoke at the El Paso High School Centennial Graduation, as a video posted on his verified Facebook page shows.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
