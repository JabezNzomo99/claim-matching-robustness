The video has also been posted on Twitter.\n\nAccording to a slightly different narrative, the people seen in the video crossing a barbed fence are members of the Hindu community who are entering India after the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Bill.\n\nThe video has also been uploaded on the official Alt News app for verification. It has also been posted with a message in TeluguTelugu which reads, \u201c\u0c05\u0c2f\u0c4b\u0c27\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c2e\u0c41\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c40\u0c2e\u0c41\u0c32\u0c15\u0c41 \u0c07\u0c1a\u0c4d\u0c1a\u0c47 5 \u0c0e\u0c15\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c32 \u0c2d\u0c42\u0c2e\u0c3f\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c05\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c21 \u0c2a\u0c46\u0c26\u0c4d\u0c26 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c02\u0c24 \u0c24\u0c35\u0c4d\u0c35\u0c41\u0c24\u0c41\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 \u0c2a\u0c41\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c24\u0c28 \u0c2e\u0c48\u0c28 \u0c39\u0c28\u0c41\u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c4d \u0c35\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c39\u0c02 \u0c2c\u0c2f\u0c1f\u0c2a\u0c21\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3f\u201d\n\nIn January 2019, News Nation had broadcast this video as, \u201cBangladeshi immigrants infiltration video from Silchar border.\u201d The channel called the clip as \u201cexclusive\u201d footage.\n\nOther YouTube channels News Liveand Prag Newsalso shared the same video in January this year with the same claim.\n\nAlt News found the video in question is not recent thus does not pertain to the recent Citizenship Amendment Bill or its possible implications. After breaking up the video into multiple frames and reverse-searching on Google, we found several similar videos posted on YouTube. These videos depict the Milon Mela, a fair organized on the India-Bangladesh border in April and December each year where families greet one another on both sides of the border. However, unlike the viral video, no one is seen crossing the fence in these videos.\n\nWith the use of the keywords \u2018Milan Mela border\u2019 and after scrolling through multiple videos, we came across the same video posted on YouTube in 2015, titled, \u2018Aboidho probes (Bangladesh to India)\u2018. It may be noted that \u2018Aboidho\u2019 in Bengali means \u2018illegal\u2019. In the description of the video, the uploader has mentioned \u2018Milon Mela 15/04/2015\u2018, thus suggesting that the video depicts the Milon Mela held in April 2015. However, Alt News could not independently ascertain this claim.\n\nThe video was posted on May 20, 2015, and has been viewed over 1.5 million times. Alt News could not ascertain why the people seen in the video are crossing the fence, or who they are. The video, however, dates back to at least May 2015 and is not recent, thus has nothing to do with the recently passed Citizenship Amendment Bill.", "lang": "en"}
