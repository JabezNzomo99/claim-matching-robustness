The STAR Ohio fund \"just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive,\" he wrote in the Oct. 5 email.\n\n \n\n Mandel went on to praise his staff for making tough decisions in the midst of an unpredictable economy. He also contrasted the fund\u2019s performance against the recent downgrade of the United States\u2019 credit rating.\n\n \n\n Given his Senate candidacy and the consistent accusations he is an absent officeholder, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Mandel\u2019s claim about his performance as treasurer.\n\n \n\n The treasurer\u2019s office directed us to its news release on Sept. 8. The release included a letter from the credit rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s, along with recent news stories about local government investment funds. Like other credit rating agencies, S&P analyzes the creditworthiness of various governments, government-backed funds and other investments.\n\n \n\n On Aug. 23, S&P sent a letter to the state affirming a AAAm rating for the STAR Ohio fund.\n\n \n\n Unfamiliar with the lower-case \"m\" attached to the rating, we looked it up under S&P\u2019s ratings definitions.\n\n \n\n The \"m\" subscript signifies a money market fund rating, which assesses the fund\u2019s ability to maintain a stable net asset value. AAAm is the highest of these ratings.\n\n \n\n \"Higher rated funds are expected to have stronger capacities to pay investor redemptions in cash during times of high market stress because they generally comprise shorter maturity and higher quality investments,\" according to S&P.\n\n \n\n Mandel is accurate in saying the fund received the highest possible rating. He also told supporters the fund \"just\" received the rating, so we wanted to check whether the rating was upgraded under Mandel, or if the fund maintained a high rating established under previous treasurers. \n\n \n\n Jeff Sexton, a spokesman for S&P, said STAR Ohio has received a AAAm rating since 1995, the first year S&P rated the fund.\n\n \n\n Although Mandel has simply maintained the high rating, a public finance expert said the treasurer deserves some credit. The highest praise, however, should be reserved for the fund managers who maintained the rating during the financial crisis in 2008, said Kevin O\u2019Brien, executive director at the Center for Public Management in the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University.\n\n \n\n \"He deserves credit for maintaining that (rating) from January until now,\" said O\u2019Brien, a former financial analyst for Moody\u2019s Investors Service, another credit rating agency. \"They maintained the bond rating; they didn't achieve the bond rating.\"\n\n \n\n We checked with Mandel\u2019s office to get an idea of how the STAR Ohio fund is managed. Spokesman Seth Unger said the office\u2019s investment department works with financial advisers to manage the fund. Unger said investments are bought and sold daily.\n\n \n\n The STAR Ohio fund did, in fact, receive the highest rating possible, as Mandel\u2019s email claimed. But the rating already had been in place for 16 years. It did not improve under Mandel, as a reasonable person might assume from his email. And while he gets some credit for maintaining the rating, his email overstated the case. \n\n \n\n Those are important details that add context. We rate the statement Half True.", "lang": "en"}
