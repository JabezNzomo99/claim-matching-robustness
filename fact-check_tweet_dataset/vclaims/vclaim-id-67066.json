It appears to have been mirrored and stretched.\n\nNearly 300 oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated by Aug. 26 in preparation for Hurricane Laura, The Associated Press reported. Hurricane Laura, which has since weakened to a tropical depression, inflicted damaging winds and flooding on the Louisiana-Texas border as it made landfall this week, killing at least 14 people, according to BBC News.\n\nMultiple Facebook users shared a video of large waves and high winds battering an oil platform, claiming it shows one of the facilities evacuated ahead of Hurricane Laura. That characterization is, however, inaccurate.

The video shows the Borgholm Dolphin installation, a platform meant to accommodate personnel, being battered by a storm in the North Sea about 145 miles from Scotland, according to BBC News and the Daily Mail.\n\nThe video being shared on Facebook appears to have been mirrored and stretched. It was also shared with a misleading caption on Twitter, where it received over 520,000 views, despite being debunked there by BuzzFeed News reporter Jane Lytvynenko.\n\nMultiple marine shipping websites list the Borgholm Dolphin installation\u2019s status as decommissioned, scrapped or lost at sea. Dolphin Drilling, which is listed as the owner of the platform on those sites, did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
