Posing alongside her is former president F.W. de Klerk. However, this image has been doctored, and not for the first time -- we\u2019ve previously debunked another version which was edited to show controversial Afrikaans musician Steve Hofmeyer in place of de Klerk.\n\n\u201cBlack woman embracing Apartheid legacy in art,\u201d reads a Facebook post sharing the image of Madonsela and de Klerk. \u201cFrom today onwards, i have lost all respect for Thuli Madonsela & strongly believe she is lost and needs serious help,\u201d it continues. We\u2019ve archived the post here.\n\nHowever, a reverse image search quickly indicates that the photo has been doctored -- it leads to the original version of the photo, as seen in a November 2017 article by Afrikaans newspaper Rapport. \u201cMystery: Who is the lady in orange, white and blue?\u201d reads the headline.\n\nAs reported in a previous debunk by AFP Fact Check, the Rapport article explains that the original photo was taken at a year-end event for members of the Advertising Media Association of Southern Africa (AMASA) on November 15, 2017.\n\nThe theme of the party was \u201cNothing is taboo in media in 2017\u201d and the dress-code, similarly, was \u201cAs Taboo As Possible\u201d.\n\nAFP spoke to the man pictured in the original, Ruan Lottering, when we debunked an earlier version of the photo back in April. He explained that the woman\u2019s outfit was a joke.\n\n\"I had a quick chat with her and I can promise you, she's not supportive of the old regime or the old flag or nothing like that and neither am I,\" said Lottering, whom we tracked down online via the Rapport article.\n\n\"She did it as a joke and I saw the joke about it and that's why we took the photo,\" he added.\n\nWe\u2019re still trying to track down the woman in the photo to hear her side of the story -- if you know her, you can get in touch here.\n\nThe image was doctored using a real photo of Madonsela and de Klerk\n\nSearching Facebook for photos including the search term \u201cMadonsela de Klerk\u201d led us to a post from February 1, 2016 published by the FW de Klerk Foundation\u2019s official Facebook page. It shows de Klerk presenting Madonsela with an award for her public service.\n\nIf the picture looks familiar to you, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve already seen these faces. Whoever doctored the \u201capartheid dress\u201d image simply mirrored the awards photo and cut out the faces to fit them into the other one.\n\nWhy the old South African flag is controversial\n\nSouth Africa adopted a new flag at the end of apartheid in 1994, and the earlier flag became synonymous with the apartheid regime. Today, it is often used by white supremacists both in South Africa and abroad.\n\nAs reported by AFP on August 21, a Johannesburg court made a landmark ruling barring the unjustified display of the old flag, saying such gestures amounted to \"hate speech\" and \"harassment\".\n\nJudge Phineas Mojapelo said that any gratuitous display of the old flag was \"racist and discriminatory\".\n\n\"It demonstrates a clear intention to be hurtful, to be harmful and incite harm and it in fact promotes and propagates hatred against black people,\u201d he said.\n\nDe Klerk, the last president of the apartheid era, released Nelson Mandela in 1990 after 27 years in prison. South Africa had become a pariah regime, under economic sanctions and increasingly isolated on the world stage.\n\nThe two politicians worked together to bring an end to the policy of racial segregation, with de Klerk serving as deputy when Mandela became president in 1994.\n\nDe Klerk\u2019s participation in the transition led to him being awarded a joint Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993.\n\nAfter stepping down as vice-president in 1996, de Klerk set up his foundation in 1999 to defend the constitution, with a focus on the rights of white minority Afrikaners and the Afrikaans-speaking \u201ccoloured\u201d community.\n\nMadonsela served as South Africa\u2019s public protector -- a role enshrined in the constitution which involves investigating potential wrongdoing in state affairs -- from 2009 to 2016.\n\nDuring her time in office, she often faced accusations that she protected \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d in her investigations into corruption allegations surrounding former president Jacob Zuma -- see this AFP report.\n\nShe tweeted in 2017 that claims that she defended white interests were trying to deflect attention from the allegations of state capture -- systemic corruption -- against Zuma.", "lang": "en"}
