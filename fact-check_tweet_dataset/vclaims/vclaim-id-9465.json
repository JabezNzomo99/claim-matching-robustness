It\u2019s a complicated project that will affect 7 million people and there have been many difficulties. It is now five years behind schedule.\n\nMore people are receiving their first Universal Credit payment on time, as we discussed last week.\n\nThe share of people who were paid an advance on their first full service Universal Credit payment has also increased. It was 30% in May 2016 and 52% in July 2017, so over half of new claimants were paid an advance.\n\nIf someone can\u2019t wait six weeks for their first payment they can apply for an advance, which they\u2019ll pay back out of future Universal Credit payments.\n\nHow much can be advanced?\n\nAdvance payments range from less than \u00a350 to over \u00a3600. They are most often around \u00a3100 to \u00a3200. They\u2019re capped at 50% of the expected monthly Universal Credit payment.\n\nThe amount also has to be repayable within six months for new claims and twelve months for people transferring from other benefits.", "lang": "en"}
