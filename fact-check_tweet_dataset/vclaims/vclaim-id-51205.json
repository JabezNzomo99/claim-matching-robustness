His estate at Monticello considers it a \u201cspurious quotation.\u201d\n\nSocial media users erroneously ascribe quotes to Jefferson so often that his estate at Monticello keeps a running list of \u201cspurious quotations.\u201d A quick internet search revealed that the quote about attitude appears on that list. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, \u2018That Government Is Best Which Governs The Least\u2019?)\n\nThe Daily Caller found no record of Jefferson ever saying or writing the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson did not yield any results, nor did a search of his collected letters and quotations.\n\n\u201cIt is also frequently attributed to W. W. Ziege, and while Ziege did write an article that appeared in Rosicrucian Digest in December 1945, \u2018The Magic Word,\u2019 in which he essentially makes the same point, he did not use these exact words,\u201d wrote Research Librarian Anna Berkes on the Monticello website. \u201cNo other writings of his in which this quotation may have appeared have yet been located.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the website Quote Investigator found a semantically-related statement in Ziege\u2019s 1945 article, though elements of the expression also appeared earlier. In the Rosicrucian Digest, Ziege wrote, \u201cChanging the mental attitude from the wrong to the right is all that people need to do to enjoy all that life has to offer.\u201d\n\nThe quote about attitude has been attributed to Jefferson since at least 1988, according to Berkes.", "lang": "en"}
