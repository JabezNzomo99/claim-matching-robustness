Medium and large manufacturers\u2019 confidence had increased to 20-year highs, but small manufacturers\u2019 confidence had decreased to 89.5 percent, from 94.5 percent in the first quarter.\n\nIn May, the NFIB\u2019s index of small-business optimism rose to the second-highest level in its 45-year history. It wasn\u2019t an \u201call-time high,\u201d as Trump claimed. \u201cThe new tax code is returning money to the private sector where history makes clear it will be better invested than by a government bureaucracy,\u201d the group said. \u201cRegulatory costs, as significant as taxes, are being reduced.\u201d\n\nThe NFIB says it has hundreds of thousands of members, 88 percent of which have no more than 19 employees. The U.S. Small Business Administration says there are 30 million small businesses in the country, accounting for nearly half of the private-sector workforce.\n\nLike the NAM survey, this index provides a narrow insight into the small-business sector. On top of that, Trump mischaracterized its findings, and the numbers weren\u2019t as favorable to the administration the following month. In June, the index fell to the sixth-highest level in 45 years.\n\nSome of them are vague, such as \u201cstrengthen enforcement\u201d by the Department of Homeland Security and \u201creform vetting of individuals seeking entry into the U.S.\u201d Heritage gave Trump credit for adopting both of them as of January 2018, even though Trump continues to complain about the high volume of southwest border apprehensions and continues to press Congress for stricter vetting measures for potential immigrants.\n\nSome of Heritage\u2019s recommendations seem like freebies, such as \u201creform the way [the Department of Defense] operates,\u201d for which Trump also got a check mark. Some of the things Trump got credit for haven\u2019t happened. Heritage gave the president credit for eliminating the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which doesn\u2019t expire until Sept. 30 and which Congress could renew. The group gave Trump preemptive credit for a number of proposals included in his budget, which had not passed when Heritage issued its report card in January.\n\nIn any event, Trump says Heritage gave him credit for \u201cimplementing\u201d \u2014 a stronger word than \u201cembracing\u201d \u2014 64 percent of his own agenda. But the group was talking about its own \u201cMandate for Leadership.\u201d (Trump has failed to deliver on many of his key campaign promises, according to our Trump Promise Tracker.)\n\nTrump also boasted that he had been implementing these ideas at a faster rate than President Reagan. The Heritage report compared Trump\u2019s 64 percent rate with Reagan\u2019s 49 percent after his first year in office. But Heritage ended up issuing 2,000 recommendations to Reagan and gave him credit for adopting or attempting \u201cnearly two-thirds.\u201d That\u2019s roughly the same as 64 percent, except 2,000 recommendations for Reagan is a much larger baseline than 334 for Trump. The Heritage Foundation did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nThese statistics \u2014 on the surface \u2014 dovetail with some of Trump\u2019s favorite talking points. But they\u2019re fleeting from one month to the next, or they\u2019re based on opaquely drawn and relatively small samples, or they come from groups known for their conservative leanings. On top of this, Trump blurs the nuance and ends up mischaracterizing what was already a dubious statistic.", "lang": "en"}
