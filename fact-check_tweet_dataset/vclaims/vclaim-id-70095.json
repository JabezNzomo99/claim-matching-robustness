After the video went viral, Belafonte\u2019s spokesperson released a statement blaming the singer\u2019s \u201cnap\u201d on a technical glitch. The spokesperson said that Belefonte\u2019s earpiece wasn\u2019t working and that the singer was meditating while the issue was being worked out:\n\n\u201cAfter weeks of literally hundreds of interviews promoting his HBO documentary, memoir and CD, Mr. Belafonte had an early morning satellite TV tour this past Friday. True to form, there was a technical glitch in the feed to a local station in Bakersfield, CA. His earpiece wasn\u2019t working, so he decided to take the time to mediate before the rest of his Day-O. Mr. Belafonte is 84 years young, but sharper and more awake than most who have been interviewing him. Maybe the world would be a better place if more people took a moment to meditate.\u201d\n\nThe clip of Biden comes from the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The manipulated footage appears to show Biden sleeping, but it\u2019s clear in the original footage that Biden was never actually asleep.\n\nThe segment used in the manipulated footage comes from the moment during the DNC in which former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton endorsed Biden for president. In the full video from C-SPAN, Biden can be seen momentarily looking downward, but it doesn\u2019t appear that he ever actually falls asleep.\n\nThe video shared by Scavino loops together a few seconds of footage from this video in which Biden either has his eyes closed or is looking downward and then plays it beneath unrelated audio of a person snoring.\n\nAlthough Scavino did help spread this manipulated footage, he didn\u2019t create it. It appears that this video was created by Twitter user @damonimani. When @damonimani was asked if this video was real on Twitter, he replied that it was \u201ctechnically\u201d real:\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how taking footage of someone who momentarily had their eyes closed, falsely claiming that they were sleeping, placing that footage into unrelated context, creating fake chyrons, adding a snoring sound effect, and then presenting the altered video as if it showed someone \u201ctaking a little nap\u201d during a live TV interview could be considered a genuine reflection of reality, technically speaking.", "lang": "en"}
