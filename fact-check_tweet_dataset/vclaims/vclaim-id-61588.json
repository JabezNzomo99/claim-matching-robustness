In 2015, it placed fifth in Forbes\u2019 annual of the world\u2019s most admired companies. The rankings are based on nine attributes, and one of Starbucks\u2019 top attributes, according to the business magazine, is social responsibility.\n\n\"Race Together\" concerns over police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Mo., and New York. In the campaign, Schultz called it \"an opportunity to begin to re-examine how we can create a more empathetic and inclusive society \u2013 one conversation at a time.\"\n\nSchultz encouraged his baristas to write \"Race Together\" on Starbucks cups and to engage in conversations while serving their customers. That after less than a week, which Starbucks was as planned, after heavy criticism. of \"Race Together\" are continuing.\n\nStarbucks hasn't confirmed it, but the family of Dontre Hamilton Schultz would be meeting with them in Milwaukee. Hamilton was by a Milwaukee officer on April 30, 2014, after Starbucks employees called police to report Hamilton sleeping in a downtown park. The officer was fired.\n\nTo back its claim about white wealth, Starbucks cited a November 2013 in the American Prospect, a liberal magazine. The author said he did calculations on net worth data from the 2010 version of the Federal Reserve System\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, a respected source.\n\nAccording to the article: Whites held 88.4 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth; Hispanics, 4 percent and blacks 2.7 percent. The remaining 4.9 percent was listed as other. That category includes Native Americans, Asians, Pacific Islanders and those with a multi-racial background.\n\nSo, that\u2019s a start. But first let\u2019s take a step back.\n\nTo be clear, wealth -- commonly measured as -- is different than income. It is the difference between a household's assets, such as savings or a home, and liabilities, such as a mortgage or a car loan. So, you can have a good-paying job but have a negative net worth, if your debts outweigh your savings.\n\nin recent years have said as many as one in four households has zero net worth or negative net worth.\n\nWe were able to get the latest and more detailed breakdown on net worth from the Federal Reserve, for 2013. The nation\u2019s net worth was $65.5 trillion and breaks down this way:\n\n\n\nAs we close, we'll note that two of our most-clicked fact checks were about disparities in wealth:\n\nIn 2011, activist and filmmaker Michael Moore said in Madison that 400 Americans \"have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.\" We .\n\nAnd in 2013, we this claim by the liberal group One Wisconsin Now: \"The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined.\"\n\nStarbucks said: \"White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth.\"\n\nThat matches the latest net worth figures from the Federal Reserve System.", "lang": "en"}
