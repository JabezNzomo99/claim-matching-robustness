Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nOn doing Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in an article by \u2018The Wall Street Journal\u2019 on Ayodhya. The description of the photo reads, \u201cA photograph of the Babri Masjid from the early 1900s\u201d. So, the photo is related to the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.\n\n\n\nOn doing Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found on the Haryana Tourism website. On the website, it can be found that the photo is related to \u2018Kabuli Bagh Mosque\u2019 (Panipat). So, the photo is not related to the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. \n\n\n\nOn doing Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in the articles published by India TV (Archived), Bloomberg-Quint (Archived) and Telangana Today (Archived). It can also be found that the \u2018Quint\u2019 has made an infographic and a video on Ayodhya with the same picture.\n\nBut, the same picture was also found with the title: \u2018Jama Masjid, Kalaburagi Fort (Karnataka)\u2019, on the Britannica website. So, when searched with the keywords on Google, a similar photo was also found on the Alamy website with the following description: \u2018Kalburagi fort, view of Jamia Mosque, Gulbarga, Karnataka\u2019. It can be concluded that the photo is not related to the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.\n\nOn doing Yandex Reverse Image Search, a colored-photo of the same monument was found on a travel website. On that website, it was found that the photo is related to \u2018Ibrahim Rouza, Bijapur (Karnataka)\u2019. Similar photos can be also found on the \u2018Flickr\u2019 when searched with the keywords \u2018Ibrahim Rouza Arches\u2019. So, the photo is not related to the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.\n\nOn doing Yandex Reverse Image Search, a similar photo from another angle was found on the \u2018Archnet\u2019 website. On that website, it can read that the photo was taken in the \u2018Ye\u015fil Cami\u2019 mosque (Turkey). A similar colour photo taken recently can be found on the \u2018Shutterstock\u2019 website. So, the photo is not related to the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.\n\nTo sum it up, except one, no other photo is related to the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
