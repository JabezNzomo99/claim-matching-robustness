Discretionary spending is controlled by lawmakers through annual appropriation acts. Mandatory spending is generally based on program parameters, such as those for Social Security and Medicare, without specific amounts being appropriated each year.\n\n \n\n Discretionary spending represents nearly 40 percent of all federal outlays, and is comprised of defense and non-defense items.\n\n \n\n Over the last decade, military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have largely contributed to the growth in defense spending, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Non-defense spending has increased during Obama\u2019s tenure, in part, because of the stimulus bill he approved in February 2009, the budget office said.\n\n \n\n Since Booker\u2019s claim refers to discretionary spending in general, we\u2019ll look at the total amount.\n\n \n\n In fiscal year 2010 -- Obama\u2019s first complete fiscal year as president -- discretionary spending hit 9.4 percent of GDP, marking the highest amount since fiscal year 1987. In fiscal year 2011, which ended last September, discretionary spending dropped to 9 percent.\n\n \n\n Before fiscal years 2010 and 2011, discretionary spending had not reached 9 percent since fiscal year 1991.\n\n \n\n In a deal to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, Obama and Congress agreed last summer to set caps on certain types of future discretionary spending. Due in large part to those caps, discretionary spending is projected to reach historic lows in the years ahead.\n\n \n\n According to the White House, discretionary spending would fall to 5.9 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2016, marking the lowest level since at least the early 1960s. The Congressional Budget Office has offered slightly different estimates, placing discretionary spending at 6.5 percent in fiscal year 2016 and 5.9 percent in fiscal year 2019.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n In his May 20 appearance on NBC\u2019s \"Meet The Press,\" Booker cited a couple of Obama\u2019s accomplishments, including \"the lowest discretionary spending we\u2019ve had in decades in the United States.\"\n\n \n\n But during Obama\u2019s tenure, discretionary spending hit 9 percent of GDP for the first time in about two decades. Discretionary spending is projected to drop significantly in the years ahead, but Booker made it sound like that had already occurred.\n\n \n\n We rate the statement False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
