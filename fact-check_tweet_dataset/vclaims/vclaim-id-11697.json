Sacrificing your sleep for the betterment of this country.. But you will never receive appreciation for the same. You will still be blamed for small silly issues.. ,\" the viral post says.\n\nHowever, a fact check shows that the open letter was not written by Arnab Goswami and goes back to at least 2015. While some have attributed the post to Hindutva rabble rousing page Shankhnaad, the post is much older. Shankhnaad has been caught spreading false, communally motivated and malicious posts several times in the past. (Read here, here and here)\n\nThe viral post was even reported by the newspaper DNA in March 2016 but a search shows it has existed online in 2015 as well.\n\nThe letter makes a reference to the results in Bihar. \"See the Bihar results.. They have chosen 8,9 and 12th standard passed/failed candidates.. But not the ones who represented you,\" the post says suggesting it could have been written post November 2015 .\n\nIt is not clear who is the author of the post.", "lang": "en"}
