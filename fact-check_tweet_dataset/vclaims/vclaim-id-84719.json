The footage that is being widely shared on social media, juxtaposes a 2013 clip of Ravish Kumar\u2019s show on 5% GDP growth with a recent broadcast on the same topic. The video purporting to expose Kumar\u2019s \u2018hypocrisy\u2019 carries his quote, \u201cIt is very difficult to keep your values safe\u201d (translated).\n\nIn the 2013 video, Kumar can be heard saying, \u201cAre we being too critical or sad about the economy? There are many countries in the world which are growing at a rate less than 5%\u201d (translated). The 2019 video he can be heard saying, \u201cThe economy is not in a good condition. Despite efforts to hide it, the GDP figures today have exposed the wounds. The 5% figure confirms that it is in grips of a slowdown.\u201d (translated)\n\nDoes the 35-second viral clip accurately represent Kumar\u2019s views on economic slow? Did the journalist not criticise the Congress government when the GDP was at 5% in 2013?\n\nThe 2013 video is clipped to present a misleading picture. The broadcast is of February 2013 when dismal growth numbers were revealed in the Economic Survey. Alt News accessed the full video and found that Kumar actually started his introduction in a manner almost identical to how he started the same in 2019. Here is what he said:\n\n\u201cThe economy of the country is not in a good state. It is expected to recover in the future. Compared to the past when it was growing between 8 and 9%, now every indicator points to a slowdown. Manufacturing, agriculture all show a slowdown. Even our flagship service sector has fallen to 6.6% meaning tourism, hotels, etc all are not growing.\u201d\n\nHe then goes on to quote figures from the economic survey to ask if the Indian economy which was regarded as a \u2018tiger\u2019 is now better described as a \u2018lamb\u2019? He concludes his introduction, with the words that were clipped and shared on social media, i.e., \u201care we being too critical or sad about the economy? There are many countries in the world which are growing at a rate less than 5%. These are the aspects we will discuss on prime time today.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the full video here.\n\nIt is clear that Ravish Kumar\u2019s full introduction on the state of the economy as revealed by the 2013 Economic Survey was maliciously clipped to present a completely misleading picture.\n\nRavish Kumar was active on Twitter in 2013 and on the day the program was telecast, he had commented on the Economic Survey results saying, \u201cEconomic or uneconomic condition.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the clipped video has been extensively shared by several journalists from other media houses, some of whom ironically have their own fact-checking cells.\n\nAlt News has debunked several instances of misinformation spread about him in the past. This clipped video is one more addition to the long list.", "lang": "en"}
