Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that claim. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of public chasing away Policemen in Assam after publishing the final list of National Register of Citizens (NRC). Fact: Video shows \u2018Maratha Quota\u2019 protesters chasing away Policemen in Aurangabad (Maharashtra). So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video in the post were searched using Yandex reverse image technique, the search result of a YouTube news channel \u2018Policenama News\u2019 was found to have similar footage. From the description of the news video, it was found that during \u2018Maratha Reservation\u2019 protests in Aurangabad, the Policemen were chased away by the protestors. So, with that information when searched on Google with keywords \u2018Maratha protests angry people chase away police in Aurangabad\u2019, a news video of \u2018India Today\u2019 with similar visuals as that of the video in the post was found. The information from that news video corroborated that the video is related to \u2018Maratha Reservation\u2019 protests in Aurangabad (Maharashtra). \n\n\n\nThe National Register of Citizens (NRC) is the list of Indian citizens in Assam. From the \u2018DD News\u2019 article, it was found that the final NRC list of Assam was published on 31 August 31 2019, and it had excluded 19 lakh people.\n\nTo conclude, 2018 video of Maratha Protests in Aurangabad is being falsely shared as \u2018angry public chasing away Police in Assam after NRC\u2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
