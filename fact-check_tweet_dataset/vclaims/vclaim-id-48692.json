BOOM found that the man is not a police personnel but endodontist Prashant Tripathi based in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Tripathi has also acted in Hindi television serials.\n\n\n\nThe 70-second-long video shows the man speaking animatedly to the camera. A Hindi caption with the clip reads 'Believe in Hindutva. Take pride in Hindutva. Hindutva is not a religion, Hindutva is a scientific way of life. An IPS officer's enthusiastic message to the country. Praise be on India, Vandematram. Now some people will start crying foul.'\n\nIn the video, the man dressed in khaki uniform can be heard saying 'Vandematram. When we said namastey, they laughed. They laughed when we performed yoga. When we worshiped our flora and fauna, even then they laughed. Even when we respected out elders, they laughed. Even washing our hands and feet before eating made them laugh. Our vegetarian diet got their laughs. When we cremated our dead ones, they made fun of us. But, it's surprising that now no one's laughing. The 260 countries across the world have taken up namastey today. And this namastey makes us feel the strength of this country. We are Hindutva. Take pride in Hindutva. Trust Hindutva. Hindutva is a way of life based on science. You and I are Hindutva and we will keep the foundation of this country. With the slogan of Vandeymatram and bharat mata ki jai, we will take this country and the world forward. Corona will go one day, don't worry, believe in Hindutva, the lost glory of this country will come back. Bharat mata ki jai, Vandeymatram, jai hind. Thank you.'\n\nWatch the video below and access its archived version here.\n\nThe clip comes in the backdrop of Coronavirus outbreak when fear of getting infected has led to many people avoiding bodily contact, in the way of handshakes and hugs, while greeting each other.\n\nBOOM traced the viral video clip to the Facebook profile of Prashant Tripathi who had shared a celebratory post on March 20 regarding the same video.
