We have learnt a lot from the conduct of the last general elections. Vital lessons have been learnt from our interactions with Stakeholders, on how we can improve on our efforts.\n\n\u201cIn all facets of our duties as Electoral Umpires, we are determined to improve on Electoral processes in the country, using the lessons we have learnt from the last general elections.\n\n\u201cAfter each election, plans for the next election should promptly commence. That is what we are doing now, as we pursue our determination to improve the Electoral processes in future\u201d, Yakubu said.\n\nIn verifying this, we searched the Twitter Handle of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and found the closest information to ascertain the veracity of the claim.\n\nThe tweet contained a video of Mahmood Yakubu, INEC\u2019s Chairman, addressing the Resident Electoral Commission and in the said video, none of the quoted words were present. This took place at the 12th post-election meeting held in Ikeja, Lagos on July 11th.\n\nAfter the salutations and observation of protocols, the INEC Chairman said:\n\n\u201cYou would recall that we promised to undertake a comprehensive review of the 2019 general elections internally by way of self-appraisal and externally through wide-ranging consultations with stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIn the last one and a half months, we had 11 meetings in Abuja and Lagos on the 2019 general elections. Today\u2019s interaction with the Resident Electoral Commissioners is the 12th meeting so far.\n\n\u201cAt the end of these series of meetings and consultations, we are convinced that the Commission will learn vital lessons on the conduct of general elections \u2013 successes, challenges and the way forward.\n\n\u201cWe consider these necessary because as a Commission, we are committed to the improvement of the nation\u2019s electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that immediately after the conclusion of one election, planning for the next election should quickly be in earnest. This is precisely what we are doing in this series of engagement,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nThere is no evidence to show that INEC\u2019s chairman begged Nigerians and admitted to a bad or manipulated election. This is, therefore, FALSE!\n\nHere\u2019s our note to readers: If you see a news report about an event (a meeting) that does not provide clear details about that event; or you see a story with such a compelling headline (headlines that evoke emotions) and the content seems so different, as in this case, DO NOT believe or share!", "lang": "en"}
