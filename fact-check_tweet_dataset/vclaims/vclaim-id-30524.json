But they specifically zeroed in on a chemical called\n\nGlyphosate is sprayed on commercially grown food crops that are genetically engineered to resist its effects. So while spraying it with glyphosate kills weeds, it does not kill the crops. (\n\nThe IFP wrote that because the World Health Organisation classified glyphosate as \u201c\n\n\u201d (cancer-causing), \u201cSouth Africa is feeding its people toxins, thus feeding the cancer pandemic\u201d.\n\nDoes glyphosate contribute to cancer in humans? And if so, does glyphosate occur at high enough levels in South Africa\u2019s food crops to likely cause cancer?\n\nCentral to the IFP\u2019s complaint is the 2015 classification by the WHO\u2019s\n\u2022 Group 1. Things that cause cancer in humans, for example, tobacco smoke.\n\u2022 Group 2:\n\u2022 2A. Things that \u201cprobably\u201d cause cancer, for example, the former pesticide DDT,\n\u2022 2B. Things that are \u201cpossibly\u201d cancer-causing, mainly lab chemicals.\n\u2022 Group 3. Things that cannot be classified as whether they can cause cancer or not, for example, caffeine,\n\u2022 Group 4. Things that \u201cprobably do not\u201d cause cancer in humans. \n\n\n\nSo according to this classification scheme, glyphosate\u2019s potential to cause cancer in humans is quite high.\n\nThe evidence in humans was from\n\n, mostly agricultural, in the USA, Canada and Sweden. It showed some evidence of a link between glyphosate and a cancer of the immune system called\n\n\u201cBear in mind, this evaluation is based mainly on environmental exposures, meaning farmers who have been exposed to glyphosate through their jobs,\u201d Vernique Terrase, a press officer at the International Agency for Research on cancer, explained to Africa Check. \u201cTherefore, we cannot comment on the exposure due to food residue.\u201d\n\non glyphosate and cancer. While there was some evidence in isolated studies of a link between non-Hodgkin lymphoma and exposure to glyphosate, this disappeared in studies of large groups of people.\n\nThe joint meeting also evaluated studies where animals were fed the equivalent of glyphosate\n\n. Even at levels 2,000 times higher than that there was no cancer-causing effect in the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of animal studies conducted.\n\nThe joint meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a cancer risk to humans when they are exposed to it either through food or farming.\n\nWhy the different conclusions?\n\nWhile the two conclusions may seem to contradict each other, they looked at different issues,\n\nfrom the pest and pesticide management team at the FAO explained.\n\nThe difference is that the first finding was based on a \u201chazard evaluation\u201d, which looked at how likely the pure form of a substance is to cause harm to individual people, whereas the second finding rested on a \u201crisk assessment\u201d, which measured the effects of the day-to-day exposure to the substance.\n\nBaogen said that as long as there is less than 5 mg of glyphosate per kilogramme of maize and less than 20 mg/kg of soya - the maximum residual limits set by the FAO - humans would be fine when eating glyphosate-containing crops.\n\nAre South Africans exposed to glyphosate in food?\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s department of health has set a maximum glyphosate limit of 2 mg/kg in maize and 10 mg/kg in soya, below the international limits. The deputy director in the department\u2019s directorate of food control, Maryke Herbst,\n\n40 samples of maize meal in 2012/13, \u201cno glyphosate was detected\u201d, the director of forensic pathology services at the department of health, Alida Grove, told Africa Check. We requested the results but the department did not provide them.\n\nGiven glyphosate\u2019s \u201clower risk profile\u201d and that \u201cin general\u201d the maximum limits have not been exceeded, the health department \u201chas not prioritised glyphosate as a high risk active that needs to be frequently monitored\u201d, director of communications, Ria Grobler, told us. She also told us that the department would, from time to time, reassess this situation.\n\nThe department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries\u2019 Thilivali Nepfumbada told us the department does\n\nnot check for glyphosate in maize or soya sold to consumers \u201cbecause that is beyond our mandate and is a food safety issue\u201d.\n\nNepfumbada said the department\u2019s role is mainly in ensuring that pesticides are used properly - looking at how they are chemically made, what labels are on them, whether farmers are using them as recommended and how they are stored.\n\nConclusion: Claim unlikely to be true\n\nWhile the World Health Organisation\u2019s cancer agency stated that glyphosate was \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d based on studies of individual people exposed to the chemical, a comprehensive review of studies looking at its effect on animals and humans later found that glyphosate was unlikely to cause cancer.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s department of health limits the amount of glyphosate to less than 2 mg/kg in maize and 10 mg/kg in soya, roughly half of what the internationally accepted maximum limits are. However, the health department generally does not see the potential harm from glyphosate as a \u201chigh priority\u201d risk and therefore only conducts tests from time to time.\n\nIn 2012/13, the health department\u2019s forensic chemistry laboratory detected no glyphosate in food samples tested.\n\nStill, without regular testing and publicly available information about glyphosate levels in food, the claim that South Africa may be \u201cfeeding its people cancer-causing toxins\u201d is difficult to reject completely.\n\nActivists dressed as crop-sprayers protest EU plans to relicense glyphosate, the controversial weed-killer, in May 2016.
