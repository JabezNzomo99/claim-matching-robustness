A herpetologist confirmed the photo is fake.\n\nThe image shows what appears to be a snake with seven heads on the side of a road. In the background, a group of people can be seen standing by a truck while they look at the snake and take pictures of it.\n\n\u201cThis snake was found in the mountains of Honduras,\u201d reads the image\u2019s caption. \u201cAnd the Bible speaks of a snake with 7 heads and with this we see that it is fulfilling everything that is written.\u201d\n\nBut the image has been digitally manipulated. A reverse image search reveals the picture is a photoshopped version of a normal, one-headed snake. The Daily Mail includes the original photo next to the altered photo. \u201cThe seven heads are clearly the same image copied and pasted: the lighting is all wrong and there are sharp edges surrounding the snake\u2019s heads,\u201d the Daily Mail notes.\n\nWhile it is rare, animals can sometimes be born with two or even three heads. The phenomenon, known as polycephaly, has been witnessed in numerous species, according to BBC News. Lori Neuman-Lee, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Arkansas State University, told the Seattle Times that it is \u201cmore common in snakes than other species, but it is certainly not common.\u201d\n\nThe phenomenon is so rare that when a polycephalic creature is discovered, it is often covered in the media. For example, Minnesota local ABC affiliate KSTP reported about a two-headed goat being born on a Wisconsin farm in April. There don\u2019t appear to be any credible media reports about seven-headed snakes, further adding to the image\u2019s dubiousness.
