The Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any record of countries using mass sea burials for deceased coronavirus victims.\n\nThe video shows bodies washing ashore on an unidentified coastline and includes text that reads: \u201cSome countries throw Covid19 (sic) infected dead bodies into the seas.
