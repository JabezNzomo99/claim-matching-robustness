A screenshot of a graphic showing the breakdown of foreign assistance for Marawi accompanied the screenshot of the headline.\n\nThe facts: The COA did not say the Duterte administration is \"keeping\" 99.6% of foreign aid for Marawi. What the COA did flag in its 2017 audit is the administration's failure to utilize P74.55 billion (or 99.6%) out of a total P74.85 billion in Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan commitments from foreign lenders.\n\nSection 2 of RA 8182 says that ODA is a loan or grant contracted with foreign governments with whom the Philippines has diplomatic, trade relations, or bilateral agreements. It typically contains a grant element of at least 25%, or the percentage of reduction enjoyed by the borrower in debt service payments.\n\nThe COA also flagged underutilization of donations for the Marawi conflict. In its 2018 report, the COA called the attention of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) for spending only P10,000 out of P36.9 million in donations.\n\nMeanwhile, the figures listed on the graphic of foreign assistance for the Marawi conflict are indeed the tally of figures donated to the Philippines, in September 2017. (READ: Foreign assistance for Marawi now at P2.1 billion)\n\nThe article with Blaza's byline was published on the website Taxial.com. Vera Files previously fact checked the article in September 2018; the article is, however, no longer accessible on the website.", "lang": "en"}
