But Ms Burley was incorrect to say that Norway is not in the single market. It is their place in the single market that means they follow freedom of movement rules.\n\nWhat is the single market?\n\nThe single market refers the trading area in the EU. EU states are members and have to follow all the market\u2019s rules, principally the free movement of goods, people, services and capital.\n\nIn addition, members of the European Economic Area (EEA) align their rules to the single market and so are essentially part of it. This includes Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.\n\nThe UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, but remains a member of the single market during the transition period.\n\nIs Norway in the single market?\n\nNorway is part of the single market, which is why it follows the four freedoms. Ms Burley was wrong to suggest otherwise.\n\nLater in the interview, Ms Burley seemed to correct herself by saying, \u201cNorway are not in the European Union, as I\u2019ve said, and they have free movement of people.\u201d This statement is true. Norway is not in the EU. It is only in the single market.\n\nMs Abbott is correct to say that once the UK leaves the single market, freedom of movement no longer applies.\n\nAfter Ms Burley corrects herself and suggests she has been referring to the EU, and not the single market, all along, Ms Abbott then changes her previously correct statement, saying \u201conce we actually leave the EU, freedom of movement falls.\u201d\n\nThis is technically incorrect. The UK has already left the EU and still has freedom of movement.\n\nThe UK could also keep free movement of people with the EU after the end of the transition period, as part of a future trade deal with the EU.\n\nHowever this is not and has never been the government\u2019s plan. It would require the UK to negotiate with the EU to stay in the single market.", "lang": "en"}
