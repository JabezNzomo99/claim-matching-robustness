Originally meant as a tool to help smokers quit smoking, e-cigarettes have instead made their way into children\u2019s hands. With \u201cmore than 2 million US teenagers\u201d now using e-cigarettes, the FDA has labelled vaping an epidemic. While e-cigarette manufacturers have denied targeting their products at children, it is also clear that many e-cigarettes have been designed with packaging and flavours which appeal to teenagers.\n\nE-cigarettes are relatively new, therefore their long-term impact on health is not well-established. A study has reported that toxic and potentially carcinogenic substances are present within e-cigarette vapour, although fewer than in combustible cigarettes[1]. Besides toxic chemicals, the nicotine in many e-cigarettes also presents another health issue. Aside from addiction \u2013 potentially acting as a gateway to future drug use \u2013 nicotine is also associated with cardiovascular problems (e.g. high blood pressure). These findings have led health authorities and professionals to express significant concerns about the popularity of e-cigarette among teenagers[2].\n\nIn general, reviewers agreed that e-cigarettes cause harm to the lungs and cardiovascular systems. However, opinions differed as to the degree of harm to both systems, and the safety of e-cigarettes relative to combustible cigarettes.\n\nE-cigarettes were originally developed as a smoking cessation aid. They work by heating a liquid (also called e-liquid, e-juice) within a cartridge, producing a vapour that is inhaled like conventional cigarettes. Like other smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches, e-cigarette liquid commonly (but not always) includes nicotine.\n\nE-cigarette liquid also contains many other chemicals, especially for flavoured versions designed to make vaping more pleasant. Some of these chemicals can also undergo changes upon heating, producing various by-products, not unlike combustible cigarettes. However, a study has shown that the toxic by-products in e-cigarette vapour are fewer in number and lower in concentration[1]. This suggests that they would cause less harm to smokers than combustible cigarettes, and therefore serve as a useful harm reduction tool.\n\nHowever, less harm does not equate to being harmless. People who smoke e-cigarettes will still be exposed to more toxic chemicals and carcinogens than those who do not smoke at all. The effect of these chemicals on health in the long run is still unknown. This is the main issue driving the debate and concern about e-cigarettes\u2019 health effects: its growing popularity in people who would otherwise not be smoking, such as teenagers.\n\nConsistent with the finding of toxic chemicals in e-cigarette vapour[1], a study by Rubinstein et al. found significantly higher levels of various chemicals such as acrylonitrile and acrylamide in the urine of adolescents using e-cigarettes compared to non-smoking adolescents[15]. Acrylonitrile has been classified as a possible carcinogen (cancer-causing substance) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, while acrylamide has been linked to neurological damage[16].\n\nExperiments using human and mouse cells grown in culture medium also showed that e-cigarette vapour can cause changes in DNA and prevent DNA from being repaired after damage[17,18]. Such DNA changes can be a precursor to cancer, although it is also important to keep in mind that these in vitro tests may not reflect exactly what happens in a human body, as discussed in this Guardian article.\n\nThe ill-effects of conventional cigarette smoking on the respiratory tract is well-established, but no conclusive evidence yet links e-cigarette use to respiratory disorders[10]. Some studies conducted on human lung cells and mice found that e-cigarette vapour caused oxidative stress and inflammatory responses[3,4]. A study involving a telephone survey on adults about e-cigarette use found an association between e-cigarette use and diagnosis of asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)[19]. An ongoing study in the US also found wheezing to be associated with e-cigarette use[20], although the study did not take into account certain factors that could have contributed to wheezing (such as diet and physical activity levels). Furthermore, neither of these studies prove that a cause-and-effect relationship between vaping and respiratory disorders exists.\n\nOn the flip side, a study conducted in Italy evaluated COPD symptoms in smokers who had switched to e-cigarettes. This study showed that COPD symptoms were significantly improved as a result of reduced combustible cigarette consumption[21]. This is in keeping with the idea of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction tool. However, the study did not evaluate whether complete cessation of smoking (with combustible cigarettes or e-cigarettes) would improve COPD symptoms as well \u2013 if not better \u2013 nor how e-cigarettes would compare next to other smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches (which do not contain the toxic chemicals found in e-cigarette vapour) in alleviating COPD symptoms.\n\nThe Italian study illustrates e-cigarettes\u2019 potential as a smoking cessation aid, and how it could improve the health of heavy smokers by allowing them to switch to a relatively less toxic form of smoking. However, the success of e-cigarettes in helping people to actually quit smoking is still debated among researchers \u2013 a systematic literature review[22] showed how some studies found an improvement in quitting, while others did not.\n\nIn summary, short-term use of e-cigarettes certainly appears to be less harmful than using combustible cigarettes, suggesting that e-cigarettes could be a useful harm reduction tool. However, a clear picture of long-term health effects from vaping has yet to emerge, since e-cigarettes are relatively new. Recent studies show that dangerous chemicals are present in e-cigarettes and that short-term exposure to e-cigarette vapours are detrimental to DNA integrity and cellular stress. These findings strongly indicate that vaping is unlikely to be completely harmless. Ultimately, people who do not smoke in the first place would be better off not picking up a vaping habit at all.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Goniewicz et al. (2014).
