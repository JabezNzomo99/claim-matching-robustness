This is the amount the government expects to spend in the 2019/20 financial year.\n\nIt\u2019s also correct to say this is a record high, both in cash terms and real terms (once you adjust for inflation).\n\nThe problem is that these figures aren\u2019t very useful in telling whether state spending is relatively high or low, historically speaking, as the country\u2019s economy and population has changed a lot over the years.\n\nThat\u2019s why the better measure to use when looking at public spending over time is public spending as a percentage of the size of the economy as a whole.\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that public spending in 2019/20 will amount to 40% of the total UK economy.\n\nThat\u2019s not a record high. The state has been relatively bigger than it is now during various points in the past hundred years, notably during the Second World War when the UK government planned the economy as part of the war effort.\n\nMr McKinstry also writes that funding for the NHS, schools and pensions has increased significantly in recent years.\n\nSchool spending in England in 2018/19 totalled around \u00a350 billion.\n\nHowever the most meaningful way to look at school spending is not the total spend but the spend per pupil which is now 8% lower than it was in 2009/10. Government commitments to increase education spending over the next few years will take spending per pupil back up to that 2009/10 level by 2022/23.\n\nHealth spending in England has increased in recent years, though it has increased for almost the entire history of the NHS. This is partly because demand for healthcare has continued to grow as the population grows and ages.\n\nIn 2018, then-Prime Minister Theresa May announced a funding increase for the NHS in England, averaging 3.4% per year until 2023/24.\n\nThis was welcomed by health think tanks the Nuffield Trust, Health Foundation and King\u2019s Fund, and others like the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), who have said that the money will allow the NHS to \u201chelp stem further decline in the health service\u201d.\n\nBut they said that increases of at least 4% a year on average are needed in order to meet the NHS\u2019s needs and see any improvement in its services.\n\nOn pensions the picture is complex.\n\nThe state pension has increased in recent years due to the decision in 2010 by the coalition government to bring in the \u201ctriple lock\u201d, meaning the state pension increases each year by earnings, prices or 2.5%\u2014whichever is highest.\n\nThe amount of money spent on pensioner benefits in total has increased by around \u00a38 billion since 2010, but since 2014 has remained fairly stable in real terms at around \u00a3128 billion per year.\n\nDeputy Director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies Carl Emmerson told us: \u201cThe triple lock has, since 2010, pushed up pensioner benefit spending substantially in real terms. But in the other direction the increases in the state pension age for women and, more recently, men will have cut it.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the government has increased the average amount a pensioner will receive, but reduced the number of pensioners by increasing the pension age.", "lang": "en"}
