{"title": "MISLEADING: P185 total cost of processing land titles in DENR", "subtitle": "The misleading post was originally circulated in July 2018 and had already been called out by the DENR as 'incomplete, misleading, and erroneous'", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Mar 8, 2019 8:15 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-28784", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/misleading-total-cost-processing-land-titles-denr", "vclaim": "The caption of the post reads: \u201cSa mga nagbabalak magpatitulo ng lupa, basahin niyo po ito bago kayo maloko! Singkwenta pesos (Php 50.00) lang ang bayad sa pagpapatitulo ng lupa sa DENR. (Reference: CARAGA New DENR Regional Director, Charlie E. Fabre) or package: PHP185.00 -- including the application fee, stamp, and clearance. Di kailangan magbayad ng 10,000 or 20,000. Walang bayad ang survey dahil binabayaran at pinapasahod ng gobyerno ang surveyor. This is the new information that the new DENR wants the people to know!\u201d\n\nThe \u201cpackage fee\u201d of P185 refers to \"necessary fees such as documentary stamps, clearances, and affidavits from other agencies which must be paid and secured during or prior to the process of filing an application.\" These fees still apply as of this writing, LMB's Chief of Staff Erma Quirimit confirmed to Rappler.\n\nMeanwhile, the simplified figures must not be mistaken to cover the whole cost of processing land titles. Processing land titles does not end with application fees, stamps, and clearances. Talabis added that some factors such as the type of land and patent being applied for, as well as the mode of transfer of ownership like inheritance, donation, and purchase, will have to be taken into consideration in the overall cost of securing a land title.\n\nOn the claim that an applicant does not need to pay as much as P20,000 to surveyors, Talabis clarified that because the DENR has limited manpower and budget allocated for subdivision survey activities, the agency only offers services on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis. Those who cannot be accommodated may opt for the services of private geodetic engineers.", "lang": "en"}
