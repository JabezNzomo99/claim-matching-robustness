The Austrian embassy told us that it will be very soon.\n\nBut there are a couple of reasons that it\u2019s not accurate to say, as Mr Putin reportedly did, that the court released the defendant as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nFor one thing, his conviction for a separate offence\u2014serious sexual abuse of a minor\u2014was deemed \u201cwatertight\u201d, according to Austrian broadcaster OFT. The country\u2019s Ministry of Justice confirmed this to us. It isn\u2019t mentioned by the Mail.\n\nUnder the Austrian Penal Code, the more serious crime of rape involves \u201cforce\u201d. Bernhard Heinzl, an associate at Vienna law firm Dorda Brugger Jordis, told us that the issue in the case was whether or not force was applied. The lower court hadn\u2019t clearly established that there was an element of force in the case\u2014so while the sexual abuse conviction stood, the rape charge didn\u2019t.\n\nThat may explain why the decision was reported to be about whether or not the victim \u201csaid no\u201d. In Austria, as in some other European countries, the crime of rape is about force rather than lack of consent.\n\nMr Putin portrayed the court\u2019s concerns being that the defendant didn\u2019t speak German and didn\u2019t know that the victim objected to the rape. That seems like a misunderstanding, as those aren\u2019t reasons in themselves to set aside a rape conviction.\n\nThere will now be a retrial on the rape charge, and the defendant reportedly remains in jail in the meantime.\n\nThis is similar to what might happen in the UK if a conviction is set aside for legal reasons. Even if the facts don\u2019t change\u2014and in this case, the defendant confessed\u2014the legal process sometimes needs to be re-run if it was handled incorrectly the first time.\n\nMr Heinzl points out that, in the circumstances of this case, the sentence that can be given for rape is similar to what might be expected for serious sexual abuse of a minor.\n\nThe EU\u2019s 'East StratCom Task Force' has said that Russian media reporting of the case as an acquittal, and Mr Putin\u2019s reference to it, is an example of \u201cpro-Kremlin disinformation\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
