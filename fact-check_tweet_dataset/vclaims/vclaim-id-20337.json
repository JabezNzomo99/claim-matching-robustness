According to the \u201csatirical\u201d TheLast LineOfDefense.org, Goldberg was \u201chumiliated, handcuffed and dragged out of the TV studio\u201d after being arrested by federal officials:\n\nGoldberg has been breeding Pugs, French Bulldogs, Sharpeis and Shitzus from the same sets of parents for nearly 25 years, replacing mom or dad in the line with a son or daughter when she lost one. Veterinary experts say the dogs being produced might look cute, but they are a fragile mess waiting to snap at the first real sign of stress in their lives.\n\nLike everything else The Last Line of Defense publishes, the story is false, as explained in its blisteringly disdainful disclaimer:\n\nIn a cynical world where the news of the day often seems fake, The Last Line of Defense offers today\u2019s busy conservative a place to go to read things they\u2019ll enjoy and congregate with a bunch of people they agree with. So while everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction, we are proud to present it to those who will have called it real anyway.\n\nGoldberg, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, has been repeatedly portrayed in a false light throughout 2017 by various dubious and disreputable web sites and publications.\n\nAs far as her connection to animals, Goldberg has shown an affinity for animals in need: in 2011 she adopted a cat that had been reportedly thrown out of a car window by its previous owners, and in 2015 she took in a blind and deaf dog, Bear, after he was featured in a segment on her show. She has not used either the cat or the dog to start a puppy mill.", "lang": "en"}
