He also said he didn\u2019t \u201chave a simple answer for it at this stage\u201d.\n\nThose who didn\u2019t see the detail of Mr Corbyn\u2019s comments may have got a stronger impression from some of the wider news headlines. The Times reported \u201cLabour promises to write off graduate debt\u201d, and iNews reported \u201cJeremy Corbyn: Labour will write off graduate debt\u201d\u2014specifying in the detail of the article that it was something Mr Corbyn had \u201csuggested\u201d.\n\nOther Labour figures during the election campaign did hint that abolishing\u2014as opposed to reducing\u2014debt was the policy.\n\nDuring the interview Mr Corbyn is quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we want to get rid of student fees altogether ... \u201cWe\u2019ll do it as soon as we get in, and we\u2019ll then introduce legislation to ensure that any student going from the 2017-18 academic year will not pay fees. They will pay them, but we\u2019ll rebate them when we\u2019ve got the legislation through \u2013 that\u2019s fundamentally the principle behind it. \u201cYes, there is a block of those that currently have a massive debt, and I\u2019m looking at ways that we could reduce that, ameliorate that, lengthen the period of paying it off, or some other means of reducing that debt burden ... \u201cI don\u2019t have the simple answer for it at this stage \u2013 I don\u2019t think anybody would expect me to, because this election was called unexpectedly; we had two weeks to prepare all of this \u2013 but I\u2019m very well aware of that problem ... \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see why those that had the historical misfortune to be at university during the \u00a39,000 period should be burdened excessively compared to those that went before or those that come after. I will deal with it.\u201d\n\nSome Labour figures have sown confusion about the policy\n\nBoth Jeremy Corbyn and the Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, said in interviews after the election that abolishing student debt was never promised, but that it was a \u201creal ambition\u201d. The Shadow Education Secretary, Angela Rayner, also told MPs that this was never the promise.\n\nDuring the election, however, some Labour figures seemed to have sown confusion about the policy.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow justice minister Imran Hussain said in a video that \u201cevery existing student will have all their debts wiped off\u201d. Another shadow minister, Sharon Hodgson, tweeted that \u201cLabour could write off historic student debts| All those in early 20's with student debt\u201d.\n\nThe first doesn\u2019t say that graduates would also have their debts wiped off, and the second doesn\u2019t say the pledge is a certainty. Nevertheless, compared to Mr Corbyn\u2019s \u201clooking at ways that we could reduce that, ameliorate that, lengthen the period of paying it off, or some other means of reducing that debt burden\u201d, both interventions could have given voters the wrong idea about what was being promised.", "lang": "en"}
