These include things like agriculture, housing and education.\n\nOther powers are \u201creserved\u201d meaning that only the UK government can legally use them. Any official dealings with countries outside of the UK are included in these reserved powers. So the Scottish government wouldn\u2019t be able to officially recognise Catalonia.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament also can\u2019t make any laws about reserved matters and Scottish government ministers can\u2019t act in those areas either.\n\nOn 27 October Catalonia declared independence from Spain, the Spanish government then put in place direct rule over the region, dismissed the Catalan government and its Parliament.\n\nIn response the Scottish government said \u201cWe understand and respect the position of the Catalan Government. While Spain has the right to oppose independence, the people of Catalonia must have the ability to determine their own future.\u201d She also said the EU had a responsibility to encourage dialogue to resolve the situation.\n\nThe UK government has said it will not recognise the Catalan declaration of independence and that it was based on an illegal vote.", "lang": "en"}
