Cancer survival rates in England are at a record high for adults aged 15 and over.\n\nAbout 60% of patients diagnosed with cancer in 1998 survived for at least one year, compared to 70% of patients diagnosed in 2013. 2013 is as far as this year\u2019s figures cover.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2009 the proportion of patients surviving five years or more went from 42% to almost 50%.\n\nThese figures are designed to show \u201creal progress in cancer outcomes\u201d over many years.\n\nThe estimates adjust for things like changes in the age and gender balance in the population over time, and whether certain types of cancer have become more or less common. This makes it easier to see if the likelihood of survival has changed over time.\n\nSurvival rates vary widely depending on the type of cancer. For example, adjusted for age, an estimated 96% of patients diagnosed with breast cancer between 2010 and 2014 survived for at least one year. In comparison, 34% of men and 40% of women diagnosed with lung cancer in the same period survived for at least one year.", "lang": "en"}
