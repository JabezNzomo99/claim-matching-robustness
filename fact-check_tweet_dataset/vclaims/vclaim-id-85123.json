However, the Clinton campaign declined to comment in response to our inquiries. So we examined whether there really is evidence to support her explanation that there was enough political momentum to amend the U.S. Constitution, and that \u201cthere had to be some way to stop that.\u201d What we found was a lot murkier than she made it seem. The evidence, if any, is pretty slim.\n\nDaschle responded: \u201cHillary\u2019s comments are completely accurate. There was a strong push to make marriage of a man a woman the only kind of marriage under the constitution. We had to give Members the chance to vote for something short of a constitutional provision.\u201d Daschle did not offer any more details. The other three senators did not respond, and their attorney who wrote the amicus brief also could not recall what the movement entailed \u2014 though the attorney noted that a \u201cmovement\u201d naturally refers to suggestions made in the political sphere, not necessarily a specific proposal made in Congress to amend the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cThinking back on it, those were private conversations that people did have, and I am more than willing to say again that that was something that came up in private discussions that I had. The important thing is, DOMA is gone. \u2026 Look what happened under the George W. Bush administration, when it was Karl Rove\u2019s strategy to put constitutional amendments on state ballots. \u2026 This was a real problem that people were concerned about. And if I\u2019m wrong about the public debate, I obviously take responsibility for that. But I think the important thing is that we are now beyond that, and my husband has certainly said, and I agree with what he said \u2026 [that] thankfully, we have moved to a stage where marriage equality is the law of the land.\u201d\n\nThis is a difficult claim to fact-check, because Clinton essentially explained what she believed her husband was thinking when he supported DOMA. Clearly, The Fact Checker has no insight into what was in his mind in 1996, nor are we privy to the private conversations he may have had then. We are limited to publicly available information and the recollections of those who were involved in the 1996 DOMA debate. And even then, we did not find clear evidence to support her explanation.", "lang": "en"}
