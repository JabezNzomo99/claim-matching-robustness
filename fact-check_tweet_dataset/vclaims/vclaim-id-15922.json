It claims \u201cresearch proves\u201d that drinking ice water can \u201ccause menstrual blood remaining in the uterine wall\u201d and lead to \u201cuterus cancer or tumour\u201d after five to 10 years. No reason is given for avoiding soda water and coconut.\n\u2022 None It tells women not to use shampoo during their periods \u201cbecause the pores of the head are open during menstruation and it can cause headache\u201d. This, it says, is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and the effects \u201ccan be felt when young and later when aged\u201d.\n\u2022 None Women mustn\u2019t eat cucumbers when they\u2019re menstruating, the post says, because \u201cthe sap present in the cucumber can block some menstruation (blood waste) in the uterine wall\u201d, which could cause barrenness.\n\u2022 None Finally, the advice goes, women\u2019s bodies \u201cshould not be knocked or hit by hard objects, especially the abdomen\u201d because it could cause them to vomit blood, and the uterus could be injured. This, it says, is the \u201corigin\u201d of cancer of the uterus, as well as of \u201ccysts and barrenness\u201d. \n\n\n\nhas been shared more than 35,000 times, attracting 500 comments and 7,500 reactions. A few\n\nhave also picked it up.\n\nThe source of the advice\n\nthe Indonesian Cancer Extension Institute. The post is illustrated with four disturbing images of surgery on a severely swollen belly.\n\nAfrica Check could find no organisation called \u201cthe Indonesian Cancer Extension Institute\u201d, in advanced searches on Google and other databases.\n\nreveals the four photos were originally published in a March 2017 article on the UK\u2019s\n\ntells of an unnamed 24-year-old woman from Mexico who had an ovarian cyst weighing 5 stone (32 kilograms) removed from her abdomen.\n\nNothing in the article linked the cyst to any of the symptoms or \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d in the Facebook post.\n\nAloysius Inofomoh, a consultant obstetrician based in Lagos, Nigeria, says all the post\u2019s claims are false.\n\n\u201cNone of these claims can be proven scientifically,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking ice water or cold drinks does not affect menstruation and ice water is not a risk factor for uterine cancer.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cCucumber is a vegetable that, when eaten, passes through the alimentary canal. It does not get to the uterus at all. There is no relationship between it and barrenness.\u201d\n\nHe said that if a woman is hit in the abdomen, depending on the strength and location of the impact, \u201cvomiting of blood means there is severe injury to the stomach or oesophagus - not the uterus\u201d.\n\nDr Kingsley Ekwuazi, a senior lecturer and consultant obstetrician at the\n\nat Nsukka rated every single claim in the Facebook post as false. \u2013", "lang": "en"}
