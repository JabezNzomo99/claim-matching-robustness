You shouldn\u2019t be here.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re taking a place of a man who could maybe get drafted and die in Vietnam.\u2019 It was just really personal! Personal and pointed.\u201d And to New York magazine this year, she recounted: \u201cI remember one young man said, \u2018If you get into law school and I don\u2019t, and I have to go to Vietnam and get killed, it\u2019s your fault.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUpdate: A reader directed us to a 1996 interview with the New Yorker in which Clinton told this story without a Vietnam reference. \u201cWe had to go in to Harvard to take the test, and we were in a huge room, and there were very few women there, and we sat at these desks waiting for the proctors or whoever to come and all the young men around us started to harass us,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThey started to say, \u2018What do you think you\u2019re doing? If you get into law school, you\u2019re going to take my position. You\u2019ve got no right to do this. Why don\u2019t you go home and get married?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe law was intended to deal with the perceived unfairness of wealthier, more educated men avoiding the draft through the \u201cstacking\u201d of educational deferments, such as going to college and then graduate school programs. On Feb. 16, 1968, the Johnson administration announced it would abolish graduate-school deferments for all but medical, dental and divinity students in the coming school year. University officials reacted in horror, and the president of Harvard University said the only people entering graduate school in September 1968 would be \u201cthe lame, the halt, the blind and the female,\u201d according to an account in Congressional Quarterly.\n\nIt certainly would have helped if Clinton had recalled this story many years earlier, especially since her 1996 version does not include a Vietnam reference. But at this point, there is really no way to get to bottom of this unless a witness comes forward. So we will have to label this Verdict Pending. We will update this if we obtain any additional information.\n\n\u201cI had hoped to go to Denver University Law School in the fall of 1970,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs you may have heard from others, women were a bare minority in law school at the time and really unwelcome. The angst about the draft was everywhere. His remark wasn\u2019t as clear as if I specifically got in I would take HIS place. The implication was women getting into law school meant some men who might otherwise have continued on deferment would no longer have that protection from being drafted. Simple math, women in the heretofore all male bastion meant some men would left out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took the LSAT late in 1969,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI actually had a member of my class say to me, in the library my first semester in law school: \u2018Don\u2019t you know you\u2019re taking the spot of a guy who might have to go to Vietnam but otherwise would need to support his family?\u2019\u201d So if it happened to me, it could very well have been said to Hillary; the tenor of the times in law school then was not yet feminist \u2014 students and some faculty were still getting used to the idea. While it was intentional on the part of law firms to hire women then, they were also still getting used to the idea.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
