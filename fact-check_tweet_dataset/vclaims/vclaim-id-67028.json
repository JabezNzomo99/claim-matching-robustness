The photo is a mugshot of a man arrested on Halloween in 2011.\n\nFacebook posts claiming that a Florida couple was arrested for selling hundreds of people fake \u201cgolden tickets to heaven\u201d have circulated online for years. This particular post includes alleged photos of the couple and identifies them as Tito and Amanda Watts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what the police say,\u201d Tito Watts supposedly said in a police statement. \u201cThe tickets are solid gold\u2026 And it was Jesus who gave them to me behind the KFC and said to sell them so I could get me some money to go to outer space. I met an alien named Stevie who said if I got the cash together he\u2019d take me and my wife on his flying saucer to his planet that\u2019s made entirely of drugs.\u201d\n\nThe post further alleges that Florida police \u201cconfiscated over $10,000 in cash, drug paraphernalia, and a baby alligator.\u201d\n\nCheck Your Fact didn\u2019t find any credible media reports about the Florida couple being arrested. The story appeared in a March 31, 2015 article posted on the website Stuppid.com. The website has previously published fictional articles, including one claiming former President Barack Obama\u2019s image would in 2017 replace that of George Washington on the one dollar bill.\n\n\u201cStuppid.com reports stupid news we find around the web and from other sources,\u201d the website\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page states. \u201cWe aim to publish the stupidest, craziest stuff we can find.\u201d\n\nThe Stuppid.com article claims Tito and Amanda Watts were arrested in Jacksonville, Florida. However, a spokesperson for Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office told Check Your Fact that the individuals do not appear in its inmate search system. The sheriff\u2019s office also told PolitiFact in 2018 that it found no record of such a case.\n\nThe Jacksonville Sun-Times reported on the story in 2015 as fact but later updated its article to note: \u201cThis story turned out to be an April Fool\u2019s joke, and unfortunately we fell for it.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Mummified Fairy Remains Found In The English Countryside?)\n\nThe supposed photo of Tito Watts can be found on Shutterstock Editorial, where the caption describes it as an \u201cunnamed police mugshot of a person arrested in Halloween make-up 2 Nov 2011.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
