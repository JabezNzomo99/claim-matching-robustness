I said, \u2018Do me a favor, speed it up, speed it up.\u2019 And they will \u2014 they\u2019re working really hard and quick.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has adopted a new refrain: A vaccine for the novel coronavirus will be completed in record time. On several occasions, the president has bragged about the speed with which experts and pharmaceutical companies are working on a vaccine.\n\nTrump is not wrong in saying that scientists are rapidly developing a vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus. However, he seems to be overstating when a vaccine will be available to the public.\n\nHealth experts say they have completed vaccine options ready for testing at a historically fast rate. However, a vaccine available for public use is different than a vaccine ready for the first phase of testing. Experts have emphasized that actual deployment of the vaccine is more than a year away, not a few months, as Trump has suggested.\n\nAnthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a White House news conference on Feb. 26: \u201cSo although this is the fastest we have ever gone from a sequence of a virus to a trial, it still would not be applicable to the epidemic unless we really wait about a year to a year and a half.\u201d\n\nFauci said vaccine candidates will \u201clikely go into clinical trials in a phase one study within about two months or maybe even six weeks. That would be a record. However, that is not a vaccine, because it will take about three months or more to show that it is safe. And then, if you show that it\u2019s safe, you\u2019ve got to put it into what\u2019s called a phase two trial to show that it works. And the reason is \u2014 there\u2019s medical, ethical and other considerations \u2014 is that we\u2019d be giving this to normal people to prevent infection. So you must be sure, the edict of medicine: First, do no harm. We need to make sure that it\u2019s safe and we need to make sure it works. That entire process will take at least a year and a year and a half. So when we hear talk about a vaccine\u2019s going to be ready in a couple of months, it won\u2019t be ready for being deployed. It\u2019s going to take a while. So, we\u2019re going to have a multi-step process.\u201d\n\n\u201cClinical testing of vaccines for both safety and to see whether they work is not a quick process,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cI doubt very much that we\u2019ll have a vaccine in time for this epidemic, maybe if this virus returns on an annual basis. We\u2019ll have a vaccine downstream. But unfortunately, I think for now, we have to look at the realistic prospect that we\u2019re going to have to battle this virus without the benefit of a vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cVaccines have to be tested because there\u2019s precedent for vaccines to actually make disease worse. You don\u2019t want to rush and treat a million people and find out you\u2019re making 900,000 of them worse,\u201d said Leonard Schleifer, founder and chief executive of Regeneron.\n\nTrump appears to be expediting the vaccine development process, misrepresenting how fast a vaccine will be available to the public in fighting the novel coronavirus. Fauci has repeatedly corrected the president\u2019s comments on the vaccine to put forward a more accurate timeline.", "lang": "en"}
