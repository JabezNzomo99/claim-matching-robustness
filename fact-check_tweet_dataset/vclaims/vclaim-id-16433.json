The report has been filed from Wuhan.\n\nThe alleged clipping was also shared by several social media users last year.\n\nThe headline of the report has been photoshopped and this is evident by observing the alphabets carefully \u2013 \u2018t\u2019 and \u2018e\u2019 in the word \u2018mate\u2019 are different from \u2018t\u2019 and \u2018e\u2019 in the word \u2018times\u2019. \u2018t\u2019 is longer and \u2018e\u2019 is bigger in the word \u2018mate\u2019.\n\nAlso, there is a visible change in texture around the word \u2018mate\u2019 when zoomed.\n\nTimes of India had also put out a tweet clarifying that the image is photoshopped and that the headline of the article actually reads, \u2018Modi, Xi will meet 6 times in 24 hours\u2019.\n\nThis was also corroborated by some Twitter users who posted photographs of the article taken from the newspaper. After being informed that they\u2019ve fallen for a photo-shopped image, many acknowledged their error of judgement.\n\nThe two leaders are scheduled to have a series of meetings on important global, regional and bilateral issues during the informal two-day summit at Wuhan.", "lang": "en"}
