Perhaps the most preposterous of these claims was that Thunberg was actually an Australian actress named Estella Renee who was delivering speeches on environmental issues not because she was concerned about the planet, but because she was a deep state crisis actor and paid to shill.\n\nWhile researching this article we found at least three variations of the \u201cGreta Thunberg is an actress\u201d claim. They are as follows:\n\u2022 Greta Thunberg has an IMDB page and this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous.\n\u2022 Actress Estelle Renee is a crisis actor who portrayed a crying teenager (not Greta Thunberg) during a climate protest.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a deeper look at each of these items individually.\n\nSeveral social media users have claimed that Thunberg is actually an Australian actress named Estelle Renee. Facebook user Jack A. Schulman, for instance, wrote:\n\nAspiring Actress impersonates crying child climate activist at UN, impersonator is a sham. Screams \u201cHow dare you!\u201d from acting class. Estella Renee is a very talented shakespearian actress from Australia. She can do Scandinavian accents. She can break down and cry. She can scream \u201cHow dare you!\u201d. She deserves an Academy Award not a Nobel for impersonating Heidi looking Greta Thunberg, a fictional Character before the UN yesterday, a fake climate activist, a child actor age 15 and 1/2 screaming \u201cHow dare you!\u201d straight out of \u201d Streetcar named Desire! \u201c. Otherwise, she\u2019s a sham and a fraud! Her publicist refused to respond to our calls, but NY customs identified her as Estrella Renee, here \u201cto see the sights\u201d at her entry from Australia. Her adult accompaniment signed her into her hotel room as Greta Thungren, but we confirmed she is Estelle Renee. We turned over her illegal false identity to DHS who has confirmed her dual identity, but is still investigating. They are not sure impersonation is a crime.\n\nThunberg didn\u2019t appear out of thin air in September 2019 to deliver a speech to the United Nations. She\u2019s been on the public radar since at least September 2018 when she started staging climate protests in Sweden. Thunberg has also been nominated for numerous awards (including the Nobel Peace Prize), has met with several world leaders, and took a highly publicized voyage across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nFurthermore, we know the identity of Thunberg\u2019s parents, Svante Thunberg and Malena Ernman, as well as her grandfather, Olof Thunberg, and her sister, Beata.\n\nIn other words, Greta Thunberg is not a \u201cfictional character.\u201d Her journey to becoming a global environmental activist has been well documented.\n\nGreta Thunberg has an IMDB page. Is this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous?\n\nA slightly less far-fetched version of this claim holds that Thunberg is listed as an \u201cactress\u201d on her IMDB page. While this is true, many have shared this screenshot as if it was somehow damaging to Thunberg\u2019s reputation as an environmental activist:\n\nThunberg has one acting credit to her name. She lent her voice to a short film titled \u201cAve Para\u00edso\u201d that was released in Spain in 2019. The remainder of her IMDB page simply lists appearances she\u2019s made on television programs (such as \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d) or in environmental documentaries where she is credited as herself.\n\nThe fact that Thunberg has an IMDB page is often shared along with the insinuation that her environmental beliefs are not sincere. However, it should be noted that being an actor does not automatically disqualify someone from having an opinion, being an activist, or having a political career. Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio, for instance, often lends his voice to environmental causes. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronald Reagan were both actors before embarking on political careers. Even U.S. President Donald Trump is listed as an \u201cactor\u201d on his IMDB page:\n\nThe website Michael Smith News noted one additional detail about Thunberg\u2019s IMDB page that seemingly hinted at the notion that she was a paid actress looking for new gigs. The website wrote that \u201cyou can talk to her agent if you\u2019d like to book her for acting work\u201d and then linked to an IMDB Pro link. However, it doesn\u2019t appear that Michael Smith News has access to IMDB Pro. When we checked Greta\u2019s listing on IMDB Pro, we found no listing for Thunberg\u2019s alleged agent.\n\nDoes the viral video of a young climate protester crying feature actress Estelle Renee?\n\nThunberg wasn\u2019t the only environmental activist to be accused of being an actor. The websites TeaParty.org, The Gateway Pundit, Joe for America, and the aforementioned Michael Smith News all published articles about how it was \u201call a hoax\u201d and that the \u201clittle girl seen crying in viral video\u201d at the Global Warming rally was really a child actress, \u201ca prop for the left,\u201d named Estelle Renee:\n\nThese articles are referring to a viral video from May 2019 of a young protester who broke down in tears while talking to reporters about climate change. The video in question can be seen in the second of the following tweets:\n\nThe young protester in this video, whose real name is Estella Brasier, does have a profile on the talent website Star Now. However, these websites provided no evidence that this person was paid to appear at this protest or to \u201cact\u201d that they were concerned about the environment. And as we noted above, the fact that a person has acted or is an actor does not disqualify them from having personal beliefs.\n\nBrasier\u2019s father spoke to Maarten Schenk of the debunking website LeadStories about this rumor:\n\nThe events of that day are in the public domain and were on every TV station. The ideas and concerns expressed by Estella depicted in that video are entirely genuine, not paid for, she was not acting\u2026 \u2026Estella was not expecting to be interviewed by the media that day: it could have been her, it could have been anyone else. She was just standing closest to the cameras. It is possible to be both worried about climate-change and a child actress at the same time.", "lang": "en"}
