{"title": "HS2: is it faster?", "subtitle": "We looked at whether HS2 will be faster for travellers than current trains.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-16373", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/hs2-it-faster/", "vclaim": "\u201cGuess what, it won't stop here, you can't get on the train here, we have to go to Leeds so it will take longer to get to London from Wakefield than it does today.\u201d\n\nThe government has produced an analysis of the estimated time it will take to get from \u201cmajor economic centres\u201d to either London Euston station or Birmingham Curzon Street when the planned HS2 rail network is built. The analysis says these estimates are based on the \u201cfastest typical times\u201d now and the fastest possible journey on HS2.\n\nAccording to these figures, journey times to London Euston will reduce by up to 81 minutes (from Manchester Airport) or by just 13 minutes (from Derby).\n\nTo Birmingham Curzon Street the greatest reduction in journey time will be from Leeds, down 69 minutes, and the smallest reduction in time will be from Sheffield Midland, down just 15 minutes from current journey times.\n\nThere will be the same reduction in time between Leeds and Sheffield Midland (15 minutes) while journey times between Leeds and Birmingham Interchange will drop by 102 minutes.\n\nOf course these are just estimates of the fastest possible times. Actual journeys might take longer. And not all of the cities included in the analysis will be directly on the HS2 line. The timings take into account the overall impact of HS2 on the rail network.\n\nBut what about journeys from Wakefield to London?\n\nCurrently it takes around two hours to get a train directly from Wakefield to Kings Cross station in London.\n\nAssuming that a journey to London using HS2 also goes from Wakefield via Leeds the journey could be a bit faster, but that\u2019s comparing current train times to the fastest possible times projected by the government.\n\nAccording the government's most recent figures, when the second phase of HS2 is completed in 2033 the journey time from Leeds to London Euston station will have decreased from 131 minutes to 81 minutes, including a five-minute interchange at a new East Midlands hub.\n\nTravelling from Wakefield to Leeds by train currently takes as little as 13 minutes (though it can take over 35 minutes), according to National Rail. This would suggest that a train journey from Wakefield to London using HS2 would take at least 94 minutes, although this doesn\u2019t account for time taken to change trains in Leeds or changes in existing train times by 2033.", "lang": "en"}
