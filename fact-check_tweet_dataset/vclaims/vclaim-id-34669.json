(RELATED: Does This Photo Show \u2018Women Of The Democrat Party\u2019 In KKK Robes?)\n\nShe did once speak before a women\u2019s chapter of the KKK, saying in her autobiography that \u201cany aroused group was a good group.\u201d However, this image does not capture that visit \u2013 the picture has been doctored.\n\nThe original photo, tracked down by Snopes in 2015, shows KKK members saluting a cross, not Sanger. The superimposed image of Sanger is from 1931, taken before she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn Sanger\u2019s autobiography, she describes the speaking engagement with the women\u2019s chapter in detail, calling it \u201cone of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever before had I looked into a sea of faces like these,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was sure that if I uttered one word, such as abortion, outside the usual vocabulary of these women they would go off into hysteria. And so my address that night had to be in the most elementary terms, as though I were trying to make children understand.\u201d\n\nThe image shared on Facebook claims that Sanger \u201cdescribed her experience with elation\u201d and then quotes from the autobiography, yet the tone of her account was not particularly flattering.\n\nThe meme does accurately quote one excerpt from the book: \u201cIn the end, through simple illustrations I believed I had accomplished my purpose. A dozen invitations to speak to similar groups were proffered.\u201d (It excludes the phrase \u201cthrough simple illustrations,\u201d however.)\n\nThe doctored image appears to have originated with an art contest. Hosted online by an anti-Sanger website, participants were asked to recreate the lecture she gave before the KKK chapter in \u201cunique artistic ways.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
