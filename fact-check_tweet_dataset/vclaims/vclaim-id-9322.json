It\u2019s either a slush fund to fill the Clintons\u2019 coffers, or a vehicle for powerful individuals or foreign governments to pay for access to the State Department.\n\nMeanwhile, Hillary Clinton and her presidential campaign have defended the foundation as well as her conduct as secretary of state, arguing there was a clear and unprecedented separation between the charity and State.\n\nPolitiFact has fact-checked elements of both sides of the story. We\u2019re here to help you sort out the truth. It\u2019s not as clear cut as Clinton\u2019s attackers describe, and there\u2019s nuance missing from the Clintons\u2019 defense.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s acceptance of millions in foreign donations, including from countries with business in front of the State Department while Hillary Clinton was at the helm, is a chief source of concern driving the perception problem.\n\n\"The perception issues bother me more than anything,\" said Tony Proscio, a researcher at Duke University\u2019s Center for Strategic Philanthropy and Civil Society. \"Not because there\u2019s anything inherently corrupt, but because it\u2019s asking for political trouble.\"\n\nIn a pre-emptive measure against potential conflicts of interest, the foundation signed a memorandum of understanding with President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in December 2008. The foundation promised to report its donors in order to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. Hillary Clinton also signed a separate ethics agreement with the State Department, pledging to keep her distance from foundation matters as secretary of state.\n\nEmails from Clinton\u2019s State Department, detailed in media reports, show how fuzzy the line was between the department and the foundation. Clinton took many meetings with foundation donors and offered assistance to several. And at times, foundation staff reached out to Clinton\u2019s staff to inquire about opportunities for donors.\n\nThe ethics pledges may not have specifically prohibited emails like these, but they did break the firewall between official government business and Clinton\u2019s personal connections that Clinton agreed to preserve. So when Clinton surrogate and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm said Clinton \"abided by the ethics agreement\" between the foundation and the Obama administration, PolitiFact rated that claim Mostly False.\n\nRegarding these ethics agreements, Clinton herself has also said the Clinton Foundation \"took steps that went above and beyond all legal requirements and, indeed, all standard requirements followed by every other charitable organization.\"\n\nClinton is right that the foundation bearing her family name has done more than what is required of charities by law by disclosing donors and rolling back foreign donations.\n\nBut the requirements are rather basic to begin with. Other nonprofits, including those tied to a few other presidential candidates and presidents, have been similarly forthcoming. So the Clinton Foundation\u2019s transparency is not all that remarkable.\n\n\"The legal requirements are so absolutely minimal that it\u2019s like saying, \u2018No, I haven\u2019t shot anyone today, so you should be grateful,\u2019 \" said Daniel Schuman, policy director for Demand Progress, a progressive advocacy group focused on civil liberties and government transparency.\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 surge in wealth since they left the White House in 2001 \u2014 largely from hefty speaking fees and book advances \u2014 and their highly visible involvement in their foundation can leave the impression that they\u2019re profiting from the organization, rather than actually engaging in charity work. This is not the case, but some Republican opponents have made it sound like it is.\n\n\"The fact is, if they\u2019ve got about 80 percent overhead and 20 percent of the money's actually getting into the place that it should, then it seems like the only work that the Clinton Foundation is doing is lining the pockets of Bill and Hillary Clinton,\" said GOP Chair Reince Priebus.\n\nPolitiFact rated Priebus\u2019 claim False. It is based on a misunderstanding of how the Clinton Foundation works. In reality, about 80 to 90 percent of the organization\u2019s expenditures go toward charitable programs.\n\nThis confusion stems primarily from the fact that \"foundation\" is in the name. Typically, a private foundation\u2019s primary activity is grantmaking, giving money to charities who actually do the work. The Clinton Foundation operates as a public charity, conducting its own charitable programs.\n\nIts in-house and affiliated programs include expanding access to low-cost AIDS medication, supporting agriculture in Malawi, providing disaster relief in Haiti, forging partnerships to combat climate change, creating business mentoring programs, drafting school food guidelines, assessing the progress of women\u2019s rights globally, and more.\n\nContrary to Priebus\u2019 assertion, Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton receive no compensation from their work on the foundation\u2019s board of directors, according to tax documents.\n\nHowever, you can make a case that they have received some indirect personal benefits. It\u2019s possible the foundation has boosted the Clintons\u2019 public image since Bill Clinton left office, and this has helped them command such large speaking fees and book advances, and it\u2019s also given them extra opportunities to mingle with the global elite. But they may have had these things absent the Clinton Foundation, as their celebrity primarily comes from their track record in politics.\n\nDefending the Clintons and their foundation, Democratic pundit Hilary Rosen said \"they take no salary, they get no money from it, they take no personal benefit from it.\" We rated her claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
