Several messages on Twitter and WhatsApp claimed that the former firebrand EC who redefined the role of the election commission in the nineties has passed away in Chennai.\n\nThe news of his death also went viral on WhatsApp\n\nBut several users on Twitter including former CEC Dr S Y Quraishi disputed the news and said that it was not Seshan, but his wife Jayalakshmi Seshan who passed away on March 31.\n\nBOOM called up the Chennai residence number of TN Seshan and a relative confirmed that the news was a hoax and that he was fine.\n\nT N Seshan who served as the Chief Election Commissioner between 1990 to 1996 is widely credited for taking crucial steps to clean up the election process forcing political parties to toe the line. During his term, he cracked down on election malpractices, forced the issuance of voting ID cards, setting limits for poll expenditure and disqualifying candidates irrespective of their stature, if they didn't meet the EC regulations.\n\nDuring his period of service, the EC found its footing as an impartial election regulator focused only in the interest of the country's voters and the preservation of democracy through free and fair election process. He won the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award for government service in 1996.", "lang": "en"}
