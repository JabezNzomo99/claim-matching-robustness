For example, the popular (but frequently debunked) Twitter feed History Lovers Club has posted the graphic at least five times since March 2017, most recently on Sept. 11, 2019:\n\nThe image is not a historical document but a piece of art created by an artist who goes by the online handle \u201cOnorobo.\u201d Posting the image to Tumblr on Oct. 11, 2011, Onorobo described it as \u201can info-graphic I drew for class.\u201d That being said, the picture does, for the most part, accurately reflect 19th-century surgical practices. Here is an infographic titled \u201cMethods of amputation at the upper and lower arm\u201d created by the French medical illustrator Nicolas Henri Jacob in the 1830s, courtesy of the Wellcome Trust digital collections:\n\nDark humor about the process that centered around the need for alcohol would also not have been out of the question. Here, also from the Wellcome Trust, is a 1902 cartoon titled (from French) \u201cWe can rest a little,\u201d showing a surgeon having some chilled champagne mid-way through a painful amputation:\n\nAs the graphic at issue was made in 2011, however, claims that it is a historical document are false.", "lang": "en"}
