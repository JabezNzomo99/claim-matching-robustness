That was conservative talk show host Sean Hannity\u2019s point as he talked with a caller on his radio program on April 8, 2015.\n\n\"You can\u2019t build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia, did you know that?\" Hannity said.\n\nA reader didn\u2019t know that, and asked us to look into Hannity\u2019s claim. It checks out.\n\nIbrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told us that while many Muslim countries allow churches, and synagogues for that matter, Saudi Arabia is unique.\n\n\"I believe Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim country in which churches are prohibited,\" Hooper said.\n\nAkbar S. Ahmed is the chair of Islamic Studies at American University. He told that there is nothing formalized in Islamic law that forbids the building of churches or synagogues.\n\nSaudi Arabia has a tradition of adopting the most restrictive interpretations of Islam. It is perhaps best known for its opposition to women driving cars.\n\nIn 2008, representatives of the Vatican and Saudi Arabia held to clear the way for building a church in the Saudi kingdom. But the talks stalled.\n\nChristian bishops in Germany, Austria and Russia rebuked Saudi Arabia's top religious official in 2012 after reports that he issued a fatwa saying all churches on the Arabian Peninsula should be destroyed. According to , Saudi Arabia bans all non-Muslim houses of prayer. Christians there, typically foreign workers, pray in private homes.\n\nHannity said that Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t allow Christian churches.\n\nThat\u2019s correct. The Saudi Arabian government\u2019s policy bans the construction of churches. Saudi Arabia is an outlier among predominantly Muslim countries.", "lang": "en"}
