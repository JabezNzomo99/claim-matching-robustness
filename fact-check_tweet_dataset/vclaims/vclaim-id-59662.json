The video shows a huge all-white temple.\n\nSimilar posts can be seen here and here.\n\nALSO READ: These pictures of saffron painted buildings are not from\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found that the video does not depict the Ram Mandir and is hence false.\n\nOur first red flag in the video is the image of the deity being worshipped. The video features the idol of Lord Mahavir, who is worshipped in Jainism.\n\nWe ran some keyframes of the video through Google Reverse Image Search and came across the same video on YouTube. It was posted by Kems Studio in June 2014 and had 16.7K views.\n\nAt the beginning of the video, the name of the deity is mentioned as Shree Parshwnath Navagrah 72 Jinalay Tirth.\n\nWhen we searched the name on Google, we found out that it belongs to the 72 Jinalaya Jain Temple located in Gujarat.\n\nWhen we saw the 360-degree view on Google of the same, the images were identical to the ones shown in the animated video.\n\nHence, it is clear that the animated video is six-years-old and does not show a layout of the Ram mandir that is to come up in Ayodhya.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
