But Congress, under Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code, did exempt the president and vice president from conflict-of-interest laws on the theory that the presidency has so much power that any possible executive action might pose a potential conflict.\n\n\u201cAs a general rule, public officials in the executive branch are subject to criminal penalties if they personally and substantially participate in matters in which they (or their immediate families, business partners or associated organizations) hold financial interests,\u201d the Congressional Research Service said in an October report. \u201cHowever, because of concerns regarding interference with the exercise of constitutional duties, Congress has not applied these restrictions to the President. Consequently, there is no current legal requirement that would compel the President to relinquish financial interests because of a conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nThis principle was outlined in a 1974 letter from the Justice Department, issued at a time when Nelson Rockefeller was under consideration to be confirmed as vice president after Richard Nixon resigned and Gerald Ford became president. Rockefeller, then governor of New York, was heir to a fortune and consented to congressional hearings in which his business interests were closely examined.\n\n\u201cThe uniqueness of the President\u2019s situation is also illustrated by the fact that disqualification of the President from policy decisions because of personal conflicting interests is inconceivable,\u201d the letter noted. The 1978 Ethics of Government Act and the 1989 Ethics Reform Act later codified this principle.\n\nIn other words, Congress assumed that the president could be trusted to do the right thing. Most recent presidents \u2014 Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton \u2014 have placed their personal assets in a blind trust, even if they did not have a legal obligation to do so. President Obama did not, but his assets were only in mutual funds and Treasury bonds.\n\nTrump is unique because so much of wealth is tied in with the value of his \u201cTrump\u201d brand. Already, foreign diplomats have been flocking to his recently opened hotel in downtown Washington \u2014 and Trump noted to the Times that his brand is suddenly \u201chotter.\u201d\n\nThe fear of potential influence from foreign governments through economic benefits to federal officials led to the Foreign Emoluments Clause in the U.S. Constitution. Trump\u2019s business holdings around the world could test the boundaries of the letter or spirit of the clause. Case Western Reserve University law professor Erik Jensen outlined key questions that may arise regarding whether the Emoluments Clause would apply to Trump and his business holdings.\n\n\u201cIf nothing else, however, the Clause emphasizes the founders\u2019 fears about economic benefits coming to American officials from foreign governments. It adds a constitutional dimension to some good, old-fashioned appearance-of-impropriety concerns,\u201d Jensen said in response to a question about Trump and the Emoluments Clause posed by Jonathan Adler of the Volokh Conspiracy blog.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Trump\u2019s pick for chief of staff, Reince Priebus, has vowed that the White House counsel will review all potential areas that could pose a conflict: \u201cI can assure the American people that there wouldn\u2019t be any wrongdoing or any sort of undue influence over any decision-making.\u201d\n\nWhile spoken in classic \u201cTrumpese\u201d that fails to capture the nuances of the law, the president-elect did rightly point to an exemption for the president and vice president in conflicts of interest laws. And while such an exemption exists, the theory was that the presidency has so much power that any policy decision could pose a potential conflict. The law assumed that the president could be trusted to do the right thing and take actions to avoid appearance or presence of impropriety \u2014 not that the law is \u201ctotally\u201d on the president\u2019s \u201cside\u201d or that it would allow the president to use the exemption to his favor.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement does not quite rise to the level of a Geppetto Checkmark, nor does it qualify for a Pinocchio. So we will not rate this claim. Trump, nevertheless, should be more careful about his wording on this point. It\u2019s quite possible he will face a number of conflicts of interest during his presidency. The law may offer an exemption for the president, but political reality \u2014 and perception\u2014 often does not.", "lang": "en"}
