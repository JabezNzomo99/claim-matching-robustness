This is false; the USPS had a net loss of $8.8 billion in 2019, and its total liabilities exceed $97 billion, according to official disclosures.\n\n\u201cThe USPS is not in debt. The USPS is not losing money.\u201d These two statements, along with other assertions about the agency, were shared in various posts entitled \u201cFacts You Should Know\u201d or \u201cUSPS Fun Facts.\u201d This post was shared 147,000 times since 2013, while these two from 2018 have more than 100,000 shares combined.\n\nThe memes resurfaced in April 2020 as a bill in the House of Representatives proposed to forgive the agency\u2019s debt as part of a stimulus package aimed at mitigating the economic fallout associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThey gained traction again in August 2020 when Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump campaign megadonor, was called to testify before Congress over concerns he was working to undermine mail delivery.\n\nHowever the posts misrepresented the financial health of the USPS in 2013, 2018, and 2020.\n\nThe Postal Service\u2019s 2019 annual financial report shows that the agency had a net loss of $8.8 billion that fiscal year, bringing total liabilities to more than $97 billion.\n\nScreenshot of the USPS annual financial statement for 2019 \u201cThe prefunding requirement in the 2006 law is a major reason for our financial situation,\u201d USPS spokesman David Partenheimer told AFP by email in reference to a bill that forces the institution to set aside money for its employees\u2019 pensions before they are due. Partenheimer also blamed \u201can outdated business model that needs to be addressed through legislative and regulatory reform.\u201d \u201cBut with COVID-19 our financial situation has gotten even worse,\u201d he added, pointing out that USPS\u2019s most profitable revenue stream, First-Class Mail, is hurt by businesses\u2019 grinding to a halt because of the pandemic. The novel coronavirus will increase the agency\u2019s debt by $22 billion over the next 18 months, Postmaster General Megan Brennan said in an April 10 statement.\n\n\u201cThe USPS costs taxpayers exactly $0. The USPS has always been self-sustaining,\u201d the posts claim. The Postal Service is currently self-supporting, due to its special status as an independent federal agency overseen but not funded by Congress.\n\nHowever, the mail service was funded by tax dollars until the 1970s, when the Postal Reorganization Act was passed under President Richard Nixon, turning the Post Office Department into USPS, an independent agency run more like a corporation.\n\nAccording to Partenheimer, USPS currently employs 97,000 military veterans, making it \u201cone of the largest employers of veterans in the country.\u201d\n\nThe US mail employs 630,000 people overall.\n\nIt is true that the Postal Service is constitutionally guaranteed. As the ninth state ratified the Constitution in 1788, Congress was granted the power \u201cto establish Post Offices and post Roads.\u201d\n\nThe bailout signed on March 25 did not include debt forgiveness but instead provided a $10 billion loan for the Postal Service. The funds are currently awaiting approval from the US Treasury Department.\n\nFollowing the Postmaster General\u2019s April 10 statement on USPS\u2019s dwindling finances, social media users have urged their peers to save the institution by buying sheets of stamps.", "lang": "en"}
