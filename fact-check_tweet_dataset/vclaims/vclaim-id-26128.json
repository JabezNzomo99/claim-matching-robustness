Multiple outlets, including top TV channels reported that Crimea residents were \u201coutraged\u201d by Laima Vaikule\u2019s refusal to include Crimea in her concert tour.\n\nVaikule, a native of Latvia \u2013 the Baltic state, member of the European Union \u2013 was a mega star in the former USSR and she remains very popular both in Russia and in ex-Soviet countries.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference before her concert in the Ukrainian Black Sea city of Odessa on Saturday, August 11, Vaikule said about visiting Crimea, \u201cNo. We, Europeans, are prohibited. I wouldn\u2019t go there no matter what honorarium I was offered.\u201d She then added that she had no nostalgia for USSR. To the contrary \u2013 she was happy the USSR has collapsed.\n\nIn Russia lawmakers, politicians, artists, writers condemned Vaikule and expressed outrage over her position towards Russia\u2019s claim that Crimea was lawfully annexed.\n\nGrigory Joffe, the head of the Crimea Public Chamber \u2013 a pro-Moscow institution created after Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014 \u2013 said Laima Vaikule will be added to the \u201cCrimean dossier\u201d as soon as the Chamber\u2019s monitoring group makes the decision.\n\nThe so-called \u201cCrimean dossier\u201d is a list of the names of the public figures who do not accept the Russian annexation. The \u201cdossier\u201d labels them as persons \u201cwhose public statements and actions are directed at igniting inter-ethnic hatred, violate the rights and freedoms of the Crimeans, and consist of terrorist threat.\u201d Announced first on July 18, the list has about 30 names, including some of Russia\u2019s most prominent cultural figures.\n\nIn his comments, Joffe twisted Vaikule\u2019s words accusing her of not visiting Crimea due to greed. Vaikule is looking at the \u201cCrimean situation through the open or closed wallet,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe quality of the artist\u2019s soul cannot be measured in silver coins.\u201d\n\nJoffe\u2019s interpretation of Vaicule\u2019s comments are the exact opposite of what she said. Vaicule specifically pointed out that she would not go to Crimea even if she was offered big money to go.\n\nIn his response, Joffe never mentions the real reason behind Vaikule\u2019s decision not to include Crimea in her tour \u2013 which is her compliance with the EU sanctions.\n\nAs a citizen of Latvia, an EU member state, Vaikule is prohibited from doing business in Russian-occupied Crimea under the European Commission regulations for business operations in Crimea and the European Council Regulation #692/2014.\n\nMoscow denies accusations that it has annexed and is occupying Crimea, insisting peninsula residents made a free choice to join Russia via a referendum that the UN and most of the world said was not only faked but also posed a \u201cmajor threat to stability.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info recently fact checked a glowing review by an author in state-run Ria-Novosti of the well-equipped modernized Russian military that moved into Crimea in 2014. In so doing, he contradicted Russia\u2019s narratives on the invasion of Crimea by \u201clittle green men\u201d whose uniforms lacked insignia.", "lang": "en"}
