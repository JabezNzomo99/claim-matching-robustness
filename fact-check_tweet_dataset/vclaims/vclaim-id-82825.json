We took a look at these two elements, the context of the ad and the actual sources of the quotes and footage the ad used.\n\nThe house was located near the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. The agency wanted to turn the house and two other properties over to the Trump Organization. Trump had planned to landscape the area and build a new parking lot, with a waiting area for limousines.\n\nIn 1998, the New Jersey Superior Court ruled in Coking\u2019s favor, saying there was no valid public purpose for the government to seize her property. The agency was attempting to do so for private gain (Trump and his business), the court found.\n\nThis newer version of the ad still carries the bulldozing claim. There are news article quotes flashing by while the narrator says: \u201cTrump schemed with Atlantic City government to force Coking from her home using eminent domain.\u201d Two quotes \u2014 \u201cTrump Convinced the State Agency\u201d and \u201cTo Bulldoze a Widow\u2019s Home\u201d \u2014 are attributed to the Institute for Justice (co-counsel for Coking in the case), cited in a July 21, 2015, Newsweek article.\n\nTrump: \u201cIf somebody has a property in the middle of a 7,000 job factory, as an example, that\u2019s going to move into the town \u2014 but they need this one corner of this property, and it\u2019s going to provide 7,000 jobs in a community that\u2019s dying, of which we have many in this country, okay? I am for that.\u201d\n\nThe clip actually comes from a seven-minute explanation of eminent domain and the Coking case during a Jan. 23, 2016, rally in Pella, Iowa. Trump responded to Cruz\u2019s attack ad, explained that he offered Coking money to give up her home, but that he didn\u2019t succeed. (The relevant portion begins at the 14-minute mark.)\n\nIn the speech, Trump says he supports eminent domain being used judiciously, for public projects. Interestingly, he doesn\u2019t offer up an explanation of whether the use of eminent domain in the Coking case would have been for a private or public gain.\n\nThe full quote where the ad\u2019s footage comes from went like this (removed section in boldface). You will see that the snippet used in the ad is actually Trump trying to summarize the message on the Keystone XL pipeline website:\n\n\u201cWhen you think about eminent domain, so if you go to the login, if you go to Keystone Pipeline [website] and the sales pitch, you\u2019ll see a whole section on eminent domain: \u2018Yes, we have to use the power of eminent domain.\u2019 Because you\u2019ve got to go through hundreds of private properties to get the pipeline. The only way you can do it is through eminent domain. I don\u2019t love eminent domain, but you need it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a juicy story: Trump convinced the government to bulldoze a woman\u2019s home and force her out of it. Trump certainly tried, but he didn\u2019t succeed. Moreover, the Cruz campaign continues to mislead the public by not making it clear that the state Superior Court ruled in the woman\u2019s favor, and it takes Trump\u2019s comments out of context.\n\nThis ad is a classic example of cherry-picking video footage and quotes from news articles to craft an attack message. Other candidates, most recently evidenced by Jeb Bush, have figured out how to use the facts to attack Trump over this case and his support for eminent domain \u2014 but Cruz still appears to insist on twisting the facts to achieve the same.", "lang": "en"}
