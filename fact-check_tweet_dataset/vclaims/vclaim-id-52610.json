Netizens have accused the iconic residence and office of the United States President of profiting through these coins sold via the \u201cWhite House gift shop\u201d.\n\nSharing pictures of the commemorative coins on Facebook and Twitter, social media users claim, \u201cWOULD you believe, the White House gift shop is selling a commemorative Covid-19 coin for 100 dollars? Typical 45, anything for a buck even if it cost 60,000+ lives\u201d.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The White House has not released any commemorative coronavirus coin. A private company called \u201cWhite House Gift Shop\u201d is selling the coins and these are not sanctioned by the office of the US President.Several Facebook users have shared similar posts accusing the White House.\n\nMost users, to support their claim, have shared articles by \u201cTMZ\u201d, \u201cLGBTQ Nation\u201d and \u201cAJC\u201d, which have referred to the website \u201cwhitehousegiftshop.com\u201d.\n\nThese articles have clearly mentioned that the \u201cWhite House Gift Shop\u201d is a private company. But people on social media have misunderstood and concluded that the US government is selling commemorative coronavirus coins.\n\nInternational fact-check organisation \u201cSnopes\u201d had reached out to Anthony Giannini, the owner of \u201cWhite House Gift Shop\u201d, who confirmed that the \u201cWhite House is not selling coronavirus coins\u201d and the company \u201cis not affiliated with The White House, nor is The White House involved in any of our decisions, products, or operations\u201d.\n\nAlthough the website had an early connection with the White House during the Truman administration, but now it is not affiliated with the US President or the government or the White House.\n\nOfficial commemorative coins are produced by the United States Mint. As per its official website, there is no such plan by the US government to release any commemorative coin for coronavirus victims.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the White House Gift Shop, which is selling commemorative coronavirus coins, is a private company and has no relation with the White House or the US government.", "lang": "en"}
