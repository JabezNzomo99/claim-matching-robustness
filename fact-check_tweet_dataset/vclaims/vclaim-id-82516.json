BOOM was able to verify that a similar image of the plaque was shot by a BBC Gujarati journalist.\n\nTwo photos that went viral on Twitter a day before the inauguration were deemed fake by netizens after the Indian Express wrote a story citing an unnamed official who called the images fake. (\u2018Officials say image of signboard with wrong Tamil translation of \u2018Statue of Unity\u2019 is fake')\n\nA picture of the plaque showing 'Statue of Unity' written in several languages including French, Spanish and Indian languages such as Hindi, Tamil, Bengali caused a stir online on the eve of the inauguration.\n\nMany on Twitter pointed out that the words \u2018Statue of Unity' was misspelled in Tamil and that the script did not make sense.\n\nSome used Google Translate as proof to show that the Tamil text was wrong. Another Twitter user pointed out the gaffe was a result of transliterating the words which results in \u2018Staettukke Oppi Unity\u2019 and has no meaning in Tamil.\n\nMeanwhile the Indian Express in its story on October 31 said, \u2018a top official from the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam said that the picture of the signboard featuring the Tamil text was fake. They said no such signage was present at the site or had been pulled down.\u2019\n\nThe same story was later updated with additional quotes from the unnamed source. \u201cThe viral image of the erroneous Tamil translation of the Statue of Unity is a mischievous attempt by someone to tarnish the event that is a grand tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The actual signboard is that of the statue with its logo, stating that is a government of India project,\u201d the official said.\u201d\n\nWebqoof, the fact-checkin desk of The Quint, citing Indian Express's story published their own story with a different headline, \u2018Photo With Wrong Tamil Translation of \u2018Statue of Unity\u2019 Is Fake\u2019.\n\nThe Quint later changed its headline to \u2018Statue of Unity Signboard With Wrong Tamil Translation Removed\u2019 but did not provide any explanation for the change of headline.\n\nIndian Express's article prompted many on Twitter to call the photos fake.\n\nInterestingly, while the authenticity of the images were being debated online; a few Twitter users pointed out that Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani also tweeted the old photo of the plaque with construction workers in the background.\n\nThe old photo is part of a series of photos shared by Rupani from his official handle CMO Gujarat. The tweet was later deleted. See an archived version here.\n\nThe Images Are Not Fake\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that a similar photo was clicked by a journalist at the British Broadcasting Corporation's (BBC) Gujarati website. BBC Tamil also wrote a fact-check on November 1, 2018 explaining that while reports claimed that the photos were fake, a similar image was clicked on October 30 by Tejas Vaidya, a BBC Gujarati journalist.\n\nBOOM also reached out to the BBC who confirmed that the photo had been clicked by one of their journalists and also shared the original image with us. The original photo shows that the Tamil text on the plaque has been covered with white tape.\n\nBOOM also reached out to Sanjay Joshi, chief manager, Sardar Vallabhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust, which is responsible for the execution of the Statue of Unity project. Joshi said, \u201cYes, such a board with names in several languages exists. We have received complaints about the mistake in one of the languages and are verifying the same.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Thursday, The Hindu also did a fact-check to confirm the authenticity of the photos and found them to be true. The newspaper quoted an unnamed Gujarat government official, as saying, \u201cWe had outsourced event management works to private agencies. When it was brought to our notice, we immediately blacked it out.\u201d (Click here to read The Hindu's fact-check)", "lang": "en"}
