In the caption, the Facebook user claims the video shows members of the Workers\u2019 Party \u201cgreeting their supporters lining the road to shake hands putting COVID-19 away as if life returned to normal.\u201d\n\nThe Workers\u2019 Party is a political party in Singapore. In the general election earlier this month, it won 10 parliamentary seats, while the ruling People\u2019s Action Party secured 83 seats, retaining its power, according to BBC News.

Searching \u201cSingapore Workers\u2019 Party parade\u201d on YouTube turned up a similar video, titled \u201cWorkers Party By Pass Election Victory Parade In Hougang 7-9,\u201d that was posted in May 2012. It features many of the same people, vehicles and landmarks as the footage in the Facebook post.\n\nA bus bearing the number \u201c87\u201d can be seen passing in both videos. Singapore\u2019s 87 bus route runs along part of the city-state\u2019s Hougang Ave. 5, according to the travel app Moovit. Several landmarks visible in the videos appear in a Google Maps street view of Hougang Ave. 5, confirming the location.\n\nThe parade shown in both videos appears to have been taken at a celebration of the Workers\u2019 Party candidate Png Eng Huat\u2019s victory in the 2012 parliamentary by-election for Singapore\u2019s Hougang planning area. In both videos, he can be seen celebrating in the back of a truck adorned with a banner bearing his likeness.\n\nThat by-election happened in May 2012, so it is impossible for the footage to be related to the coronavirus pandemic. The novel coronavirus first emerged in late 2019.", "lang": "en"}
