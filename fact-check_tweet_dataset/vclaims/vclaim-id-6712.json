[This government] seems unable to find the money to support 160,000 people with debilitating mental health conditions.\u201d \u201c...this is not a policy change, this is not a cut in the amount that is going to be spent on disability benefits and no one is going to see a reduction in their benefits from that previously awarded by the DWP.\u201d\n\nTwo recent tribunal decisions widened the interpretation of Personal Independence Payments (PIP) legislation.\n\nOver 160,000 people might have seen their PIP payments go up because of the tribunal decisions\u2014or become entitled to them\u2014according to estimates from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\n\nThey won\u2019t now that the government has amended the legislation.\n\nMr Corbyn is quoting the DWP\u2019s estimates fairly and Mrs May is broadly right that people won\u2019t see their payments reduced because of the amendment (compared to what they are now).\n\nBut a relatively small number of people who were assessed after the Tribunal decisions on 28 November may see their payments fall, as and when they are next reassessed. We don\u2019t know how many, and the DWP told us that it hasn\u2019t published estimates.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more than one way to interpret the government\u2019s move.\n\nThe government says that the amendments are designed to \u201crestore the original aim of the benefit\u201d, focusing support on those who need it most.\n\nCritics say that the government is \u201cshifting the goalposts\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s a second set of questions about whether the government followed the right process when it put through the amended legislation.\n\nCritics say that the government was wrong to bypass the Social Security Advisory Committee, which is supposed to be consulted on changes to social security regulations.\n\nBut the Secretary of State can bypass the Committee if he or she thinks that it\u2019s a matter of urgency.\n\nThe government says it was right to push through the amendment fast to avoid inconsistencies in how PIP claims are assessed.", "lang": "en"}
