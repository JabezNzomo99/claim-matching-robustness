So has anything new emerged to change that assessment?\n\nThe president, in his comment, used the word \u201chelped,\u201d which is sufficiently vague that in theory it could mean any impact, no matter how slight. Yet he also cited this as a reason for not walking away from the law, which suggests he thinks it had more than a modest impact. In fact, some listeners might interpret his statement as suggesting the law has had a significant impact. However, \u201chelp\u201d could be also simply mean \u201ccontributed.\u201d\n\nSorry if this sounds too technical, but essentially it means that the index measures whether the cost of these items increase, not whether overall health care spending increases. This is important when considering some of the research on this issue. For instance, the Medicare actuaries predict growth in health care expenditures will spike starting in 2014 because of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a one-time boost which the administration official concedes could last at least three years \u2014 but the administration\u2019s price index only looks at increase in costs, not increase in quantity.\n\nIn an e-mail. Cutler acknowledged that \u201cthere is scientific disagreement on this issue.\u201d But, excluding the recession, he said he calculated that the law was one of the three biggest factors in reducing health care costs: Slowdown in rate of technological change (fewer new drugs that have been patented); increased cost sharing for consumers; and the ACA. He estimated that changes in the Medicare payment rates by itself accounted for 8 percent of the reduction.\n\nThe administration official also pointed to the ACA\u2019s reductions in Medicare spending \u2014 estimated at $17 billion in 2013 \u2014 as contributing to the slowdown in health care prices. We won\u2019t bore you with the math, but he said that about 1/7th of the post-ACA drop in the health care price inflation could be attributed to the Medicare cuts. He also pointed to a recent economic analysis that found private payers cut their payment rates by about the same amount as Medicare, suggesting possibly an even greater impact.\n\nWe try to spare our readers such an expert muddle, but at this point we have to cry uncle and say that the evidence has become too murky to reach a firm conclusion. Clearly, even economists are unsure why health-care inflation has continued to remain low so long after the end of the recession almost five years ago.\n\nIt is interesting that the president and his staff have used carefully chosen words (\u201chelped;\u201d \u201ccost of health care\u201d) that keeps him within the realm of fact on an issue on which there is little consensus. Such wordsmithing invites suspicion. The president would do better to acknowledge the impact of the recession and other factors unrelated to the Affordable Care Act before claiming bragging rights.", "lang": "en"}
