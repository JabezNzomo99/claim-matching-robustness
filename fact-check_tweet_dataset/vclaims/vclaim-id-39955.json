But the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency blamed the incident on the ferry operator\u2019s failure to coordinate with U.S. authorities as requested.\n\nThe incident of Sept. 8, 2019, was captured on video by WSVN reporter Brian Entin, who posted it via his Twitter account. In the video, a voice can be heard on the loudspeaker of a ferry docked in Freeport, Bahamas, which was getting ready to transport Dorian evacuees to Florida, instructing passengers lacking U.S. visas to disembark:\n\nThe video raised questions about whether the Trump administration had implemented a new policy requiring Bahamians traveling to the U.S. to possess travel visas, even as they were fleeing the impacts of a hurricane that left several dozen of their fellow residents dead. President Donald Trump himself added to the confusion with remarks that made it appear he was cracking down on Bahamian-storm evacuees.\n\nBut CBP officials rushed to clarify that was not the case.\n\nThe agency released a statement saying that CPB \u201cwas notified of a vessel preparing to embark an unknown number of passengers in Freeport and requested that the operator of the vessel coordinate with U.S. and Bahamian government officials in Nassau before departing The Bahamas.\u201d\n\nCBP noted in their statement that 1,500 other evacuees had arrived in Florida and were processed smoothly the day prior to the incident captured on video. Entin interviewed officials from CBP in Florida once the ferry arrived, who said that had the ferry operator, Balearia Caribbean, coordinated with them, the problem could have been avoided:\n\nWe reached out to Balearia Caribbean for comment and did not receive a response. However, the company did issue an apology, with CNN quoting them as saying, \u201cWe boarded these passengers with the understanding that they could travel to the United States without visas, only to later [be] advised that in order to travel to Ft. Lauderdale they required prior in-person authorization from the immigration authorities in Nassau.\u201d\n\nMany Bahamians don\u2019t need travel visas to enter the U.S. and can receive clearance prior to traveling if they meet certain requirements, including possession of a valid passport and lack of a criminal record. In the aftermath of the incident, acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan took to Twitter to clarify that this situation has not changed:\n\nMorgan further stressed during a press conference that CBP was engaged in a humanitarian mission in the Bahamas: \u201cIf your life is in jeopardy and you\u2019re in the Bahamas \u2026 you\u2019re going to be allowed to come to the United States, whether you have travel documents or not.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
