Its country-by-country analysis of the date and type of travel restrictions shows that in the days after the World Health Organization on Jan. 30 declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, 36 countries imposed travel restrictions, including the U.S., by Feb. 2.\n\n\u201cWhat this data shows is that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,\u201d a co-author of the tracker, Samantha Kiernan, a research associate on global health, economics, and development at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us via email.\n\nA day after the WHO decision, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency for the U.S. for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S.\n\nAs we have written, Trump was wrong to call the policy a \u201ctravel ban\u201d or to claim that he \u201cclosed up\u201d all travel between the countries. There were exceptions, including for Americans and their family members and for trade. Trump also has repeatedly and misleadingly cast his decision to impose the travel restrictions as a \u201cbold\u201d move made \u201cagainst the advice of almost everybody.\u201d Azar said the decision stemmed from \u201cthe uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that his decision to impose the travel restrictions on China \u201chad Biden calling me xenophobic\u201d and \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nOn the day the White House announced the travel restrictions, Biden did say at a campaign event in Iowa that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans \u201cneed to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2013 hysterical xenophobia \u2013 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign says Biden\u2019s \u201creference to xenophobia was about Trump\u2019s long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China,\u201d and that he was not talking about the travel ban.\n\nOn April 3, Biden\u2019s campaign said Biden supported Trump\u2019s decision to impose travel restrictions on China.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, told CNN. \u201cScience supported this ban, therefore he did too.\u201d\n\nIn a coronavirus task force press briefing on April 4, Trump asked if people had seen the \u201cbreaking news\u201d that Biden \u201cagreed that [Trump] was correct when I stopped people from China very early \u2014 very, very early \u2014 from coming into our country.\u201d\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on April 5, Biden responded that while he agreed with the travel restrictions on China, he didn\u2019t think the president acted with enough \u201curgency.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kiernan, co-creator of the ThinkGlobalHealth tracker on travel restrictions on China, 46 countries and territories (Macau and Hong Kong) imposed travel restrictions on China that came into effect before the United States\u2019 restrictions did. (Although the U.S. announced its travel restrictions on Jan. 31, they did not go into effect until Feb. 2.) Twelve other countries\u2019 travel restrictions against China came into effect on Feb. 2, the same day as the U.S.\n\nMost of those countries\u2019 decisions came in the days immediately after the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, Kiernan said.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, the United States was one of the first Western countries to impose any kind of formal travel restriction against China,\u201d Kiernan told us. \u201cWith the exceptions of the Czech Republic (suspended visas seven days after U.S. implemented restrictions) and Italy (suspended flights two days before U.S. implemented restrictions), the EU did not impose travel restrictions against China specifically. Australia imposed its entry ban on travelers from China, which was quite similar to the United States\u2019, one day before the United States acted. New Zealand and Israel imposed their travel bans on the same day as the United States.\u201d\n\nIn general, she said, the earliest countries to impose travel restrictions against China were Asian and Pacific countries.\n\n\u201cThe Marshall Islands, for instance, imposed the earliest travel ban against China on January 24,\u201d Kiernan said. \u201cNorth Korea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Macau, Kazakhstan, Micronesia, Laos, Malaysia, etc. all imposed some form of travel restriction against China in January as well. A few African nations imposed travel restrictions against China in January as well, such as Mauritius and Seychelles.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking this all together, what this data shows is that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,\u201d Kiernan said.\n\nThe United States announced its restrictions the day after the WHO declared a public health emergency, \u201cand those restrictions came into effect two days later. However, to say the United States was one of the first countries to impose an entry ban on travelers from China would be incorrect,\u201d she said. \u201cBy my count, roughly twenty countries and territories (Hong Kong) imposed entry bans similar if not more stringent than the U.S. ban prior to the United States imposing its restrictions.\u201d\n\nThat contradicts the narratives of both Trump and Biden.\n\nCorrection, May 4: We originally misspelled Kate Bedingfield\u2019s last name.
