The photos are being used in a misleading context; they do show Muslim groups surrendering weapons, but the event took place in 2009, not after the 2019 attacks.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts contain the set of four photos, for example this one published on May 25, 2019, which has been shared more than 4,300 times since.\n\nThe pictures show large guns, grenades and bullets lined up on a table.\n\nAlso visible in the images are men sitting on the floor, some wearing white skullcaps, and other men in military uniform. In one of the photos, a bearded man in a skullcap can be seen giving a gun to a uniformed officer.\n\nThat post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption translates to English as:\n\n\"The event at which Kattankudy Muslim people handed over a haul of T56 weapons, hand grenades, live ammunition and many other weapon varieties, which they had kept to cut jackfruit\"\n\nT56 is a type of assault rifle. Kattankudy is a town in eastern Sri Lanka with a large Muslim population. It is the hometown of Zahran Hashim, the mastermind of the 2019 Easter attacks that killed more than 250 people. Here is an AFP article about Hashim and his accomplices.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same four images were shared elsewhere on Facebook with the same or similar claims, for example here, and on Twitter here.\n\nMany of the misleading posts use similar phrases about the purpose of the weapons -- for example, to \"cut jackfruit\" here or to \"play cricket\" in this post published to Facebook on May 25, 2019.\n\nThe phrases are a reference to May 2, 2019 comments by Sri Lanka\u2019s Muslim Affairs Minister M H A Haleem, who told a news conference that swords found in mosques were used to \"clear shrubs\", as reported here by national newspaper the Daily Mirror.\n\nSome of the Facebook posts, such as this one published May 25, 2019, contain a clear reference to Haleem\u2019s words and call for an explanation from him about the weapons haul.\n\nThat post's caption, translated to English, translates as:\n\n\"Cache of weapons were handed over in the presence of the dog, the Eastern Governor. Now we call upon Muslim Affairs Minister A C S Haleem to explain the purpose of these weapons. He will say it was to prevent wild boar attacks on mosques; the weapons were used to shoot them away\u2026! Muslim organisations will hold pressers and say it was tradition for every household to have a T56 gun and that it was to protect their girl children\"\n\nAll the claims are misleading; the photos do not show a recent handover of weapons.\n\nThe images were actually taken in Kattankudy a decade ago at an event held on July 4, 2009, where Muslim militant groups surrendered a cache of weapons in response to an appeal made by the government.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex led to this article published on the official Sri Lanka Army website, which contains the same images as in the misleading posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article, headlined \u201cIslamic Fractions Hand Over their Weapons\u201d:\n\nThe Sri Lankan army page does not give an upload date for the images or the article, but a Google keyword search using the terms in the headline found news reports from 2009 about the event.\n\nFor example, this Sunday Times report dated July 5, 2009, says:\n\n\"Eastern Province Muslim militant groups responding to a government amnesty yesterday surrendered dozens of automatic weapons before a major crackdown by the authorities, Police said.\"\n\nThe screenshot comparison below shows that the men who appear in the photo in the 2009 report (top) are the same as in one of the images in the misleading Facebook post (bottom), with the same distinctive facial features and clothing:\n\nAnother article about the 2009 weapons handover was published here on the Tamil Net news website.\n\nIt says, in part: \u201cEastern Muslim armed groups Saturday afternoon initially handed over dozens of automatic weapons including sixteen T 56 rifles to the police in response to the amnesty period that ended on July 4 afternoon 3:00 p.m.\n\n\"The event took place in Kaaththaankudi Jumma Meera Mosque in the presence of the Eastern Deputy Inspector General of Police Edison Gunatilake and Provincial Minister M. L. A. M.Hisbullah.\u201d\n\nAgain, there are distinctive elements in the report's photo which match those in the misleading posts, such as the same uniformed men, rows of guns on a white table and bags of ammunition.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the Tamil Net report (top) and another of the images in the misleading Facebook post (bottom), with the corresponding elements highlighted:\n\nAFP spoke to Sri Lanka's Military Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu, who said in a WhatsApp message dated June 3, 2019:\n\n\"Those photos were posted many years ago in the Army website, when a general amnesty was declared by the then government, soon after the Eastern Province was cleared of LTTE terrorism.\"\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam or LTTE ended in May, 2009.\n\nHere is an AFP article about the 10 year anniversary of the war\u2019s end, published May 18, 2019.\n\nBrigadier Atapattu added that while he was unable to specify the exact date the images were taken, he could confirm it was prior to 2010.", "lang": "en"}
