Actually, he said that Trump would be re-elected if Democrats wage a negative campaign.\n\nA clip of former Vice President Joe Biden speaking in Missouri on March 7 has racked up hundreds of thousands of likes, shares, and views on conservative social media accounts. But it\u2019s misleadingly edited.\n\nBiden, March 7: If you want a nominee who will bring this party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign, and turn, turn this primary from a campaign that\u2019s about negative attacks into one about what we\u2019re for, because we cannot get re-elect, we cannot win this re-election \u2014 excuse me, we can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here \u2014 it\u2019s got to be a positive campaign, so join us.\u201d\n\nThe clipped version cuts off the last part of Biden\u2019s statement, making it look like he finished his thought by saying, \u201c[W]e can only re-elect Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe original video shared on Biden\u2019s YouTube channel got 21,000 views as of March 9. While one version of the edited clip drew more than 95,000 views on YouTube.\n\nIt has also been widely shared on Twitter, where the president retweeted two versions of the clipped video \u2014 one from the director of social media at the White House, Dan Scavino, and one from the founder of the conservative organization Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk.\n\nTwitter labeled the edited video as \u201cmanipulated media\u201d under its new policy to address fake or misleading videos, audio, and pictures. This is the first time that Twitter has used the label since implementing the policy on March 5, according to the company. As of March 9, though, a technical glitch was keeping the label from showing up on some views of the tweet, according to Twitter. When the label is working correctly, users can click through to see news coverage about the deceptive editing.\n\nThe edited clip has also been shared on Facebook and Instagram, where one version replaced the Biden campaign sign on the podium with a Trump campaign sign and Donald Trump Jr. shared a version with text over the top that said: \u201cWe can only re-elect Donald Trump.\u201d The president\u2019s son also included some laughter emojis, perhaps suggesting that Biden \u2013 who is known for gaffes \u2013 had accidentally endorsed Trump.\n\nBut none of these posts accurately reflect what Biden actually said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Tune in to watch live:\u201d YouTube. 7 Mar 2020.\n\nScavino, Dan (@DanScavino). \u201cSleepy Joe in St. Louis, Missouri today: \u2018We can only re-elect @realDonaldTrump.\u2019 #KAG2020LandslideVictory.\u201d Twitter. 7 Mar 2020.\n\nTrump, Donald Jr. (donaldjtrumpjr). \u201cWe are 100% with you on this one Joe. It\u2019s truly sad to me that the Democrats and even his family are allowing this charade to continue. This is just one of hundreds of examples of a man that is totally not with it. If @realdonaldtrump made one of these slips once a year everyone in the media would say he has lost his mind. When Joe does it every day and confuses simple things (Like which office he\u2019s running for, which person is his wife, what state he\u2019s in, and who he can appoint to various positions) they say it\u2019s cute and funny. It\u2019s no longer cute or funny and they must stop the nonsense.\u201d Instagram. 8 Mar 2020.", "lang": "en"}
