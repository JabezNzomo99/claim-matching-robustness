The claim is misleading; the Philippine Supreme Court ruled Aquino\u2019s government legitimate at least twice in 1986 during her presidential term.\n\nThis Facebook post was published on March 1, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states, in part: \u201c1986 FACT / Arturo Tolentino was the duly elected Vice President of the Republic of the Philippines in 1986. Marcos left the palace because of the the people power revolt led by the YELLOW COALITION. / According to the contitutions [sic], the VP authomatically [sic] becomes the President if the President dies or removed from the office. Therefore, CORY AQUINO's Presidency is unconstitutional. TOLENTINO is the REAL President from 1986 to 1992.\u201d\n\nThe caption refers to the 1986 Philippines presidential elections that saw the toppling of dictator Ferdinand Marcos, ending his 20-year rule.\n\nWhen the incumbent Marcos and his running mate Arturo Tolentino proclaimed themselves victor of the presidential elections on February 20, 1986, a vote marred by widespread reports of electoral fraud, Aquino and the opposition led a four-day demonstration that resulted in a wave of military defections and a prolonged nationwide strike. Marcos departed for exile in Hawaii and Aquino was sworn in as the elected President on February 25.\n\nInformation sheets have been published by the government about the 1986 elections here and the People Power Revolution here.\n\nA similar claim, published alongside a photo of Tolentino, have also been shared on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the Philippine Supreme Court ruled former President Corazon Aquino\u2019s government legitimate at least twice in 1986.\n\nIn this May 22, 1986 ruling, the Supreme Court resolved three petitions which questioned the legality of Aquino\u2019s presidency, saying \u201cthe people have made the judgment\u201d.\n\nThe court said, in part: \u201cFor the legitimacy of the Aquino government is not a justiciable matter. It belongs to the realm of politics where only the people of the Philippines are the judge. And the people have made the judgment; they have accepted the government of President Corazon C. Aquino which is in effective control of the entire country so that it is not merely a de facto government but is in fact and law a de jure government. Moreover, the community of nations has recognized the legitimacy of the present government.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the court\u2019s resolution:\n\nThe court again ruled on October 24, 1986, dismissing another petition questioning the validity of Aquino\u2019s government: \u201cThere can be no question that President Corazon C. Aquino and Vice-President Salvador H. Laurel are the incumbent and legitimate President and Vice-President of the Republic of the Philippines.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the resolution:", "lang": "en"}
