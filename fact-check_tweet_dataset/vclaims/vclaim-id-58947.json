Stone was convicted of witness tampering, lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation.\n\nA federal judge had sentenced Stone to the 40-month prison term in February, following the withdrawal of the four main prosecutors from Stone\u2019s case after the Justice Department intervened to water down their sentencing recommendation.\n\nThe White House statement largely echoed Trump\u2019s rhetoric over the years in dismissing the probe into Russia\u2019s election meddling as a \"hoax.\" We found four new statements about Stone\u2019s trial and conviction that needed a fact-check.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation was not limited to examining the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts and potential coordination with Russia \u2014 an alleged criminal conspiracy that the probe did not establish, according to the report.\n\nStone\u2019s indictment was the final prosecution brought by Mueller\u2019s team. The case was later taken over by federal prosecutors, including some who had worked on Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nTwo of the four main prosecutors who withdrew from the case after the Justice Department stepped in to reduce their sentencing recommendation had previously worked on Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation: Aaron Zelinsky and Adam Jed.\n\nThe prosecutors had recommended that Stone receive a seven- to nine-year prison sentence, a request that was within federal sentencing guidelines for Stone\u2019s offenses.\n\nFormer Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein authorized Mueller as special counsel to investigate any coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, as well as \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from that investigation.\"\n\nMueller said the investigation was justified in pursuing Stone.\n\n\"Stone became a central figure in our investigation for two key reasons: He communicated in 2016 with individuals known to us to be Russian intelligence officers, and he claimed advance knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 release of emails stolen by those Russian intelligence officers,\" Mueller wrote in an op-ed published after Trump commuted Stone\u2019s sentence.\n\nThe Mueller investigation was not baseless.\n\nA mountain of evidence produced by the U.S. intelligence agencies \u2014 and Mueller \u2014 confirmed that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election with the intention of boosting Trump. Their contacts with his campaign did not amount to criminal conspiracy, the Mueller probe found.\n\nSeveral federal courts upheld the legitimacy of Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel in the face of legal challenges, including from Stone.\n\nMore recently, a report from Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz concluded that the FBI\u2019s decision to open the investigation Mueller later inherited was justified. It had both an \"authorized purpose\" and an \"articulable factual basis,\" Horowitz wrote in the report.\n\nThe FBI opened the investigation, known as \"Crossfire Hurricane,\" in 2016, after it heard from a \"friendly foreign government\" that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos had signaled that Russia had dirt for the campaign on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nStone\u2019s conviction was related specifically to false statements he made and actions he took that impeded a congressional investigation into Russian election interference, according to his indictment and the prosecution\u2019s original sentencing recommendation.\n\nStone\u2019s conviction remains on the books, even if he never sets foot behind bars. And while the longtime Republican operative is appealing his conviction, his crimes are no longer \"alleged.\"\n\nA jury found Stone guilty in November of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to Congress, and tampering with a witness.\n\n\"Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes,\" Mueller wrote in his op-ed. \"He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so.\"\n\nStone motioned for a new trial over alleged bias and misconduct by the jury foreperson, Tomeka Hart. But U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson denied the bid in April.\n\nThe White House statement said Stone \"deserves a fair trial\" and that Hart \"concealed the fact that she is a member of the so-called liberal \u2018resistance\u2019 to the Trump Presidency,\" which Stone\u2019s defense argued can be gleaned from negative social media posts about Trump.\n\nJackson, in an 81-page opinion, dismissed Stone\u2019s allegations of misconduct. \"The Court finds that the foreperson did not answer questions falsely on the questionnaire or during voir dire, she did not engage in misconduct during the trial, and the defendant did not use diligence to discover the information present in his motion,\" Jackson wrote in conclusion.\n\nJackson said Stone\u2019s legal defense team failed to prove that Hart\u2019s posts demonstrated that she made false statements during the jury selection process. Jackson also wrote that the defense did not object to Hart\u2019s selection to the jury at the time, and that Hart\u2019s opinions about Trump did not \"reveal that she had an opinion about Roger Stone, which is the opinion that matters.\"\n\n\"The assumption underlying the motion \u2014 that one can infer from the juror\u2019s opinions about the President that she could not fairly consider the evidence against the defendant \u2014 is not supported by any facts or data and it is contrary to controlling legal precedent,\" Jackson wrote.\n\nOn Feb. 25, Jackson called the jury back for questioning on whether anything problematic had occurred behind closed doors during the trial. The two jury members questioned said nothing untoward had taken place, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the jury\u2019s decision in Stone\u2019s case \u2014 as is required for criminal cases \u2014 was unanimous.\n\n\"The evidence in this case was substantial and almost entirely uncontested,\" wrote one juror in a 2019 Washington Post op-ed defending the verdict.\n\nAttorney General William Barr said in a recent ABC interview that Stone\u2019s prosecution was \"righteous\" and \"appropriate\" and that the 40-month sentence was \"fair\" \u2014 a contrast to the White House statement\u2019s claim that Stone had an \"unfair prosecution, arrest, and trial.\"\n\nZelinsky, one of the prosecutors who withdrew from Stone\u2019s case after the Justice Department reduced their sentencing request, testified that he was told Stone actually got \"unprecedentedly favorable treatment\" in his sentencing because of his relationship with Trump.", "lang": "en"}
