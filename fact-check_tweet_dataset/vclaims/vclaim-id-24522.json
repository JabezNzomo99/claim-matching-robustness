Several users on Facebook have posted the images with the claim that one of the two Hindu girls who had observed Roza was beaten by her Muslim husband and that their union is a case of \u2018Love Jihad\u2019. The message circulated with the images is posted below.\n\nTranslation \u2013 You would remember the news about two Hindu daughters -Shivani and Riya- setting an example of Hindu-Muslim unity. This news had gone viral during the month of Ramzan. Why did they do it? That also should be told? Shivani had observed the Roza at first but then her husband had thrashed her. The whole Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb [India\u2019s syncretic Hindu-Muslim culture] has vanished. That was Love-Jihad with Shivani, now she is suffering. Hopefully, soon if you see any such photo of Riya then don\u2019t be surprised. There should be consequences for foolishness.\n\nTwitter user Shailendra Pratap also posted the images with a similar claim.\n\nThe pictures are also getting circulated on Facebook and Twitter with a similar narrative.\n\nA Google reverse image search of the photograph of the scarred woman led us to an article published by Pakistani news organization Geo TV on March 29, 2019. The article identified the woman as Hajra who had alleged that she was tortured by her husband and had suffered various injuries. \u201cMeanwhile, the medical report of Hajra, whose husband was arrested a day earlier from Lahore\u2019s Askari 10 area for torturing her for not bringing money from her parents, stated that she has a broken nose and suffered injuries to her jaw\u201d, stated the report.\n\nThe newspaper clipping circulated along with Hajra\u2019s photo pertains to a separate case where two Hindu women \u2013 Shivani and Riya \u2013 from Madhya Pradesh kept a one-day fast on Ramzan as a gesture promoting Hindu-Muslim unity. The newspaper clipping is of Dainik Bhaskar\u2019s June 4 report. A video of the two girls speaking about their fast is also available on YouTube.\n\nIn conclusion, a photo of an injured woman from Pakistan was shared along with a news report from India about two girls observing Roza. This was done in an attempt to give the impression that the two incidents are related.", "lang": "en"}
