The same ISI which engineered attack on our Parliament and attacks in Mumbai. Present Indian Government did not give visa to Asad Durrani to attend his book launch.\"\n\nThe photo with the same context is being shared on WhatsApp as well as Twitter.\n\nBut the same image was viral earlier this year as well on all social media platforms with the same false narrative claiming that the author of the book is Pakistan's ISI's former Chief Assad Durrani.\n\nFake news website Postcard News also wrote an article calling all the people present at the book launch as traitors in its story titled \"Congress exposed once again! Senior Congress leaders including Manmohan Singh launches ex ISI chief's book even after Modi govt. denied him Visa.\"\n\nYou can read the story here.\n\nYou can access the archived version of the article here.\n\nThe image is from May 24, 2018 and the part of the message which says that the book, 'The Spy Chronicles: RAW, ISI and the Illusion of Peace' was launched in India by Manmohan Singh, Hamid Ansari and a few others is also correct. But an important point that all the posts have left out is that the book is not just written by Assad Durrani but actually written by three authors - Indian journalist Aditya Sinha, India's former RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) chief AS Dulat, and the former head of Pakistan's ISI, Assad Durrani.\n\nFormer Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha along with Farooq Abdulla, Shiv Shankar Menon and Barkha Dutt were also present at the launch of the book.\n\nThe cover of the book has the names of all the three authors.\n\nPublisher Harper Collins also tweeted about the book release by Dr. Farooq Abdullah, Dr. Manmohan Singh and Shri Hamid Ansari in the presence of Yashwant Sinha, Kapil Sibal, Barkha Dutt, Mr. Shiv Shankar Menon and Mr. K.M Singh.\n\n\"The book has been styled as a conversation between two spymasters covers a wide range of subjects including NSA Ajit Doval's way of functioning, the Kashmir issue and several thorny issues between India and Pakistan including Kulbhushan Jadhav, Balochistan and surgical strikes,\" a Press Trust of India article carried by The Times of India stated.\n\nThe book launch did not create a controversy in India at the time.\n\nPakistan's ISI's former chief Assad Durrani could not attend the book launch that happened in India as he was denied a visa. Durrani had even jokingly thanked India's government for denying him a visa to attend the event. \"By denying me the visa, they saved me from the wrath of our hawks at home,\u201d Asad Durrani, said in videotaped remarks sent to the audience in New Delhi from Pakistan, reported the New York Times.", "lang": "en"}
