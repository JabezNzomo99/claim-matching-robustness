It also failed to clarify what \u201cdown in drugs\u201d meant.\n\nThe post referred to Trump\u2019s statement after the 12th East Asia Summit at the Philippine International Convention Center in Pasay City on November 14, 2017. In that statement, he did not talk about drugs nor crime in the Philippines.\n\nThe facts: Trump said Duterte is doing a \u201cgreat and sensible job\u201d in curbing drugs and criminality, according to then Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella on May 2, 2017. No exact figure was stated.\n\n\n\nIn the embedded video, Trump celebrated the \u201cvery strong\u201d US-Philippines relationship. He called Philippines the \u201cmost prime piece of real estate from a military standpoint.\u201d\n\nThe full transcript of the speech is available at www.whitehouse.gov.\n\n\n\nThe only reported instance Trump himself congratulated Duterte on the administration's anti-drugs operations was on April 29, 2017. \"You are doing an amazing job,\" Trump said to Duterte according to the leaked transcript reported by US-based investigative magazine The Intercept on May 24, 2017.\n\nThere have been other hoax stories regarding crime in the Philippines. The most recent is claiming the \u201canti-tambay\u201d operations led to a decrease in Metro Manila\u2019s crime incidence, when no official reports have been released yet.\n\nThe blog lacks an editorial board and a company profile. It does have its contact details and an \u201cadmin\u201d author in all of its posts since its first on May 9. \u2013 Miguel Imperial/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
