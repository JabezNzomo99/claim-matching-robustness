A sitting governor goes on national television and when he is called out for an obvious falsehood, he simply repeats the inaccurate talking points over and over.\n\nAfter Donald Trump raised the bogus birther issue in 2011, while testing the waters for a presidential run, President Obama released his long-form birth certificate on April 27, 2011. Yet Trump refused to take that as an acceptable response. Here are some of his tweets:\n\nEven after Trump starting running for president last year, he continued to question the president\u2019s background in television interviews.\n\nIn August 2015, Trump earned Four Pinocchios for falsely claiming that Obama spent $4 million to keep his college records hidden. He made this statement while deflecting a question about his birther comments that left in doubt his position on whether the president was a natural-born U.S. citizen: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like talking about it anymore because, honestly, I have my own feelings.\u201d Trump, like many of his surrogates, also falsely claimed that Hillary Clinton or her 2008 campaign originated the birther controversy.\n\nNot until Friday \u2014 Sept. 16, 2016 \u2014 did Trump firmly say he believed Obama was born in the United States. But he did not apologize \u2014 and he again falsely accused Clinton of starting the controversy.\n\nThis is such bogus spin that we have to wonder how Christie manages to say it with a straight face. Regular readers know we shy away from using the word \u201clie,\u201d but clearly Christie is either lying or he is so misinformed that he has no business appearing on television.\n\nKudos to Tapper for refusing to let Christie get away with it.", "lang": "en"}
