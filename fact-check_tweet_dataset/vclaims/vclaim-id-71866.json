The claim is false; all the images are from protests in Europe; nearly all were taken at \u201cyellow vest\u201d rallies in France.\n\nThe images were published on Facebook here on August 13, 2019, and have since been shared more than 300 times.\n\nEach of the 12 images depicts street clashes between uniformed police or soldiers and protesters -- and they all have superimposed captions claiming the photos show police violence in Hong Kong.\n\nTranslated from the traditional Chinese script, the text accompanying the images says: \u201cSee! Water cannons have been put into use, do Hong Kong police want to kill these people? They even beat up journalists and solitary women, and threw stones at people. Are there no rules in Hong Kong? Really no way can I bear this!\u201d It ends with a hashtag that reads: \u201cShare and show this to the world.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nPosts featuring the same series of images have been published elsewhere on Facebook with similar captions, such as here and here.\n\nPro-democracy protesters have staged weeks of rallies in Hong Kong that have often descended into violent clashes with police, as detailed in this AFP report from August 18.\n\nBut none of the photos in the misleading posts are from Hong Kong.
