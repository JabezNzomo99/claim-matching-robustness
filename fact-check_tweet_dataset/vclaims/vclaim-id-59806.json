The claim is based on a real NFL initiative that created a $250 million fund to \u201ccombat systemic racism and support the battle against the ongoing and historic injustices faced by African-Americans.\u201d The NFL statement announcing the fund further said that the money will go to \u201csupport[ing] programs to address criminal justice reform, police reforms, and economic and educational advancement.\u201d However, it did not state what specifically these \u201cprograms\u201d are.\n\nAn article on NFL\u2019s website said that before this latest pledge, the NFL had donated \u201c$44 million to its social justice programs\u201d which funded \u201c20 national social justice grant partners and made matching contributions to 350 local grassroots organizations identified by players and former players.\u201d\n\nThe article states that the NFL will work with players to find programs to support. While new partners have not yet been announced, leaving it possible that some of the $250 million will end up going to the Black Lives Matter Foundation or another BLM-affiliated organization, when asked if the whole of the fund would go to BLM, Brian McCarthy, the NFL\u2019s vice president for communications, told The Dispatch Fact Check: \u201cNo that\u2019s not accurate.\u201d\n\nThe fund will support a number of programs and groups rather than just giving the entire $250 million to one group, and McCarthy gave examples of grant recipients from the NFL\u2019s past social justice work, which included the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law & Justice; the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Social Change; and the UNCF.", "lang": "en"}
