The 40-second video was shared with a caption in Hindi that translates to, \u201cPreparation for 8 pm tonight.\u201d\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room has found that the video is four years old. The video was shot in 2016 when PM Modi met Madame Tussauds artistes at his New Delhi residence. Madame Tussauds is a famous museum chain known for lifelike wax statues of famous personalities.\n\nIn 2016, PM Modi joined the list of powerful world leaders to have a wax figure at the four major Madame Tussauds museums in London, Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok. This was widely reported at that time by all mainstream media.\n\nA team of artistes from Madame Tussauds had arrived at Modi\u2019s residence months before to collect details of his physical attributes, including his eye color, hair texture and skin complexion, so as to meticulously replicate his wax statue.\n\nThe entire process was recorded and shot by the Madame Tussauds team. On March 16, it was uploaded on YouTube with the caption, \u201cNarendra Modi\u2019s sitting| Madame Tussauds London\u201d.\n\nThis particular video has been misused several times with misleading claims such as PM Modi spending lakhs of rupees on his makeup. AFWA had earlier debunked this claim.\n\nREAD | Aatm nirbhar Bharat: PM Modi calls for self-reliance to achieve global leadership after Covid-19 crisis\n\nREAD | PM Modi speech: Lockdown 4.0 to Rs 20 lakh economic package for land, labour and liquidity | Key takeaways\n\nWATCH | Lockdown 4.0 will be based on states' suggestions: PM Modi", "lang": "en"}
