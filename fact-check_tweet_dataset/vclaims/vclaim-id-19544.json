Others linked his death to President Donald Trump. And still others falsely claimed that Epstein never died at all.\n\nNone of those claims are backed by available evidence \u2014 and some are rooted in decades-old, long-debunked conspiracy theories. But social media posts promoting them have amassed tens of thousands of shares on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSome of those posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nOfficials initially said Epstein, who was accused of abusing and trafficking underage girls, hanged himself. The New York City medical examiner's office finished an autopsy soon after he was found but said it needed \"further information\" to formally conclude a cause of death. Federal investigators are still in the early stages of parsing through the particulars of Epstein\u2019s death out of an \"abundance of caution.\"\n\nUntil we get more concrete details about Epstein\u2019s death, we\u2019re not rating claims that speculate about the factors that caused it. But conspiracies about Epstein are rampant on social media, so we wanted to check out the most viral ones and go through the facts.\n\nWhat we know about Epstein\u2019s death\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start with some real facts about Epstein\u2019s death.\n\nGuards doing morning rounds at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan found him dead around 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10 from an apparent hanging. His death came a little more than two weeks after another attempt on his own life, also by hanging.\n\nNews reports have said that Epstein had been taken off suicide watch about a week prior to his death. Two guards were supposed to check on him regularly but weren\u2019t following that protocol the night he died. He also didn\u2019t have a cellmate and was alone the night of his death.\n\nCriminal justice experts say that suicide is endemic in American jails. A 2016 federal report found that suicide was the leading cause of death in local jails in 2014 \u2014 the last year for which such data were released \u2014 and accounted for 35% of all jail inmate deaths.\n\nInvestigators are still looking into Epstein\u2019s death. But considering he was potentially facing 45 years in prison if convicted, the high rates of suicide in American jails and Epstein\u2019s previous attempt on his own life, foul play remains highly unlikely.\n\nIn the hours after news broke about Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide, the term \"Clintons\" and #ClintonBodyCount started trending behind \"Epstein\" on Twitter. While the posts varied, the central, baseless claim they made remained the same: that the Clintons somehow orchestrated Epstein\u2019s death.\n\n\"Died of SUICIDE on 24/7 SUICIDE WATCH ? Yeah right! How does that happen,\" Terrence Williams, a comedian with more than 500,000 followers, tweeted Aug. 10, racking up more than 68,000 retweets. \"#JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton & now he\u2019s dead.\"\n\nAs of now, there is no evidence to suggest foul play in Epstein\u2019s death, much less that it was coordinated by a former president. But according to Hoaxy, a tool that visualizes the spread of tweets, Williams\u2019 post was among the most-shared tweets with #ClintonBodyCount \u2014 thanks in part to a retweet from President Trump.\n\nA top U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department official amplified the conspiracy on Instagram. Williams cross-posted his claim in a video on Facebook, where it got more than 400,000 views. We found several other posts on Facebook that were shared thousands of times.\n\nThe conspiracy that the Clintons kill people is not new. In a 1998 fact check about a list of people purportedly murdered by the Clintons, Snopes wrote that similar rumors had been circulating \"for about 20 years.\" The fact-checking site researched dozens of people on the bogus hit list and rated the hoax false.\n\nPolitiFact has also done extensive fact-checking of conspiracies about the Clintons killing people. In each case, we rated those hoaxes False or Pants on Fire \u2014 our worst ratings.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the second component of Clinton-related conspiracies \u2014 the financier\u2019s connection to the former president. This has some basis in fact, but Clinton\u2019s staff has downplayed the connection.\n\nDuring his life, Epstein made the acquaintance of many powerful people, including Bill Clinton. The former president rode on the financier\u2019s private jet more than a dozen times in the early 2000s, according to flight logs published by Gawker in 2015. A 2016 report from Fox News increased that number to at least 26. Clinton recruited Epstein\u2019s plane for a week-long humanitarian trip to Africa in 2002, before the financier was publicly accused of wrongdoing.\n\nA recent statement, which the former president\u2019s press secretary tweeted July 8, alleged that Clinton took four trips on Epstein\u2019s plane: one to Europe, one to Asia and two to Africa, some of which included stops for work connected to the Clinton Foundation. As the Times noted, it\u2019s unclear how many individual flights were made during each trip, which could account for the discrepancy.\n\nThe statement also said Clinton visited Epstein\u2019s New York apartment once in 2002, during which he was accompanied by a staff member and security detail. Clinton also met with the financier, according to the statement, in the former president\u2019s Harlem office in 2002.\n\nClinton denied knowing anything about Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes and said in the statement that he hasn\u2019t \"spoken to Epstein in well over a decade.\" Prosecutors and other officials have not linked the former president to the accusations against Epstein.\n\nClinton is not the only high-profile person to have had contact with Epstein over the years. Documents show that President Trump rode on the financier\u2019s private jet and reportedly partied with him in the late 1990s.\n\nBut Clinton has not been accused of having sex with minors connected to Epstein, as has been alleged about other famous men. Trump was accused of having sex with a minor in an anonymous 2016 lawsuit, which was dropped that same year and hasn't been corroborated. Trump does not currently stand accused of any sexual misconduct related to Epstein, according to recently released documents about the financier's alleged sex trafficking operation.\n\nDespite all the available facts, the Clintons were still the main target for conspiracists following Epstein\u2019s death. Why? One potential reason is the fact that there's already a lot of existing misinformation about them.\n\nCorrection, Aug. 13, 2019: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Trump had not been accused of having sex with minors connected to Jeffrey Epstein.", "lang": "en"}
