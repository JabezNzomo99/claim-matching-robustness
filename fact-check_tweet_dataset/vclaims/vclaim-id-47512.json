Asked if she would promise not to lie to the media, McEnany said, \u201cI will never lie to you, you have my word on that.\u201d\n\nShe did, however, repeat a falsehood that others in the administration, including the president, have told before about the Russia probe that consumed the first two years of his administration. On the day the Mueller report was issued on April 18, 2019, Trump tweeted: \u201cNO COLLUSION \u2013 NO OBSTRUCTION.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the investigation \u201cdid not establish that the [Trump] Campaign conspired and coordinated with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\u201d\n\nHowever, as we have written, the report said this about the issue of obstruction of justice: \u201cOur investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels,\u201d the report said. \u201cThese actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General\u2019s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the report did not recommend the prosecution of Trump and stated that the special counsel did not have the authority to do so. It cited an opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel that said \u201cthe indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions\u201d in violation of \u201cthe constitutional separation of powers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\u201d the report said.\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr sent a letter to Congress on March 24, 2019, that said the department would not bring charges against the president. \u201cDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\u201d Barr said.\n\nBut the report\u2019s findings on obstruction of justice were reinforced in May 2019 by a statement that Mueller read at the Department of Justice.\n\nThat\u2019s not a \u201ccomplete and total exoneration of President Trump,\u201d as the new press secretary said.\n\nFactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
