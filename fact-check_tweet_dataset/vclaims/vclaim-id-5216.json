Earlier, a video post showing a team of footballers praying and singing in a hotel room claiming that they belonged to the Croatian national team had gone viral on social media. But as it turned out, the players belonged to a Brazilian club football team.\n\nAnother video that went viral during the World Cup football season claimed that the angry Brazilian fans hurled stones and eggs at a bus after their team's exit with a 2-1 loss to Belgium in the quarter-finals. The video was also carried by prominent Indian news websites. However, once again, the video was taken from another unrelated incident that happened much before the World Cup.", "lang": "en"}
