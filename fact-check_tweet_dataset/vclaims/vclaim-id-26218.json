The photo is doctored and Canadians are not allowed to cover their faces in Ontario driver\u2019s licence pictures.\n\n\u201cHow is this legal,\u201d wonders one Facebook user who posted a photo of an Ontario driver\u2019s license that includes a person whose face is entirely covered by a black veil, or niqab.\n\nOn a Russian news website, the same photo was used in an article claiming that the license was actually from Brazil.\n\nIn fact, the photo is fake and it is not legal to cover one\u2019s face in a photo used for an Ontario driver\u2019s licence.\n\nA reverse image search reveals that the image was doctored from a sample photo of an Ontario driver\u2019s licence. The name is blurred on the licence featuring the person in a niqab, whereas the original states \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d All the other information on the licence, such as the birth date, signature and licence number, is identical.\n\nThe Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) states on its website that \u201cheadwear worn for religious or medical reasons can be worn, but must not cover any part of your face.\u201d Individuals can also be asked to remove their glasses for the photo.\n\n\u201cMTO requires all drivers to show their entire face when being photographed for the Ontario driver\u2019s licence,\u201d Bob Nichols, spokesperson for the MTO, told AFP in an email.\n\nHe added that \u201cfemale applicants who traditionally wear a veil are allowed to unveil in privacy and to be photographed by a female operator.\u201d\n\nThe photo first appeared on social media in 2015, according to fact-checking website Snopes. It resurfaced ahead of the October 21 federal election.", "lang": "en"}
