That has not been a feature of most previous estate-tax bills. In fact, President Trump\u2019s campaign plan would have repealed the estate tax but taxed capital gains accumulated at death.\n\nEstate taxes in some form have existed for centuries, even among the Romans, and the version today in the United States was enacted in 1916 to help fund World War I. Part of the rationale for the estate tax is to help capture revenue from huge gains in stock and bond investments that otherwise are never taxed unless they are sold. Over time, the estate tax has never raised a significant portion of federal tax revenue, generally less than 1 or 2 percent of the overall pie.\n\nAs Congress has nibbled away at the estate tax over the years, by raising the amount exempt from taxation and lowering the tax rate, its impact has frittered away. In 1977, 139,000 estates had to pay the tax. In 2000, it was 52,000. Now in 2017, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, only about 5,500 estates \u2014 out of nearly 3 million estates \u2014 would have to pay any taxes. About half of estates subject to the tax would pay an average tax of about 9 percent.\n\nMoreover, the value of the assets given to heirs would be set at the value at the time of death. Imagine a home that had been purchased for $250,000 but was now worth $1 million. The \u201cstepped-up basis\u201d would be $1 million. If the heirs sold the house for $1.1 million, they would only owe capital-gains tax on the $100,000 difference, not the $850,000 difference from the original purchase price. (That is known as \u201ccarryover basis\u201d in the tax trade.)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s campaign tax plan issued in 2016 would have kept this arrangement. The first $10 million of an estate would be exempt from taxation, but then the capital gains tax would be levied on the rest. The maximum capital-gains tax rate is currently 23.8 percent, and it would have applied to the original price \u2014 the basis \u2014 of the asset.\n\n\u201cWe always said we\u2019d get rid of stepped-up basis. It\u2019s better for the economy and better for tax policy,\u201d said Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation, who helped craft the Trump campaign plan. \u201cOtherwise you will have a massive tax shelter. You are going to have people with an incentive not to sell.\u201d\n\nThe amount of revenue involved is difficult to estimate, but we have some clues. The Joint Committee on Taxation, in its report on \u201ctax expenditures,\u201d estimates that the revenue loss of not taxing capital gains at death is $179.4 billion over a five-year period, or about $36 billion a year. That estimate does not include the behavioral effects of actually eliminating the estate tax while keeping stepped-up basis, but it is a rough approximation before any possible exemption.\n\n\u201cThe estate tax functions as a toll that must be paid to shield capital gains from income taxation,\u201d noted the CJT in a 2012 report. \u201cAs this toll falls (i.e., the estate tax rate is reduced and/or the estate tax exemption amount increases), it is relatively more attractive to pay the estate tax to avoid the income tax on capital gains realizations. Similarly, as capital gains taxes rise (fall), paying the estate tax toll becomes more (less) attractive because the step-up in gains at death is more (less) valuable. High estate tax rates make the transmission of wealth to heirs less efficient and so encourage the realization of capital gains.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s interesting that House tax-writers would press forward with an elimination of the estate tax that goes far beyond previous efforts \u2014 or even Trump\u2019s campaign tax plan \u2014 to allow tens of billions of untapped capital gains to remain beyond the reach of the U.S. government. The money left on the table because of a difference between two words \u2014 \u201cstepped-up\u201d and \u201ccarryover\u201d \u2014 is certainly staggering.", "lang": "en"}
