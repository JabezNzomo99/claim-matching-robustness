They vote for politicians who lobby for illegal intruders \u2013 European Times).\u201d This statement, attributed to \u2018European Times\u2019, is widely circulated on social media with an image of President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nThe image has a logo \u2018BJP 4 All\u2019 and the post seems to have first appeared on a Facebook page by the same name. This was on October 28 and the claim has drawn over 500 shares since. The post has been circulated by other pages and several individual users recently.\n\nA similar claim floating on Facebook adds the word \u2018Rohingya\u2019 to the post, suggesting that \u2018European Times\u2019 termed Indian voters the most foolish in the world because they vote for politicians lobbying for \u2018illegal Rohingya intruders\u2019.\n\nAlt News found that the claim is manufactured. There is no media outlet called \u2018European Times.\u2019 However, there is a similarly named magazine \u2013 The European Times. We searched for multiple keywords on Google \u2013 India/Indian voters, illegal intruders/migrants \u2013 using the syntax site:european-times.com, but did not find any related report on the magazine.\n\nMoreover, reverse searching the image of EC President Jean-Claude Juncker reveals that the photograph was taken on August 30, 2018 by Reuters photojournalist Aris Oikonomou. It was clicked during the annual seminar of the European Commission College in Genval.\n\nSince the conclusion of the recent assembly elections, a new trend of misinformation is noticeable. The example above tries to blame voters by questioning their intellect. Earlier, a false report attributed to New York Timesclaimed that the publication praised PM Modi. In several other instances, we observed that false narratives of riots and Pakistani flags being raised post BJP\u2019s loss in the recent state assembly elections.", "lang": "en"}
