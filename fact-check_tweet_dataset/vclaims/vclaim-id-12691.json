The Public-Private Partnership project was previously called the Southwest Integrated Terminal Exchange.\n\nBidding for the project opened in January 2014, which MWM Terminals Inc. won a year later.\n\nIn a statement on its official Facebook page a day after the PITX\u2019s inauguration, the Department of Transportation said the project did not begin under Duterte:\n\nThe DOTr added that construction began on Oct. 21, 2016 and ended last April 17.\n\nDuterte\u2019s P9 trillion Build, Build, Build program fast-tracks the approval and implementation of 75 priority infrastructure projects intended to \u201cboost economic growth,\u201d according to the National Economic Development Authority.\n\nSeveral projects under Build Build Build predate Duterte\u2019s term. These include the expansion of the Mactan-Cebu International Airport, which began in 2010 also under Aquino, and the development of the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway conceived in 1996 during former President Fidel V. Ramos\u2019 term.\n\nSonza\u2019s false post could have reached more than 1.3 million people. Traffic to the story from social media largely came from the pages Duterte Today, DuterteSerye, and BONGBONG MARCOS: CYBER SQUAD.\n\nppp.gov.ph, \u201cDuterte \u2018impressed\u2019 with first \u2018landport\u2019 in PH,\u201d Nov. 5, 2018.", "lang": "en"}
