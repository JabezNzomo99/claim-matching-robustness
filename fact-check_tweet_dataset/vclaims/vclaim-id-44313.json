The video clearly shows that the man was seized as soon as he fired a shot.\n\nFurther, police are mandated to follow standard protocols when dealing with an active shooter.\n\nIn the face of a man holding a weapon at a crowded place like a university, it becomes all the more necessary to follow these protocols precisely. This would ensure that the situation doesn't get out of hand, and the shooter does not get agitated.\n\nPolice officers responding to an active shooter are trained in a procedure known as Rapid Deployment and are supposed to proceed immediately to the area in which shots were last heard; their purpose is to stop the shooting as quickly as possible.\n\nThe first responding officers will normally be in teams of four (4); they may be dressed in regular patrol uniforms, or they may be wearing external bulletproof vests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment. The officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, or handguns, and might also be using pepper spray or tear gas to control the situation.\n\nThere's nothing safe about a single officer running to confront a potential murderer or a terrorist.\n\nA terrorist is defined as a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.\n\nTherefore, the man with the gun, Ram Bhakt Gopal, is an alleged terrorist and police followed the necessary protocol.\n\nAlso Read: Breaking: \"Main Doonga Azaadi,\" Man Opens Fire At Protesters Near Jamia In Delhi", "lang": "en"}
