(This is roughly Europe\u2019s total population.) The 68 million figure for the UK is correct.\n\nConfirmed Covid-19 deaths are more difficult to compare between countries, which often record them differently, with different degrees of accuracy and delay. There are also several different data sources that this post\u2019s creator might have used.\n\nBy our reckoning, using data from the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford, a total of 33,602 Covid-19 deaths had been recorded in the 43 European countries listed on May 26, when the post appeared. This is slightly lower than the 34,500 figure quoted in the post. A discrepancy like this might simply be the result of using different data sources.\n\nOur World in Data records 36,914 Covid-19 deaths for the UK on 26 May, which is essentially the same as the 37,000 quoted in the post. This is the highest for any European country at the time, including those not featured in the post.\n\nThe 43 countries and territories that appear to be represented and compared with the UK are: Germany, Sweden, Portugal, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece, Bulgaria, Norway, Czechia, Ireland, Romania, Austria, Liechtenstein, Gibraltar, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Russia, Croatia, Belarus, Guernsey, Ukraine, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Andorra, Luxembourg, Moldova, San Marino, Albania, Isle of Man, Latvia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Monaco, Serbia, Switzerland, Malta and Vatican City.\n\nThis list does not include all European countries. Comparing it with Our World in Data\u2019s list of European countries and territories, it omits: Belgium, Cyprus, France, Italy, Jersey, Kosovo and Spain.\n\nAfter the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Belgium had the highest confirmed Covid-19 death tolls on 26 May. Including any of them in the \u2018Europe\u2019 group would have given it a higher combined death total than the UK\u2019s.\n\nWas the UK hit worse than any other European country?\n\nThe UK had experienced the most Covid-19 deaths in Europe by 26 May, but as the post suggests, we can\u2019t compare the severity of outbreaks by total deaths alone, because countries with smaller populations are always likely to experience fewer deaths. Instead we could consider the number of deaths that have occurred per million people, to give a sense of how badly each country has been affected, in terms of its size.\n\nBy this measure, on 26 May, the UK was the joint-fifth worst affected country on Our World in Data\u2019s European list, along with Italy, each having recorded 544 Covid-19 deaths per million people.\n\nThe worst affected was San Marino, with 1,238 deaths per million, then Belgium (803), Andorra (660) and Spain (580). (It\u2019s important to consider that the total number of deaths in very small countries like San Marino and Andorra are also very small, at 42 and 51 respectively. This means that it takes just a handful of cases to make the national death rate very high.)\n\nThe total European death rate on 26 May was 225 deaths per million people.\n\nWhat about now?\n\nAt the time of writing, using figures from 22 June, the UK still has the highest confirmed number of Covid-19 deaths in Europe. It now has the fourth highest death rate, with 628 deaths per million people.\n\nSan Marino still has the highest rate (1,238), followed by Belgium (837) and Andorra (673).\n\nThe total European death rate as of 22 June was 250 deaths per million people.", "lang": "en"}
