Her conclusion: \u201cJohn Miller\u201d is Trump.\n\n\u201cSame person,\u201d said Rita Singh, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon, who compared the 1991 phone interview of \u201cJohn Miller\u201d to a TV interview with Donald Trump by CBS\u2019 Connie Chung. \u201cSeveral micro-sections of his voice in the John Miller tape match the corresponding micro-sections in his Connie Chung interview from 1990.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post published a recording of a 1991 People magazine interview with \u201cJohn Miller\u201d in a May 13 article that ran under the headline \u201cDonald Trump masqueraded as publicist to brag about himself.\u201d The Post claimed Trump conducted interviews in the 1980s and \u201990s while posing as \u201cJohn Miller\u201d or \u201cJohn Barron\u201d \u2014 \u201cpublic-relations men who sound precisely like Trump himself \u2014 who indeed are Trump, masquerading as an unusually helpful and boastful advocate for himself, according to the journalists and several of Trump\u2019s top aides.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the reporter who conducted the People interview says Trump later admitted as much to her at the time, saying it was \u201ca joke that went awry.\u201d The reporter, Sue Carswell, reported the ruse in a July 1991 People story that ran under the headline \u201cTrump Says Goodbye Marla, Hello Carla: And a mysterious PR man who sounds just like Donald calls to spread the story.\u201d\n\nYou can read a transcript of the phone conversation here.\n\nBut when Trump was confronted about the 25-year-old recording on the \u201cToday\u201d show on May 13, Trump flatly denied that it was him.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me about it for the first time and it doesn\u2019t sound like my voice at all. I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice and you can imagine that. This sounds like one of these scams, one of the many scams. It doesn\u2019t sound like me.\u201d\n\nTrump was asked if he regularly posed as his own PR man for phone interviews, as the Post alleged.\n\n\u201cNo, and it was not me on the phone,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was not me on the phone. And it doesn\u2019t sound like me on the phone, I will tell you that. And it was not me on the phone.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel, host of ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d also raised the issue of the recording during an interview on May 25.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like me, though, really,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou think that sounded like me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kimmel said emphatically, to laughter, and later added, \u201cIf it was you, I think it was a very funny thing to do, to call a guy and take him through the ringer like that.\u201d\n\nTrump admitted that he sometimes has used aliases when purchasing real estate, explaining that if he used his real name, \u201cyou had to pay more money for the land.\u201d Trump said one of the names he used was \u201cJohn Barron.\u201d Using aliases in the real estate business is common, Trump said, to prevent sellers from inflating the asking price.\n\nIndeed, it is well-documented that Walt Disney used fake names to buy up land in Florida that would become Walt Disney World.\n\nWe don\u2019t take any position on Trump\u2019s use of an alias, but the fact is that he denied using one while being interviewed by People magazine in 1991 even though there is evidence that it was indeed him.\n\nWe asked Rita Singh, a speech scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, to analyze the voice on the tape. She then compared it to a recording of an interview of Trump with Connie Chung in 1990.\n\nSingh is part of a team at Carnegie Mellon using a cutting-edge voice profiling technique called micro-articulometry. At various conferences this year, Singh unveiled a series of peer-reviewed papers: two in Cyprus in March; one in Croatia in May; and one at the 2016 IEEE International Symposium on Technologies for Homeland Security in Waltham, Massachusetts, in May.\n\n\n\nBut the short version is this: Speech is produced when air from the lungs passes through the vocal tract. Different speech sounds are produced by controlling the airflow, vibration of the vocal folds, and the position of articulators like the jaw, tongue and lips, Singh explained. As we speak, sounds follow one another rapidly. In going from one sound to the next, the size, shape and agility of all of these elements come into play.\n\nFor example, when a sound that does not require the vocal folds to vibrate is followed by a sound that does, there is a time lag (of the order of milliseconds) between the two states. \u201cMuch like the pickup on your car when you hit the accelerator,\u201d Singh said.\n\nHere\u2019s how it is explained in a paper written by Singh and Eduard Hovy, both of Carnegie Mellon, and Joseph Keshet of Bar Ilan University in Israel: \u201cThe term articulometry itself conventionally refers to the measurement of the movements, dimensions and positions of the articulators in the human vocal tract during the process of speech production.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is very characteristic of people,\u201d said Singh, who for two years has been working with federal investigators at Homeland Security on voice-based crimes, such as hoax callers reporting fake threats.\n\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon fragment speech into tiny sections, on the order of fractions of a second. From these they measure many different micro-scale properties of sounds and of transitions between sounds. Singh likened these micro-properties to bar codes. \u201cAnd if those bar codes match,\u201d she said, \u201cthere is a very high probability that it\u2019s the same person.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how much you try to change or disguise your voice, many things about your voice are out of your voluntary control, you cannot change them,\u201d Singh said. And so, \u201cmatching these helps us determine if someone is impersonating a speaker or not.\u201d\n\nComparing on a micro level the speech of \u201cJohn Miller\u201d to that of Trump in the Connie Chung interview showed four matching micro properties. That\u2019s enough to convince Singh it was Trump in both interviews.\n\nJames Baker, who founded Dragon Systems, a pioneer in speech recognition technology, said Singh\u2019s technique is \u201cscientifically valid\u201d and her work is performed with proper scientific method.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely it is a quality scientific technique,\u201d Baker said.\n\nBaker said he too heard the tape of \u201cJohn Miller\u201d and based on voice quality and his 50 years of experience in the speech recognition field, he was convinced it was Trump as well.\n\n\u201cCould you find someone to imitate his voice good enough to fool me? Yes,\u201d Baker said. But you\u2019d have to then assume the alleged PR person was trying to imitate Trump, and, he noted, \u201cNo one\u2019s saying that it\u2019s someone trying to be Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nSingh, using her advanced computer-enhanced techniques, would be able to analyze that much more reliably, he said. \u201c[Singh\u2019s] work is absolutely very solid for that,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, he said, no current technology can be certified as 100 percent reliable. The probability of her being wrong is not absolute zero, he said, but \u201cinformally\u201d he believes it is less than 1 percent.\n\nSingh has worked in the field of speech and audio processing for 18 years, and has been at Carnegie Mellon since 2009. In the early 2000s, she worked for three years as a visiting scientist in the Spoken Language Systems Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in 2007 was the first employee of the Human Language Technology Center of Excellence at Johns Hopkins University. She is the associate editor of the IEEE Signal Processing Letters, a monthly publication \u201cdesigned to provide rapid dissemination of original, cutting-edge ideas and timely, significant contributions in signal, image, speech, language and audio processing.\u201d\n\nSingh herself cautioned that audio signal processing has not been perfected yet and that the scientific confidence level is not fully 100 percent. But the data and her experience leave no doubt.\n\n\u201cI am convinced it is the same person,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind about it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
