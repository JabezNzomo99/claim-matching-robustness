It was a nonanswer.\n\nFox News contributor Ari Fleischer, who worked for President George W. Bush as White House press secretary, called attention on Twitter to a testy exchange between Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas.\n\n\"Rep. Ratcliffe just asked the most important question of the day: Was there anything in President Trump's July 25th phone call that was impeachable,\" Fleischer tweeted. \"Neither witness said yes.\"\n\nSince Fleischer and others \u2014 including President Donald Trump \u2014 have tweeted about the back-and-forth, we decided to revisit the moment in question, which came toward the end of Ratcliffe\u2019s allotted speaking time, and see what was said.\n\nTaylor said impeachment wasn\u2019t for him to decide\n\nThe exchange came after Ratcliffe asked about Trump\u2019s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, a readout of which was released by the White House in September.\n\n\"So, in this impeachment hearing today, where we impeach presidents for treason or bribery or other high crimes, where is the impeachable offense in that call?\" Ratcliffe asked. \"Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call?\"\n\nAfter roughly five seconds, Taylor started to respond. But Ratcliffe interrupted and, shouting over Taylor, withdrew the question before Taylor could finish. Taylor became visibly agitated.\n\nAmid the crosstalk, Taylor said, \"I\u2019m not here to take one side or the other, that\u2019s your decision.\"\n\nAt that point, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., offered to suspend the clock so Taylor could respond to the question without running out the rest of Ratcliffe\u2019s time.\n\n\"I would just like to say that I\u2019m not here to do anything having to do with the \u2026 to decide about impeachment,\" Taylor said. \"That is not what either of us are here to do. This is your job.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a different answer than the one suggested in Fleischer\u2019s tweet, which characterized Taylor\u2019s response as being telling in the same way that an affirmative \"no\" might have been. In reality, Taylor opted to pass on the question, saying it wasn\u2019t his role to give a straight answer.\n\nThe job belongs to Congress, he said. Kent never addressed the question himself.\n\nIn an email to PolitiFact, Fleischer said both Taylor and Kent were \"direct and to the point\" in response to other questions and that \"their failure to answer in the affirmative spoke volumes.\"\n\n\"They were not shy about providing their judgment for other questions, yet they notably did not say yes on Ratcliffe\u2019s question,\" Fleischer told us. \"They easily could have leaned in to answer the obvious question about impeachment. They did not say yes.\"\n\nAn attorney for Taylor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
