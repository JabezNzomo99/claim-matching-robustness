Two days after the election, she was selected by her peers to serve as minority floor leader.\n\nQuade spoke with reporters after the selection. She said she \"read an article that we had the largest amount of millennial Democrats running than any other state in the country.\"\n\nBecause she has taken over an important leadership role in the Missouri House, we decided to check out her claim to see if Missouri really did have more millennial Democrats run for state legislature positions than any other state.\n\nWhen we reached out to Quade, she pointed us to a Facebook post and an article from the progressive PAC Run for Something, whose mission is to support millennial Democrats running for state legislature.\n\nThe article links to a study conducted by Run for Something and the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which looks into the number of millennials running for state offices across the United States.\n\nThe Pew Research Center currently defines millennials as those aged 22 to 37 this year. But it acknowledges that many others \"have offered well-reasoned arguments for drawing that line a few years earlier or later than where we have.\" \u201cAmerica has 133 million registered voters,\u201d but \u201c159 million votes\u201d were cast in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAccording to the data, Missouri had 31 millennial Democrats run for state office, of which 12 would go on to win their elections.\n\nMissouri barely edged out Pennsylvania, which had 30, while Nevada and Wyoming had the least, with two millennial Democrats running for office in each state.\n\nMorley Winograd, a millennial politics expert and senior fellow at the University of Southern California, said the reason that there was such large variance in the number of Democrat millennials running in some states over others was likely caused \"by the issues being debated in those state legislatures and the organizing motivation it provided for recruiting candidates of this type in those states.\"\n\nQuade said that she \"read an article that we had the largest amount of millennial Democrats running than any other state in the country.\"\n\nQuade referenced an October study from the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee and the group Run For Something. While the study excluded four states, it found that Missouri had the most millennial Democrats run for office, and we didn\u2019t find any data or expert opinion to the contrary of their numbers.", "lang": "en"}
