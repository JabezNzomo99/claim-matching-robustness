The users are asked to avail themselves of the offer by clicking on the link given in that message. The same message (archived) is also being shared on Facebook. Let\u2019s check to what extent it is true.\n\n\n\nClaim: \u2018Honda\u2019 is giving away 372 free \u2018Activa 5G\u2019 Scooters on the eve of the company\u2019s 72nd Anniversary. Fact: \u2018Honda\u2019 company is not giving any free scooters. The message is just a giveaway \u2018scam\u2019. So, those who participate in the scheme by clicking the link will not get any free scooter. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe message says that \u2018Honda\u2019 is giving away 372 free \u2018Activa 5G\u2019 Scooters on the eve of the company\u2019s 72nd Anniversary and the scooter can be obtained by clicking on the link \u2018activa.specialoffer.xyz\u2019.\n\nHints that the message is just a \u2018scam\u2019:\n\u2022 The official website address of Honda two-wheelers in India is \u2018https://www.honda2wheelersindia.com/\u2019, but the URL in the post is different.\n\u2022 No matter how many times the URL (activa.specialoffer.xyz) is opened, it always displays the number of remaining scooters as 265.\n\u2022 When you answer three simple questions, the text congratulating that the user has won a free Honda Activa 5G Scooter and that he/she has to share the message with 20 contacts so as to get the scooter delivered in two days is displayed. This is generally the way, the fake website works\n\nAlso, it can be found that a similar message \u2013 \u2018300 Free Honda Activa 5G Scooters to celebrate DIWALI\u2019 went viral in October 2019.\n\nTo conclude, the news that \u2018Honda\u2019 is giving away 372 free \u2018Activa 5G\u2019 Scooters on its 72nd Anniversary is fake.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
