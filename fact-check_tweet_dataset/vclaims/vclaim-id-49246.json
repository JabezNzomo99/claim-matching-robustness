She told the Daily Caller the women pictured in the left and lower-right photos are not her.\n\nKarlan, a professor of public interest law and the co-director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at Stanford Law School, testified at the House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing Dec. 4. She and three other law school professors appeared before the committee to discuss the constitutional grounds for impeaching President Donald Trump, according to Roll Call.\n\nThe Facebook post features two different photographs of women wearing pro-feminist clothing: one wearing a pink crocheted \u201cpussy hat\u201d and one wearing a \u201cvagina lady\u201d costume. It claims those photos, as well as a third depicting a woman taking a legal oath, show Karlan.\n\n\u201cThis was the democrats constitutional \u2018expert\u2019 impeachment witness, Stanford law professor Pamela Karlen (sic),\u201d reads the caption.\n\nWhile the upper-right image does show Karlan being sworn in before her Dec. 4 testimony, there\u2019s no evidence that the women in the pictures on the lower-right and left are the Stanford law professor. (Do These Images Show The Ukraine Whistleblower Posing With Democrats?)\n\nA reverse image search revealed that the photo on the left depicts a protestor at the January 2017 Women\u2019s March in Washington, D.C. The photo, taken by Agence France-Presse photographer Robyn Beck, appeared in numerous media reports about the event; however, none identified the woman wearing the pink crocheted hat as Karlan.\n\nThe lower-right photo, also found through a reverse image search, doesn\u2019t identify Karlan as the woman wearing a costume and carrying a \u201cvagina lady\u201d sign either. It comes from a Flickr album of pictures from the 2007 Bay to Breakers footrace held in San Francisco every year.\n\n\u201cI attended neither event,\u201d Karlan told the Caller in an email. \u201cI appear in neither picture.\u201d\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee voted Dec. 13 to send two articles of impeachment before the entire House, according to ABC News. The House is expected to vote on those articles this week.", "lang": "en"}
