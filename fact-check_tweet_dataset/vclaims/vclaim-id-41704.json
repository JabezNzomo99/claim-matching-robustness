This false rumor is entirely based on incorrect assumptions made from looking at a single screenshot posted by Twitter user J.L. Hamilton. The image of the Google Play store (see below) showed a \u201cLarry King Live\u201d episode for Aug. 10 and Aug. 12, 1993, but not Aug. 11. In a tweet that was later deleted, Hamilton accused CNN of \u201cactively colluding with the Biden Campaign to cover up evidence of Biden\u2019s sexual assault.\u201d\n\nThe above-displayed screenshot is genuine. If you go to the Google Play store, you will not find an episode of \u201cLarry King Live\u201d listed for Aug. 11, 1993. However, the claim that CNN removed the episode quickly falls apart when we take a look at the available information.\n\n\u2018Larry King Live\u2019 Episodes Are Not Currently Available To Stream on Google Play\n\nSome of the confusion may stem from the fact that Google Play lists shows and episodes on its website that aren\u2019t actually available for viewing there. While Google Play lists hundreds of \u201cLarry King Live\u201d episodes, for instance, these episodes are not available to view on the service, but users can add them to their \u201cwatch list.\u201d A Google spokesperson told us that Google does this to gauge viewer interest.\n\nAs of this writing, if you click on any episode of \u201cLarry King Live\u201d you will be greeted with the text: \u201cThis show is currently unavailable.\u201d This, of course, raises the question: Why would CNN remove an episode from a service where it was already unavailable for viewing?\n\nFurthermore, although Google Play provides a list of episodes, they do not provide a description for each individual episode. The store instead provides a brief biography of Larry King and a short summary of the \u201cLarry King Live\u201d show. In other words, even if this episode had been listed, it would have made no mention of Tara Reade, which, again, would give CNN little incentive (if, that is, the unfounded notion that CNN was \u201crunning cover\u201d for Biden was accurate) to remove the episode.\n\nShortly after this rumor went viral, Matt Dornic, head of CNN Communications, took to Twitter to state that \u201cCNN did not remove anything,\u201d that the network did not have a distribution deal for \u201cLarry King Live\u201d with Google Play, and that Google did not source its listing through CNN:\n\nA Segment from This Episode Was Broadcast by CNN in April 2020\n\nThe rumor that CNN was \u201crunning cover\u201d for the Biden campaign is undercut by the fact that CNN drew attention to this episode during an April 25, 2020 segment. In the accompanying article, CNN wrote:\n\n(CNN)Newly surfaced video from 1993 appears to feature the mother of Tara Reade, a woman who accused presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden of sexual assault, calling into a cable TV show to seek advice around the time of the alleged assault. In a \u201cLarry King Live\u201d segment that aired on August 11, 1993, on CNN, an unnamed woman calls in to the show with her location identified on the screen as San Luis Obispo, California. The show was about the cutthroat nature of Washington, DC, politics and media. \u201cYes, hello. I\u2019m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington?\u201d she asks. \u201cMy daughter has just left there after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.\u201d\n\nGoogle Play\u2019s Listing of \u2018Larry King Live\u2019 Episodes Is Not Comprehensive\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear exactly how Google populates its list of \u201cLarry King Live\u201d episodes, but the list is not comprehensive. For instance, the first episode of \u201cLarry King Live\u201d aired on CNN back in 1985. The earliest episode listed on Google Play, however, is from 1987 (and features Donald Trump).\n\nWe have yet to see any evidence that an Aug. 11, 1993, episode of \u201cLarry King Live\u201d was ever listed on Google Play. Since Google Play\u2019s \u201cLarry King Live\u201d catalog is missing several episodes, it\u2019s possible that no episode for this date was ever listed on (and therefore never removed from) Google\u2019s streaming service.", "lang": "en"}
