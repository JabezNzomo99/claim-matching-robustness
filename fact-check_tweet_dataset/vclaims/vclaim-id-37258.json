And he\u2019s taken leave from his job as an ironworker, collecting more than $6 million in campaign contributions along the way.\n\nBut what about another Democrat running for the House \u2014 wealthy Dan Kohl, the nephew of multimillionaire and former 24-year U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl? He is seeking the east-central Wisconsin seat held by Republican Glenn Grothman.\n\nIn not one, not two, but three TV ads released Sept. 4, 2018, Dan Kohl declares: \"I'm not a politician.\"\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee actually said in ripping one of the ads that Kohl is correct in saying he\u2019s not a politician. But the group, which works to elect Republicans to the House, also cited to us evidence that he is a politician.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look.\n\nAs we noted in our Bryce fact check, dictionaries aren\u2019t much help, given how widely the definitions of politician vary:\n\nBut the more, and more deeply, involved you become in politics, the closer you are to being a politician.\n\nKohl has never held office, and has run only once before. So, that differentiates him from Bryce.\n\nBut Kohl has been involved in politics, in a more behind-the-scenes way.\n\nHere\u2019s more detail on Kohl\u2019s professional life after he earned a law degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1992, based on information from his campaign website; the business networking site LinkedIn; Vote Smart, a website that backgrounds candidates and elected officials; and news accounts:\n\nIn a strict sense, he\u2019s not, given that he\u2019s never held public office and this is only his second run in the past 10 years.\n\nBut Kohl also spent a total of eight years as a Washington, D.C., lobbyist and senior member of a Washington-based advocacy group, in addition to being a major fundraiser for presidential candidates.", "lang": "en"}
