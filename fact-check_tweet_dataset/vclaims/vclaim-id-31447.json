Ukrainians were evacuated on Feb. 18.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "February 20, 2020", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-31447", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-attacks-ukraine-for-delay-in-wuhan-coronavirus-evacuation/30446037.html", "vclaim": "On Feb. 13, Olga Skabeyeva and her husband Evgeny Popov, who co-hosts the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d program on state-owned Rossiya-1 TV, interviewed Ekaterina Bondareva, a Ukrainian citizen who was awaiting evacuation from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated.\n\nBondareva told the interviewers: \u201cWe were told that we were being evacuated on the 11th. But unfortunately, eight hours later, in the morning, our country sent a message to the group that we can\u2019t evacuate you \u2018for technical reasons\u2019. We are all shocked, because we were all packed and ready to go ... We are asking everyone for help. Please hear us. I'd like to go home...\u201c\n\nAsked about the Ukrainian Embassy in China\u2019s response to the crisis, Bondareva said the embassy had \u201cdone all it could to provide for the evacuation,\u201d including organizing buses to transport the evacuees and providing material support. Bondareva said the problem wasn\u2019t with the embassy, but with the Ukrainian government.\n\nOlga Skabeyeva ended the segment by condemning the Ukrainian government.\n\n\u201cShame on the Ukrainian government,\u201d Skabeyeva said. \u201cShame! They (the Ukrainian government) need to get their people. Need to give maximum effort.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 18, five days after the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d program aired, Ukraine evacuated its 45 Ukrainian citizens from Wuhan, along with 27 foreign citizens, mostly from Argentina. Photos taken at the airport and posted on the Ukrainian Embassy in China\u2019s website showed passengers holding the flags of Panama, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe evidence is ambiguous about whether the Ukrainians ever promised an evacuation earlier, although it is clear that the government was working on it, based on the information provided by the Ukrainian embassy in China, as well as the statements and actions of Ukrainian officials at the time.\n\nAt least part of the delay may have been to ensure that evacuations wouldn\u2019t spread the virus. In order to judge Ukrainian officials\u2019 response, it is important to review the chronology of events starting on Feb. 10, when the Ukrainian embassy announced evacuation plans, through Feb. 18, when it took place.\n\nOn Feb. 10, the Ukrainian Embassy in China\u2019s website had posted plans to evacuate Ukrainian citizens from Hubei province (whose capital city is Wuhan) along with instructions for evacuees. The post gave no date or time for the evacuation, saying that would be announced later.\n\nAn article published Feb. 12 on the Ukrainian Russian-language site Today mentioned the Ukrainian Embassy in China\u2019s web posting and claimed the embassy had named Feb. 11 as the evacuation date -- as Bondareva told her Russian interviewers. The Today article reported that the Feb. 11 date later \u201cdisappeared\u201d from the embassy\u2019s site.\n\nAn article published by the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN on Feb. 10 said Feb. 11 would be \u201cthe most optimistic scenario\u201d for evacuation. UNIAN noted that arrangements were under way between the Ukrainian embassy and the Chinese.\n\nOn Feb. 12, Today quoted Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, as saying: \"As soon as we are 100% sure that the evacuation does not carry the risk of spreading this infection on the territory of Ukraine, we will literally immediately carry out all necessary evacuation actions. This is a matter of days.\"\n\nOn Feb. 14, the same outlet reported that Honcharuk had announced Feb. 18 as the planned evacuation date.\n\nOn Feb. 18, the day of the evacuation (scheduled to arrive in Kyiv on Feb. 19), Today published an article quoting Bondareva. She did not repeat the complaints she made on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Instead, she spoke about having to pass medical screenings before the flight and noted that Wuhan authorities had forbidden residents to leave home or drive.\n\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan. To date, more than 2,000 people have died from the disease.\n\nRussian state media, particularly Skabeyeva and Popov\u2019s talk show \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d have a well-established history of maligning the Ukrainian government. In October 2019, Polygraph.info fact-checked Skabeyeva herself, who had claimed that such disparagement had \u201cnever been done on purpose.\u201d Polygraph.info found that claim to be false.\n\nDespite the evacuation, hysteria over the coronavirus continues to plague Ukraine. On Feb. 20, protesters in Novy Sanzhary attempted to block the buses carrying the evacuees to the local sanitarium, where they are to be quarantined for 14 days.", "lang": "en"}
