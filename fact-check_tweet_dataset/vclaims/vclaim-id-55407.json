A picture of this costume of mine was the number one googled image, for two weeks in a row, after Halloween, that year. Totally set a new standard of how I approached any costume or FX creation of mine. It took several of my friends to help me accomplish this costume I had a lot of support...Especially I want to thank all of the photographers that took the time to photograph me.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
