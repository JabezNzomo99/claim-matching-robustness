In the post, it is being questioned how the government could provide treatment for one crore COVID-19 patients if the number of patients was less than 2 lakhs in the country. Let\u2019s fact check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that free treatment was provided to one crore COVID-19 patients in India. Fact: In his \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019 programme, Modi has said that the beneficiaries of \u2018Ayushman Bharat\u2019 scheme crossed over one crore. He did not say that the government has treated one crore COVID-19 patients. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched about the claim made in the post, it was found that no such comments were made by Modi. It was found that Modi, in his \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019 programme, has praised the efforts of the government in combating the pandemic and took pride in sharing that the beneficiaries of \u2018Ayushman Bharat\u2019 crossed over one crore. The statements made by PM Modi in his \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019 programme regarding 1 crore Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries can be heard in this video at 18:03 sec. The same can be read in the transcript of his speech on the \u2018PM INDIA\u2019 website and in the tweet of \u2018PMO India\u2019.\n\nAlso, the \u2018India TV Hindi\u2019 has issued a correction regarding their mistake during the telecast\n\nTo sum it up, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not said that his government provided treatment for one crore COVID-19 patients.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
