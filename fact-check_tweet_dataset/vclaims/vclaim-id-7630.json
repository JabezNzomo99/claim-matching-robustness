{"title": "HMRC: how many unanswered calls?", "subtitle": "Around 13% of calls to HMRC have gone unanswered in the eleven months from April 2017, compared to 8% in the same months the year before.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-7630", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/hmrc-unanswered-calls/", "vclaim": "Between April 2017 and February 2018, around 13% of calls to an HMRC adviser went unanswered, that\u2019s around 5.6 million calls.\n\nThere were around 4 million unanswered calls across the whole year in 2016/17.\n\nAround 15% of calls that were answered between April 2017 and February 2018 took more than ten minutes to be picked up.\n\nHMRC\u2019s performance figures are currently worse than for the year 2016/17 (although data for the last month of 2017/18 isn\u2019t available yet). That said, it is meeting its targets in terms of average response time to a call, and the level of calls answered in under ten minutes.\n\n13% of calls to an HMRC adviser weren\u2019t answered in 2017/18\n\n13% of calls made by the general public to HMRC weren\u2019t answered between April 2017 and February 2018.\n\nIn total there were 43 million calls to HMRC from the public between April 2017 and February 2018. 13% of these calls would total around 5.6 million unanswered calls.\n\nHMRC has an automated phone system which directs customers to the correct department and can answer some questions\u2014if this doesn\u2019t help the customer they can then speak to an adviser.\n\nSome calls ended in the automated system might be classed as not handled (or not answered) though most are classed as handled if the caller hangs up. If the caller receives a busy message and their call is disconnected while waiting to speak to an adviser or if there are technical difficulties and the call ends, that\u2019s also counted as not handled.\n\nThere were around four million unanswered calls in 2016/17 (around 8% of all calls), according to analysis of HMRC figures by the National Audit Office (NAO). That said, the NAO analysis says \u201cIndependent research commissioned by HMRC concluded that HMRC cannot assume that all customers have had their query resolved at the point a call ends, meaning HMRC could have resolved fewer queries than it has reported.\u201d\n\nA higher proportion of calls are answered now than several years ago, but performance has dipped this year\n\n13% is a higher level than the corresponding period in 2016/17, when 9% of calls went unanswered. Across the whole of 2016/17, 8% of calls went unanswered.\n\nIn February 2018 (the most recent month we have figures for), 10% of calls went unanswered. That compares to 6% in February 2017.\n\nPerformance has improved in the last two years though. In 2015/16, 28% of calls went unanswered, and in 2010/11 it was 52%.\n\nHMRC\u2019s target until 2015/16 was to answer 80% of calls. In 2016/17 this rose to 85%. We have not seen an explicit target for 2017/18.\n\n15% of answered calls took more than ten minutes to be picked up since April 2017\n\nBetween April 2017 and February 2018, just under 15% of calls that were answered took more than ten minutes to be picked up. In the month of February 2018 it was 12%, and 14% in January. We\u2019ve not found any comparable monthly figures covering 2016/17.\n\nHMRC\u2019s target is that no more than 15% of calls take over 10 minutes to be answered. They told us that their waiting time figures don\u2019t include any time spent in the automated system which directs customers to the right person, or answers their question.\n\nIn February 2018, the average call was answered after three minutes and 47 seconds. The average waiting time since April 2017 is around four and a half minutes. In 2016/17, the average was three minutes and 54 seconds. HMRC\u2019s target is for calls to be answered within five minutes.", "lang": "en"}
