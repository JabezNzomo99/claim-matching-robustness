Chris Coons claimed on Twitter that 61 percent of the overdose deaths in his state involved the drug fentanyl.\n\n\u201cIn DE, 61% of deaths related to overdoses involved fentanyl,\u201d reads the April 29 tweet.\n\nIn 2017, 345 people died from drug overdoses in Delaware, according to the state\u2019s Division of Forensic Science. Of these, 210 \u2013 or 61 percent \u2013 involved fentanyl. After Coons made the claim, numbers for 2018 were published that showed 74 percent of overdose deaths in the state involved fentanyl.\n\nIllicit fentanyl is an extremely potent synthetic opioid. Primarily sourced from China and Mexico, it has fueled the opioid crisis currently gripping the country.

Weeks earlier, the Chinese government announced that it would further regulate the manufacture of fentanyl.\n\nCoons\u2019 state of Delaware has been particularly hard hit by the drug crisis, recording one of the highest overdose rates in the country. The number of deaths, many of them opioid-related, has increased every year since at least 2015.\n\nIn 2017, there were 345 overdose deaths in Delaware, of which 210, or 61 percent, involved fentanyl, according to Delaware\u2019s Division of Forensic Science. There were 308 overdose deaths in 2016, of which 109 were fentanyl-related.\n\nFigures for 2018 were released after Coons made the claim, with 400 overdose deaths that year, 74 percent of which involved fentanyl.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also track yearly overdose deaths by state. Although its 2017 data does not specify how many overdose deaths involved fentanyl, it does show that 178 out of 338 overdose deaths, or 53 percent, involved some sort of synthetic opioid (excluding methadone), of which fentanyl is a subset.\n\n\u201cFentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin, and that really leads to these increased deaths that we\u2019re seeing because more fentanyl is coming into our state,\u201d Kara Odom Walker, secretary of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS), told WHYY. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge right now.\u201d\n\nThe death toll might have been worse if not for the work of paramedics and police officers who administered the overdose-reversing medication naloxone 2,714 times to 1,906 people in 2017.\n\nDelaware has taken a number of steps to address the crisis, including a statewide initiative to raise awareness regarding the addictive nature of opioids commonly prescribed by dentists and oral surgeons.\n\n\u201cHealth officials in Delaware understand that this is the public health crisis of our generation, with thousands of Delawareans and their families continuing to be impacted by this chronic brain disease,\u201d a DHSS spokesperson told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an email.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
