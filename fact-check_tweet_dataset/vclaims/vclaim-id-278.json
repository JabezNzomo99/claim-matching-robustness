The article is from a website called The Bernician, which appears to be a blogging platform for an individual who describes himself as a comedian. The article includes a disclaimer at the top stating that it is a \u201cre-post\u201d of an anonymous email the author has received (here).\n\nThe article makes various claims about the germination of a virus and its use to enforce \u201cpolice state style laws\u201d around the world in relation to COVID-19. These claims are outside the scope of this check, which will only focus on the headline claim that the coronavirus is not contagious.\n\nEchoing the sentiment from the headline captured in the screenshot, a user comments: \u201cIf it was \u2018contagious\u2019 we would have seen a real pandemic\u201d (here).\n\nIt is false for the headline to suggest that COVID-19 is not infectious.\n\nSteven Riley, a professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London, told Reuters that COVID-19 is \u201cdefinitely contagious\u201d, and said it was preferable to refer to it as being \u201cdirectly transmitted from person to person\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe virus can only reproduce in animal cells, and it dies pretty quickly outside the human body.\u201d\n\nRiley said the reproductive value or \u201cR number\u201d, which refers to the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus to, is a key factor in gauging the spread of the disease. \u201cWhen first transmitted in the UK in mid-February/early March, this was growing with three new infections to every one person infected,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, COVID-19 is transmitted between people through \u201csmall droplets from the nose or mouth\u201d that are expelled through coughs, sneezes or speech, and are inhaled by others.\n\nThe droplets can also land on surfaces, which, if touched and applied to a person\u2019s eyes, nose or mouth, can also cause an infection (here).\n\nThis transmissibility isn\u2019t exclusive to COVID-19 when discussing viruses, according to Riley. \u201c[Viruses] can\u2019t reproduce without a host cell,\u201d he said. \u201cA virus is basically a little capsule with [ribonucleic acid] RNA inside it [...] the capsule sticks onto the outside of the cell and manages to get ingested, where it releases the viral RNA. It then uses the cell\u2019s machinery to replicate itself.\u201d\n\nFalse. Coronavirus strains and other viruses are contagious and are transmitted from person to person.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
