Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The UN has recognised \u2018Jammu & Kashmir\u2019 as a separate country in the World map on its website \u2018www.un.org\u2019. Fact: The UN hasn\u2019t recognised \u2018Jammu & Kashmir\u2019 as a separate country. In the map, the UN mentioned that the dotted line represents approximately the Line of Control in Jammu & Kashmir agreed upon by India and Pakistan and that the final status of Jammu & Kashmir has not yet been agreed upon by the parties. Also, the name \u2018Jammu and Kashmir\u2019 is not completely in capital letters whereas the other countries names are in completely in capital letters. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWe visited the UN website (\u2018www.un.org\u2019) given in the post, the same World Map was found there. In the map, a dotted line is found in the \u2018Jammu & Kashmir\u2019 region and also an asterisk mark (*) over the name. In the map\u2019s legend, the below information about the asterisk mark (*) is given\u2013 \u2018Dotted line represents approximately the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir agreed upon by India and Pakistan. The final status of Jammu and Kashmir has not yet been agreed upon by the parties\u2019. Also, in the map, the name \u2018Jammu and Kashmir\u2019 is not in capital letters whereas the other countries names are in capital letters, indicating they are countries recognized by the UN.\n\nIn the map, a dotted line is also found between \u2018Sudan\u2019 and \u2018South Sudan\u2019. In the map\u2019s legend, it is given that the final boundary between the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan has not yet been determined.\n\nAlso, in the map\u2019s legend it is given that \u2013 \u2018The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations\u2019.\n\nIt indicates that dotted line is usually used in the UN Map when there is a boundary dispute.\n\nTo sum it up, the UN hasn\u2019t recognised \u2018Jammu & Kashmir\u2019 as a separate country in the World map on its website.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
