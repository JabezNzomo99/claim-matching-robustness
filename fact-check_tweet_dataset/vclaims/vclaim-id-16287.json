The OECD says it\u2019s about \u201dworking smarter\u201d, rather than \u201cworking harder\u201d.\n\nPeople think it can be improved by investment in things like infrastructure, education, management and technology. For example, you\u2019d be more productive if your boss bought you a faster computer, even if you put the same amount of effort into your job.\n\nThe Chancellor said that was why the government plans to borrow money to fund infrastructure and innovation.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no single answer on exactly how to solve the UK\u2019s \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d, as the Bank of England put it, or exactly why it exists. It\u2019s likely to be multiple factors at play. We\u2019ve talked some of these issues in the past.", "lang": "en"}
