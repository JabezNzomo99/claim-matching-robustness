CNN ranked No. 11 in prime time, which is from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nThe network did, however, make another Top 10 list for basic cable networks: It ranked No. 7 for total-day viewership (which measures viewing over 24 hours, from 6 a.m. to 6 a.m.). CNN averaged 706,000 total-day viewers in 2018, down 9 percent from 2017. Even Fox News, which ranked No. 1 in both prime-time and total-day viewers in 2018, saw a 5 percent drop in its average total-day viewership from the previous year.\n\nAmericanLookout.com included the prime-time rankings from the Adweek article, but omitted the part about total-day viewers, which clearly said \u201cCNN earned a strong No. 7 ranking.\u201d MSNBC, which gained viewers in both measurements from 2017 to 2018, ranked No. 2 for total-day viewers and No. 3 for prime time.\n\nFacebook users replying to the story on conservative pages called for CNN\u2019s demise, denouncing it as \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 a term popularized by President Donald Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Nielsen ratings have been cherry-picked to mislead readers about CNN. Last year, a website known for sharing deceptive content went so far as to falsely claim the network would \u201cpermanently close its doors\u201d due to a \u201cratings crisis.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network. Since 2015, FactCheck.org also has collaborated with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d to produce online fact-checking videos.\n\nKatz, A.J. \u201c2018 Year-End Cable Ranker: Fox News, MSNBC, Hallmark Channel Are Among Top Networks to Also Post Audience Growth.\u201d Adweek. 3 Jan 2019.\n\nLaChance, Mike. \u201cRATINGS DISASTER: CNN Doesn\u2019t Make Top 10 Of Most Watched Cable Networks In 2018.\u201d AmericanLookout.com. 3 Jan 2019.", "lang": "en"}
