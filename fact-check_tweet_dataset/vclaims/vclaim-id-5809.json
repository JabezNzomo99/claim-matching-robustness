Biden has in fact resisted demands from liberal activists to defund police departments, instead proposing a $300-million investment in policing, contingent on officers mirroring the diversity of their communities.\n\nViewed tens of thousands of times on Facebook, the ad can be found here , and here .\n\nThe video, called \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s America\u201d and paid for by America First Action, a political action committee (PAC) that promotes President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy agenda, begins with Biden saying \u201cYes, absolutely, yes,\u201d with the overlaid text \u201cDEFUND THE POLICE?\u201d. A mother and son call 911, only to hear an automated voice say \u201cYou have reached 911. Due to budget cuts and increased criminal activity, our agents are busy assisting other callers.\u201d As onscreen text reads \u201cPOLICE HAVE FEWER RESOURCES IN JOE BIDEN\u2019S AMERICA,\u201d the child says, \u201cMommy, I\u2019m scared,\u201d and an ominous figure lurks in the doorway.\n\nThe clip of Biden at the beginning of the video comes from an interview with progressive activist Ady Barkan published by NowThis News on Jul 11, 2020 ( here ). On the topic of police reform, Barkan asks Biden around the 2:57 mark, \u201cBut do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?\u201d and Biden answers \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d While similar, the question Biden is asked is not \u201cDefund the police?\u201d as the ad implies.\n\nNationwide protests against police brutality and white supremacy following the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd on May 25, 2020 have featured a common rallying cry: \u201cDefund the police\u201d ( here ). This call predates the current protests and is driven both by anger at the militarized posture of many U.S. police departments and by the recognition they are being called on to confront social ills including addiction, mental illness and homelessness that, advocates say, could be better addressed by spending on social services and rethinking what behaviors should be considered crimes.\n\nWhile some envision virtually abolishing modern police departments, others see it as a call to slash city police budgets, which have grown significantly since the 1990s. Policing and corrections accounted for about 30% of general funding in Atlanta and Orlando in 2017, and nearly 40% in Chicago, according to a report from the Center for Popular Democracy, an advocacy group.\n\nIn his interview with Barkan, Biden does answer \u201cyes\u201d to redirecting some funding, but then changes the topic from policing to prison reform. The former vice president says the prison system \u201cshould be a rehabilitation system, not a punishment system,\u201d and that the formerly incarcerated should be given the same rights and be entitled to the same federal programs as Americans who have never gone to prison.\n\nBiden\u2019s \u201cYes, absolutely\u201d response in this interview does not reflect his campaign\u2019s stance on police reform. Available joebiden.com/justice/ , his platform for criminal justice reform promises to \u201creinvigorate community-oriented policing\u201d by strengthening the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, \u201cwhich authorized funding both for the hiring of additional police officers and for training on how to undertake a community policing approach.\u201d Biden intends to \u201creinvigorate\u201d the program with a $300-million investment, contingent on officers mirroring the diversity of their communities.\n\nIn an interview with Norah O\u2019Donnell ( here ) aired by CBS just three days before the NowThis clip was published, Biden said, \u201cI don\u2019t support defunding the police\u2026 I support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.\u201d ( here )\n\nContrary to the America First Action advert, Biden has not called for \u201cfewer resources\u201d for police departments. His campaign has said it is calling for police departments to receive funding that would allow them to provide better training, equip officers with body cameras and improve relationships with the communities they patrol ( here ).\n\nBiden has drawn criticism from progressive activists, who have expressed disappointment in his proposal to provide $300 million to the COPS program, arguing that doing so would only exacerbate the problem of over-policing ( here ).\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, Trump\u2019s campaign has hammered Biden for not expressly denouncing calls by activists nationwide to sharply curtail local and federal spending on police departments and to funnel money to nonviolent community safety programs ( here ).\n\nMisleading. The advert circulated on social media does not reflect Joe Biden\u2019s policy line thus far. His presidential platform does not include any promises to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
