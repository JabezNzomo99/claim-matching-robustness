But the account behind the tweet was actually linked to a white nationalist group, according to Twitter.\n\nDuring the protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a tweet shared widely online \u2014 espousing a plan to bring violence to \u201cresidential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u201d \u2014 was made to appear to be from antifa, the anti-fascist coalition.\n\n\u201cALERT,\u201d the May 31 tweet from \u201c@ANTIFA_US\u201d read. \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades.\u201d\n\nThe tweet landed in the context of nationwide protests spurred by the May 25 death of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, in police custody. The Minneapolis officer seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck in a viral video \u2014 a white man who was one of four officers fired over the death \u2014 has been charged with killing Floyd.\n\n\u201cTonight\u2026 we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours,\u201d the tweet declared. It also used the misspelled hashtag \u201c#BlacklivesMaters.\u201d\n\nBut Twitter says that the account, suspended May 31, was actually connected to a white nationalist group, Identity Evropa (also known as the American Identity Movement).\n\n\u201cThis account violated our platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson told us. \u201cWe took action after the account sent a Tweet inciting violence and broke the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nTwitter explicitly identified the account as being connected to Identity Evropa and said it had taken previous action against other fake accounts tied to the group.\n\nNBC News first reported the group behind the account.\n\nThere are no archived versions of the account prior to its suspension available on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. A screenshot of the account shows it was set up in May 2020 and that its flag contained the letters \u201cIE\u201d and its location was listed as \u201ciE.\u201d\n\nDespite Twitter suspending the account, screenshots of the tweet in question circulated widely on Facebook. It was further shared in stories such as one on the website ConcealedNation.org, which also gained traction on Facebook. And new posts of the screenshot have continued to surface even though the tweet promised the events to occur on May 31.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear the exact role antifa \u2014 known for using violent tactics \u2014 has played in the current demonstrations across the country. But President Donald Trump has targeted the group, claiming he would designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, even though there is no such official federal designation, as we\u2019ve previously explained.\n\n\u201cI want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail,\u201d Trump said during a June 1 address about the protests. \u201cThis includes antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence.\u201d\n\nWriting in the Washington Post, Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of \u201cAntifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\u201d said he suspects some members of antifa groups have been involved in the protests but that there aren\u2019t enough to be responsible for all of the acts of destruction.\n\nBray explained that \u201cantifa itself is not an overarching organization with a chain of command.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on my research into antifa groups, I believe it\u2019s true that most, if not all, members do wholeheartedly support militant self-defense against the police and the targeted destruction of police and capitalist property that has accompanied it this week,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBray said he was \u201calso confident that some members of antifa groups have participated in a variety of forms of resistance during this dramatic rebellion. Yet it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of people who belong to antifa groups because members hide their political activities from law enforcement and the far right, and concerns about infiltration and high expectations of commitment keep the sizes of groups rather small. Basically, there are nowhere near enough anarchists and members of antifa groups to have accomplished such breathtaking destruction on their own.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
