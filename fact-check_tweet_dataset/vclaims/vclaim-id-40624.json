Police are still investigating if it is true: The mother reported the attack to Corning, California, police on Friday, December 20, 2019, and she began tweeting about it three days later. Then, on December 25, she said \"police dont seem to care much.\"\n\nCorning Police Sgt. Ian Anderson told Lead Stories that his department is taking the case seriously and would have a report on their findings soon, possibly as early as Friday, December 27, 2019. He would not speculate about the veracity of the mother's claim that the attack was racial and political.\n\nThe claim originated from a series of tweets posted by the mother on December 23 and 25, 2019 (archived here), which included several photos of her son's bloodied face. One message read:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe mother's tweets raised skepticism on Twitter, with people questioning the details. Lead Stories called the Corning police for a response. Anderson said this on Thursday, December 26:\n\nShe and her son made a report on the incident at the skate park. We have an open investigation to determine the true facts of the case. Our agency takes pride in our service and the extent we investigate our cases. We took a thorough report at the time and met with them after the incident. We are actively working on fact checking everything ourselves.\n\nAnderson said the conclusions will be posted on the Corning Police Facebook page. Lead Stories is following this story and will update the findings after the investigation is concluded to check the validity of the mother's claims that the attack was both racial and political.\n\nWe recently debunked another story in which it was claimed that an attack on a 14-year-old on a Florida school bus was the start of a second American civil war.
