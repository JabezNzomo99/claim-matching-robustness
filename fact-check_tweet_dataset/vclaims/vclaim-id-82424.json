In security footage obtained by Fox News, and timestamped Monday at 3:08 p.m. Pacific Time, the California powerhouse is seen walking through eSalon in San Francisco with wet hair, and without a mask over her mouth or nose \u2026 Salons in San Francisco had been closed since March and were only notified they could reopen on Sept. 1 for outdoor hairstyling services only. \u2026 Salon owner Erica Kious, in a phone interview with Fox News on Tuesday, shared details of Pelosi\u2019s visit. Kious explained she has independent stylists working for her who rent chairs in her salon. \u201cOne of the stylists who rents a chair from me contacted me Sunday night,\u201d Kious said. A screengrab of the text message she received from one of her stylists, and obtained by Fox News, said: \u201cI\u2019ll be there at 2:45 tomorrow. Pelosi assistant just messaged me to do her hair.\u201d Kious replied: \u201cPelosi?\u201d \u201cI was like, are you kidding me right now? Do I let this happen? What do I do?\u201d Kious told Fox News, while noting that she \u201ccan\u2019t control\u201d what her stylists do if they rent chairs from her, as \u201cthey\u2019re not paying\u201d at this time. Kious cast Pelosi\u2019s visit as a double standard. \u201cIt was a slap in the face that she went in, you know, that she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in, and I can\u2019t work,\u201d Kious told Fox News, adding that she \u201ccan\u2019t believe\u201d the speaker didn\u2019t have a mask on. (From the footage, it appears Pelosi had some kind of covering around her neck.) \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to look up to this woman, right?\u201d Kious said. \u201cIt is just disturbing.\u201d\n\nOther major news outlets, including CNN and USA Today, followed up on Fox News\u2019 reporting.\n\nPelosi has claimed that she was the victim of a politically motivated \u201csetup,\u201d and the man who styled her hair has lashed out at the salon owner, claiming the latter authorized the appointment in advance, contrary to her assertion that she was outraged to hear about the visit. However, it is nonetheless true that Pelosi did visit the salon in San Francisco on Aug. 31, 2020, at a time when the city required non-essential businesses, including hair salons, to remain closed.\n\nOn Sept. 1, 2020, the San Francisco Department of Public Health introduced a new set of orders (Order of the health officer No. C19-07h). Among many other provisions, the new rules relaxed existing restrictions on what the document categorized as \u201cpersonal service providers\u201d \u2014 hair salons, nail salons, barber shops, skin care, and so on (page 24).\n\nBeginning at 9 a.m. on that date, those businesses could operate outdoors, under certain conditions, and with certain exceptions. Until then, an earlier set of orders (issued on Aug. 14, 2020) meant that businesses like hair salons could not operate at all. Since Pelosi\u2019s visit to eSalon took place on Aug. 31, the earlier, stricter orders were still in place at that time.\n\nA spokesperson for Pelosi confirmed for Snopes that the visit had taken place, writing in an emailed statement that the business (that is, eSalon) had told her local rules allowed it:\n\n\u201cThe Speaker always wears a mask and complies with local COVID requirements. This business offered for the Speaker to come in on Monday and told her they were allowed by the city to have one customer at a time in the business. The Speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment.\u201d\n\nAs we have shown, any understanding that local rules allowed a hair salon at that time to operate with even one customer in the building was mistaken. The spokesperson later clarified for Snopes that Pelosi\u2019s staff had not had any contact with Kious herself and confirmed CNN\u2019s earlier reporting that the Aug. 31 salon visit came about because another stylist, who usually goes to Pelosi\u2019s home, was not available on that date but recommended a colleague from eSalon. Therefore, the appointment was arranged with that \u201csubstitute\u201d stylist, and not Kious, but Kious did know about it in advance.\n\nAlthough Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson asserted that \u201cthe Speaker always wears a mask,\u201d the security footage from the salon, provided to Fox News, clearly shows her walking between two rooms without a mask over her mouth or nose for at least a few seconds.\n\nPelosi addressed that discrepancy in a combative exchange with reporters at an event in San Francisco on Sept. 2, 2020, which can be viewed in full here. She explained:\n\nPelosi was asked if she thought she should apologize to service industry workers for her actions. She replied: \u201cWell I don\u2019t. I think that this salon owes me an apology for setting [me] up.\u201d She added:\n\n\u201cI take responsibility for trusting the word of a neighborhood salon that I\u2019ve been to, over the years, many times, and that when they said \u2018We\u2019re able to accommodate people one person at a time\u2019 and that \u2018We can set up that time,\u2019 I trusted that. As it turns out, it was a setup. So I take responsibility for falling for a setup. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say on that.\u201d\n\nKious appeared as a guest on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News show later that evening and denied having \u201cset up\u201d Pelosi. However, around the same time, an attorney representing the stylist in question, Jonathan DeNardo, provided an explosive statement to several news outlets, including Snopes. In it, attorney Matthew Soleimanpour claimed that Kious had in fact authorized the appointment with Pelosi in advance, contrary to her assertions, and had made \u201cvitriolic and incendiary comments\u201d about the lawmaker in a phone call with DeNardo:\n\nMr. DeNardo has worked at eSalon for approximately six (6) years and regularly communicates with the salon owner, Erica Kious. In fact, Mr. DeNardo received advance approval from Ms. Kious the day prior to the appointment during a telephone discussion on August 30, 2020 at 9:26 pm, wherein Mr. DeNardo advised Ms. Kious that he would not proceed with Speaker Pelosi\u2019s appointment without Ms. Kious\u2019 authorization. Ms. Kious took special interest in the appointment during this telephone call, wherein she made several vitriolic and incendiary comments about Speaker Pelosi and her purported responsibility for temporarily suspending operations of Ms. Kious\u2019 business, despite such orders actually being put into place not by Speaker Pelosi, but by Governor Gavin Newsome and San Francisco Mayor London Breed. Ultimately, Ms. Kious authorized Mr. DeNardo to proceed with Speaker Pelosi\u2019s appointment. [\u2026] The fact that Ms. Kious is now objecting to Speaker Pelosi\u2019s presence at eSalon, and from a simple surface-level review of Ms. Kious\u2019 political leanings, it appears Ms. Kious is furthering a set-up of Speaker Pelosi for her own vain aspirations. Mr. DeNardo\u2019s name has now been dragged through the mud for simply following Ms. Kious\u2019 recommendations [\u2026].\n\nSnopes invited Kious to respond to the allegations made in DeNardo\u2019s statement, but we did not receive a response in time for publication.\n\nEven though the restrictions on hair salons were relaxed on Sep. 1, 2020, one day after Pelosi\u2019s appointment at eSalon, it is not the case that the visit would have been allowed if she had simply waited 24 hours.\n\nThe new orders, implemented on Sep. 1, 2020, allow hair salons to operate only on the condition that they provide services outdoors, and the document (page 24) emphasizes the requirement for both service provider and customer to \u201cwear a face covering at all times, including during the entire service\u201d \u2014 something Pelosi failed to do because she removed her mask for a brief period.\n\nFurthermore, Pelosi had her hair washed during the visit. If that involved the use of shampoo, it would also have contravened the new rules that stipulate \u201cshampooing, chemical hair services, and services that require the customers to remove their face coverings are not permitted at this time.\u201d Her spokesperson\u2019s explanation that Pelosi usually has her hair styled at her home also appears to go against the San Francisco orders. Both the version published on Aug. 14 (on page 18) and on Sept. 1 (on page 17) explicitly forbid hair dressers to \u201cprovide in-home services.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether, technically speaking, Pelosi herself violated the Aug. 14 orders or if only business owners or service providers can be regarded as being in breach. We asked San Francisco\u2019s COVID Command Center for clarification on that legal question, but we received a non-specific response to the effect that city officials \u201cemphasize compliance over punishment\u201d when it comes to violations of the COVID-19 orders.\n\nPelosi claimed she was \u201cset up\u201d by Kious, the owner of eSalon, after being advised by DeNardo, the stylist, that her visit was allowed under local rules. DeNardo\u2019s attorney has claimed, on his behalf, that Kious actually authorized the appointment in advance and expressed antipathy towards the speaker of the House.\n\nNonetheless, it remains the case that on Aug. 31, 2020, Pelosi visited the salon at a time when San Francisco barred hair salons from operating. While there, she briefly removed her face mask, something that would be prohibited even under more relaxed rules that have since been introduced. If she herself did not personally violate the rules, she undoubtedly participated in a violation of them.", "lang": "en"}
