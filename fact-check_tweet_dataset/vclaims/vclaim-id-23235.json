Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez likened detention centers holding illegal immigrants at the southern border to concentration camps in an Instagram Live video last week. Shortly thereafter, reports emerged detailing the poor conditions witnessed at some of these facilities.\n\nThe image, which depicts a Greenpeace banner hanging from the Last Vegas hotel in protest, is actually a screenshot of a video originally posted on Twitter. The video creator, Paul Lee Ticks, has a history of posting doctored images and videos on social media. In fact, he previously posted a video very similar to the one in question, only with a different message on the photoshopped banner.\n\nGreenpeace, an environmental nonprofit, often uses yellow banners to make political statements. Its members have even deployed prominent banners to protest the Trump administration in the past.\n\nHowever, Greenpeace confirmed that it took no such action in Las Vegas. Perry Wheeler, senior communications specialist for Greenpeace, told the Caller in an email, \u201cIt is indeed a fake video.\u201d\n\nIt also tweeted out a statement, declaring the video a hoax.\n\nAs demonstrated in its tweet, Greenpeace has taken a public stance on the detention facilities, though not in the manner alleged in the viral image.", "lang": "en"}
