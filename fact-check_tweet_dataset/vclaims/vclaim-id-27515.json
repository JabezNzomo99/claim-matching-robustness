Liberate Hong Kong\u201d, which has almost 8,000 followers. It has been shared 86 times.\n\nThe traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cHiding in a dark corner, shooting without warning and targeting people\u2019s heads and eyes.

Here is an AFP report about the Kwun Tong clashes.\n\nPolice have faced increasing brutality claims during the protests, as detailed in this AFP report.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe photo has also been shared dozens of times here and here with a similar claim by Facebook pages with thousands of followers.\n\nThe claim is misleading; a wider angle photo of the same scene shows the police officer was standing on a street next to a group of journalists.\n\nThe watermark for Stand News, a Hong Kong-based online news site, is visible on the photo. The same photo was published here on Stand News\u2019 Facebook page on August 24, 2019, without a caption.\n\nEarlier on August 24, Stand News uploaded a separate image from the scene here. The image is embedded below.\n\nThis image, which was shot from a wider, higher angle, shows the same police officer armed with a pepper ball gun standing next to a group of journalists.\n\n\u201cA police officer holding a pepper ball gun suddenly rushed to the street. Meanwhile, police officers have raised the red flag.\n\n\u201cAfter the protest at Kwun Tong MTR station this afternoon, some protesters have set up barriers in the Ngau Tau Kok and Kowloon Bay area. Riot police have been deployed accordingly.\u201d\n\nBelow is a comparison of the two Stand News photos taken at the same location:\n\nA street sign for \u201cWai Yip Street\u201d can be seen in the Stand News photo on the right.\n\nThe photo was captured here. The same location can be seen below on Google Street View.\n\nA journalist in AFP's Hong Kong bureau analysed this footage from local media outlet HK01 of the same police officer and found no evidence that he fired his pepper ball gun on Wai Yip Street when the photo was taken. The footage is embedded below.\n\nThe police officer can be seen from the three hours, 58 minutes and 23 seconds mark. At this point, a journalist can be heard speaking over the footage in Cantonese as the camera zooms in on the police officer. Her comments translate to English as: \"We see a Special Tactical Squad member holding a gun towards protesters.\"\n\nAfter ten seconds of pointing his gun towards protesters, the same officer lowers his gun. A loud noise can be heard in the background at this point, prompting the HK01 journalist to say in Cantonese: \"We have heard a gun shot.\"\n\nAbout two seconds later, the officer then raises his gun again but does not fire, as journalists gather around him. Two seconds later, he lowers in his gun and walks away. Below is a screenshot of the sequence:", "lang": "en"}
