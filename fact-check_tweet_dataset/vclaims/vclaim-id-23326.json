The original picture was first published in The Washington Post in 2007, in an article on a French female butcher, Stephanie Gerbier.\n\nThis particular viral picture is circulating on social media since 2014. This particular Facebook post by Vinita Agarwal on Sibals, which was uploaded on March 8, 2019, has been shared by more than 7500 users, till the time of writing this article.\n\nSeveral other people have also posted the same content on Facebook.\n\nUsing a combination of reverse image search and keywords search, we found that the original article \"The New Artisans\" was published in The Washinton Post on June 6, 2007.\n\nThe article was written on a butcher from France, Stephanie Gerbier. Stephanie, a French woman had gone against his family's wish to choose this profession.\n\nThe viral image shows smiling Kapil Sibal holding a large portion of raw flesh in his hands, while his wife, Promila Sibal, in a white apron standing beside him.\n\nComparing closely with the original image published in The Washington Post, we can clearly find that the images of Sibals used in the viral one are morphed and superimposed.\n\nFact Check website SMhoaxlaye debunked this claim that went viral in 2017.\n\nIt has been reported several times in various news websites that Promila Sibal is a meat exporter and owns several abattoirs. This can be read here and here.\n\nBut the image used in the viral post is photoshopped.", "lang": "en"}
