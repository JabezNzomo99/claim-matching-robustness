Some in the \u201cmiddle class\u201d \u2014 however we might define that \u2014 would see higher taxes, but others would see a tax cut, according to an analysis of the GOP framework by the Tax Policy Center. The president is wrong to say everybody would benefit, while Pelosi ignores that most taxpayers in the group she considers the \u201cmiddle class\u201d would see a tax cut.\n\nThe president also said that the tax plan \u201censures that the benefits of tax reform go to the middle class, not to the highest earners,\u201d but the Tax Policy Center analysis found most of the benefits of the tax cut go to the top 1 percent.\n\nThe White House and GOP congressional leaders released the framework of their tax plan on Sept. 27.\n\nThe plan would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent; abolish the alternative minimum tax; collapse the seven income tax brackets, ranging from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, to three (12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent); increase the standard deduction but eliminate exemptions; eliminate most itemized deductions except for mortgage interest and charitable giving; increase the child tax credit; and abolish the estate tax.\n\nThere are many details missing from that framework, such as the income thresholds for the tax brackets, the amount of the child tax credit and more. The Tax Policy Center was able to do a \u201cpreliminary analysis,\u201d using previous GOP and Trump administration proposals to fill in the blanks. \u201cWhile the revenue, distributional, and economic effects are likely to\n\n change as policy makers negotiate the details,\u201d the TPC wrote in its report, \u201cthis analysis provides an estimate of the effects of the September 27 framework as we currently understand it.\u201d\n\nThe Tax Policy Center is a nonpartisan think tank. Its tax policy experts rely on federal tax data and use the same tax modeling techniques practiced by the Treasury Department and nonpartisan congressional tax experts, such as those at the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nPelosi made her claim twice on Oct. 5, on the floor of the House and in a press availability. She described the GOP tax cut as beneficial for the wealthy and \u201ccorporate America\u201d but a tax hike of a half a trillion dollars for the \u201cmiddle class.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, in an interview with Mike Huckabee on Trinity Broadcasting Network on Oct. 7, described the plan as having the opposite effect: a benefit for the middle class and not a tax cut for the wealthy.\n\nThe president reiterated that in a speech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 11, saying: \u201cBy eliminating tax breaks and special interest loopholes that primarily benefit the wealthy, our framework ensures that the benefits of tax reform go to the middle class, not to the highest earners.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s figures on business tax cuts and the benefits to the top 1 percent are correct, per TPC\u2019s analysis. \u201cThe business income tax provisions \u2014 including those affecting corporations and pass-through businesses \u2014 would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion over the first ten years,\u201d the TPC report said. And it found that 80 percent of the benefit of tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent income-earners in 2027.\n\nBut what about the \u201cmiddle class,\u201d or as the president says, \u201cmiddle income people\u201d?\n\nAs the plan stands now, some would get a tax cut and some would see a tax increase in every income quintile or group.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the big picture. Overall, the GOP tax framework would be a net tax cut for taxpayers in 2018 and 2027, according to the TPC analysis (see Tables 2 and 3).\n\n\u201cIn 2018, all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face tax increases. Those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts,\u201d the TPC report says. \u201cThe tax cuts are smaller as a percentage of income in 2027, and taxpayers in the 80th to 95th income percentiles would, on average, experience a tax increase.\u201d\n\nTPC separates taxpayers into five groups, or quintiles, based on their income. Which income groups make up the \u201cmiddle class\u201d? There is no standard definition for the term, as we wrote back in 2008. We found then that the vast majority of Americans had said in polls that they consider themselves to be \u201cmiddle class\u201d or \u201cupper-middle class\u201d or \u201cworking class.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s still true today. In a June 2017 Gallup survey, 44 percent said they were \u201cmiddle class,\u201d 28 percent chose \u201cworking class\u201d and 18 percent said \u201cupper-middle class.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelatively few consider themselves to be lower class or upper class, at 8% and 2%, respectively,\u201d Gallup said. \u201cOverall, \u2018middle class\u2019 is the label Americans use more than any other to describe their social class, providing a useful catchphrase for politicians interested in appealing to the broadest swath of the public.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Pelosi is talking about a broad swath of the public when she claims that the GOP plan is a $470 billion tax hike on the \u201cmiddle class.\u201d She\u2019s including all but the top 10 percent of taxpayers.\n\nDeputy Communications Director Henry Connelly explained to us that the staff calculated that figure using tables 2 and 3 of the TPC report, which give percentages for the taxpayers that would see a tax cut or a tax increase, broken down by income groups, and TPC figures for the number of taxpayers in each group. Pelosi\u2019s staff considered all taxpayers at the 90th percentile and below \u201cmiddle class.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2018, that comes out to be around $26 billion a year, and by 2027, it\u2019s around $73 billion,\u201d Connelly said. \u201cIf you project those numbers across the 10 years you get almost half a trillion dollars taken in higher taxes on the middle class.\u201d\n\nConnelly told us that not going up to the 90th percentile \u201ccan exclude a lot of middle class families, especially when recognizing the burdens of child care costs or high cost areas.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll leave that for readers to judge.\n\nAccording to the TPC, the 90th percentile is about $217,000 in \u201cexpanded cash income\u201d or about $158,000 in adjusted gross income in 2018. Expanded cash income is pretax income that also includes employee and employer contributions to health insurance and tax-preferred retirement accounts, retirement account income, non-taxable Social Security or pension income, employer share of payroll taxes, and food stamps. Expanded cash income would be similar to the total compensation reports that some employers send annually to employees, showing not just wages but benefits paid on their behalf.\n\nThe TPC uses expanded cash income. Joseph Rosenberg, one of the authors of the TPC report, told us the income distribution tables would change if the analysis used adjusted gross income instead, but it probably wouldn\u2019t have \u201ca very significant effect\u201d in terms of where taxpayers fall in the income percentiles.\n\nWe were able to duplicate Pelosi\u2019s math for the year 2027, showing a tax increase of nearly $73 billion that year on taxpayers at the 90th percentile and below. But that same arithmetic shows a tax cut of even more \u2014 $102 billion \u2014 on the same group of taxpayers. Most taxpayers at the 90th percentile and below \u2014 about 65 percent of them \u2014 would get a tax cut in 2027, based on our calculations of TPC data.\n\nIn other words, while some in what Pelosi considers the \u201cmiddle class\u201d would see a tax increase, according to the TPC analysis of the GOP framework, more in that same group would see a tax cut.\n\nThat also clearly shows that, as the plan stands now, not \u201ceverybody\u2019s gonna benefit,\u201d as the president said.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Tax Policy Center explains the distributional effects: \u201cIn 2018, about 12 percent of taxpayers would face a tax increase of roughly $1,800 on average. More than a third of taxpayers making between about $150,000 and $300,000 would pay more, mainly because most itemized deductions would be repealed. \u2026 By 2027, taxes would rise for roughly one-quarter of taxpayers, including nearly 30 percent of those with incomes between about $50,000 and $150,000 and 60 percent of those making between about $150,000 and $300,000.\u201d\n\nThe tax impact in 2027 would be worse for more taxpayers than in 2018 partly because, the TPC report explains, \u201cthe plan would replace personal exemptions, which are indexed for inflation, with additional credits for children and non-child dependents that are not indexed for inflation.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the TPC chart for 2027, showing the percentage of taxpayers getting tax cuts or tax increases that year, the average amounts and the overall change by income percentile. (See the full report for the footnotes for the chart, including the percentile thresholds.)\n\nTrump specifically mentioned \u201cmiddle income people,\u201d and later in that interview said, \u201cmiddle income people, or the working people as I call them.\u201d Middle-income would be the middle quintile \u2014 taxpayers with expanded cash income of about $50,000 to $90,000 a year. That group, too, would see mixed results.\n\nOverall, the TPC said the Republican plan is \u201ca small tax cut for middle-income households.\u201d But again, some would see a tax increase.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, the framework would cut taxes for moderate-income households by an average of $660, or 1.2 percent of their after-tax income,\u201d Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow with TPC, wrote on the center\u2019s website. \u201cBut not everyone would win. In 2018, about one in seven middle income households would pay an average of $1,000 more in taxes under this plan. By 2027, more than one of every four middle-income families would pay more in taxes.\u201d\n\nThe president claimed in Harrisburg that \u201cour framework ensures that the benefits of tax reform go to the middle class, not to the highest earners.\u201d But that\u2019s not what the framework ensures.\n\nA majority of the top quintile (taxpayers earning $154,900 and above in 2027) would see their taxes increase, according to the TPC table above, which shows 53.4 percent of the top quintile with an average tax increase of $4,400. But 46.4 percent in that group see an average tax cut of $27,910.\n\nFor the highest earners \u2014 those in the top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent \u2014 nearly all would see lower taxes. Ninety percent of the top 1 percent \u2014 those earning about $900,000 and above in 2027 \u2014 would get a tax cut, averaging $234,050.", "lang": "en"}
