This must be satire. It can't be true that Trump was born in the Philippines, right?\n\nOn 21 September 2016, the Washington Post published a satirical poem by humorist Garrison Keillor that included a line stating Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was born in the city of Manila in the Phillippines, and not in Queens, New York:\n\nThe poem was not preceded or followed by any disclaimers labeling it as satire, leaving some readers fooled into thinking that Keillor was making a bold declaration about Trump\u2019s non-American birthplace. However, the opening stanza made it clear that the focus of the poem was to mock Trump\u2019s spreading of various conspiracy theories during the 2016 campaign:\n\nDonald Trump was in fact born in Queens, New York. His birth certificate states that he was born at Jamaica Hospital on 14 June 1946:", "lang": "en"}
