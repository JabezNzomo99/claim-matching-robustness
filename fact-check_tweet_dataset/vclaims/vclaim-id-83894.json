The claim is false; the image has been doctored from an original in which there was no Pakistan flag.\n\nThis Facebook post containing the photo was published on April 8, 2019, on a page that has more than 50,000 followers.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201cSambit Patra did Sajda on a Pakistani Flag, It's a shame BJP has gone this low for fetching votes in Puri. As u know, West Bengal, is more Pakistan than Pakistan itself, and Mamata Bannerjee is more Jinnahfied, than Jinnah himself. Speculations were that there are many Pakistani voters migrated from Bengal, and Lehsoonwa did his 'Abba-Style' neechpan by bowing down to our enemy's flag to get those Pakistani votes.\n\n\u201cI was fine when Mudi Zee went to Pakistan to have Beef Biryani, I was even fine when Walruschoda declared Pakistan as our brother country, I was, somehow, still fine when ISI agents were caught from BJP's higher posts. But this has crossed all limits, Sajda x Pakistani Flag? Mulla x Mulla? Mulla square? with 2AB extra? Chh.. Chh.. Chh... Nindaniye! ? #Fake_it_like_BJPee\u201d\n\nSambit Patra is one of the BJP\u2019s official spokesmen.

This is her official Twitter account, where she describes herself as the founder chairperson of the All India Trinamool Congress, and Honourable Chief Minister of West Bengal.\n\n\u201cJinnahfied\u201d refers to Mohammad Ali Jinnah, an Indian Muslim politician who was the founder and first governor-general of Pakistan. This is his official biography on the Britannica Encyclopedia.\n\n\u201cISI\u201d refers to the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency of Pakistan. This article published by US-based research site Tracking Terrorism states the agency was founded in 1948.\n\nThe photo in the misleading Facebook post has been doctored from this original photo posted by Sambit Patra on his official Twitter handle on April 7, 2019.\n\nThe tweet says: \"The huge turnout at the 'Vishal Jansabha' and 'Mishran Parv' in Odagaon, Puri Loksabha Constituency is a clear indication of a clean sweep .
