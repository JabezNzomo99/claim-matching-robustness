His estate at Mount Vernon labels it a \u201cspurious quotation.\u201d\n\nWashington, like many of the founding fathers, is often credited with expressions he never actually said or wrote. The specific quote about agriculture appears to be one such example. (RELATED: Did George Washington Say This Quote About A \u2018Government\u2019s Right To Govern\u2019?)\n\nIndeed, there is no record of Washington ever making the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched the Papers of George Washington and the National Archives online database for the expression but turned up no matches. It doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in his correspondence or recorded speeches either.\n\nWashington\u2019s estate at Mount Vernon includes the saying on its \u201cspurious quotations\u201d page, with the entry reading, \u201cThe library has yet to find an explanation for this misquote or locate another individual who said this statement.\u201d\n\nWhile there is little evidence that Washington ever said or wrote the expression, he did hold agricultural work in high regard. In a 1794 letter to John Sinclair, Washington wrote, \u201cI know of no pursuit in which more zeal & important service can be rendered to any Country than by improving its agriculture \u2013 its breed of useful animals \u2013 and other branches of a husbandman\u2019s cares.\u201d\n\nThe misattributed quote has appeared in agricultural publications since at least the 1830s, according to Mount Vernon.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
