Though the post does not name a brand, Reuters reached out to major infant formula producers in the U.S. and the United Kingdom and found that this claim was false.\n\nGerber Products Company, a subsidiary of Nestle, is a worldwide producer of baby food and baby products, including infant formula (here).\n\nIn response to the circulating claims, Gerber added a message to its parent resource center hotline. When you dial 800-628-BABY (2229), you hear the following: \u201cWe are aware of a rumor circulating on social media that states there are free cases of formula available if you call and request them. While we are more than happy to suggest retail partners to you to help you locate our products, we do not have any sampling programs available at this time.\u201d\n\nReuters also got in touch with Enfamil, an infant formula brand made by Mead Johnson (www.enfamil.com/). In an email, an Enfamil representative wrote, \u201cEnfamil products can be located through our Enfamil Store Locator and purchased directly from our Enfamil Shop at our regular retail prices. Contrary to rumors in some online social networks, we are not distributing free cases of formula.\u201d\n\nReuters contacted representatives from the formula brand Similac (here), but did not receive comment by the time of this article\u2019s publication.

This is not true. In the U.K. \u2013 as in all markets in which we operate \u2013 Danone complies with strict regulations. The company is not [allowed] to send out formula products to parents for free, as is the case for any formula products sold in the U.K.\u201d\n\nReuters could not find confirmation that families could get free baby formula by calling manufacturers during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nFalse: Families in need cannot get free baby formula by calling the number on the back of the product.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
