This seems to have come directly from the announcement published by the Department of Health and Social Care, which says the same thing.\n\nIn 2017, the WHO announced that the UK, along with a number of other countries, had eliminated measles as of 2016.\n\nThe word 'eliminated' might make it sound like there were no cases of measles that year, but that's not what it means\u2014the way the WHO uses it has a technical meaning that's a bit different to what you might expect. At the time the WHO said \u201cElimination of measles or rubella can be verified once a country has sustained interruption of endemic transmission for at least 36 months.\u201d\n\nAccording to Public Health England: \u201cWHO defines measles elimination as the absence of circulating measles, in the presence of high vaccine coverage, along with good systems to identify cases of the disease.\n\n\u201cIn countries that have eliminated measles, measles can still occur, but these will be isolated cases that only have limited spread within the community.\u201d\n\nThere were around 300 confirmed cases in 2017 and around 600 in 2016 across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Vaccine Knowledge Project at the University of Oxford has previously said that: \u201cThe majority of measles cases have been in people who are not vaccinated, especially young people aged 15 and over who missed out on MMR vaccination when they were younger.\n\n\u201cAbout 30% of those infected have been admitted to hospital. At the moment most UK measles cases are linked to travel in Europe.\n\n\u201cMeasles cases have also been linked to music festivals and other large public events.\u201d\n\nIn 2018 there were almost 1,000 cases of measles confirmed across the UK.", "lang": "en"}
