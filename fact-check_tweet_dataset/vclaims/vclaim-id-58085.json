The image contained the letterhead of the CBCP, was labeled \"Circular No. 20-26,\" and dated May 1.\n\nIt urged the recipients to do a \"mass report\" on Facebook and YouTube, and said that accounts will be reported to the National Bureau of Investigation's Cybercrime Division.\n\nThe circular also asked the bishops and diocesan administrators not to post a statement so as not to trigger attention and curiosity that will draw more people to the social media accounts.\n\nThe original advisory released by the CBCP Secretariat to the dioceses was meant to address the \"CBCP Official\" Facebook page, labeling it as \"fake.\" This circular asked bishops and diocesan administrators to mass report the page to Facebook.\n\nThe altered circular also changed the number of the circular to \"20-26\" and changed the date to May 1.\n\nHowever, as posted by church-run Radio Veritas, CBCP Circular No. 20-26 was about the National Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nRappler debunked other false claims about the CBCP \u2013 a statement about Sister Patricia Fox that was also falsely attributed to it, along with a post that alleged it owned stocks in San Miguel Corporation. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
