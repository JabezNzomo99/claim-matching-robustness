Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post\n\nClaim: Video of Telangana CM KCR announcing new curfew timings from tomorrow. Fact: It is an old video. The video was clipped from CM KCR\u2019s press meet on 24 March 2020. Also, no such new announcement has been made by the Telangana government recently. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched with the mentioned timings, it was found that similar timings were announced by the Telangana Chief Minister in his press meet on 24 March 2020. The recorded live of his press meet on 24 March 2020 can be found on the \u2018Telangana CMO\u2019 official Facebook page. In the video, from 18:10 \u2013 19:20, the posted video can be watched. So, the posted video was clipped from the CM KCR\u2019s press meet on 24 March 2020. The same video can be also found on YouTube. All his press meets related to COVID-19 can be found here. It can be found that his last press meet regarding COVID-19 was on 18 May 2020.\n\nThe Telangana Government\u2019s circulars and government orders regarding COVID-19 can be found here. It can be seen that no such decision of imposing new curfew timings was taken. Also, today CM KCR was on his visit to the family of martyr Colonel Santosh Babu in Suryapet, which can be watched here. The night curfew will remain in force from 9 PM to 5 AM daily, until further notice from the government.\n\nTo sum it up, new curfew timings were not announced by Telangana CM KCR. The posted video was clipped from CM KCR\u2019s press meet on 24 March 2020.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
