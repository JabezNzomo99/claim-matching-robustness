Justin Trudeau would have been four at the time.\n\nA picture in colour, from the same trip, shows Pierre, his wife Margaret, and baby Michel Trudeau with Fidel Castro. All the evidence we\u2019ve seen suggests they were the only three members of the family who visited Cuba in 1976, and that Justin (as well as his brother Sasha, who was two at the time) did not make the trip.\n\nWhen Fidel Castro died in 2016, Justin Trudeau said he had only \u201chad the opportunity to meet Fidel when my father passed away\u201d in the year 2000.", "lang": "en"}
