However, doctors told AFP there\u2019s \u201cno scientific evidence\u201d to support this and warned people against herbal treatments.\n\n\u201cGOOD NEWS FOR CANCER PATIENTS,\u201d reads one post, which we\u2019ve archived here. \u201cTHE CURE IS HERE.\u201d It was posted on Nigerian Facebook page \u2018Healing herbal\u2019, which has more than 50,000 followers.\n\n\u201cWILD EGG PLANT KILLS CANCER IN ONE MONTH,\u201d says another post, which has been shared more than 250 times since it was published in August.\n\nThe posts share a recipe of wild aubergine mixed with water or beer, which they say patients should drink twice a day to \u201ckill cancer outright\u201d.\n\nAFP found similar claims in Facebook posts that are supposedly endorsed by doctors. A post from October on a Zambian Facebook page called \u2018Dr Gilliard Pharmacy\u2019 claims that drinking wild aubergine mixed with water will make cancer \u201cdisappear\u201d.\n\nA reverse image search on the Facebook page\u2019s profile picture, which shows a man wearing a stethoscope, reveals he is not \u2018Dr Gilliard\u2019 but actually an American doctor called Paul Rivas, whom we can see talking in this video about his weight loss pills.\n\nMany comments on the posts express gratitude for the advice or ask for more information about the recipe.\n\nHowever, medical professionals told AFP that the claim is false and warned of the risks of turning to herbal remedies to treat cancer.\n\n\u201cThere is no scientific evidence that wild aubergine plant can cure cancer,\u201d said Dr Samuel Smith, associate professor at the Leeds Institute of Health Sciences in the UK.\n\n\u201cThe scientific consensus from high quality large trials shows that natural and herbal treatments do not affect cancer outcomes, and could cause serious harm,\u201d he told AFP by email.\n\nCancer Research UK\u2019s head information nurse Martin Ledwick said patients should speak to their doctor before considering any alternative or complementary medicine.\n\n\u201cHerbal medicine and so called \u2018natural\u2019 cures have not been properly tested and should not be relied on. They could interact with other medicines that a person is taking and sometimes they may even have a harmful effect,\u201d he told AFP by email.\n\nWhere does the claim come from?\n\nTo find out more about the origin of the claim, AFP ran keyword searches on Facebook. We found a post from 2017 about an \u2018eggplant cancer cure\u2019 on a page called \u2018The Truth About Cancer\u2019, which has more than one million followers.\n\nThe post features a video promoting Curaderm BEC5, described on the product\u2019s website as \u2018The Eggplant Skin Cancer Cream\u2019.\n\nIn 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wrote a warning letter reprimanding the company behind Curaderm for marketing the product without their approval.\n\nAlthough the \u2018eggplant skin cancer cream\u2019 has not been approved by the FDA, it is widely available online.\n\nContacted by AFP, a spokesman for the agency warned consumers to be wary of \u201cfraud products\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn general, consumers should be cautious of products marketed and sold online claiming to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent any disease,\u201d he told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is very concerned about these fraud products, and removing these products from the market remains one of the agency's top priorities.\u201d\n\nAFP has previous debunked various social media posts promoting false cures for cancer, including claims that drinking warm water or eating a sugar-free diet can cure the disease.", "lang": "en"}
