This claim is misleading.\n\nExamples of the claim can be seen here and here . Some comments on the posts express skepticism over whether the images are real, while others consider the images proof that the food chain is \u201cracist\u201d.\n\nThese images were not taken recently but have been circulating online amid the protests over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was killed after a white police officer knelt on his neck on May 25, 2020 in Minneapolis.\n\nA representative from Jackson Spalding, Chick-fil-A\u2019s public relations firm confirmed to Reuters that these t-shirts were made in 2015 by \u201cone locally owned-and-operated Chick-fil-A restaurant\u201d to support a local high school football team. \u201cThe photo is currently being taken out of context,\u201d the representative told Reuters, \u201cso we apologize for any confusion this has caused.\u201d\n\nReuters was unable to find many local news reports regarding the t-shirts from 2015. One points to the slogan representing both \u201csupport for law enforcement\u201d as well as \u201cthe local high school football team\u201d ( here ).\n\nIn November 2015, PoliceOne, an outlet that covers law-enforcement, also reported that employees at a Chick-fil-A franchise location in Conroe Texas \u201cwore \u2018Back the Blue\u2019 shirts to show support to law enforcement\u201d as well as a local football team ( here ).\n\nIn 2016, Snopes debunked the claim that these t-shirts were distributed to Chick-fil-A employees in response to shootings at a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas that killed at least five police officers ( here ).\n\nChick-fil-A executives recently released a statement addressing recent events and demonstrations in the U.S. ( here ).\n\nPartly false. Chick-fil-A did not distribute \u201cBack the Blue\u201d shirts in response to recent Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
