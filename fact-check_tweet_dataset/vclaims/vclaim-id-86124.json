An anonymous op-ed article by a senior administration official had just been published in the New York Times, and news circulated about journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s insider account of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nTrump\u2019s tsunami of untruths helped push the count in The Fact Checker\u2019s database past 5,000 on the 601st day of his presidency. That\u2019s an average of 8.3 Trumpian claims a day, but in the past nine days \u2014 since our last update \u2014 the president has averaged 32 claims a day.\n\nOn nearly 140 occasions, the president has falsely claimed that the Russia investigation was made up or a hoax. But the information on Russian efforts to sway the 2016 election was developed by the intelligence community and published in a declassified report, in which the agencies said they had \u201chigh confidence\u201d it was correct.\n\nOne of his campaign aides has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts overseas, including one connection who disclosed that the Russians had Democratic Party emails. The president\u2019s son, son-in-law and campaign chairman met at Trump Tower in June 2016 with someone they thought was a representative of the Russian government and who had promised \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton \u2014 and then tried to cover up that fact.\n\nThat\u2019s just spin that ignores a raft of official reports. A study by George Washington University estimated the death toll at between 2,658 and 3,290. Puerto Rico adopted the midpoint number, 2,975, as its official death toll. The island\u2019s population dropped 8 percent because of the death toll and heavy out-migration after the hurricanes, according to the GWU study. A separate report by the Government Accountability Office found a litany of issues that prevented the Federal Emergency Management Agency from responding quickly and efficiently to the Puerto Rican disaster. Full power was not restored to Puerto Rico for 11 months after the hurricane.\n\nA new Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll of 1,500 randomly selected adult residents of Puerto Rico found that 80 percent rate Trump\u2019s response to Maria negatively. Many still struggle with basic necessities, with 83 percent reporting either major damage to their homes, losing power for more than three months, employment setbacks or worsening health problems, along with spotty power and dangerous, unrepaired roads.\n\n\u201cEvery death is a horror, but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here and what is your death count? Sixteen people, versus in the thousands,\u201d he said on Oct. 3, 2017. \u201cYou can be very proud. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people.\u201d\n\nAlmost one-third of Trump\u2019s claims \u2014 1,573 \u2014 in The Fact Checker\u2019s database relate to economic issues, trade deals or jobs. He frequently takes credit for jobs created before he became president or company decisions with which he had no role. He cites his \u201cincredible success\u201d in terms of job growth, even though annual job growth under his presidency has been slower than the last five years of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure. Almost 50 times, Trump has claimed that the economy today is the \u201cgreatest\u201d in U.S. history, an absurd statement not backed up by data.\n\nIn the wake of the Woodward book, Trump resurrected a claim that dates from his first 100 days in office \u2014 that he has accomplished more than any other president in history in the same period of time. He made that statement six times in four days after news reports about the Woodward book.\n\nBesides the tax bill, Trump has signed few noteworthy pieces of legislation, in contrast with the whirlwind of major bills passed in the first two years of the administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson or Obama. As of his 600th day, Trump had signed about the same number of bills as Obama and George W. Bush but is behind every other president since Dwight D. Eisenhower, according to a calculation by Joshua Tauberer of GovTrack. He noted that Trump is just behind Obama in terms of the number of pages, indicating that much of the legislation he has signed has been about increasing government spending.", "lang": "en"}
