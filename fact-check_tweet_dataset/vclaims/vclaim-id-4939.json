There are, indeed, established channels of communications designed specifically to avoid dangerous collisions.\n\nThere have been multiple instances, however, in which Russia intentionally ignored protocol, initiating incidents that the U.S. military said where \u201cprovocative and dangerous.\u201d\n\nAccording to the European Leadership Network [ELN], a London-based policy group focusing on defense and security issues, in \u201cRussia \u2013 West Dangerous Brinkmanship,\u201d the organization details 66 incidents identifiable from public sources that took place between March 2014 and March 2015.\n\nThe \u201cincidents\u201d keep occurring regularly. On January 29, 2018 a Russian Su-27 fighter jet buzzed and shadowed a U.S. \u0415\u0420-3\u0415 Aries II in international airspace over the Black Sea. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed there was \u201cno incident\u201d and called it a routine operation. According to the ministry, the Russian fighter jet approached at a \u201csafe distance\u201d and the flight \u201cwas performed in strict compliance with international rule[s] of airspace use.\u201d\n\n\u200b\u201cThe Russian side was flagrantly violating existing agreements and international law, in this case the 1972 Agreement for the Prevention of Incidents On and Over the High Seas (INCSEA),\u201d said Heather Nauert, the U.S. State Department spokesperson. \"The United States notes with the highest level of concern the latest incident of unsafe Russian military practices.\u201d\n\nIn February 2018, the Russian paramilitary group \u201cWagner\u201d moved in on an oil refinery occupied by U.S. soldiers near Deir el-Zour in Syria, sustaining heavy losses in a counter-attack from the American forces. According to the audio recordings obtained by Polygraph.info, the Russians had full knowledge of the presence of the U.S. troops and attacked the base anyway.\n\nU.S. military officials said the coalition was in contact with Russia before, during and after the February 7-8 attack and had alerted Russia to the presence of SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces) personnel in that area.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the Russians had told the U.S. military that they did not have any forces at the base.", "lang": "en"}
