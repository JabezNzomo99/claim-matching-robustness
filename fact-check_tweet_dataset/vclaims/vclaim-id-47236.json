The video is being shared in the context of the ongoing border dispute between India and China along the LAC (Line of Actual Control). During the clashes at Galwan valley on 15 June 2020, at least 20 Indian soldiers had lost their lives. However, FACTLY has found the video in the post to be old and not related to the ongoing border clashes. The video is found to exist on the internet at least since 07 November 2019. FACTLY could not ascertain the exact context of the video, but it definitely does not represent the martyred Indian soldiers in the recent faceoff with the Chinese troops in Galwan Valley, Ladakh. The video shows a play depicting the loss of lives of the army.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
