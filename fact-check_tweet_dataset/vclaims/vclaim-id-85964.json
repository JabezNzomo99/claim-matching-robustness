(Because of how states report the numbers, some may have already had coverage. Sean Trende at Real Clear Politics has also raised questions about the 3.9 million figure. Update: There are serious issues with the 3.9 million figure.) The article also incorrectly assumes that everyone whose plan did not meet Affordable Care Act standards but who did not sign up for a plan via the exchanges has been left without coverage.\n\nOf course, not everyone ended up with essentially the same plan \u2014 or liked the options, either from their insurance company or the Obamacare exchanges. Under intense political pressure, the White House ordered an administrative fix that, depending on the actions of individual states, allowed as many as 2.3 million people with \u201ccanceled plans\u201d to simply stay on their old plan for at least another year. Thus they also did not lose coverage, contrary to the Daily Caller\u2019s claim.\n\nBuck said that there is a \u201cDemocratic mindset that as long as there is another plan they\u2019ve found \u2014 whether Obamacare, re-enrollment, or the new catastrophic exemption \u2014 that negates the fact that people had the plan they had \u2014 and potentially liked \u2014 canceled in the first place. From our perspective, that is nothing to overlook. In fact, it goes to one of our central arguments against the law \u2014 the government deciding what constitutes health coverage. The president promised people could keep their plans. And in astounding numbers that proved not to be true.\u201d\n\nBuck\u2019s point is certainly a valid argument, but the problem is that Boehner\u2019s statement (and those of other GOP lawmakers) could be interpreted as saying what the Daily Caller article incorrectly asserted \u2014 that millions of people are lacking coverage, as opposed to being forced into coverage they may not have wanted. (Boehner\u2019s tweet did link to the article, after all.)\n\nIndeed, the number of people who thus far have signed up to receive insurance through the exchanges (2.1 million) is merely a subset of the number of people whose plans were canceled (4.7 million); it makes little sense to compare them because the number of people on exchanges will be a smaller number than the number of people whose plans were not compliant with the law. (At this point, it\u2019s unclear who never had insurance in the first place.) It\u2019s kind of like saying the number of people who only eat apples is smaller than the number of people who only eat apples, oranges or bananas.\n\nWe are primarily examining Boehner\u2019s tweet, but aides to Barrasso and Rubio also defended their statements. Emily Schillinger, spokeswoman for Barrasso, pointed to an Associated Press article that laid out the number of canceled policies in each state, coming up with a total of 4.7 million. The number for Wyoming is 3,200. (Barrasso said \u201cthousands and thousands.\u201d) Regarding Wyoming, the AP also notes: \u201cInsurance companies were given the option to renew, and the state insurance commissioner says most of the older plans will be extended for 2014.\u201d\n\nAlex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, noted that the senator\u2019s full statement made clear he was referring to the private insurance market and thus was not including Medicaid. \u201cMore Americans have lost their insurance plans (about 4.7 million) than enrolled for insurance through the exchanges (2 million),\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the administration offered the fire sale in the final days of the enrollment period \u2014 to try to improve the otherwise embarrassing numbers.\u201d\n\nIt is correct, according to the AP\u2019s count, that 4.7 million people received a letter saying that their insurance was canceled. From a political perspective, perhaps it does not matter if the transition to another plan was seamless; they still got a cancellation letter, contrary to the president\u2019s famous pledge. But that does not mean that the 4.7 million figure can be easily compared to the number of people signing up for coverage via the exchanges.\n\n\u201cMore than 3,000 people in Wyoming had their insurance canceled under the law. We have no idea how many were happy with the insurance choices they were left with, but we do know that there are not as many options in our state and that fewer than 1,000 people have been able to sign up on the Obamacare exchange.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
