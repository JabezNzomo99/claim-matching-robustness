These messages appeared in April, after several members of the Tablighi Jamaat - an Islamic Missionary group, tested positive for the virus following a massive congregation in Delhi in March.\n\nWe also found evidence suggesting that the number of fact checks published by us had a positive correlation with the number of COVID-19 cases in the country. During this period, as the number of cases grew, so did the number of pandemic-related fact checks by BOOM.\n\n\n\nWhile most of the false or misleading claims were circulated with videos (35%), there was also a significant number of text messages (29.4%) being shared with fake cures, treatments or quotes from celebrities, along with images (29.4%) that were either misrepresented or doctored. We also noticed a small number of audio clips (2.2%) going viral with false contexts.\n\nA few of our fact checks were on news reports (4%) by mainstream media organisations. Most of these stories were found to make false claims against a particular community.\n\n\n\nWhile BOOM did its first COVID-19 fact check on January 25, the month of February saw major events like the Delhi Elections, Donald Trump's India visit and the Delhi riots dominate the fake news cycle.\n\nThere was a drastic change of topic in March, as more COVID-19 related misinformation went viral online.\n\nGo to the next page to see our analysis on the misinformation trends, observed through our fact checks.", "lang": "en"}
