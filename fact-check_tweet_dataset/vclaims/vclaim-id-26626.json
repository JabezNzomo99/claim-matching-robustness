It has also been circulating in French.\n\nTrump did not pronounce his counterpart\u2019s name or mention \u201cancient Rome\u201d during the October 16, 2019, bilateral meeting where the picture of the interpreter was taken, according to the official transcript of the conversation. The interpreter\u2019s facial expressions could not have been a reaction to these words since Trump did not mention them at this meeting.\n\nHe did pronounce Mattarella\u2019s name correctly, albeit with an American accent, at the beginning of a press conference held on the same day.\n\nIn his introductory speech, he also said that \u201cthe United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years to Ancient Rome. Over the centuries, the Italian people have blessed our civilization with magnificent works of art, science, philosophy, architecture and music.\u201d\n\nThis sentence has been taken out of context to imply that the US president claimed that both countries \u201chave been allies since Ancient Rome,\u201d a time when the United States didn\u2019t exist yet as a country.", "lang": "en"}
