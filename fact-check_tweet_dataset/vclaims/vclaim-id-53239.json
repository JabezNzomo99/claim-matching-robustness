The video appeared to have been uploaded to a video-sharing blog platform.\n\nClapper did not say what the video caption claimed: He did not \u201cout\u201d Obama as the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind the \u201cRussia hoax.\u201d Clapper instead aired his dismay at the turn of events in which Obama\u2019s successor, Donald Trump, had essentially compelled the government to launch an investigation into its own findings that the Kremlin had manipulated the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe original CNN video can be viewed by following this link. Here is a transcript of the exchange between Clapper and CNN host Jim Sciutto:\n\nSCIUTTO: As you know, the president now has sitting members of this government. You have the attorney general traveling the world now, meeting with U.S. intelligence partners, trying to find out, in his view, whether they participated in some sort of Obama administration-led effort to undermine President Trump in the last election here. You also know that John Durham, who is a former prosecutor, senior Justice Department official, he\u2019s pursuing his own investigation on the origins of that probe. Are you concerned that Barr\u2019s or Durham\u2019s investigation will find wrongdoing and seek to punish former intelligence officials? CLAPPER: Well, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think there was any wrongdoing. I think at the time all of us were trying to navigate a very, very difficult, politically fraught, highly-charged situation. I know for my part, my main concern was, were the Russians, and the threat posed by the Russians to our very political fabric. And the message I\u2019m getting from all this is, apparently what we were supposed to have done was to ignore the Russian interference, ignore the Russian meddling and the threat that it poses to us, and oh by the way, blowing off what the then-commander-in-chief, President Obama, told us to do, which was to assemble all the reporting that we could, that we had available to us and put it in one report that the president could pass on to the Congress and to the next administration. And, while we\u2019re at it, declassify as much as we possibly could to make it public. And that\u2019s what we did. And it\u2019s kind of disconcerting now to be investigated for having done our duty and done what we were told to do by the president.\n\nMultiple investigations have concluded that Russians interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that their activities were aimed at helping Donald Trump to get elected. Even though Trump repeatedly called those investigations \u201cwitch hunts,\u201d he appeared to admit in May 2019 to at least knowing that Russians had interfered in the election:\n\nTrump and his supporters, however, have undertaken an aggressive campaign to discredit investigations that have concluded the Russians interfered in the 2016 election with the aim of helping Trump win, to the extent that Trump has leveraged his own administration to investigate the inquiry that led to that finding.\n\nIn October 2019 President Trump was facing an impeachment inquiry over a phone call he had with the Ukrainian president, with Trump being accused of holding back key military aid in exchange for Ukraine\u2019s assistance in obtaining damaging information about a Trump political rival. But in that call, Trump also asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into a debunked conspiracy theory positing that the hacked Democratic National Committee server from 2016 was in Ukraine \u2014 a conspiracy theory that exculpates the Russians in the hacking operation.\n\nIn other words, the Obama administration conducted an investigation based on evidence which led to the conclusion that Russians had manipulated the 2016 presidential election. To say Obama was the \u201cmastermind\u201d of a \u201choax\u201d amounts to political propaganda favoring Trump while distorting reality.", "lang": "en"}
