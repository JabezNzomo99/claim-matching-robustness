FACTS: Mostly true - as far as we know, but there's more context needed. Three hostages returned to the U.S. from North Korea with Mike Pompeo in May 2018. It's also true there have been no nuclear tests since September 2017. North Korea claims it has dismantled part of its program. Similarly, North Korea has not conducted a ballistic missile test since September 2017. North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un claimed in April that the North no longer needs to test nuclear weapons or long-range missiles. However, the Defense Department assesses that the North still poses an \"extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security. As for the lack of missile testing, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the U.N. General Assembly in October that there is \"no way\" North Korea would get rid of its nuclear arsenal because it does not trust Washington, a conclusion shared by DNI Dan Coats. {\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"ClaimReview\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-fact-checking-trump-state-of-the-union-address-2019-02-04-live-updates/#post-update16\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"CBS News\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/\",\"sameAs\":[\"https://twitter.com/cbsnews\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News\"]},\"claimReviewed\":\"Our hostages have come home (from North Korea), nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months.\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"ratingValue\":4,\"bestRating\":5,\"worstRating\":1,\"alternateName\":\"Mostly true - as far as we know\"},\"itemReviewed\":{\"@type\":\"CreativeWork\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"url\":\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/\",\"image\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Donald_Trump_Pentagon_2017.jpg\",\"sameAs\":\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\"},\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-live-stream-donald-trump-democratic-rebuttal-live-updates/\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"name\":\"Trump delivers 2019 State of the Union address - live updates\"}}\n\nUnemployment rates for minorities and Americans with disabilities CLAIM: Unemployment for Americans with disabilities have also reached an all-time low. FACTS: Mostly True. According to the latest job report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for persons with a disability was 8.8 percent in January 2018, and has gone up to 9 percent as of January 2019. Overall, though, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities has significantly decreased since 2011, when it reached 15 percent. CLAIM: African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever. FACTS: True. The most recent jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics puts black unemployment at 6.8 percent. The December rate was 6.6 percent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the lowest ever was in May 2018 at 5.9 percent. For Hispanic-Americans, the unemployment rate hit 4.0 percent in January 2019, up from 4.3 percent in December 2018. For Asian Americans, the unemployment rate was 3.1 percent in January 2018, an increase from 2.1 percent in May 2018, the lowest on-record. {\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"ClaimReview\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-fact-checking-trump-state-of-the-union-address-2019-02-04-live-updates/#post-update15\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"CBS News\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/\",\"sameAs\":[\"https://twitter.com/cbsnews\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News\"]},\"claimReviewed\":\"Unemployment for Americans with disabilities have also reached an all-time low.\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"ratingValue\":4,\"bestRating\":5,\"worstRating\":1,\"alternateName\":\"Mostly true\"},\"itemReviewed\":{\"@type\":\"CreativeWork\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"url\":\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/\",\"image\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Donald_Trump_Pentagon_2017.jpg\",\"sameAs\":\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\"},\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-live-stream-donald-trump-democratic-rebuttal-live-updates/\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"name\":\"Trump delivers 2019 State of the Union address - live updates\"}} {\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"ClaimReview\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-fact-checking-trump-state-of-the-union-address-2019-02-04-live-updates/#post-update15\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"CBS News\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/\",\"sameAs\":[\"https://twitter.com/cbsnews\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News\"]},\"claimReviewed\":\"African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever.\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"bestRating\":5,\"worstRating\":1,\"alternateName\":\"True\"},\"itemReviewed\":{\"@type\":\"CreativeWork\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"url\":\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/\",\"image\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Donald_Trump_Pentagon_2017.jpg\",\"sameAs\":\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\"},\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-live-stream-donald-trump-democratic-rebuttal-live-updates/\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"name\":\"Trump delivers 2019 State of the Union address - live updates\"}}\n\nCLAIM: 1 in 3 women migrants is sexually assaulted on the journey north. FACTS: This is challenging to judge, and there may not be enough data to fully represent the facts. \"The percentage of women who have been sexually abused or assaulted is all over the place, since there is no single representative sample of all the women who cross Mexico to reach the United States,\" Nestor P. Rodriguez, a sociology professor and a research associate of the Population Research Center at the University of Texas, told PolitiFact in January about this particular claim. There is a report, however, that gives a \"snapshot in time\" of a select population of people, and it does appear to reflect what the president is likely talking about. A 2017 Doctors Without Borders report found \"nearly one third\" of women had been sexually abused during their journeys, and that was based on a review of the 2015 medical data of of more than 400 migrants in facilities where migrants seek assistance. Doctors Without Borders did not use the term sexual assault, but sexual abuse, to describe various types of violence against women and men. The report is careful to point out in its methodology that its data demonstrates the \"harrowing realities faced by many people on the route north,\" but \"these interviews are not necessarily representative\" of the entire migrant population traveling through Mexico. {\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"ClaimReview\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-fact-checking-trump-state-of-the-union-address-2019-02-04-live-updates/#post-update9\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"CBS News\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/\",\"sameAs\":[\"https://twitter.com/cbsnews\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News\"]},\"claimReviewed\":\"One in three women migrants is sexually assaulted on the journey north.\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"ratingValue\":-1,\"bestRating\":-1,\"worstRating\":-1,\"alternateName\":\"May not be enough data.\"},\"itemReviewed\":{\"@type\":\"CreativeWork\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"url\":\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/\",\"image\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Donald_Trump_Pentagon_2017.jpg\",\"sameAs\":\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\"},\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-live-stream-donald-trump-democratic-rebuttal-live-updates/\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"name\":\"Trump delivers 2019 State of the Union address - live updates\"}}\n\nCLAIM: We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO -- but now we have secured a $100 billion dollar increase in defense spending from NATO allies. FACTS: This is accurate. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said President Trump's tough talk has ultimately strengthened the 70-year-old alliance by leading member nations to contribute tens of billions of additional dollars to ensure their own security. In all, Stoltenberg continued, \"by the end of next year, NATO allies will add hundred - 100 billion extra U.S. dollars toward defense. So we see some real money and some real results. And we see that the clear message from President Donald Trump is having an impact.\" {\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"ClaimReview\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-fact-checking-trump-state-of-the-union-address-2019-02-04-live-updates/#post-update8\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"CBS News\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/\",\"sameAs\":[\"https://twitter.com/cbsnews\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News\"]},\"claimReviewed\":\"We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share...we have secured a $100 billion dollar increase in defense spending from NATO allies.\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"bestRating\":5,\"worstRating\":1,\"alternateName\":\"This is accurate.\"},\"itemReviewed\":{\"@type\":\"CreativeWork\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"url\":\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/\",\"image\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Donald_Trump_Pentagon_2017.jpg\",\"sameAs\":\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\"},\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-live-stream-donald-trump-democratic-rebuttal-live-updates/\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"name\":\"Trump delivers 2019 State of the Union address - live updates\"}}\n\nCLAIM: In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom -- a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started. FACTS: Partially true. On jobs -- in 2017 and 2018, the U.S. economy added 4.8 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Counting the months after the election, but before Mr. Trump took office, the figures do add up to 5.3 million. Because jobs figures are very late to respond to economic data, most economists don't give a particular administration credit for job creation until a month or two into the term. MANUFACTURING JOBS: A little short of true. Between January 2017 when Mr. Trump took office and January 2019, at least according to preliminary numbers for January 2019, the number of manufacturing jobs increased by 454,000. That is slightly lower than the president's figure. It is accurate that under President Obama's administration, the number of manufacturing jobs decreased by roughly 200,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. {\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"ClaimReview\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-fact-checking-trump-state-of-the-union-address-2019-02-04-live-updates/#post-update5\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"CBS News\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/\",\"sameAs\":[\"https://twitter.com/cbsnews\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News\"]},\"claimReviewed\":\"e have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs.\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"ratingValue\":4,\"bestRating\":5,\"worstRating\":1,\"alternateName\":\"Partially true.\"},\"itemReviewed\":{\"@type\":\"CreativeWork\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"url\":\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/\",\"image\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Donald_Trump_Pentagon_2017.jpg\",\"sameAs\":\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\"},\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-live-stream-donald-trump-democratic-rebuttal-live-updates/\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"name\":\"Trump delivers 2019 State of the Union address - live updates\"}}\n\nCLAIM: Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. FACTS: This is mostly true. Through January, average hourly wages grew 3.2 percent from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They rose an even stronger 3.4 percent for non-managers, who represent the large majority of the U.S. workforce. That represents the fastest rate of wage growth in nearly a decade (not \"in decades\"), and is a sign that the economic expansion is finally reaching lower-paid and lower-skilled workers. But it's far lower than the pay growth seen in prior economic recoveries. At the peak of the previous two economic expansions, in 2000 and 2007, average workers' wages grew between 4 and 4.5 percent annually. {\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"ClaimReview\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-fact-checking-trump-state-of-the-union-address-2019-02-04-live-updates/#post-update2\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"CBS News\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/\",\"sameAs\":[\"https://twitter.com/cbsnews\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News\"]},\"claimReviewed\":\"Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"ratingValue\":4,\"bestRating\":5,\"worstRating\":1,\"alternateName\":\"This is mostly true.\"},\"itemReviewed\":{\"@type\":\"CreativeWork\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"url\":\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/\",\"image\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Donald_Trump_Pentagon_2017.jpg\",\"sameAs\":\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\"},\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-live-stream-donald-trump-democratic-rebuttal-live-updates/\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"name\":\"Trump delivers 2019 State of the Union address - live updates\"}}\n\nCLAIM: The United States is now the #1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world. FACTS: This is accurate. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Short-Term Energy Outlook from September, the United States became the number one crude oil producer in the world last year. U.S. crude oil production exceeded that of Saudi Arabia for the first time in more than two decades in February 2018, and surpassed Russia in June and August 2018 for the first time since February 1999. The U.S. surpassed Saudi Arabia to become the top petroleum producer in 2013, and has continued to hold to that trend. The United States has been the number one producer of natural gas since 2009, when it surpassed Russia to claim the top rank. {\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"ClaimReview\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-fact-checking-trump-state-of-the-union-address-2019-02-04-live-updates/#post-update1\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"CBS News\",\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/\",\"sameAs\":[\"https://twitter.com/cbsnews\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News\"]},\"claimReviewed\":\"The United States is now the #1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"bestRating\":5,\"worstRating\":1,\"alternateName\":\"This is accurate.\"},\"itemReviewed\":{\"@type\":\"CreativeWork\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Donald Trump\",\"url\":\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/\",\"image\":\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Donald_Trump_Pentagon_2017.jpg\",\"sameAs\":\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\"},\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/2019-state-of-the-union-live-stream-donald-trump-democratic-rebuttal-live-updates/\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-05\",\"name\":\"Trump delivers 2019 State of the Union address - live updates\"}}", "lang": "en"}
