Bowe Bergdahl.\n\nHe is not and there is no way that he could be.\n\nThe image reportedly was tweeted by the man in the photo on March 15 and not one of the five Taliban prisoners. We say reportedly because the original tweet has since been removed. However, we can use news accounts to piece together what happened -- and why this image is not of the Taliban prisoners.\n\nFor starters, the five Taliban officials were released May 31, 2014, more than two months after the image was first released.\n\nTha man who originally tweeted the image goes by the name Abdurahman. Abdurahman came from Iraq and lived in Holland for 10 years before returning to fight in Syria and Iraq. The image was the source of , a major Dutch newspaper, on March 17. The article identifies the man in the image as Khalid K. from Almere, Netherlands.\n\nAlthough the photo itself is no longer available on the Web, the description in the Volkskrant article matches the image in Nugent\u2019s post. An American blog post from March 23 leaves no doubt the images are the same. The site links back to the Volkskrant and includes the photo.\n\nOn April 17, Live Leak, a British-based image and video sharing website, carried an entry with the photo. The headline was, \" (sic).\"\n\nThe image returned recently with people claiming it was Mohammad Fazl, one of the five Taliban prisoners swapped in exchange for Bergdahl. The urban myth website Snopes reviewed the revival of the disturbing photo on June 10. It noted that the image had appeared many times on Facebook with the claim that the man was \"Mohammad Fazi (sic), just one of those great terrorists that this administration traded for the deserter. He seems like a really proud terrorist in this photo. I sure hope everyone feels safer knowing this guy is now free.\"\n\nWithout using Mohammed Fazl\u2019s name, Nugent apparently borrowed much from such posts. Fazl is a former Taliban deputy defense minister, one of the five men released from Guantanamo.\n\nWe contacted Nugent\u2019s office for comment and did not hear back.\n\nNugent said a man squatting behind five heads had been set free by President Barack Obama to secure the freedom of an American soldier. The photo first appeared in mid March, two months before the prisoner swap.\n\nNugent had plenty of opportunity to learn that the photo was not of one of the five released prisoners. He posted it two days after the connection to the Guantanamo detainees had been debunked.\n\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
