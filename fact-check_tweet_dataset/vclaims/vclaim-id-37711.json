{"title": "Is This Fox Suckling Baby Koalas Orphaned by Wildfires?", "subtitle": "A viral video was heartwarming enough without the wildly false framing added to it.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-01-27T12:57:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-37711", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fox-feeding-koalas/", "vclaim": "In January 2020, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the authenticity of a viral video that some claimed showed a mother fox suckling koala joeys caught up in Australian bushfires during late 2019 and early 2020.\n\nFor example, on Jan. 25, the Facebook page \u201cDid You Know\u201d posted the 30-second clip, along with the caption, \u201cMama fox feeding Baby koalas who got orphaned in the bushfire.\u201d\n\nOn the same date, the video was posted to YouTube by \u201cLet\u2019s Make It Viral,\u201d along with the headline, \u201cA fox allows itself to feed koala babies in Australia,\u201d and a caption that read \u201cMama Fox feeds milk to baby Koalas in viral video from Australia. This is motherhood.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a Facebook posted a widely shared link to that YouTube video, along with the following caption \u201cMother wisdom \u2026 Mama Fox feeds milk to baby Koalas in viral video from Australia. A beautiful reminder that there is no others. We are all one if we open our heart enough to feel it.\u201d\n\nAgain on Jan. 25, the news site India Today published an article with the headline \u201cMama Fox Feeds Milk to Baby Koalas in Viral Video From Australia. This is Motherhood, Says Twitter.\u201d (The story was based on a version of the video posted by one Twitter account, which itself was derived from an earlier clip on Twitter.)\n\nIn reality, the video showed a fox feeding fox cubs, not koala joeys, and it bore no connection whatsoever with recent Australian wildfires. The video was recorded in 2009 and first posted online in 2014 by a nature photographer based in Montr\u00e9al, Canada \u2014 10 years and 10,000 miles from the context falsely provided by the sources mentioned above.\n\nIndia Today subsequently deleted its story and later posted a fact check about the episode, while the two aforementioned Twitter accounts also deleted their tweets. But as of Jan. 27, the inaccurately captioned versions of the video shared by \u201cDid You Know?\u201d and \u201cAngell Dear\u201d on Facebook, as well as the YouTube video posted by \u201cLet\u2019s Make it Viral,\u201d all remained online.\n\nThe same video has been shared by various accounts on several occasions in recent years. In 2018, a YouTube user posted it along with the claim it showed a fox suckling young monkeys, and in 2016 three separate users claimed the fox was feeding baby bears.\n\nThe earliest version we found was posted to Facebook on Dec. 26, 2014, by the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois nature photographer Luc Durocher:\n\nWriting by email, Durocher told Snopes he captured the video at precisely 7:02 a.m. on April 1, 2009. He told us the scene played out on Notre Dame Island at Parc Jean-Drapeau in the city of Montr\u00e9al, where Durocher lives.\n\nOn his YouTube channel, Durocher has posted several similar videos showing a fox suckling or playing with her cubs. That footage shows the infants from various angles, making it clear they are indeed foxes, and not from any other species:\n\nDurocher appears to be a rather prolific nature photographer and has posted multiple photographs of foxes and cubs, among many other animals, to his Flickr and PBase accounts, over the years. After being contacted by Snopes on Jan. 27, 2020, he re-posted his now decade-old video on Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
