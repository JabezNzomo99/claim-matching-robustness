Where are his accomplices? Are they honest men of Allah? What was the motive behind this murder and who are these people? This needs to come out in front of the country.)\u201d\n\nOn October 8, Bandhu Prakash Pal, his pregnant wife Beauty and 8-year-old son were found dead in their house at Jiaganj in Murshidabad district. While BJP claimed that Pal was an RSS worker, the victim\u2019s family has denied affiliation with any political group. Furthermore, the initial police investigation discovered personal enmity as the motive behind the murder.\n\nThe photograph circulated online has nothing to do with the Murshibadbad triple murder case. The image was uploaded in June by a Bangladeshi resident Mehedi Hasan Rasel. The man in a skull cap is his father.\n\nRasel is one of the 10 accused in the murder of second year engineering student, Abrar Fahad, in Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology (Buet). \u201cAbrar Fahad, 22, who was allegedly targeted after he criticised the government in a Facebook post, was found dead at his university halls of residence in Dhaka on Monday,\u201d reports The Guardian. It was claimed that the attackers were linked to the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), an influential student wing of prime minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s Awami League.\n\nThe murder took place in the early hours of October 7. The Daily Staridentified Rasel as the general secretary of Buet BCL.\n\nAccording to News18, \u201cAs part of the probe, a team of police officers on Saturday morning raided a house in Hooghly\u2019s Rampurhat area and picked up a person. Another, identified as Shoubhik Bhowmik, was detained from Suri in Birbhum.\u201d\n\nA report by The Indian Express says, \u201cPal\u2019s relatives have accused Souvik Banik, a resident of Rampurhat town in Birbhum district, of being involved in the crime. According to police sources, Banik has a history of duping people after taking money from them in the name of business investments and chain marketing systems.\u201d\n\nThe police have detained a total of four persons for interrogation, however, no arrests have been made. They received some information about financial dealings but are yet to confirm the same, reported ANI.\n\nAn image of a murder accused in Bangladesh, posing with his father, was falsely linked to the Murshidabad triple murder case.", "lang": "en"}
