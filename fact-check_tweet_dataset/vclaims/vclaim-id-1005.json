There are different versions of the posts, but most refer to the claim that the community will add the letter P to the acronym LGBT.\n\nExamples can be seen here, here and bit.ly/3gyvqKs .\n\nLGBTQ is an acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning and/or queer. The community has been wrongfully associated with pedophiles in the past. It has been widely reported that this link is untrue and offensive. (See here and here )\n\nThe LGBTQ community does not condone \u201cpedosexuals\u201d and no groups have shared that they do. These claims are false.\n\nA spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights organization working to achieve LGBTQ equality, told Reuters via email: \u201cThe LGBTQ movement absolutely rejects any suggestion that our community is linked to non-consensual interpersonal behaviors.\u201d\n\nA common iteration of the claim shows a post with a poster that includes the acronyms for LGBT and adds the letter \u201cP\u201d at the end, allegedly standing for \u201cpedosexuals\u201d. The shared post comes from a now-suspended Twitter account called @EqualLuv4All, suspended for violating Twitter\u2019s rules. An archived version of the post, dating to April 1, 2017, can be found ( here , here ). It is unclear if this was posted by the account as an April fool\u2019s joke.\n\nSnopes reported in 2017 that the graphic appears to stem from a 4chan misinformation campaign from 2016 ( here ).\n\nGLAAD, an organization that works for acceptance of the LGBTQ community through media ( www.glaad.org/ ), told Reuters via email: \u201cThis flyer first appeared on social media years ago and is not from an LGBTQ group. No LGBTQ organization has condoned pedophilia or advocated for a \u201cP\u201d to be added to the acronym in support of pedophiles. There is a long-standing, homophobic and transphobic tactic of inaccurately comparing LGBTQ people to pedophiles and being LGBTQ to pedophilia. It\u2019s debased and vile. It pains me to have to clarify that no, the LGBTQ community does not embrace pedophilia, and LGBTP is not an acronym used or supported by the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nAnother post shows a digitally edited graphic that reads \u201cLove is love\u201d with the words \u201cnot race, not age, not religion\u201d ( here ). The screenshot has been edited to appear like the popular page LGBT News posted it. This post is false, and was never posted by LGBT News ( www.nostraightnews.com/ , www.facebook.com/NEWSLGBT ).\n\nLGBT News told Reuters via email: \u201cA poor Photoshop attempt [\u2026] this image is all over the internet with different names attached to it, various age groups etc. We are against any and all forms of Pedophilia obviously. Whoever is spreading these images are trolls and haters trying to give the LGBT community a bad name. We meet them often in our inbox and in the comments.\u201d\n\nFalse. The LGBTQ community in no way supports \u201cpedosexuals\u201d and the letter \u201cP\u201d has not been added to the acronym.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
