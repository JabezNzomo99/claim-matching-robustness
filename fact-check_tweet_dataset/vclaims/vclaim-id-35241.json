They show nominal hourly earnings rose 3.1% in January from a year earlier.\n\nBut the operative word here is nominal, which means not adjusted for changes in the cost of living. Once you factor in inflation, the picture changes drastically. And far from representing a \u201cblue collar boom\u201d \u2013 as the president put it in his State of the Union address \u2013 the real, inflation-adjusted data show most U.S. workers have not benefited from the growing economy.\n\nAs an economist who studies wage data, I think it\u2019s paramount that we take a step back and look at what the data really show.\n\nThe effect of inflation and fringes\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics comes out with two sets of data on wages.\n\nBusiness journalists and financial markets tend to focus on the monthly data. These figures are only reported in nominal or current terms because the inflation data doesn\u2019t come out until later.\n\nA more complete set of wage and pay data is reported quarterly. The latest release came out in December for the third quarter. These figures are not only adjusted for inflation but also include fringe benefits, which account for just under a third of total compensation.\n\nAt first blush, it makes sense to focus primarily on the first set. Newer data is, well, newer, and market participants and companies prefer the latest information when making decisions about investments, hiring and so on.\n\nBut the effect of inflation means that the same US$1 bill buys less stuff over time as prices increase.\n\nFrom December 2016 to September 2019, nominal wages rose 6.79% from $22.83 to $24.38. But after factoring in inflation, average wages barely budged, climbing just 0.42% in the period.\n\nIncorporating fringe benefits into the picture adds another wrinkle.\n\nThe inflation-adjusted or real value of fringe benefits, which include compensation that comes in the form of health insurance, retirement and bonuses, declined 1.7% in the three-year period.\n\nAltogether, that means total real compensation slipped 0.22% from the end of 2016 to September 2019.\n\nOf course, workers in different sectors have fared differently. The Trump administration has singled out manufacturing workers \u2013 who it says are the main beneficiaries of its trade war and other policies intended to support the sector \u2013 as having benefited from a \u201cblue collar boom\u201d in wages.\n\nThe nominal data for manufacturing workers hardly support a boom but they do show an increase of 2.22% since Donald Trump took office.\n\nThe adjusted data, however, make it look more like a bust, with wages plunging 3.88% in the period. And, again, the situation is worse when we add in fringe benefits, which brings the decline to 4.33%.\n\nSo next time you read a story about a rise in pay, try to see if it reports the wage data in nominal or real terms, and if it includes fringe benefits too. If it\u2019s only nominal wages, the numbers may mean a lot less than they seem.\n\n[Get the best of The Conversation, every weekend. Sign up for our weekly newsletter.]", "lang": "en"}
