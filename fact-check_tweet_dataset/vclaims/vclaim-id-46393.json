The Trump campaign says it didn\u2019t post the ad, and Craigslist has removed it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has scheduled his first campaign rally since the COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to large-scale gatherings. Trump\u2019s last rally was on March 2 in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThe president is anticipating a large crowd at the rally planned on June 20 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He recently told reporters, \u201cwe\u2019re either close to or over one million people wanting to go.\u201d\n\nIn the days ahead of the June rally, an ad was posted on Craigslist in Tulsa, saying: \u201cExcited and enthusiastic MINORITY Actors and Actresses needed to hold signs at event in Tulsa.\u201d It went on to say, \u201cThis may be applied towards community service if necessary (in lieu of payment).\u201d\n\nThe map accompanying the ad showed the location of the BOK Center, where the rally is to be held, and listed June 20 as the date of the event. The arena has a capacity of about 19,000.\n\nWhile the ad didn\u2019t specifically mention the Trump rally, the intended message was clear to social media users, who shared screenshots of the post with comments that said, \u201c100% real Trump Craig\u2019s List ad looking for \u2018MINORITY ACTORS\u2019 to come to Lumpy Covid Tulsa rally on Saturday\u201d and \u201cThey are HIRING MINORITY ACTORS to pretend to be TRUMP SUPPORTERS!!!\u201d\n\nBut the ad was not placed by the Trump campaign, according to campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh.\n\nMurtaugh tweeted a copy of one such claim with this statement: \u201cThis, obviously, is fake, and a recurring lie the trolls roll out a lot.\u201d\n\nThe ad was posted anonymously, with no information about the person or organization who created it.\n\nThe original ad has been taken down and replaced with a note explaining that it was \u201cflagged for removal.\u201d\n\nCraigslist did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found here.\n\nMurtaugh, Tim (@TimMurtaugh). \u201cThis, obviously, is fake, and a recurring lie the trolls roll out a lot.\u201d Twitter. 15 Jun 2020.\n\n\u201cThis posting has been flagged for removal.\u201d Tulsa.Craislist.org.
