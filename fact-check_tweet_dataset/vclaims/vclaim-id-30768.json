The claim is false; the video has circulated online since 2017 -- some three years before the protests against the citizenship law broke out; a Congress spokesperson told AFP that the footage actually shows attendees at a religious funeral service for a party member in Manipur in 2017.\n\nThe video was shared in this Facebook post on January 17, 2020. It has since been viewed more than 470,000 times and shared over 26,000 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi caption translates to English as: \"All the women are receiving money for freedom from Congress workers on the spot\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post was shared two days after an unverified video, alleging female participants at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh protest demonstration were being paid 500 rupees per day to protest, was shared by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's head of social media Amit Malviya.\n\nHundreds of grandmothers, housewives and students have been sittting and sleeping across the main road in the Shaheen Bagh district of Delhi, fighting the country's new citizenship law. Here is an AFP report on the situation.\n\nThe new law, approved December 2019, was spearheaded by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nAFP has debunked multiple pieces of disinformation about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) \u2013 for example, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim about footage showing women queueing to receive payment is another example of content being shared in a misleading context.\n\nThe video was also published alongside the same claim here, here, here and here on Facebook and here, here and here on Twitter.\n\nA reverse Google image search of keyframes extracted from the video using InVID, a digital verification tool, found the same clip published here on YouTube on March 2, 2017, nearly three years before protests began against India\u2019s new citizenship law.\n\nThe video\u2019s description alleges that the footage shows Congress party workers \u201cbribing voters with money\u201d in Manipur.\n\nHowever, Congress told AFP that the video shows a religious rite at a funeral in 2017 for a party member in Manipur.\n\n\u201cDistributing money on deaths or marriages is a part of rituals in Manipuri culture, but this is unfortunate that the video has been circulated to claim that the Congress is bribing the people for anti-CAA protests,\u201d Ningombam Bupenda Meitei, a party spokesperson from Manipur, said by phone on January 21, 2020.\n\nPeople in the video can also be heard speaking Meitei, the local language of Manipur, and several are wearing Congress flags and apparel.", "lang": "en"}
