The 89-year-old discussed the #MeToo movement, career highlights and dished on his political views in a revealing interview with the Wall Street Journal, and it turns out Mike Bloomberg has the actor\u2019s support. \u2018The best thing we could do is just get Mike Bloomberg in there,\u2019 Eastwood told the outlet.\u201d\n\nActor and director Clint Eastwood, a longtime supporter of Republican candidates, appeared to back Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg for president and criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s behavior in office in an interview published in The Wall Street Journal Friday. \u201cThe best thing we could do is just get Mike Bloomberg in there,\u201d the Hollywood conservative said of the former New York mayor, according to the Journal. Eastwood told the newspaper that he approves of \u201ccertain things\u201d that Trump has done as President, without going into further detail. He said, however, that he wishes Trump would behave \u201cin a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names,\u201d the Journal reported. Similar reports were published by USA Today, Newsweek, the Daily Beast and WBMA. Those articles accurately reported a statement attributed to Eastwood in a Wall Street Journal interview published on Feb. 21, 2020. The following is the relevant section of that article: As for the domestic political scene, Mr. Eastwood seems disheartened. \u201cThe politics has gotten so ornery,\u201d he says, hunching his shoulders in resignation. He approves of \u201ccertain things that Trump\u2019s done\u201d but wishes the president would act \u201cin a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names. I would personally like for him to not bring himself to that level.\u201d As he drives me back to my hotel, he expresses an affinity for another former mayor: \u201cThe best thing we could do is just get Mike Bloomberg in there\u201d [Emphasis added]. To say that the \u201cbest thing we could do\u201d would be to elect a particular candidate is, without doubt, an expression of support and preference for that candidate\u2019s election as president. Eastwood did not merely say he would find Bloomberg\u2019s election tolerable, he presented it as the best possible outcome. As such, the news articles highlighted above accurately reported what the director had said. Eastwood may, in the future, modify or add nuance to those remarks, or he might retract or reinforce them. However, his expression of support in the February 2020 interview for Bloomberg\u2019s election was undeniable. It was also relatively significant. Eastwood, who described himself as a libertarian in the Journal interview, expressed a preference for Trump\u2019s election in 2016 over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, although he added that that choice was \u201ctough.\u201d He was a prominent critic of former President Barack Obama and took part in the Republican National Convention in 2012. Although Bloomberg\u2019s policies place him to the ideological right of some of his Democratic primary rivals, and he was in the past elected as New York mayor on Republican and Independent platforms, he is still running as a Democrat in 2020. Eastwood\u2019s expression of a preference for a Democratic candidate, over the Republican president he supported four years earlier, was a significant shift by a public figure who is particularly widely admired among right-leaning Americans.", "lang": "en"}
