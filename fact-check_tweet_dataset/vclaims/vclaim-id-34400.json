This quote does not appear in any of the six leaked documents.\n\nNo such statement is issued by the United States negotiators, nor is the sale of any NHS assets discussed in this context. As we\u2019ve written before, the documents show UK and US negotiators discussing a large number of trade-related issues, most of which are not linked to healthcare. They do cite US negotiators bringing up the issue of pharmaceutical patents and drug pricing, though they do not give an indication of the extent to which UK negotiators agreed with the US position.\n\nThe first instance of this claim we could find was on Twitter from the 27 November, the same day the leaked documents received wide coverage in the media following a Labour party press conference. The person who tweeted it also mentioned a reference to the quote in \u201cp238, sII, b in doc 4\u201d, but no such reference exists and the longest of the six documents only contains 144 pages.", "lang": "en"}
