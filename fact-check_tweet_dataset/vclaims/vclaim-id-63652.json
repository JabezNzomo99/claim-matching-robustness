Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the posts.\n\nClaim: Photos of Lord Ram being displayed on the billboards at New York Times Square. Fact: While it is true that a billboard at the New York Times Square has displayed the photo of Lord Ram and a 3D visualization of Ayodhya Ram Temple, the posted photos are fake. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the posted image was run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, a similar image was found in the search results. But, it is a mirror image of the posted photo and does not have Lord Ram\u2019s pictures on the billboards. The surroundings, the positions of people and cars are found to be same in both the photos. It was found that the original photo is being circulated on the internet at least since 2011. The same photo can be also found on multiple wallpaper websites. The print of the same photo can be found being sold on websites like eBay and Amazon, which credited the photo to Jose Fuste Raga.\n\nOn doing the reverse image search, a similar photo with the same surroundings and people at the same locations can be found in an article published by \u2018CNN Arabic\u2019 in 2019. In the original photo, it can be seen that, in the place of Lord Ram\u2019s photo, there is a photo of \u2018Amr Diab\u2019, a Middle Eastern artist. The \u2018Spotify Arabia\u2019 has also posted a similar picture from another angle. Also, the posted photo has a Twitter ID (\u2018IND_CYBORG\u2019) on it, which belongs to a user with the name \u2018ALLU\u2019. He describes himself as \u2018Sketch and Digital Artist\u2019 and a lot of edited photos can be seen on his profile. So, the posted image is also an edited photo.\n\nWhile the above two photos are fake, \u2018ANI\u2019 has reported that a billboard at the New York Times Square has displayed the photo of Lord Ram and a 3D visualization of Ayodhya Ram Temple. The actual photo can be seen below.\n\nTo sum it up, some of the photos shared as Lord Ram on the billboards at New York Times Square are edited and not real.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
