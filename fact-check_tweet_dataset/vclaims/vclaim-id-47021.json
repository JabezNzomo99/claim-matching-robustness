The sale of tobacco products has been banned in the country since a\n\nwas implemented on 27 March 2020 to better prepare the country to deal with\n\nMore than 600,000 people have\n\nto have the ban lifted, and tobacco producers have\n\nthe ban has encouraged the illegal cigarette trade.\n\nYusuf Abramjee, a former journalist and founder of advocacy group\n\n, is one of those opposing the ban. He has links to the tobacco industry, having previously been\n\nto post online about the tax revenue lost due to illicit cigarettes.\n\nHe is now claiming that the tobacco ban has caused a significant drop in tax revenue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a well known fact that South Africa is losing R35 million each and every day because of the ban on cigarettes,\u201d he said in a\n\nshared on Twitter on 29 April 2020, which has been viewed over 16,000 times.\n\nWe checked if there was evidence to support his claim.\n\nAbramjee told Africa Check that the figure was \u201cbased on the government's receipts across all tobacco products in 2018/19\u201d.\n\nfrom the national treasury he shared shows excise tax revenue on all tobacco products of just over R12.5 billion for that financial year. This produces an average of a little more than R34 million per day. This was the latest data available when he made his claim. (Note:\n\nMore recent data was released by the\n\n(SARS) the day after Abramjee made his claim. It shows that just under R14.5 billion was collected in excise taxes between\n\n. This makes for an average of around R40 million per day.\n\nDoes this reflect the amount of tax lost \u201ceach and every\u201d day during the lockdown?\n\n. He said the amount of tobacco excise tax collected varies throughout a year.\n\nA simple calculation suggests an average of R34 million was collected per day between April 2018 and March 2019. The figure was an average of R40 million for the financial year April 2019 to March 2020. These figures vary depending on when and how tobacco companies release their products into the market or sell to retailers.\n\nThe South African government announces tax increases in the annual\n\n, usually in February. Van Walbeek said tobacco companies declare most of their stock just before the announcement to avoid paying the higher rate.\n\n\u201cShortly after the tax increase they push very few cigarettes into the market.\u201d\n\nThis can be seen in the most recent figures. In May 2019, SARS reported collecting a daily average of R12 million in tobacco taxes. In January 2020, the month before the\n\n, they collected an average of R95 million per day.\n\nVan Walbeek said this variation would make Abramjee\u2019s claim less accurate in the first few months of the ban but it would grow more accurate as time passes. This is because the daily losses will get closer to the average the longer the ban is enforced.\n\nAfter Abramjee made his claim, South Africa\u2019s treasury released the\n\nfor the financial year running from April 2020 to March 2021. It showed that they anticipate collecting nearly R15 billion of tobacco excise taxes over the financial year.\n\nIn April 2020 \u2013 the first full month of the lockdown \u2013 SARS collected just under R936 milion, around R31 million per day. This is R36.2 million less than the daily average collected in April 2019 and R60.5 million less than the daily average collected in April 2018.\n\nSARS told Africa Check this revenue was collected for tobacco products manufactured in February and March 2020, before the ban was enforced.\n\nTaxes are not charged when a customer purchases a pack of cigarettes,\n\n, an economist of fiscal policies for health at the\n\n, explained to us. The tax is charged when the cigarettes are sold to retailers by the manufacturer.\n\n\u201cExcise taxes are charged at the factory gate, so any stockpiling by retailers or consumers could have softened the revenue blow in the very short term.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Abramjee is mostly correct, although tobacco tax collection varies significantly\n\n, claimed that the country loses \u201cR35 million each and every day\u201d due to the ban of tobacco sales enforced during the Covid-19 lockdown.\n\nThe data Abramjee had access to when he made the claim shows that R34 million in tobacco excise tax was collected on average every day in the last financial year. The actual amount collected each month varies significantly due to when tax is paid by manufacturers.\n\nData released after Abramjee made his claim showed that the daily amount of tobacco tax collected in the first full month of lockdown, April 2020, was down R36.2 million per day compared to April 2019 and R60.5 million per day compared to April 2018.\n\nAs the ban continues, monthly variation in tax collection will have less of an effect and Abramjee\u2019s estimate will become more accurate. We rate it \u201cmostly correct\u201d.\n\nNew numbers released by revenue service\n\n\n\n Two days after Abramjee made his claim it was that SARS had estimated under-recovery of roughly R400 million in \u201ccigarette\u201d excise taxes during the first 29 days of April. This is under-recovery of just under R14 million a day. \n\n\n\n Africa Check sent numerous requests to SARS seeking clarity on how this figure was calculated and what it included. The tax agency informed us that aside from publicly available tax information it would \u201cbe unable to provide any additional information until we have completed our own internal processes\u201d. \n\n\n\n Van Walbeek said he could \u201conly speculate\u201d on how SARS calculated the figure, as they would have access to information not publicly available. \n\n\n\n These figures were, however, not in the public domain when Abramjee made his statement.", "lang": "en"}
