Russia was \"not creating a Terminator, but artificial intelligence that will be of great practical significance in various fields,\u201d Rogozin countered.\n\nSaid Mashable: \"Yah. Sure. Because double fisting lethal hand cannons is the \u2018perfect\u2019 way to show how well a robot could, for example, delicately repair a faulty component on a space module.\"", "lang": "en"}
