Not, that's not true: This is a fake claim originally made by a website that is part of a network that runs satirical stories. It was copied from the satirical site with no mention of satire. This creates clickbait by fooling people who want to read about the legendary basketball player. Jordan is not a candidate.\n\nThis story, originally run by the satirical site wearethellod.com, is found in an article published by Daily News Updates on December 7, 2019, titled \"Michael Jordan is Running for US Senate as a Republican\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nMichael Jordan has been ruffling Democrat feathers ever since he came out in support of veterans over Colin Kaepernick. He left the Board of Directors of Nike, taking his anti-gravity juice for Air Jordans with him. The company lost $4 billion. Less than a month ago, Jordan changed his party affiliation. Democrats called him a racist. Now, to ice the cake of Democrat shame, Jordan will be running for the Senate in 2020 -- as a Republican.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story, which is clearly marked as satire on the original site where it was posted, claims:\n\nNo such sitting Democratic senator exists. Yet the story, which has been ripped off an stripped of all satirical references when republished on Daily News Updates, continues:\n\nJordan is far too classy to respond. He did release a picture of himself wearing his famous Confederate Flag boxer shorts under his basketball uniform at NCU. The caption was \"Heritage Not Hate.\" Several historians reminded him that his family was owned by southerners, which is not the same thing as being a southerner. The irony was lost somehow. This is great news for a party the Democrats call racist. It is a scientific fact that a party with a single black person in it cannot be racist. Period. Please get out there and cast your vote for Jordan in 2020, no matter what state you're from.\n\nAll of ALLOD's sites comes with some clear satire disclaimer, such as:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including wearethellod.com, bustatroll.org or bebest.website. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course fake news.\n\nThe story, already debunked by other outlets but still making its way on the internet, was mentioned by the site heavy.com, which wrote:\n\nOver the years, Michael Jordan has been very circumspect about his political and social beliefs, choosing to largely stay out of political debates. However, he's given thousands of dollars over the years to Democratic organizations, as documented by the federal campaign donation website, which lists a Michael J. Jordan as a donor, saying he is a majority owner in the Charlotte Bobcats. Jordan bought the Bobcats in 2010. His full name is Michael Jeffrey Jordan. The site lists 2012 donations by the Michael J. Jordan who is majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats to the Democratic Executive Committee of Florida; the Democratic Party of Virginia; the Democratic National Committee; the Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, and Colorado Democratic Parties. Other donations under the name Michael Jordan are impossible to prove because they don't list occupation.", "lang": "en"}
