The message was presented as an analysis of the recently concluded assembly election by this \u2018author\u2019. The complete message is as follows:\n\n*New York Times news\u2026\u2026.* \n\n*\u2026Few lessons from Indians voting pattern are clear*\n\n\u2013 Indian public does not understand Fiscal deficit & are not bothered whether it is 2.4% or 3.4%. They do not understand that subsidies & Freebees mean borrowing & borrowing have to be paid one day by someone.\n\nIndian public also not bothered about GDP rate it increasesed from 3.8 to 7.4 from last four years which is more then USA, UK , japan\u2026..\n\n\u2013 Indian public will always complain. If it is not about price of Onions or Thur Dal, it will be about Petrol or Diesel. They must get everything cheap but at the same time Farmers must get good price\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t ask Indian public to change old habits. It is Govt\u2019s job to change everything\n\n\u2013 Indian public is not bothered about fixing long term issues. They want it today. Not even today. NOW.\n\n-they intextualy vote as per cast pattern\u2026. Castisum is major enemy for Indian politics which divides indian youth from growth\u2026 And PaK and chine pramote castisum in India with help of there own native peoples because both directly depends on India for open market..GDP\u2026..\n\nIndian defence system are more stronger as compared to last five years and PaK and gulf countrys are not able to ruled on India\u2026thier for they fundings in billion to destroy Indian system and only Modi is fight against them\u2026\u2026but Indian don\u2019t know this..\n\nIf Mr. Modi continues fixing long term problems for remaining 5 months, he will loose 2019. A dead soldier can not do anything for country. He must live to comeback for next 5 years. Now he must become a politician for remaining 5 months. If Public wants cheap Petrol & Diesel give to them. If farmers want loan waiver, give it to them,\n\nThey don\u2019t know about sabka sath sabaka vikas\n\nWe advise to Mr. Modi will be to apply for 5 month\u2019s leave from being statesman & become politician. After 2019 victory back to being statesman because India can only grow under statesman Modi & not Politician Modi.\n\nThe message seeks to build a wave of sympathy for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party. It denigrates Indian citizens for having a \u201cshort memory and narrow vision\u201d, for failing to recognize the need to \u201cfix long term issues\u201d which PM Modi is successfully doing.\n\nRenuka Jain, who is followed on Twitter by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, posted this message on her Facebook page on December 14.\n\nSeveral individual users too have posted this message on their timelines.\n\nThe identical nature of the text in all these messages suggest that it has been uploaded from WhatsApp where it has been shared heavily.\n\nNO SUCH ARTICLE BY THENEW YORK TIMES\n\nThe write-up attributed to a New York Times author, not only doesn\u2019t specify the name of the author, but is also replete with spelling and grammatical errors. For example, the word \u2018increased\u2018 has been spelled as \u2018increasesed\u2018, \u2018their\u2018 is spelled as \u2018thier\u2018, \u2018promote\u2018 as \u2018pramote\u2018, and so on. This was the initial indicator that this was possibly a fake message that was being circulated.\n\nAlt News found that there is no such article on The New York Timeslisting out the contents of the viral message. A search on the website of the newspaper with the key words \u2018Narendra Modi\u2019 revealed that the most recent article about PM Modi is of December 11, when the result of the assembly elections was declared. Titled \u2018Modi\u2019s Party Is Trounced in India\u2019s \u2018Semifinal\u2019 Elections\u2019, the factors listed out in the article for the BJP\u2019s recent defeat do not even remotely match the contents of the viral message. Instead, the article talks of farmer distress, inflation and cow vigilantism as the causes of the defeat, among others.\n\nSuch messages extolling the virtues of PM Modi are not a new phenomenon. Earlier, Alt News had busted the myth about a bureaucrat claiming that PM Modi works 18-20 hours in single day. In another instance, Alt News had revealed how an emotional post praising PM Modi was falsely attributed to Arnab Goswami. Messages like these seek to inject credibility to false and motivated claims by appropriating the name of a globally renowned publication like The New York Times.", "lang": "en"}
