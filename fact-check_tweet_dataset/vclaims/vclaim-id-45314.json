(Sensitive content)\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found that the claim attached to it is fake.\n\nWhen we put it through Reverse Image Search, we found a Facebook post dated July 3, 2015, featuring the same image. Further, we found the same picture in a petition started four years ago on Change.org. The title of the petition read: \u2018Barbed wire killing animals and birds in India- Sukannya Kadyan\u2019. The description of the petition read: \u2018STOP barbed wiring around fields, which is being used to keep animals away but these practices are killing animals and birds, use alternatives, Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Act, 2015 also needs immediate attention because beef and its products doesn\u2019t have medicinal values.\u2019. NewsMobile could not independently verify the origin of the picture. But, the above information establishes that picture in question is old as it was already on the internet much before the cow was injured. Hence, the above information proves that the claim is fake.
