The claim is false; the video shows a festival in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe 18-second video shows people dancing on a sunny tree-lined street, with one of them waving an Indian flag next to a sound system.\n\nA Hindi song called \u201cLollipop Lagelu\u201d can be heard in the background; here is the song on YouTube.\n\nThe video has been shared thousands of times in multiple posts including this one published to Facebook on June 12, 2019, and viewed more than 320,000 times since.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates as: \u201cSee the result of organising the World Cup in London,\u201d referring to the ongoing ICC Cricket World Cup.\n\nHere is the official website of the cricket tournament, which is taking place in various locations in England and Wales, including London, between May 30 and July 14, 2019.\n\nIdentical clips have been shared elsewhere alongside similar claims, for example here and here on Twitter and here and here on YouTube.\n\nPawan Singh, the singer of \u201cLollipop Lagelu\u201d, also posted the video to his verified Instagram account here on June 12, 2019, with the caption: \u201cLondon World Cup during India Australia Match @gururandhawa #Lollypoplagelu #worldcup2019\u201d\n\nSingh\u2019s post has been viewed more than 50,000 times.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found a similar video published to YouTube here by a channel called Indian Berliner on June 9, 2019 with the title \u201cGermans Dancing on Indian Songs\u201d.\n\nThe one minute, 41 second YouTube video, embedded below, has a caption that says: \u201cCarnival of Cultures 2019\u201d:\n\nCarnival of Cultures, or Karneval der Kulturen, is an annual festival in Berlin to celebrate the city\u2019s cultural diversity. This year it was held between June 7 and June 10.\n\nHere is a municipal website with information about the festival. It says, in part:\n\n\u201cStreet parade on Sunday, 9 June 2019. Highlight of the Carnival of Cultures is the street parade on Pentecost Sunday in Kreuzberg where thousands of dancers, musicians and artists perform and about half a million people from all over the world line the streets.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between screenshots of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the clip on YouTube (R), with similar elements highlighted in green:\n\nKeyword searches on Youtube to find other videos from an Indian soundsystem at the 2019 Berlin Carnival of Cultures found this clip with the words \u201cBerlin Indiawaale\u201d in the title.\n\nThe words \"Berlin Indiawaale\" can also be made out on a white banner in the YouTube video embedded above, which corresponds with the clip in the misleading posts.\n\nThis is highlighted in the screenshot below:\n\nAFP also found another video here uploaded by Anja Arif on June 12, 2019 on Facebook with the words \u201cBerlin Indiawaale\u201d in the caption.\n\nThat video contains footage of the same truck with an identical banner, where the words can be read more clearly, as shown in the screenshot below:\n\nThis Facebook page by the name \"Berlin Indiawaale\" also exists. It is a Berlin-based cultural group.\n\nAFP contacted the page's manager, Tara B Jaan, who confirmed the video in the misleading post shows the Berlin Indiawaale truck on June 9, 2019 during the Carnival of Cultures.\n\nIn the YouTube video that corresponds with the video in the misleading Facebook post, a store front can be seen, as highlighted in the screenshot below:\n\nAFP found the same store, a game shop called Battlefield Berlin, on mapping website Mapillary here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the same store front on Mapillary:", "lang": "en"}
