The origin of the #Corona virus#\u2026)\u201d This video has been viewed over 41,000 times.\n\nOn January 30, @JithuShajiVar4 tweeted a two-minute 22-second video of the meat market and enquired, \u201cWhuan market. China, the origin of the #Corona virus\u2026 How unclean place? Then how the 2019 virus can be restricted?\u201d This video has been viewed over 6,000 times.\n\nAlt News also noticed that some social media users have shared a shorter 44-second version of the video as well. On February 3, Twitter user @PCVerma16shared the 44-second video and said, \u201cWhuan market. China, the origin of the #Corona virus\u2026 \u201d\n\nSimilarly, several Facebook and Twitter users have shared a video with the claim that it shows Wuhan market.\n\nThe video posted by @JithuShajiVar4 and Deepak Maurya begins with the phrase \u2018Pasar Extream Langowan\u2019 flashed on the screen. Using that as a clue, Alt News did a keyword search on YouTube and found the viral video. It was uploaded by Jerry Mewengkang in July 2019. The video\u2019s run time is 4:41 minutes.\n\nLangowan market is one of the tourist hubs in Indonesia\u2019s North Sulawesi province. According to a 2014 report by the Daily Mail, the market is known for \u2018exotic\u2019 food such as spit-roasted bats, battered snake, pickled rats and boar legs. Therefore the claim, that video is from Wuhan is false. Alt News also noticed that Wuhan is misspelt as Whuan in the viral posts.\n\nAs for the shorter videos, they are clipped from the four-minute viral video. The video shared by @PCVerma16 has been clipped at 3:53 minutes. While the video share by @JithuShajiVar4 shows the opening 2:22 minutes of the video.\n\nIn conclusion, the viral posts falsely claim that the meat market in the video is from Wuhan, China. However, the video shows Langowan market, Indonesia.This claim was also fact-checked by the Association for Financial Professionals (AFP) on January 24.
