No, the same old fake story which has been circulating since 2015 has been going viral again after being posted on the newest website of a network of Macedonian fake news sites we reported on last week.\n\nThis time the story appeared in an article published on December 1, 2018 on 'coolinfo24.com' titled \"Civil War Erupts In Sweden as Irate Swedes Burn Nine Muslim Refugee Centers to the Ground - coolinfo24.com\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nRefugee centers in Sweden are being burned to the ground in what appears to be a statement against the significant number of refugees the country has allowed in. The multiple arsons have all been at facilities which house or are slated to house immigrants. One could say that someone in Sweden is mad as hell and bringing fire and brimstone to the facilities that are to be used for refugees. Seven arson fires have occurred, all of which seem to be connected with immigrant centers.\n\nThe story is false and has been debunked several times since 2015:\n\nThe Swedes are fed up with the \"Muslim invasion\" in their country and have fought back with fire, according to a news account on Facebook. \"Civil war erupts in Sweden as irate Swedes burn nine Muslim refugee centers to the ground,\" states the headline in Pipo News, which linked to a similar 2015 article in JewsNews, a fake news website.\n\nWhat is more interesting is the website that published it this time: coolinfo24.com was launched just a few days according to WHOIS data:\n\nAccording to data collected through our Trendolizer engine it shares advertising codes with several sites in a huge network of other sites all registered in Macedonia. We wrote about that network and its latest tactics last week after an investigation in collaboration with Nieuwscheckers:\n\nQuite amazing they still manage to go viral with a three-year-old story.", "lang": "en"}
