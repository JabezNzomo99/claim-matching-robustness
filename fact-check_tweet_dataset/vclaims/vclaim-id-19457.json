The claim is false; the video has circulated online since December 2015 in media reports about members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) celebrating after completing their education training.\n\nThe video has been shared in this post uploaded to a Facebook page with nearly 250,000 followers on July 15, 2019.\n\nThe 28-second clip has been viewed more than 17,000 times.\n\nThe English-language text superimposed on the video states: \u201cNagpur headquarter after England won ICC World Cup 2019\u201d.\n\nNagpur is a central Indian city in the western state of Maharashtra. England beat New Zealand to win the 2019 International Cricket Council (ICC) Cricket World Cup on July 14, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nA journalist in AFP's Delhi bureau analysed the video. In the clip, a narrator can be heard saying in Hindi: \u201cIt is highly unlikely that you have seen RSS activists like this. These Swayamsevaks are dancing in their khaki shorts and white shirts, with black caps on their heads.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting to see the majority of these activists are either middle-aged or elderly. This video is shot from the RSS headquarters in Nagpur.\"\n\nThe RSS, or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, is a Hindu nationalist organisation headquartered in Nagpur; here is a report on the group by Indian news magazine India Today.\n\nThe same video has been viewed tens of thousands of times alongside a similar claim elsewhere on social media, such as here on Facebook and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has circulated since December 2015 in media reports about members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) celebrating after completing their education training.\n\nA logo for Hindi news channel India TV can be seen in the bottom right-hand corner of the video in the misleading post.\n\nAFP found the same clip beginning at the 19 second mark of this YouTube video uploaded by India TV on December 17, 2015:\n\nThe clip, entitled \u201cRSS Activist Seen Dancing Before Meeting in Nagpur\u201d, is accompanied by the same Hindi-language narration as heard in the video in the misleading post.\n\nA Google keyword search of \u201cRSS activists dance\u201d found the same clip beginning at the five second mark of this video published by Hindi news channel Aaj Tak on December 16, 2015.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the versions published by India TV (C) and Aaj Tak (R):\n\nAaj Tak published this report alongside screenshots of the video on December 17, 2015.\n\nPart of the report translates to English as: \u201cThe Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is known for its discipline, but some members were seen dancing in Nagpur after completing the third and final year of their education training.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
