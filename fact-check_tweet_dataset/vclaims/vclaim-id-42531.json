The claim likely stemmed from an August 2011 helicopter crash that killed 30 members of the U.S. military.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) reports that more than 2,300 U.S. service members have died in Afghanistan since October 2001. The March 12 post urges readers to honor Navy SEALs who allegedly died in the country the previous day.\n\n\u201cI am asking everyone to please take a moment of silence for the United States Navy Seal Team and their families,\u201d the post says. \u201cTheir helicopter was shot down yesterday in Afghanistan and they lost 30 members of the team. It would be nice to see this on everyone\u2019s page\u2026 even if it\u2019s only for an hour.\u201d\n\nMultiple Facebook users have shared the claim, despite no Navy SEALs perishing in Afghanistan on March 11. An internet search turned up no credible reports of 30 SEALs dying in an alleged March 11 incident. Neither the DOD nor the Department of the Navy have issued press releases.\n\nMedia organizations often report on the deaths of American soldiers in Afghanistan. If 30 Navy SEALs had been killed after their helicopter was shot down, it would have been covered by the media, yet no outlets reported on it.\n\nThe claim may have stemmed from a real incident that occurred on Aug. 6, 2011, when 30 American service members died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan\u2019s Wardak province. 17 of those who perished were Navy SEALs, according to the Navy press release.", "lang": "en"}
