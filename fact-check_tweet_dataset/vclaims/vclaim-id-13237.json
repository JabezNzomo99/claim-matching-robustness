The videos claim that people are converting to Islam especially after the shooting. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found one such video to be misleading. The video is old and it was being circulated on Facebook months before the mass shootings in Christchurch.\n\nA Facebook page 'Azamgarh Express' posted a video three days after Christchurch shootings. The video claims to be of a conversion ceremony which, the video says took place after Christchurch attacks.\n\nThe message written on the FB post in Hindi reads \"Poeple keep on converting to Islam after the New Zealand mosque attack. Inshallah to 49...49,000 people will accept Islam... you are welcome\"\n\nThe video had been viewed more than 11,000 times and had been shared 600 times till the time of writing this story.\n\nMany other Facebook pages like \"Muslim Express\" and \"Chanakya ke Guru\" also posted the same claim with the same viral video. The posts have been shared by thousands of users on Facebook.\n\nThe video shows a man in blue shirt and having a pony tail reciting verses in Arabic. He is guided by an Imam who hugs him after the recitation is over.\n\nTo verify, we used INVid to reverse search the key images of the viral video. Using Yandex image search we found that a screen grab from the video featured in an another video on a YouTube channel named 'Ethio Muslim tube channel'\n\n\"Welcome back our brother from Denmark\" were the words written on the screen grab.\n\nWe found a particular video when we searched YouTube with words \"conversion to Islam in Denmark\".\n\nThe video was found to have been posted 5 months ago by a YouTube channel \"BSL FUN 69 TV\"\n\nIt has the same viral video posted on Facebook pages.\n\nA Facebook page \"Converts to Islam\" posted this same viral video five months ago.\n\nThe caption says \"A Danish brother convert to Islam and pronounces the testimony of faith Shahadah\"\n\nThis viral video with the same caption was also posted by many Facebook users last year in the month of November. All these posts claim that the video was from Denmark.\n\nIndia Today cannot independently confirm the location of the video. But it is confirmed that this video has nothing to do with the recent mass shootings in Christchurch. This video has already been on social media since last year.", "lang": "en"}
