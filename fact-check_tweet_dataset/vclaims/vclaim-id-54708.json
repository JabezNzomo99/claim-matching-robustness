Overnight, it went viral \u2014 we were expecting a few hundred users to test our service, with most being friends and family. Instead, we are now crossing over 500,000 users within just a few days, and our service is still in beta,\u201d Garg told News 18.\n\nThe article also stated that \u2018Say Namaste\u2019 will be one of the participants in the innovation challenge hosted by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). However, it is not a government-endorsed app.\n\nThe above information proves that the viral message is misleading and the app is not launched by the Government of India.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
