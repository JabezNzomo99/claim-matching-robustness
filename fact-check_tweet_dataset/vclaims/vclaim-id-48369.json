Alt News found a Reddit post from September 2014 which carried the same image with the title, \u201cModi greeting Tumkur mayor (after leaving ISRO to launch that food park)\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, a tweet by one Rahul Kaushik also identified the woman as Geeta Rudresh, then mayor of Tumkur.\n\nAlt News was able to corroborate the same with a newspaper clipping published on September 25, 2014. The caption below the photograph stated that Metropolitan Mayor Geeta Rudresh met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his arrival in Tumkur on Wednesday for the inauguration of food park.\n\nIn conclusion, a photo of PM Modi showing respect to then-Mayor of Tumkur city was shared on social media with the false claim that he was bowing in front of Gautam Adani\u2019s wife, Priti Adani.", "lang": "en"}
