This claim was\n\nDoes Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, also account for the highest number of girls who are out-of-school globally? We graded the evidence.\n\n, the UN arm that focuses on the well-being of children, as the source of their claim.\n\nAccording to the country brief, while primary school enrollment has increased in recent years, \u201c\n\nNigeria still has 10.5 million out-of-school children - the world\u2019s highest number\u201d.\n\nAbout 60% of these are girls, the organisation noted.\n\nthat it was \"sad to note\" that Nigeria had 10.5 million children out-of-school. This, the BBC report added, \u201cwas the first time senior officials have admitted the size of the problem\u201d.\n\nthat the figure of 10.5 million came from UNESCO\u2019s Institute for Statistics database, using data from 2010.\n\nIt was however \u201cunclear\u201d where the girls\u2019 share of 60% came from as the institutes' data showed that it was 52% in 2010, the year for which it last has data on Nigeria, she said.\n\nfor out-of-school children refers to children of official primary school age (6 to 11 years) who are not enrolled in either primary or secondary school.\n\nUNESCO said they based the 2010 figure on enrollment statistics from Nigeria\u2019s education ministry. The age distribution was then estimated using\n\n, who is with the institute\u2019s education standards and methodology section, explained to Africa Check.\n\nIn 2014, the data agency revised the 2010 out-of-school figure for Nigeria from\n\n10.5 million to 8.7 million, Huebler said. This was\n\nbecause the UN Population Division had produced new population estimates for that year.\n\nOf these, 57% of the children were estimated to be girls, a total of close to 5 million.\n\ntold Africa Check that while it did not have publishable estimates for the out-of-school population for all countries (such as the DRC)\n\n, Nigeria is the country with the world\u2019s third largest population of primary school age. In 2015, this was estimated at 29.6 million, after that of India (127.5 million) and China (92.2 million).\n\n\u201cFor all 10 countries with the world\u2019s largest population of primary school age, from China at number 1 to Mexico at number 10, the out-of-school rate is known, and all countries have significantly lower out-of-school rates than Nigeria\n\nThere has been virtually no improvement\n\nin the out-of-school rate in Nigeria over the past 15 years, according to the institute\u2019s data. Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in the country in\n\nyielded primary out-of-school rates of 31.6%, 31.4% and 31.3% respectively, Huebler said.\n\n\u201cIn combination with a growing school-age population this would mean an increase in the absolute number of out-of-school children between 2003 and 2013,\u201d he added.\n\nHuebler said that the available evidence indicates that Nigeria does have the highest number of girls of primary school age out-of-school. But he added it \u201cis not known how many girls above primary age are out-of-school in Nigeria\u201d.\n\n27 million girls in both primary and secondary school\n\nwere out-of-school in India in 2013 -\n\nthe highest number globally according to the available UN data -\n\nthe country may well have a higher number of girls of all ages out-of-school than Nigeria.\n\nLagos. He told Africa Check that while factors like gender myths, religion and cultural beliefs affect the enrollment of girls, years of insurgency in Nigeria\u2019s northeast region and other unrest could have made the situation worse in the past few years.\n\n\u201cScholarships, feeding and the provision of girls' menstrual kits - as it is being experimented [with] now in South Africa - can help. More importantly, a lot of advocacy need to be put in place to help shatter wrong beliefs,\u201d he said\n\nConclusion: Lack of full data for Nigeria keeps us in the dark\n\nWhile making a case for a state of emergency in education in Nigeria, girls' education campaigner Malala Yousafzai said the country had the most out-of-school girls in the world.\n\nHer charity cited Unicef as the source of its data. The UN agency says 8.7 million children between 6 and 11 years old - not the 10.5 million cited in its country brief - are out-of-school, referring to data from the Institute of Statistics, the UN arm that monitors global education. Of these, close to 5 million were estimated to be girls.\n\nThe UN says that while it does not have usable data for all countries, the evidence it does have suggests Nigeria remains the country with the most out-of-school girls in that age group in the world.\n\nHowever, the body does not have data for girls above primary age who are out-of-school in Nigeria. In India, which has the highest number of out of school children globally according to available UN data, some 27 million girls in both primary and secondary school were out of school in 2013.\n\nGiven the lack of data for Nigeria, we rate the claim unproven.", "lang": "en"}
