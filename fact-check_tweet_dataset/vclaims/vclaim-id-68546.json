The footage is actually from California in 2015 when 202 skydivers from around the world set new world record for largest formation skydive.\n\nThe video has been repeatedly posted on social media, including here where it has been shared more than 300,000 times and viewed 11 million times in the 10 months since it was published by a Hindi-language Facebook page.\n\nThe video has also been shared by multiple other Facebook users, for example here and here, and on YouTube here.\n\nThe misleading Facebook posts have a caption in Hindi which says: \u201cWe are proud of the Indian Army. A land where courageous men like Maharana Pratap (a revered 16th century warrior king) are born. Army soldiers are sure to have valour running through their veins.\u201d\n\nThe official Facebook page of the Indian Army is tagged in the caption.\n\nThe footage is actually from September 28, 2015, when 202 skydivers from nearly 30 different countries set a new record above Southern California.\n\nThe jumpers grabbed each other\u2019s arms and legs and created a giant lattice-like configuration at some 7,000 feet.\n\nHere is footage of the original event on an Italian television channel\u2019s website.\n\nThe same video footage was also uploaded on Vimeo in 2015:\n\nHere are screenshots from the original 2015 video footage of the skydiving record and the footage used in the misleading Facebook post.\n\nThe skydivers are clearly wearing the same clothes and the ground underneath them is identical -- with a distinctive pattern of roads, fields, and mountains clearly identifiable in both.\n\nHere is another video of the 2015 event from a different angle, showing the same distinctive markers.\n\nThere were multiple media reports in 2015 covering the skydiving world record, for example here on ABC news and here on Global news Canada.", "lang": "en"}
