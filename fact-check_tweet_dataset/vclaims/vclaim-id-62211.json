Reportedly, the massive runoff into the Yangtze has led to concerns that the Three Gorges Dam will be overstressed beyond its capacity to withstand the inflow.\n\nThe unprecedented series of massive rainstorms that hit the Yangtze River basin, has led to a massive inflow of water, which is increasing stress for the dams of the region. The Three Gorges Dam is one of the most popular dams in the country. It is located near three scenic gorges along the Yangtze.\n\nIn light of this, a video is being circulated with the claim that it shows an incident of dam burst following heavy rain. In the three-minute and 47-second video, floodwaters are seen engulfing a street.\n\nThe claim is false. The video is of time when Tsunami hit Japan in 2011. A Reverse Image on Yandex search was done by breaking the video into individual frames using InVid.\n\nThe earthquake had caused the land to subside up to 1.2 m, resulting in additional flooding at high tide in some areas. More than 50,000 homes and buildings were destroyed by the tsunami, erasing a once-vibrant city centre, and much of its seaport and land transportation infrastructure was levelled. The Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011 began with a powerful earthquake off the northeastern coast of Honshu, Japan's main island. The tsunami had also set off a major nuclear accident at a power station along the coast.\n\nTherefore, a video from the tsunami that occurred in Japan in 2011 is being shared as a recent flood situation in China. \n\n\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.
