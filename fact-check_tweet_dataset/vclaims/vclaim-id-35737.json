In the video, he introduces himself as 'Ramesh Singh' and expresses his gratitude to the 'organiser' for distributing blankets to differently-abled persons.\n\nTowards the end, 'Ramesh Singh' is seen getting up from the wheelchair and walking away.\n\nThis video has been labelled as an Aam Aadmi Party and Bharatiya Janata Party propaganda, hinting that the event was staged and the people receiving blankets were pretending to be differently-abled.\n\nThe claim comes at a time when the Delhi Assembly elections 2020 are round the corner and are scheduled to be held on February 8. With the results to be announced on February 11, this video has been widely shared on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nAAP and BJP staging blanket distribution by coercing people to fake disability\n\nThe event has no connection to BJP or AAP organization.\n\nIn the video, in which Ramesh Singh is talking to the camera, a banner can be spotted with Hindi text which reads 'Digital Saksharta Sansthan (Translated from \u0921\u093f\u091c\u093f\u091f\u0932 \u0938\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928).'\n\n\n\nThere exists a Facebook profile by the name 'Sakshrta Sansthan', which is an NGO based out of Seohara, Uttar Pradesh. The same profile has shared the fake-news-busting-video of AbhiTak channel in which Ramesh Singh clarifies that the public has been misled and that he has a unique disability ID card.\n\nIn AbhiTak's report, Singh has displayed his proof of disability and said, \"There is some misunderstanding among the masses. I'm really disabled and I have proof. I have UD ID (Unique Disability ID) which states I've 40% disability.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking about the moment when he gets up from the chair, which was called out for being 'fake', Singh said, \"While receiving the gift, I was made to sit on the wheelchair. When I stood up, people who saw the video couldn't understand the nature of my disability.\"\n\nDigital Sakshrta Sansthan's Facebook account has uploaded several other videos from the event.\n\nA video uploaded on January 19 shows the full sequence of a woman receiving the blanket on a wheelchair, after being asked to sit, and then getting up.\n\nOn February 1, The Quint published a fact-check report, according to which Najam was the reporter on duty for Abhitak. While speaking to The Quint, Najam said, \"The man sitting on the wheelchair is Ramesh Singh and the one giving the blanket is Ravi Saini. AAP is not involved in this in any manner.\"\n\nThe report added that Saini is a part of the 'Digital Saksharta Sansthan' and Saini told The Quint that they had organised a programme to distribute 100 blankets to the differently-abled.\n\nRavi Saini has posted the local media reports of the event on Twitter.\n\nSpeaking to BOOM, Ravi Saini described himself as a businessman who works in close collaboration with the Ministry of Broadcast and Information Technology.\n\n\n\n\"I have no political affiliation, I am just a businessman who runs an NGO that helps the government in their programs such as e-literacy including setting up wi-fi in villages and rural areas. I don't belong to AAP or any political party. I work with the IT Ministry for my projects but there is no political involvement of me or my NGO,\" Saini explained.\n\nTherefore, social media's claims that the Aam Aadmi Party or the Bharatiya Janata Party distributed blankets to the people posing to be differently-abled for propaganda are false.\n\nCreating or sharing fake news is never justified. We have a responsibility to verify everything that we post on the internet. To ensure that our national debate is healthy and well-informed, each and every one of us has a responsibility of treating what we read with a pinch of salt, a spoonful of doubt, and a flood of research.\n\nAlso Read: Sambit Patra Shares Video Claiming AAP Leader Wants 'Sharia' When He Actually Said 'Zaria'", "lang": "en"}
