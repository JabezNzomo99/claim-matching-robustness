Kamala Harris' birth certificate shows that the document identified her race as \"Caucasian.\"\n\nOn Aug. 12, 2020, the Twitter account of Joseph Blakeney Brown Jr. \u2014 the American lawyer and television personality best known for the reality court show \u201cJudge Joe Brown\u201d \u2014 tweeted a purported image of the birth certificate of U.S. Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, along with text claiming Harris\u2019 parents had identified her as \u201cCaucasian\u201d on that certificate:\n\nWhatever the provenance of the document pictured here, it doesn\u2019t demonstrate anything about how she was racially identified at the time of her birth. The circled field above is clearly part of the section labeled \u201cMother of Child\u201d and designates the \u201cColor or Race of Mother,\u201d so it identifies Harris\u2019 mother (who was herself born in India) \u2014 not Harris herself \u2014 as \u201cCaucasian\u201d:\n\nThe corresponding fields for Harris\u2019 father identify his birthplace as Jamaica and list his \u201cColor or Race\u201d as \u201cJamaican.\u201d\n\nAs was common at the time (in California, at least), the birth certificate does not contain any field stating or identifying the race of the child.", "lang": "en"}
