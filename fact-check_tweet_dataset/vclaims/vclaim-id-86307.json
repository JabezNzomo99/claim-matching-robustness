Well over 100,000 fires have been detected this year, but who or what is responsible?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-10-07T07:00:56.189Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86307", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/07/brazilian-amazon-is-still-burning-who-is-responsible/", "vclaim": "Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research (INPE), which tracks fires in the Amazon, reports that the number of fires detected through September 2019 is up nearly 50 percent from the same period in 2018. (The number updates daily.) That said, the first nine months of 2019 have also seen roughly 10 percent fewer fires than the same period in 2017. Nevertheless, 2019 has seen just over 10,000 more fires than the Brazilian Amazon has seen on average over the past decade.\n\nStill, soybeans aren\u2019t the only commodity produced in this area of the Amazon. Many farms grow crops and have cattle, which as environmental activists are quick to point out, can mean that the big exporters may source product (inadvertently or not) from farms that may participate in some kind of annual burning. In the 2017 \u201cCold Meat\u201d scandal, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or IBAMA, identified JBS and 13 other companies that sourced cattle from illegally deforested areas. (JBS denied the claims in 2017.)\n\nThe Federal Plan of Action for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon relied on real-time collaboration between government agencies to stop deforestation fires as they were happening. But in 2015, the Brazilian economy fell into a deep recession, and deforestation rates started to rise again. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that the government was no longer focused on [the anti-deforestation] environmental policies,\u201d de Bolle said. \u201cIt was really that, because of this very deep recession, they ran out of money, and they were no longer able to fund a lot of these initiatives.\u201d By 2018, the Brazilian economy started to recover and was able to devote funding to the agencies responsible for monitoring fires. The number of fires began to decline.", "lang": "en"}
