The most recent example is that of India Today\u2019s Hindi news channel Aaj Tak. On 10th April 2017, Aaj Tak repeatedly posted a news on its official Facebook page. It was about a \u2018recently\u2019 issued \u2018fatwa\u2019 in Saudi Arabia stating \u201cmen can eat their wives if they are hungry.\u201d This news was posted repeatedly with different pictures.\n\nThe reality is that it is neither \u2018recent\u2019 nor is it \u2018News\u2019. News is a piece of information which is supposed to be \u2018current\u2019 and \u2018factual\u2019. On the contrary, this is a one and a half-year-old rumour which was quashed as fake when it first came up and became viral. Ironically, India Today\u2019s website \u2018DailyO\u2019 itself reported it to be fake back then on 29th October 2015. It was clearly reported on the DailO website that it was a fake fatwa which was going viral on social media. DailyO also stated that the \u2018news\u2019 first appeared in a sarcastic column written by a satirst Moroccan blogger called \u2018Israfel al-Maghribi\u2019.\n\nSo, why is Aaj Tak running a one and a half-year-old fake rumour as \u2018current news\u2019? Is the intent to accumulate \u2018likes\u2019 on its Facebook page by publishing click-bait articles which tap into a certain anti-Muslim sentiment that pervades in their potential audience? Is Aaj Tak is trying to outrun the various teensy Whatsapp groups spreading communal hatred? This business of hatred in the name of journalism is not new, but the low it has reached in recent times, is not to be found in history.", "lang": "en"}
