Accompanying those are claims that the expanded network may cause negative health effects in people.\n\nA post shared to The People say NO to 5G!\u2019s Facebook group reads: \u201cbig data and big telecom may be rushing to install 5G near your home\u201d during the COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nIt then lists a series of symptoms and diseases under the headings \u201cwhat you may feel\u201d, \u201cnow\u201d and \u201clater\u201d, implying a connection to 5G technology. Symptoms under \u201cnow\u201d include \u201cheadaches, heart palpitations, tingling, tinnitus, shortness of breath\u201d, and conditions under \u201clater\u201d include \u201ctumors (sic), cancers, DNA damage, cell damage and degenerative brain injury\u201d.\n\nThe caption accompanying the post reads, \u201cAs 5G rolls out around Australia, and the rest of the world, these are some symptoms you may be feeling, not associating it wireless (sic) radiation. Symptoms we would be inclined to think are stress, fear, age, cold\u2019s, flu and even coronavirus-like symptoms\u2026\u201d\n\nIt claims, \u201cThese basic symptoms can be the start of radiation sickness and can develop/be a contributing factor into known conditions of today.\u201d\n\nThe post has been shared more than 300 times and viewed more than 16,000 times since it was posted on June 28.\n\nThe post\u2019s first claim is that \u201cbig telcos\u201d and \u201cbig data\u201d may be rushing to install 5G during the lockdown.\n\nIn Australia, three vendors currently offer 5G networks: Telstra, Optus and Vodafone.\n\nA Telstra spokesperson told AAP FactCheck by email that the company had been rolling out 5G in a number of cities and towns across the country since August 2018.\n\n\u201cIn February we announced that we had switched on 5G coverage in 32 cities and regional towns across Australia,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cSince then, we\u2019ve switched on 5G coverage in another 15 cities and towns.\n\n\u201cAs with any new technology, a rollout picks up pace as more technology becomes available and our crews and contractors become more familiar with the building and construction work required.\u201d\n\nOptus is understood to have built 284 5G sites across Australia between March and the end of June, however the rate of construction remained in line with the average because access restrictions resulting from COVID-19 lockdowns prevented any acceleration.\n\nAccording to Vodafone\u2019s website, the company\u2019s first 5G network was switched on in March 2020 in Parramatta, NSW, with more to be switched on from mid-2020 in other major cities.\n\nThe second claim in the post lists the supposed health effects people could experience when exposed to 5G radiation.\n\nAccording to Professor Rodney Croft, an expert in the health impacts of mobile phone signals and other radio frequencies from the University of Wollongong, there is no link between the symptoms mentioned in the post and the radiation emitted by 5G devices.\n\n\u201cSuch claims are not new, and have tended to emerge following most new technological advances such as the introduction of microwave ovens, 2G, 3G, 4G and now 5G technologies,\u201d Prof Croft told AAP FactCheck.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence at all that the radiation from these devices, at the very low levels that people are exposed to, can cause any adverse health effect.\n\n\u201cAs a result, if someone is suffering from any kind of ill health, it is crucial to seek medical advice rather than rely on other people\u2019s claims that their problems will abate if they can avoid exposure to the radiation from 5G devices.\u201d\n\nAssociate Professor Sarah Loughran, director of the Australian Centre for Electromagnetic Bioeffects Research at the University of Wollongong, told AAP FactCheck there is no link between 5G radiation and negative health effects.\n\nDr Loughran said, in an emailed response, that symptoms people claim to experience when they believe they are being exposed to 5G radiation are more closely associated with a \u201cnocebo effect\u201d, or the suggestion or belief that something has a particular effect.\n\n\u201cIn this particular case, it would correspond to a misaligned belief that the electromagnetic energy associated with 5G is harmful and, therefore, when around devices that emit such fields they expect to feel bad, and they do,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) says there is \u201cno established evidence that low-level radio wave exposure from 5G can affect the immune system or cause any other long term or short term health effects\u201d.\n\nIn January, Australia\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy said there was no evidence that technologies such as 5G had adverse health impacts.\n\nAAP FactCheck has previously investigated and found false claims seeking to link 5G to illness or suggest that 5G hardware rollout has been accelerated during the COVID-19 lockdown.", "lang": "en"}
