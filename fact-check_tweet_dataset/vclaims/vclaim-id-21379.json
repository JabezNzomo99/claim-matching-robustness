Some observers, including atmospheric scientist Kait Parker, noticed that a graphic he used appeared a bit odd:\n\nThe graphic displayed by President Trump appeared to be a dated screen capture from a time-lapse National Hurricane Center graphic that charted Dorian\u2019s probable path. It also contained a black mark that misleadingly showed the storm\u2019s projected path heading deep into Alabama:\n\nDuring the briefing, Trump asked an aide to prop up the map, then he stated: \u201cOur original chart was that it was going to be hitting Florida directly \u2026 It was going to be hitting directly and that would have affected a lot of other states. But that was the original chart. And as you see it was going to hit not only Florida but Georgia and sort of was going toward the Gulf, that was what we \u2014 what was originally projected, and it took a right turn.\u201d\n\nWe sent questions to the White House asking why the black mark was drawn onto the map that was displayed during the briefing , and why President Trump displayed that particular map (which was outdated by almost a week) instead of a current one. We have not yet received answers to our questions.\n\nSome critics accused the White House of altering an official weather graphic to retroactively justify an earlier tweet by Trump that stated Alabama would be among the states \u201chit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by Dorian. Trump\u2019s Sept. 1 tweet forced the National Weather Service to correct the record and clarify that Alabama would not be affected by the powerful hurricane:\n\nWhen asked by a reporter about the map, which looked like \u201csomeone took a Sharpie\u201d marker and drew on it, Trump \u2014 who frequently accuses the news media of proffering \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAlthough we do not yet know who altered the map displayed during Trump\u2019s Sept. 4 hurricane briefing, we know the image and the purported hurricane path it represents are not found in a publicly available, time-lapsed graphic from the National Hurricane Center, which shows official projections of the storm\u2019s path. The mark appears to have been drawn on with a black marker. Thus we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
