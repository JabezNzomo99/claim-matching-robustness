The claims are false; the video shows the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) flag being waved at a Congress rally, not Pakistan\u2019s.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than 3,700 times since being shared on this misleading Facebook post on March 27, 2019.\n\nThe 30-second video zooms into one predominantly green flag with a white crescent and star on it. It is being waved among many Congress flags.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the misleading post; AFP has circled the green flag:\n\nThe caption states: \u201cThis is CONGRESS RALLY AT TUMKUR in Karnataka. Pakistan flag is waved along side Indian flag. This is CONGRESS culture. No surprise IMRAN KHAN wishing for a CONGRESS win.Some one rightly said. \" SECULARISM IS SAFE IN INDIA... BUT .. INDIA IS NOT SAFE WITH SECULARISM. \u201c(sic)\n\n\u201cCongress rally\u201d is a reference to a rally held by the Indian National Congress Party, India\u2019s main opposition party. Here is its official Twitter account.\n\n\u201cTumkur\u201d is a city in the Indian state of Karnataka.\n\n\u201cImran Khan\u201d is a reference to Pakistan\u2019s prime minister. Here is his official Twitter account.\n\nThe same video was shared on Facebook here with an identical claim. It was also shared on Twitter here with a caption questioning whether a Pakistani flag was being waved.\n\nThe same video was also published on YouTube here on May 9, 2018, with a caption stating a Pakistan flag was at a Congress rally. This clip has been viewed more than 16,000 times.\n\nThe flag in the video is clearly not Pakistan\u2019s. The Pakistan flag does have a white star and a white crescent on it, but it also has a distinct white stripe on its side. Below is an AFP photo of the Pakistan national flag.\n\nThe flag in the video in fact represents the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) political party.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the party\u2019s official website with their flag encircled in red.\n\nThis photo of IUML flags at one of its rallies was posted on the group\u2019s official Facebook page on March 15, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo:\n\nThe orange, white and green flags in the video represent the Indian National Congress party.\n\nThis is an AFP photo of Indian National Congress flags at a rally in Guwahati on February 26, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the AFP photo:\n\nDuring the 2018 Karnataka state elections, the IUML was an ally of the Indian National Congress party. This article in The Hindu published on April 12, 2018, reported on their alliance.\n\nThe claim in the misleading posts that the video was filmed in the city of Tumkur, Karnataka state, is also false. It was in fact a Congress rally in Belgaum, another city in Karnataka state.\n\nKarnataka Congress leader Mr. Y Sayeed Ahmad told AFP by telephone that the video in the misleading posts was filmed during an Indian Congress rally in Belgaum. \u201cThis happened in Belgaum on May 6, 2018 during the state assembly elections,\u201d he said.\n\nAFP confirmed the video was filmed in Belgaum by analysing signs and other location information in the clip.\n\nIn the video, a sign for \u201cSaleeque Hospital\u201d can be seen. Below is a screenshot of the Saleeque hospital sign:\n\nThis local government document for Karnataka state lists the address for Saleeque Hospital as Mehaboob Plaza, Main Road, New Gandhi Nagar, Belagavi, Belgaum.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the address on page 46:", "lang": "en"}
