A day later, the website LFR Solutions published a story that claimed Hill was dropped from his Wrangler endorsement because of the reveal.\n\nThe article, which has attained over 16,700 shares on Facebook since being posted on July 1, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
