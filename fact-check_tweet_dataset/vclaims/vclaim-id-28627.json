He also repeated a bevy of claims we\u2019ve debunked before.\n\u2022 Trump claimed a general, whom he \u201chad to fire,\u201d told him it would take \u201ctwo years\u201d to retake all of the land once held by the terrorist group ISIS, while generals in Iraq told him it would only take \u201cone week.\u201d But the top U.S. official for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS said shortly before Trump\u2019s Iraq trip that it would take \u201ca period of months.\u201d\n\u2022 In defending protectionist tariffs, Trump wrongly claimed the U.S. \u201cended tariffs\u201d in 1913. The average tariff was reduced from 40 percent to 27 percent, and the list of duty-free goods was expanded. But tariffs didn\u2019t end. In fact, they went up in 1922 and 1930 \u2014 the latter, the Smoot-Hawley Act, resulted in \u201cdisastrous consequences,\u201d as one expert told us.\n\u2022 The president claimed \u201cAfrican American income has reached an all-time high.\u201d The real median income for black households declined slightly in 2017, according to the most recent data available.\n\u2022 Trump claimed he told former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you a new nickname,\u201d calling Mattis, \u201cMad Dog,\u201d a nickname the Marine Corps general actually has had since at least 2004.\n\nWe focused on new claims by the president in this article, but his speech also contained many claims we\u2019ve written about before, including falsehoods on the trade deficit, legislation concerning veterans, military spending, immigration policy and employment.\n\nIn his appearance at the annual CPAC event, Trump told a long story about a general whom he \u201chad to fire\u201d telling him it would take two years to retake 100 percent of the territory once held by ISIS. Trump said \u201cthen I flew to Iraq\u201d where other generals told him, \u201cwe can have it totally finished in one week.\u201d But a few weeks before Trump\u2019s December visit to Iraq, Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Brett McGurk said it would take \u201ca period of months\u201d to retake the remaining 1 percent of ISIS-held territory.\n\nReuters reported on Feb. 28 that the Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by the United States, had indicated it would announce victory over ISIS in one week. That would make McGurk\u2019s estimate correct.\n\nWe asked the White House press office about the president\u2019s comments, but we haven\u2019t received a response. We don\u2019t know what unnamed generals told the president. However, the story as Trump tells it contradicts public statements by McGurk.\n\nHere\u2019s part of the president\u2019s comments on the topic at CPAC:\n\nTrump, March 2: But I was told by a general, who I had to fire \u2014 I said, \u201cGeneral, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate?\u201d He said, \u201cSir, two years.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t take it two years.\u201d And then I flew to Iraq. \u2026 So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants. \u2026 And I said to the generals, \u201cListen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left.\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t, sir.\u201d And I said, \u201cTell me why it won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t, sir. If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster.\u201d \u201cOkay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can\u201d \u2014 \u201cSir, we can have it totally finished in one week.\u201d I said, \u201cOne week? I was told two years.\u201d (Laughter.) One week? \u201cThat\u2019s right, sir. We\u2019re only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over \u2014 from the base that you\u2019re right on, right now, sir. They won\u2019t know what the hell hit them.\u201d \u2026 And I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t my other generals tell me that? Why didn\u2019t they tell me that?\u201d I said, \u201cDid you tell them that?\u201d \u201cNot our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders. You\u2019re the first one to ask us our opinion.\u201d (Applause.) It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. True. True.\n\nTrump said a general told him it would take \u201ctwo years\u201d to take \u201c100 percent of the caliphate\u201d and he got a very different story from generals in Iraq. But McGurk had said on Dec. 11 \u2014 two weeks before the president\u2019s visit to Iraq \u2014 in a State Department briefing, \u201cBallpark, you\u2019re talking a period of months,\u201d to retake the remaining 1 percent of ISIS territory.\n\nMcGurk said that in early 2016 about 50 percent of the territory ISIS had once held had been reclaimed. \u201cSo if you look at where we are today, I think it\u2019s quite significant. We really are now down to the last 1 percent of the physical territory,\u201d he said. \u201cThe final splotch of red down in what we call the Middle Euphrates Valley, those operations are ongoing, with the Syrian Democratic Forces, supported, of course, by small numbers of coalition forces on the ground.\u201d\n\nHe said that while \u201cthe end of the physical caliphate is clearly now coming into sight, the end of ISIS will be a much more long-term initiative. \u2026 Defeating a physical caliphate is one phase of a much longer-term campaign.\u201d McGurk said a \u201cstabilization effort in Iraq and Syria\u201d would \u201creally take a period of years.\u201d\n\nCNBC reported that McGurk made similar comments on Dec. 15 in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re on track now over the coming months to defeat what used to be the physical space that ISIS controlled,\u201d CNBC quoted McGurk telling reporter and anchor Hadley Gamble. \u201cThat will not be the end of ISIS.\u201d\n\nFour days after that interview, on Dec. 19, Trump announced on Twitter that U.S. troops would be withdrawing from Syria. \u201cWe\u2019ve beaten them and we\u2019ve beaten them badly,\u201d Trump said of ISIS. A week later, the president and first lady visited the troops in Iraq, arriving on Dec. 26.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before on this issue, military experts cautioned against declaring victory against ISIS even if the physical land has nearly been completely retaken.\n\nMcGurk and Defense Secretary James Mattis resigned in protest after Trump\u2019s withdrawal announcement.\n\nAs for \u201cGeneral Raisin Caine,\u201d a military affairs reporter for Politico tweeted that Air Force Brig. Gen. J. Daniel Caine, who is the deputy commanding general (forward) for Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq, has the nickname \u201cRaisin.\u201d Or perhaps it is \u201cRazin,\u201d as Politico later wrote. We asked the Air Force public affairs office if it would confirm that and comment on whether the conversation in Iraq, as Trump tells it, occurred. We haven\u2019t received a response.\n\nOne last, related point: Trump claimed in his CPAC speech that he gave Mattis his nickname of \u201cMad Dog.\u201d\n\nMattis has had the nickname \u201cMad Dog\u201d longer than Trump has been president. A 2006 story in The Atlantic said \u201chis admiring grunts\u201d used the moniker. The Military Times found the nickname used two years earlier, in a Los Angeles Times story.\n\nIn discussing the trade war with China, the president went on a long, largely accurate riff about the Great Tariff Debate of 1888, when the two major parties disagreed on how to reduce the budget surplus. (Yes, federal surplus.)\n\nAt the time, prior to the introduction of the federal income tax, import duties accounted for about half of federal revenues. During the 1888 presidential campaign, there was a partisan disagreement over what to do with the budget surplus. There were two schools of thought: \u201c[T]he Democrats proposed a tariff reduction to reduce customs revenue, the Republicans offered higher tariffs to reduce imports and customs revenue,\u201d Douglas A. Irwin, a Dartmouth economics professor, wrote in a paper that analyzed \u201cthe fiscal aspects of the \u2018Great Tariff Debate of 1888.\u2019\u201d\n\nRepublican Benjamin Harrison won the election and signed into law the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which increased tariffs on average to nearly 50 percent, according to the House Office of the Historian. Rep. William McKinley, who would become president in 1897, said high tariffs were needed to protect workers\u2019 wages and U.S. industry.\n\nSo, Trump was right about the 1888 tariff debate. But he was wrong when he went on to say, \u201cThen, in 1913, they ended tariffs.\u201d\n\nTrump was referring to the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913, which reduced but did not eliminate tariffs. It was signed into law by Democratic President Woodrow Wilson.\n\n\u201cUnder the new schedule, the average tariff on dutiable imports would fall from 40 percent to 27 percent, a decline of about one third,\u201d Irwin, the Dartmouth professor, writes in his book \u201cClashing Over Commerce,\u201d a history of the U.S. trade policy. \u201cThe Underwood-Simmons tariff made a substantial across-the-board reduction of about 25 percent in duties on manufactured goods and put a large number of products on the duty-free list, including wool, iron, coal, lumber, meat, dairy products, leather boots and shoes, wood pulp and paper, wheat, and agricultural supplies; the duty on sugar was to be abolished gradually over three years. The share of duty-free imports rose from 54 percent of total imports in 1912 to 69 percent in 1916.\u201d\n\nIn an email to us, Irwin said, \u201cIt did not \u2018end\u2019 tariffs \u2013 but it did reduce them, although they went back up in 1922 and again in 1930 \u2013 the latter with disastrous consequences (the Smoot Hawley tariff).\u201d\n\nIrwin is referring to the Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922 and Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 \u2014 both of which raised tariffs substantially.\n\n\u201cAfter World War I, Republicans returned to power and in 1922 passed the Fordney-McCumber Tariff, which restored high rates and pushed some to record levels,\u201d Spencer Howard writes in a blog for the Herbert Hoover Library and Museum.\n\nThe U.S. Senate Historical Office writes that the Smoot-Hawley Act, which was signed into law by Republican President Herbert Hoover, had disastrous consequences for U.S. trade and Hoover.\n\n\u201cAs the economists predicted, the high tariff proved to be a disaster,\u201d the U.S. Senate Historical Office writes. \u201cEven before its enactment, U.S. trading partners began retaliating by raising their tariff rates, which froze international trade. The tariff fight solidified Hoover\u2019s ties with Republican regulars, but it shredded his standing among his party\u2019s progressives. Most of the progressive Republican senators who had campaigned for Hoover in 1928 wound up endorsing Franklin D. Roosevelt for president in the next election.\u201d\n\nIn reeling off some economic statistics, the president claimed that \u201cAfrican American income has reached an all-time high.\u201d It hasn\u2019t \u2014 at least not by the traditional measure of real median household income.\n\nIn September, the Census Bureau released its income and poverty report for 2017. The median income for black households (Table A-1) was $40,258 in 2017. After adjusting for inflation, that was a decrease of $81 from 2016, which was President Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office. (The median figure represents the midpoint \u2014 half of all households earned more, half less.)\n\nThe real median income was also higher in 1999 ($41,192), 2000 ($42,348) and 2001 ($40,902). The chart below from the Census Bureau illustrates the trend over time in 2017 dollars.\n\nWe asked the White House for information supporting the president\u2019s claim about African American income reaching an all-time high on his watch, but we did not get a response.\n\nAs we usually do in fact-checking claims about income, we used the Census Bureau data for all households. Census also provides data by type of household: family households (married couples and households with a parent and at least one child but no spouse) and nonfamily households (female and male). The median income for black family households was $52,384 \u2014 an increase of $358 from 2016 and the highest it has been since at least 1980, which is as far back as the Census Bureau provides data for black family households.\n\nWe should also note that Census warns about comparing 2017 median household income data to estimates prior to 2013. Starting then, the Census Bureau redesigned its questions, and the annual survey has picked up some sources of income that were previously missed. Jonathan L. Rothbaum, chief of the Income Statistics Branch, wrote that the redesigned questions resulted in higher household income estimates.\n\nThe president spoke for a little more than two hours, which was plenty of time for him to repeat false and misleading claims he often makes. We include some here, linking to our previous stories:\n\u2022 Trump inflated the trade deficit with China \u2014 claiming it was \u201c$500 billion a year,\u201d when it\u2019s $335.7 billion for 2017 \u2014 and the overall trade deficit \u2014 putting it at \u201c$800 billion\u201d when it\u2019s actually $552.3 billion.\n\u2022 He wrongly claimed that \u201cyou couldn\u2019t fire\u201d \u201csadists\u201d and \u201csick people\u201d in the Department of Veterans Affairs before he signed into law the bipartisan Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. The VA fired more than 2,000 employees each year going back to 2006 for discipline and performance reasons before Trump took office, according to data the agency reported to the Office of Personnel Management. The law Trump signed made it easier for the VA secretary to remove employees.\n\u2022 And he falsely said that he got VA Choice \u201capproved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved,\u201d when the law \u2014 the bipartisan Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act \u2014 was signed in 2014 by President Barack Obama, giving veterans facing long wait times an option to get care outside the VA system.\n\u2022 Trump puffed up his record on military spending, saying, \u201cnobody has ever heard of these numbers before.\u201d He cited a $700 billion budget authority in fiscal year 2018 and $716 billion in fiscal 2019 . In nominal dollars \u2014 not adjusted for inflation \u2014 the budget authority for defense in 2010 and 2011 were each larger than those numbers. That\u2019s according to figures from the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget\n\u2022 The president falsely said that under U.S. immigration policy, \u201cWe catch them, we realize they\u2019re a criminal, and we have to release them.\u201d Immigration authorities are not obligated to release anyone apprehended while trying to cross the border illegally, and, in fact, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is required to hold certain criminals, such as those convicted of an aggravated felony or multiple criminal convictions. That\u2019s under the Immigration Nationality Act, Section 236 (c).\n\u2022 He again got the facts wrong on the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, claiming that other countries \u201csend us the people they don\u2019t want\u201d and the program allows murderers to enter the U.S. Individuals apply to this lottery program, which randomly issues up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year to those from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. Those selected have to pass a background security vetting process , and there are several grounds for inadmissibility, including criminal activity.\n\u2022 Trump once again made the hollow boast that \u201cmore people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country.\u201d With the population increasing every day, this isn\u2019t the accomplishment Trump makes it out to be. The number of people working has gone up fairly steadily, with exceptions during recessions, ever since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started measuring employment in 1939.", "lang": "en"}
