It\u2019s also true that the United States has a population of approximately 327 million people. However, if you doled out $500 million equally among 327 million people, they would not each receive $1 million. In reality, Bloomberg spent enough to give each American about $1.50.\n\nSo Williams and Gay were off by about $1 million per person.\n\nAt the time of this writing, neither Williams nor MSNBC had corrected the mistake. Gay posted a message on Twitter attempting to laugh off the blunder, writing that she was \u201cbuying a calculator\u201d:\n\nBloomberg has an estimated net worth of about $60 billion. If Bloomberg were to divide his wealth equally among the American population, each person would receive less than $200. In order for every American to receive $1 million, he\u2019d need to draw from a wealth pool of $327 trillion.", "lang": "en"}
