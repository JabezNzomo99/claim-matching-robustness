But drunk in power, the government along with the media is enjoying the oppression of Muslims)\n\nWhen the team at NewsMobile fact-checked the above post, we found that the claim attached to the picture is fake.\n\n On putting the picture through Reverse Image search and using some keywords like \u2018father\u2019, \u2018kills\u2019, \u2018son\u2019, we came across a YouTube video published on April 19 which talks about the same incident.\n\nAccording to the video, the incident took place in Rahim Yar Khan in Pakistan, where Liaquat Hussain strangulated his son and hung his corpse by a rope to frame his in-laws in the murder.\n\nAccording to a report by The Tribune on the same incident, Superintendent of Police Investigation, Faraz Ahmed, addressed a press conference and revealed that the man had killed his minor son to take revenge from his wife\u2019s family.\n\nHence, it proves that the picture was not clicked in India and it is not related to the lockdown or Coronavirus.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
