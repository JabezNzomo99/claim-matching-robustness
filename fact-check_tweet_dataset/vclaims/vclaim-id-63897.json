A video from Pakistan showing a large group of people including children uprooting the newly planted trees is viral on social media with a claim that \u201cplanting trees is against Islam\".\n\nThe caption to one such video uploaded by a verified user on Twitter reads, \u201cImran Khan copied PM Shri Modi\u2019s \u2018Tree Plantation Drive\u2019 in Pakistan but his followers uprooted all trees because they feel \u201cPlanting trees is against Islam\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim is misleading. The locals in the video are uprooting the trees because the administration had planted them on a disputed private land without their permission.\n\nThe claim is also viral on Facebook.\n\nThe archived versions of the viral post can be seen here, here and here.\n\nWhen we did a Google search using the keywords \u201cPakistan\u201d and \u201cuprooting trees\u201d, we found that a number of media houses in India and Pakistan have reported the incident which took place on August 9.\n\nAccording to \u201cThe News International\u201d, an English news daily in Pakistan, the incident happened at Pakistan\u2019s Khyber\u2019s Mandi Kass district. As per the report, the crowd was protesting against the government\u2019s move to plant trees on a disputed land without their permission.\n\nThe protesters reportedly uprooted over 6,000 new trees planted by the administration.\n\nTo get more details regarding the incident, AFWA contacted a local journalist from Mandi Kass who belongs to the Urdu Newspaper Akhbar-e-Khaber.\n\nUnder conditions of anonymity, the local reporter said, \u201cThe land where the dispute happened is a 50 acres private land and its ownership dispute lies between a local tribe named Shahi Khel and a local influential Malik Muhammad Ali who belongs to Afridi Tribe. Muhammad Ali had sought a stay order from the court before the plantation was done but the trees were still planted with the approval of the Shahi tribe. That's why the trees were uprooted by the people of Afridi tribe. An FIR was registered immediately against 10 people while 5 of them were arrested.\u201d\n\nAFWA also contacted an Islamic scholar to understand what Islam says about nature conservation.\n\nAbdus Samad, Assistant professor at the department of Islamic studies at Osmania University Hyderabad said, \u201cNo religion is against nature. Also, the plantation drive is not a novel idea. Fourteen centuries ago, the Prophet has asked us to plant a tree even if it is our last deed.\u201d\n\nHence the claim that people from Pakistan are uprooting trees because Islam is against tree plantation is false. The people were protesting against the government\u2019s decision to plant trees on a land which is disputed.", "lang": "en"}
