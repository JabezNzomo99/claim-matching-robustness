No, that's not true (the Fox part). A satirical site aimed at riling up conservatives and Trump supporters had the show picked up by Netflix, NBC and now Fox but it is all not true.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Daily World Update on May 30, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: Roseanne Finds A New Home At Fox\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIt's been a roller-coaster ride of a day for Roseanne Barr, who lost her show this morning after a joke on Twitter that snowflake liberals found offensive. Within hours, the show was picked up by Netflix, who then reneged after a call from Deep State operative Barack Obama. That wasn't the end of the road, however, as NBC stepped up and said they would take on the politically correct left and run the show for at least two seasons. Later, however, after the casts of Saturday Night Live and 11 other shows threatened to quit, they reneged as well.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about dailyworldupdate.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Roseanne NOT Picked Up By NBC\n\u2022 Fake News: Netflix Did NOT Cave, Did NOT Cancel Roseanne After 'A Phone Call From Obama'\n\u2022 Fake News: George HW Bush NOT Dead After Overdosing On Wife Barbara's Pills\n\u2022 Fake News: Obama NOT Caught Smuggling Booze, Drugs And Underage Girls Into Enemy Territory\n\u2022 Fake News: Santa Fe Killer Did NOT Confess His Love For Obama", "lang": "en"}
