The government still runs a deficit, spending more than its income. As a result, government debt continues to go up.\n\nGovernment debt was \u00a31 trillion in 2009/10, and was just above \u00a31.7 trillion in 2016/17. Forecasts suggest it will be over 1.8 trillion this year.\n\nThe government set targets to do with eliminating the deficit in 2010 (which it didn\u2019t meet) and in 2015 (which it abandoned after the EU referendum).\n\nThe deficit has fallen by nearly three quarters between 2009/10 and 2016/17, when compared to the size of the economy.", "lang": "en"}
