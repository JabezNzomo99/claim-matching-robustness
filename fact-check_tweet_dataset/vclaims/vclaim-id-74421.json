She and Ghislaine Maxwell are not related.\n\nThis particular claim emerged online after Ghislaine Maxwell, the confidante and ex-girlfriend of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, got arrested in New Hampshire on charges that she allegedly helped him recruit women to sexually abuse. Epstein died of an apparent suicide in jail while awaiting trial for federal sex trafficking charges, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe post attempts to link Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to Ghislaine Maxwell. It alleges that Fauci\u2019s wife is Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s sister, Christine.\n\n\u201cDr. Fauci\u2019s wife is sisters with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s sidekick that is in jail right now,\u201d reads the accompanying text. \u201cThe cabal of corruption runs far and wide they all know one another.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Boris Johnson With Ghislaine Maxwell?)\n\nThat is, however, incorrect.

Christine Maxwell is married to astrophysicist Roger Malina, according to multiple media reports.\n\nDeAnna Lorraine, a former Republican congressional candidate, tweeted the same claim but later corrected herself.\n\n\u201cLooks like the connection may not be accurate w Fauci\u2019 wife/Maxwell,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cWhen ppl sent me this I researched it & it checked out at first, I\u2019m sorry for getting excited about the connection & jumping gun. I\u2019m on the move, will make sure I spend more time researching moving forward.\u201d\n\nFauci has become a popular target for misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic.
