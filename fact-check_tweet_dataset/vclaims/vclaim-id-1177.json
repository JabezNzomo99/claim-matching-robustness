For example, a reference to the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 has been changed to the Bali attacks of the following year, in which 202 people including 88 Australians were killed.\n\nAccording to fact-checking website Snopes, the original piece by veteran Barry Loudermilk was first published in a local paper (here) and posted again by VietNow National Magazine.\n\nReuters could not find any reference to remarks by Gillard about sharia law. The subject had been debated in the country years before she came to power (here).\n\nComments about monitoring mosques also preceded Gillard\u2019s tenure. In 2005, then Prime Minister John Howard was reported to have approved the surveillance of mosques and Islamic schools (here) and (here).\n\nSome of Gillard\u2019s comments on immigration and multiculturalism made in 2012 can be seen here (here). In a lecture, Gillard called for a balance between the \u201cthe right to maintain one's customs, language and religion\u201d and \u201can equal responsibility to learn English, find work, respect our culture and heritage, and accept women as full equals\u201d. The speech makes no reference to any religion or group.\n\nFalse. The comments attributed to Julia Gillard were mainly lifted from an article by a U.S. veteran.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
