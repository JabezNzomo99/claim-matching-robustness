Both have been the subject of misinformation on Facebook in recent months.

They didn\u2019t go to China because it\u2019s already a communist country!\u201d\n\nWhile China does lead the world in both carbon and total greenhouse gas emissions, it does not account for 90% of global carbon emissions. The country emitted approximately 9.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2018, according to the 2019 BP Statistical Review of World Energy report. That equates to about 27.8% of global carbon emissions.\n\nThe same report found that the U.S., the number two emitter, produced roughly 5.1 billion tons of carbon emissions in 2018, or approximately 15.2% of the global 33.9 billion tons. (The International Energy Agency and Global Carbon Project report similar figures.)\n\nChina surpassed the U.S. as the top emitter in 2005, per the 2019 BP Statistical Review of World Energy report. It now emits more carbon than both the U.S. and the European Union (EU) combined, according to The New York Times.

In large part, the country meets its increased energy demand by burning coal, according to The New York Times. The Global Carbon Project found that a majority of Chinese carbon emissions come from this method of energy production.\n\nAs a signatory of the Paris Agreement, China has pledged that its emissions will peak no later than 2030.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
