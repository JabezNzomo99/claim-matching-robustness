Norway and Switzerland followed at $4,579 and $4,568, respectively.\n\nThe United States maintained its spending lead in the years that followed. But Sanders puts the difference too strongly when he says U.S. spending is \"almost twice\" per capita of \"any other country.\"\n\nAccording to the OECD\u2019s , U.S. spending grew to $8,713 per capita in 2013. Switzerland and Norway came in second and third at $6,325 and $5,862 per capita, respectively.\n\nHad Sanders fine-tuned his talking point by claiming that the United States spends twice as much per capita as the average developed country, his statement would been accurate. Average per capita spending is less than $3,500 across the 32 countries listed in the OECD database. That\u2019s 40 percent of what the United States spends per person.\n\nA spokesman for Sanders could not be reached for comment.\n\nSanders said that \"we spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.\"\n\nThe United States spends more on health care per capita than other countries, but not always twice as much. Sanders\u2019 comment suggests the United States outpaces all other countries more than it actually does. European countries with extensive social service networks aren\u2019t so far behind the United States.", "lang": "en"}
