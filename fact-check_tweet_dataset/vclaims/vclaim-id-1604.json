Moscow was implicated since it had claimed the protesters in Ukraine were being directed by foreign agents.\n\nIn 2015, on the eve of a protest he was organizing, a leaked audio recording of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov insulting other opposition leaders was released, perhaps in an effort to divide the opposition. Nemtsov was murdered on a bridge right outside the Kremlin walls not long after the incident. \n\n \n\n Other incidents share more in common with these new allegations against Donald Trump since they involve disclosure of embarrassing private information. Putin\u2019s first prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov and Boris Yeltsin\u2019s prosecutor-general Yuri Skuratov were both discredited with the release of sex tapes that were recorded without their knowledge. In fact, Skuratov\u2019s removal was instrumental in the rise of Vladimir Putin.\n\n \n\n In April 2010, a month after Viktor Shenderovich published an article entitled \u201cPutin Must Go,\u201d a video emerged appearing to show the Russian satirist having sex with an infamous Kremlin \u201choneytrap.\u201d The video was released two days before his daughter\u2019s wedding. \n\n \n\n In April 2016, a video emerged of the leader of the Russian Parnas opposition party, Mikhail Kasyanov, apparently having sex with fellow Parnas party member Natalya Pelevina. Within a short period of time, Pelevina was the victim of hacking attacks and Kasyanov was threatened by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Soon after the Kasyanov leak, and for a variety of reasons, the besieged Russian opposition became disunited and was ultimately defeated in September\u2019s parliamentary elections.\n\n \n\n Furthermore, there is much evidence to suggest that the Russian government is behind the hacking of entities and individuals involved in the recent U.S. presidential election, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Republican National Committee (RNC).\n\nAs early as July 2016, technology and cyber security experts analyzed evidence of the hacking attacks against the DNC and found strong evidence that two Russian intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU, were behind those attacks. Furthermore, the cover story -- that a single Romanian hacker named Guccifer 2.0 -- fell apart when the hacker could not communicate in Romanian. A new report released by the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike in December also concluded that there was strong evidence linking the Russian GRU to the hacking of the DNC.\n\nIn early December, U.S. intelligence agencies released their own report that they have \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the Russian government worked to interfere in the U.S. election (), and the beneficiary of that attack, Trump, admitted on January 11 that he too believed Russia was behind the attacks.", "lang": "en"}
