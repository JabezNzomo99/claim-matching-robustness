The claim is false; this video shows a 2010 train accident in China\u2019s Sichuan province where a bridge collapsed due to flooding.\n\nThe two-minute 20-second video has been viewed more than 600 times after it was published on Twitter here on April 22, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s simplified Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201cChinese mainland train 165 from Xi'an to Kunming, bridge washed away, carriages in the middle fell into the river, just happened.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe footage includes audible voices speaking Mandarin, some of which translate to English as: \u201cRight here, look! Rescue vehicle is ahead\u201d; \u201c165, from Xi\u2019an to Kunming...Here we are!\u201d; \u201cOh see\u2026It\u2019s the middle two carriages!\u201d; \u201cHave you filmed the carriages in the water?\u201d\n\nThe same footage was also shared alongside a similar claim on Twitter here, here and here; and on YouTube here. It circulated in other posts claiming that the incident occurred in 2019 on Facebook here, here and here; and on Twitter here.\n\nHowever, these claims are false; the video shows a train accident in China in 2010.\n\nA keyword search found that Chinese state media organisation China Daily reported on the accident in an article published here on August 19, 2010. The article's headline translates to English as: \u201cTrain cars fall into river in SW China, no injuries\u201d and includes a photo of the accident.\n\nThe photo\u2019s caption reports that two train carriages from the \u201cK165 train from Xi'an to Kunming\u201d were swept into a \u201criver after floods destroyed a bridge in Guanghan, Sichuan province.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the China Daily article:\n\nBelow is a comparison of screenshots from the misleading Twitter video (L) and the photo from the China Daily news report (R):\n\nThe 2010 incident was also widely reported by other Chinese media outlets, including here by China Network Television and here by Xi\u2019an Daily newspaper.\n\nThe site of the accident in Guanghan city can be seen on Google Maps here.\n\nIn February 2011, some six months after the accident, the train\u2019s crew was awarded in the annual Touching China ceremony, which honours brave and extraordinary actions by citizens. The crew was recognised for safeguarding passengers during the accident and can be seen being honoured here (51:18 - 59:30) in a broadcast by Chinese state-owned television network CCTV.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the TV programme:", "lang": "en"}
