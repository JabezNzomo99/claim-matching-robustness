The scheme is a real one, but it only applies to rhinos and it does not turn the outside of the horns a bright colour.\n\nThe text in the image refers to a scheme to make rhino horns and elephant ivory unsellable and thus stop animals being killed. It reads \u201cThey use the same pink dye that they use on bank notes. This makes the ivory unsellable and it can\u2019t be consumed. (the animals are not harmed and it is saving their lives)\u201d.\n\nAs explained by conservation charity Save the Rhino, there were several real projects where rhinos had their horns filled with a liquid poison/dye mix to devalue their price and deter poachers. The poison is an ectoparasiticide, which is environmentally friendly but toxic to humans, and the dye is the same type of \u201canti-theft\u201d ink that is used to tag people and money during robberies.\n\nHowever, the aim of the scheme is to dye the interior of the horn and has very little effect to the outside of the horn. This is a photo of a rhino that has been treated with the dye. The scheme purposely doesn\u2019t leave visible permanent markers because this may \u201cmake untreated animals on the same properties bigger targets\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve not seen any evidence of the scheme being applied to other animals, including elephants.\n\nNotably, there has been criticism of how effective this method will be at stopping poaching incidents.\n\nThe images\u2014which show an elephant with bright pink tusks and a rhinoceros with a bright purple horn\u2014have been digitally altered, as also reported by Africa Check. The same, but unaltered, photos of the elephant and rhino can be found online.", "lang": "en"}
