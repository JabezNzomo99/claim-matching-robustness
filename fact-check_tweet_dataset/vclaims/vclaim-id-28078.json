If the Radical Left Democrats were sane, which they are not, it would be case over!\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, in a tweet on Monday morning\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian president came out and said very strongly that President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. That should be case over.\u201d \n\n\u2014 Mr. Trump in remarks to reporters on Monday morning\n\nThis is misleading. Mr. Trump was most likely referring to \u2014 and distorting \u2014 comments President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made in an interview with Time magazine and other publications published early Monday morning .
