Only the deputy attorney general who appointed Mueller can fire him and only for cause. But Trump could fire the DAG, or order the special-counsel regulations repealed and fire Mueller himself.\n\n\n\nCan the president fire the special council himself or does he need the acting FBI director to do the firing at the president\u2019s bidding?\n\nWhen a confidant of President Trump said on PBS on June 12 that the president was \u201cconsidering perhaps terminating the special counsel,\u201d it set off a wave of speculation about the political fallout of such a move. It also raised the question, \u201cCan he?\u201d\n\nOn June 13, Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president has the \u201cright\u201d to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, but won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWhile the president has the right to, he has no intention to do so,\u201d Sanders told a gaggle of reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nOthers disagree. On MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on June 15, Republican Sen. John Thune, for example, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think legally he can.\u201d\n\nThere is a good bit of debate and some disagreement among constitutional scholars about the ways the president could remove Mueller if he wanted to, and the legality of such steps. But one thing is clear, it would not be as simple as firing off a termination letter, as the president did to remove FBI Director James Comey.\n\nJust days after Trump fired Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the decision to appoint Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to investigate any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government\u2019s efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe president has called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d and on June 12, Christopher Ruddy, CEO of the conservative Newsmax Media and a friend of the president, told PBS NewsHour\u2019s Judy Woodruff: \u201cI think he\u2019s considering perhaps terminating the special counsel. I think he\u2019s weighing that option.\u201d Later that night, the White House said only that Ruddy \u201cnever spoke to the president regarding this issue.\u201d The following day, the New York Times reported \u2014 based on interviews with several anonymous sources \u201cwith direct knowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s interactions\u201d \u2014 that Trump entertained the idea of terminating Mueller, but that staff persuaded him against it.\n\nTrump himself has not publicly acknowledged or denied that he considered firing Mueller, and as we said, Sanders said the president has the \u201cright to\u201d but that \u201che has no intention to do so.\u201d\n\nOn June 14, the Washington Post reported that Mueller has expanded the probe to include whether Trump tried to obstruct justice. In response, Trump fired off two tweets, describing claims of collusion and obstruction of justice as \u201cphony\u201d and calling the investigation, \u201cthe single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history \u2013 led by some very bad and conflicted people!\u201d\n\nBut could he legally squash the investigation if he wanted to?\n\nBecause Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation, the decision to appoint a special counsel fell to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. In his order making the appointment, Rosenstein cited federal regulations issued by the attorney general in 1999, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4-600.10. The rules were drafted in the wake of the Kenneth Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton.\n\nAccording to those regulations, a special counsel \u201cmay be disciplined or removed from office only by the personal action of the Attorney General\u201d (or in this case, the acting attorney general). And Rosenstein can\u2019t just do it on a whim, either. According to the regulation, special counsel can only be removed \u201cfor misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of Departmental policies.\u201d\n\nIn a Senate hearing on June 13, Rosenstein said he alone exercises firing authority, and that he had not seen any evidence of good cause for firing Mueller.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly theoretically possible that the attorney general could fire him, but that\u2019s the only person who has authority to fire him,\u201d Rosenstein said. \u201cAnd in fact, the chain of command for the special counsel is only directly to the attorney general, in this case the acting attorney general.\u201d\n\nIn a House hearing that same day, Rosenstein again said that the decision to fire Mueller was his, and that he would not be swayed even if Trump ordered him to fire Mueller.\n\n\u201cI have a federal regulation and I\u2019m going to faithfully enforce that regulation,\u201d Rosenstein said. \u201cThe regulation provides that a special counsel may be removed only for good cause and so it doesn\u2019t matter who gives me an order, what that order is, if there isn\u2019t good cause, I would not fire the special counsel.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Rosenstein argues that Trump could not fire Mueller directly. He could call on Rosenstein to do so, but if Rosenstein concluded there was no \u201cgood cause\u201d to fire Mueller, he could refuse.\n\nIf he wanted to, wrote Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and co-founder of Lawfare, Trump could then fire Rosenstein. In that case, the authority over Mueller would fall to the associate attorney general. In theory \u2014 and ignoring the political consequences of doing so \u2014 Trump could keep firing people until he got someone to follow through on an order to fire Mueller.\n\n\u201cThat means it could go down the line until an assistant attorney general did not resign and instead carried out the President\u2019s order,\u201d Goldsmith wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s highly unlikely, wrote Marty Lederman, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel from 2009 to 2010.\n\n\u201c[I]f Trump wants to get rid of Mueller, he\u2019d have to somehow get to a point where he\u2019d have in place an Acting Attorney General who was willing either to find \u2018good cause\u2019 for the removal or rescind the good-cause regulation, and then also fire Mueller,\u201d Lederman wrote.\n\nAs we said, Rosenstein is now on record saying he does not believe there is cause to remove Mueller, and he would not make such a move unless there was, even if the president ordered it. Lederman doubts anyone in the attorney general\u2019s office who might replace Rosenstein would either, and \u201crisk the likely ruination of his or her professional and moral reputation.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s yet another route the president could take, Neal Katyal, a professor of national security law at Georgetown University, wrote in a piece for the Washington Post on May 19: \u201cTrump could order the special-counsel regulations repealed and then fire Mueller himself.\u201d\n\nKatyal said he would know, because back in 1999, he was tapped by then-Attorney General Janet Reno to head an internal working group on the issue of special counsel \u2014 and he helped write the regulations now being cited by Rosenstein.\n\n\u201cThe rules provide only so much protection: Congress, Trump and the Justice Department still have the power to stymie (or even terminate) Mueller\u2019s inquiry,\u201d Katyal wrote.\n\nAccording to Goldsmith, \u201cThere are good constitutional arguments in support of this possibility. There are also countervailing arguments grounded in the principle that only the agency head that appoints the officer, and not the President, can remove the officer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will leave it to others to sort that out, but raise this final question: If Trump tries to blow through the regulation and fire Mueller himself, would DOJ or Mueller accept the termination or instead challenge and litigate the purported removal?\u201d Goldsmith wrote. \u201cThat litigation would be \u2026 interesting.\u201d\n\nTo read more about the special counsel, what it means and how it will work, see our story, \u201cSpecial Counsel Q&A.\u201d\n\n\n\nU.S. Department of Justice Website. \u201cPress release: Appointment of Special Counsel.\u201d 17 May 2017.\n\nC-SPAN. \u201cTrump on special counsel: Trump responds to question about the appointment of a special counsel.\u201d 19 May 2017.\n\nThrush, Glenn and Maggie Haberman and Julie Hirschfeld Davis. \u201cTrump Stews, Staff Steps In, and Mueller Is Safe for Now.\u201d New York Times. 13 Jun 2017.\n\nBarrett, Devlin and Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima and Sari Horwitz. \u201cSpecial counsel is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice, officials say.\u201d Washington Post. 14 Jun 2017.\n\nTrump, Donald. \u201cThey made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story.
