The claim is false; the photo shows a football pitch in Russia.\n\n\n\nThis photo was published here on Facebook on August 4, 2020.\n\nScreenshot of misleading Facebook post taken on August 11, 2020.\n\nThe post's caption reads: \"The beautiful football ground is not in Europe but in Ukhrul, Manipur, India. Exceptionally beautiful!!!\"\n\nUkhrul is a town in India's northeastern state of Manipur.\n\nThe post was shared here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex found this video of the same football pitch published here on the website for US-based media agency Shutterstock.\n\nThe caption reads: \"Football field in the forest, Moscow park Meshchersky. Football, a beautiful top view of the football field, which is located in the forest.\"\n\nThe same football pitch can be seen here on Google Maps in Moscow's Meshchersky park.\n\n\n\nBelow is a screenshot of an image tagged at the same location by a Google Maps user:", "lang": "en"}
