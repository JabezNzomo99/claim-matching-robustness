Soon after, a 26-second video of members of the Muslim community raising \u2018Azadi\u2019 slogans during a mock funeral procession began circulating online. In the video, a man can be heard saying, \u201cBoth Modi and Amit Shah are dead. (\u092e\u0930 \u0917\u092f\u093e \u092d\u0948\u092f\u093e, \u0905\u092e\u093f\u0924 \u0936\u093e\u0939, \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0926\u094b\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0930 \u0917\u092f\u093e \u092d\u0948\u092f\u093e.)\u201d Social media claims suggest that the procession was taken out to celebrate Shah contracting the viral infection.\n\nVinay Choudhary, who identifies himself as a spokesperson of BJP Delhi (Youth) on Twitter, also shared this video claiming, \u201cWhen Shri @AmitShah Became Covid 19 positive, Shantidoots were organizing funeral.\u201d\n\nPosting this video on Facebook, a page called \u2018Politics Solitics\u2019 wrote, \u201cLook at their mentality. They have taken out a funeral procession celebrating Amit Shah contracting coronavirus\u201d As of this writing, the video drew more than 1 lakh views. This page has been found circulating misinformation on several occasions. Alt News has received verification requests for the video on its official mobile application.\n\nA reverse image search of a frame of the video revealed that a user had uploaded it on YouTube on July 16, 2020. Thus the video cannot represent an event that took place after Amit Shah informed that he is COVID positive. The title of the video is, \u201cModi has died \u2013 Amit Shah has died.. Tik Tok amazing new video. (\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u092e\u0930 \u0917\u092f\u093e \u2013 \u0905\u092e\u093f\u0924 \u0936\u093e\u0939 \u092e\u0930 \u0917\u092f\u093e.. \u091f\u093f\u0915 \u091f\u0949\u0915 \u0905\u092e\u0947\u091c\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0928\u094d\u092f\u0942 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b.)\n\nWe also found the same video uploaded on Facebook on December 21, 2019, on the page \u2018Young India\u2019 captioned as \u201cAmit Shah has died.\u201d\n\nAt certain points in the video \u2018Kolkata Traffic Police\u2019 can be seen written on roadside barricades. This suggests that the video was shot in December 2019 in Kolkata. Some of the people in the clip have placards in their hands and an Indian national flag. They can also be heard chanting \u2018Azadi\u2019 slogans. In December last year, the Citizenship Law was being opposed across the country with people raising slogans against Amit Shah and PM Modi. This video may have been shot during the protests.", "lang": "en"}
