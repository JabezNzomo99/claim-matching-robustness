Indian army jawans celebrating. (\u092c\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0916\u092c\u0930: \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 #\u091a\u0940\u0928 \u0915\u0947 4 \u0915\u093f\u0932\u094b\u092e\u0940\u091f\u0930 \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0930 \u0924\u0915 \u0918\u0941\u0938 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u091c\u0936\u094d\u0928 \u092e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u0947 #\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f_\u0938\u0947\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u091c\u0935\u093e\u0928),\u201d reads the caption in Hindi.\n\nThe video has been shared in the backdrop of India-China tensions which aggravated after 20 Indian army soldiers were killed in a deadly face-off in Galwan valley on June 15. The death toll on the Chinese side remains unknown.\n\nTwitter user @Real_Deepika_ also promoted the video with identical claim.\n\nA reverse image search of the video\u2019s keyframes led us to the same clip uploaded by Facebook page \u2018\u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f40\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f55\u0fb2\u0f72\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f58\u0f0d Tibet Channel\u2019 on August 27. The accompanying caption stated, \u201cTibetan Army dance.\u201d\n\nA close look at the video shows the men holding the Tibetan flag.\n\nIt is noteworthy that after the Galwan clashes in June, reports of fresh cross-border skirmish emerged on August 29-30. According to The Indian Express, \u201cWhile there have been reports about SFF being involved in the August 29-31 operation to occupy previously unoccupied heights in Chushul sector in eastern Ladakh, the Army has so far maintained an official silence.\u201d The SFF or the Special Frontier Force is a covert Indian unit comprising mostly of Tibetans in India.\n\nIn a press release on August 31, the Indian Defense Ministry stated that People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) troops violated the previous consensus amid the ongoing standoff in Eastern Ladakh. \u201cIndian troops pre-empted this PLA activity on the Southern Bank of Pangong Tso Lake, undertook measures to strengthen our positions and thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on ground,\u201d said the ministry.\n\nOn September 8, China accused India of illegally crossing the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh and firing warning shots at Chinese border personnel. The Indian army has dismissed the allegations. \u201cAt no stage has the Indian Army transgressed across the LAC or resorted to use of any aggressive means, including firing,\u201d read a press release by Ministry of External Affairs.\n\nThe viral video predates both the August 29-30 clashes and the skirmish on September 7. Tensions between both nations are ongoing. But we were unable to locate any credible media reports stating that the Indian army trespassed 4 km into Chinese territory. An old video of most likely SFF soldiers is thus viral with the false claim\n\nThe clip was also shared with a Tamil caption by Facebook page \u2018\u0b87\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf \u0b87\u0bb0\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0b9a\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd (Tamil Defense)\u2019 drawing over 5,700 likes.\n\nThe video is widely circulating on both Facebook and Twitter.", "lang": "en"}
