It took DHS many weeks to provide the requested data, indicating that the Department does not maintain the data in a readily accessible format. Moreover, the data DHS eventually supplied was incomplete and inconsistent, raising questions about its reliability. \u201cFor instance, when DHS first provided family separation data from its own information technology systems, the list was missing a number of children OIG had independently identified as having been separated from an adult. When OIG raised this issue with the Department, CBP officials stated that they believed the errors were due to agents in the field manually entering data into the system incorrectly. Additionally, the data provided from DHS\u2019 systems was not always consistent with the data on the matching table that DHS and HHS use to track reunifications. For example, the DHS systems do not contain the date (if any) that each separated child and adult were reunited, while the matching table does.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, OIG found no evidence that such a database exists. The OIG team asked several ICE employees, including those involved with DHS\u2019 reunification efforts at ICE Headquarters, if they knew of such a database, and they did not. Two officials suggested that the \u2018central database\u2019 referenced in DHS\u2019 announcement is actually a manually-compiled spreadsheet maintained by HHS, CBP, and ICE personnel. According to these officials, DHS calls this spreadsheet a \u2018matching table.\u2019 \u201cThis matching table, however, was not created until after June 23, suggesting that it is not the \u2018central database\u2019 referenced in the Department\u2019s June 23 announcement. Moreover, when the OIG team asked ICE for information that should have been accessible to ICE via the central database (e.g., information on the current location of separated children), ICE did not have ready access to the information. Instead, ICE had to request the information from HHS. DHS has since acknowledged to the OIG that there is no \u2018direct electronic interface\u2019 between DHS and HHS tracking systems.\u201d\n\nWaldman added: \u201cThe report fails to understand where the Zero Tolerance Policy took effect: in between the ports of entry. DHS and HHS share data regarding unaccompanied children. In order to enable DHS and HHS to implement the Ms. L court\u2019s reunification order, certain system modifications were required to enable the data to be used for that purpose. CBP has and will continue to accept and process claims of credible fear at the ports of entry in addition to protecting the safety and security of American communities from nefarious actors and drugs. This administration will no longer turn a blind eye to illegal immigration and will continue to refer illegal border crossers for prosecution. We are committed to enforcing the rule of law and ensuring that there are consequences for illegal actions.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
