Jon Tester (D-Mont.) asserted that \u201cevery logging sale\u201d in the state was \u201cunder litigation.\u201d The complaints also reached the radio station, as within a day, Tester\u2019s staff offered a revised statement that focused on \u201cvolume\u201d rather than sales. Marnee Banks, his spokeswoman, apologized for the original statement, but Tester himself made no comment.\n\nBut when we asked Tester\u2019s staff for evidence to back up the revised statement, they simply directed us to the U.S. Forest Service, rather than explain the data themselves. It\u2019s taken a few days to unravel the numbers, but this is a case of apples and oranges, with a few limes thrown in.\n\nLogging on federal lands is an important part of Montana\u2019s economy, with the Forest Service having the complex role of seeking to keep the forests healthy while also keeping the state\u2019s mills running. Meanwhile, environment groups in the region are active in making sure the agency does not violate key laws, such as the Endangered Species Act.\n\nA 2013 report on Montana\u2019s wood industry, published by the Forest Service, highlighted how the collapse in the housing market during the Great Recession slashed the value of Montana\u2019s wood and paper products by nearly 75 percent from 2004 to 2011. Yet Forest Service sales of wood from national forests do not appear to be greatly affected by economic conditions, according to Todd A. Morgan, director of forest industry research at the University of Montana\u2019s business school.\n\nThomas L. Tidwell, chief of the Forest Service, has told Congress that litigation does impact the ability of the agency to complete other projects. Morgan has been hired by the agency to research the actual impact of litigation on agency resources, but he said it has been difficult to make firm conclusions. (Update: the report was issued on May 5, 2015; a copy has been embedded at the end of this column.)\n\nThe Forest Service also recognizes the important role of environmental groups who challenge some of its decisions. \u201cThings should be litigated that need to be litigated,\u201d said Heather Noel, a Forest Service spokeswoman. \u201cIf there is something the Forest Service has missed, it is very healthy. We absolutely should be tested on that.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, let\u2019s examine Tester\u2019s claim about every logging sale. According to Tom Martin, a Forest Service deputy director for renewable resource management, there are 97 timber sales under contract in Montana\u2019s national forests. Of that number, just 14 have active litigation, so about 14 percent. But only four of the sales are enjoined by a court from any logging.\n\nThese four sales are the Miller West Fisher timber sale in Kootenai National Forest, two Glacier Loon sales (Swan Flats Stewardship and Lunar Kraft Stewardship) in Flathead National Forest and Meadow Creek in Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. We might question the inclusion of Meadow Creek on this list because Forest Service records show the agency itself pulled the decision without explanation. In the Flathead case, the Forest Service choose to appeal rather than accept a court decision ruling against it, thus extending the delays itself.\n\nMoreover, \u201cunder litigation\u201d is a rather expansive term because it includes projects which are still being logged even as disputes are settled in courts. (The Forest Service also sometimes counts as \u201cunder litigation\u201d areas which are not under contract or where an environmental group simply has said it intends to sue.)\n\nThe Forest Service ultimately provided a figure of 271.3 million board feet that is under contract in Montana, as of Dec. 31, 2014. Given that many of the projects being litigated are being logged, it is unclear how much has been cut already. So the only reliable figure we can use is the projected volume of the four projects that are enjoined from any logging: Miller West Fisher (15.4 million board feet), Swan Flats (6), Lunar Kraft (4.3) and Meadow Creek (2).\n\nGiven that Tester is the senior senator from Montana, his comments on litigation in Montana\u2019s national forests are embarrassingly wrong. In both statements, he was wildly off the mark. He needs to brush up on his facts \u2014 and his math \u2014 before he opines again on the subject.", "lang": "en"}
