Heller, it marked the first time that an individual right to keep and bear arms was recognized by the Supreme Court by a razor thin 5-4 vote,\" Whitbeck wrote.\n\n\"Now President (Barack) Obama is attempting to replace Justice Scalia with Judge Merrick Garland, an avowed opponent of our Second Amendment rights. While Justice Scalia voted to overturn D.C.\u2019s draconian gun laws, Judge Garland voted to uphold them,\" the chairman added, emphasizing the second sentence with bold type.\n\nWhitbeck concluded his email by asking Republicans to sign an Internet telling Virginia\u2019s U.S. senators - Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine - that Merrick \"must not be confirmed to the Supreme Court!\"\n\nScalia, who died Feb. 13, did write the majority opinion in the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 2008 ruling on . By a 5-4 vote, the high court found that Washington\u2019s gun regulations - essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home - were unconstitutional.\n\nThis Truth-O-Meter will focus on Whitbeck\u2019s claim that Garland, who has been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997, \"voted to uphold\" the handgun ban. A of conservative organizations and individuals, including Fox News commentator , have made similar statements.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Heller was because it was the first time justices ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual\u2019s right to own a firearm for self-defense. Until Heller, the widespread understanding was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service.\n\nBefore the case went to the Supreme Court , though, it was heard in the federal appeals court where Garland serves. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of D.C. appeals judges came to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional.\n\nBased on Whitbeck\u2019s claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion.\n\nGarland didn\u2019t vote on the case at all. He was not part of the three-judge panel that heard it.\n\nAfter the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the court\u2019s judges would reconsider the case and not just the three-judge panel. The court ended up , but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who voted to rehear the case.\n\nIt\u2019s misleading to say Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider Heller, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case.\n\nD.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a , joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the George W. Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual gun rights, filed an asking the Supreme Court to send Heller back to the lower court for broader definition - for example, what type of gun-ownership restrictions should remain constitutional.\n\n\"Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law,\" Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School, recently told PolitiFact National when it was a statement by O\u2019Reilly. \"Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment.\"\n\nWhitbeck said Garland \"voted to uphold\" D.C.\u2019s ban on handguns.\n\nGarland never heard the case about Washington\u2019s gun law from the bench. It was ruled unconstitutional by a panel of three other judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where Garland serves.\n\nGarland voted in favor of having the full court reconsider the case en banc - not an unusual step when a major decision bucks precedent. Randolph, a conservative judge on the appeals court who didn\u2019t sit on the three-member panel, also voted to have the decision reconsidered en banc.\n\nIt\u2019s simply inaccurate to say Garland\u2019s vote to reconsider the case is tantamount to a vote to uphold D.C.\u2019s gun restriction or to extrapolate from it the nominee\u2019s position on the case.", "lang": "en"}
