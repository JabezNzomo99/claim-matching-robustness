No, that's not true: the entire story was made up by a liberal satire website that tries to fool conservatives and Trump supporters into sharing ridiculously fake stories to teach them to be more careful about liking and sharing content without actually having read it in full. The story is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Be Best Website on November 20, 2018 titled \"BREAKING : Hillary Clinton Arrested Drunk Outside of Trump Plaza Hotel\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nState police were called to the Trump Plaza hotel yesterday on a 177 call, code for \"drunk and disorderly\", and were shocked to find that the suspect was none other than former candidate and Benghazi enthusiast Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clinton allegedly told police that she named her tequila bottle \"Chelsea\" because it was in her belly, and then shot out pretty fast. Officers Poncharello and Cipowitz responded to the call at seventeen minutes after midnight to find Mrs. Clinton \"obviously inebriated and out of control.\" Their filed report was leaked to the New York Daily Cooch.\n\nThe kind of people who like and share without clicking would only have seen this:\n\nObviously there is no news outlet named the New York Daily Cooch and the name of one of the police officers sounds a lot like one of the characters from a late seventies cop show while the other one seems to have been based on someone from a nineties cop show.\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\n'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America November 17 The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about bebest.website before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Fake Election Ballots in Georgia, Florida, Arizona Traced To Soros Compound", "lang": "en"}
