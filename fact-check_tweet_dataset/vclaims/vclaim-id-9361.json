Both the Times and The Washington Post have seen spikes in audience and subscribers. (The Post announced at the end of 2016 it is \u201cprofitable and growing.\u201d)\n\nBy the way: Traffic to The Fact Checker is at an all-time high. We shattered our own traffic record in January 2017, when our monthly unique visitor count was 50 percent higher than the previous monthly record, set in October 2016.\n\nThe 109 number only refers to people who were traveling at the time the order was signed. After we issued Four Pinocchios, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer admitted the number did not refer to people who were detained and held.\n\nMoreover, Trump inaccurately blames Delta. Trump\u2019s order, signed on the evening of Friday, Jan. 27, sparked delays, confusion and protests in airports that night and throughout the weekend. Delta\u2019s computer glitch on the night of Sunday, Jan. 29, led to cancellations that night and into Monday morning \u2014 days after the first protests and delays due to Trump\u2019s order.\n\nIt typically takes weeks or months to get a tourist visa to enter the United States. It certainly would take months for \u201cbad guys,\u201d presumably with records that would take longer for background checks, to receive a tourist visa.\n\nTrump is referring to the estimated 1,250 (not \u201cthousands\u201d) refugees and asylum seekers that the United States, under President Barack Obama, agreed to accept from an Australian detention center. Refugees and asylum seekers who arrive illegally by boat in Australia are called \u201cillegal maritime arrivals.\u201d They can apply for two types of temporary visas, and some may qualify to apply for permanent residency.\n\nThe vast majority of federal dollars that flow to colleges and universities arrives in the form of student loans and grants to cover the cost of attendance. That money, which is dispensed through what\u2019s known as the Title IV program, does come with conditions that schools must meet, mainly involving the quality of the education. To remain in the program, schools, for instance, can\u2019t have scores of students defaulting on their loans year after year. Or, in the case of career colleges, they can\u2019t lie about the number of students landing jobs after graduation. Trampling on First Amendment rights, as Trump has accused Berkeley of doing, are not grounds to be kicked out of the program.\n\nTrump always uses too-high an estimate, $150 billion, and makes it sound like the United States cut a check to Iran. But this was always Iran\u2019s money. Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe, because of international sanctions over its nuclear program. The Treasury Department estimated that once Iran fulfilled other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.\n\nTrump seems to be citing a segment of Sean Hannity\u2019s show, during which Hannity questioned whether there was a paid effort to galvanize protesters showing up at airports in the wake of Trump\u2019s immigration executive order. But there\u2019s no evidence there were paid protesters at airports. There were reports that a group called \u201cDemand Protest\u201d was paying people to protest against Trump on the day of his inauguration, but Snopes.com debunked that claim.", "lang": "en"}
