Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won\u2019t come in.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Asimov ever said or wrote this statement. It might actually come from a commencement address given by \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d actor Alan Alda.\n\nA prolific science fiction and popular science writer, Asimov wrote nearly 500 books over his lifetime. He is best known for his science fiction novels, including the \u201cFoundation\u201d series and \u201cI, Robot.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of the quote attributed to Asimov in the Facebook post in his written works. A search of Boston University\u2019s comprehensive Asimov manuscript collection didn\u2019t turn up anything resembling the expression either.\n\n\u201cAlan Alda should receive credit for the words he spoke in 1980,\u201d states the website Quote Investigator. \u201cBased on current evidence the attribution to Isaac Asimov is spurious.\u201d\n\nAlda, an actor best known for his role as Capt. Benjamin Franklin \u201cHawkeye\u201d Pierce in the popular television series \u201cM*A*S*H,\u201d said the statement during a commencement speech at Connecticut College in 1980, according to Quote Investigator. It has been attributed to Asimov since at least 2002, though it\u2019s unclear how the statement first got linked to him.\n\nThe Oxford Essential Quotations also ascribes the saying to Alda, noting that it is often misattributed to Asimov.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
