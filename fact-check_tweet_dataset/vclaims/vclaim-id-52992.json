Biden \u2014 including a piece of text claiming that he was a Confederate soldier who owned slaves in the 1800\u2019s \u2014 was widely circulated on social media:\n\nThis is not a photograph of Joe Biden\u2019s great-grandfather, and the claim that \u201cJoseph J. Biden\u201d was a Confederate soldier who owned slaves is unfounded.\n\nWhile this meme went viral in June 2020, it\u2019s actually been circulating for more than a decade. The earliest iteration we could find was posted to the Blogspot blog Truth First back in 2008, when Biden was running for vice president alongside then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. That posting included no supporting information to back up its claims, and in the 12 years since its posting, no sources to support this claim have emerged.\n\nWe were also unable to find any mention of a great-grandfather named Joseph J. Biden in any of the material we examined while researching Biden\u2019s family tree. In 2016, the Irish Family History Research Center traced the Irish side of Biden\u2019s family tree back six generations. On his side, then-vice president Biden\u2019s great-grandfathers were James Finnegan, born in Ireland in 1840, and Edward Francis Blewitt, born in 1859.\n\nThe Vice President\u2019s great-great grandfather, Owen Finnegan, left in the late 1840\u2019s for America. Previous research undertaken by genealogist Megan Smolenyak identified Owen\u2019s marriage in 1839 to Jean Boyle in county Louth. Owen and Jean\u2019s first four children were born here, including the Vice President\u2019s great-grandfather, James Finnegan born 1840. The Vice President\u2019s earliest traceable direct ancestor is his great-great-great grandfather Edward Blewitt (ca. 1795-1872), born in north county Mayo, Ireland. Our first documentary evidence for Edward Blewitt is in the parish records for Kilmoremoy, in the picturesque town of Ballina. The town\u2019s name is derived from the Irish \u2018mouth of the river or ford\u2019 and it is located at the head of the river Moy overlooking Killala Bay. It was here that we know that at least three children were born to Edward Blewitt and Mary Mulderg, including the Vice President\u2019s great-great grandfather, Patrick Blewitt baptised in 1832, when the couple were living in Patrick Street, part of Garden Street, in the heart of the town. It is disappointing that parish registers for Kilmoremoy only start in 1823 for baptisms and marriage\u2019s preventing us from determining Edward Blewitt\u2019s exact year of birth.\n\nDetails about the other side of Biden\u2019s family are less clear. Still, there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that Biden\u2019s great-grandfather was a Confederate soldier and slave owner. Biden\u2019s father\u2019s family came from England, and they arrived in America (specifically in Baltimore, Maryland) sometime in the 1840s. A passage from David Hagan\u2019s \u201cNo Ordinary Joe: The Life and Career of Joe Biden\u201d gives some insight into Biden\u2019s family history:\n\nBiden\u2019s father\u2019s family has been traced back to an Englishman from Sussex, William Biden, who was born around the same time as Edward Blewitt and who died in Baltimore in the 1840s. Elsewhere on that side of the family, there were more Irish and French ancestors, which explains Biden\u2019s unusual middle name, Robinette. According to family folklore, the Robinettes, Joe Biden\u2019s grandmother\u2019s family, crossed the Atlantic with Lafayette, the young Frenchmen who served as a General in the American army during the War of Independence, and never returned. Biden\u2019s paternal grandfather, Joseph H. Biden, was from Baltimore and worked as a salesman in the oil industry.\n\nUSA Today identified Biden\u2019s great-grandfather as George T. Biden, not Joseph J. Biden as claimed in the meme, who was born in 1867, two years after the end of the Civil War. Biden\u2019s great-great grandfather was named Joseph H. Biden (some genealogy sites list him as Joseph J.H. Biden,) and he lived during the Civil War. However, Biden\u2019s great-great grandfather was on a draft registration list for the Union Army, not the Confederacy, and the Maryland State Archives (where Biden\u2019s great-grandfather and great-great grandfather lived) do not list any Bidens as slave owners.\n\nThe Maryland State Archives \u201cLegacy of Slavery\u201d website does list a few \u201cRobinettes\u201d who owned slaves during the 1830s. However, it\u2019s unclear how (or if) this family is related to the Bidens. The former vice president\u2019s middle name, Robinette, is the same as his grandmother\u2019s maiden name, Mary Elizabeth Biden (Robinette). However, we\u2019ve been unable to trace a direct line from Biden\u2019s grandmother to the Robinettes on Maryland\u2019s Legacy of Slavery website. While it\u2019s possible that the former vice president\u2019s mother\u2019s mother\u2019s parents\u2019 parents\u2019 are listed on this website, it\u2019s also possible that the two-generation gap between Mary Elizabeth Biden (Robinette) and the Robinettes on this list of slave owners is filled with non-paternal or maternal ancestors.\n\nRegardless, this image does not show the former veep\u2019s great-grandfather \u201cJoseph J. Biden,\u201d a confederate soldier who owned slaves. So who does this image show?\n\nWhat About the Image?\n\nThe image at the center of this meme does not show a member of the Biden family. We reached out to Kurt Luther, an associate professor of computer science at Virginia Tech and founder of \u201cCivil War Photo Sleuth,\u201d an online tool that helps users identify soldiers in old Civil War photographs, for help unmasking the individual in this photograph.\n\nThe man in this photo is not Biden\u2019s great-grandfather \u201cJoseph J. Biden.\u201d This image actually shows a man named Richard Young Bennett, a Confederate soldier who served with Mississippi\u2019s 2nd Infantry during the Civil War. Furthermore, Luther was unable to find any Confederate soldiers with the surname \u201cBiden\u201d in various Civil War soldier databases he examined.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Joe Biden\u2019s ancestry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can confirm by searching a couple of Civil War soldier databases that there was no Confederate soldier with the surname Biden.\u201d\n\nThe viral meme claims that an image shows Joseph J. Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s great-grandfather, slave owner, and confederate soldier. But, that isn\u2019t the case. The man in this photograph is actually a Civil War soldier named Richard Young Bennett who has no connection to the Biden family.\n\nFurthermore, Biden\u2019s paternal great-great grandfather was George T. Biden, not Joseph J. Biden, and we found no \u201cBidens\u201d in the databases examined regarding Civil War soldiers or slave owners. While there are members of the \u201cRobinette\u201d family listed in Maryland\u2019s database of slave owners from 1830, it\u2019s unclear how this family is related (if at all) to the former vice president.", "lang": "en"}
