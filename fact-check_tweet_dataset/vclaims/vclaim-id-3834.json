So it\u2019d be interesting to see where those figures come from because it\u2019s certainly not figures that organisations like the [Muslim Council of Britain] and Runnymede recognise.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s figures seem to be correct for England, at least according to the 2011 census. The alternative 6% figure, from the Muslim Council of Britain, isn\u2019t measuring the same thing.\n\nClaim accurate according to new analysis of relatively old data\n\nThere were around Muslim women aged 16 or older living in England as of the 2011 census. Of these, almost exactly 190,000, or 22%, said that they could speak English \u201cnot well\u201d (152,000) or \u201cnot at all\u201d (38,000).\n\nThese 190,000 Muslim women are part of the 863,000 people in total who said they couldn\u2019t speak English well or at all that year.\n\n90,000 Muslim men, or 10%, said the same.\n\n6% alternative may not count all Muslims who can\u2019t speak English well\n\nAn alternative figure of 6% rather than 22% was offered by a contributor to the Today programme, citing the Runnymede Trust. When we asked, Runnymede referred us to a report by the Muslim Council of Britain, rather than anything it published itself.\n\nAt the time this report was published, in January 2015, the analysis the government used today wasn\u2019t available. The don\u2019t break down English language ability by religion.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain at people living in England and Wales who were born in Pakistan or Bangladesh. It found that one in four reported speaking English not very well or not at all.\n\nThe Council with the total Muslim population to get a figure of 6%. It says that those born in Pakistan or Bangladesh group of people represents \u201cthose most likely to be Muslim and also most likely to struggle with the English language\u201d.\n\nSo for the 6% figure to be accurate, we\u2019d have to assume that no Muslim apart from those born in Pakistan or Bangladesh struggles with English.\n\nThe analysis also isn\u2019t specific to \u201cwomen\u201d. It\u2019s taking people of both genders, aged three and up. So it doesn\u2019t rebut the government\u2019s claim.\n\nWe updated our overall \"verdict\" to make it clear what people responding to the census said about their level of English.", "lang": "en"}
