The same post appears almost word for word on plenty of other websites, too.\n\nFacebook users flagged the story as possibly being bogus, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to curtail fake news in users\u2019 news feeds.\n\nThe post said Harvard chancellor Malcolm Little said Malia, 18, \"was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends.\" The school\u2019s strict drug policy meant she was out, the article read, and the Obama family was considering filing a discrimination suit.\n\nAgain, this story is fake, because there haven\u2019t been any reports that Malia Obama was kicked out. But the post does acknowledge something that would make expulsion difficult \u2014 she isn\u2019t going to school there yet.\n\nThe White House announced in 2016 after she was accepted that Malia Obama would take a gap year before enrolling in the fall of 2017. What has she been up to since then? Things a teen with a year off would do, probably, like hang out with boys in Manhattan.\n\nAs for the post\u2019s other details, Harvard does prohibit drugs and alcohol on campus, where current students would face penalties (expelling the former first daughter seems unlikely in any event). Harvard doesn\u2019t have a chancellor, it has a president, and her name is Drew Gilpin Faust.\n\nMore importantly, the post originally appeared April 9 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we\u2019ve previously checked.\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn\u2019t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\n\nPoint being, Malia wasn\u2019t caught smoking weed in a Boston hotel, and didn\u2019t get booted from a school she isn\u2019t even attending yet. Don\u2019t expect to see her having to settle for Brown anytime soon.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
