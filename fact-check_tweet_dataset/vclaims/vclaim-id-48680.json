It further states that if the infected person drinks a lot of water and gargles with warm water & salt or vinegar it eliminates the virus. Vishvas News investigated and found reports that refuted the viral claim. As per health experts, you can soothe a sore throat by gargling with warm water, but it isn\u2019t a cure of coronavirus.\n\nA viral post shared on Facebook by a page named \u0926\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0901 \u0915\u0947 \u0918\u0930\u0947\u0932\u0941 \u0928\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0916\u0947 reads: \n\n\u201cCoronavirus remains in the throat for four days before it reaches the lungs it and at this time the person begins to cough and have throat pains. If he drinks water a lot and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus. Spread this information because you can save someone with this information.\u201d The post has a great engagement and has been shared by 7.2K users till date. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by reading the comments on the viral post. Many users commented on the post that it is fake.\n\nAs per the viral post, coronavirus stays in throat for 4 days. When we investigated we found that a report by World Health Organization (WHO) which states most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days.\n\nWe further searched and found a report by World Health Organization (WHO). As per WHO, there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from novel coronavirus infection. However, there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. But, that doesn\u2019t mean that it can cure coronavirus.\n\nAs per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Vimal N., Pharmacovigilance Officer, Ministry of AYUSH. He refuted the claim by saying, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a cure for coronavirus. \n\nthere is limited evidence that gargling with hot saline water can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. But, that doesn\u2019t mean that it can cure coronavirus.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
