We will be meeting with the IBA on May 2 at 4 pm to initiate discussions on our many pending demands. But as of date, there is no such notification from the RBI and we are yet to begin any fresh talks on the matter of 5-day week,\" said Uttagi.\n\nThe last notification (Click here) regarding working hours and bank holidays were issued by the RBI on August 28, 2015.\n\n\"All scheduled and non-scheduled banks \u2013 public, private, foreign, cooperative, regional rural and local area banks \u2013 will observe public holiday on second and fourth Saturdays from September 01, 2015; and will observe full working days on Saturdays other than second and fourth Saturdays,\" said the RBI notification dated August 28, 2015.\n\nUttagi said that while the IBA and RBI were open to their demand for a 5-day week, the private banks proved to be the roadblock. He expects all stakeholders to take a sympathetic view considering that RBI and central government employees enjoy a 5-day week schedule, except for certain departments. The unions have pointed out the options of electronic banking channels to tide over inconvenience to consumers over the weekend.\n\nBut the government is yet to give its final approval for the move. The banking industry is also a divided lot as many are of the view that a 5-day week will be a operational nightmare and will result in loss of business. Some have also argued that while consumers in the cities will adapt, this move will impact the steps government has taken towards financial inclusion and ensuring better banking for those in semi urban and rural areas where electronic banking is not as widely used as in the cities.\n\nSo relax. You can enjoy finishing pending banking work on the 1st and 2nd Saturdays as scheduled.\n\nBOOM will fact check and bust fake news.
