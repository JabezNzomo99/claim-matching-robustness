Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House portrays an infighting senior team at each other\u2019s throats, and a president too narcissistic and distracted to be capable of governing.\n\nIs it accurate? Many details are simply wrong. Whether the larger narrative is true is a different question.\n\u2022 Wolff said then-Speaker of the House John Boehner resigned in 2011; it was actually 2015.\n\u2022 Wolff said Trump didn\u2019t know who Boehner was in 2016 (\"Who\u2019s that?\"), even though Trump tweeted about Boehner\u2019s reputation for crying in 2015.\n\u2022 Wolff said Wilbur Ross was Trump\u2019s choice for labor secretary; it was actually commerce secretary.\n\u2022 Wolff misspelled the name of Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen (not \"Hillary Rosen\").\n\u2022 There are many typos, as well as wrong word choices (\"pubic\" instead of public; a dream \"differed\" instead of deferred).\n\u2022 Wolff reported that Washington Post reporter Mark Berman was at a Four Seasons breakfast when it was likely another person named Mike Berman.\n\u2022 Wolff writes that the infamous Steele dossier, a private compendium of Trump\u2019s history with Russia, suggested that Trump was being blackmailed by Russia. A more restrained interpretation of the dossier suggests Trump could be subject to blackmail, but not that he was the actual victim of it.\n\nA bigger problem with Fire and Fury, however, is that by any standard of sound journalism it has big problems with transparency and sourcing.\n\nOne of the book\u2019s major storylines is a fight to the political death between Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Trump\u2019s family \u2014 most specifically daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Each team fights for influence with the president and attacks their rivals through leaks to the press and outright insults of each other to anyone who would listen.\n\n\"In the Oval Office, in front of her father, Bannon openly attacked (Ivanka Trump). \u2018You,\u2019 he said, pointing at her as the president watched, \u2018are a f------ liar.\u2019 Ivanka\u2019s bitter complaints to her father, which in the past would have diminished Bannon, were now met by a hands-off Trump: \u2018I told you this is a tough town, baby.\u2019 \"\n\nHow does Wolff know this scene happened? We don\u2019t know. Was he there? It\u2019s not clear. Did Bannon tell him? Did Ivanka Trump tell him? Did President Trump tell him? There\u2019s no way to know, and many scenes in the book are like this.\n\nWolff writes in the book\u2019s introduction that he conducted interviews with more than 200 people and that he was able to enter the White House often, apparently allowed in to observe because nobody was savvy enough to bar him.\n\nCertainly one of Wolff\u2019s sources is Bannon; Bannon is quoted extensively in the text and most of the drama seems to revolve around Bannon\u2019s attempts to keep Trump pure, i.e. not moderate his politics, and make liberals as angry as possible. It also seems likely Wolff spoke with other advisers like Kellyanne Conway and Katie Walsh directly.\n\nAfter that it gets hazy. Did he interview Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump? They are seldom quoted directly, though Wolff claims to know their motivations and personal insecurities. Wolff describes Kushner\u2019s internal thoughts when Kushner watched Bannon in a high-profile 2016 appearance at CPAC, a conservative conference: \"Thin-skinned, defensive, on guard, (Kushner) perceived Bannon\u2019s speech as a message sent directly to him. Bannon has just credited the Trump victory to everybody else. Kushner was certain he was being taunted.\"\n\nWolff has resisted detailed questions about his sources and has instead emphasized multiple interviews and his many visits to the White House. \"The real intention of this book is to have readers sit with me on the couch and watch what\u2019s going on in the West Wing,\" Wolff said on Meet the Press in response to questions on sourcing from host Chuck Todd. \"I went into this with absolutely no agenda whatsoever. I have no particular politics when it comes to Donald Trump. This is really all about human nature.\"\n\nThe fly-on-the-wall, you-are-here atmosphere that pervades Fire and Fury will undoubtedly sell books. But like other books before it \u2014 the 2010 political book Game Change comes to mind \u2014 Fire and Fury hardly seems a move in the right direction for well-sourced, evidence-based journalism. Instead it\u2019s a stew of mysteriously sourced dramatic scenes.\n\nThe lack of sourcing is a problem because it means evidence is given a back seat to narrative oomph. It encourages people to suspend their critical thinking skills and follow their emotions into a pleasing narrative. That narrative might be true or it might not be, and it\u2019s almost impossible to independently evaluate.\n\nThe people who take time to read the book for themselves will find a devastating portrait of Donald Trump. Trump is portrayed as totally out to lunch, with such a short attention span that he\u2019s incapable of reading policy briefs much less of analyzing a problem or making a well-informed decision. Trump is shown constantly watching cable TV, frustrated and confused by the fact that he doesn\u2019t receive widespread approval. His staff is well aware of his shortcomings and wonders just how long they can continue the illusion that Trump is capable of governing.\n\nThe book\u2019s depiction of the reasons behind the firing of FBI director James Comey is particularly brutal. In the book's telling, Trump fires Comey because his family is terrified Comey\u2019s investigation of Russia will lead to investigations of the Trump and Kushner family finances. And though Wolff\u2019s sourcing for this isn\u2019t exactly explicit, the idea is actually supported by an on-the-record interview Trump gave to the New York Times in which he said special counsel Robert Mueller should stay away from his family\u2019s finances and keep the investigation confined to Russia.\n\nBannon\u2019s take on this is operatic, detailed and one of the most fascinating passages of the book: \" \u2018Ehhh \u2026 ehhh ...ehhh!\u2019 screeched Bannon, making the sound of an emergency alarm. \u2018Don\u2019t look here! Let\u2019s tell the prosecutor what not to look at!\u2019 \" Bannon then gives an extended riff on Trump\u2019s vulnerability to the Mueller investigation, the professional backgrounds of the prosecutors, the exposure of Trump\u2019s family and Trump\u2019s own risk of being removed from office. \"They\u2019re sitting on a beach trying to stop a Category Five,\" Bannon concludes.\n\nIt\u2019s scenes like this that have driven Bannon to issue something of a mea culpa. He recently apologized specifically for his criticism in the book of Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr. for taking a meeting with Russian nationals; he also stepped down from his post as executive chairman of Breitbart News. Trump on Twitter has derided the book as boring and untrue and promoted himself as a \"stable genius.\" And the White House team has taken to cable to attack Wolff and defend the president\u2019s competence.\n\nLike much of the Trump presidency, battles over political power seem to go hand in hand with battles over the nature of ultimate truth. Whether the big picture shown in Wolff\u2019s book is accurate will be answered as time passes and the Trump presidency unfolds.", "lang": "en"}
