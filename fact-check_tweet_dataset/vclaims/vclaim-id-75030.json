Then she got paid $42,000 by the very corporations she allowed to sell your personal info,\" claimed the Arizona Democratic Party on a marthamcsally.forsale website.\n\nThe website lists different types of personal information \"exposed by Rep. McSally,\" including Social Security number, credit card numbers, children\u2019s information, smartphone app data and internet browsing history.\n\nMcSally is vying for the Senate seat vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring when his term ends early January 2019. Other Republicans also running are Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward. The primary election is Aug. 28.\n\nDid McSally vote \"to let companies sell\" internet data without users\u2019 consent and \"got paid $42,000\" by the corporations allowed to sell such data? The Arizona Democratic Party\u2019s claim has some elements of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\n\nMcSally voted to repeal internet data rules that had not taken effect. Her vote was not \"to let\" companies sell data (they were already legally allowed to do that); it was to halt new rules requiring companies to seek users\u2019 explicit consent before doing so.\n\nCompanies don\u2019t generally sell internet data, they rather sell access to users by allowing advertisers to target specific demographics, telecommunications experts told PolitiFact.\n\nMcSally \"got paid $42,000\" by corporations allowed to sell users\u2019 personal information? The Arizona Democratic Party bases this claim on campaign contributions McSally received after the March 28 vote. Federal Election Commission data shows that political action committees for telecommunications companies and their employees donated about $42,000 to McSally\u2019s campaign or an affiliated political action committee.\n\nMcSally\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair called the Arizona Democratic Party\u2019s claim \"absurd and offensive.\"\n\n\"This rule favored organizations like Facebook. It gave them more access to data than other companies, and did nothing to protect Arizonans' information from them,\" Sinclair said.\n\nCongress, including McSally, in March 2017 voted to get rid of internet privacy rules the Federal Communications Commission created during the Obama administration. They were scheduled to take effect December 2017 under the Trump administration.\n\nThe rules were intended to give consumers more control over how internet service providers (ISPs), such as Verizon or Comcast, used their data. They required ISPs to obtain explicit information from their customers before using and sharing their web browsing history and other \"sensitive information,\" such as Social Security numbers, precise geolocation data and financial or health information. (Facebook is not an ISP, so the new rules didn\u2019t apply to Facebook.)\n\nArizona\u2019s Flake challenged the rules under the Congressional Review Act of 1996, arguing that Obama\u2019s FCC went too far and that internet privacy issues have been under the FTC\u2019s purview, not the FCC\u2019s.\n\nThe vote removed the FCC\u2019s authority to regulate the sale of consumer data, said Nicol Turner Lee, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings Institution.\n\n\u2018Voted to let companies sell your internet data to the highest bidder without your consent\u2019\n\nThis part of Arizona Democratic Party\u2019s claim ignores several key facts. Before the vote, companies were already legally allowed to sell internet data, but were not doing so to begin with, experts said.\n\n\"The new privacy rules for broadband internet access service providers hadn\u2019t gone into effect so, practically speaking, data collection practices remained the same,\" said Brent Skorup, a senior research fellow in the Technology Policy Program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.\n\nThe main issue involved \"de-identified\" browsing data (data that cannot reasonably be linked to a particular consumer, computer, or device) and whether it was considered sensitive when broadband internet access service providers had it, Skorup said.\n\n\"The Obama FTC in 2012 said no, de-identified browsing data isn\u2019t sensitive; the Obama FCC in 2016 said yes, it is sensitive,\" Skorup said. \"Congresswoman McSally\u2019s vote was, effectively, a vote to restore the Obama FTC\u2019s privacy policies and halt the Obama FCC\u2019s proposed policies.\"\n\nSkorup emphasized that ISPs cannot and could not collect sensitive user data \u2014 such as health information, financial information, children\u2019s information, Social Security numbers, and geolocation information \u2014 without express consumer consent.\n\nThe vote caused Americans to lose whatever potential privacy rights they would have and should\u2019ve had, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit advocating for consumers on digital privacy and consumer protection issues.\n\nYet internet service providers aren\u2019t selling or giving users\u2019 data to advertisers, Chester said. They keep the data and use it to deliver targeted ads, he said.\n\n\"It\u2019s not about selling your data, it\u2019s about selling access to you,\" Chester said.\n\nInformation generally isn\u2019t sold by ISPs, but rather those seeking to advertise could go to ISPs with a demographic they are hoping to target, and ISPs could then use either aggregate or otherwise anonymized data to send advertisements to the right groups of people, said Doug Brake, director of telecom policy at Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank.\n\n\"The FTC has detailed guidelines on the types of consent that are necessary for different types of data, with more sensitive data requiring express opt-in consent. \u2026 From what we know, ISP policies are all consistent with FTC guidelines, and they remained in place through the passing and repeal of the Obama-era FCC rules,\" Brake said.\n\n\"Got paid $42,000 by the very corporations she allowed to sell your personal info\"\n\nThe Arizona Democratic Party based this claim on contributions made after the March vote to McSally\u2019s campaign by political action committees tied to telecommunications companies and their employees. (Federal law generally prohibits corporations from making contributions to candidates for federal offices.)\n\nThe Arizona Democratic Party pointed to a March National Journal article citing data from the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance data at OpenSecrets.org.\n\n\"Over the course of her career, McSally has taken nearly $100,000 in campaign contributions from sources such as AT&T, Verizon, and Cox Communications, all of whom provide internet services,\" the article said.\n\nSpecifically after the vote, Federal Election Commission filings show McSally received $37,000 in such contributions and that Comcast contributed an additional $5,000 to a political action committee affiliated with McSally, the National Journal reported.\n\nContributors to McSally for Congress since the March vote include Cox Enterprises PAC, Verizon Communications Inc. Political Action Committee, and Comcast Corporation & NBCUniversal Political Action Committee.\n\nThe Arizona Democratic Party launched a website that claimed, \"Congresswoman Martha McSally voted to let companies sell your internet data to the highest bidder without your consent. Then she got paid $42,000 by the very corporations she allowed to sell your personal info.\"\n\nMcSally\u2019s vote did not allow companies to sell internet data \u2014 that was already legally allowed. Still, experts said companies generally don\u2019t sell data to third parties such as advertisers, rather use the data to deliver companies\u2019 ads. McSally\u2019s campaign received about $42,000 after the March vote from political action committees tied to telecommunications companies. McSally also received contributions from those groups prior to the vote.", "lang": "en"}
