This crucial project will reduce the journey \u2026 to around 20 minutes, with trains running every two minutes.\u201d\n\nNSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian promises if she\u2019s re-elected work will start next year on a fast new $6.4 billion Metro West rail line from Sydney\u2019s west to the city. March 3, 2019.\n\nThe NSW government has promised voters in western Sydney a new train line that will cut their city commute to 20 minutes. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck has examined the Premier\u2019s claims that the new metro line will \u201cmore than double\u201d current capacity and cut the journey to \u201caround 20 minutes\u201d with trains running \u201cevery two minutes\u201d.\n\nAAP FactCheck found the Premier\u2019s claims to be somewhat false but they contained more than one element of truth.\n\nThere is no reference to the Premier\u2019s 20-minute Parramatta to Sydney CBD journey claim, or any specific journey times, in the Sydney Metro West Project Overview document dated March 2018. [2]\n\nThe project document states: \u201cCurrently, the fastest trip between Parramatta and Wynyard takes between 31 and 33 minutes on the [existing] T1 Western Line. Sydney Metro West will deliver a significantly faster journey time.\u201d [2] [Page 19]\n\nThis is supported by the NSW government\u2019s trip planner website which shows the fastest morning peak hour rail journey from Parramatta to Sydney\u2019s CBD Wynyard station on the existing network takes 31 minutes. [3]\n\nA spokesman for the Premier told AAP FactCheck \u201c20 minutes is an aim\u201d and the government would not know until the final business case was completed what the exact travel time from Parramatta to the city would be.\n\nNSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance\u2019s spokesperson said the 20-minute journey was the government\u2019s \u201ctarget\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pipedream, it\u2019s doable,\u201d the spokesperson told AAP FactCheck.\n\nRegarding the Premier\u2019s claim Metro West will \u201cmore than double the existing rail capacity between Parramatta and the Sydney CBD\u201d the Metro West project document states it will \u201ceffectively double\u201d capacity. [2] [Page 11]\n\nIt further states the existing T1 Western line which services Parramatta moves around 40,000 commuters during peak hour. The new Metro West line will move more than 40,000 people an hour [2] [Pages 11 & 13]. These combined figures show the existing T1 Western line and the new Metro West line will more than double capacity.\n\nThe Premier\u2019s claim that trains on the new line will run every two minutes is at odds with the project overview document.\n\nWhile the project overview reiterates the Premier\u2019s claim the network has the capacity to run trains every two minutes in each direction, it states the new line will run trains every four minutes during peak times and every 10 minutes in the off peak [2] [Pages 3, 5, 30, 41].\n\nThe Sydney Metro website, which details the greater Sydney Metro scheme, also says trains will leave every four minutes on the proposed Metro West line. [4].\n\nRunning trains on the new line every four minutes is also a lesser service than that currently offered on the existing line between Parramatta and Sydney\u2019s CBD. Trip planner shows trains leave every three minutes during peak times from Parramatta and every 15 minutes during off peak on the existing line. [3]\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes only one of the Premier\u2019s three claims are true. Her claim the proposed new line will double capacity is correct. The claim the new line will take 20 minutes is an aim. The Premier\u2019s final claim the new line will run trains every two minutes differs with the project overview.", "lang": "en"}
