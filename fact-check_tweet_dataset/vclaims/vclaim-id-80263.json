The parliamentarian, the government, and a representative from the programme said the notification being circulated is fake and no such appointment has been made.\n\nThis Facebook post along with several others carrying the same image of the alleged appointment letter and a photo of PTI MP Maleeka Bokhari claim the parliamentarian has been appointed \u201cas chairperson of the Benazir Income Support Programme\u201d.\n\nThis report by the broadcaster Lahore News also said that Bokhari had been appointed as the chairperson of the programme.\n\nIt added that Bokhari was a sister of Prime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s close friend and aide Zulfi Bokhari -- a claim that the MP later denied in a tweet.\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) is a federal financial aid programme that provides unconditional cash transfers to impoverished residents. It was created in 2008 and named after the late prime minister Benazir Bhutto.\n\nBokhari wrote in a tweet that she has not been given the job and also said she was not related to Zulfi Bokhari.\n\n\u201cI want to categorically put it on record that I have not been appointed as Head of BISP. I am also not related to Zulfi Bokhari.
