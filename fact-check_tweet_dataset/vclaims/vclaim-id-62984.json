Video via a friend living there. Prayers for the safety of all.\u201d\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to it is FAKE.\n\nWhen we extracted the keyframes of the video through InVid and put them through Reverse Image Search, we found the video in question on YouTube dated May 4, 2019. The title of the video read, \u2018Cyclone FANI Destroying Clips 25\u2019. With that information, we ran another Reverse Image Search along with the keywords, \u2018Cyclone\u2019 and \u2018Fani\u2019 and found a video by The Economic Times dated May 3, 2019. The video showed the destruction caused by Cyclone Fani which hit Odisha in May 2019. The description of the video read, \u2018The extremely severe cyclonic storm \u2018Fani\u2019 or the \u2018Hood of Snake\u2019 made landfall around 8 am in Puri, with roaring winds flattening huts, enveloping the pilgrim town in sheets of rain, and submerging homes. Though the \u2018extremely severe\u2019 cyclone unexpectedly weakened into \u2018very severe\u2019 cyclonic storm in a matter of few hours, it left a trail of devastation in large parts of coastal Odisha, with the seaside pilgrim town of Puri being the worst hit.\u2019 Hence, the above information proves that the video being circulated shows the destruction caused by cyclone Fani in Odisha last year, and is not at all connected to the recent Cyclone Amphan that hit West Bengal.
