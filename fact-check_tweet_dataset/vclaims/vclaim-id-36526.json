There is currently \u201cno specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,\u201d according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIt\u2019s worth reiterating again: Beware of posts on social media claiming to offer tips or cures for the novel coronavirus.\n\nOne of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar \u201celiminates\u201d the virus.\n\nThe viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, \u201cbefore it reaches the lungs,\u201d the coronavirus \u201cremains in the throat for four days\u201d and that drinking a lot of water \u201cand gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization, however, notes that \u201cto date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,\u201d which causes the COVID-19 disease.\n\nWhile saline water or water with vinegar is sometimes used to help soothe a sore throat, \u201cit doesn\u2019t kill the virus,\u201d Charles Dela Cruz, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, told us.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not rinsing it away so it doesn\u2019t go to your lungs,\u201d Dela Cruz, also director of the university\u2019s Center for Pulmonary Infection Research and Treatment, said in a phone interview.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that symptoms \u2014 often fever, cough or shortness of breath \u2014 appear within 14 days of exposure. As for actual advice, Dela Cruz said \u201cthe key is to limit getting infected.\u201d He emphasized health officials\u2019 guidance that people should frequently wash their hands with soap and water; avoid touching their faces; and avoid large crowds and close contact with people who are sick.
