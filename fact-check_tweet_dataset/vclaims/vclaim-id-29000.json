America is great because America is good. If America ever ceases to be good America will cease to be great.\u201d\n\nThis quotation does not appear in any of Tocqueville\u2019s writings.\n\n\u201cDemocracy in America,\u201d Tocqueville\u2019s most famous work, is often referenced when discussing early American society. Written in two volumes published in 1835 and 1840, it recounts Tocqueville\u2019s nine months spent traveling and observing the U.S.\n\nIt has also been cited as the source of this quote, which has been shared for decades by major political figures, including Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.\n\nHowever, the remarks do not appear in \u201cDemocracy in America,\u201d or any of his other writings.\n\nRobert Tracy McKenzie, a history professor at Wheaton College, told The Daily Caller that the quote is spurious. \u201cIt has been debunked numerous times over the last 67 years or so \u2013 no serious Tocqueville scholar believes that he wrote anything remotely similar, nor does it capture the essence of what he believed about the success of democracy in the United States,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nJohn Pitney Jr., a professor at Claremont McKenna College, debunked the spurious quotation in 1995, saying in The Weekly Standard, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that politicians are using a knockoff product when the real thing is so fine. Democracy in America offers profound analyses of the roles of religion, morality, and voluntary action, though its insights are subtler than the purple prose of the counterfeit.\u201d\n\nThe quote dates back to at least 1922, according to etymologist Barry Popik, though he found a variant appearing in print as early as the 1880s.\n\n\u201cI sought everywhere in vain for the secret of their success, until I entered the church,\u201d reads this variation. \u201cIt was there, as I listened to the soul-equalizing and soul-elevating principles of the Gospel of Christ, as they fell from Sabbath to Sabbath upon the masses of the people, that I learned why America was great and free, and why France was a slave.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie believes the last two lines originated even earlier, with a variant written by Andrew Reed and James Matheson, English ministers who wrote about their travels to the U.S. in the 1830s. \u201cAmerica will be great if America is good. If not, her greatness will vanish away like a morning cloud,\u201d reads their account, published in 1835.\n\n\u201cHere, almost certainly, is the long-lost germ of the \u2018words to live by\u2019 that Americans have long attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville,\u201d said McKenzie.", "lang": "en"}
