{"title": "Disabled people in work", "subtitle": "The number of disabled people in work has increased over the last four years.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-2377", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/disabled-people-work/", "vclaim": "The number of disabled people in work\u2014aged between 16 and 64\u2014has risen from 2.9 million in 2013 to 3.5 million this summer. The employment rate has also increased over that period from 44% to 49%. In other words, just under half of disabled people aged 16-64 are now in work.\n\n2013 is the earliest comparable data we have. It\u2019s still correct comparing with May 2015 (when the Conservative party won a majority) and July 2016 (when Theresa May became Prime Minister).\n\nA person is counted as disabled if they have a health condition lasting or expected to last a year or more that limits their ability to carry out day-to-day activities.\n\nOver the same period the number of non-disabled people in work also increased but by a smaller proportion, from 25.8 million to 27.2 million. The employment rate for non-disabled people increased from 77% to 81%.\n\nThese numbers show us a net increase. They can\u2019t tell us exactly how many people have entered the workplace or left it.\n\nThere are older figures than 2013, but these aren\u2019t comparable to the latest set. In the older data, disabled means the person has a long term health condition which affects the amount or type of work they can do. The way people were asked about this changed at various points over the last decade.", "lang": "en"}
