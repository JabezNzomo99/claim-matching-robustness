Biden was answering a question about fracking when the blood suddenly became noticeable. As he turned away from the camera to take a question about China\u2019s role in carbon emissions, the blood in his eye was easy to spot.\u201d\n\nThe right-leaning Washington Examiner published an article with the headline \u201cBiden\u2019s Eye Fills With Blood During CNN Climate Town Hall\u201d and reported that:\n\n\u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden appeared to have a blood vessel burst in his left eye while participating in CNN\u2019s town hall on climate change. A broken blood vessel in the eye, also known as a subconjuctival hemorrhage, can be caused by several things, including high blood pressure, bleeding disorders, blood thinners, or even excessive straining.\u201d\n\nSimilar reports were published by the Daily Express and the right-leaning Townhall website. Many reports were accompanied by footage that appeared to show blood gathering in the corner of Biden\u2019s left eye during the debate:\n\nThe video footage was authentic, and blood did indeed gather, internally, in the corner of Biden\u2019s eye during his appearance at the televised town hall. However, it\u2019s not clear what caused that to happen, and much of the reporting that alluded to \u201chealth concerns\u201d appeared to have been based on speculation.\n\nThe incident began around 26 minutes into Biden\u2019s appearance at the debate, which can be viewed on the CNN website. The blood becomes visible around 50 seconds into the following clip, which was posted to Twitter by CNN itself:\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what caused the incident. Some news reports speculated that the footage showed the aftermath of a blood vessel bursting in Biden\u2019s eye, something that is relatively quite common and \u201cusually harmless,\u201d according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\nBurst blood vessels in the eye can be caused by straining, coughing or sneezing, but can also be linked to underlying health issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or the use of blood-thinning medications. Complications from the use of contact lenses can also cause blood vessels in the eye to break.\n\nWe asked Biden\u2019s campaign to clarify what had happened, and what the causes were, but we did not receive a response in time for publication.", "lang": "en"}
