They stem from an old satirical article on the website Bustatroll.org, and taken out of context to appear real ( here ).\n\nThe text of the satirical article reads: \u201cAt a recent $5000-a-plate fundraising event for orphaned San Francisco lemurs, Pelosi, drink in hand, raged about the greatest generation and their place in America today: \u2018These people are leeches. All they do is suck from the public teat. Take, take, take\u2026Social Security recipients are nothing more than burdens on society.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe article header is clearly labelled \u201cSatire and/or conservative fan fiction\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cAbout Us\u201d of Bustatroll\u2019s page says: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site\u2019s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you\u2019re still having an issue with that satire thing.\u201d\n\nFurther down it reads, \u201cCall it whatever you like. Just don\u2019t call it something it isn\u2019t. Don\u2019t email us asking for a \u201csource.\u201d Don\u2019t inform us that our stories aren\u2019t true. We have so many disclaimers now that the disclaimers are satirical. We make sure the words \u201csatire\u201d or \u201cfiction\u201d appear in EVERY category BEFORE the story. Twice.\u201d\n\nDespite the disclaimers, images with these fabricated quotes continue to circulate online as if the story were true.\n\nA senior aide to Speaker Pelosi confirmed to Reuters via email that the claim was false.\n\nFalse: Nancy Pelosi did not refer to Social Security recipients as leeches, or burdens on society; the false claims stem from a satirical article\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
