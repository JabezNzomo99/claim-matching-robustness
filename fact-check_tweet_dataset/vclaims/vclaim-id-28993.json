A bipartisan agreement had raised the possibility of the first congressional salary increase in years, but concerns about the optics have reportedly stalled that proposal.\n\nYet a viral post spread on Facebook, and questioned by some FactCheck.org readers, erroneously claims that Congress has approved exorbitant pay raises while simultaneously denying an increase in Social Security benefits.\n\n\u201cCongress rejects $336 monthly increase in SS/SSDI, Approves $8,872 monthly increase for themselves,\u201d the viral post, shared by thousands of Facebook users, reads. \u201cTELL YOUR CONGRESSMEN vote NO!\u201d\n\nFirst of all, Congress does not control the annual cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits. We\u2019ve debunked that misconception repeatedly.\n\nSince 1975, the annual adjustment for Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits, as we\u2019ve written, has been determined by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. When there is no increase in the CPI-W for the specified time period, there is no cost-of-living adjustment.\n\nThe COLA for 2019 that went into effect in January raised benefits (which include Social Security Disability Insurance or \u201cSSDI\u201d) by 2.8 percent.\n\nAs for congressional salaries, legislators have been considering allowing an automatic pay raise of 2.6 percent for 2020. That would mean an additional $4,500 annually \u2014 not \u201c$8,872 monthly\u201d \u2014 for most members, who currently make $174,000 (congressional leaders earn more). Amid dissent from some members, House Democratic leaders recently postponed a decision on whether to allow the raise to go through.\n\nThe automatic adjustment formula was established by a 1989 law and is \u201cbased on changes in private sector wages and salaries as measured by the Employment Cost Index,\u201d according to the Congressional Research Service. The percentage increase cannot surpass that for \u201cGeneral Schedule\u201d federal employees. It automatically goes into effect unless Congress statutorily denies it, which it has done every year since 2009.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, the CRS notes, members\u2019 current salaries represent a 15 percent decrease in pay since the last adjustment was applied in January 2009.\n\nDeBonis, Mike and Paul Kane. \u201cHouse Democratic leaders postpone vote on part of spending bill over congressional pay raise.\u201d Washington Post. 10 Jun 2019.\n\nFerris, Sarah, Heather Caygle and Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez. \u201cDems to yank bill to raise congressional pay after backlash.\u201d Politico. 10 Jun 2019.\n\n\u201cSalaries of Members of Congress: Recent Actions and Historical Tables.\u201d Congressional Research Service. 17 May 2019.", "lang": "en"}
