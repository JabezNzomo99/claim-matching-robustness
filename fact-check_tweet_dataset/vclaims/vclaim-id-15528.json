A Twitter handle, @sir_jenishpatel, was among those who circulated the images. He is followed by BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga and his post received over 500 retweets and more than 700 likes.\n\nFrom what it seems, the photographs are viral on WhatsApp as well.\n\nA simple reverse-image search on Google reveals that the images do not pertain to a recent event. The incident took place on September 25, 2016, when a group of around 10 youths, suspected to be Akalis workers, attacked a Congress bike rally in Ajnala, Punjab. Congress party workers had reportedly taken out a rally against drugs.\n\nAccording to Hindustan Times, \u201c\u2026the bike rally, led by District Congress Committee (rural) president Gurjit Singh Aujla, reached the community centre at Guru Ka Bagh. The youths allegedly started beating Congress workers with rods and baseball bats. \u201cThe attackers belonged to the ruling party, alleged Aujla in a press conference.\u201d\n\nCongress MP Sidhu is not in the photograph. The man on the bike with the pink turban was \u201cCongress (rural) district president Gurjeet Singh Aujla\u201d, per a report by The Tribune.\n\nABP News had also uploaded a video of the brawl.\n\nOld images and videos have recently resurfaced on social media with the claim that they represent a recent event. Alt News has debunked several such cases \u2013 a video of alleged EVM malfunction during 2017 UP civic polls was viral as that of Lok Sabha elections, a 2017 video from Gujarat was shared as PM Narendra Modi\u2019s rally in Hyderabad, Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s funeral procession was viral as PM Modi filing nomination papers.", "lang": "en"}
