You can read the latest advice on the NHS website here.\n\n\n\nA number of posts that make the same claims about the symptoms and prevention of the new coronavirus (that causes Covid-19) have been shared on Facebook.\n\nThe same text, claiming to be from a member of the Stanford hospital board, has also been shared. Stanford University has since announced that it was not the source of the misinformation.\n\nThe claims are a mixture of accurate and inaccurate. While the post does include some basic advice that is worth following, it also makes claims which could lead people to mis-diagnose themselves, and suggests ways of preventing infection that won\u2019t work.\n\nHolding your breath to test for Covid-19 and sipping water to protect against the virus won\u2019t work\n\nThe post claims that by the time you\u2019re likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19 your lungs are likely to be \u201c50% fibrosis\u201d and recommends a test attributed to Japanese doctors. It says to hold your breath for 10 seconds to see if you have the new coronavirus (the post claims that if you can\u2019t hold your breath that long then you know you have the virus.)\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that holding your breath for 10 seconds can show if you have the new coronavirus.\n\nLung fibrosis, which is scarring in the lungs, is a potential outcome in severe cases of Covid-19. Professor Ben Neuman, Chair of Biological Sciences at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, told Full Fact that while it is true that the infection could cause fibrosis, holding your breath would not necessarily diagnose if you have this.\n\nIn addition, the post claims that sipping water regularly will prevent infection by driving the virus into your stomach where it will be killed by the acid.\n\nThis is incorrect. Sipping water regularly does not prevent infection and there have been cases of the virus passing into people\u2019s intestines and affecting them.\n\nWe have written about both these claims in more detail before.\n\nThe post\u2019s ten \u201cimportant announcement[s]\u201d are a mix of true and false\n\nWe have written about these in more detail here.\n\nThe first two claims are about potential symptoms of Covid-19:\n\nA runny nose and sputum (phlegm coughed up from the lungs) are not as common as other symptoms of Covid-19, such as a high temperature and a new, continuous cough. But having a runny nose and sputum doesn\u2019t rule out having Covid-19.\n\nThe term pneumonia describes the swelling of lung tissue. It\u2019s usually caused by a bacterial infection, and has been seen in Covid-19 patients. One of the most common symptoms of Covid-19 is a dry cough. But as we\u2019ve already said, having a runny nose doesn\u2019t rule out Covid-19.\n\nOther claims relate to factors that may affect the survival of the new coronavirus:\n\nBecause the virus is relatively new to us, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about it, like the exact temperatures it can withstand (although there have been cases recorded in countries that often have temperatures above 27 degrees). We\u2019ve written about this claim in more detail before.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the new virus, similar to other coronaviruses, is transmitted by droplets produced by coughs and sneezes. How far droplets spread when you sneeze depends on a range of factors, including humidity and temperature, but can be as far as several meters.\n\nThe NHS says you should cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve, but not your hands, when you sneeze, and put used tissues in the bin and wash your hands afterwards.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how long it can survive on surfaces, although we\u2019ve written more about that here. Washing your hands well with soap is good advice to prevent you picking up germs from surfaces. Cleaning advice from the UK government for people staying at home because of suspected Covid-19 symptoms can be found here.\n\nWe haven\u2019t found any reliable source saying exactly how long the virus can survive on fabric. For households with suspected Covid-19, Public Health England has advised that laundry items can still be washed together and according to manufacturer's instructions, but warned against shaking dirty laundry \u201cto minimise the possibility of dispersing virus through the air\u201d.\n\nThe post makes four more claims about how to prevent catching the virus, including warnings to drink warm not cold liquids, that the virus can live on hands for 5-10 minutes, and that gargling with salt water will prevent Covid 19.\n\nWe can\u2019t find any scientific evidence that warm water can cure or prevent diseases caused by viruses, although hot drinks can be a comfort to those suffering with coughs and colds. Washing your hands thoroughly, and often, is also good advice. It\u2019s not clear exactly how long the virus can \u2018survive\u2019 on your hands, especially not down to the minute. But the post is right to mention that rubbing your eyes, mouth or nose is problematic if you haven\u2019t washed your hands, because these areas are a prime entry point for viruses and bacteria.\n\nGargling with salt water is recommended by the NHS for adults who have a sore throat, but only to relieve symptoms once you have caught it, not as a preventative measure. The World Health Organisation says that there\u2019s no evidence saline can prevent Covid-19. We have written more about this claim here.\n\nThe viral post also lists four symptoms of Covid-19, which are generally accurate\n\nThese are a roughly accurate description of the common symptoms of Covid-19, although some patients may experience other symptoms and the timing of those symptoms may differ.\n\nThe CDC says that a sore throat has been reported \u201cin some patients\u201d. More commonly, symptoms include fever, a cough, muscle pain or fatigue and shortness of breath. In more severe cases Covid-19 can cause pneumonia. The NHS does not mention nasal congestion that \u2018feels like drowning\u2019 as a specific symptom for Covid-19.\n\nIf you experience either of the two major symptoms of Covid-19 the NHS says to look out for (a high temperature or a continuous cough) you should stay at home for seven days and you do not need to contact their 111 service. If your fever is gone after seven days you can return to your normal routine (even if you still have a cough), but if you still have a fever remain at home until your temperature returns to normal levels.\n\nNew advice published on 18 May now says that anyone experiencing loss of taste or smell (known as 'anosmia') should also self-isolate.\n\nIf these symptoms don\u2019t go away after seven days, if you can\u2019t cope with them at home or if you get worse then use the NHS online 111 coronavirus service. If you can\u2019t get the help you need there then you should call the 111 phone service.\n\nIf you have a medical emergency, you should still call 999 as you would normally.", "lang": "en"}
