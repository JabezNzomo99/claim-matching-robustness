Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said \u201cowning guns is not a right,\u201d contrary to what a viral meme claims.\n\nSince joining Congress in January, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has used her position to support gun control measures \u2014 co-sponsoring legislation requiring universal background checks, for example, and advocating for bans on bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons. (She\u2019s also no supporter of the National Rifle Association.)\n\nBut there is no evidence that the freshman lawmaker said that gun ownership \u201cis not a right,\u201d despite a claim in popular posts shared throughout social media.\n\n\u201cOwning guns is not a right, if it were a right it would be in the constitution,\u201d reads the viral quote wrongly attributed to Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nWe could find no record of Ocasio-Cortez ever making that statement. We did find, however, that as a candidate last year, she recognized the Second Amendment to the Constitution \u2014 which the Supreme Court has found \u201cprotects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\u201d\n\nOn her 2018 campaign website, the New York Democrat said she supported \u201ccommon-sense gun legislation,\u201d citing New York as an example of a city with \u201ctough gun laws\u201d that don\u2019t violate the Constitution. \u201cEven in the United States, cities and states with strong gun laws have managed to cut gun violence significantly without running afoul of the Second Amendment,\u201d her campaign platform read.\n\nThousands of social media users have helped spread the false quote through repeated posts on Twitter and Facebook since at least January.\n\nThe posts include a photo of Ocasio-Cortez from her interview with PBS in July, before she was elected to her seat in Congress.\n\nWe wrote about one inaccurate claim she made during that interview \u2014 about the cause of low unemployment in the U.S. \u2014 but the interview transcript shows she didn\u2019t make any claims about gun rights.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nBerman, Corey, and Robert Farley. \u201cOcasio-Cortez Wrong on Cause of Low Unemployment.\u201d FactCheck.org. 18 Jul 2018.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, Alexandria (@AOC). \u201cYou know, instead of training children, teachers, houses of faith, & concertgoers to prep for being shot, we could just: -Pass Universal Background checks (#HR8!) -Disarm domestic abusers -Mandate safe storage -Ban bump stocks, semiautos, & high cap mags designed to kill people.\u201d Twitter. 21 Mar 2019.\n\nU.S. House. \u201cH.R.8, Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.\u201d (as passed by the House 27 Feb 2019.)", "lang": "en"}
