The judiciary has 5,598 staff and parliament has 9,940.\n\u2022 None He said parliament\u2019s travel and hospitality budget was KSh10 billion. The most recent audited figure is KSh4.64 billion. \n\n\n\nAs Kenya\u2019s parliament finalises the country\u2019s budget forecasts, its allocation to the judiciary has left a prominent lawyer unimpressed.\n\n\u201cLook at this MONKEY business\u2026 the entire Kenyan judiciary with 10,000 employees covering 47 counties has a budget of KSh18 billion. Parliament with only 800 employees has 40 billion out of which 10 billion is for foreign/local trips/entertainment...what a shame!!!\u201d\n\nthis to his 660,000 followers in March 2019.\n\nHe was responding to\n\nthat parliament would get some KSh39.5 billion in the 2019/20 financial year, and the judiciary just KSh18.9 billion. The executive arm of government\u2019s share was capped at KSh1.77\n\n, which he later\n\nAfrica Check contacted Abdullahi for the source of his figures. He told us the parliamentary staffing number came from his sources in parliament. He did not give a source for judicial staffing.\n\n\u201cI was told by the people who work there that employees of parliament cannot reach 1,000.\u201d He said he wrote the tweet \u201coff the cuff after I talked to one or two guys. There is a deliberate policy to starve the judiciary of funds.\u201d\n\nCuts to the judiciary\u2019s budget have drawn past\n\nfrom the chief justice, David Maraga. But is Abdullahi\u2019s ire justified? We checked his numbers.\n\nKenya\u2019s judiciary had 5,598 staff as at June 2018, according to the\n\nThese were 155 judges, 513 magistrates and kadhis and 4,930 judicial staff, ranging from court clerks and researchers to technicians and messengers.\n\nBut the judiciary requires 9,568 employees to operate at its peak, the report says \u2013 3,970 more than its current staff.\n\nThe report adds that the judiciary is \u201coperating at 58.5% of its optimum staffing\u201d.\n\nand secretary of the\n\u2022 None 6,740 constituency staff in the 290 constituencies and 47 county offices\n\u2022 None In the senate, 940 staff serve 47 elected senators, and 64 serve nominated senators\n\u2022 None 1,022 police officers are attached to lawmakers in both houses \n\n\n\nAbdullahi is therefore also off the mark on this one.\n\nKSh2.95 billion on domestic travel in the 2017/18 financial year, the office of the\n\nreported. Foreign trips cost KSh1.32 billion while the bill for hospitality was KSh370.3 million. This adds up to KSh4.64 billion.\n\nThe figure increased significantly in 2018/19, with KSh2.59 billion\n\nforeign travel, KSh4.99 billion for domestic travel and KSh577.8 million for hospitality. The total is KSh8.16 billion.\n\nHowever, these are unaudited figures. Parliament\u2019s most recent audited figure for travel and hospitality is KSh4.64 billion. The lawyer\u2019s claim of KSh10 billion is therefore incorrect.\n\nBudget estimates for the 2019/20 financial year\n\nData from the controller of budget shows that the judiciary spent\n\non employees in 2017/18.
