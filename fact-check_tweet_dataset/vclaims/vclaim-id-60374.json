The post further claims that drinking hot water and sun exposure will do the trick. The post in attributed to UNICEF. Vishvas News investigated earlier and found that the viral message is fake.\n\nA post that has resurfaced on social media reads: Coronavirus Information Source: UNICEF. IF THE VIRUS IS EXPOSED TO A TEMPERATURE OF 26 \u2013 27 DEGREES CELCIUS IT WILL BE KILLED, AS IT DOES NOT LIVE IN HOT REGIONS.

She said: \u201cUNICEF didn\u2019t send out such a message. This is a fake message falsely attributed to UNICEF.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the viral claim, she quoted: \u201cThe sensitivity of this virus to temperature is not known as yet. It is important to rely on only trusted sources of information like the official website of Health ministry, WHO website or UNICEF websites. Fake posts and misinformation should not be shared on social media without verifications.\u201d\n\nAs per the CDC report, \u201cIt is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.\u201d\n\nThe complete fact check of the claims can be read here.\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named SurigaoCity Pulis.
