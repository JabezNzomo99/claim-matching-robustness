BOOM has earlier fact-checked Bharat News for peddling misinformation. Click here to read our fact-check.\n\nAn excerpt from the blog post in Bangla reads, \"Amartya Sen babu has been critial of Modi's decisions and have found himself in controversies, after speaking against them. According to him after banning the Chinese apps, India will not be able to see profit. And the Indian economy will be faced with a huge economic loss. And China will not suffer any losses after the ban of apps in India.\" Several netizens have shared screenshots of the post to misleadingly claim that Sen has commented on the ban of PUB-G and Indian economy.\n\nBOOM did not come across any recent news reports covering comments by Amartya Sen on the government of India's decision to ban Chinese mobile applications and its impact on the Indian economy. Relevant keyword searches showed that Sen has not commented on PUBG ban and the Indian economy. \n\n\n\nIndia banned 118 mobile applications linked to China, including PUBG Mobile Lite, virtual private network (VPN) services and some productivity apps such as camera scanners on September 2. The release issued by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology stated the apps were banned as they have been found to engage in activities against India's sovereignty, security, defence and public order. This is the third wave of bans on Chinese apps by the government, starting from June.
