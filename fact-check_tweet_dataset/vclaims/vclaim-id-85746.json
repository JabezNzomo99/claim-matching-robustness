In a chapter called \u201cThe Cincinnati Kid,\u201d Trump gave himself credit for identifying Swifton Village as an investment property. \u201cIn college, while my friends were reading the comics and the sports pages of newspapers, I was reading the listings of FHA foreclosures,\u201d Trump claimed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I found out about Swifton Village.\u201d He claimed that the property sold for $12 million and that there was little debt left on the property, meaning the Trump Organization made at least $6 million on the deal.\n\nBut in true Trumpian form, many of the book\u2019s details were exaggerated. \u201cMore than anyone else I have ever met, Trump has the ability to convince himself that whatever he is saying at any given moment is true, or sort of true, or at least ought to be true,\u201d the book\u2019s ghostwriter, Tony Schwartz, told the New Yorker in 2016. (Schwartz declined to comment for this fact check, saying he will no longer discuss Trump.)\n\nThe tale of Trump and Ohio begins at a foreclosure auction in 1964, when Donald Trump was a senior in high school. It was Fred Trump, the president\u2019s father, who purchased Swifton Village for just under $5.7 million \u2014 a fraction of what it had cost to build a decade earlier. The 1,168 unit apartment complex, once the largest in Cincinnati, had fallen into disrepair. It was riddled with vacancies and by all accounts was dilapidated.\n\nBut Fred Trump liked a challenge. Reports say he took out a mortgage of $5.75 million to cover the purchase cost and the renovations required to entice residents back, particularly those who were willing to pay more in rent. On Tuesdays, he would fly to Cincinnati, inspect the week\u2019s progress and then fly back to New York in time for dinner.\n\nAccording to \u201cTrump Revealed,\u201d by our colleagues Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, Donald Trump worked at Swifton Village for the summer between high school and college \u201cfor a week at a time to take care of menial tasks.\u201d Roy Knight, a Swifton maintenance man remembered, \u201cHe\u2019d get in there and work with us. He wasn\u2019t skilled, but he\u2019d do yard work and clean up \u2014 whatever needed to be done.\u201d Once he started college, he\u2019d occasionally join his father\u2019s Tuesday excursions.\n\nReports suggest that the younger Trump was progressively more involved with the property as he got older, but it\u2019s unclear how often he visited. We didn\u2019t find evidence he ever lived in Cincinnati. When we asked Trump biographer Gwenda Blair about the possibility, she laughed. We reached out to the Trump Organization and the White House for clarification on this point, but they did not respond.\n\nBuilt as part of a postwar plan, the multistory garden apartments were intended to house people of limited means. In \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Trump paints Swifton Village as a \u201cvery troubled place,\u201d where residents skipped out on rent and were \u201cvery poor,\u201d having come down from the \u201chills of Kentucky.\u201d He describes evicting existing residents to attract \u201ca better element.\u201d Alongside the physical renovations, a 1969 lawsuit alleged the Swifton Land Corp., which was run by the Trumps, employed racial quotas.\n\nWhen the elder Trump bought Swifton Village, the surrounding neighborhood, Bond Hill, began to experience a radical racial demographic shift, which Fred Trump\u2019s makeover could not hold off. Despite his best efforts, vacancy was on the rise and it was clear that the time had come to sell. So, three years after the lawsuit, in 1972, the Trumps sold Swifton Village to Prudent Real Estate Investment for a reported $6.75 million in cash.\n\nBeyond the mortgage, it is unclear how much the Trumps invested in the property\u2019s renovation and operations, as well as taxes. And without that, the cost of their legal fees and the amount they raised from renters, it is difficult to pin down just how much profit, if any, they may have made. Setting aside those factors and others, just subtracting the mortgage ($5.75 million) from the sale price ($6.75 million), the Trumps would have cleared only a million dollars, far from the $6 million windfall cited in \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\n\nWhile the younger Trump, then 26, was formally involved with his father\u2019s real estate company by this point, reports have suggested it was Fred Trump who was the force behind this deal, not his son. That being said, Trump biographer Blair does credit Donald Trump with sealing the deal.\n\nSuccess is relative. Did the apprentice Donald Trump learn things from his time working at and around Swifton Village? Most likely. Did the Trumps make $6 million? Almost certainly not. Of course, without knowing the final cost of repairs or legal expenses and the rental income, there is no way to be sure. Setting profit aside, it is a stretch for the president to claim his personal run in Ohio as \u201ca great success.\u201d Even if there was some profit at the end, it was not incredible.\n\nUndoubtedly, a young Donald Trump spent time at the property: People who worked there have spoken about it, but none of their quotes or stories suggest that he was solely in charge or that he ever lived in Cincinnati.
