The interview is entitled, \u201cDuterte\u2019s Philippines: An Ally of the New Paradigm.\u201d\n\nThe closest statement to the supposed quote is when the senator, a retired army colonel and former chief of the Criminal Law Division under the Judge Advocate General's Corps, recalled how Duterte came into power and the effect of drugs in the Philippines.\n\nAt the 4:29 mark, Black says, \u201cThe people of the Philippines elected President Duterte by a tremendous margin and they wanted law and order and he gave it to them. [...] Consequently, to rule the Philippines, you have to rule with a very firm hand and that is what the Filipino people have chosen, to have a very strong ruler. \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the photo used in the meme is from the Associated Press showing Black during a 2016 debate during a session at the Capitol in Virginia.\n\nThe meme also contains a \"stamp\" featuring Emily Padilla, former Interior undersecretary, now Agrarian Reform** undersecretary. Padilla\u2019s official page once shared a meme featuring ex-US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and a supposed quote from her giving praise to Duterte. Rappler reported in a fact-check article in September that this Haley \"quote\" is a hoax.", "lang": "en"}
