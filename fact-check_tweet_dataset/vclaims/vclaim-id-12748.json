The allegation does not involve any potential federal crime. The FBI\u2019s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers.\u201d\n\nDespite that, viral posts on social media have alleged that an \u201cFBI report confirms none of the Kavanaugh accusations were true. None of them.\u201d\n\nThe FBI conducted a supplemental background investigation to review allegations against Kavanaugh made by two women: Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 the California professor who publicly testified that a drunk, teenage Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party in the 1980s \u2014 and Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale with Kavanaugh and claimed that he exposed himself to her.\n\nThe supplemental investigation, which lasted several days, included interviewing 10 individuals about those allegations, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The bureau provided its report documenting the interviews to the White House, which then provided it to the Senate. The Judiciary Committee said the supplemental investigation showed there was \u201cno corroboration of the allegations made by Dr. Ford or Ms. Ramirez.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the FBI\u2019s interviews did not substantiate the accusations by Ford or Ramirez \u2014 but they also did not show the accounts to be false.\n\nThe FBI investigation did not probe other allegations, including the accusations put forth by Julie Swetnick and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti.\n\nWeeks after Kavanaugh was confirmed to the court, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, referred Swetnick and Avenatti to the FBI for investigation for allegedly making \u201cmaterially false statements\u201d to the committee.\n\nGrassley later made a similar referral to the FBI to investigate another woman, Judy Munro-Leighton. Grassley said in his referral letter that Munro-Leighton contacted the committee and claimed to be the \u201cJane Doe\u201d who had submitted an earlier, anonymous written accusation against Kavanaugh. Munro-Leighton, as we\u2019ve previously reported, admitted she in fact was not the woman who wrote that letter and had not even met Kavanaugh.\n\nThose referrals relate only to Swetnick and Munro-Leighton, not to Ford or Ramirez.\n\nOn Nov. 2, the Senate Judiciary Committee released a lengthy report examining all of the accusations. It said that committee investigators \u201cfound no witness who could provide any verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations brought against Justice Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nKeith, Tamara. \u201cDemocrats Want FBI To Investigate Kavanaugh Allegations.
