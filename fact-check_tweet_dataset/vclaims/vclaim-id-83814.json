The photo is actually a stock image that has been used repeatedly as far back as 2011.\n\nThe image, which was posted to Facebook on December 5, has a caption saying:\n\n\u201cToday, around 20 people claiming to be representing the conservative faction of BANSER NU staged a rally in front of the Saudi Arabian embassy building on Jl HR Rasuna Said, Kuningan, South Jakarta. Masses from NU say in their speech that they demanded the embassy to stay away from Indonesia\u2019s domestic affairs, and ask Saudi\u2019s ambassador to leave Indonesia. Organisers of this protest are very dumb because they asked Saudi envoy to leave Indonesia. Mr. SAID AGIL SIRADJ, are you not ashamed? Saudi Arabia has greatly contributed to Indonesia. What if Saudi Arabia cut bilateral ties with Indonesia???\u201d\n\nBANSER is the paramilitary wing of Indonesia\u2019s largest Muslim organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU).\n\n\u201cSAID AGIL SIRADJ\u201d is a reference to NU\u2019s chairman Said Aqil Siroj.\n\nA banner saying \u201cSaudi Arabia is cruel\u201d can be seen in the image, which had been shared more than 1,700 times.\n\nThe image is a stock photo from Indonesian news outlet Tempo.\n\nTempo has repeatedly used the exact same photo to illustrate reports about Indonesian migrant workers in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAFP found at least four Tempo articles with the photo, such as this one dated March 5, 2011, which is headlined: \u201cFigures of Indonesian migrant workers going to Saudi Arabia plunged significantly\u201d.\n\nThe photo is captioned: \u201cHundreds of people from the Indonesian Workers Association (ATKI) stage a rally in front of the Saudi Arabian embassy building in Jakarta\u201d.\n\nIt was taken by Tempo photographer Eko Siswono Toyudho.\n\nMultiple other Tempo articles have used the image, for example here in November, 2010, here in December 2010, and here in April 2011.", "lang": "en"}
