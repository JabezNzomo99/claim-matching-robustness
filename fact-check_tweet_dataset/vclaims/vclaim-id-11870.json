The image is from the Times Food website where it was captioned as Keema Samosa Recipe.\n\nThe image of the samosa seemed to have been clearly photoshopped and imposed in the original image. Below is the comparison of the two images in which the samosas have the exact same edges and folds.\n\nTajinder Pal Singh Bagga who is the spokesperson of the Delhi unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on an indefinite hunger strike demanding the removal of the Congress leader Kamal Nath as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh for his alleged role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.", "lang": "en"}
