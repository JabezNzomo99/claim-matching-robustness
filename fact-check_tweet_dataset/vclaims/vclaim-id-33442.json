The photo, however, is not from India.\n\nIn the tweet, Nath who is the president of the Madhya Pradesh Congress, took a dig at the Chief Minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who had made a statement in 2017 claiming that roads in his home state were in better state than those he had seen in Washington DC, USA, during a visit there.\n\nClick here to view an archived version of the tweet.\n\nThis is not the first time this photo has gone viral in India to criticize a government for poor performance.

(Viral Sach: This folding road is not of Bihar)\n\nFormer deputy chief minister of Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav had tweeted about it at the time.\n\nThe same image has also been shared as that from Indonesia and Nepal.\n\nWhile BOOM was not able to find a credible news source to pin point where exactly the photo was taken the earliest instance of it online dates back to June 24, 2016 where it has been used in the context of Bangladesh.
