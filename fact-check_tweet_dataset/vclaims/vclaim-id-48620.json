It claims:\n\n\"If you are in Las Vegas and you get a knock on your door from NV Power, 2020 Census or CVD-19 testers, do not open your door. They are robbing people at gunpoint.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Police warned that \"some internet perpetrators are preying on panic\" about COVID-19 \"by posting false news, rumors or scams,\" and asked citizens to \"check their facts from reliable sources before spreading the rumor.\"\n\nThe news release also warned citizens of \"unverified rumors\" about people posing as utility workers or COVID-19 testers trying to get into homes.\n\nBut as of March 24, 2020, no incidents like those described in the post had been reported to police, officer Larry Hadfield told PolitiFact.\n\nHe said police are not aware of any legitimate utility or census workers going door to door in Las Vegas.\n\nAcross the nation, census takers will visit some homes in April 2020 to conduct quality-check interviews or deliver paper questionnaires, and then the next month to help collect responses, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which offers instructions on how to verify that someone is working for the census.\n\nA Facebook post warns that armed robbers are going door to door in Las Vegas posing as utility workers, census workers and COVID-19 testers.\n\nLas Vegas police said they have received no such reports and have warned people not to believe internet rumors. We rate the claim False.", "lang": "en"}
