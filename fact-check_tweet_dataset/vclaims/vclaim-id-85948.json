As we have noted, this previously obscure data point has seeped into GOP talking points as the more closely watched unemployment rate showed steady improvement in 2013. The official rate is now 6.7 percent, or about 10.3 million unemployed.\n\n\u201cIn fact, if the same percentage of people were in the labor force today as there were in 2009, our unemployment rate would be an astronomical 10.8 percent,\u201d Black wrote. \u201cThis is in stark contrast to the administration\u2019s prediction that his 2009 \u2018stimulus\u2019 legislation would have lowered unemployment to just 5 percent today.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney earned Two Pinocchios for making a similar claim about the unemployment rate. The problem is that the worker participation rate has declined in large part because of the retirement of the Baby Boom generation, so you cannot easily blame President Obama for long-running demographic trends. (Still, this is not just a demographic story: The number of Americans working or actively seeking work has actually fallen faster than demographers had predicted; the participation rate for workers between ages 16 and 54 fell sharply during the recession and still has not recovered.)\n\nAs for the administration\u2019s \u201cprediction,\u201d we have noted repeatedly that this was a projection issued on January 9, 2009 \u2014 before Obama even took the oath of office\u2013by two aides, Christina Romer, the nominee to head the Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, an incoming economic adviser to Vice President-elect Biden.\n\nThe 14-page report thus was not an official government assessment, or even an analysis of an actual plan that had passed Congress, as Black claims. Instead, it was an attempt to assess the impact of a possible $775 billion stimulus package and how much of a difference it would make compared to doing nothing. The administration certainly embraced the paper in later testimony, yet we have never found any citation of the unemployment projection by any administration official.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics does show that there are nearly 92 million Americans out of the workforce. But dig into the numbers and it is clear that it\u2019s silly to say all of these people are \u201con the sidelines\u201d and need action from the president and the Congress.\n\nEssentially, it means everyone above the age of 16 who is not working. The BLS breaks it down even further, and it quickly becomes clear that the vast majority of these people are retired or simply are not interested in working, such as stay-at-home parents.\n\nAdd that up, along with the 10.3 million who are unemployed, and then maybe you could say there are 21 million people who are \u201con the sidelines\u201d of the job market. But the other 70 million people have permanently left the work force.\n\nTom Flanagin, press secretary for Black, said that \u201cwe certainly did not mean to mislead, as the piece was written from beginning to end from the standpoint of labor force participation, not the total number of unemployed.\u201d He added that \u201cour point being in this piece that today\u2019s unemployment rate is misleading as it is not reflective of a broader problem in today\u2019s economy, which is that so many people have given up looking for work. We believe that if the President and the Senate were to act on our House passed jobs bills, we would create an environment where businesses would be in the position to expand and we would see the size of our labor force.\u201d\n\nBlack may have not intended to mislead, but she certainly did so by using the 91 million figure in a wholly inappropriate manner. She did not only say that 91 million people were not in the labor force, but she said these people were \u201con the sidelines\u201d and would benefit from government action. She cannot with a straight face argue that all of those people want a job; in fact, the vast majority are simply retired. She only barely escapes Four Pinocchios because this is a BLS figure.", "lang": "en"}
