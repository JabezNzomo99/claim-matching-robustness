The BBC quoted a local politician as saying that the work was not about removing the trees, but about replacing the rotten linden trees with new maple trees.\n\nThere is no mention of 5G in that article, or any others we could find about the incident.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen no large scale, or replicated (meaning similar results have been found by other groups) scientific studies that suggest 5G kills trees or any research into the impact of 5G on trees in general. There is evidence that trees of a certain height can affect radio frequency signals. A report from the Department of Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, and Ordnance Survey, about 5G planning, mentions trees (amongst other structures like bus stops, billboards and high walls) as something that could interfere with signals.\n\n5G is the next generation of wireless network technology, following on from 4G. One of the many uses of this will be to provide faster web access from mobiles, for more devices at once. The UK government wants the majority of the country to be covered by 5G by 2027.\n\nLike 4G, 3G and 2G before it, 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves\u2014a small part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum (which includes microwaves, visible light and X-rays). Radio waves in general cover a specific range of this spectrum.\n\nThe concerns about the health implications of 5G seem to stem from the fact that it can operate at a slightly higher frequency of this spectrum than the mobile technology that proceeded it, although it\u2019s still much closer to the previous technology than it is to potentially harmful, much higher frequency rays like X-ray and gamma rays.\n\nHigher-frequency waves, like X-rays, gamma rays and UV rays, are ionising, meaning they can damage DNA in human cells\u2014which is why they are thought to cause cancer at certain doses. But lower-frequency waves, like the radio waves coming from mobiles, are non-ionising radiation, meaning they don\u2019t damage DNA inside cells. The NHS says most current research suggests \u201cit's unlikely that radio waves from mobile phones or base stations increase the risk of any health problems.\u201d\n\nIn response to a petition asking for an independent inquiry into the health and safety risks of 5G, the government said: \u201cExposure to radio waves has been carefully researched and reviewed. The overall weight of evidence does not suggest devices producing exposures within current guidelines pose a risk to public health.\u201d\n\nPublic Health England says that exposure of the general public to radio waves from existing telecoms networks are within international guideline levels and that those guidelines will continue to apply to 5G products.\n\nAn international organisation that provides scientific advice and guidance on non-ionising radiation (like the radio waves of 5G) has guidelines on safe levels of exposure. Public Health England has said that these guidelines should be adopted, and that there\u2019s no \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d that exposure below these guidelines can cause adverse health effects. These guidelines go up to 300GHz, whereas the maximum for 5G will probably only be in the tens of GHz.\n\nPublic Health England have promised to keep reviewing new evidence and are preparing a \u201ccomprehensive review when sufficient new evidence has accumulated\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
