Here are the details.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-01-25T08:00:49.447Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86200", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/25/warren-says-she-doesnt-take-pac-money-any-kind-what-does-that-mean/", "vclaim": "A reader asked what she meant, given that federal elections records show that she has taken contributions from political action committees as recently as her 2018 Senate race. The numbers are not high, but there were more than $350,000 in PAC contributions in the 2017-2018 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. There was less than $15,000* from businesses; the rest was from labor groups and ideological PACS, such as Emily\u2019s List.\n\nIn context, Warren raised nearly $35 million for the 2018 race, so the PAC money barely exceeds 1 percent of the total. Still, there was some PAC money. Over the course of her career, Warren raised more than $1.4 million from PACS, with only 8.5 percent from business PACs.\n\nBut there\u2019s less to this than meets the eye. Corporate PACs are not really where the money is. A recent report by the Bipartisan Policy Center noted that the expected influx of corporate campaign money in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010) has not materialized.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018new money\u2019 that has entered the system since that decision is largely from individuals, many of whom have business or corporate connections, but a very small share of campaign financing comes from corporate treasury funds,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf anything, unions appear to have taken greater advantage of Citizens United, as they have spent more of their treasury money in this fashion.\u201d\n\nIn other words, corporate PACs are not much of a player \u2014 and they tend to not be especially ideological, supporting mainly incumbents from both parties. The money really comes from people who work at those companies \u2014 who may often contribute the maximum amount possible.\n\nAs we noted, Warren took very little money from business PACs, instead gathering funds mostly from labor and ideological PACs. A Warren campaign aide said she stopped taking contributions from all such PACs after she gave a speech on Aug. 21, 2018, at the National Press Club to announce a bill aimed at reducing the impact of money on politics.\n\n\u201cYou need to distinguish between normal PACs and super PACs,\u201d said Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford University law professor who was a co-author of the BPC report. \u201cNormal PACs still give some money to candidates, but it is in discrete amounts. They get drowned out by super PACs, which can receive unlimited sums from virtually any domestic source, but which cannot coordinate with a candidate. The more interesting question will be whether Warren actively prevents a super PAC from forming that would support her.\u201d\n\nWe also asked whether she would refuse contributions from the Democratic National Committee because it receives money from corporate PACs. The answer was yes. We also inquired about Emily\u2019s List, since its PAC receives money from labor PACs. The answer: She would return money from the Emily\u2019s List PAC.\n\nBut as we noted, individual contributions often amount to far more than PAC contributions. Emily\u2019s List contributed $5,000 to Warren via its PAC in 2017. But she also received $123,200 from individuals via the group from 2013 to 2018, according to CRP.\n\nWe could quibble with the phrasing of Warren\u2019s line, in that a listener might think she has never taken PAC money. But she puts it in the present tense, and that\u2019s been the case since her August speech. In any case, giving up corporate \u2014 or even non-corporate \u2014 PAC money was not an especially hard lift since such funds represent only a small portion of the funds she raised for her Senate races. There is nothing to stop individuals at companies or labor unions from contributing the maximum amount possible to her.", "lang": "en"}
