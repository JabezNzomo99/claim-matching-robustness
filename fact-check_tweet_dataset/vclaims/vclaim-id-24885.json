Past recipients of the medal include U.S. presidents, Nobel laureates, Supreme Court justices and civil rights activists.\n\nTrump was among the first 80 honorees to receive the award in 1986, along with Rosa Parks, the iconic civil rights activist, and Muhammad Ali, the professional boxer. However, the award is rarely given for specific achievements.\n\nThe Daily Caller confirmed this via email with Otto Coca, the communications director of EIHS, who said, \u201cLike many of our medalists, it\u2019s not what they did, but what they symbolize.\u201d\n\n\u201cRosa Parks received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for her personification of the American spirit when faced with injustice,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe centerpiece of her distinction is that she faced discrimination and fought it in a uniquely American way.\u201d\n\nAli earned his award for \u201chis personification of integrity and exercise of literal strength while combating discrimination,\u201d according to Coca.\n\nHe also cited Trump\u2019s success as a real estate developer in New York City and his German heritage \u2013 not contributions to the black community \u2013 as the basis for his award during in a phone interview with the Caller.", "lang": "en"}
