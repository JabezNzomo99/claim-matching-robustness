However, the posts combine various conspiracy theorists previously debunked by AFP Fact Check and experts reject any link between 5G technology and microchips.\n\n\u201cWith a 5G phone!you don't need to move around with your Phone, You just keep it at home. But a MicroChip will be implanted under your skin! (sic)\u201d reads a Facebook post shared more than 6,000 times since it was published on May 19, 2020.\n\nIt claims that \u201cpeople like Bill Gates\u201d plan to secretly inject microchips during vaccination, allowing 5G mobile phone owners to make calls, transfer money and travel internationally without passports. It warns the microchips can \u201cread your mind\u201d and could be used to control people.\n\n\u201cTomorrow a leader would rise up and say nobody should buy and sale until you have that MicroChip (666) clearly that's what the Bible warned us, 2000 years ago (sic),\u201d the text reads.\n\nAFP Fact Check found the text in various Facebook posts shared more than 12,000 times in total since April. We\u2019ve archived some of them here and here.\n\nContacted by AFP Fact Check, Mischa Dohler, Chair Professor of Wireless Communications at King\u2019s College London, said that a microchip under the skin could not be used to operate a 5G mobile phone.\n\n\u201cMicrochips and 5G have nothing in common. It\u2019s like comparing apples and a car,\u201d he told AFP Fact Check in a phone interview. \u201cMicrochips do exist and they\u2019re currently used in Nordic countries, for instance, where you can have a chip implemented (under the skin) and go and pay with that chip in a bar.\u201d\n\nHuman microchip firms have sprung up from Sweden and Denmark to the US in recent years, offering chips that are injected into the hand between the thumb and index finger to subsequently unlock doors and buy snacks with the wave of a hand. Other firms are developing chips to store medical data.\n\nDohler dismissed claims that microchips implanted in the human arm could allow smartphone users to make and receive calls without having their phone in hand.\n\n\u201cI'm not saying this will never be possible but, currently, this is scientific rubbish,\u201d he said. \u201cTo communicate, you need to generate soundwaves, so you'd need to have that microchip very close to your ear or implanted very close to the brain.\u201d\n\nMicrochips work with RFID (radio frequency identification), which allows products to be scanned for information, similar to barcodes at the supermarket.\n\nLuyun Jiang, technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market research company, said that this type of technology can only deal with \u201cvery limited data\u201d and cannot be used to make and receive phone calls.\n\n\u201c5G needs quite a lot of power and hardware,\u201d she told AFP Fact Check by phone. \u201cA microchip under the skin just like that is not going to do anything. You\u2019d need to implant a whole smartphone under your skin!\u201d\n\nThe Facebook posts also claim that COVID-19 is a \u201cman made disease\u201d introduced in 2012.\n\n\u201cOver 50% of this evil people who created this CORONA VIRUS lived in America, but God brought in Donald Trump to retard their plans greatly that was why they had to move to China an ungodly nation to launch it (sic),\u201d the posts read.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked claims that the COVID-19 outbreak was man-made or even deliberately created. Speaking to us in May, scientists explained that it would be too complicated to create a virus.\n\n\u201cEven if the most brilliant scientist wanted to create a virus, it would be infinitely too complex because you\u2019d have to create something entirely new,\u201d said Etienne Simon-Lori\u00e8re, virologist at the Institut Pasteur in Paris.\n\nHowever, the current coronavirus contains a similar genetic data to a bat coronavirus previously found in China, said Marie-Paule Kieny, head of research at France\u2019s Inserm public health research organisation.\n\nThere is currently no vaccine for COVID-19. More than 100 candidate vaccines are in development around the world, with 10 being tested on humans.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously reported on various conspiracy theories around the pandemic, including rumours that 5G technology caused the outbreak or that billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates plans to use vaccination to reduce the global population.", "lang": "en"}
