No, that's not true: It is a hoax that has circulated on social media for several years in several versions. One story claims the explosion happened at the gym, while others say it was during rough sex or when the woman sat down on a hot sidewalk.\n\nA version going viral again in October 2019 is a video published on YouTube on November 2, 2016 titled \"Woman's Butt Implants Explode While Working Out At Gym\" (archived here). The description read:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nWoman's Butt Implants Explode While Working Out At Gym A Boston Woman Went To The Doctor's Wanting A 64-inch Back Side, And Got More Than She Bargained For. Serena Beuford, 27, Of Boston, Massachusetts Was Working Out At A Gym Doing Squats For A Instagram Video For Planet Fitness, When Her \"Butt Implants\" Exploded. Gym Members Helped Her While The Medical Personnel Arrived. There Was Blood And Fluid All Over The Floor. She Was In Serious Condition, But Survived. Her Friends Said She Got What She Had Coming Because She Was The Type That Wanted Attention.\n\nWe found a virtual explosion of butt implant hoaxes starting around 2011, with reports such as:\n\nVariations included \"Butt Implants Explode In Man's Hands!\" -- trending in 2013, and this from 2014 titled \"Fake Butt Implants explode when pigeon person sat down on hot street pavement:\"\n\nThe tweets usually included links to questionable websites.\n\nThis 2016 hoax video copied the details of a purported Boston gym blast from a 2015 article and it used a photo of the purported sidewalk explosion in the 2014 tweet. The 2015 hoax fooled several \"mainstream\" publishers, including the fashion and lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan, which published an article titled \"Woman in Coma After Her Butt Implants Explode During Squat Routine.\" When Cosmo editors realized they had goofed, they added this correction:\n\nUpdate 7/15, 12:45 p.m.: It turns out this story was entirely made up, and it's virtually impossible to have anything like this happen. According to Douglas Steinbrech, a board certified plastic surgeon, \"Implants don't pop. They stay in position. It's not like a balloon. If she had a balloon filled with some kind of saline, even if it popped, the fluid still stays there and then it takes hours for the fluid to resorb. It's not like you'd have that immediate deflation.\" And even if an untrained, uncertified back-alley \"surgeon\" did manage to put a balloon into someone's body, it would have to somehow break the skin to deflate dramatically. In fact, once implants are in and healed up, Dr. Steinbrech says you'll have full range of movement and even rigorous exercise shouldn't impact the implant.\n\nWe wrote about youtube.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: There is NO Secret Color Code On Toothpaste Tubes\n\u2022 Fake News: Joe Biden Did NOT Call Trump Supporters the 'Dregs Of Society'\n\u2022 Fake News: 570 Children Taken From Their Parents And Placed Into Foster Care In Los Angeles Were NOT Murdered In 2013\n\u2022 Fake News: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Did NOT Say Images Of 9/11 Incite Violence Against Women Of Color\n\u2022 Fake News: Beto O'Rourke Did NOT Say: Yes, Democrats Are Coming For Your Hand Guns", "lang": "en"}
