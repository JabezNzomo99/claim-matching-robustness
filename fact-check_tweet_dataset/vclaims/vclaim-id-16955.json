On Sept. 22, 2015, he tweeted, \u201cJust remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!\u201d He made the claim most recently during a May 4 interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer.\n\nTrump, May 4: Do you know who started the \u201cbirther\u201d movement? Do you know who started it? Do you know who questioned his birth certificate? One of the firsts? Hillary Clinton. She\u2019s the one that started it. She brought it up years before it was brought up by me.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s campaign has never provided any evidence that claims that Obama was not born in the U.S. originated with Clinton or her campaign.\n\nIn 2011, Politico did publish an article on the origins of \u201cbirtherism\u201d that said that it began with Democrats, not Republicans.\n\nPhilip Berg, a former deputy Pennsylvania attorney general and a self-described \u201cmoderate to liberal\u201d who supported Clinton, was among the first to file a lawsuit over Obama\u2019s birth certificate. Berg\u2019s suit was dismissed on grounds that he had no legal standing to file it.\n\nBut one of the authors of the Politico story, Byron Tau, now a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, told FactCheck.org via email that \u201cwe never found any links between the Clinton campaign and the rumors in 2008.\u201d\n\nThe other coauthor of the Politico story, Ben Smith, now the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed, previously told MSNBC during a 2013 interview that the conspiracy theories traced back to \u201csome of [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] passionate supporters.\u201d But he said the theories did not come from \u201cClinton herself or her staff.\u201d\n\nOn March 19, 2007, then Clinton adviser Mark Penn wrote a strategy memo to Clinton that identified Obama\u2019s \u201clack of American roots\u201d as something that \u201ccould hold him back.\u201d That memo, which was part of campaign documents featured in a September 2008 article in The Atlantic, cited Obama\u2019s \u201cboyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii\u201d as life experiences that made his \u201cbasic American values \u2026 at best limited.\u201d But Penn\u2019s memo did not question Obama\u2019s birthplace or his birth certificate. It advised Clinton to contrast her life experiences in middle America \u201cwithout turning negative.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are never going to say anything about his background,\u201d Penn wrote.\n\nIf Trump has evidence that proves otherwise, it is long past time for him to produce it.", "lang": "en"}
