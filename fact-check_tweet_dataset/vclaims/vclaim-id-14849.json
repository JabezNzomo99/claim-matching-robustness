No, that's not true: several social media posts are spreading old news from 2016 as if it happened right after the fire that devastaded the church on April 15, 2016.\n\nAn example of such a post (archived here) can be seen below, from the Facebook page British Independence News where it was published on April 15, 2019:\n\nThe Telegraph story it linked to was from 2016:\n\nGas tanks and Arabic documents found in unmarked car by Paris' Notre-Dame cathedral spark terror fears The first couple, a man aged 34 and a woman aged 29, were arrested on a motorway lay-by near Orange, southern France. The pair were being questioned by French domestic intelligence agents who can hold them for 96 hours without charges under French anti-terror laws.\n\nThat story has since been updated with a warning:\n\nOne of the women involved in that plot was recently convicted to eight years in prison:\n\nSeveral people were sharing the old story as if it was breaking news:\n\nCurrently the cause of the fire is still under investigation, no definitive conclusions have been announced by investigators yet. All reports calling it accidental, arson, terrorism... (or anything else) are just speculation at this point.", "lang": "en"}
