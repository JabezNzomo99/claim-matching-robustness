Mark Pryor, one of the endangered Red State Democrats seeking reelection, made waves over the summer when he took the unusual step of running an ad defending the Affordable Care Act\u2014but without mentioning the law by name. (\u201cThat\u2019s why I helped pass a law that prevents insurance companies from canceling your policy if you get sick, or deny coverage for preexisting conditions,\u201d he said in the ad.)\n\nRegular readers know that The Fact Checker and other fact checking organization have long criticized the use of the $700-billion figure. That number comes from the difference over 10 years (2013-2022) between anticipated Medicare spending (what is known as \u201cthe baseline\u201d) and the changes that the law makes to reduce spending. The savings mostly are wrung from health-care providers, not Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 who, as a result of the health-care law, ended up with new benefits for preventive care and prescription drugs.\n\nThe ad flashes a headline saying Arkansas seniors faced a $1,295 cut in benefits, which it attributes to a study by the right-leaning American Action Forum, which has long been critical of the law. But this study focuses on alleged cuts in benefits for Medicare Advantage, a private-plan alternative to traditional Medicare used by about 27 percent of beneficiaries. In other words, not all seniors would face benefit cuts \u2014 and many others would gain benefits.\n\nAs we have noted before, the law sought to restrain the growth in Medicare Advantage, to the tune of $145 billion over 10 years, as it costs the U.S. government more per senior than fee-for-service Medicare. But under political pressure, the administration has also reversed some cuts that were to take place under the law.\n\nThe phrase about \u201cthreatened\u201d plans refers to the initial reports that hundreds of thousands of people in the individual market would lose the plans that did not comply with the law. However, a series of regulatory actions by the Obama administration mitigated that concern. The situation varies in different states, but Arkansas has deferred the phase-out of non-compliant plans until 2017.\n\nThe phrase \u201cthreatened\u201d appears to be a sly way to get around the fact that, in the end, relatively few plans were affected\u2014just that they were threatened to be affected. It also ignores the facts that a recent Gallup poll found that because of the law Arkansas led the nation in having the sharpest drop in the number of adults without health insurance\u2014a decline of more than 10 percentage points.\n\nAs for rising premiums, the ad cites a 2013 report by a conservative organization that sought to document the increase in premiums before and after the law. But it\u2019s very difficult to do an apples to apples comparison because the law does not allow insurance carriers to bar coverage to people with pre-existing conditions\u2014and also mandates a robust package of benefits. The impact of the changes can vary depending on your age and where you live, making it more difficult to make broad comparisons.\n\nWe can understand why Republicans might want to remind voters that Pryor is talking about the still-unpopular health-care law. But there\u2019s little excuse for being stuck in a time warp of predicted fears, in contrast to what\u2019s happening now.\n\nGenerally, we\u2019ve given Two Pinocchios to claims about the $700 billion cut in Medicare. But running an ad about higher premiums \u2014 just a week after a decline in premiums was announced \u2014 tips this into the Three Pinocchio category.", "lang": "en"}
