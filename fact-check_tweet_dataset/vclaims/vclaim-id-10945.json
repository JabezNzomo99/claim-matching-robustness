There is an official record (Hansard) of Irish spoken in the House of Commons, by Thomas O\u2019Donnell MP, on 19 February 1901. Also, Mark Durkan MP spoke Irish in the House as recently as 17 January 2017.\n\nBefore asking her question to Karen Bradley MP (Conservative), about the introduction of an Irish language Act , Welsh MP Liz Saville Roberts (Plaid Cymru) spoke a sentence in Irish language during the debate about the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Bill on 24 October 2018:\n\nRoberts provided an interpretation to the House at the time:\n\n\u201cLanguage rights are human rights and the Irish speakers of Ireland deserve fair play.\u201d\n\nRoberts tweeted that she understood that \u201cthis is the first time the Irish language has been spoken in the @HouseofCommons chamber.\u201d\n\nThe Irish Times mentioned that Irish Member of Parliament, Thomas O\u2019Donnell, gave his maiden speech in the Irish language on 19 February 1901. This rebukes Roberts\u2019 claim.\n\nDuring O\u2019Donnell\u2019s speech, the Speaker interrupted and told him that he \u201ccannot allow him to address the House in any other language but English\u201d. There did not exist any precedent concerning language in parliament, but according to the Speaker no speeches had been given in a language other than English before. He then declared it as a rule of the House. He stated you can use words and quotations in another language in the course of a speech, but not the speech itself.\n\nLater that year, on 21 May, O\u2019Donnell read out loud a letter in the Irish language in parliament.\n\nMuch more recently, former MP Mark Durkan (SDLP) spoke the Irish language on a couple occasions in the House of Commons.\n\nOn 21 July 2015, he gave Scottish parliamentarian Angus Brendan MacNeil MP (SNP) his birthday wishes in Irish:\n\n\u201c\u2026 May I say to the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil) breithl\u00e1 sona d\u00f3? Go maire s\u00e9 on l\u00e1.\u201d MacNeil on his turn thanked him, in Irish as well as Scots Gaelic (\u201cThank you very much\u201d): \u201cGo raibh m\u00edle maith agat agus m\u00f2ran taing.\u201d\n\nDurkan also wished the Speaker of parliament a Merry Christmas in Irish (video) on 17 December the same year: \u201cNollaig Shona duit, a Cheann Comhairle!\u201d\n\nOn 17 January 2017, Durkan spoke the Irish language when expressing his condolences (video) after the death of the former Foreign Affairs secretary general Dermot Gallagher (\u201cMay his soul be on the right hand of God.\u201d/\u201dGod rest his soul.\u201d): \u201cAr dheis D\u00e9 go raibh a anam.\u201d\n\nApart from the Irish language, the 1999 North/South Co-operation Order calls for the promotion of Ulster-Scots in Northern Ireland. This language too had been spoken in the House of Commons. Jim Shannon MP (DUP) spoke Ulster-Scots during his maiden speech on 8 June 2010:\n\n\u201cThaur is monies a guid thang at A cud sae aboot tha fowk o mi Baille-Wick bot yince an firmaist A coont it a muckle oaner tae spake oot oan thair ahauf in tha Hoose O Commons. Tha Strengfird fowk ir tha satt o tha grun, an in thenkin thaim fer thair support A wud promis thaim at A\u2019ll wrocht an dae fer thaim aa at A caun.\u201d\n\nShannon provided the House with an interpretation:\n\n\u201cThere are many good things that I could say about the people of my constituency, and first of all is that it is a great honour to speak on their behalf in the House of Commons. The Strangford people are the salt of the earth and in thanking them for their support, I also assure them that I shall work and do for them the best I can.\u201d\n\nWhile English is \u201cthe language of the House\u201d, other languages have been spoken in the House of Commons, whether as a few words or sentences as well as in quoting others. The Irish language has been spoken in the House of Commons since 1901, indeed within the last two years by Mark Durkan MP. Likewise, Northern Ireland MP Jim Shannon spoke Ulster-Scots in the House in 2010.\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
