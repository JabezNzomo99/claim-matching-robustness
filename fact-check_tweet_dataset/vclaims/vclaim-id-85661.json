BOOM found that the video was made by an international film production company.\n\nThe 13 second long video clip shows movement of what appears to be a mermaid on a makeshit jetty, as astounded watchers can be heard in the background.\n\nThe tweet originally composed in Hindi reads, \"A mysterious creature fish like creature has been spotted. It has a head and two hands like human beings. Don't know where it has been found, cannot get understand what is this or is it a doctored video? Please #FactCheck.\" Click here to see the tweet and here for an archived link.\n\nAfter the Government of India announced a nationwide lockdown in the country, several old and unrelated videos are viral with claims that wild animals are reclaiming the human habitats because of restricted movement. BOOM has debunked multiple of these videos. \n\n BOOM was able to ascertain that the video is a work of animation and art and no such creature has been discovered. We found a video, a compilation of three bizarre creatures, that was uploaded on September 30, 2019 by a YouTube channel JJPD Producciones. The clip featured the viral mermaid video which can be seen after the time stamp 1 minutes 42 seconds.\n\nThe same video, cropped to fit in a different aspect ratio, was earlier viral on TikTok. An audio of people watching the mythical creature was added to the same. Several users had cropped the watermark of the production house (visible on top right). BOOM has compared the original scene with the viral video.", "lang": "en"}
