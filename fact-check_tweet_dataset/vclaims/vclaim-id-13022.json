It\u2019s not enough to count laws to figure out the reasons gun deaths are lower in one state than another. One would need to specifically determine whether certain laws had an effect, over time, on the gun-death rate in a state.\n\nBut Murphy, in his statement, is extrapolating across the county\u2013and not being as careful as Obama was with his language. He also stated it as an accepted fact \u2014 \u201cwhat we know\u201d \u2014 when the evidence is not so clear-cut. So, in this instance, Murphy\u2019s claim is worthy of Three Pinocchios because he specifically referred to homicides, rather gun deaths.\n\n\u201cOur study seems to indicate that both the Federal assault rifle ban and individual State assault rifle bans do not affect the likelihood that an assault rifle was used in a mass shooting,\u201d Blau said. \u201cSaid differently, these types of bans do not appear to deter the \u2018use\u2019 of an assault rifle during a mass shooting. In the data that we used, determining whether assault rifle bans (negatively) influenced the likelihood of the occurrence of a mass shooting was not conclusive.\u201d\n\nNow, as our colleague Christopher Ingraham has pointed out, assault-style rifles have been used in seven of the eight high-profile public mass shootings since July of last year. That certainly raises the profile of the weapon, but the data so far does not show a link between the use of the weapons and the lifting of the ban, as Murphy asserts.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s our bottom line: The statistics cited and stories told on Wednesday all show that it is undeniable that guns kill thousands of Americans every year,\u201d said Murphy spokesman Chris Harris. \u201cAnd that when you step back and look at the totality of the data, easier access to firearms by way of fewer regulations leads to an increase in gun deaths \u2014 both homicides and suicides. This is true in the U.S. when comparing state-to-state, and in comparing the U.S. to other nations.\u201d\n\nMurphy says it is \u201cnot coincidental\u201d that mass shootings have increased since the ban was lifted. But the data shows that the ban was not particularly effective in the first place \u2014 and that mass shootings have not increased significantly since then. The data set is relatively small, and maybe something has changed in the past year. But for now this claim is worthy of Three Pinocchios.\n\nSemiautomatic, as defined by the 1968 Gun Control Act, means one pull of the trigger equates to one bullet leaving the barrel. Fully automatic rifles are available in the United States, but they require about six months of paperwork from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They are also significantly more expensive than their single-fire counterparts \u2014 and are banned in many states. Moreover, a 1986 law banned new ones, so any automatic weapon you purchased now would be an old one.\n\n[Correction: An astute reader points out that that this product, the Slide Fire stock, is not an auto sear. \u201cBump fire\u201d stocks such as the Slide Fire stock simulate automatic fire by allowing the shooter to automatically pull the trigger each time the gun recoils, but can also make the weapon quite inaccurate. It does not require ATF permission since the weapon is still not considered automatic. Meanwhile, an auto sear must be registered prior to May 19, 1986, and can only be transferred with permission of the ATF because once installed, the rifle is considered an automatic weapon.]", "lang": "en"}
