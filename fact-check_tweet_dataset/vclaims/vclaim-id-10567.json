Is this true? __________________________________________________________________________ Walt Disney will give $5.00 to Make a Wish Foundation for every picture posted with Mickey Mouse Ears. #ShareYourEars __________________________________________________________________________ A thing is going around Facebook saying that Disney will donate $5.00 to the Make-A-Wish Foundation for every self with Mouse ears posted on Facebook. True or False?\n\nThe donation drive is without an end date or funding limit.\n\nFrom 29 January to 14 March 2016, Disney Parks will donate $5 to Make-A-Wish, up to $1 million, for every ear photo shared online.\n\nIn February 2016, the hashtag #ShareYourEars began trending on Facebook and Twitter. The posts claimed that for every photograph of a user wearing mouse ears, Disney Parks would donate $5 to the Make-A-Wish foundation.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t difficult to verify basic portions of that claim, as both Disney Parks and the Make-A-Wish foundation promoted the drive on Facebook:\n\nLike many such efforts, however, the #ShareYourEars donation drive had strict parameters. The promotion involved both a date cap (29 January 2016 through 14 March 2016) and a financial one. After $1 million in #ShareYourEars donations were collected, the drive would end. At $5 per \u201cears selfie,\u201d that worked out to 200,000 participants eligible for participation.\n\nIt was true that #ShareYourEars photos were encouraged as social media submissions by Disney Parks in participation with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, but was constrained by both time and a limited number of participants, dictated by the million-dollar cap.", "lang": "en"}
