Politico reported that Greene, who is also a supporter of QAnon, an unfounded and wide-ranging collection of conspiracy theories centered around the idea that Trump is in the middle of a biblical war against a \u201cdeep state\u201d of satanic, baby-eating politicians, said that politicians like Omar, a Muslim, was part of \u201can Islamic invasion of our government.\u201d\n\nThe candidate, Marjorie Taylor Greene, suggested that Muslims do not belong in government; thinks black people \u201care held slaves to the Democratic Party\u201d; called George Soros, a Jewish Democratic megadonor, a Nazi; and said she would feel \u201cproud\u201d to see a Confederate monument if she were black because it symbolizes progress made since the Civil War. In recordings obtained by POLITICO, Greene described Islamic nations under Sharia law as places where men have sex with \u201clittle boys, little girls, multiple women\u201d and \u201cmarry their sisters\u201d and \u201ctheir cousins.\u201d She suggested the 2018 midterms \u2014 which ushered in the most diverse class of House freshmen \u2014 was part of \u201can Islamic invasion of our government\u201d and that \u201canyone that is a Muslim that believes in Sharia law does not belong in our government.\u201d\n\nOmar posted a message about Greene\u2019s Facebook post, calling it an incitement to violence:\n\nGreene responded, telling Omar to \u201crelax,\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cjust a meme\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
