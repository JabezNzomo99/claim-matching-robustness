(See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Badoy errs in claiming NDF tagged as a terror group by PH, other countries)\n\nMananzan has previously spoken against Duterte\u2019s leadership and his policies, including the bloody drug war and moves to reimpose the death penalty.\n\nPalace Spokesperson Harry Roque, in his June 23 press briefing, was asked about the possible dangers of red-tagging, given the president's recent remarks that communist rebels are the \u201cnumber one threat\u201d to the country. He dismissed Badoy\u2019s views on her Facebook post on Mananzan as \u201cpersonal opinions,\u201d which are within her rights to freedom of expression.\n\nShould the court rule in favor of the government and legally declare the CPP-NPA a terrorist group, persons and entities suspected to be associated with the organization may be put under surveillance, have their assets frozen, or even detained without charges. (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: Why 'red-tagging' is dangerous)\n\nResponding to Badoy\u2019s claims, GABRIELA said in a June 18 statement: \u201cBadoy is loading up the regime\u2019s guns for either arresting or harming Sister Mary John and other critics of the Duterte regime.\u201d\n\nOn her Facebook posts and interviews, Badoy drums up support for the proposed Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, which aims to \u201cstrengthen\u201d the government\u2019s campaign against terrorism, and is currently awaiting the president\u2019s signature.\n\nIf enacted, the law will expand the definition of terrorist acts, extend the amount of time one can be detained after a warrantless arrest, and extend the surveillance time for a suspect\u2019s communications.
