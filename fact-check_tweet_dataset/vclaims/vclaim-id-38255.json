(RELATED: Did Obama\u2019s Portrait Fall Off The Wall During The Unveiling Of Trump\u2019s Portrait At The Colorado Capitol?)\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that Obama ever said or wrote the exact statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. In fact, an internet search revealed that credible online sources have reported on the quote in order to debunk it.\n\nThe former president and schoolmate Robert Fisher did co-write a paper for a Harvard Law class in April 1991 that mentions Trump. An excerpt from that unpublished paper appeared in author David Garrow\u2019s 2017 book \u201cRising Star: The Making of Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the relevant excerpt from Obama and Fisher\u2019s unpublished paper, per The Hill:\n\n[Americans have] a continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility, values that extend beyond the issue of race in the American mind. The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American \u2013 I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don\u2019t make it, my children will.\n\nThe reference to Trump, Snopes noted, was not an example of the American dream but rather an example of the \u201cunfounded optimism of the average American.\u201d The paper overall argued black Americans should \u201cshift away from rights rhetoric and toward the language of opportunity,\u201d according to Snopes.", "lang": "en"}
