He added that Macron was a target due to his pro-Europe policies.\n\nThe chief editor of RT and Sputnik, Margarita Simonyan, denied the allegations, saying Russian media are not trying to influence foreign politics.\n\nThe French, however, are not the only Western officials to accuse the Kremlin's broadcasting corporation, which includes RT and Sputnik, of meddling in their political processes.\n\nA U.S. intelligence declassified report listed RT and Sputnik as main tools in the Kremlin\u2019s effort to influence public opinion in the U.S. during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAnd emails accusing German soldiers stationed in Lithuania of rape were sent last week to local news outlets, the latest incident in what NATO officials say is a Russian \"fake news\" campaign aimed at eroding public support for the military alliance, according to Voice of America.\n\nThe emails, which were sent to several Lithuanian media outlets on February 14, claimed German soldiers based in the Baltic state had raped an underage Lithuanian girl.\n\nSome Lithuanian outlets reported the claim, which was dismissed by Lithuanian police, who are trying to track the internet protocol address involved in the distribution of the allegation.\n\nThe misinformation incident bears similarity to the so-called Lisa case last year in which Russian media outlets first reported and then fomented a media storm in Germany about a claim made by 13-year-old Russian-German girl who said she'd been abducted and raped by Arab migrants in Berlin.\n\nIt transpired that the girl had made up the story, hoping to disguise from her parents that she'd spent the night at a boyfriend's home. The Lisa case affected already strained relations between Berlin and Moscow.\n\nSenior NATO general Petr Pavel, who heads NATO's military committee, warned Europe on February 18 to expect more \"fake news\" from the Russians.\n\nOn February 2, UK Defense Minister Michael Fallon called upon Western nations to \u201cdo more to tackle the false reality,\u201d which the Russian government media are creating.\n\n\u201cWe see a country that, in weaponizing misinformation, has created what we might see now as the post-truth age,\u201d Fallon said.\n\nThe European Union's governing body, the European Council, created a strategy in 2016 aimed at countering Russian propaganda.\n\nThe action plan calls for the 28-nation EU to more actively promote freedom of the media by boosting support for independent media in \u201ceastern neighborhood\u201d countries and increasing awareness of \u201cdisinformation activities by external actors.\u201d\n\nRussian journalist Alexey Kovalev, a former senior editor at Russia's largest state news agency RIA Novosti and the founder and editor of noodleremover.news - a Russian-language fact-checking website - told Polygraph.info that Peskov\u2019s statement about Russian media is false.\n\n\u201cIt is not about fake or true,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a hypocrisy.\n\n\"I mean, RT is doing exactly that,\" he said about Russian media influencing public opinion abroad.\n\nCreated in 2005, the Kremlin's international broadcasting agency RT has expanded its coverage to include five more languages - in addition to Russian and English - and opened bureaus in 22 countries around the world.\n\nThe agency's annual budget has increased from $30 million in 2005 to $320 million in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
