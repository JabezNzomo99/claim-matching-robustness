Of course not, despite claims by a viral video posted recently by The Free Though Project no such thing will happen, the claim is not true.\n\nThe Facebook post was published on April 1, 2018 (archived here) and had following caption under the video:\n\nThe text in the video read:\n\nSeveral planets will align causing the Earth's Moon to appear green for 90 minutes. This phenomenon is known as \"green moon\" and only happens once every four hundred & twenty years.\n\nIf you were wondering what the creators of the video were smoking, you'd be right. Snopes already debunked versions of this hoax in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe references to the number 420 in the text (4/20, four hundred & twenty) are clearly meant as a nod to marijuana culture. However it appears the hoax came a little earlier this year so it could double as an April Fools' Day joke as well.", "lang": "en"}
