Like and Share if you grew up watching me on television, have a gun, and haven\u2019t shot or killed anyone!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThere is no documented evidence, or any past or present media reports that say Yosemite has ever been banned or cut from the show for any reason.\n\nThe only Looney Tunes character to be temporarily banned was Speedy Gonzales, a small Mexican mouse who was deemed an offensive stereotype and reportedly pulled off the air in late 1999. But fans of Speedy rallied to get the character back on TV. Animated shorts featuring the mouse returned in 2002.\n\nTen episodes of \"Merrie Melodies\" (a Looney Tunes sister series also produced by Warner Bros.) and one Looney Tunes segment called \"Angel Puss,\" were all pulled from syndication in the 1960s over racist content. Angel Puss, which was released in 1944, depicted a young boy in blackface. These cartoons are sometimes referred to as the \"Censored Eleven\" and none include Yosemite Sam.\n\nMeanwhile, you can still see Looney Tunes reruns on television today. On Boomerang, a cable television network and streaming service owned by Warner Bros., you can stream the show and catch the show\u2019s characters, including Yosemite, at 10 a.m. on weekdays.\n\nA social media post claims that Looney Tunes character Yosemite Sam was banned from television for \"being too violent.\"\n\nThere is no evidence that Yosemite\u2019s segments were ever banned. We can still find the red-bearded cowboy on television today.", "lang": "en"}
