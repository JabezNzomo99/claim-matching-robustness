Intelligence agencies were struggling to understand why Russia reversed course on its pledge to respond. (Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov originally had announced that 35 U.S. diplomats would be declared persona non grata, with his statement echoed by tweets from the Russian Embassy in Washington.) The communication intercepts showed that Flynn had asked the Russians not to retaliate, indicating that the incoming administration\u2019s policy would take a different approach. That raised red flags, as usually an incoming president does not try to undermine foreign policy actions taken by the existing president.\n\nIn an FBI interview, Mary McCord, then a top official in the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, said she learned on Jan. 3 about the FBI investigation into the calls. She said that then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe reported that a DNI official suggested the conversation could be a violation of the Logan Act. \u201cMcCord was not familiar with the Logan Act at the time and made a note to herself to look it up later,\u201d the FBI interview notes said. (The Logan Act is an obscure law, signed by President John Adams in 1799, which seeks to prevent private citizens from intervening, without authorization, in disputes between the United States and foreign governments. It has never been successfully prosecuted.)\n\nWhat was said at the meeting?\n\n[Update, Aug. 5: Yates, in testimony before the Senate, said under oath that neither Obama nor Biden attempted to influence the FBI\u2019s investigation of Flynn during the meeting. \u201cDuring the meeting, the president, the vice president, the national security adviser did not attempt to any way to direct or influence any investigation,\u201d she said. She said Obama\u2019s only interest in Flynn was to ensure that it was safe to share sensitive national security information with the incoming administration while the FBI investigated him.]\n\n\u201cDirector Comey affirmed that he is proceeding \u2018by the book\u2019 as it relates to law enforcement. From a national security perspective, Comey said he does have some concerns that incoming NSA Flynn is speaking frequently with Russian Ambassador Kislyak. Comey said that could be an issue as it relates to sharing sensitive information. President Obama asked if Comey was saying that the NSC should not pass sensitive information related to Russia to Flynn. Comey replied \u2018potentially.\u2019 He added that he has no indication thus far that Flynn has passed classified information to Kislyak, but he noted that \u2018the level of communication is unusual.\u2019 The President asked Comey to inform him if anything changes in the next few weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming team. Comey said that he would.\u201d\n\nVP: I have been on the intel committee for ten years and I never. P: Make sure you look at things - have the right people on it. P: Is there anything I shouldn\u2019t be telling transition team?\n\n\u201cPete\u2019s notes are being cynically taken out of context in order to weaponize them to try to help Trump\u2019s reelection bid,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cLet me be clear: Pete\u2019s notes do not reflect any attempt to interfere in the investigation of General Flynn by President Obama, Vice President Biden, or anyone else in the Obama Administration. The FBI\u2019s investigation of General Flynn was properly predicated on the Russian government\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts. It is interesting that, after attacking Pete\u2019s credibility for years, the President\u2019s allies are again trying to use his notes, this time to undermine Vice President Biden.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither Vice President Biden nor anyone else in the White House ever advocated for a criminal investigation of Michael Flynn for violating the Logan Act,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told The Fact Checker. \u201cThese are third-hand notes and the very person who wrote them \u2014 who was not part of the White House meeting \u2014 says they \u2018do not reflect any attempt to interfere in the investigation of General Flynn.\u2019 These notes are also consistent with what has long been in the public record, and change nothing. Flynn\u2019s interactions with a Russian diplomat and spy appropriately raised counterintelligence concerns that were shared across the two administrations.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
