Rather, Biden was advocating a stakeholder-driven approach to capitalism and calling for an end to the predominance of the shareholder-driven approach, a position that has grown in popularity in recent years, even among the CEOs of the largest companies in the United States.\n\nIn a speech on July 9, Biden proposed to \"put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism \u2014 the idea [that] the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2020, multiple readers asked Snopes to investigate claims that former U.S. Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden had called for an end to \u201cshareholder capitalism.\u201d\n\nIn July and August, Facebook users shared posts that contained the following text:\n\n\u201cBiden wants to end Shareholder Capitalism\u2026that\u2019s your 401[k]\u2026your pensions\u2026your retirement\u2026are you voting for that?\u201d\n\nAnother social media meme suggested that Biden\u2019s proposals would result in the destruction or liquidation of 401(k) pension savings:\n\nThose memes did not accurately reflect remarks made by Biden in July 2020 on the subject of \u201cshareholder capitalism.\u201d\n\nAt a July 9 event in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, Biden gave a relatively conventional stump speech, hitting on several familiar themes \u2014 his working-class upbringing in nearby Scranton, the values he inherited from his family, and his vision for an American economy that, according to him, places less emphasis on corporate profit, and a greater emphasis on rewarding hard work and smaller-scale entrepreneurship, especially in the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, which devastated some smaller businesses and left millions unemployed.\n\nAs part of this broader \u201cWall Street versus Main Street\u201d theme, Biden said the following (emphasis added):\n\nEnough is enough, it\u2019s time reverse the priorities in this country. It\u2019s time to help small businesses, middle-class folks, manage their way through a pandemic, and let\u2019s help millions of would-be entrepreneurs get out from under their debts so they can start businesses. And it\u2019s time corporate America paid their fair share of taxes\u2026The days of Amazon paying nothing in federal income tax will be over. Let\u2019s make sure that workers have a power, and the voice. It\u2019s way past time to put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism \u2014 the idea [that] the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders. That\u2019s simply not true, it\u2019s an absolute farce. They have responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country. That isn\u2019t [a] new or radical notion. These are basic values and principles that helped build this nation in the first instance. Now the challenge is to take these fundamental values, and apply them to the new economy we have to build in the years ahead\u2026\u201d\n\nBiden did not propose dissolving the stock market, or prohibiting the public trading of companies, or shareholder investment and dividend. In saying \u201cIt\u2019s way past time to put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism,\u201d Biden was taking a position in a long-running ethical debate between \u201cshareholder\u201d and \u201cstakeholder\u201d theories.\n\nOne academic has helpfully summed up that philosophical conflict as follows:\n\nShareholder theory asserts that shareholders advance capital to a company\u2019s managers, who are supposed to spend corporate funds only in ways that have been authorized by the shareholders. As Milton Friedman wrote, \u201cThere is one and only one social responsibility of business \u2014 to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it \u2026 engages in open and free competition, without deception or fraud.\u201d On the other hand, stakeholder theory asserts that managers have a duty to both the corporation\u2019s shareholders and \u201cindividuals and constituencies that contribute, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to [a company\u2019s] wealth-creating capacity and activities, and who are therefore its potential beneficiaries and/or risk bearers.\u201d Although there is some debate regarding which stakeholders deserve consideration, a widely accepted interpretation refers to shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and the local community.\n\nIn the short video below, philosopher and professor of business administration R. Edward Freeman \u2014 arguably the primary advocate for stakeholder theory \u2014 outlines the approach:\n\nBiden characterized the era of shareholder capitalism as one in which the following idea holds sway \u2014 \u201c[that] the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders.\u201d His rejection of that principle was classic stakeholder theory: \u201cThat\u2019s simply not true, it\u2019s an absolute farce. They [companies] have responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country.\u201d\n\nWe asked the Biden campaign for details on any specific proposals the former vice president had, or how exactly he envisioned an end to \u201cthe era of shareholder capitalism,\u201d but we did not receive a response in time for publication.\n\nAlthough those details were not available, it\u2019s clear that Biden was not calling for the abolition of shareholding itself. Rather, he proposed bringing an end to the era of shareholder capitalism, meaning an end to the predominance of that particular ethical approach and a new gravitation towards the stakeholder-driven approach, a position that, whether or not one agrees with its tenets, has in recent years become orthodox among progressives, within the Democratic party, and even among business leaders themselves.\n\nIn 2019, for example, the Business Roundtable \u2014 an influential group of chief executive officers of some of the largest companies in the United States \u2014 executed a high-profile shift in its approach, writing:\n\n\u201cSince 1978, Business Roundtable has periodically issued Principles of Corporate Governance that include language on the purpose of a corporation. Each version of that document issued since 1997 has stated that corporations exist principally to serve their shareholders. It has become clear that this language on corporate purpose does not accurately describe the ways in which we and our fellow CEOs endeavor every day to create value for all our stakeholders, whose long-term interests are inseparable.\u201d\n\nWhat Biden called for in his Dunmore speech was therefore, as he rightly said, not a \u201cnew or radical notion.\u201d It was not an end to the stock market nor the ability of individuals to buy and sell shares, and therefore it was not a proposal that would cause pensions to evaporate, as several Facebook memes falsely claimed.", "lang": "en"}
