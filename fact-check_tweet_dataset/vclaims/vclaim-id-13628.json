This is because \u201can outbreak of human papillomavirus\u201d that \u201ckills faster than HIV/Aids\u201d is being spread through kissing in Kenya.\n\nThe story goes that several people have already been admitted to hospital in Kenya\u2019s western county of\n\n\u201cafter testing positive to the disease\u201d. And the \u201cdisease\u201d will soon fan out to the rest of Africa and the world, the article says.\n\n\u201cWe are being advised even on Whatsapp groups to avoid kissing and exchanging body fluids,\u201d an unnamed student from\n\nis quoted as saying.\n\nTwo pictures in the article supposedly show human papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the lips, tongue and tonsils.\n\nIs a fast-killing strain of HPV being spread by careless kissing? We checked.\n\n\u201cNo such outbreak has ever been reported,\u201d Sarah Omache, the Kisii county executive committee member responsible for health, told Africa Check.\n\nFaith Obike, a spokesperson for Kisii Level 5 Hospital, to which patients were allegedly admitted, said their records didn\u2019t show admissions for a HPV \u201coutbreak\u201d.\n\nWhat of the images?\n\nof the first photo showing infection of the tongue and tonsils revealed it was from the\n\nBut on Wikimedia it is identified as showing infectious mononucleosis, or glandular fever. While HPV is\n\nthrough body fluids, especially saliva, the virus is\n\n\u201cYes, the photo of the tonsils is of mononucleosis and I took it,\u201d Heilman told Africa Check.\n\nThe second image showing sores on lips was traced to\n\ndescribed as \u201clips affected by herpes virus\u201d, which Heilman confirmed. \u201cWhy would someone use it on a page on HPV?\u201d he asked.\n\n, told Africa Check. Rather, they are\n\n\u201cThere are more than 100 types of human papillomavirus. Most human beings carry the papillomavirus with no harmful effects,\u201d Mugo said.\n\nand go away without treatment. But about 15 strains pose a high risk of disease, Mugo said.\n\nare known to cause the majority of cervical cancer cases.\n\nHPV can infect the mouth during oral sex.\n\n\"The same high-risk HPV strain that causes cervical cancer also causes throat and anal cancer,\u201d Dr\n\nKalebi said he had not seen any data confirming an \u201coutbreak\u201d of throat cancer in Kenya. \u201cBut I do know that we have increased number of cases of throat cancer in recent years and possibly this could be related to high risk HPV because of increased oral sex.\u201d\n\nCan kissing cause infection with HPV\n\nHPV is almost never transmitted by kissing, said Dr Peter Gichangi, who\n\nhuman anatomy and reproductive health at the\n\n\u201cNormal kisses will not lead to infection with HPV. However, if a person infected with oral HPV engages in \u2018French\u2019 kissing with an uninfected person, the infection may happen although this is very rare.\u201d\n\nMost HPV infections can be treated, Mugo said, adding that there are also vaccines against the types that increase the risk of cervical cancer.\n\nBecause it can take more than 10 years from when a person is infected to when a cancer is detected, during which time an infection with the virus can be treated, it is inaccurate to say HPV can kill faster than HIV, Mugo said.\n\nGichangi agreed. He said it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to be admitted to hospital with \u201cHPV symptoms\u201d. It\n\nfor the cancers - oral and others - caused by the virus to develop.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore false that HPV kills faster than HIV,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
