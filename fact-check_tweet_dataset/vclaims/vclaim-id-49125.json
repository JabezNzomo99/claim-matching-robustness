The accompanying graphic says:\n\nThe text accompanying the post goes on to say:\n\n\u201cA report published by the UK Government titled \u2018Landscapes Review\u2019, has two aims, one of which is to get more ethnic minorities into the English countryside. The 168-page independent report was commissioned by Michael Gove. To summarise, the two outcomes of the report are: 2. To increase the number of ethnic minority visitors.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that a government report into National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) in England was commissioned when Michael Gove was Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nThe 2019 report was not just about the \u201cEnglish countryside\u201d as the post claims, but specifically national parks, such as the Lake District, and AONBs, such as the North Pennines. The review was into whether the protections for such locations are \u201cstill fit for purpose\u201d and \u201cwhat might be done better, what changes will help and whether the definitions and systems in place are still valid.\u201d\n\nAnd although the report mentions ethnic minorities several times, by no means does it say any area is \u201ctoo white\u201d.\n\nWithin its main summary, the report says that a small minority of those on the boards of national parks and AONBs are black, Asian or minority ethnicities. It also proposes that \u201cNew long term programmes to increase the ethnic diversity of visitors\u201d are needed, one of 27 proposals that the report sets out.\n\nThe main report also talks about how \u201cblack, Asian, and minority ethnic groups\u201d are among the groups that tend to visit the countryside less, and perceive the countryside as a \u201cwhite environment\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
