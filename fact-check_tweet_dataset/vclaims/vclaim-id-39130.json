Other Democratic politicians, including the party\u2019s frontrunner for presidential nominee Joe Biden, have made the same assertion. Michael Bloomberg accused Trump of \u201cslash[ing] funding of the CDC and other essential health agencies,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff tweeted that \u201cThe Trump Administration has slashed CDC funding,\u201d and Sen. Brian Schatz claimed \u201cTrump cut CDC by 9 percent.\u201d\n\nHowever, while Trump has attempted to cut funding to the CDC, overall funding to the agency has increased under the Trump administration.\n\nSince assuming office in 2017, Trump has sent four budget proposals to Congress. Each one requested a decrease in funding for the CDC\u2014you can view the budget numbers here: 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021. Congress has not yet passed a budget for this year, but Trump has signed a budget that increased funding for the CDC every year he\u2019s been in office.\n\nLast week, Congress reached a bipartisan deal giving an additional $8.3 billion to the CDC in emergency funding to combat the coronavirus, $5.5 billion more than the Trump administration had initially requested. The bill was signed into law by the president on Friday.\n\nClinton is, however, correct in saying that under Trump the CDC \u201ccut back on this program of overseas vigilance.\u201d The CDC decided to end epidemic prevention activities in 39 out of the 49 foreign countries it was active in due to a predicted absence of funding for the programs, even as funding for other CDC activities increased.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
