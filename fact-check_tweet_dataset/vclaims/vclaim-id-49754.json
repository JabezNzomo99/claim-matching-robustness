The claim is false; the US federal government has distributed US$7.3 billion in loans during the pandemic to a wide variety of religious organisations, not just evangelical churches, according to official data.\n\nThe claim was posted here on a New Zealand-based Facebook page. The post has been shared more than 160 times.\n\nThe post features an image of a crowd at a stadium. The text below reads in part: \u201cI got $1,200. You got $1,200 (maybe). Evangelical churches got $7.3 billion.\u201d\n\nSince April 2020, a range of small businesses, independent contractors and non-profit organisations (including religious organisations) in the US have been eligible for loans capped at US$10 million.\n\nThe $1,200 figure included in the false Facebook posts is a reference to the Economic Impact Payments given to eligible Americans by the federal government in response to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe text featured in the image was also shared on Facebook here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nThe US Small Business Administration (SBA), the federal agency that distributes COVID-19 loans through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), reported here that as of June 30, 2020, US$7.3 billion in loans were given to \u201creligious organisations\u201d.\n\nThis data set accompanying the SBA report shows that a wide variety of religious organisations received loans under the scheme, not just evangelical churches as the false posts claim.\n\nOther faith-based recipients included the Islamic Association of North Texas and the Saint Elizabeth Roman Catholic Parish in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe PPP was established under the US Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act in order to help businesses keep workers employed after COVID-19 sparked a wave of unemployment in the country.", "lang": "en"}
