There\u2019s a difference.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-1601", "url": "https://fullfact.org/crime/hate-incidents-arent-same-hate-crimes/", "vclaim": "Hate incidents aren\u2019t the same as hate crimes\n\nReports that a speech on immigration by Home Secretary Amber Rudd has been treated by police as a \u2018hate incident\u2019 have turned heads today.\n\nIn the speech, which sharply divided opinion, Ms Rudd set out proposals to tighten the tests companies have to take before recruiting workers from overseas.\n\nReaders of our coverage on measuring crime will be no strangers to the difference between \u2018incidents\u2019 and \u2018crimes\u2019, and it\u2019s worth spelling out the distinction in the light of this case.\n\nNot all \u2018incidents\u2019 are \u2018crimes\u2019\n\nImagine that a man on a ladder is breaking into a house and someone reports it to the police. The person who reports it says they\u2019ve seen a burglar. But when the police turn up, it turns out he\u2019s the owner and he forgot his keys. An incident has occurred, but a crime hasn\u2019t.\n\nAs West Midlands Police has confirmed, it doesn\u2019t consider Amber Rudd\u2019s speech a hate crime. It\u2019s been logged as a \u2018non-crime hate incident\u2019, and isn\u2019t being taken further by the force.\n\nThat terminology might make it sound like the police agree the content of the speech was hateful, but that isn\u2019t true.\n\nAccording to the police\u2019s own rules that they get from the Home Office: \u201call reports of incidents, whether from victims, witnesses or third parties and whether crime related or not, will, unless immediately recorded as a crime, result in the registration of an auditable incident report by the police.\u201d\n\nIn other words, someone reported Ms Rudd\u2019s speech to the police, claiming it was using hate speech. The police were obliged to record that as an incident, whether or not they eventually \u2018upgrade\u2019 it to a crime.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, crimes are recorded as \u2018hate crimes\u2019 if the victim, or the person reporting it, thinks that it was at least partly motivated by the victim\u2019s perceived race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or because they were transgender.\n\nThe same rules from the police state that for incidents to be \u2018upgraded\u2019 to be called crimes, the \u201cbalance of probability\u201d must show that:\n\u2022 The circumstances of the victim\u2019s report amount to a crime defined by law (the police will determine this, based on their knowledge of the law and counting rules); and\n\u2022 There is no credible evidence to the contrary immediately available.\n\nThis test can differ for certain kinds of crime, such as those against the state, and it goes on to say that the victim believing that a crime has occurred is usually sufficient to justify recording it as such.\n\nCrimes don\u2019t necessarily remain crimes. If more information comes to light and the police decide that the test is no longer being met, the cases are \u2018no-crimed\u2019.\n\nIf you want to put yourself in the police\u2019s shoes, here\u2019s how HM Inspectorate of Constabulary summarises the process:", "lang": "en"}
