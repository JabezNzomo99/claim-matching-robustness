BJP workers were manhandled in West Bengal when they passed Rohingya and Bangladeshi settlements.),\u201d is the caption used to share the video.\n\nIt has also been circulated on Twitter.\n\nIn the background, some people can be heard talking but the language they speak isn\u2019t Bengali. We found that several people had commented that the video depicts an incident which took place two years ago in Surat. A few others also said that the language spoken in the clip was Kathyawadi, the dialect of the Saurashtra region of Gujarat.\n\nUpon searching the keywords \u201cBJP rally Surat\u201d, we were directed to YouTube link of ABP News from December 7, 2017, which carried the same video. According to ABP News, BJP workers were manhandled and their caps were flung in the air before prime minister Modi\u2019s rally. Gujarat underwent assembly elections in 2017.\n\nThe video was initially uploaded by Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mewani.\n\nAn incident from Gujarat was falsely circulated on social media as a case of Rohingya and Bangladeshi refugees mistreating BJP workers in Bengal in the recent Lok Sabha elections. Recently, we had debunked a video from Bihar, which was viral as a BJP worker attacked in West Bengal.", "lang": "en"}
