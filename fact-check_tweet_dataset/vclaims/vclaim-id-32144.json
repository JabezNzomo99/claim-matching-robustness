A Sept. 30 tweet from the state party about Trump's \"toxic record\" included a graphic that says \"$575 billion cut from Medicare in Trump\u2019s proposed 2020 budget.\"\n\nThat statement is misleading. That is a projected reduction of future spending over a decade for the health care program for the elderly. And it\u2019s worth noting that President Barack Obama called for trimming Medicare spending, too.\n\nThe first thing to know about Trump\u2019s 2020 budget proposal is that it is just an expression of Trump\u2019s priorities and ideas. The changes proposed by Trump to slow down the growth in spending will only occur if Congress passes a law.\n\nMedicare spending rises just about every year in Trump's budget proposal. Medicare is projected to grow by about $10 trillion over a decade.\n\nThe Medicare cost reduction under Trump\u2019s budget is expected to be roughly $600 billion over the next 10 years, when compared to current spending levels, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analysis in May.\n\nThe bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget largely agrees, saying Trump\u2019s budget proposal reduces Medicare spending by $515 billion or $575 billion.\n\nAbout 85% of the savings comes from reductions in what Medicare pays to providers.\n\n\"Those cuts would primarily reduce what Medicare pays providers, and I would not expect them to have negative effects on Medicare beneficiaries,\" Matt Fiedler, an economics fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, previously told PolitiFact. \"The budget\u2019s Medicare proposals are also, in my view, largely sensible policy.\"\n\nNot all of the proposed cuts land on providers, however.\n\nChanges in Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription drug insurance program might be the clearest example of Medicare cuts in the Trump budget that affect ordinary Americans. While one proposal would cap out-of-pocket costs for people with the very highest drug costs, another would expose people below that cost level to higher fees. At the end of the day, the Trump budget reduces payments for people who rely on prescription drugs by $50 billion. The idea of reducing the growth of Medicare isn\u2019t new \u2014 and many of Trump\u2019s ideas build upon ideas originally proposed in President Obama's budgets.\n\nObama\u2019s last budget proposed trimming Medicare spending by $420 billion over 10 years. (Republicans accused Obama and Democrats of cutting Medicare many times, a claim we never rated better than Half True.)\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party tweeted \"$575 billion cut from Medicare in Trump\u2019s proposed 2020 budget.\"\n\nThere is some truth to the attack.\n\nBut the Democrats omit that the figure pertains to an amount of reduced spending over a decade. Also, it is a proposed reduction relative to projected future spending. Medicare spending will still rise overall.", "lang": "en"}
