This is like comparing apples to a basket of vegetables.\n\nThe UK\u2019s EU membership fee, minus what the EU spends in the UK, has averaged around \u00a39 billion over the last few years. Meanwhile the CBI estimates being in the EU leads to a financial gain of \u00a373-\u00a391 billion a year. This is also where the \u00a391 billion claim comes from. It\u2019s equivalent to about 4-5% of the size of the UK\u2019s economy.\n\nWhile our membership fee is an exact figure, the financial benefit of being in the EU is highly uncertain.\n\nThe CBI\u2019s estimate is based on a selection of studies produced at different times (some date back well over a decade), with different methodologies, and designed to answer different questions. Some looked at the economic impact of EU membership to date, and some at the future impact of a vote to leave. Some are not even specific to the UK.\n\nWhile some of these studies have attempted to account for what the financial costs and benefits might have been had the UK not joined the EU, it\u2019s very difficult to do this, and impossible to put a precise figure on it.\n\nAs for how the NHS would be affected if we leave, most economists seem to agree that leaving the EU would cost the UK economically, which could mean less money available overall. All other things being equal if there is less money in the economy there will be less money for anything the government wants to spend money on.\n\nWhether the NHS actually gains or loses when the economy grows or shrinks depends on the policy the government chooses to adopt. The Coalition government protected NHS spending at a time when most other areas saw spending reductions, although the NHS was and still is being asked to make efficiency savings.", "lang": "en"}
