Marco Rubio.\n\nRubio said as much by tweeting back the same day, saying Clinton \"can't lecture me on student loans. I've had student loans & I have a plan to modernize higher ed.\" He then linked to a statement on his website excoriating Clinton for planning to put tax dollars into an \"outdated system.\"\n\nClinton\u2019s own idea is a 10-year, $350 billion plan called the \"New College Compact.\" Clinton proposed in August to allow students to attend public colleges without taking out loans to pay tuition. Families would be required to contribute and federal spending would be expanded, but with controls on spending by colleges and universities. Clinton\u2019s campaign has not offered many details beyond the price tag and told PolitiFact Florida they had nothing to add to her tweet.\n\nRubio has been talking about the issue since at least February 2014, when he made a major policy speech about controlling crippling college debt. He repeated his positions in a July speech after he declared his candidacy.\n\u2022 Establishing a new accreditation process for nontraditional education. Rubio has not said what these \"innovative, low-cost competitors\" are, but they are generally considered to be for-profit universities, online courses and others.\n\u2022 Requiring schools to tell students what kind of salary they can expect to earn with every degree.\n\u2022 Basing loan repayment plans on the amount of money a graduate makes annually.\n\u2022 Allow student investment plans, in which investors would pay for a student\u2019s tuition in exchange for a percentage of their post-graduation income for a number of years, whether that covers the investment or not.\n\u2022 Expanding apprenticeship and vocational programs for students who don\u2019t want or need to go to a tradition two- or four-year college.\n\nSome other candidates have also brought up tuition increases, student debt and federal spending on higher education. In June, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie laid out several ideas for reforming post-secondary education with an eye on reining in costs.\n\nChristie suggested itemized tuition bills that detailed what the money was paying for; allowing students to pay just for classes and not facilities or add-ons; and letting students obtain private financing for college with an option to pay it back with a percentage of earnings after graduation. He also floated ideas of providing tax credits for apprenticeship programs and for donating to debt reduction organizations that help students pay for schooling in exchange for community service.\n\nCarly Fiorina, the former technology executive, said in a July Q&A on Breitbart.com that student debt was out of control because \"the federal government under Democrats has nationalized the student loan business.\" She suggested letting private banks compete for student loans. She also said the accreditation process should allow for more for-profit universities and online courses.\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said in April 2015 he thought college tuition should be tax deductible, although he did not offer specifics of how that plan should work.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush earlier in August sparred with Clinton on Twitter about tuition, while Ben Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon, in February wrote a Washington Times editorial suggesting needy people should get jobs if they require help paying for college.\n\nOther candidates have been even less vocal on the subject, saying simply that college costs are a problem that have been dealt with, or nothing at all.\n\nClinton said, \"Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college.\"\n\nWhile some Republican hopefuls haven\u2019t had much to say on the issue, it\u2019s not accurate to say none of them have. Rubio has made higher education spending a major plank of his campaign, and other candidates like Christie and Fiorina have set forth ideas and positions. Other candidates have at least mentioned the subject at times.", "lang": "en"}
