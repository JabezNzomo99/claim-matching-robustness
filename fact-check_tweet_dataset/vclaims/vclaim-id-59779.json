In this regard, it is not a coincidence that prior to our national elections of 2019, Al-Jazeera released a documentary with the intent to influence the outcome of our elections. Similarly, as we approach another election later this year, Al-Jazeera is resurfacing with more so-called expos\u00e9s. In the world of politics, these are not coincidences.\u201d\n\nQatar-based satellite news broadcaster Al Jazeera aired its Anatomy of a Bribe documentary, about the \u2018Fishrot\u2019 fisheries corruption scandal, on Sunday, 1 December 2019, four days after the National Assembly and presidential elections of 27 November 2019. The documentary was also broadcast after the elections results had officially been announced on the evening of Saturday, 30 November 2019.\n\nThis was not the first time the Namibian president had made this claim.\n\nDuring the first Cabinet meeting of 2020, on Tuesday, 4 February 2020, president Hage Geingob made the same claim \u2013 that Al Jazeera\u2019s documentary based on the Fishrot Files had been broadcast ahead of the 2019 elections.\n\nHere\u2019s Namibia Fact Checks debunk of the claim at the time:", "lang": "en"}
