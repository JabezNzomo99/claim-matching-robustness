The strike was carried out by \n\nMirage 2000 fighter jets at 3.30 am.\n\nHowever, a video clip doing the rounds on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter is not from the air strike.\n\nBOOM broke up the video into key frames and ran a reverse image search which did not yield anything. We then ran a manual search for video games and simulation videos.\n\nWe found the video uploaded to YouTube on July 9, 2015 with the caption 'Really Short Engagement (ft. Taliban) - Apache Gunner FLIR Cam #6 - Arma 2'.\n\nARMA 2 is a military simulation video game. The video is not actual footage of an airstrike. \n\n\n\nThe description below the title says, \"Gunner perspective in the US Army Apache during battle, using FLIR camera with M230 sound mod.
