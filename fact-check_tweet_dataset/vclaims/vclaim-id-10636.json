Right before boarding on an airplane we hold onto our boarding passes like our lives rely on upon it. But after we boarded, many, if not all of us, doesn\u2019t care anymore about this ticket. Sometimes we throw it in the plane, other times we left it in the hotel room, or just chuck it. But this careless can get you into so much trouble. According to \u201cKrebs on Security\u201d there is personal information encrypted on your boarding pass. After someone took a screen shot of the bar code on the ticket, you will be amazed of how much personal information that person can get about you: home address, banking info, email address, phone number.\n\nThat personal information is unlikely to allow thieves to tap into one's bank account.\n\nA determined person might be able to obtain some nuggets of personal information (of marginal value) from a discarded boarding pass.\n\nIn early 2016, multiple web sites published breathless warnings about how social media users would \u201cnever believe\u201d how dangerous it was to discard boarding passes. One such version reported:\n\nThe travel-related warning was reminiscent of the widely-circulated stories about the hidden dangers of hotel key cards and helping fellow airport travelers by holding their water bottles. In this case, the viral \u201cboarding pass\u201d items were mostly sourced from a far less alarmist source, a KrebsOnSecurity article from October 2015.\n\nThe author of that piece explained that he had heard from a longtime reader, who said he \u201cbegan to get curious about the data stored inside a boarding pass barcode after a friend put a picture of his boarding pass up on Facebook,\u201d before going on to document a complex series of steps he used to test his hypothesis:\n\n\u201cI found a website that could decode the data and instantly had lots of info about his trip \u2026 Besides his name, frequent flyer number and other [personally identifiable information], I was able to get his record locator (a.k.a. \u201crecord key\u201d for the Lufthansa flight he was taking that day \u2026 I then proceeded to Lufthansa\u2019s website and using his last name (which was encoded in the barcode) and the record locator was able to get access to his entire account. Not only could I see this one flight, but I could see ANY future flights that were booked to his frequent flyer number from the Star Alliance.\u201d The access granted by Lufthansa\u2019s site also included his friend\u2019s phone number, and the name of the person who booked the flight. More worrisome, Cory now had the ability to view all future flights tied to that frequent flyer account, change seats for the ticketed passengers, and even cancel any future flights \u2026 information contained in the boarding pass could make it easier for an attacker to reset the PIN number used to secure his friend\u2019s Star Alliance frequent flyer account. For example, that information gets you past the early process of resetting a Star Alliance account PIN at United Airline\u2019s \u201cforgot PIN\u201d Web site. After that, the site asks for the answer to a pre-selected secret question. The question in the case of Corey\u2019s friend was \u201cWhat is your Mother\u2019s maiden name?\u201d That information can often be gleaned by merely perusing someone\u2019s social networking pages (e.g., does your aunt or uncle on your mom\u2019s side have your mother\u2019s maiden name as their last name? If so, are they friends with you on Facebook?)\n\nThe KrebsOnSecurity article described a process that was both time-consuming and laborious, and provided little information that would be truly useful to potential thieves. For example, the risks cited involved not the draining of bank account, but the potential resetting of the PIN used to access frequent flyer miles.\n\nAfter what appeared to be a moderate to intensive effort, all the information extracted in the provided example was described as \u201cthe ability to view all future flights tied to that frequent flyer account, change seats for the ticketed passengers, and even cancel any future flights.\u201d\n\nMany such operations with online accounts require the user to answer one of more security questions, and the answers to those questions are not something a potential thief would be able to glean from a discarded boarding pass. The article hypothesized that thief might be able a to answer a simple security question such as \u201cWhat is your mother\u2019s maiden name?\u201d by gathering that information from a flyer\u2019s social media accounts.\n\nWe contacted travel expert and consumer advocate Christopher Elliott for additional information on the claims, who noted in reply that the risks expressed were more hypothetical than actual:\n\nLike Elliott, we were unable to uncover any indication thieves were routinely (or even rarely) plumbing discarded boarding passes to steal anyone\u2019s personal information, and much of the \u201csensitive information\u201d the warning cited was printed in plain text on the front of the boarding passes.\n\nA JetBlue representative provided us with additional information about how boarding pass QR or bar codes worked. The representative affirmed the encoded information approximately matched the text printed on the pass and did not contain other sensitive information (such as bank details). However, he noted that sharing boarding passes to social media while en route presented a marginal risk of hassle to some passengers (largely unrelated to the warning).\n\nA representative from Southwest Airlines also explained to us that no sensitive information was encoded into that carrier\u2019s boarding passes:\n\nAmong information generally contained on a boarding pass was a traveler\u2019s confirmation code. Armed with a confirmation code and a passenger\u2019s ticketed name, mischievous individuals potentially possess the ability to cancel a ticket mid-journey. The Southwest rep confirmed that by and large that held true across the industry and advised travelers to be mindful when sharing their itineraries to social media.", "lang": "en"}
