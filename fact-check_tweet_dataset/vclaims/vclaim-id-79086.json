McAuliffe is saying his opponent is open to expelling 8 percent of them in favor of cut taxes.\n\nIn May, Cuccinelli announced a to slice the top personal income tax bracket from 5.75 to 5 percent and the corporate income tax rate 6 percent to 4 percent. After they\u2019re fully implemented over four years, the cuts would reduce general fund revenues by $1.4 billion annually. Cuccinelli said he would offset the loss by eliminating tax loopholes and exemptions and limiting the increase in new spending.\n\nMcAuliffe arrived at his layoff figure by extrapolating numbers in report critical of Cuccinelli\u2019s tax plan by the Virginia Education Association, an organization representing more than . The group has McAuliffe for governor.\n\nDuring this budget year, which began July 1, the state will spend just under 30 percent of its general fund dollars on public schools. About $5.3 billion of the $17.6 billion fund has been appropriated for K-12 education. Cuccinelli\u2019s $1.4 billion tax cut comes to just 8 percent of the current general fund.\n\nThe VEA assumed that all major programs in the general fund -- mostly education, health and public safety -- would be cut by 8 percent to pay for Cuccinelli\u2019s tax plan. That would come to about a $420 million reduction for education. The average salary and benefits total for a teacher is $64,635, the VEA said, so a $420 million loss would amount to losing support for about 6,530 . McAuliffe these findings on Facebook.\n\nBut McAuliffe\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t stop there. It ran its own numbers with an assumption that education would be cut more than other general fund programs. For example, Medicaid has been taking a growing share of the budget -- 21 percent in fiscal year 2012. Because it\u2019s an entitlement program, it would be very difficult to cut, the campaign says.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s advisers pointed to several other general fund programs that they said are locked in or difficult to cut, such as debt service and money for the judicial and legislative branches. When these programs are taken off the table, the campaign says education comprised 37.5 percent of the remaining general fund.\n\nSo McAuliffe\u2019s people concluded that Cuccinelli might have to rely on education to pay for 37.5 percent of his $1.4 billion tax cuts. That comes out to $525 million.\n\nAnd when they divided $525 million by the average salary and benefits cost for a teacher, they came up with 8,122 teachers who could be laid off.\n\nCuccinelli says he is not contemplating cutting education and has his opponent for making a \"false and misleading\" attack.\n\nDespite all the assumptions McAuliffe built into his estimate, he ignored Cuccinelli\u2019s important pledge to offset the cost of the tax cut by eliminating some tax loopholes and cap the growth in state spending.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s campaign is cynical about the pledge, accurately noting that Cuccinelli has a single loophole he\u2019d be willing to close. Cuccinelli says he would appoint a commission to rank tax exemptions in order of their effectiveness and urge the General Assembly to repeal the worst ones.\n\nThere may be plenty of slack in Virginia\u2019s loopholes. A report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission valued the exemptions allowed in 2008 at $12.5 billion. That almost equals the $14.3 billion in general fund taxes the state collected that year.\n\nMost of the exemptions were approved for tax policy reasons, such as conforming certain Virginia tax laws to federal codes or weeding out inconsistencies that could lead to double taxation, according to the report.\n\nBut JLARC also found that about $2.9 billion of the breaks were designed to promote public policies, such as helping the coal industry or encouraging land preservation. Many of these, JLARC said, could be easily eliminated or streamlined \"without undermining principles of sound tax policy.\"\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s estimate also ignores revenue offsets that would come from Cuccinelli\u2019s policy of capping spending increases to the combined annual rises in Virginia\u2019s rates of inflation and population growth.\n\nLast year, the general fund budget grew by 5.8 percent while the combined rates of inflation and population growth expanded by 3.3 percent. Had Cuccinelli\u2019s cap been in effect, the state would have spent about about $415 million less.\n\nThere\u2019s one last important point that McAuliffe also ignored: Cuccinelli has promised he would abandon his tax cuts if he and the General Assembly cannot agree on a way offset their costs.\n\n\"If I don\u2019t succeed in reining in government growth and if I don\u2019t succeed in getting the exemptions and loopholes identified to pay for the tax cuts, we don\u2019t get the tax cuts,\" Cuccinelli said during a July 20 with McAuliffe.\n\nMcAuliffe says that under Cuccinelli\u2019s tax cut plan, \"school divisions across Virginia could be force to fire over 8,000 teachers.\"\n\nThe claim is based on assumptions that ignore Cuccinelli\u2019s promise to offset the $1.4 billion cost of his tax cut by closing tax loopholes and capping the increase of future spending. Cuccinelli has frustrated many by refusing to name any tax exemptions he would eliminate. But a state auditing commission has said the $12 billion or so in tax breaks given by the state each year is fertile ground to find savings.\n\nMcAuliffe seeks cover for his statement by saying the layoffs \"could\" happen. That overlooks Cuccinelli\u2019s pledge that he\u2019ll abandon the tax cuts if the legislature is unwilling to pay for them by ending loopholes and limiting spending increases.\n\nSo McAuliffe\u2019s doomsday estimate only works by twisting Cuccinelli\u2019s plan into an unrecognizable shape.
