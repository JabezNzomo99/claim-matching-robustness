Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Under Manmohan, 17 Indian Universities were in the World\u2019s Top 300 Universities but, under Modi, there is not even one Indian University in the Top 300. Fact: The available data suggests that Indian Universities were ranked in Top 300 even under the Modi\u2019s government and there is no credible ranking data to suggest that 17 Indian Universities were ranked in World\u2019s Top 300 under the Manmohan\u2019s government. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe post does not mention the name of the rankings. Various world university rankings can be found on the internet. When searched on Google about Indian University not being in Top 300, recent news articles about none of the Indian Universities being ranked in the Top 300 universities in the world by \u2018Time Higher Education 2020 World University Rankings\u2019 can be found in the search results. So, let\u2019s try to check the rankings of the Indian universities on two famous world university rankings \u2013 \u2018Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings\u2019 and \u2018QS World University Rankings\u2019.\n\nOn the website of \u2018Times Higher Education (THE)\u2019, it can be found that the Indian Universities were included in the World University Rankings from the year 2012. So, when checked about the rankings of Indian Universities from 2012 to the latest rankings in 2020, it was found that no more than two Indian Universities were present in each year\u2019s rankings from 2012. In 2020, there was not even one Indian University in the Top 300.\n\nThe data of QS World University Rankings is available only from 2017 on its website. So, when looked for Indian Universities in the top 300, it was found that there are Indian Universities in the Top 300 under the Modi Government.\n\n\n\nSo, from both rankings, it can be concluded that Indian Universities were ranked in Top 300 even under the Modi government. The data for one of these rankings is available only from 2012, so the number of Indian Universities in the Top 300 before 2012 cannot be ascertained. Also, when searched about \u201917 Indian Universities in the World\u2019s Top 300\u2019 on Google, no credible news reports were found. So, from the available data, it can be concluded that Indian Universities performed in the same manner even under the Manmohan\u2019s government.\n\nTo sum it up, under both Manmohan and Modi, the number of Indian Universities in the Top 300 World Universities was dismally low. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
