Twitter handle @SirAiyar posted the video with a message that claimed that the man in the video is Donald Trump. The message also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s recent endorsement of Trump at the Houston event. On September 22, PM Modi had figuratively endorsed Trump for the second term in a public address given at a mega event in Houston. Addressing the crowd, he had said, \u201cAbki baar, Trump sarkaar\u201d. It\u2019s a parody account of Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar.\n\nOne Guddu Yadav posted the video with a message that this is the same man who gave a certificate of \u2018Father of Nation\u2019 to PM Modi and \u2018bhakts\u2019 are celebrating with full zeal and zest. So far his post has been shared more than 36,000 times on Facebook.\n\nIt is apparent from a cursory look, that the man in the video is not the President of the United States, but a lookalike. With a keyword search on Google, Alt News found an article published by UK newspaper Metro on June 6, 2019. According to the report, the name of President Trump\u2019s doppelganger is Dennis Alan.\n\nA caption given to a Getty Images photo of the protest against the state visit of US President, at the Trafalgar Square in London, suggested that the woman in the video whom the lookalike of Trump \u2018groped\u2019 is also a protester. Posted below is the screenshot of an image which was clicked by Mike Kemp on June 4, 2019.\n\nDennis Alan, the doppelganger of Trump is a substitute teacher and musician from Chicago. Metro reported that British artist Alison Jackson had found Alan after a year of searching for a perfect lookalike of Trump. The anti-Trump protest with a woman being shown to be groped by the doppelganger refers to a leaked 1995 recording of Trump making lewd comments about women where he explained how he grabs them by their private parts.\n\nIn conclusion, a video showing a lookalike of US President Donald Trump \u2018groping\u2019 a woman at an anti-Trump protest gathering in London, was suggestively shared as footage of Trump involved in the act.", "lang": "en"}
