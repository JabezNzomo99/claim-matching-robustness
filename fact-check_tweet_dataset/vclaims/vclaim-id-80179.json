In a statement, the company commented that it currently \u201cdoes not extract water from any part of the Guarani Aquifer\u201d and has \u201cno plans to do so\u201d.\n\nA privatisation or conferment of the aquifer would require constitutional reform as the Brazilian Constitution considers all bodies of water, whether above or below ground, as state owned.\n\nThat would require the approval of three fifths of the Senate and the Chamber, which President Temer has found difficult to achieve ahead of presidential and legislative elections this October.", "lang": "en"}
