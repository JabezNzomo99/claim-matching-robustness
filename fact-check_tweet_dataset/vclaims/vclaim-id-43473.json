Ayyub later took down her tweet.\n\nOn March 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown in the country, barring essential services. This has left migrant workers across the country on the streets. There have also been reports of police excess on labourers trying to get to their home states on foot.\n\nThe image was also shared by historian William Dalrymple and the official Twitter handle of JNU Students\u2019 Union. Dalrymple subsequently took down the tweet.\n\nA quick reverse image search on Google redirects to several news reports from March 25 where the photograph has been used \u2013 The Hindu, Financial Expressand Outlook.\n\nAccording to description attached to the image: \u201cPolice personnel punish offenders flouting lockdown guidelines, imposed in wake of coronavirus pandemic, at Chakeri area of Kanpur, on March 24, 2020.\u201d The Hindu credited the photograph to PTI.\n\nAlt News contacted PTI photographer Rahul Shukla who got the photograph shot by a colleague on March 24 after he was informed of the police action. \u201cThis picture was shot at around 1:30 pm. Section 144 was imposed and 75 districts in Uttar Pradesh were under lockdown.\u201d It is noteworthy that UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had announced a lockdown in Kanpur starting March 23. \u201cThese people had stepped out without any reason. Some were on foot while others were on bikes. None of these people was able to prove to the police that they had stepped out for either ration or medicine,\u201d said Shukla.\n\nHe further informed that the police asked those who violated lockdown protocol to show ID cards. \u201cHad these people been migrant workers from say, Delhi or Bihar, they would\u2019ve shown their Aadhaar cards for proof of residence and the police wouldn\u2019t have punished them. But they were unable to provide ID proof.\u201d\n\nThere are also hints in the photograph which suggest that the people being punished are not migrant workers \u2013 motorcycles in the background and the lack of luggage.\n\nAlt News checked the PTI photo gallery and confirmed that the image was indeed shot on March 24.\n\nTherefore, a photograph of police in Kanpur punishing people for stepping out during lockdown was shared as migrant workers being mistreated. Both Ayyub and Dalrymple did not provide clarifications on their incorrect tweets.\n\nAfter Rana Ayyub\u2019s tweet, several users attempted to fact-check her claim and uploaded screenshots asserting that the photograph is from last year. Among them was BJP leader Varun Gandhi\u2019s secretary Ishita Yadav.\n\nTwitter handle @TheSquind also claimed that the image is from 2019.\n\nSo did the handle @erbmjha.\n\nThe image, however, as shown in this article, was shot on March 24, 2020.\n\nDates reflected by Google reverse image search are often inaccurate as the search process frequently throws up results for images which are not the featured/primary images associated with the article but thumbnails of other articles. This happens because many websites list articles related to the report one might be reading. While fact-checking, it is important to open the report and ensure that the image returned during the reverse image search process corresponds to the article in question.", "lang": "en"}
