Rodrigo Duterte in 2018, is the country\u2019s first oil production facility. It\u2019s false.\n\nThat title goes to two oil fields in Nido in the Northwest Palawan Shelf, discovered in 1977 and 1978 and started commercial operations in 1979, according to a Department of Energy briefer and news reports. It ceased operations after 40 years in late 2019.\n\nDuterte has made the same sham claim in a speech in November 2018. (See more: VERA FILES FACT CHECK: In one speech, Duterte unloads 9 false claims)\n\nThe inaccurate report, which a reader asked VERA Files to verify, bore the headline, \u201cFIRST OIL PRODUCTION FACILITY SA PILIPINAS \u2018GUSTO KONG UMIYAK! HINDI TAYO NAKALIMUTAN NG DIYOS!\u2019 IIYAK DILAWAN DITO (First oil production facility in the Philippines \u2018I want to cry! God did not forget us!\u2019 Yellows will cry with this)!\u201d The lone paragraph in the story talked about how the opening of the Alegria oil field brought joy to Duterte. It then featured a Feb. 7, 2020 YouTube video with a title similar to the headline, uploaded by the channel BALITANG BALITA TV.\n\n\u201cYellow\u201d is a colloquial term for members and supporters of the opposition Liberal Party.\n\nOstensibly meant to draw in viewers by showing Duterte in \u201ctears,\u201d News Viral Online misleadingly spliced together in its thumbnail a 2017 photo of him crying as he met with the families of victims of a Davao City mall fire, and a 2018 image of him leading the ceremonial valve opening of the Alegria Oil Field.\n\nThe oil field was scheduled to kick off production testing and drilling in early 2020, according to some news reports last January.\n\nThe spurious article could have reached over 1.5 million netizens, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. Its top three traffic generators are public groups Tatay Digong Supporters, Duterte KFWIPB inc.
