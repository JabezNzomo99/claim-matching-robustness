The term is associated with different moments in history, however there is no evidence to support the claim that it was used to refer to slave trade sales.\n\nThe image shows scores of black men in single file, shackled to each other by the neck. A text has been edited onto the image captioning the picture \u201cBlack Friday 1904\u201d. A Facebook page with over 100,000 followers shared the image on November 23, 2018, with a similar caption.\n\nAnother post on Facebook, with 1,148 shares since November 21, 2018, uses the image with the following caption: \u201c...just a reminder\u201d.\n\nGoogle Reverse Image search results show the picture is linked to a book cover for Chris Owen\u2019s Every Mother's Son is Guilty.\n\nOwen told AFP the image is of Aboriginal prisoners in the Town of Wyndham, Western Australia. He provides a detailed description of the book cover in the introduction of his book and states that when he found the photo in the State Library of Victoria (Melbourne) he had to get permission from the traditional owners to use it.\n\n\u201cThe photo which is a \u2018lantern slide\u2019 has subsequently been colourised (and reversed). It was originally published on 18 February 1905, p.24 in the weekly Western Australian newspaper, Western Mail. The men were imprisoned (for 2/3 years) for alleged cattle killing,\u201c said Owen.\n\nOwen said he had found no reference to the term \u201cBlack Friday\u201d when sourcing the photo or researching the image.\n\n\u201cI make no mention of Black Friday anywhere and have never seen it related to Aboriginal people. I do however talk extensively about Blackbirding which was the name they gave for men who would kidnap Aboriginal men and use them to dive for pearl shell. This was slavery.\u201d\n\nThe author and historian says his understanding of Black Friday relates to American Thanksgiving traditions and retail capitalism. In the Australian context, \u201cit relates to some infamous Bushfires in 1939 (and later bushfires) that killed a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThe author said the Black Friday link to African slavery appeared to be an \u2018urban myth\u2019 as the term came about long after slavery had been abolished.\n\nThe Australian Holocaust, an activist group, posted the picture in April 2016 (later crediting the book), and it has since been shared 57,652 times with 3,285 comments.\n\nSouth African historian Professor Albert Grundlingh of Stellenbosch University also states Black Friday stems from America.\n\n\u201cBasically Black Friday was an attempt by Americans, after Thanksgiving, to shore up their profits just after the public holiday, put them \u2018in the black\u2019 instead of \u2018being in the red\u2019 so it relates to their bank accounts rather than to anything else.\u201d\n\nGrundlingh said the photograph \u201ctells us more about public attitudes and misconceptions than anything in the real world.\u201d\n\nAnother theory for the origin of the term is found by Snopes, dating as far back as 1951, to describe the day after Thanksgiving, a day apparently known for \u201cworker absenteeism\u201d.\n\nMany US employees had the day off, and retailers wanted to kick-start the holiday spending season by tempting them into the shops. This advert supplied by the American Dialect Society suggests the name Black Friday was invented by police in Philadelphia in 1966 to disencourage huge crowds -- without success.", "lang": "en"}
