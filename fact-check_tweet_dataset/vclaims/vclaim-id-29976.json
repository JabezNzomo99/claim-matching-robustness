Vitale, which barred schools and employees acting in their official capacity from prescribing or requiring prayer, equated to banning prayer altogether in public schools.\n\nBut that is not the case. Students and student groups are free to pray at school, as well as participate in any number of religious activities, so long as those activities don\u2019t disrupt school functions or impede the liberties of others.\n\nTrump\u2019s guideline, in fact, largely restated one created by President George W. Bush in 2003. Because students were never barred from praying on their own in school, however, neither president \u201creturned\u201d prayer to public school.\n\nTrump\u2019s guidance, per the Associated Press, buttresses the 2003 guidance by ordering that states \u201cverify that school districts have no policies limiting constitutionally protected prayer, and to refer violators to the Education Department. That\u2019s much like the 2003 guidance, but the new directive goes further by requiring states to provide ways for filing complaints against schools.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Daniel Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, said, \u201cDespite the president\u2019s hype, there\u2019s very little that\u2019s new in today\u2019s \u2018school prayer\u2019 guidance. Importantly, both the Bush guidance and the copycat document released today [Jan. 16, 2020] affirm a core constitutional protection: School officials are prohibited from imposing their faith on students. The question, as always, is whether public-school officials will heed this warning. If they don\u2019t, we\u2019ll be there, as always, to correct them \u2014 and if necessary, we\u2019ll see them in court.\u201d\n\nBecause you can\u2019t bring something back that never left, we rate the claim that Trump \u201creturned\u201d prayer to public schools as \u201cFalse.\u201d Trump did not significantly update guidance from the one issued in 2003 and instead largely reiterated the preexisting rule; also, prayer was never banned in public schools.\n\nTrump also announced a new rule that would make it easier for religious organizations that provide social services to receive federal contracts. As The Washington Post reported:\n\nNine federal agencies, including the Education Department, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department, are advancing rules that would reduce requirements for those religious organizations. The rules would lift an Obama-era executive order that compelled religious organizations to tell the people they serve that they can receive the same service from a secular provider. Civil rights groups said the new regulations will dismantle protections put in place by President Barack Obama to balance the rights of faith-based providers with those of LGBTQ individuals and other groups that have historically faced discrimination. Critics also accused the administration of using the flag of \u201creligious freedom\u201d to give more taxpayer dollars to Christian groups.", "lang": "en"}
