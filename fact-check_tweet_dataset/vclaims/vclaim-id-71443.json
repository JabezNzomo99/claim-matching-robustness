The claim is false; the photo has circulated in reports since February 2019 about a Hindu festival.\n\nThe photo was shared on Facebook here on May 19, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi caption translates as: \u201cShameful! This is not a traffic jam. Priyanka Gandhi has arranged 1000 buses to take labourers to their homes but Yogiji is not giving permission !!\u201d\n\nPriyanka Gandhi is a prominent politician and the current general secretary of the Indian National Congress (INC), India\u2019s main opposition political party.\n\nYogiji refers to Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and a leading figure in India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nIn late May 2020, Gandhi was eventually forced to recall hundreds of buses that her party had sent to Uttar Pradesh to provide transport for stranded migrant workers after they were blocked at the border. The development was reported here by Indian television channel NDTV and here by Indian newspaper the Hindustan Times on May 20.\n\nThe photo was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here and here; and on Twitter here, here, here and here.\n\nA reverse Google image search found that the photo was published by ANI, an Indian news agency, on Twitter here on February 28, 2019, more than one year before Gandhi\u2019s attempt to transport migrants.\n\nANI reported that the photo shows a queue of over 500 buses in Uttar Pradesh that was organised during Kumbh Mela, a major Hindu festival, and that set a world record for the longest fleet of buses.\n\nThe photo was also published with credit to ANI in several other Indian media reports on February 28, 2019, for example here by Financial Express and here by NDTV.\n\nUttar Pradesh\u2019s world record for the \u201clargest parade of buses\u201d is recognised by the Guinness World Records here.\n\nThe INC also refuted the claim about the photo.\n\n\u201cThis is true that we have sought permission from the state government to run a thousand buses, but this photo has nothing to do with our efforts to arrange buses for migrant workers,\u201d Mohit Pandey, the INC\u2019s head of social media in Uttar Pradesh, told AFP by phone on May 19, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
