Some of those can be viewed below.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Lamba took to twitter to call out the trolls for the edited image and expressed concern over women's safety. Her tweet when translated, \"Illiterate, blind Bhakts are spreading indecent comments by tampering one of my photos. I just want to say that these are the people whose mothers, sisters and other women in their house shut doors from inside while they sleep because of fear. Do not leave them.\"\n\nBOOM found the original image of Lamba, where she can be seen flaunting the badge of the Indian tricolour and not the Congress' symbol. Lamba had tweeted a series of photographs wearing the badge pinned to her T-shirt on August 15.", "lang": "en"}
