It was created by a publication that calls its work satire.\n\nHalf of House Democrats have now signaled that they support launching an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far resisted, insisting instead that Democrats should continue their investigations into Trump before proceeding to impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe decision will be made in a timely fashion \u2014 this isn\u2019t endless \u2014 and when we have the best, strongest possible case,\u201d Pelosi said at a recent press conference.\n\nA fictitious headline circulating on social media, however, erroneously claims that Pelosi is already prepared to \u201cdrop\u201d the idea of impeachment in exchange for \u201camnesty\u201d for immigrants.\n\n\u201cPelosi Offers to Drop Impeachment In Exchange For Full Immigrant Amnesty,\u201d the headline reads.\n\nThat story was published on dailyworldupdate.us, one of many websites operated by the publication America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which claims its work is satire. We\u2019ve written many times about the publication\u2019s content, which is often erroneously spread as news.\n\nAt least three other websites also republished the story, without the disclaimers included on dailyworldupdate.us. (\u201cSatire for Flat Earthers, Trumpsters and Y\u2019All Qaeda,\u201d the dailyworldupdate.us nameplate reads).\n\nThose who click beyond the viral headline would see obvious signs of the story\u2019s suspect nature. For example, a photo caption claims that Pelosi \u201calso added a rider to get Congress it\u2019s [sic] own private Dave and Busters. With at least three Galaga machines. And a Phoenix.\u201d\n\nBut those signs \u2014 and the disclaimers on the original story \u2014 aren\u2019t visible to Facebook users in pro-Trump groups who spread and opine on the headline as if the story is real.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
