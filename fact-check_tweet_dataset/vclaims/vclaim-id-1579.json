{"title": "A&E waiting times: better or worse?", "subtitle": "More patients are being seen within four hours at A&E departments, but the percentage of visits processed within that time has been falling.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-1579", "url": "https://fullfact.org/health/a-e-waiting-times-better-or-worse/", "vclaim": "The number of A&E visits that took more than four hours to process did hit 1.8 million in 2015/16, according to data from NHS Digital. The previous year it was 1.4 million.\n\nThe Prime Minister replied that 2,500 more daily visits are being processed within four hours. That\u2019s also true: over 900,000 more annually since 2009, if you look at all types of A&E departments. Both the \u2018good\u2019 and the \u2018bad\u2019 figures can be on the rise simultaneously, as many more people are visiting A&E overall.\n\nLooking just at \u2018major\u2019 A&E departments, however, the number being seen within four hours has actually fallen over the same period. And on either measure, the percentage of patient visits being dealt with within four hours has dropped from 98% to around 90% last year.\n\nThe target has been 95% since 2010. It used to be 98%.\n\nThese annual figures doesn\u2019t tell us about A&E performance this winter. The very latest data available, for October 2016, shows that the figure for those treated in under four hours in \u2018major\u2019 departments\u2014big 24-hour A&Es staffed by consultants\u2014was down to 84%.\n\nA footnote: in all cases, these figures are for the number of attendances at A&E rather than the number of individual patients. They also cover England only.", "lang": "en"}
