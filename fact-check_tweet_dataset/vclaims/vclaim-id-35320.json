The video is viral with the claim it is from Uttar Pradesh (UP). The accompanying message in Hindi text, \u201cDevelopment of poverty-free India beings from UP [Translated from: \u0917\u0930\u0940\u092c\u0940 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0948\u092f\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0964 \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0938\u0947 \u0936\u0941\u0930\u0942\u0964].\u201d\n\nOn February 5, Bhuvan Chandra Yadav Budhana posted the video on Facebook with the viral text. It has been viewed over 40,000 times and has close to 3,000 retweets.\n\nSeveral social media users have shared it on Twitter and Facebook. Alt News has received several requests to fact-check the viral video on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official mobile app. Alt News performed keyframe analysis using InVID and did a reverse-image search on Yandex. The first result was of a YouTube video with the hashtags #Utkalkhabar #odisha #bhubaneswar. However, the video was removed by the user.\n\nUsing the hashtags as a clue, Alt News performed a keyword search on YouTube and found that the viral video was uploaded by OTV, an Odisha-based news channel, on January 24. This video has a higher resolution and is shot from a different angle.\n\nAlt News analysed both the videos and spotted three common elements in the viral video and one uploaded by OTV.\n\nAlt News noticed that the crane has the logo of Terex in both the videos.\n\nAlt News noticed that a man in half-sweater can be spotted in both the videos.\n\nIn both the videos, a red truck was present at the demolition site.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the viral video is from UP is false. The video is from Bhubaneshwar Municipal Corporation\u2019s eviction drive near Unit 1 Market on January 24.", "lang": "en"}
