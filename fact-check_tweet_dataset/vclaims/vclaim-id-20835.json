At the time the claim was made, it hadn\u2019t withdrawn funding for a planned tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, but it was announced more recently that this too had been cancelled.\n\nBack in 2012, the Coalition government announced plans to extend the electrification of the Great Western main line (already planned to go from London Paddington to Cardiff) all the way to Swansea.\n\nThis was part of a \u00a33 billion scheme to electrify a number of sections of railway line; also included were the routes between Bedford and Kettering, Corby, Nottingham and Sheffield, as well as track between Oxenholme and Windermere.\n\nAnalysis by the National Audit Office found that the proposed costs of electrifying the Cardiff to Swansea section of the line had risen in real terms from around \u00a3295 million in 2013 to \u00a3433 million in 2016.\n\nAll three schemes were cancelled by the Department for Transport in 2017. The government said that it was \u201cdelivering the largest upgrade of the rail network since Victorian times\u201d along the lines earmarked for electrification, and that \u201cnew technologies mean that we can improve journeys for passengers\u201d without electrification.\n\nIn response the Welsh government said it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d and that the scheme would have \u201cdelivered significant and much-needed improvements to journeys between Wales\u2019 two largest cities and to the communities along the route.\u201d\n\nThe proposed tidal lagoon power plant in Swansea Bay would be able to generate electricity for 155,000 homes, according to the developer. It would be the \u201cpathfinder project\u201d and the first of six planned lagoons generating renewable electricity around England and Wales.\n\nAlthough the funding for the project would come from private investment, it would require some subsidy from the government in the form of a Contract for Difference (CFD).\n\nA CFD would fix \u201cthe prices received by low carbon generation, reducing the risks they face, and ensuring that eligible technology receives a price for generated power that supports investment. CfDs also reduce costs by fixing the price consumers pay for low carbon electricity\u201d, according to the House of Commons Library.\n\nIn March 2015 the government announced it had started negotiations on a CFD which \u201cis affordable and value for money for consumers.\u201d In June that year it also announced that planning permission had been given to build the lagoon. There are also ongoing discussions with the Crown estate about leasing the seabed and with Natural Resource Wales on the granting of a marine licence.\n\nAt the end of 2016 an independent review was published looking into the feasibility of tidal lagoons in the UK. It recommended that for the Swansea Bay project the government should \u201cmove to a timely \u2018final-stage negotiation\u2019 to explore robust and satisfactory terms that might be acceptable to both the developer and the Government.\u201d The project could then be used to measure whether other such tidal lagoons would be feasible.\n\nThe House of Commons Library has written more about the costs and benefits of the project here.\n\nThe Welsh First Minister, Carwyn Jones, had written to the UK government proposing that the Welsh government provide \u00a3200 million funding for the project and setting out how he thinks CFD could work.\n\nWhen the claim was made, the UK government had neither cancelled the project nor given it the go ahead. It was reported just over a week later that the project had in fact been thrown out by the UK government, on the grounds that it wasn\u2019t considered value for money. It had previously said it was supportive of the tidal lagoon project but that it needed to prove this value for money.", "lang": "en"}
