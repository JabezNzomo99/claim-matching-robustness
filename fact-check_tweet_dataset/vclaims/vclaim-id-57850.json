However, the man pictured here is not Cantrell but Brian Cash, a 52-year-old flooring installer from New Hudson, Michigan.\n\nCash confirmed to the Detroit Free Press that he was the man in the photograph but disputed the idea that he was yelling at the two pictured officers. Cash claims that he was actually yelling at an officer out of frame who, according to Cash, had assaulted a woman the day prior:\n\nCash said he wasn\u2019t yelling at the state troopers seen in the photo \u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t scream in anybody\u2019s face\u201d \u2014 but at an officer positioned behind them who he said he saw assault a woman the day before. Three women were removed from the public gallery for the state House of Representatives on April 29. The incident was caught on video, showing a woman being forcibly removed. The incident prompted an announcement by the Michigan State Police that it was investigating the confrontation between individuals and House police. The next day, when the now-infamous photo of him was taken, Cash said he was in the Capitol when he saw the officer. \u201cI was there chanting, \u2018Let us in,\u2019 and I saw that guy and I just, I just kind of lost it a little bit,\u201d Cash said. He said that he was asking the man, whom he called a \u201cred coat,\u201d a reference to the red coats they wear, \u201cif he wanted to try to throw me around like he did that girl yesterday.\u201d\n\nThis viral photograph was taken by Jeff Kowalsky during an anti-lockdown protest dubbed an \u201cAmerican Patriot Rally\u201d inside Michigan\u2019s Capitol building. Here\u2019s the original picture along with the correct caption:", "lang": "en"}
