That said, the same experts warn this won\u2019t be enough to make the system sustainable.\n\nMr Corbyn is referring to day-to-day spending by local councils in his claim, using estimates from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS).\n\nAn ADASS report in June 2015, based on a survey of its members, claimed that there had been a \u00a34.6 billion reduction in adult social care budgets between 2010/11 and 2015/16.\n\nIt only put \u00a31.6 billion of this down to cash reductions. The balance was down to more older and disabled people needing care (\u00a31.75 billion) and price pressures (\u00a31.25 billion).\n\nWe\u2019re looking in to the figures in more detail and will update when we know more.\n\nMrs May, meanwhile, is talking about more recent changes to funding. In 2015 the government announced changes, including a \u2018social care precept\u2019 allowing councils to raise council tax by up to 2% a year to fund social care, and putting more central government money into the \u2018Better Care Fund\u2019 designed to help the NHS and councils coordinate social care.\n\nProjections suggest spending will rise over this parliament, although that depends on how much councils decide to and manage to raise.\n\nWe\u2019ve changed our conclusion from \u201cCorrect according to the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services\u201d. This overstated what we knew at the time about the research behind the figure, and didn\u2019t address what the \u00a34.6 billion represented. We\u2019re looking in more detail into the figure and we\u2019re hoping to update the article when we know more.", "lang": "en"}
