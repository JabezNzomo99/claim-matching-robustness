In 2017, the median hourly wage for women working full time was about 9.1% less than the median hourly wage for men (excluding overtime). That\u2019s \u00a31.32 less per hour.\n\nWomen also do more part time work than men. If you count part-time wages too, the gender pay gap rises to 18.4%, or \u00a32.52 per hour.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics says there isn't a single number that adequately deals with all the issues surrounding differences between women and men's pay, but they prefer to look at median hourly earnings.\n\nWhat does that actually mean?\n\nThe gender pay gap is the difference between men\u2019s and women\u2019s earnings. It is normally calculated by subtracting median hourly earnings for women from median hourly earnings for men. The difference is the gender pay gap.\n\nThis difference can also be expressed as a percentage of male earnings.\n\nImagine you randomly picked 100 women who work in the UK and lined them up in order of who earns the most per hour, regardless of the hours they worked.\n\nThen imagine you randomly took 100 men and did the same, before standing the two rows face to face.\n\nIf you walked halfway down the row, to the 50th woman and the 50th man, on average that woman would earn \u00a32.52 less per hour than the man she was facing, or 18.4% less.\n\nIf you only lined up people with full-time jobs, you would expect the median woman to earn 9.1% less than the median man, or about \u00a31.32 less per hour.\n\nThe pay gap widens the more you earn\n\nYou would expect the 11th highest earning woman who worked full-time to earn 18.2% less than her male counterpart, about \u00a35.68 less per hour. The 10th lowest earning woman would only earn 5.0% less, about 42p less per hour.\n\nThe differences are bigger if you look at weekly, monthly or annual earnings, since men tend to work more paid hours each week.\n\nThey\u2019re also larger if you included overtime pay, since men tend to do more hours paid overtime. Including overtime pay, the median hourly wage for a woman is 18.9% lower than the median wage hourly wage for a man, if you count full-time and part-time wages. That\u2019s \u00a32.61 less per hour.\n\nFor part time jobs, the gap goes the other way\n\nThe pay gap actually works the other way around for part-time jobs\u2014women get paid more than men. This is called the \u2018negative gender pay gap\u2019.\n\nThe median hourly wage for women who work part-time is 5.1% higher than for men, so about 45p an hour more.\n\nBut the median hourly wage for part-time jobs is 35% lower than the median hourly wage for full time jobs. That\u2019s \u00a34.82 less per hour\u2014much larger than the negative pay gap.\n\nAbout 41% of women who work have part-time jobs, compared to just 13% of men. So the fact that more women do part time work widens the gap overall.\n\nThe gender pay gap has become smaller\n\nThe hourly gender pay gap for full-time workers dropped by 8.3 percentage points from 1997 to 2017, with the pay gap for all workers falling by about 9.1 percentage points.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests one reason for the decline is that the overall level of women\u2018s educational qualifications has increased more quickly than men\u2019s. In the late 2000s women became the more qualified group.\n\nIf we take education into account, we can see that the pay gap hasn\u2019t fallen for everyone.\n\nAlthough it has fallen amongst workers with GCSEs as their highest qualification, the gender pay gap has stayed roughly the same for people with A levels and graduates.\n\nSo the gap has declined overall for two reasons. First, because of the declining gap among workers with only GCSEs. Secondly, because more women have moved into the higher educated, and higher paid, groups.\n\nThe negative gender pay gap for part-time workers increased by about 5.7 percentage points over the last 20 years.\n\nThe gap changes for different age groups\n\nFor full-time employees in their 20s and 30s the pay gap is relatively small. It increases by a large amount for full-time employees in their 40s and 50s, and declines slightly afterwards.\n\nThe negative pay gap for part-time workers only occurs for those under the age of 50. Among older part-time workers, men generally get paid more than women.\n\nHow do we explain this?\n\nPart of the difference is between generations. The pay gap has fallen for people born in later decades.\n\nBut the gap also changes over a single generation\u2019s lifetime. After the age of 30, the average hourly wage for men continues to rise whilst average hourly wages for women stay the same.\n\nThe IFS suggest that this is mainly due to the knock-on effects of women reducing their hours or taking time out of work to have children. It identifies a gradual but continuous rise in the gender wage gap in the twelve years after families have their first child.\n\nThe effect isn\u2019t the same for all women. Highly educated women appear to miss out the most from taking time out of work. The lowest educated women lose out very little on pay increases by reducing their hours or taking time out of work.\n\nThe IFS suggests that the increase in the size of the pay gap is because women lose out on accumulating workplace skills and experience.\n\nBut, as the report says, it\u2019s much easier to spot differences in career patterns than it is to prove they\u2019re the cause of the widening gap.\n\nAnd their account doesn\u2019t explain the part of the gap that exists before the birth of the first child.\n\nThe IFS agreed that their preferred explanation doesn\u2019t rule out alternatives\u2014as long as those alternative explanations account for the data properly. What would that mean?\n\nThey told us that any good explanation would need to account for the slow, cumulative increase in the gap after the birth of the first child.\n\nAnd it would need to explain why a gap exists before people have children.\n\nThe pay gap varies across different types of job\n\nFor full-time employees, the pay gap exists across all the main types of job.", "lang": "en"}
