Al Gore did not predict that, and there was not more ice than ever in 2015. The claims are not entirely baseless (Mr Gore did make more limited inaccurate predictions), but they misinterpret or misrepresent both Mr Gore\u2019s words and what\u2019s happened to the ice caps.\n\nOverall, the amount of polar ice has been declining for decades.\n\nWhat did Al Gore say?\n\nAl Gore did not say that \u201cthe ice caps will melt by 2014\u201d. However (as summarised well by the fact checking website Snopes) he did promote more limited predictions during the late 2000s which did not come true. Specifically, he talked (in imprecise language) about projections that the summer sea ice in the Arctic could have disappeared by that year .\n\nTo understand why that\u2019s not the same as a blanket claim that \u201cthe ice caps will melt\u201d, it\u2019s important to remember that there are two polar regions\u2014the Arctic in the north, and the Antarctic in the south.\n\nBeyond that, there are different types of ice: these include ice sheets, the thick layers of ice covering land masses; ice shelves, which are parts of the ice sheet that extend from the land over the ocean; and sea ice, which is a thinner, free-floating layer of ice made of frozen ocean water.\n\nAnd finally, the amount of ice naturally increases and decreases according to the season, with more ice in the cold winter months and less ice in the summer.\n\nMr Gore\u2019s comments referred to a real projection, made at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union, that was specifically about one type of ice\u2014sea ice\u2014at the North Pole only, in the warmest months of the year. But he didn\u2019t always make clear that this projection was something of an outlier, which suggested faster melting than other scientific models.\n\nHe also used the phrase \u201cNorth Polar ice cap\u201d when talking about the sea ice projection\u2014and while the ice at the North Pole itself is sea ice, there is also an ice sheet covering Greenland, so the phrase could be interpreted as covering a wider area than the projection actually did.\n\nAs Snopes concludes: \u201cThe claim that Gore \u2018predicted\u2019 an ice-free Arctic in 2014 is a simplification of these events. However, Gore was definitely guilty in these cases of cherry-picking science or playing loose with the details of that science.\u201d\n\nWhat actually happened to the ice?\n\nThe second part of the Facebook post similarly makes a mistake by saying that there was \u201cmore ice than ever\u201d in 2015.\n\nWhile wrong, there is a grain of truth here. Antarctic sea ice, specifically, was on a slight upward trend until recently, and did reach its highest level around this time.\n\nThe largest extent of Antarctic sea ice since 1979 (when the modern satellite records begin) was recorded in September 2014, in the Antarctic winter. And on a month-by-month basis, January 2015 outstripped its monthly average by the largest amount (although there was less ice overall, as January is in the Antarctic summer.)\n\nBut other ice types were shrinking at the same time. (Additionally, what\u2019s happening to sea ice is far less important when it comes to sea levels rising than what\u2019s happening to the ice sheets).\n\nIn the Arctic, the extent of sea ice has been declining for decades. There wasn\u2019t \u201cmore ice than ever\u201d on the Arctic Ocean in 2015, either in the summer or the winter\u2014every month in 2015 had a sea ice extent far below the monthly averages for the years 1981-2010.\n\nAs already noted, unlike Arctic sea ice, the extent of Antarctic sea ice has not generally been declining in recent decades. In fact, up to mid-2015, it had been rising slightly. That trend changed dramatically in 2016 and 2017, when it fell to its lowest ever point.\n\nThe reasons why Antarctic sea ice behaves differently to the Arctic are complex and still not fully understood, but relate to the fact that the two poles are\u2026 well, polar opposites: the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land masses, while the Antarctic is a land mass surrounded by ocean.\n\nAnd that means that if you just look at the sea ice around Antarctica, you may get a misleading picture of what\u2019s going on.\n\nSea ice isn\u2019t the only ice, and it\u2019s not the most important\n\nReceding sea ice in the Arctic may be a visible effect of climate change, and have significant effects on the ecosystem, but as we\u2019ve already noted it has relatively little direct effect on sea level rise: the ice layer is comparatively thin, and (because it\u2019s already floating in the sea) it doesn\u2019t raise the water level very much when it melts.\n\nWhat contributes most to sea level rise is the melting of the much thicker ice sheets on land. And here the story from north and south is similar: both the Antarctic ice sheet and the ice sheet covering Greenland have been shrinking for the past two decades, with Greenland currently melting faster.\n\nIn 2015, around the same time Antarctic sea ice was at its largest extent, the Antarctic ice sheet actually hit its lowest point on record. That\u2019s not as contradictory as it might sound, because the cold, fresh meltwater flowing off the ice sheet can actually increase the amount of surrounding sea ice. That\u2019s one reason why just looking at sea ice could give you a misleading impression of what\u2019s happening to Antarctica\u2019s ice overall.", "lang": "en"}
