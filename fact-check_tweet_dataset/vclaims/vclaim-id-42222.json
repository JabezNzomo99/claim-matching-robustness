For decade", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-42222", "url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/feb/15/chuck-mcgrady/nc-republican-half-right-about-gop-support-redistr/", "vclaim": "There\u2019s more support for redistricting reform than meets the eye, according to one North Carolina legislator.\n\nFor decades, North Carolina\u2019s election maps have been criticized as biased toward whichever party controlled the legislature when the maps were drawn. And currently, the state faces four different legal challenges to its maps.\n\nSo Rep. Chuck McGrady, a Republican from Henderson County, hopes the legislature will change its ways before the maps need to be redrawn in 2021. On Feb. 13, McGrady introduced a bill that would shift redistricting responsibilities from the legislature to a committee of non-politicians.\n\nGiven GOP legislators have controlled the state House and state Senate since 2011, it may seem like Republicans aren\u2019t interested in redistricting reform. But that\u2019s not so, McGrady claims.\n\n\"In my caucus, nearly half of the Republicans now serving have voted for this type of bill \u2026 or have cosponsored one or more of the nonpartisan redistricting bills,\" McGrady said Wednesday during a press conference.\n\nThere are currently 65 Republicans in the House. For McGrady\u2019s claim to be correct, about 33 of them need to have previously supported a redistricting bill.\n\nHow close does McGrady come? If we\u2019re talking about House Republicans who supported bills before 2019, McGrady comes up a little short \u2013 something he realized when contacted by PolitiFact.\n\nMcGrady said he got his information from Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause NC, a left-leaning voting rights advocacy group. McGrady miscounted the number of legislators who previously supported nonpartisan redistricting, he said in an email.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t realize I was double counting some members since they were included both as voting for a bill and cosponsoring one or more bills,\" McGrady said, referring to a list he was given.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Republicans who previously supported a nonpartisan redistricting bill aren\u2019t necessarily going to support it this year.\n\nStill, McGrady\u2019s not that far off. His prediction comes close, but only because of Republicans who support his bill this year.\n\nAmong the bills McGrady mentioned in his press conference was House Bill 824, a bill introduced in 2011 that would\u2019ve created a nonpartisan redistricting process.\n\nFive current House members were among the bill sponsors:\n\nTen more voted for the bill at least once:\n\u2022 William Brisson of Bladen (who in 2011 was a Democrat)\n\nThat makes 15 Republican legislators who voted on HB 824.\n\nIn 2013, a bipartisan group of legislators filed another nonpartisan redistricting bill.\n\nThe bill, HB 606, was never put up for a vote. But several Republican supporters of the 2011 bill sponsored HB 606, as well as these six other Republicans:\n\nSo far, that puts our count of nonpartisan redistricting supporters at 21 Republicans.\n\nIn 2015, HB 92 sought to form a nonpartisan redistricting commission. It was never voted on, but several current Republicans supported it, including John Fraley of Iredell County and Lee Zachary of Yadkin.\n\nA similar bill, HB 200, was introduced in 2017 and never voted on. Cody Henson of Transylvania County was among a handful of Republican sponsors.\n\nBy our count, 24 Republican House members supported nonpartisan redistricting bills before this year.\n\nThat brings us to 2019 and the bill McGrady just introduced, HB 69. It\u2019s sponsored by eight Republicans who weren\u2019t already on our list:\n\nThat means, as of 3 p.m. Friday afternoon, 32 House Republicans have cosponsored or voted for a nonpartisan redistricting bill at some point. Additionally, Republican Reps. Greg Murphy of Pitt County and Keith Kidwell of Beaufort signed a pledge with Common Cause NC, to support an independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission.\n\nMcGrady said \"nearly half\" of House Republicans have supported a nonpartisan redistricting bill. Only 24 House Republicans (about 37 percent) supported a nonpartisan redistricting bill before 2019, which isn\u2019t close to half of the 65 GOP House members.\n\nBut, when you consider Republican support for his new bill, he\u2019s pretty much right that nearly half of House Republicans have supported the idea of nonpartisan redistricting at some point. We rate this claim Half True.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
