Under the curbs on movement, Britons have been instructed to leave home only for very limited reasons, including going to supermarkets for vital supplies or for exercise once a day.\n\nThe post contains an image showing two text messages apparently from the sender \u2018UK_GOV\u2019 reading:\n\n\u201cGOV.UK CORONAVIRUS ALERT New rules in force now: you must stay at home. More info & exemptions at gov.uk/coronavirus Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have been outside of your house 3 times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your \u00a330 fine will be added to your bill.\u201d\n\nThe British government said in a statement on March 24 that a text identical to the first would be sent to all members of the public with a registered phone number (here).\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s office confirmed to Reuters that only one text message had been sent, and that any others claiming to be from the British government were fake (here).\n\n\u201cUK Government has sent out only one text message on new rules about staying at home to prevent the spread of #coronavirus (see below). If you see others claiming to be from UK Government, they are false,\u201d a statement posted on the No 10 Press Office Twitter on March 25 said.\n\nThe new measures state that the public should stay at home unless for one of the following reasons (here\n\nShopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible.\n\nOne form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household.\n\nAny medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person.\n\nTravelling to and from work, but only where this absolutely cannot be done from home.\n\nApart from exercise, which is limited to once a day, members of the public are not restricted to how many times they leave the house for reasons approved by the government. However, Britons are asked to make shopping as infrequent as possible.\n\nThe government has announced that those who do not comply with the rules may receive a \u00a330 fine, however these would be spot fines from police, and not fines delivered by text.(here)\n\nFalse: the UK government has not sent citizens text messages to tell them they have been fined for breaching national lockdown rules.
