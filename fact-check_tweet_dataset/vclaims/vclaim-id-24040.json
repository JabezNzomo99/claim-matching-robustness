His basic point is correct: house prices have still gone up far quicker than the average income of people in their twenties. But the difference is slightly less extreme than he suggests.\n\nJeremy Hunt was born on 1 November 1966, meaning that, if he bought his first flat at 29, that would have been at some point between 1 November 1995 and 31 October 1996. The average UK house price over that period was around \u00a357,000. At the end of 2018, the average UK house price was \u00a3231,000, an increase of around 300% as Mr Hunt said.\n\nAs for incomes, we don\u2019t have data going quite back that far, but in 1997, the median weekly income for 22-29 year olds in the UK was \u00a3255, and in 2018 it was \u00a3428. After adjustments for changes in data collection during that time, this works out at a 72% increase\u2014though this figure should be taken with a pinch of salt, given those changes.\n\nSo where did Mr Hunt get his 20% figure from? We\u2019re not entirely sure, but it\u2019s likely Mr Hunt was using wages adjusted for inflation. From 1997 to 2018 the real terms median weekly income for 22-29 year old employees in the UK increased by 14% (so not quite 20%, but much closer to it than 72%). We\u2019ve asked Mr Hunt to clarify.\n\nUsually at Full Fact we advocate talking about money in \u201creal terms\u201d\u2014in other words, adjusted for inflation. If you want a meaningful idea of how wages are changing, you need to take into account how prices are changing at the same time. What you take home from work is only as useful as what it will buy you.\n\nBut in this case, it\u2019s actually more appropriate to use the non-inflated \u201cnominal\u201d figures.\n\nThat\u2019s because real terms data essentially tells you how much more or less someone can buy in general. But in Mr Hunt\u2019s example, he\u2019s not talking about the general purchasing power of people in their twenties. He\u2019s specifically comparing the change in wages to the rise in price of a particular thing\u2014a house. If you use the inflation-adjusted wage figures, you\u2019ve already factored in rising prices, so you get a skewed result.\n\nSo it\u2019s more appropriate to compare the nominal (i.e. not adjusted for inflation) change in incomes, and the nominal change in house prices.\n\nSo, since Mr Hunt bought his first home, wages for people in their twenties have gone up around 70% while house prices have gone up around 300%.\n\nThat still shows it\u2019s more difficult for young people to buy homes now than it was 25 years ago. But not to quite the same degree as Mr Hunt suggested.\n\nThere are a few caveats to note with this data on earnings. It doesn\u2019t covered self-employed people. Also, this data just looks at wage packets, so doesn\u2019t give you a full picture of how peoples\u2019 actual take-home pay has changed since the 1990s, as it doesn\u2019t factor in the change to taxes and benefits.", "lang": "en"}
