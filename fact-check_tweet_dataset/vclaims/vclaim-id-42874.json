THEN WHEN YOU DO REMOVE THE MASK AND START BEING AROUND PEOPLE AGAIN, YOU WILL GET TERRIBLY SICK. ...Then they'll say it's the next wave of corona,\" user Rebecca Stuber posted.\n\nRespondents to the post mostly agreed. \"I literally have a panic attack wearing them. Barely wore them when I was working healthcare,\" read one reply.\n\nMore:Fact check: This optical illusion does not measure your stress levels\n\n\"Now maybe if it would actually help, I might consider wearing it,\" another wrote.\n\nHowever, at least one dissenter wrote, \"I don't care about me (weakening) my immune system, if I get it and bring it home I am basically digging a grave for my immune compromised 4 year old.\"\n\nWearing a face mask can lessen the spread of the coronavirus from a sick person to a healthy individual, according the The Mayo Clinic. Masks are also suggested for people caring for someone with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nHowever, because they are not airtight and can encourage more \u2014 not less \u2014 face-touching, Mayo Clinic advised against masks for healthy people until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its recommendations last month.\n\nIn April, Surgeon General Jerome Adams asked the CDC to review its guidance on face coverings for the general public.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a fair amount of asymptomatic spread, and so we\u2019ve asked the CDC to take another look at whether or not having more people wear masks will prevent transmission of the disease to other people,\u201d Adams said.\n\nThe CDC now recommends wearing cloth face coverings over the nose and mouth in community settings \u2014 such as pharmacies and grocery stores \u2014 to help stop the spread of the virus by asymptomatic carriers. Children younger than 2 years old, people who have trouble breathing, or those incapacitated or unconscious should not cover their faces.\n\nBut face coverings should not be the only defense. People should still practice social distancing by keeping at least 6 feet away from others while in public. Avoid touching your face and promptly remove any sort of mask upon returning home, Mayo Clinic advised.\n\nGovernors in a number of states followed CDC recommendations by requiring residents to wear face coverings in public under various circumstances. As part of their steps to reopen, states like Arizona, Michigan and Ohio are recommending or mandating that people cover their noses and mouths in enclosed spaces.\n\nInternet celebrity Dr. Mikhail \u201cMike\u201d Varshavski addressed the claim about weakened immunity directly in a May 10 YouTube video.\n\n\u201cDuring a pandemic when you need to shelter in place for a period or six to eight weeks, that is not gonna harm your immune system, either up or down, to the point where it\u2019s gonna destroy your flora and now you can\u2019t protect yourself from illness. If that was the case, we would just not survive as humans as long as we have,\u201d Varshavski said. \u201cWe still go to the grocery store, we still walk our dogs, we spend a little time in the park \u2014 that is more than enough exposure to bacteria that your body needs to function optimally.\u201d\n\nHe said an increase in illness after social distancing measures are lifted is likely due to underreporting \u2014 not compromised immunity.\n\n\u201cThose who were having symptoms of some kind of medical condition and didn\u2019t go get care because they were worried about getting sick with COVID-19 are then going to present to the hospital with much more advanced cases,\u201d he said.\n\nWe rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research. Risks associated with wearing face masks only apply to a select few in the general population. The CDC recommends everyone else use cloth face coverings while out in public to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.
