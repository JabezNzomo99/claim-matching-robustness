It\u2019s difficult to say if any protesters were there for that reason, but notices from the organisers, the main opposition MDC party, ahead of the march said it was to demand action from the government as Zimbabwe endures a worsening economic crisis.\n\nOne post on Facebook from November 30, 2018 is a link to an article headlined: \u201cHeavy protest as Zimbabwe's Economy collapses, citizens cry for return of white farmers\u201d. This has been shared 2,552 times.\n\nA few comments on the post prophesy that the same fate will befall South Africans, \u201cTake note South Africans and all that happens here is that the farmers are being slaughtered daily\u201d\n\nAnother comment with 42 likes wrote, \u201cYou got what you wanted, didn't you!! Don't cry now!\u201d in response to the headline.\n\nThe official Twitter account for the main opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), tweeted notices ahead of the demonstration, detailing the cause and the event -- but with no plea for the return of white farmers.\n\nThis was reiterated in a thread from the account titled: \u201cWhy you should Join the Demonstration Tomorrow\u201d. The thread breaks down seven points of promises the party believes Zimbabwe\u2019s President Emmerson Mnangagwa has failed on -- also unrelated to the claim the headline suggests.\n\nAFP attended the demonstration on November 29, 2018 and reported that much of the marchers' anger was focused on Zimbabwe's renewed economic problems. Below is what some participants told AFP:\n\n\"We are here to demonstrate against the economic crisis and the election that was stolen,\" said Donald Bango, a 25-year-old security guard.\n\n\"Prices of basic commodities are going up and we cannot access drugs from pharmacies,\" said Rachel Chakanetsa, a 53-year-old widow who was at the demonstration.\n\nThe marchers delivered a petition to parliament saying Zimbabwe was in \"an unending crisis of legitimacy\".\n\nMany white farmers had their land seized in the years after 2000 under a government policy introduced by then-president Robert Mugabe that was supposedly meant to address colonial inequalities. But much of the land fell into disuse and the collapse of agriculture production hastened the hyperinflation that wrecked the economy.", "lang": "en"}
