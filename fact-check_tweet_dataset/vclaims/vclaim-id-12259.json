Later, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry confirmed the clash had left \u201cdead citizens of Russia and the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries\u201d and \"several dozen\" wounded.\n\n\u200bWagner\u2019s involvement in Syria was first reported in 2017 by Denis Korotkov for the Russian investigative website Fontaka. Kortokov reported that Russian mercenaries first began operating in Syria under the Wagner banner in 2015.\n\nIn compiling their report, The Bell reached out to Yevgeny Prigozhin, popularly known as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef,\u201d who was allegedly picked to handle financing for the group after cutting his teeth as a state catering contractor. Sources told The Bell that Prigozhin had a personal relationship with Putin but was not in his inner circle nor, at the time, as publicly visible as other Putin confidants.\n\n\u200bPrigozhin responded by denying the existence of Wagner Group, telling The Bell the information had been provided through the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in collaboration with Korotkov \u2013 who, he said, was reportedly fired from \"Fontanka\" for publishing unverified information.\n\nPrigozhin said he did not \u201cparticipate in the formulation or implementation of non-existent tasks for a non-existent structure.\u201d\n\nFontanka editor-in-chief Alexander Gorshkov denied that claim, telling The Bell he had not known Korotkov to publish unverified information, adding his August 2018 resignation came as a surprise.\n\nKorotkov, who now works at the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, called allegations he collaborated with the SBU \u201ca blatant and absolute lie,\u201d adding he had resigned from Fontanka of his own volition.\n\nIn October 2017, reports surfaced that Prigozhin had wanted to buy Fontaka. Media magnate Viktor Shkulev ultimately took control of the investigative news outlet.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a body of evidence showing not only that Wagner exists, but that it has links to the Russian state and Prigozhin.\n\nOn Monday, January 28, the SBU said it had intercepted passenger manifests from Russian Defense Ministry-chartered airliners transporting mercenaries working for Wagner to several African and Middle Eastern destinations in the latter half of 2018, the Bellingcat investigative group reported.\n\nThe most \u201cexplosive\u201d allegation involved Wagner mercenaries being issued sequentially numbered international travel passports from the same Moscow-based passport desk that provided fake documents to the GRU officers implicated in the Salisbury poisoning.\n\nIf true, it would demonstrate that Russia not only tolerates Wagner\u2019s activities, but actively supports them, Bellingcat said.\n\nMedia previously reported that Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry had transported and supplied Wagner personnel, with fighters wounded in the February 2018 attack in Syria reportedly turning up in military hospitals in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nThose reports followed claims Wagner had been allowed to use a military base in Molkino, in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region, for training. That facility is also home to the 10th Special Forces Brigade of the GRU (Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency).\n\nIn June 2017, the Russian news outlet RBC reported Prigozhin had participated in several tenders for the maintenance of the Molkino base via the Megaline and Teplosintezm firms, which are associated with his company, Concord Management and Consulting. Another Prigozhin-linked firm advertised positions at the military\u2019s base\u2019s canteen.\n\nA more direct link between Prigozhin and Wagner\u2019s operations in Syria was reported by The Washington Post last February. The newspaper, citing intercepted communications in a U.S. intelligence report, said Prigozhin had been in close touch with Syrian and Russian officials in the run-up to the botched Deir al-Zour assault.\n\nPrigozhin reportedly told a senior Syrian official he had \u201csecured permission\u201d from an unidentified Russian government minister to proceed with \u201ca fast and strong\u201d initiative in early February.\n\nWhile Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry had dismissed early Wall Street Journal reports on Wagner\u2019s operations in Syria as an \u201cinformation attack,\u201d RBC reported that both Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry sources had confirmed Wagner was operating in the country under the auspices of the GRU.\n\nThe Conflict Intelligence Team, a group of Russian open source investigators, subsequently published photographic and documentary evidence of Russian citizens believed to have fought and died for Wagner in Syria.\n\nOne former mercenary who spoke to RBC about his deployment to Syria in 2016 said the company was well supplied. Ammunition was plentiful, and the unit, organized as a \u201cbattalion tactical group\u201d with an estimated total strength of over 2,000 men, was equipped with modern T-72 tanks, D-30 122mm howitzers and BM-21 \u201cGrad\u201d multiple rocket launchers. Pay was high and always on time.\n\nBut in 2016, a Wagner commander told RFE/RL that a disagreement between Prigozhin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu had resulted in much poorer conditions for the mercenaries.\n\n\"They took away the tanks and the weapons,\" the commander said. \"They took back everything they had given earlier. Now the Wagner forces fight with Syrian weapons.\"\n\nMembers of Wagner have also received state medals typically awarded to members of the Russian armed forces, despite the fact that their activities are ostensibly illegal and that Russian authorities, from the Kremlin to the Defense Ministry, have routinely denied knowledge of the group\u2019s operations in Syria.\n\nDmitry Utkin, the alleged head of the group and \u201cretired\u201d GRU special forces commander, who used Wagner as his nom de guerre while fighting in eastern Ukraine in 2014, also attended a Kremlin event marking the Day of Heroes of the Fatherland in December 2016.\n\nKorotkov told Radio Free Europe that Utkin\u2019s presence at that event was \u201cthe clearest indication yet\u201d of Wagner\u2019s role in Russian foreign policy, particularly in Ukraine and Syria.\n\nApart from intercepted communications, Prigozhin has also been linked to Wagner through Evro Polis Ltd firm. Evro Polis has a contract with the Syrian government to protect that country\u2019s oil fields in exchange for a 25 percent share of related oil and gas production.\n\nThat contract is available here.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury, which believes Evro Polis is \"owned or controlled\" by Prigozhin, sanctioned the firm in January 2018.\n\nA source in Russia\u2019s Energy Ministry also linked Prigozhin to Evro Polis in an extensive report published by RBC.\n\nThe United States has sanctioned Prigozhin for his links to Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and indicted him for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election by allegedly bankrolling the Internet Research Agency, a so-called \u201ctroll factory\u201d engaged in online influence operations.\n\nWhen asked by The Bell if a private military company, which exist to make a profit, would have commercial projects related to mining and natural resources, Prigozhin answered \u201cphilosophically\u201d that if such a company \u201ccould exist somewhere abroad,\u201d then it would be engaged in security and military activities. He added there would be \u201cno place\u201d for PMCs in the mining industry.\n\nHe then asked the interviewer to \u201clearn to think logically.\u201d\n\nLogically speaking, there is more than enough evidence demonstrating both the existence of Wagner and its interest in securing Syrian oil fields on behalf of a Russian firm linked to Prigozhin.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds that Prigozhin\u2019s statements to be false.", "lang": "en"}
