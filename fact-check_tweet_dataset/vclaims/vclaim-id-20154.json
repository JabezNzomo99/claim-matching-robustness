This is, in part, correct, but it doesn\u2019t affect the amount of pensions or benefits people get in return for their NICs.\n\nThe source of the viral claims is a response from the Treasury to a freedom of information request earlier this year. In it the government confirms that some of the surplus money it gets in NICs is invested in order to help reduce the national debt.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear hint in the viral posts that spending some NICs on paying down the debt is an inappropriate use of the money, because it means the money isn\u2019t being used on people\u2019s pensions or benefits.\n\nSome of the NICs surplus could, in theory, be put towards increasing pensions or benefits payments. But it\u2019s also important to be clear that no one is getting less than what they\u2019re currently due in pensions or benefits as a result of this\u2014the money that\u2019s going towards the national debt is what\u2019s left over in NIC payments after this year\u2019s benefits and pensions have been paid. There\u2019s also no question of future pensions being unavailable as a result of this.\n\nThis is a long-running debate (the current law allowing this dates back to 1992). Arguments have been made for many years that the surplus would be better spent on increasing people\u2019s pensions, while Conservative, Coalition and Labour governments have argued that it\u2019s more prudent to keep the money in reserve and invest it in the meantime to help pay down the debt.\n\nThe UK\u2019s national debt is currently \u00a31,800 billion and every year the UK pays about \u00a340 billion in interest on that debt.\n\nNICs are paid by employees, employers and the self-employed in the UK and pay for contributory benefits, mainly the state pension. So for the most part, today\u2019s workers are paying the pensions of today\u2019s pensioners.\n\nUnlike most taxes in the UK, NICs are paid into a specific pot called the National Insurance Fund, rather than being put with the rest of the tax money collected for the Treasury.\n\nHuge sums of money flow into and out of this fund every year. In 2017/18, about \u00a3100 billion went in via NIC contributions and about \u00a3100 billion left the fund again to pay for benefits.\n\nBut the fund doesn\u2019t always end up in balance. In some years, it needs to pay out a little more in benefits than it gets in contributions\u2014a deficit. In other years, it pays out less than it receives\u2014meaning it\u2019s in surplus.\n\nWhen the fund is in surplus, that money is usually kept in the fund effectively as a reserve, to make sure there is enough money to pay for things like benefits and pensions in years when there\u2019s a deficit.\n\nBut the government doesn\u2019t just leave that reserve pot alone. It invests it in the UK\u2019s national debt, effectively reducing the debt.\n\nIn its response to a freedom of information request earlier this year the government said:\n\n\u201cThe latest National Insurance Fund Accounts show that the balance of the NIF increased by [\u00a32 billion] in 2017/18\u2026. This resulted in a closing balance of [\u00a324 billion], which was paid into the [National Insurance Fund] Investment Account and, in practice, used to reduce the national debt\u201d.\n\nThe House of Commons Library says in its briefing on National Insurance, \u201cSince 2007 the Fund has been invested in the Government\u2019s \u2018Call Notice Deposit Account\u2019, administered by the Debt Management Office\u2026 It is worth emphasizing that these funds are being held in this account on loan\u2026 there is no question of the Government being in a position to use this facility to extract money from the Fund as an extra source of revenue.\u201d\n\nIn practice, the money from National Insurance Contributions isn\u2019t really separate from general government funding\n\nEven though there\u2019s a specific pot of money for NI funds to flow into and out of, it\u2019s not helpful\u2014as the Insitute for Fiscal Studies has argued in the past\u2014 to think of this as a ring-fenced sum that\u2019s separate from the rest of the government\u2019s money.\n\nThat\u2019s because when the fund runs low (after, say, years of deficits in a row), the Treasury steps in and injects new money into the fund. And as mentioned above, the surpluses in the fund are also invested in the national debt.\n\nThat means, in practice, some money flows into the fund that doesn\u2019t come from NI contributions and some money flows out that doesn\u2019t go to pensions or contributory benefits.\n\nIn other words, whatever the amount of NI contributions the government raises in a given year, it always finds a way to pay the pensions and benefits it has to.\n\nSurpluses on National Insurance funds could soon be a thing of the past\n\nThe government can\u2019t know exactly how much NIC income it will get in any one year, nor how much in pensions and benefits it will need to pay out. One of the roles of the Government\u2019s Actuary is to help predict what will happen to the fund in future.\n\nAccording to a review in 2017, due largely to an ageing population and an increasing proportion of people claiming pensions, the fund isn\u2019t sustainable in the long-term through NI contributions alone. That means it could need top-up money from the Treasury to keep pensions and benefits in payment, and that will come from general taxation. There may also need to be bigger changes\u2014higher NI payments, lower pensions increases, and increases to the state pension age could all be factors.", "lang": "en"}
