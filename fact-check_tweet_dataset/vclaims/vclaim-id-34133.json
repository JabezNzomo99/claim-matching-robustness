The person in the image is indeed a student of JNU, but his name is not Moinuddin but Pankaj Mishra.\n\nAlt News contacted Pankaj Mishra who confirmed that the person in the photograph is him. He said, \u201cMy name is Pankaj Mishra and I am from Allahabad. I did my masters from Tata Institute of Social Sciences in 2016. After that I worked on public health in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. I am currently researching on public health in JNU. I enrolled in 2019. This is a recent photograph.\u201d Mishra told us his age is 30 years and not 47 years, and that the photograph was taken when Zee News reporters had visited JNU, and that Zee News had broadcast reports targeting JNU students, following which the students had then protested.\n\nWe found the Twitter account of Pankaj Mishra, wherein his picture matches with the viral photograph.\n\nEver since the protest by JNU students, several instances of misinformation targeting the university have been shared on social media. In another instance, random images of young women picked up from the internt have been shared with the false claim that they are students of JNU. Here, a 30-year old student\u2019s photo has been passed off as a 47-year old student named Moinuddin.", "lang": "en"}
