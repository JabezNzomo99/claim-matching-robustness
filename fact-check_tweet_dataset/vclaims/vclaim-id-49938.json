Vajpayee had arrived at the Parliament on a bullock cart in 1973 to protest rising prices of petrol and kerosene. At that time, Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nReverse-searching the image, we found another picture with the same elements from the archive of Hindustan Times.\n\nThe caption of the picture says, \"A 1973 photo of Atal Bihari Vajpayee arriving at Parliament House on a bullock cart to protest against the increase in petrol and kerosene prices.\"\n\nAt that time, Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister. Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister over a decade later, in 1984, after her assassination.\n\nThe \"bullock cart protest\" by Vajpayee was widely covered by the Indian media at that time. International publications such as The New York Times had also covered it.\n\nRajiv Gandhi is credited with computerisation in India. Searching for Vajpayee's stand on the same, we found two speeches wherein he had praised the move. These were his Independence Day speeches in 2002 and 2003.\n\nOn August 15, 2003, Vajpayee said in his speech, \"Lakhs of young Indians have got attractive employment in the field of computers. Sitting in our cities, they are providing services to hospitals, factories, and offices in various countries. Software exports have zoomed from Rs 8,000 crore to nearly Rs 50,000 crore.\"\n\nHence, it is clear that the viral picture of Atal Bihari Vajpayee is being shared on social media with a false claim. The picture was taken in 1973 when he'd arrived at Parliament on a bullock cart to protest rising prices of petrol, and not against Rajiv Gandhi's computerisation.", "lang": "en"}
