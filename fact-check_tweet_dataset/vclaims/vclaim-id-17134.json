In fact, it doesn\u2019t show Algeria\u2019s goalkeeper at all -- it\u2019s a doctored version of a photo of Ivory Coast player Boubacar Barry, and it was taken during training for the World Cup in Brazil back in 2014.\n\nOn Sunday, Algeria thrashed Kenya 2-0 in their Group C match, which was their opening into the AFCON tournament hosted in Egypt. The results were disheartening to football enthusiasts in Kenya.\n\nThe post, which we\u2019ve archived here, was published on June 23 on Group Kenya, a public Facebook group with more than two million followers. It racked up more than 3,000 reactions and comments.\n\nThe post suggests that the Kenyan team could never have won faced with the Spiderman-like skills of Algeria\u2019s goalkeeper Ra\u00efs M'Bolhi.\n\n\u201cI was happy about harambee stars until I saw this Algerian goalkeeper doing his training. Harambee stars, it was a wonderful tour, journey mercies as you come back home. Karibuni tuendelee kusambaza noti mpya (welcome back home, we continue circulating the new currency notes),\u201d the caption reads.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta announced this month that Kenya would be introducing new bank notes in a bid to fight corruption and money-laundering. Kenyans must return any 1,000-shilling notes by October 1.\n\nIn fact, a reverse image search on TinEye revealed that the image used in the Facebook post was taken back in 2014 -- and it does not show the Algerian goalkeeper at all.\n\nThe original photo was taken by AFP photographer Issouf Sanogo in Aguas de Lindoia, Brazil, during training for the FIFA World Cup. You can find it here on the AFP Forum website.\n\n\u201cIvory Coast's national football team goalkeeper Boubacar Barry stretches on the crossbar as he takes part in a team training session at Aguas de Lindoia on June 9, 2014, ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil,\u201d the caption reads.\n\nAs you can see from comparing the two photos, the one used in the Facebook post has been cropped and blurred. A ball has been added digitally to make the footballer\u2019s antics look even more impressive.\n\nSanogo confirmed that his photo had been manipulated. \u201cAbsolutely false -- there was no ball,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is Kenya's sixth appearance in the AFCON tournament, with the last one being in Tunisia in 2004.", "lang": "en"}
