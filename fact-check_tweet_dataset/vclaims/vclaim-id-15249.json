I speak the truth, my actions are true.)\u201d.\n\nThe clip is doing rounds on Twitter as well.\n\nIt is viral on social media, shared mostly by individual users.\n\nThe 10-second clip widely circulated on social media was picked up from prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s speech in Rajasthan after the Pulwama terror attack. \u201cPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday threw a challenge to his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan, asking him to act honourably by bringing to justice those responsible for the Pulwama terror attack,\u201d reported NDTVon February 23, 2019.\n\nIn the complete video, PM Modi does not call himself \u201cson of a Pathan\u201d, but attributes this statement to Pakistani PM Imran Khan. At around 1 minute into the video, he says, \u201c\u2026you (Imran Khan) have come from the world of sports. Come, India and Pakistan together will fight against poverty, illiteracy, disrespect \u2013 this is what I told him that day. And he told me, \u201cModiji main Pathan ka baccha hu, main saccha bolta hu aur saccha karta hu.\u201d Today we need to put to test these words spoken by the Pakistani prime minister.\u201d\n\nIn the clip viral of social media, the word \u201cModiji\u201d was edited out before the PM began the \u201cson of a Pathan\u201d statement, which gave viewers the impression that the prime minister was talking about himself. However, he claimed that the words were spoken by Pakistani PM Imran Khan. A similar piece of misinformation was earlier debunked about Rahul Gandhi\u2019s \u201caloo-sona machine\u201d remark. The statement was attributed to the Congress president, when, in fact, he claimed that the words were uttered by PM Modi.", "lang": "en"}
