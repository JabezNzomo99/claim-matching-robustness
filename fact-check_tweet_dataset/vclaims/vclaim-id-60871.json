On Oct. 24, 2013, Republican Gov. Scott Walker used his weekly to herald a $100 million property tax relief bill he into law four days earlier.\n\nAfter we heard the opening lines of the Democratic response, put out the same day, we weren\u2019t sure what to think.\n\n\"Last week, the Legislature passed Gov. Walker\u2019s so-called property tax relief bill,\" Ashland state Rep. said in her . \"Lost in all the hype is the fact that the governor and Republican-controlled Legislature are still raising your property taxes.\"\n\nSo, is the property tax relief real? Is it somehow superseded by property tax increases? And don\u2019t school districts and other local governments help determine how big your property tax bill is?\n\nWe\u2019ll start by reviewing how a property tax bill comes to be .\n\nEvery fall, each local unit of government -- cities, villages, towns, counties, school districts, and technical college districts -- adopts a budget for the following year. They subtract what they expect to receive in revenue, such as state aid, license fees, tuition, etc. The remainder has to come from property taxes, which happens to be the of tax revenue in Wisconsin.\n\nIn total, local governments levy of all property taxes; the state claims the last sliver, for forestry programs.\n\nNevertheless, state government plays an important role in how much your property tax bill turns out to be.\n\nFirst of all, the local governments\u2019 levies get reduced by three state tax credits, including the state lottery credit.\n\n, the state has imposed a variety of caps on how much money local governments can raise or spend. So, even though the locals are the ones levying property taxes, the state puts strict limits on how much they can levy.\n\nFor example, school districts are limited in the amount of money they can raise in total from property taxes and state aid. On the other hand, school districts can exceed their limits if voters approve a referendum. For municipalities and counties, their levy growth, if any, is limited to the amount of property taxes generated by new construction in their communities.\n\nReining in property taxes has been one of Walker\u2019s priorities as governor. On Oct. 10, 2013, citing growth in state tax revenue, he of the Legislature to take up property tax relief -- specifically by increasing state aid to school districts.\n\nSo, the approach was not a simple across-the-board tax reduction.\n\nThe property tax relief was approved overwhelmingly on bipartisan votes -- in the Assembly, with Bewley among the Democrats voting for it, and in the Senate. The law state aid payments to school districts by $40 million (0.92%) in 2013-\u201914 and $60 million (1.36%) in 2014-\u201915.\n\nBut, as we discussed earlier, school districts are under revenue limits. So, while individual levies for school districts will vary, statewide the additional $100 million in state aid to school districts a corresponding $100 million decrease in property taxes.\n\nState schools Superintendent Tony Evers that while the new law \"provides property tax relief for some school districts, it does not increase spending for public schools.\"\n\nNow, to Bewley\u2019s claim that Walker and the GOP-run Legislature are \"still raising your property taxes.\"\n\nIn her radio remarks, Bewley argued that despite the property tax relief, the average person\u2019s property taxes will rise.\n\nWhen we asked for evidence, her office cited an October 2013 from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It takes into account not only the property tax relief, but also the 2013-\u201915 state budget that Walker signed into law several months earlier.\n\nIn contrast to the property tax relief bill, the state was adopted without a single Democratic vote. It passed in the Assembly, with three Republicans voting no; then it passed in the Senate, with one Republican voting no.\n\nAccording to the fiscal bureau, the property tax for a median-valued home -- $151,148 -- was $2,943. Under the biennial state budget, the tax was to drop by $5 in the first year, then increase by $36 in the second. That put the tax bill on the typical home at $2,974 -- a net increase of $31 over the two years.\n\nBut with the property tax relief law, the tax on the typical home is now estimated to go down by $18 in the first year and increase $29 in the second. That would put the tax bill at $2,954 -- a net increase of $11.\n\nWalker spokesman Tom Evenson agreed with the figures, but noted that property tax increases have been held down under during Walker's first two years in office.\n\nHe cited an August 2013 that said total property taxes, not just the portion levied by school districts, rose by 0.2% in 2011-\u201912 and 0.8% in 2012-\u201913. That was the first time since at least 1946 that the total levy rose by less than 1% in two consecutive years, the report said.\n\nBewley said \"the Legislature passed Gov. Walker\u2019s so-called property tax relief bill,\" but the Republicans \"are still raising your property taxes.\"\n\nBewley\u2019s right that under the Republicans\u2019 2013-\u201915 state budget, it\u2019s estimated that property tax bills will rise, by an estimated $11 over two years for a typical home. But the increase would have been larger without the property tax relief, and property tax bills are affected by actions taken by local governments, not just the GOP-controlled state government.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Bewley a Half True.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "lang": "en"}
