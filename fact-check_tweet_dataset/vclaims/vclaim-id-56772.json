He said that the government has to slowly move towards the opening of the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNow, a video of a person complaining about lack of social distancing in a bus is being shared on social media. In the video, the man standing in a crowded bus asks who will be held accountable if they get infected. \u201cDM hoga..(incomprehensible)\u2026Kejriwal hoga? Is there any answer?\u201d he questions.\n\nBJP Delhi tweeted the video on May 19 taking a jibe at Delhi CM \u2014 \u201d Kejriwal, you said that you will make sure that there are not more than 20 people in a bus at a time. Why do you want to get [these] people killed, Chief Minister, give [us] the answer\u201d. The tweet has garnered more than 1,300 shares so far.\n\nWest Delhi BJP MP Parvesh Singh Sahib too tweeted the video and took potshots at the Delhi Chief Minister. \u201cArvind Kejriwal said that he will make sure that there will be only 20 people on the bus. Who will be responsible for this?\u201d wrote Parvesh Singh Sahib. It was retweeted more than 6,700 times.\n\nOn May 19, Congress leader Ajay Maken also posted the video with the message, \u201cResults were obvious today. Stranded passengers at DTC stops & the buses full.\u201d\n\nWe found a tweet by Delhi-based journalist Jatin Anand where he informed that the video was posted on DTC Karamchari Ekta Union\u2019s WhatsApp group on March 27, 2020.\n\nBased on the information, we contacted a member of the WhatsApp group. The member who did not wish to be named sent us a video recording of a conversation on WhatsApp group \u2013 DTC Karamchari Media Group \u2013 to confirm that the video was posted on March 27, 2020. In the video posted below, one can see that the timestamp of the video says it was sent on the group at 9:04 PM on March 27.\n\nA screenshot from the WhatsApp group can be seen below.\n\nWe then spoke to the President of DTC Karamchari Ekta Union Manoj Sharma. In a conversation with Alt News, Sharma said, \u201cThe man in the video is a Delhi Civil Defence personnel and the people in the video are migrants who are being transported to Anand Vihar ISBT. The video is from March.\u201d\n\nThus, it is certain that the video of a Delhi Civil Defence personnel complaining about the lack of social distancing in a bus in Delhi is close to two months old and unrelated to the recent announcement by the Delhi government to ease the lockdown.\n\nHowever, a video of passengers standing outside a bus and clearly flouting social distancing norms at Sultanpuri Bus Terminal has emerged on social media. On May 20, Delhi\u2019s transport minister Kailash Gehlot said that strict action will be taken against bus marshals, drivers and conductors of DTC if they fail to implement the rules of social distancing and other safety norms in buses.", "lang": "en"}
