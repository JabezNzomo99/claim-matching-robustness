China did it, after all, and Trump\u2019s wall will only be a fraction of what the Chinese built, he frequently explains. And the Chinese didn\u2019t even have the building materials we do now!\n\nTrump keeps making the comparison anyway, and he has done so since early on his campaign, joking that he would name the wall the \u201cGreat Wall of Trump.\u201d And he insists on a questionable estimate for the cost of his wall, which we have debunked. Let\u2019s look at the facts.\n\nPlus, it wasn\u2019t an effective security barrier. As our colleague Ishaan Tharoor of WorldViews wrote: \u201cThe Great Wall of China, for all its majesty, was very porous. While a towering monument to Chinese civilization, it was hardly impregnable. The Mongols, Manchus and others all breached this great defense and went on to establish their dominion behind its ramparts. Perhaps that\u2019s the best way for Trump to understand the Great Wall\u2019s significance \u2014 not as a security barrier, but as a work of political propaganda.\u201d\n\nFor major government projects, $10 billion is not a huge sum. The cost of 1,000 miles of fences \u2014 not even a concrete wall \u2014 is at least $3 billion. That\u2019s not even including the upkeep and maintenance. The Corps of Engineers estimated that the 25-year life cycle cost of the fence would range from $16.4 million to $70 million per mile; the total cost of the fencing so far has been $7 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nA concrete wall would cost much more than that. We updated calculations done by a structural engineer in an article in The National Memo and found raw materials alone would cost $2 billion. A retired estimator and economist for one of the nation\u2019s largest construction firms worked through some of the math and said a wall of this type would cost at least $25 billion. That\u2019s not even counting the video system to keep watch on the border.\n\nThe focus on building a wall overlooks many of the other reasons that have led to the number of unauthorized migrants in the country, experts say. Walls are not impregnable \u2014 as shown in the example of the Great Wall of China \u2014 and simply putting more of it up doesn\u2019t help. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with symptoms. You\u2019ve really got to look at the deeper issue of immigrant labor that our economy uses,\u201d said Nestor Rodriguez, a University of Texas at Austin professor and immigration researcher.\n\nUnless Trump is running to be the emperor of the United States and plans to build a series of fortresses, walls and trenches that will be added on to for dynasties to come beyond a Trump Dynasty, he should really drop this nonsense assertion. It is an apples-to-oranges comparison that shows the Republican front-runner\u2019s lack of understanding of the history behind the Great Wall of China, which was built over many millennia to meet a variety of commerce and defensive needs of certain dynasties. And as a security measure, it was not an effective barrier.\n\nMoreover, Trump continues to assert a questionable estimate for his wall that is much lower than experts have calculated. As we\u2019ve said before, we welcome a serious discussion of costs and benefits of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, rather than wild rhetoric. We contemplated awarding Four Pinocchios, as neither his comparison to China nor the wall estimate is rooted in any factual basis. We\u2019ll spare him a Pinocchio and give him credit for using the updated length of the Great Wall of China. It\u2019s refreshing that he apparently bothered to look up an up-to-date factoid.", "lang": "en"}
