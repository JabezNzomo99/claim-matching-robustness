The plans show that Prigozhin\u2019s circle has sought to exploit racial tensions well beyond Russia\u2019s social media and misinformation efforts tied to the 2016 election,\u201d NBC reported.\n\nThe plans, according to NBC, included a blueprint, entitled \u201cDevelopment Strategy of a Pan-African State on U.S. Territory,\u201d which floated the idea of enlisting poor, formerly incarcerated African Americans \u201cwho have experience in organized crime groups\u201d as well as members of \u201cradical black movements for participation in civil disobedience actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe infrastructure for this project is already prepared. The American society is not immune to this project. The objective is to stage a certain number of interracial clashes with a good TV footage, which later will be sold to the Russian public, as well as to the American, European, etc.,\u201d Khodorkovsky said later in an interview to the Voice of America Russian Service.\n\nKhodorkovsky said, \u201cdesigning\u201d such conflicts \u201cartificially with the kind of technology and money available to the team working under the brand of Mr. Prigozhin is quite realistic.\u201d\n\nIn his Facebook posting, the subject of this fact check, Khodorkovsky said Prigozhin's efforts in the U.S., Ukraine, Syria, Africa and elsewhere \"are not just plans but reality.\"\n\nPolygraph.info finds the claim is likely to be true based on the following facts:\n\nIn February 2018, the U.S. Justice Department indictment against Yevgeny Prigozhin, companies controlled by him and persons employed by his companies alleged that Prigozhin engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. by \u201cimpairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful function of the government through fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes.\u201d\n\nThe indictment alleged that these organizations received funding for their operations from Yevgeny Prigozhin and the companies he controlled, and that he spent \u201csignificant funds\u201d to further their operations.\n\nThe Internet Research Agency (IRA) employed \u201chundreds of individuals for its online operations\u201d and its annual budget totaled the \u201cequivalent of millions of U.S. dollars,\u201d the document said.\n\nA former IRA employee Lyudmila Savchuk, who said she \u201cinfiltrated\u201d the place to \u201cexpose\u201d its disinformation activities told Polygraph.info that \u201cthousands\u201d worked at the troll factory on shifts 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Savchuk\u2019s account confirmed the allegations from the U.S. indictment that the IRA operators had been assuming or stealing identities of U.S. persons or creating false identities.\n\n\u200b\u201cA job at the troll factory offers people an opportunity to live the life of their dreams: in virtual reality, they can become anybody they want to be,\u201d Savchuk told Polygraph.info. \u201cSome start living the identities they have assumed in order to perform their trolling tasks, and some start believing the lies they have been tasked to create.\u201d\n\nThe verifiable information published by multiple sources about Prigozhin\u2019s firms and companies also confirms Khodorkovsky\u2019s assessment of their technical capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. indictment, for instance, outlines a sophisticated and well-resourced organization, stating that the IRA is \u201corganized into departments, including: a graphics department; a data analysis department; a search-engine optimization department; an information-technology department to maintain the digital infrastructure used in the operations\u2026\u201d\n\nSince the release by the U.S of incriminating information about Yevgeny Prigozhin, there has been no sign that the Russian government is curtailing his companies\u2019 operations or shrinking them. To the contrary \u2013 the troll factory has moved into a new much more expensive office building and expanded its networks, many of its creations posing as authentic media outlets, Prigozhin\u2019s footprints had been reported in Russia\u2019s hybrid wars and shadow operations from Ukraine to Syria, to Africa, to Venezuela, and he allegedly keeps his contracts with the Kremlin.\n\nFinally, Khodorkovsky\u2019s statement that Moscow\u2019s goal may be to sew a racial discord is also likely to be true as based on data provided to the U.S. Congress by Facebook.\n\nAccording to Facebook, more than 3,000 ads addressing social and political issues targeting U.S. audiences between 2015 and 2017 appear to have come from accounts associated with a Russian entity known as the Internet Research Agency.\n\n\u201cAn estimated 10 million people in the U.S. saw the ads,\u201d purchased by the Russians for their influence campaign, Facebook said. \u201cMost of the ads appear to focus on divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\u201d\n\nAn Oxford University study of the IRA\u2019s activities in the U.S. from 2012 to 2018 showed \u201ca sustained effort to manipulate the U.S. public\u201d throughout that period, pointing to even higher audience engagement than the Mueller investigation established \u2013 more than 70 million reactions on Facebook alone during that time.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, these campaigns did not stop once Russia's IRA was caught interfering in the 2016 election,\u201d the report \u201cThe IRA, Social Media and Political Polarization in the United States,\u201d said. \u201cEngagement rates increased and covered a widening range of public policy issues, national security issues, and issues pertinent to younger voters.\u201d The University used data provided by social media companies to a U.S. congressional committee.\n\n\u201cSome of the most divisive ads capitalized on the political movement Black Lives Matter and hot-button political issues including immigration, gun control, the religion of Islam and LGBT-centric topics. The ads also promoted events organized by Americans who were unaware their political rallies and protests were being fueled by a Russian disinformation campaign,\u201d NBC reported on the matter.", "lang": "en"}
