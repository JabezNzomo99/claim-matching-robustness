Likewise, we have found no evidence of Facebook\u2019s engaging in a systematic removal or prohibition of the posting of the Lord\u2019s Prayer on their network.\n\nMore on point, however, Facebook\u2019s community standards in general, and the platform\u2019s objectionable content policies in particular, make no mention of prohibiting the posting of the Lord\u2019s Prayer or other forms of religious expression. (Only hate speech directed at a person\u2019s religious affiliation is disallowed under Facebook\u2019s standards.)", "lang": "en"}
