This is false; AFP found that the video does show an attack on a Nigerian embassy, but it was in Dakar, Senegal in 2013 -- not Cotonou, Benin in 2019.\n\nOne version of the video, shared more than 4,800 times on Facebook, and seen by over 93,000 people, is captioned: \u201cBeninours attack Nigeria embassy in Benin republic over border closure by Nigerian government\u201d. The same claim and video was also shared on YouTube. This video, seen nearly 2,000 times, claims to show the \u201cNigerian Embassy under attack in Benin Republic over border closure\u201d.\n\nThe same video was shared by other Facebook users, also claiming to show an attack on the Nigerian embassy in Cotonou in Benin Republic. We archived some of those videos here, here, here, and here.\n\nThe Nigerian government announced a partial closure of its land borders in August 2019 in a bid to halt smuggling of rice, petrol, and other goods. The closure affects Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger.\n\nAs reported by AFP, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s office said the restrictions on cross-border trade would \"allow Nigeria\u2019s security forces to develop a strategy\" to combat smuggling, which it called a \"dangerous trend\".\n\nAFP also reported that the move has especially affected Benin, and cast a shadow over the newly-signed Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement which aims to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers in the region.\n\nDoes the video show an attack on the Nigerian embassy in Benin?\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ambassador to the Republic of Benin, Kayode Oguntuase, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in a statement that there had been no attack at the Nigerian embassy in Cotonou.\n\n\u201cThe embassy of Nigeria in Cotonou was never attacked and the embassy is not under any form of attack,\u201d he said, adding that his office had been \"inundated with telephone calls\" about the alleged attack.\n\nWe analysed the video with the INVID verification tool and found that it had been uploaded to a Facebook page created only in April 2019 called Nicepec. The page had uploaded the video on October 2, 2019 -- showing that it had been shot earlier than when it began circulating in Nigeria from October 12, 2019.\n\nWe searched Google for frames of the video and found a few YouTube videos dating from more than four years ago.\n\nThe earliest version of the video was from March 2013. The video shows an attack on the Nigerian embassy in Dakar. It was reported in the local media in Nigeria at the time, and discussed in the Nigerian house of representatives in Abuja.\n\nKatyen Jackden, the Nigerian ambassador to Senegal at the time, said the attack on the embassy followed a killing and the disappearance of a body from a morgue in Senegal.", "lang": "en"}
