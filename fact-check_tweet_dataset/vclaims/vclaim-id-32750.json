The video accompanying the claim was cut from the live video posted by the \"It's Showtime\" Facebook page.\n\nThe cut video started with a dialogue between one person who said, \"Ilan ang viewers mo (How many viewers do you have)?\" and another responding \"9k (9,000).\" Afterward, the person holding the camera said \"Naka-10k na ako! (I got 10,000 already!)\" and another responded, \"Ako na magla-live, exposure 'yan, sampung libo 'yan eh (I'll be the one to livestream, that's exposure, that's 10,000).\"\n\nThe \"It's Showtime\" Facebook page posted the original video during the protest against the possible ABS-CBN shutdown held last Friday. (LOOK: Stars rally in support of ABS-CBN franchise renewal)\n\nIn the original video, the dialogue was shortly followed by Showtime Bidaman finalist Eris Aragoza saying, \"Hello sa 11k viewers (Hello to the 11,000 viewers).\" As of Tuesday, the original video had acquired 1.3 million views.\n\nABS-CBN is facing a quo warranto petition filed by Solicitor General Jose Calida with the Supreme Court for alleged violations of franchise terms. However, the Senate committee on public services' hearing on Monday, February 24, revealed that ABS-CBN did not breach any laws and franchise terms.\n\nABS-CBN's franchise is set to end on May 4. While Congress has yet to approve any bills that would renew the network's franchise, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said Congress may opt to authorize the National Telecommunications Commission to grant a provisional permit so that ABS-CBN may continue operations even after its franchise lapses. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
