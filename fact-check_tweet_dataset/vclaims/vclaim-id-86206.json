Good Jobs Nation has promoted its study with tweets similar to the one above, labeling Trump as \u201cOffshorer-in-chief.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department has a program known as Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), originally enacted in the 1960s to assist workers whose jobs were displaced by free trade agreements. Faraday studied the jobs certified as being shipped to another country and then crosschecked with data on federal contract awards posted on usaspending.gov. (Correction: an earlier version of this article said TAA dated to the enactment of North American Free Trade Agreement; there was a related program called the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program.)\n\nHe concluded that, as of June 8, major contractors had earned $52 billion contracts and had shipped more than 13,000 jobs offshore. Most of the list consists of 12 companies that received about $48 billion in contracts, with the biggest job losers led by General Motors, Boeing, United Technologies and Siemens.\n\nThe overall numbers add up in the report and a spot check of the data indicates it is sound. (We have questions about the yearly rate data, putting Trump at a disadvantage, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of this fact check.)\n\nWe had noted before that data from the Reshoring Initiative shows that companies started to return jobs to the United States \u2014 or other countries invested in the United States \u2014 during the Obama administration, but the trend really started to pick up in 2017. About 73,000 jobs were brought to the United States in 2015, 113,000 in 2016 and 171,000 in 2017, Trump\u2019s first year in office. That\u2019s a gain of more than 50 percent between 2016 and 2017.\n\nLooking at the TAA numbers, one sees a similar decline in workers who were certified as having lost jobs because they were shipped overseas. We calculated there were 126,165 lost in 2016, Obama\u2019s last year in office, and then 85,482 lost in 2017 and 78,514 lost in 2018. Obama had two better years, in 2014 and 2015, but otherwise overall losses were higher in every other year of his administration \u2014 including 214,125 in 2010 and 244,617 in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting point,\u201d acknowledged Faraday, but he said the group was focused on the losses, not the gains. \u201cWe\u2019re labor, and that how\u2019s we see the world.\u201d He said it was important that the jobs be returned to the communities that had lost them.\n\nFaraday noted that the focus of the report was on companies that benefited from U.S. contracts. He said that Trump could have taken action, via an executive order, to punish companies that shipped jobs overseas but that the president had failed to do so. The top executives of five companies that had offshored jobs, according to the TAA data, were members of Trump\u2019s American Manufacturing Council, which the president later disbanded.\n\nStill, a number of companies on the list have also said they will bring jobs back from overseas or add jobs in the United States, according to news reports. AT&T, for instance, is listed in Faraday\u2019s report as offshoring 270 jobs since Trump became president. Yet in 2017, the company announced an agreement with the Communications Workers of America to bring back 3,000 jobs that had been sent to Mexico. (The CWA, in a report in January, charged that the company has continued to close call centers in the United States and lay off workers.) \u201cAT&T is abiding by our agreement for hiring in the Southwest, but still continues laying off workers and offshoring throughout the company,\u201d said Beth Allen, a CWA spokeswoman.\n\nAs regular readers know, context is important. If the glass is half full, you can\u2019t look at only the empty part. A more balanced presentation in the report would include the jobs that have been returned from overseas, not just the ones that are lost.", "lang": "en"}
