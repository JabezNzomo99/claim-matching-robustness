It was also spotted through Facebook's Claim Check dashboard.\n\nThe facts: At the time this claim was spread, the \"98%\" rating was not in the latest major nationwide surveys measuring Filipinos' trust in the President.\n\nThe Social Weather Stations (SWS) and Pulse Asia conduct surveys on Filipinos' approval and trust ratings for the President every quarter. The last available surveys for both firms were conducted in December 2019, and the next will be in March 2020.\n\nThere is no SWS or Pulse Asia survey as of February 11 that reflects the supposed \"98%\" rating. In addition, the Facebook post did not cite its source for the ratings on its graphic card.\n\nAlso, as of this writing and at the time the claim was shared, ABS-CBN is still operating. But it is facing roadblocks in the renewal of its franchise in Congress, as well as a quo warranto petition filed by Solicitor General Jose Calida with the Supreme Court. (READ: EXPLAINER: Legal points in Calida's quo warranto vs ABS-CBN)\n\nRappler has previously fact-checked content by Facebook page Blessed Be Philippines. In October 2019, it falsely claimed that there were \"no poor Filipinos\" during the regime of Ferdinand Marcos and that the \"real poverty\" happened during the terms of Corazon Aquino and Benigno Aquino III.", "lang": "en"}
