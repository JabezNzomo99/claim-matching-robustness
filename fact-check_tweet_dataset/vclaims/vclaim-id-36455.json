The claim is false; the video has circulated online in media reports since at least 2018 about an incident in Kashmir.\n\nThe one-minute 15-second video was published in this Facebook post on August 18, 2019. It has been viewed more than 19,000 times.\n\nThe English caption states: \u201cThis is a latest video(16th August) of Jammu & Kashmir,suburbs of Srinagar where Indian Army used 4 detained Kashmiri boys as human shield to \u201cdefeat\u201d some stone pelters some boys in jeans raising anti India slogans and brave soldiers abusing them saying \u201cthrow stones now\u201d.\"\n\nIn the video, a man can be heard speaking in Urdu. His comments translate to English as: \u201cLook at these cheat Indians, they have put our people in front so that we cannot throw stones. Look at these cowards, cowardly tribe. They have been picked up from their homes and kept in front of their vehicles so that no one throws stones. Leave, or we will force you to leave this land.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nIn early August, the Indian government stripped the part of Kashmir it administers of its semi-autonomous status.
