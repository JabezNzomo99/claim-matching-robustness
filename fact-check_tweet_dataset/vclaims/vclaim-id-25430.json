Instead this case is examined in the context of supporting and upholding EU sanctions,\u201d the Latvian Foreign Ministry said.\n\nThe ministry specified that its decision was part of Latvia\u2019s implementation of EU sanctions against Dmitry Kiselyov, the CEO of MIA Rossiya Segodnya.\n\nKiselyov was included on the EU sanctions list in 2014 as a \u201ccentral figure of the government propaganda supporting the deployment of Russian forces in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe Latvian Foreign Ministry told Polygraph.info that the EU restrictions against Kiselyov \u201capply also to baltnews.lv, which can be regarded as an economic resource held by a legal person upon which European Union restrictive measures have been imposed and must be upheld.\u201d\n\nMIA Rossiya Segodnya\u2019s \u201cAbout us\u201d page says the agency was founded in 1929 in the Soviet Union as Radio Comintern.\n\nAccording to the GlobalSecurity.org website, the Soviet Union\u2019s Comintern (a byname for \u201cThe Communist International\u201d) was a \u201cweapon such as no other country possessed, and the Soviet Union never hesitated to use it when the occasion demanded.\u201d\n\nThe Comintern\u2019s tools and actions \u201cincluded pressure groups to influence other countries\u2019 foreign policy in favor of the Soviet Union; attempts to obtain control of the labor movement in other countries, especially key industries such as shipping and radio; enlistment of communists abroad for espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union against their own or other countries,\u201d GlobalSecurity.org stated.\n\nDecades after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, the objectives of MIA Rossiya Segodnya differ little from those of its predecessor, Radio Comintern, Paul Goble, a former U.S. government adviser on Eurasian affairs and an expert on Soviet Union and Russia, told Polygraph.info.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s statement \u201cis not only false, but intended to deceive,\u201d Goble said. \u201cMoscow-controlled media have worked hard to divide Latvia and undermine its democracy. Latvia is only taking reasonable steps to prevent the Russian side from achieving its goals.\u201d\n\nBaltnews.lv was part of a clandestine influence operation Moscow launched in the three Baltic states in 2014, immediately after the Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, an in-depth investigation by the Latvian portal Re:Baltica found.\n\nPresenting itself as an \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cnon-political\u201d media outlet with a focus on cultural and social topics, Baltnews used specific domain suffixes for each of the Baltic countries -- \u201c.lv\u201d for Latvia, \u201c.ee\u201d for Estonia and \u201c.lt\u201d for Lithuania \u2013 and employed a complex domain registration scheme to cover up its true origins and the identity of its owner.\n\nAs shown by the Whois.net report cited above, the Baltnews domains have been registered in the Netherlands to a company called Ascio Technologies Inc. That company was also masked under the umbrella of a \u201cEuropean\u201d firm called Media Capital Holding B.V.\n\nMIA Rossiya Segodnya admitted owning the Baltnews project only after Latvian investigative reporters untied all the knots and revealed its true identity.\n\nThe Asymmetric Operations Working Group, part of the American Security Project of the Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Applied Physics Laboratory, stated in an unclassified report assessing Russia\u2019s hybrid warfare in the Baltic States that \u201cin regards with the information environment the Baltic States share much with Crimea.\u201d\n\n\u201cConcerns of Russian hybrid warfare may be warranted, whether short or long term, Russian media present a threat not only by spreading inaccurate information and the resulting biased viewpoints but also by calling into question the trustworthiness of all media,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, in a July 2019 report stated that NATO remains the main target, \u201cthe heart\u201d of Russia\u2019s hybrid warfare in the Baltic States.\n\n\u201cThe actual expansion of NATO to include the three Baltic States as well as Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 2004 was likely a tipping point in Putin\u2019s attitudes. The critical nuance to consider is that Putin has always been more concerned about the loss of control over Russia\u2019s perceived sphere of influence than an actual NATO threat to Russia,\u201d the report said.", "lang": "en"}
