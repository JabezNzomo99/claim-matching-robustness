The first case of rioting happened in Vadavali village where 2 people died, many got injured and many houses belonging to those of minority community were burnt/razed. Another case of rioting happened in Savarkundla town in Amreli district. With the communal tensions increasing, now wall writings with Love Jihad slogans have popped up in many places in Ahmedabad. These slogans were reportedly put up either late night on 1st April or early hours of 2nd April.\n\nThe slogan is written in Gujarati and it says \u201cLove Jihad thi savdhaan\u201d which essentially means \u201cBe cautious of Love Jihad\u201d. These wall-writings were found in multiple places in Ahmedabad including University area, Usmanpura Underbridge , Navgujarat college, Aroma college, Gujarat Congress Headquarters and Stadium road.\n\nWith Chattisgarh CM Raman Singh saying \u201cwill hang those who kill cows\u201d, Gujarat passing a law where the punishment for cow slaughter is life imprisonment and Yogi Adityanath becoming the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, there seems to be a definite push for increased communal polarisation across India.", "lang": "en"}
