The accompanying message, \u201cThe Leader of Our Country,\u201d was an attempt to show how Obama\u2019s supposed juvenile sense of humor made him unfit to be President:\n\nThe photograph, however, was a digitally altered fake. The real image, taken near Exit Glacier in Alaska, was posted to the White House Instagram account on 2 September 2015 and showed President Obama posing next to a sign indicating where the boundary of the now much-receded glacier was in 1961 (coincidentally also the year of President Obama\u2019s birth):\n\nMarkers throughout Exit Glacier show how much it\u2019s receded over time. The impacts of climate change are real, and the people of Alaska are living with them every day. It\u2019s never been more important for us to work together to address this challenge.\n\nOther variations of this image have also made their way around the Internet, including one which purportedly showed President Obama posing next to a 420 mile marker:\n\nThe number 420, of course, is associated with smoking marijuana.", "lang": "en"}
