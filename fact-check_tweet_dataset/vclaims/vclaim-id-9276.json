In the early hours of Monday morning \u2013 UK time \u2013 the Olympic flag was handed over from Rio to Tokyo, ready for the 2020 Games.\n\nWas this the UK\u2019s best overseas Olympics ever?\n\nExcluding Olympics which took place in London, Team GB won more medals and more golds in Rio than at any other Olympic games since they were founded in 1896.\n\nThat said, the number of events has increased over the years too. In 1896, at the first modern Olympics, there were 43 events. In Atlanta 20 years ago there were 271, and by 2016 in Rio there were 306.\n\nThe closest that the UK\u2019s athletes have ever got to matching this total overseas was at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, with 47 medals including nine golds.\n\nThe UK has hosted the Olympics three times, each time in London (1908, 1948 and 2012). British athletes won more medals in 1908 and more gold medals in 2012 than they have in Rio, but these are the only occasions this has happened.\n\nIn 1908 we won 146 medals, of which 56 were gold. In 2012 it was 65 medals including 29 golds.\n\nHas the UK ever finished above China in the medals table?\n\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China first officially competed at a Winter Olympics in 1980 and at a Summer Olympics in 1984.\n\nSince then, the UK has never been above China in the official medal table. The closest we ever came was at the 1988 Seoul Olympics when both countries won five gold medals each. China got more medals overall, though, with 28 to the UK\u2019s 24.\n\nIn 2016 the UK came second in the medal table, behind the USA and ahead of China for the first time.\n\nIn what sports has the UK won the most medals over the years?\n\nAthletes representing the United Kingdom have won 864 medals since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Almost a quarter of them have been in athletics. Between 1896 and the end of the Rio Games, British athletics representatives had achieved over 200 medals and 55 golds.\n\nIn 2016 this included races like the 5000m and the 4x400m relay, as well as the heptathlon, hammer throw and long jump.\n\nJust counting gold medals, our next most decorated Olympic sports are rowing (32), sailing (27), track cycling (24) and swimming (21). Counting all medals, boxing would make the top five instead of cycling.\n\nThe historic pattern holds true for Rio: Team GB won multiple gold medals in athletics, rowing, sailing and cycling, as well as equestrian and artistic gymnastics.\n\nSome sports have been included in the Olympics much longer than others. Sports such as swimming, rowing and boxing have all been included since some of the earliest games of the modern Olympics.\n\nBut judo, for example, was introduced first in 1964, and women\u2019s judo only in 1992. Rugby had been included in the earliest Olympics, but was not seen between 1924 and 2016. Rugby sevens made its return at the Rio games.\n\nDifferent sports also have different numbers of medals on offer. At the Rio Games, for example, there were 47 different athletics events and 36 swimming events. In contrast, sports like golf, water polo and BMX cycling only had two events.\n\nHow much funding does Team GB have?\n\nUK Sport committed \u00a3274 million specifically to Olympic sports and almost \u00a373 million to Paralympics sports over four years. This money comes from the government and from the National Lottery. It\u2019s then allocated by UK Sport to sporting organisations and to Olympic and Paralympic athletes.\n\n\u00a34.5 million per medal would have been correct for the London Olympics (\u00a3264 million, 65 medals), if you don\u2019t count the money spent on sports where no medal was won. The equivalent figure for 2016 was almost \u00a35.1 million.\n\nRowing, cycling and athletics received the most funding. Tennis, golf and rugby sevens are not funded by UK Sport, but were included in the sports targeted for medals.\n\nUK Sport has been provided funding for sports across the UK since 1997. In the run-up to the Sydney Olympics in 2000, it spent around \u00a369 million. Funding has kept increasing ever since.\n\nMost of the money paid out by UK Sport goes to the \u2018National Governing Bodies\u2019 of sports, so that they can arrange training and support staff, or directly to individual athletes.\n\nThis money for the athletes comes directly from the National Lottery and can be up to \u00a328,000 a year if that athlete is a medallist at the Olympics or other World Championships.\n\nThe British Olympic Association , which selects and organises the team, receives no money from the lottery or the government. It\u2019s all privately funded.\n\nTeam GB is the brand name adopted by the British Olympic Association.\n\nBut rather than just representing Great Britain \u2013 England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 the team includes athletes from the fourth country within the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, as well as the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and the UK Overseas Territories.\n\nThe name \u2018Team GB\u2019 doesn\u2019t cover all of these groups. \u2018Team UK\u2019 would be more accurate, but it still wouldn\u2019t describe everyone in the team.\n\nThe British Olympic Association gives two main reasons for the choice, aside from the fact that both GB and UK are imperfect descriptions. It says that the International Olympic Association has always recognised the team as \u2018GBR\u2019 or Great Britain, and \u2018Team GB\u2019 is a stronger brand when it comes to fundraising.\n\nIs there an age limit for competing in the Olympics?\n\nThis is right. The Olympic Charter, which sets the rules for the Games, says there is no specific age limit for competing in the Olympics. It depends on the rules laid down by the global governing body for each sport.\n\nFor example, the International Gymnastics Federation says that all gymnasts must either have been born before the end of 1998 or 2000 to compete in Rio, depending on the event or their gender.\n\nIn tennis, the rules say that all competitors must be 14 years old by the time of the Olympics.\n\nTo compete in cycling events athletes must either be 18 to compete in track and BMX events or 19 years old to compete in the road and mountain bike events.\n\nWhat kind of schools do Olympians go to?\n\n32% of Team GB\u2019s 130 Rio medal winners went to private schools, according to social mobility think tank, the Sutton Trust.\n\n60% of medal winners went to comprehensive schools and 8% went to grammar schools.\n\nThis trend varies widely depending on which sport you look at. 92% of the medal winners on the cycling team went to comprehensive or grammar schools, compared to 48% of the medal winners on the rowing team.\n\nThe proportion of UK medal winners who went to private school has decreased since the London 2012 Olympics. Four years ago 36% of medal winners went to private schools and 56% went to comprehensive schools.\n\nBut the Sutton Trust also pointed out that the number of UK athletes at the Olympics who went to private schools, including those who didn\u2019t win medals, has increased since 2012, from 20% to 28%.\n\nAs of January 2015, roughly 7% of English school students attended private schools.\n\nWe updated this piece to include information about the kind of schools Olympians go to.", "lang": "en"}
