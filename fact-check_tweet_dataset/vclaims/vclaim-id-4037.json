There are several inquiries about possible collusion among the questions published by the New York Times.\n\nOn April 30, the Times reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had \u201cat least four dozen questions on an exhaustive array of subjects he wants to ask President Trump to learn more about his ties to Russia and determine whether he obstructed the inquiry itself.\u201d The Times published the list and said it came out of discussions between Trump\u2019s lawyers and the special counsel\u2019s office, which has sought to question the president.\n\nThe next morning, Trump said on Twitter that it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the questions were \u201cleaked,\u201d adding that there were none on \u201ccollusion,\u201d which he called \u201ca made up, phony crime.\u201d\n\nBut there are several questions in the published list about possible collusion. The Times divided the list into four categories, related to: former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and campaign coordination with Russia.

(Russian pop star and his father were involved in setting up the Trump Tower meeting.)\n\u2022 What knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign, including by Paul Manafort, to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign?\n\u2022 What did you know about communication between Roger Stone, his associates, Julian Assange or WikiLeaks? (Stone, a friend and an informal adviser to Trump, said in Aug. 8, 2016, remarks to the Southwest Broward Republican Organization that he had \u201ccommunicated with Assange,\u201d referring to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.)\n\u2022 What do you know about a 2017 meeting in Seychelles involving Erik Prince?
