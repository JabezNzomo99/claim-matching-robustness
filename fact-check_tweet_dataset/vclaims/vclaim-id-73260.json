(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe\u2019ve checked a similar claim before. In late January, an article posted to Facebook claimed that Trump had signed a bill \"to clean millions of tons of garbage from the world\u2019s oceans.\"\n\nThe story was referring to the Save Our Seas Act of 2018, which Trump signed on Oct. 11. He then said that more than 8 million tons of garbage is dumped into oceans every year and that the law \"will help address this problem.\"\n\nBut Jordana Merran, communications manager for Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit that supported the Save Our Seas Act and celebrated its passage, said it\u2019s not accurate to summarize the legislation as a bill to \"clean millions of tons of garbage from the world\u2019s oceans.\"\n\nRather, the law Trump signed reauthorizes \"the longstanding amount of $10 million annually\" for NOAA\u2019s Marine Debris Program, she said.\n\n\"The program does support, among other efforts, Ocean Conservancy\u2019s International Coastal Cleanup, in which volunteers collect millions of pounds of garbage off beaches and waterways annually across the globe. However, many entities provide financial support for the ICC.\"\n\nThe legislation, which was sponsored by U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and cosponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, had bipartisan support. It doesn\u2019t direct the country to clean millions of tons of garbage from marine environments.\n\nThe bill reauthorizes and amends the Marine Debris Act \"to promote international action to reduce marine debris, and for other purposes,\" according to the law. But it\u2019s not specific about how much debris, or how it should be cleaned up.\n\nDid Trump sign another bill earlier in March?\n\n\"No,\" said Madeline Black, a communications assistant for Ocean Conservancy. \"This likely is the same claim as in February being shared belatedly.\"\n\nWhen we reviewed the original claim about this legislation, we rated it Half True. That\u2019s because Trump signed a bill that reauthorized a program aimed in part at removing marine water debris.\n\nThis more recent Facebook post makes a similar claim but it goes on step further, wrongly stating that Trump signed the legislation this month.\n\nWe rate this one as False.", "lang": "en"}
