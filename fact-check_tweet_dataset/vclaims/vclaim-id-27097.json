The viral photo claims that the man is the brother of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nAmong many users, Facebook user Neelam Chaturvedi Vidhayak posted the photo with a Hindi caption, \"Uttar Pradesh ke mukhyamantri aadarniya Yogi ji ke bhai hain jo chai ki dukan chala rahe hain, Congress ke koi bhi bade neta ka bhai is tarah ka ho to jaroor post kijiyega.\"\n\nIndia Today Fact Check found that the man in the viral photo is not the brother of CM Yogi Adityanath. This photo has been already shared by more than 11,000 people at the time of filing this story.\n\nFor the verification of the image, India Today reached out to Yogi's sister Shashi Singh. On the behalf of Shashi, her husband Puran Payal told us that the man in the photo is neither the brother of Yogi nor any family member. He also confirmed that none of Yogi's brother runs a tea shop. Yogi has three brothers and three sisters.\n\nWhen we searched about the family of Yogi Adityanath, we found a family interview done by ABP News back in March, 2017, when Yogi was elected the CM of Uttar Pradesh. Two of his brothers can be seen in this interview, whereas his third brother is working in Indian Army.\n\nMany prominent media houses had reported the story of Shailendra Mohan including India Today. It can be clearly seen that the photo of the man in the viral post doesn't match with any of Yogi's brother.\n\nWe couldn't find the identity of the man in the photo but it is established that he is not the brother of CM Yogi Adityanath. However, the man in the photo has a striking resemblance with CM Yogi.", "lang": "en"}
