This claim is misleading and misrepresents Biden\u2019s remarks.\n\nOne example of the claim, shared over 154,000 times since July 23 is visible here . Other examples are visible here and here .\n\nOn July 20, 2020 Biden sought support from Muslim Americans during an online event hosted by Emgage Action, a membership organization mobilizing around issues affecting American Muslims ( here , emgageaction.org/about-us/ ).\n\nSpeaking virtually before the Million Muslims Vote Summit, Biden said, \u201cI wish we taught more in our schools about the Islamic faith.\u201d He added: \u201cI wish we talked about all the great confessional faiths. It\u2019s one of the great confessional faiths.\u201d\n\nBiden specified that, from a theological standpoint, \u201cwhat we don\u2019t realize is that we all come from the same root here, in terms of our fundamental basic beliefs.\u201d ( here )\n\nDuring his remarks, Biden did not imply substituting the teachings of one religion over another but encouraged learning broadly about the \u201cconfessional faiths\u201d, or faiths usually associated with a formal statement of doctrinal belief, including different denominations of Christianity and Judaism.\n\nBiden is a Roman Catholic who for years has written and spoken publicly about his faith ( here ). Most recently, Biden has leaned into his religious commitments, emphasizing his faith during the presidential election and the Democratic National Convention this past week ( here ).\n\nBiden has previously called the separation of church and state as fundamental. ( here )\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with separating my specific beliefs as a Catholic from my role as a public official, sworn to protect agnostics, atheists, and the most religious conservatives,\u201d Biden said in 2007. (see minute 3:53)\n\nMissing context. Joe Biden said schools should teach more about the \u201cconfessional faiths\u201d but did not imply the U.S. should substitute the teachings of one religion over another. The posts on social media misrepresent his remarks.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .", "lang": "en"}
