The likelihood of the transmission of the virus in public transports resulting from overcrowding led health experts to recommend mitigating protocols like social distancing or spacing in vehicles.\n\nThis concern for managing the challenge of COVID spread in a confined setting within which people congregate led the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to develop some guidance for the transportation sector.\n\nThis, however, triggered its own complications, as in South Africa, where it was reported that social distancing was affecting the country\u2019s dysfunctional and vital public transport with commuters struggling to get transportation to destinations and drivers recording losses.\n\nDubawa conducted internet research and found some contact tracing studies and research conducted elsewhere which found fewer cases of COVID-19 infections in public transportation.\n\nA recent study conducted by researchers at Sante Publique France, the National Public Health Agency and published on June 4, 2020, identified 150 COVID-19 infections and found that none of the 150 cases was traced to any form of transportation.\n\nA similar study in Austria found that not one of 355 case clusters in April and May was traceable to those in transit.\n\nAlso, a cluster of COVID-19 disease in communities in Japan between January and April, 2020 came to a conclusion that fewer percentage of \u201csuper-spreader\u201d events was traced to public transport.\n\nHowever, the studies revealed that the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 was higher in offices, restaurants and bars.\n\nThe daily mail reported on its website on August 3 that there was no available data in the UK about the risk of contracting COVID-19 on public transport.\n\nThe report added that analysis of contact tracing data by Sam Schwartz, a former New York City traffic commissioner, found that only four per cent of 1,300 of COVID-19 hospital admissions in early May had used public transport prior to infection.\n\nWe further spoke to Dr Kwabena Sarpong, Deputy Director of GHS in Charge of Public Health in the Central Region, to get an understanding of the transmission of the virus in public transport. He said that people are at low risk of contracting COVID-19 in public transport.\n\n\u201cI know some works have been done which suggests that there is a low risk of contracting the virus in public transport compared to other places but that does not also mean it is impossible to contract it in public transport,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further explained that people are not likely to talk, sing, and shout in buses and indicated that the virus spread through droplets from an infected person through speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing.\n\n\u201cIf you are in a public transport loaded to capacity, you have to exercise personal responsibility and ensure that you wear the approved face masks and also make sure you or the person sitting close to you does not talk or shout,\u201d he added.\n\nContracting COVID-19 on public transport is far less likely than it was earlier feared. Although it is not 100 per cent certain that one can not contract COVID-19 in public transports, its infection rates, according to studies, are very low.\n\nThe reporter produced this fact-check under the auspices of the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship in partnership with Ghana News Agency to facilitate the ethos of \u201ctruth\u201d in journalism and to enhance media literacy in the country.", "lang": "en"}
