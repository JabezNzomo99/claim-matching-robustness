No, that's a fake quote, made up by a website that plagiarises articles from other websites about real news events and then adds some invented claims in the headline and first paragraphs to attract more clicks and make more advertising money. The quotes attributed to Obama in the title of the article and first paragraphs are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by YourNewsWire on August 4, 2018 titled \"Obama: \"I Fully Support Seizure Of White Farmers' Land In South Africa\"\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nBarack Obama has praised the South African government's recent decision to legalize the seizure of land from white farmers. In a speech delivered at the 2018 Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture in Johannesburg, Obama heaped praise on the South African president for amending the constitution and allowing people to steal land from white farmers without compensation. During the speech Obama also called for a guaranteed income.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, which contains no actual real facts:\n\nObama did go to South Africa and he did deliver a speech there, which you can read in full here:\n\nNowhere in the speech do the words \"white farmers\", \"seizure\" or \"seize\" even appear. These quotes are completely made up by YourNewsWire.\n\nMost of the rest of the article is copied from Gateway Pundit:\n\nThat story is slightly more accurate. Obama did indeed praise President Ramaphosa in passing during the introduction of his speech, in which he also mentioned several other people present for the lecture:\n\nThank you. To Mama Gra\u00e7a Machel, members of the Mandela family, the Machel family, to President Ramaphosa who you can see is inspiring new hope in this great country, professor, doctor, distinguished guests, to Mama Sisulu and the Sisulu family, to the people of South Africa, it is a singular honour for me to be here with all of you as we gather to celebrate the birth and life of one of history's true giants.\n\nYou can certainly call a passing mention during the introduction of a speech about someone inspiring new hope \"praise\" and you can get worked up about that if you don't like the policies that person is involved with.\n\nBut then invending new quotes out of whole cloth? That's fake news!\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Whistleblower Who Exposed Clinton's Ties To NXIVM LIKELY NOT Missing, Feared Dead\n\u2022 Fake News: Peter Strzok's Wife, Who Is SEC Director, Could NOT Have Blocked All FBI Investigations Into Clintons\n\u2022 Fake News: UK Government Did NOT Sell 10,000 Children To Child Traffickers\n\u2022 Fake News: Merkel Did NOT Ban Media Reporting Migrant Beheaded 1-Year-Old Girl In Germany\n\u2022 Fake News: Australia NOT To Bankrupt Parents Who Don't Vaccinate", "lang": "en"}
