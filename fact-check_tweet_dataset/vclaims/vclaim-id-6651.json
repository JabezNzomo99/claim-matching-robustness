But, under current Senate rules, it takes 60 votes (three-fifths of the Senate) to end debate on most legislation. Until Democrats changed the rules in 2013, it also took 60 votes to end debate on executive branch and most judicial nominations.\n\nThe last Supreme Court nominee who faced a cloture vote was Samuel A. Alito Jr. in 2006. He won it handily, 72 to 25. After the cloture vote, senators voted on whether to confirm Alito. The vote was 58 to 42. (He earned the support of four Democrats, but was opposed by one Republican and one Republican-turned-Independent.)\n\nAlthough the effort to filibuster Alito failed miserably, it served as a vehicle for potential White House contenders (such as Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden) to demonstrate their liberal credentials. Obama, as president, later regretted supporting the filibuster of Alito, what his spokesman called a \u201csymbolic vote.\u201d\n\nThere have been three other cloture votes concerning the Supreme Court, two involving William H. Rehnquist, the late chief justice. In 1971, a motion to invoke cloture for his initial appointment to the court failed by a vote of 52 to 42, but he was nevertheless confirmed later that day, 68 to 26. When Rehnquist was nominated to become chief justice in 1986, he was confirmed 65 to 33 after cloture was also invoked by a vote of 68 to 31.\n\nThe only other cloture vote concerned Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas, at the time an associate justice, to be chief justice. The Fortas nomination eventually ran aground on ethics issues and his close relationship with Johnson, already a lame duck, and he eventually withdrew after his nomination failed a cloture vote. At the time, Senate rules required approval of two-thirds of the Senate to end debate \u2014 and Fortas could achieve only a vote of 45 to 43.\n\nHere are the final votes for the current members of the court. We have noted in bold the two sitting justices who did not receive 60 votes for confirmation.\n\nJohn Kraus, communications director for Baldwin, said: \u201cWhile it wasn\u2019t explicit, she was referring to Supreme Court justices appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents, the last six of which earned 60 votes, including the most recent Obama nominees, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan.\u201d\n\nDemocrats such as Baldwin appear to be arguing that because Alito received more than 60 votes on the vote to end debate, he met the \u201c60-vote\u201d standard, even though he did not receive 60 votes for confirmation. But Baldwin, in her interview, referred to \u201cearning 60 bipartisan votes in the United States Senate,\u201d which certainly sounds different from a mere cloture vote.\n\nDemocrats continue to be slippery with their language. Sixty votes is not \u201ca standard\u201d for Supreme Court confirmations, as two of the current justices on the court did not meet that supposed standard to get on the court.", "lang": "en"}
