A majority of these posts are in Bengali, and they mock the Bengal CM over her supposed \u2018hypocrisy\u2019.\n\nAlt News received the same image on its official app, for verification.\n\nThe photograph of Mamata Banerjee and Amit Shah together, is photoshopped. This was confirmed by a simple reverse image search on Google, which revealed the original photograph. The image pertains to a most recent meeting between the two leaders, on September 18. Mamata Banerjee had visited Amit Shah at his office in New Delhi, to discuss the controversial National Register for Citizens (NRC) exercise.\n\nAs can be seen in the above image posted in a News18 article, there does not seem to be any text on the envelope, unlike the words \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019 inscribed in the photoshopped image. The two pictures- photoshopped and original, are juxtaposed and posted below for comparison.\n\nA video report of the meeting, broadcast by NDTV, is posted below.\n\nIt may be noted that Mamata Banerjee and Amit Shah are NOT holding an envelope with \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019 written on it. The original image, clicked at a recent meeting between the two leaders, has been tampered with.", "lang": "en"}
