The number jumped from 799,501 when the ACA became law in 2010, to 860,939 in 2015, the most recent data available. The increase is similar to the 9 percent jump over the previous five-year period, from 2005 to 2010, according to figures provided to us by the AAMC.\n\nSince 2010, the number of physicians in internal medicine or providing family and general practice care \u2014 the two largest specialties \u2014 also has increased more than 4 percent.\n\nCertainly, not all physicians are happy with the health care law. A 2016 survey by the Physicians Foundation and Merritt Hawkins, a consulting firm on physician staffing, found that 48.3 percent of physicians who responded gave the ACA a grade of D or F. A small percentage gave the law an A, and 48.5 percent gave it a B or C.\n\nBut Grover said that \u201crecent data from the Association of American Medical Colleges indicate that physicians are, in fact, retiring two years later than they had previously.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cthere is also no evidence of a declining interest in medicine since the ACA took effect.\u201d We pointed that out last month when Sen. Ted Cruz claimed that \u201cObamacare is discouraging people from going to medical school.\u201d In fact, medical school applicants and enrollees are at an all-time high.\n\nAs we reported in that story, Grover\u2019s organization has projected a physician shortfall in coming years, due primarily to an aging population. The AAMC set a goal of increasing first-year medical student enrollment by 30 percent by 2015-2016 (from the 2002-2003 level) to address this issue, and it nearly hit that mark on schedule. First-year enrollment is expected to reach the AAMC\u2019s goal by 2017-2018, according to the organization\u2019s 2015 enrollment report.\n\n\u201cThe real challenge the physician workforce faces,\u201d Grover said, \u201cis the cap on federal support for graduate medical education established by Congress 20 years ago. As a result, there are not enough residency positions to fill demand.\u201d\n\nWe requested supporting evidence for the president\u2019s claim from the White House, but we haven\u2019t yet received a response. We will update this item if we do.", "lang": "en"}
