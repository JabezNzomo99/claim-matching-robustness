What O\u2019Rourke said was \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47\u201d. The AR-15 and the AK-47 can only be legally sold as semiautomatic weapons in the U.S.\n\nA video circulating on Facebook is headlined \u201cJoe Biden says if he wins he's coming for our guns\u201d. The 16 second clip of Joe Biden, Beto O\u2019Rourke and his wife Amy O\u2019Rourke eating at a Whataburger in Texas has at least 13,520 shares and 639,427 views on different posts as of March 5, 2020 (See examples here and here).\n\nThis video does not show Joe Biden saying if he wins he\u2019s coming for our guns. What he is saying is that \u201che\u2019s coming\u201d for Beto O\u2019Rourke, if he\u2019s elected President. This is in reference to Biden\u2019s interest in having O\u2019Rourke be part of his potential future team.\n\nThis is what Biden says in the clip (visible in Beto\u2019s original, longer live version of the clip posted also here\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, this guy (points at Beto O\u2019Rourke) can change the face of what we are doing here, with regard to guns, assault weapons, with regard to dealing with climate change. And I was just warning Amy (points at Amy O\u2019Rourke) \u2018If I win, I\u2019m coming for him\u2019(points to Beto O\u2019Rourke)\u201d.\n\nThe clip was taken from a live transmission on Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s official Facebook page (see full video here) on March 2, 2020. The full video titled \u201cWhataburger!\u201d shows Biden and the O\u2019Rourkes in the fast food restaurant after Beto endorsed Biden's campaign for president in Dallas, Texas.\n\nIt is worth noting that earlier that day, after accepting O\u2019Rourke\u2019s endorsement (see O\u2019Rourke\u2019s endorsement here), Biden told Beto that if elected President, Beto would be the one to \u201ctake care of the gun problem, you\u2019re going to be the one who leads this effort\u201d (see the moment here).\n\nO\u2019Rourke is widely known for his strong position on gun control and support for the mandatory buyback of assault weapons. In the September 2019 Democratic Debate, O\u2019Rourke created a viral moment when saying if elected \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore\u201d. (See Reuters\u2019 story here and watch the viral debate moment here) This is likely where this video headline stems from.\n\nJoe Biden has also called for a federal gun buyback program to reduce the number of weapons on the street. He also supports renewing an expired assault weapons ban imposed in the 1990\u2019s and universal background checks for gun sales. (See more on Joe Biden\u2019s gun control position here).\n\nThis claim is partly false. This video does not show Biden saying if he wins he\u2019s coming for your guns, but that \u201che\u2019s coming\u201d for Beto O\u2019Rourke, if he\u2019s elected president. This is in reference to O\u2019Rourke being part of his future team, to lead gun control efforts. However it is worth mentioning that in the past, O\u2019Rourke openly and famously said he would take away semiautomatic weapons (though not \u201cguns\u201d) from Americans (\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47\u201d).\n\nPartly false: Joe Biden does not say he\u2019s coming for Americans\u2019 guns if he wins; he says he will come for O\u2019Rourke to lead his gun control efforts, and O\u2019Rourke has said he\u2019d go after AR-15s and AK-47s.", "lang": "en"}
