No, that's not true: a Macedonian fake news site embellished an actual claim they made to their victims (which was revealed during their 2014 trial) and put it into a misleading headline.\n\nThe story recently went viral again with an article published by TVRTINFO.COM on December 17, 2018 titled \"MUSLIM SOMALI SEX GANG SAY RAPING WHITE BRITISH CHILDREN \"PART OF THEIR CULTURE\" - tvrtinfo.com\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nHowever the entire article was basically copy-pasted from this Mail Online story from November 2014:\n\nKey quote from the article:\n\nOf the four girls, three were white and one mixed race, with a fifth girl witnessing many of the sickening assaults.
