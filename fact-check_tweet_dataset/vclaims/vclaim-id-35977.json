While there is photographic and video evidence that the president\u2019s hair may not be as full as it once was (he is, by the way, 73 years old), we\u2019ve also encountered quite a few fake photographs that purported to show Trump as nearly bald.\n\nIn August 2019, we encountered yet another example of follicle fakery. A picture supposedly showing Trump\u2019s badly thinning hair blowing in the wind was posted to Reddit and Imgur, along with a caption that apparently tried to push the picture into viral infamy via the so-called Streisand Effect: \u201cDonald Trump wants this picture removed from the internet. DON\u2019T SHARE IT!\u201d\n\nThis is not a genuine photograph of Trump, and the president has not made any public comments about having this image removed from the internet.\n\nThis manipulated picture is based on of a genuine photograph of Trump snapped as he boarded Air Force One. The picture was taken in April 2018 by photographer Evan Vucci for Associated Press. A cropped version of the real image went viral after it was included in a Buzzfeed listicle of \u201c12 Photos Of Trump Boarding Air Force One On A Very Windy Day.\u201d\n\nThe original picture is available via Associated Press with the caption: \u201cPresident Donald Trump boards Air Force One for a trip to White Sulphur Springs, W.Va, for a event on tax policy, Thursday, April 5, 2018, at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\u201d\n\nThe creator of the doctored photograph shown above retouched it to make Trump\u2019s hair appear thinner than normal.
