The video has been shared in a misleading context; it has previously circulated in media reports about people queuing for face masks in Singapore after the novel coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe 49-second video was published here on Facebook on February 9, 2020. It has been viewed more than 23,000 times and shared more than 740 times.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, written in a combination of Malay and Thai language, translates to English as: \u201cSingaporean people queued up to find Halal food at Mustafa Centre, they don\u2019t dare to eat non-halal food anymore.\u201d\n\nMustafa Centre is a large department store in the district of Little India in Singapore, famous for operating 24 hours a day.\n\nThe same video has also been shared here, here, here and here on Facebook, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe video has been shared in a misleading context; it actually shows people queuing around the Mustafa Centre building for face masks following the novel coronavirus outbreak.\n\nA Google reverse image search combined with a keyword search found this article headlined: \u201cQueue for masks at Mustafa going ridiculously strong for at least 2 straight days\u201d on the website of the Singaporean news outlet Mothership SG.\n\nThe first two lines of the report, published on February 8, 2020, read: \"Masks and sanitisers are now short in supply in Singapore, due to the coronavirus outbreak. While major pharmacies and supermarkets appear to be out of stock, Mustafa, the place that sells everything, still has supplies.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Mothership SG article:\n\nThe report on a nationwide shortage of masks hand sanitisers included this earlier version of the same video seen in the misleading posts. The video has been embedded below.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and a Mothership SG photo (R), with identifiable structures circled in red by AFP:\n\nThe long queues outside Mustafa Centre have also been reported in local media. In this January 28, 2020 report by English-language newspaper The Strait Times, it states \u201cmore than a hundred customers\u201d queued outside Mustafa Centre on January 28 to buy face masks as demand surged amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAs of February 18, 2020, the novel coronavirus has killed more than 2,000 people and infected at least 74,000 others in China alone. It has also infected hundreds more abroad, as reported here by AFP.", "lang": "en"}
