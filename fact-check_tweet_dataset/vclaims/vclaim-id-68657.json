Mark Pocan frequently criticizes the administration of Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2017, the Madison-area Democrat got a little more personal, tweeting this about Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin:\n\nMnuchin wants to use a gov't jet that costs $25k/hour for his honeymoon. And he's in charge of tax reform for the middle class? #OutOfTouch\n\nWhat\u2019s this all about?\n\nMnuchin is a former longtime banker, Goldman Sachs executive and a Hollywood producer (\"The Lego Batman Movie\" and others). When tapped for Trump\u2019s Cabinet in late 2016, he was worth $300 million, according to Forbes. As treasury secretary, Mnuchin advises Trump on economic and financial issues. In June 2017, with Vice President Mike Pence officiating, he married Scottish actress Louise Linton. Their honeymoon was in August 2017, according to news reports.\n\nPocan\u2019s tweet was sent the same day ABC News broke a story that was picked up by the Washington Post, USA Today and many other national media.\n\u2022 Mnuchin requested, in writing, a U.S. Air Force jet to take him and his actress-model wife Louise Linton on their honeymoon to Scotland, France and Italy.\n\u2022 The jet could cost $25,000 per hour to operate, according to an Air Force spokesman.\n\u2022 A Treasury Department spokesman said Mnuchin made the request out of concern for maintaining a secure method of communication, but the secretary's office decided (before ABC\u2019s story) that the use of military aircraft was unnecessary after it became apparent that other methods for secure communication were available.\n\nSo, based on the news report, Mnuchin\u2019s request isn\u2019t current, as Pocan\u2019s tweet suggests, and the cost isn\u2019t necessarily $25,000 per hour.\n\nBut the thrust of the claim is correct: Mnuchin requested a military jet for his honeymoon.\n\nWhen we asked the Treasury Department about Pocan\u2019s claim, we were referred to a video clip of an interview Mnuchin did with Politico the day after the ABC News story aired. Asked about the matter, he said:\n\u2022 \"I probably spend over 50 percent of my time on national security issues \u2026.This had nothing to do with convenience, this was purely about national security.\"\n\u2022 \"The government has never paid for any of my personal travel.\"\n\u2022 \"My staff wanted to make sure that I constantly had access to secure communication\" and the use of a jet for his honeymoon \"was one of the things we explored. So, they put in a request to consider the use of an aircraft ... and ultimately we withdrew the request. We found a way of dealing with other secure communication.\"\n\u2022 Asked whether the jet was a staff request, not his personal request, Mnuchin said: \"Again, I discussed with the staff a bunch of alternatives \u2026 one of the things they suggested, I agreed that they would look into it, OK? We looked into other things, as well. When we found alternative uses, we withdrew the request.\"\n\nSo, Mnuchin doesn\u2019t deny requesting the jet, though he suggests it was out of concern for national security.\n\nAs of Sept. 14, 2017, the day after the ABC story, the Treasury Department\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office was looking at all requests for, and use of, government aircraft by Mnuchin, that office told reporters.\n\nThe inquiry was launched after Mnuchin and his wife took a trip to Kentucky just ahead of the August 2017 solar eclipse. Mnuchin held an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and visited Fort Knox, where he and Linton viewed the eclipse near the path of totality, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nTreasury officials defended that visit as official government travel and said Mnuchin would reimburse the government for bringing his wife along.\n\nPocan says Mnuchin \"wants to use a government jet that costs $25,000 per hour for his honeymoon.\"\n\nPocan\u2019s use of wants wrongly suggests it is a pending request, and the news report he cites said the jet could cost $25,000 an hour.\n\nBut essentially Pocan is on target: Mnuchin put in a request for a government plane to take him and his wife to their honeymoon destinations, though he did not use one.", "lang": "en"}
