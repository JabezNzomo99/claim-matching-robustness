On July 25, Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Just days earlier, Trump unexpectedly ordered the withholding of nearly $400 million in military aid to the country, which is battling a separatist conflict backed by Russia on its Eastern border. What was said on the call is not precisely known \u2014 though Trump has said he will release the transcript \u2014 but Trump has acknowledged he raised former vice president Joe Biden, currently leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nBut neither of those concerns was communicated over the summer to anxious lawmakers who did not understand why the money was being withheld. \u201cAdministration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an \u2018interagency process\u2019 but to give them no additional information \u2014 a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cAs far as withholding funds, those funds were paid, they were fully paid. But my complaint has always been \u2014 and I\u2019d withhold again, and I\u2019ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine. Because they\u2019re not doing it; it\u2019s the United States. We\u2019re putting up the bulk of the money. \u2026 Europe has to put up money for Ukraine also. Why is it only the United States putting up the money? \u2026 Germany, France, other countries should put up money, and that\u2019s been my complaint from the beginning.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not correct. Europe has been a major funder to Ukraine since Russia annexed its Crimean Peninsula in 2014, often providing more aid than the United States. The European Union has provided more than 15 billion euros ($16.5 billion) in grants and loans to Ukraine, according to an E.U. fact sheet on relations with Ukraine. Meanwhile, NATO has its own military cooperation program with Ukraine, establishing six trust funds to assist the country in improving its military readiness. The United States provided $1.3 billion to Ukraine since late 2013, according to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report.\n\nTrump would be on more solid ground if he had kept his complaint strictly to military aid. \u201cThe United States is the largest provider of military aid to Ukraine,\u201d said John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine now at the Atlantic Council. He said there was \u201cskittishness\u201d among many European countries that \u201cdon\u2019t want to provoke Russia,\u201d with mainly Britain, Poland, Baltic nations and Canada joining the United States in contributing military aid. But this is how the aid burden is usually divided between the United States and the Europeans, with the United States providing the muscle and Europe providing the \u201csoft power\u201d to stabilize troubled nations.\n\n\u201cAmerican investigators have the full right to turn to the U.S. and to get this information,\u201d Prystaiko said. \u201cIf they think that our president has been pressured, they can establish this. I know what they spoke about, and I don\u2019t think there was any coercion. There was a talk, talks can be on different topics, leaders have the right to talk about any problems they wish. This conversation was long, it was friendly, and it touched on a lot of questions, some of which required rather serious answers.\u201d\n\nBut it turns out that the investigation had already been shelved when Biden acted and may have even involved a side company, not Burisma. Hunter Biden, who served on the board for five years, was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms.\n\nShokin was ousted three months after Biden\u2019s visit. \u201cBowing to pressure from international donors, the Ukrainian Parliament voted on Tuesday to remove a prosecutor general who had clung to power for months despite visible signs of corruption,\u201d the New York Times reported at the time. \u201cThe United States and other Western nations had for months called for the ousting of Mr. Shokin, who was widely criticized for turning a blind eye to corrupt practices and for defending the interests of a venal and entrenched elite.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
