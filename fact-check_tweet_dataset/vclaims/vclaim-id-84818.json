This was the most controversial provision that opponents of the law said would open up room for rampant racial profiling. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld this provision but struck down most others that were challenged \u2013 including a requirement that noncitizens carry their immigrant registration documents.\n\n\u201cPinning down exactly how much [illegal immigration] costs the state, and how much is collected from illegal immigrants through taxation, is surprisingly hard to do,\u201d it says. \u201cThe state doesn\u2019t count it. Estimates vary widely, depending in part on debatable issues such as whether to include the cost of educating U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw a great reduction in the number of undocumented immigrants in the state. Whether they moved because of Senate Bill 1070 or because the jobs just dried up and the construction industry crashed is a matter of debate,\u201d said Dan Hunting, senior policy analyst at Arizona State University\u2019s Morrison Institute for Public Policy who studies the effects of the 2010 law.\n\n[Update: Bob Davis, author of the Journal article, said \u201cit is not impossible, but it is devilishly difficult\" to separate the impact of the recession and the law. Economists found Arizona\u2019s loss of population was far greater than other states after the 2008 law, Davis said. The Journal article cites similar calculations by Moody\u2019s Analytics of how mass departures of undocumented immigrants affected Arizona\u2019s total employment spanning 2008 to 2015. Moody\u2019s found Arizona\u2019s total employment was 2.5 percent lower, on average, due to the departures.]\n\nEnrollment in such courses could be one indirect measure of the decrease in illegal immigration, budget and policy experts said. But many factors could have affected it, such as changes in testing standards used by the state. Plus, the enrollment number doesn\u2019t tell you anything about the actual citizenship status of students (i.e., they could be native-born children of undocumented immigrants, raised in a non-English-speaking home).\n\n\u201cLaws and legislation can affect access to health care, but they aren\u2019t the only factor,\u201d said Jim Haynes, the association\u2019s senior vice president and chief operating officer. \u201cThe timing of the recession and SB1070 going into effect are very close, and therefore it\u2019s difficult to clearly identify a direct correlation between SB1070 and the cost of care for illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\nCruz says Arizona is \u201cspending hundreds of millions less on prisons, on education, on hospitals, for those here illegally,\u201d as a result of the 2010 immigration law. He cites a Wall Street Journal article as the source of his claim. But the article itself is much more nuanced and less definitive than how he describes it. It shows that the economic impact of the law is still under debate, and that it is unclear whether the savings outweigh the loss in tax revenue after undocumented immigrants left the state.\n\nCruz generalizes spending trends on hospitals, prisons and education in ways the article doesn\u2019t. State Medicaid spending on undocumented patients did decrease. Arizona is spending less on incarcerating noncitizens, but that does not necessarily mean they are all undocumented. As for education, the Journal article uses one measure that could reflect the decrease in illegal immigration. But there is no direct measure of education spending on noncitizens. Plus, none of the figures in the Journal article support his claim that the state is saving \u201chundreds of millions,\u201d except for the one education measure that doesn\u2019t directly quantify spending on undocumented students.\n\nThe big problem with Cruz\u2019s claim is that he uses the nuanced reporting in the Journal article to draw a causation that can\u2019t be proved. There was an exodus of undocumented immigrants around the time the 2010 law passed. But those populations were leaving state as the recession began, and continued to leave the state. There\u2019s no proof that them doing so was a result of the law, the recession, or a combination of the two.", "lang": "en"}
