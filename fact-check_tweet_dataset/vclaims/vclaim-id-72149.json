The woman was raised by many pundits after the election.\n\n\"You look at the kind of Republican areas, the rural areas, Senator Warner ran 8-10 points ahead of a traditional Democrat -- ahead of Senator Kaine, ahead of Governor McAuliffe in those areas -- which is more than the margin of victory at the end of the day,\" he said.\n\nWarner has long prided himself as a vote-getter in rural Virginia, pursuing a so-called \"Bubba strategy,\" attending NASCAR races and even commissioning a blue-grass campaign song during his successful 2001 run for governor.\n\nWe examined whether Warner this year really did top the past rural vote performances of two stalwarts in his party -- Sen. Tim Kaine and Gov. Terry McAuliffe -- by the 8-10 percent margin Hallock cited.\n\nThe first step was to define rural Virginia. We relied on a state highlighting 52 localities that the federal government defines as rural. Then, we compared Warner\u2019s 2014 votes in those places to the results from McAuliffe\u2019s 2013 gubernatorial election and Kaine\u2019s 2012 Senate contest.\n\nHere\u2019s how the statewide rural vote broke down:\n\nThe rural localities form six regions. Here\u2019s how Warner\u2019s performance compared to the other Democrats in each of those areas:\n\u2022 \u201cAmerica has 133 million registered voters,\u201d but \u201c159 million votes\u201d were cast in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe 39 percent overall rural vote for Warner this fall was considerably below the level he achieved during his other successful campaigns. Warner got 61.2 percent of the rural vote in his 2008 landslide victory for the U.S. Senate over Republican Jim Gilmore; he got 51.2 percent in his 2001 gubernatorial win over Republican Mark Earley.\n\nStephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said the decline in Warner\u2019s vote percentages this year -- not just in rural areas but across Virginia -- may be due to the senator\u2019s positioning as a centrist.\n\n\"The moderate strategy that worked so well for Warner back in the day, just doesn\u2019t work as well today,\" Farnsworth said. \"The real polarization of politics means there\u2019s just not as many people interested in a moderate politician. The strategy of winning over moderate rural voters doesn\u2019t work well when there aren\u2019t many moderate rural voters.\"\n\nAs we mentioned, a number of pundits question whether some of Warner\u2019s time courting rural voters would have been better spent wooing Northern Virginians. We\u2019re not taking sides in this debate, but thought we\u2019d offer a few statistics to put it in perspective.\n\nUnofficially, Warner won by 17,723 votes. The State Board of Elections is scheduled the certify the final results on Monday.\n\nIn rural Virginia, Gillespie got 163,608 votes and Warner received 108,772. Gillespie won a 54,386-vote edge.\n\nIn Northern Virginia, Warner gained 358,878 votes, 57.4 percent, and Gillespie got 252,584 votes, 40.4 percent. Warner won a 106,294-vote advantage in the region.\n\nHallock said Warner, in this fall\u2019s Senate election, ran \"8-10 points ahead\" of past performances by fellow Democrats McAuliffe and Kaine in rural Virginia.\n\nHe\u2019s flat out wrong. McAuliffe\u2019s portion of the rural vote, in his 2013 gubernatorial victory, was 3.6 percentage points below Warner\u2019s. Kaine\u2019s slice of the rural vote, in his 2012 Senate win, was 2.4 percentage points above Warner\u2019s.\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story said Hallock did not respond to three emails seeking data for his claim.
