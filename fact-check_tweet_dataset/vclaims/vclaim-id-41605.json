Some users have shared (archived) that the photo was taken in Mizoram. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of social distancing in a market was taken in Manipur (India). Fact: The photo was taken neither in Manipur nor in Mizoram. It was taken at the Kalaw market in the Shan state of Myanmar. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nBelow the photo, a user has commented that the photo was taken at \u2018the Kalaw market in the Shan state of Myanmar\u2019.\n\nSo, when searched with keywords, many tweets and news blog articles were found saying that the photos were taken in Myanmar (not in any Indian State). As the photos are being shared in both the countries, let\u2019s look for some clues to confirm the location of the photos.\n\nWhen searched for the Kalaw market photos on Google, a photo similar to the location in the posted photo was found.\n\nOn a hoarding, in the photo, an advertisement with the brand \u2018High Class\u2019 can be seen. So, when searched with the keywords, it was found that it is the advertisement of \u2018Seagram\u2019s High Class \u2013 Myanmar\u2019. (Seagram\u2019s High Class Whisky was launched in Myanmar in October 2018)\n\nAlso, other photos of the same hoarding taken at different times with different types of advertisements can be found here and here. (The location of those photos was mentioned as Kalaw market, Myanmar).\n\nSome more latest photos of the same market were found on Twitter. In those photos, the vendors are sitting under the umbrellas of \u2018mytel\u2019. \u2018mytel\u2019 is a mobile network company in Myanmar.\n\nTo sum it up, with all the clues found, it can be concluded that the market photos were taken in Myanmar, not in India.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
