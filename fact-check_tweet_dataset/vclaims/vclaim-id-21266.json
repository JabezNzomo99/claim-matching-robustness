No, that's not true: a Canadian satire website made up the story to mock Trump's recent remarks about Canadians smuggling new pairs of shoes across the border by wearing them and scuffing them on purpose to avoid tarifs.\n\nThe satirical story originated from an article published on June 20, 2018 by The Beaverton and was titled \"Exclusive: A Canadian shoe smuggling mule who's able to fit 9 pairs in his rectum when he crosses US border\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nFORT ERIE, ON - A Canadian shoe smuggler has gone to great lengths to remain undetected by border security revealing a dangerous game between cat and mouse. When US President Donald Trump warned that Canadians were smuggling shoes from the US into Canada and \"scuffing them up,\" he was referring to people like Dave, a man capable of transporting up to nine pairs of new shoes in his rectum. Dave is not his real name as the editors have chosen to protect his identity. \"I run the risk of paying a duty or even a fine if I'm caught,\" said Dave wearing a balaclava and sunglasses. \"Or nothing. Usually it's nothing if I declare them, but this is far more dangerous.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so some of them might have thought it was real:\n\nThe New York Times has more background on Trump's claims regarding shoe smuggling:\n\nExplaining Trump's Claim About Canadians Smuggling Shoes Because of 'Massive' Tariffs what was said \"There was a story two days ago, in a major newspaper, talking about people living in Canada, coming into the United States, and smuggling things back into Canada because the tariffs are so massive.The tariffs to get common items back into Canada are so high that they have to smuggle them in.They buy shoes, then they wear them.They scuff them up.They make them sound old or look old.\"\n\nThe Beaverton is a satirical website that carries following disclaimer:\n\nThe Beaverton is a news satire and parody publication .
