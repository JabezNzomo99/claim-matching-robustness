The claim is false; a reverse image search found that the picture is a doctored version of a photo showing Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican in 2016.\n\nThe photo, which has been posted on Facebook here and on Reddit here, purports to show Pope Francis shaking Duterte\u2019s hand.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post\n\nThe post, when translated to English, says: \u201cThis is not being shown by the media because the only thing they know is to criticize. In President Duterte's state visit to the Vatican Pope Francis talked to him and told him 'God will save you from your critics'.\u201d\n\nDuterte once called Francis \u201cson of a whore\u201d, but later sent the pope a letter expressing his \u201chighest esteem and respect\u201d.\n\nDuterte made plans to visit the pope and personally apologise for the remark, but subsequently canceled them.\n\nA reverse image search traced the photo in the misleading posts back to this news article that the Associated Press news agency published on August 29, 2016.\n\nThe article is about Pope Francis meeting Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:\n\nThe altered image, which includes Duterte, has been posted on Facebook since September 2018.\n\nThe doctored photo and the original both contain these key details: a circular painting in the background, a dark-coloured tie and a plant in a white pot on the image\u2019s far right.\n\nComments such as the one below indicate that some Facebook users believed the doctored photo was real.\n\nThis one, when translated to English, says: \u201cI'm really in awe of Pres. Duterte, it's like handling a plant, you go straight to the root and not to the branches. The president is right that instead of critics, you go straight to the POPE who will say the truth, with advice and blessings even\u201d.\n\nThe photo has been shared more than 12,000 times by Facebook groups which support Duterte\u2019s allies since it was first posted in September 2018.", "lang": "en"}
