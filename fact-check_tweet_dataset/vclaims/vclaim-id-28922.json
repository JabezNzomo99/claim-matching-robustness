We\u2019ll attempt to update this piece in 2089 when more data becomes available.\n\nBut as a prediction, this appears optimistic.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics estimated in 2017 that 17.2% of UK women aged 30 (about one in six) will reach their 100th birthday. For men the chance of reaching 100 is 12.5% (one in eight).\n\nEven for newborns at the time, the chance of reaching 100 was less than a third (23.4% for boys and 29.2% for girls).\n\nWe\u2019ve asked Mr Hancock\u2019s office for more information on his figures.", "lang": "en"}
