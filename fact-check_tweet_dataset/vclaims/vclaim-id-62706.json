Further, an earlier source of this quote was a site that propagated fake news.\n\nThe claim was being circulated as early as October 2016, as shown by a video containing the quote posted by YouTube channel PRRD realworld. The video cites globalnews.favradio.fm as its source.\n\nWhile the site is no longer active, an archived copy in Wayback Machine shows that the article from globalnews.favradio.fm only indicated the quote without citing a source. Vera Files, another fact-checking organization, also previously debunked a false claim that was sourced from the same website.\n\nIn the past, Rappler also debunked other false claims involving Villegas. These include a post claiming Villegas said that not voting for Otso Diretso betrays God, and another one claiming he said that the suspects for the rape and murder of Christine Silawan should not be punished. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
