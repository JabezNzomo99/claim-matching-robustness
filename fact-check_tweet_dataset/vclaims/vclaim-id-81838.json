In fact, four out of seven PolitiFact Lies of the Year have been related to the Affordable Care Act, including that the 2010 law was a \"government takeover of health care.\"\n\nThe Lie of the Year in 2010 debunked statements that suggested the Affordable Care Act represented a \"government takeover of health care.\" The main finding was that the plan would increase government regulation, but it would continue to rely on private insurers to provide coverage for most Americans.\n\nBeruff\u2019s claim falls into a similar trap because it glazes over private insurers\u2019 roles, but doesn\u2019t go as far as to suggest a government takeover.\n\nBeruff\u2019s spokesperson cited the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which requires most individuals to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty, called the individual shared responsibility payment.\n\nThat mandate, which took effect in 2014, is due every month an individual doesn\u2019t have health insurance that meets the minimum essential coverage. The penalty is assessed on tax returns, and increases every year a person remains uninsured.\n\nNo one is forced to buy government health insurance via the individual mandate, but individuals are strongly incentivized to have the minimum essential health coverage to avoid the penalty.\n\nSome may consider the individual mandate to be \"forcing\" people to get coverage, but people can choose to remain without health insurance and defer to the fine, said Ben Sommers, an assistant professor of health and economics at the Harvard T.H. School of Public Health.\n\nBeruff\u2019s point isn\u2019t flat-out wrong, but his word choice is problematic, said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. She said she wouldn\u2019t have used the word \"forced\" because the mandate only strongly encourages having health care coverage, and it doesn\u2019t have to be government coverage if your employer offers private insurance.\n\nThe individual mandate has many exemptions depending on income, membership in groups like Indian tribes, and incarceration. If individuals don\u2019t fall into those categories, the Health Insurance Marketplace lays out 14 categories of hardship exemptions that exempt people from the financial penalty if they cannot afford it. \"Hardship\" exemptions cover homelessness, filing for bankruptcy and foreclosure, and a family member\u2019s death, to name a few examples.\n\nBeruff\u2019s bigger problem is with his characterization of the Affordable Care Act as \"government health care.\"\n\nYes, the mandate requires Americans to carry health insurance. But just as before the law, the majority obtain it from private sources, such as their employer or from choosing plans offered in health insurance marketplaces set up by federal or state regulators.\n\nThe law aimed to dramatically expand public health insurance through the federal-state Medicaid program. But a Supreme Court decision has allowed 20 states, including large ones such as Texas and Florida, to not extend coverage to more low-income residents using federal dollars.\n\nIn 2014, 66 percent of people had private health insurance, and 55 percent of all people received insurance from their employers, according to a report from the Census Bureau.\n\nAny type of private health insurance must meet specific set of rules in the essential benefit package, said Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. But it\u2019s still private, not government health care.\n\nStill, Tanner said it might be fair to call the coverage \"government designated health care\" because individuals can\u2019t buy just any type of health insurance, he said. Beruff\u2019s spokesperson echoed this argument.\n\nBeruff said Washington politicians are \"already forcing you to buy government health care.\"\n\nHis statement makes a sweeping generalization, but there is some truth to the \"forcing\" part. The individual mandate incentivizes individuals to have health care or face a tax penalty. Of course, the choice is still theirs.\n\nThe bigger problem is Beruff\u2019s use of \"government health care.\" This talking point was flawed around the law\u2019s passage six years ago, and it\u2019s no more accurate now. Just as before, the country\u2019s health care system largely depends on the free market.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
