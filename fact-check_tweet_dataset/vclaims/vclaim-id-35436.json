His point effectively seems to be about inequality and the potential to redistribute the UK\u2019s significant wealth more evenly.\n\nBut to talk about potential wealth redistribution within the UK, we need to know how wealthy the average person is, not the size of the UK\u2019s GDP in total.\n\nThe more relevant measure is average GDP per person. This still has drawbacks which we\u2019ve discussed before, but it gives a clearer indication of how wealthy people are. On this measure, the UK is the 20th-or 27th-wealthiest country in the world.\n\nHow many people are in poverty in the UK?\n\nAn estimated 14.3 million people were living in poverty in the UK in 2017/18, according to the Social Metrics Commission (SMC), based on government data.\n\nThe SMC is an organisation which has been working to improve the way we understand and measure poverty in the UK. It has been publishing estimates since 2018. You can read more about how they define poverty here.\n\nAnother main measure is \u201cabsolute low income\u201d, published by the government, which estimates 12.5 million people in poverty (once housing costs are accounted for) in 2017/18.\n\nNo single number gives a \u201cdefinitive\u201d figure for poverty, as a lot depends on how you define it, but these are among the best available options.\n\nThe UK is either the sixth or ninth biggest economy in the world\n\nWhen Jeremy Corbyn says the UK is the fifth richest country in the world, he\u2019s presumably referring to the size of the UK\u2019s GDP.\n\nGDP is the total value of everything that happens within a country\u2019s economy\u2014the goods and service made and the money earned\u2014and is a common measure of the size of a country\u2019s economy.\n\nTo make a comparison between countries, you need to convert each country\u2019s GDP into a common currency.\n\nThis is most commonly done by converting local currencies into US dollars, using market exchange rates.\n\nOn this measure, the UK is the sixth-richest country in the world (and was until recently the fifth-richest).\n\nOne problem with converting currencies using market exchange rates is that different countries have different prices levels\u2014for example, $100 can buy you more goods and services in Kenya than in the USA.\n\nA measure known as \u201cpurchasing power parity\u201d (PPP) aims to account for this. On the PPP measure, the UK is the ninth-richest country in the world.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about how PPP is calculated here.\n\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s comparison is not the best\n\nJeremy Corbyn is making the point that there are 14 million people in poverty despite the UK\u2019s significant wealth. This effectively seems to be a point about inequality\u2014the UK\u2019s significant wealth could be more evenly distributed across the population to reduce poverty.\n\nBut if we want to talk about the poverty and wealth redistribution, the total size of a country\u2019s GDP isn\u2019t the best figure to use.\n\nThat\u2019s because it overlooks how big the population is and, as a result, how much wealth the average person has.\n\nFor example, consider the fact that China has a far bigger GDP than the UK ($14.2 trillion to the UK\u2019s $2.8 trillion\u2014based on market exchange rates).\n\nYet China also has a far bigger population, and as a result the average amount of GDP per person in China ($10,150) is significantly lower than in the UK ($42,310).\n\nSo despite China being a much bigger economy, the average person is much wealthier in the UK.\n\nOn the basis of GDP per capita, the UK is the 20th-richest country in the world (using market exchange rates), or the 27thth-richest using PPP.\n\nThat still makes the UK one of the world\u2019s wealthier countries. But fifth-richest is an overstatement in this context.", "lang": "en"}
