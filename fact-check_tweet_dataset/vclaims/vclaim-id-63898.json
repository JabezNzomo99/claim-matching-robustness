He arrived in Taiwan on Sunday and was greeted by officials from Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the director general of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control.\n\nIn a media release, Secretary Azar said the visit \u201crepresents an opportunity to strengthen our economic and public health cooperation with Taiwan.\u201d\n\nTaiwan, with 477 confirmed cases and only 7 deaths as of August 10, has been praised for its model strategy against the coronavirus. The visit is also likely to feature talks on Taiwan\u2019s \u201cremarkable success battling COVID-19 as a free and transparent democratic society,\u201d the release said.\n\nTaiwan welcomed Azar as an \u201cunwavering friend of Taiwan\u201d \u2013 alluding to his support for Taiwan\u2019s acceptance into the World Health Organization. Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that the trip would solidify efforts to \u201csteadily enhance such cooperative partnership on a global level so as to safeguard the shared values of democracy, freedom and human rights.\u201d\n\nThe trip comes amid rising tension between China and the United States, with President Donald Trump repeatedly labeling the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first identified in China, as the \u201cChina virus.\u201d Critics say Trump is trying to deflect blame for failings in the U.S. response to the virus. The country has more dead and more cases than any nation in the world.\n\nWhile Azar has cheered Taiwan\u2019s effort to join the WHO, Trump has attacked the United Nations health arm and blamed it for allowing the virus to spread from China. In June, the administration sent he U.N. notice that it would leave the WHO effective next year. The move prompted bipartisan criticism in Congress and protests from physician groups that said it would be a global setback in the fight against the pandemic. The U.S. contributes more than $400 million a year to the WHO\u2019s budget.\n\nChina has been open in expressing its dissatisfaction with the Taiwan trip. Spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry Wang Wenbin warned that the trip would \u201cseriously damage China-U.S. relations as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\u201d\n\nAmid more criticism among high-profile Chinese politicians and journalists, Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin tweeted the following:\n\n\u201cWhy haven't high-ranking US officials at the level of Azar visited Taiwan in the last 40 years? Because it is an international rule. Azar's visit is a further breach of rules and a geopolitical show.\u201d\n\nThere is no \u201cinternational rule\u201d banning high-ranking U.S. officials from visiting Taiwan. While countries have been careful to engage in diplomacy with Taiwan, this restraint has been assumed to be out of courtesy for China, which considers the island part of China and rejects any claim of Taiwanese independence. Unlike the Communist Party-run mainland, Taiwan is a functioning democracy and has held elections since 1987.\n\nFurthermore, a cabinet-level official last visited in 2014.\n\nChina has strongly protested \u2013 and successfully prevented \u2013 the inclusion of Taiwan in the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization.\n\nU.S. policy in Taiwan is coordinated by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). Although the U.S recognized the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole official government of China in 1979 via the U.S.-PRC Communique, it has stated in the communique that it would maintain economic and unofficial political relations with Taiwan.\n\nSince then, the U.S. has sent a few cabinet-level officials to Taiwan. In 2014, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy visited and gave a speech at National Taiwan University. While the EPA is part of the U.S. Interior Department and technically not a cabinet-level agency, McCarthy held cabinet-status rank under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe current administration\u2019s interaction with the Taiwanese government started out the Trump\u2019s acceptance of a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s President Tsai Ing-wen after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe call signified a reinforcement of U.S.-Taiwan relations. Not only did U.S. increase weapons sales to Taipei, in 2018 Congress passed the Taiwan Travel Act to encourage interactions between U.S. and Taiwanese officials.\n\nFurther, in March President Trump signed into law the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act, which announced the strengthening of U.S.-Taiwan diplomatic relations. Tsai called the legislation a \u201ctestament to Taiwan-U.S. friendship [and] mutual support,\u201d while China criticized it as \u201ccrude interference\u201d in China\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nAs this year\u2019s U.S. presidential campaign heated up, Trump\u2019s anti-China rhetoric has grown. Trump has been a longtime critic of China\u2019s trade policies. China is now reportedly backing out of a trade deal that Trump has billed as \u201cthe biggest deal ever seen.\u201d\n\nIn the latest clash, Trump on Aug. 6 issued an executive order banning Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat from operating in the U.S., unless the companies provided certain information to authorities. The administration claims the popular phone apps\u2019 invasive data collection threaten Americans\u2019 privacy and national security.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Wang said the move was duplicitous. \"The U.S. is using national security as an excuse and using state power to oppress non-American businesses. That\u2019s just a hegemonic practice. China is firmly opposed to that,\" he said, according to a report by Fox Business news.", "lang": "en"}
