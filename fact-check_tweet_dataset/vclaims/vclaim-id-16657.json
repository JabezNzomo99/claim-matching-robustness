No, that's not true: a site that is part of a known network of fake news sites made that claim in an article published in 2017 and it went viral (pun intended) again in 2019. In reality the CDC has reported only 1 case of Zika infection in the U.S. this year and that was from a traveler who got infected abroad.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) on Breaking 13 News where it was published on August 1, 2018 under the title \"Zika Virus Found In Recent Shipment Of Bananas; CDC Is Warning Of Safety Concerns\".
