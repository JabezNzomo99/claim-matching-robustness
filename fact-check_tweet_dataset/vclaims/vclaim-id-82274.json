And does it have \u201cdozens\u201d of nuclear weapons? (We will leave aside Rubio\u2019s assessment that 32-year-old North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who has executed many officials since taking power in 2011, is a \u201clunatic.\u201d)\n\nRubio spokesman Alex Conant provided an article that in early 2015 quoted the general in charge of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) as saying the Pentagon has concluded North Korea now has the capability to place miniaturized nuclear warheads on its latest KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\nHowever, the article also noted that the missile, said to be mobile, has not been flight-tested, raising questions about whether it could hold a nuclear weapon. Moreover, the accuracy is in question. Adm. William Gortney also asserted that the United States was capable of deflecting a North Korean attack. (South Korea\u2019s government immediately rejected the statement as alarmist, saying it assessed that North Korea had not made a nuclear weapon small enough to mount on a missile.)\n\nThe missile was first unveiled during a military parade in 2012, but questions have persisted that the display may have been a mock-up rather than an actual missile. In 2013, Adm. Sandy Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, \u201cWe believe the KN-08 probably does have the range to reach the United States.\u201d Some analysts have suggested the missile would have theoretical range of about 6,000 miles, which would put Los Angeles in its sights \u2014 assuming Pyongyang could actually target it.\n\nBut the capablities of KN-08 are still rather theoretical. Yet, another North Korean intercontinental missile, Taep\u2019o-dong-2, could also possibly reach the United States. This is the official Intelligence Community assessment (from 1999):\n\nA lot of this is guesswork, given how opaque the North Korean regime is. Different intelligence agencies do not always agree, though the military ones tend to see a greater threat from North Korea.\n\nIn 2013, the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that North Korea might have a nuclear weapon that\u2019s small enough to be placed on a ballistic missile. (It also said the reliability would be low.)\n\nBut Director of National Intelligence James Clapper almost immediately played down the DIA assessment, saying that \u201cNorth Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile.\u201d\n\nThe highest figure we could find was 20 nuclear weapons, from a Chinese estimate reported earlier in 2015 in the Wall Street Journal. But the Chinese also said that number could double within a year. Most U.S. experts believe North Korea has about a dozen weapons, but that North Korea has improved its production of weapons-grade material enough that the number of weapons could climb quickly.\n\nRubio leans a bit too far on his skis here. It\u2019s a stretch to say that North Korea has \u201cdozens\u201d of weapons or to suggest that its rockets have enough accuracy to hit the Reagan presidential library. (We note he carefully did not say those rockets were capable of carrying nuclear weapons.)", "lang": "en"}
