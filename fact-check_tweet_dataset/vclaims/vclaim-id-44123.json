In the video, a swarm of birds is seen in the parking lot of a supermarket. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of crows attack at a supermarket in Saudi Arabia. Fact: The video shows a swarm of Blackbirds outside a supermarket in Texas (USA). Also, the incident happened in 2016. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were subjected to reverse image search technique, the same video was found to be uploaded in April 2020 by a YouTube channel \u2018Viral Hog\u2019. In the description of the video, it is mentioned that the incident took place at H-Mart in Carrollton, Texas (USA) in December 2016. We searched for that mart on Google maps and compared the street view, it matched with the mart located in Texas (USA).\n\nTo summarize, the video of a swarm of birds seen outside a supermarket is from Texas (USA), not from Saudi Arabia.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
