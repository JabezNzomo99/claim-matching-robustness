Does President Obama want his retirement amount increased?\n\nThe rumor that President Obama wants to increase his retirement benefits started in March 2016 when conservative websites carried bogus stories with inaccurate headlines, such as \u201cBREAKING: Obama Just Gave Himself a MASSIVE Pay Raise\u2026FOREVER!\u201d and \u201cObama demands a higher presidential pension and more benefits!\u201d\n\nAnother site claimed that \u201cObama wants to give himself a massive reward & YOU are going to pay for it.\u201d\n\nThis led, naturally, to a Facebook image of Obama \u201cdemanding a higher pension.\u201d\n\nIn all cases, the articles referred to a March 16 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that carried a more staid headline, \u201cFormer Presidents: Pensions, Office Allowances, and Other Federal Benefits.\u201d In that report, the CRS noted that the White House\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget requested $3,865,000 \u201cfor expenditures for former Presidents, an increase of $588,000 (17.9%) from the FY2016 appropriation level.\u201d\n\nBut presidential pensions are set by law, the Former Presidents Act, and any changes would require an act of Congress, as also explained in the CRS report. Under the law, former Presidents George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in calendar year 2016 each received $205,700 \u2014 which is \u201cequal to the annual rate of basic pay for the head of an executive department (Executive Level I),\u201d as CRS explains. Nothing in Obama\u2019s request would change the pension formula.\n\nNot all of the $588,000 increase is earmarked to cover the cost of Obama\u2019s retirement. The budget justification document from the General Services Administration said $359,000 would be needed to cover the cost of Obama\u2019s pension, staff, office and other related expenses. The rest \u2014 $229,000 \u2014 is needed to cover the rising costs of expenses for the current four living former presidents.\n\nThe GSA provided this breakdown of the net $588,000 increase:\n\u2022 $9,000 increase in pension costs for Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter.\n\u2022 $9,000 decrease in travel and transportation costs for George H.W. Bush.\n\u2022 $359,000 in new spending for \u201cnew former President Barack Obama,\u201d including funds for his pension, beginning Jan, 20, 2017, as well as money for his staff, office and other related expenses, beginning on July 21, 2017.\n\u2022 $19,000 increase in additional personnel compensation for George H.W. and George W. Bush.\n\u2022 $36,000 increase in printing and communication costs for Carter, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush.\n\u2022 $163,000 increase in rental payments for Carter, George W. Bush, Clinton and George H.W. Bush.\n\u2022 $6,000 increase in equipment purchases for George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.\n\u2022 $5,000 for increased contractual services for George H.W. Bush, Carter and George W. Bush.\n\nThat adds up to a net increase of $588,000. To claim that Obama is seeking \u201ca massive pay raise \u2026 forever\u201d or that he is \u201cdemanding a higher pension\u201d is nonsense. He is merely carrying out laws passed by Congress to \u201cmaintain the dignity\u201d of the office of the president, as CRS described the congressional intent of the Former Presidents Act. That law was enacted in 1959 in large part because of former President Harry Truman\u2019s financial difficulties.\n\nA chart in the CRS report (table 1) shows that taxpayers spent $3.3 million on the former presidents in FY2015, with George W. Bush receiving the most and Carter the least:\n\nCarter\u2019s amount is much lower because his office space costs were the cheapest and, as a one-term president, he did not qualify for federally funded health benefits. Even though George H.W. Bush also served one term, he is eligible for health benefits because of his extensive government service \u2014 including as a congressman, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, ambassador to the United Nations and vice president. The total for FY2015 also included $6,000 to Nancy Reagan for communications expenses.\n\nObama will join that list on Jan. 20, 2017. That\u2019s not quite four months into fiscal year 2017, which begins Oct. 1, 2016, so the $359,000 earmarked for Obama in FY2017 does not cover a full fiscal year and cannot be compared with the amounts above.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Obama Just Gave Himself a MASSIVE Pay Raise\u2026FOREVER!\u201d The Political Insider.
