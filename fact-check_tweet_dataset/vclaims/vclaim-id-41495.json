While some social media users claimed the video was recorded in Chembur, others said it was from Ulhasnagar in neighbouring Thane district.

The incident occurred on Tuesday, July 2.\n\nThe video shows a rain-soaked street where one man can be seen trying to pull a motorcycle which is submerged completely under water. Soon, some more people come to help him and manage to pull out the bike after a lot of effort. The 45-second video has been shared widely by Twitter users like Dhaval Bheda who claimed, Big pothole in Chembur. Swallowed a bike. The twitter post was shared by over 200 people and the archived version of this tweet can be seen here. While replying to the tweet, many people slammed the local municipal corporations of Mumbai (the BMC) and of Ulhasnagar.
