(We\u2019ve also found what seems to be the original version of the graphic, from Twitter in 2017, which also doesn\u2019t seem to have been posted totally seriously either.) But it\u2019s a good excuse to talk about inflation and chocolate.\n\nOn a superficial level, the calculation is wrong because Freddos cost 10p in 1999\u2014meaning you could have bought 36 with an hour\u2019s pay on the minimum wage back then, not 72. Both the price of Freddos and the minimum wage have risen faster than inflation in the last two decades.\n\nThe internet has long revelled in tracking the dramatic rise of the cost of Freddos over time but\u2014just in case you had any doubts about it\u2014the \u201cFreddo Index\u201d isn\u2019t a good measure of inflation.\n\nInflation is the change in prices over time. There\u2019s different ways to measure inflation, but typically it\u2019s calculated by tracking the price of a typical \u201cbasket of goods\u201d.\n\nSo if that basket of goods increases from \u00a3100 to \u00a3102 over the period of a year, then the rate of inflation is 2%.\n\nAnd that means that wages need to rise at the same rate (in line with inflation) in order for us to be able to afford to buy the same things in the same amounts.\n\nBased on the government\u2019s two official measures of inflation (CPI and CPIH), if a Freddo cost 10p in 1999, and the cost then rose in line with inflation, then a Freddo should have cost 14p in 2017 (an increase of 40%) and 15p today.\n\nYet at the start of 2017 a Freddo cost 25p, and rose to 30p by March (at least in some parts of country\u2014costs seem to vary slightly across the country and between shops). That means that by March 2017 the cost of a Freddo had increased by 200% since 1999\u2014five times faster than inflation. The minimum wage has also risen much faster than the rate of inflation, though.\n\nThe National Minimum Wage was first introduced in April 1999, and was worth \u00a33.60 per hour for those aged 22 and over.\n\nBy April 2017, the National Living Wage (which superseded the National Minimum Wage) was worth \u00a37.50 for those aged 25 and over, and \u00a37.05 for those aged 21-14. Had it increased at the rate of inflation, it would have been worth around \u00a35.15 an hour.\n\nThe structure of the UK minimum wage has changed somewhat over time. In 1999, there were two rates (one for 18-21s and one for those aged 22+). Today there are five rates, covering the age brackets 16-17, 18-20, 21-24, 25+, and a separate rate for apprentices.", "lang": "en"}
