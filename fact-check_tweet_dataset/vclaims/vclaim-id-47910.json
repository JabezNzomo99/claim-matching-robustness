This clip actually shows Helen Howe, a stunt performer known as the \u201cdynamite girl,\u201d surviving the detonation of five sticks of dynamite in 1948.\n\nThis clip first went viral in 2015 when the Associated Press and British Movietone, \u201cone of the world\u2019s most comprehensive newsreel archives,\u201d digitized more than 1 million minutes of old news footage. This piece of footage from May 1948 shows a portion of a daredevil show by \u201cJimmie Lynch and His Death Dodgers\u201d at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nThe original clip can be viewed below, as well as a transcription of the announcer\u2019s description of Howe\u2019s act:\n\nNow meet Miss Helen Howe of red Indian descent. In Birmingham, Alabama, she proves its quite possible to be blown out of a cardboard box by dynamite and survive. Very useful in these explosive times. 5 sticks of dynamite are used, so they say. Is she damaged? It looks like it at first. But there\u2019s really no cause for alarm. Helen\u2019s alright. She evidently thrives on concussion.\n\nThe Muncie Evening Press profiled Howe in August 1947. While Howe joked that the hardest part of her job was the traveling, her line of work (getting into a box filled with dynamite and detonated) occasionally led to some serious injuries. The Evening Press reported that Howe was once confined to a wheelchair for six weeks after suffering serious injuries during a stunt:", "lang": "en"}
