The claim is false; the video actually shows an incident during a 2017 by-election in the city of Srinagar.\n\nThe video, which is around 35 seconds long, has been viewed more than 89,000 times in this post published to Facebook April 11, 2019 -- the same day that voting began in the 2019 Indian elections.\n\nHere is an AFP story published April 11 about the opening of the polls.\n\nThe video shows electronic voting machines, or EVMs, being smashed and set on fire by a group of people. Here is an information page about EVMs on the website of India\u2019s election commission.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption says, translated to English: \u201cPolling is on for the first phase of elections in India, polling officials are saying that votes are going in favour of the BJP despite whatever buttons you push. People smashed EVM out of anger.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post, which also contains two stills from the video:\n\nBJP refers to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Here is the party\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nThe video has also been shared elsewhere on Facebook with the same caption, for example in this post also published April 11 and shared nearly 2,000 times since.\n\nIt has also been shared on Facebook here and here, on Twitter here and on YouTube here \u2013 all published on or after April 11 \u2013 alongside similar claims.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex using keyframes from the video obtained using digital verification tool InVid found that the clip was not filmed during the first phase of the 2019 Indian election but is two years old.\n\nThe exact same video was published in this report, dated April 12, 2017, on the website of Indian news channel NDTV.\n\nThe headline says: \u201cIn Srinagar Video From Sunday, Mob Smashes And Burns EVMs; Re-poll Tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the NDTV report, which says 33 EVMs were set on fire:\n\nThe first paragraph of the report says: \u201cFresh polling will be held tomorrow in parts of Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, where a by-election on Sunday saw huge violence as mobs targeted polling booths amid a poll boycott call by separatists.\n\n\u201cThey burned electronic voting machines or EVMs and clashed with security forces in at least 200 incidents of violence. Eight civilians were killed and about 100 security personnel were injured.\u201d\n\nThe violence was also reported on the websites of major Indian dailies, for example here by The Times of India, here by Hindustan Times and here by The Hindu.\n\nBelow is an image comparing screenshots of the video in the misleading Facebook posts (L) and of the video in the media reports from 2017 (R):", "lang": "en"}
