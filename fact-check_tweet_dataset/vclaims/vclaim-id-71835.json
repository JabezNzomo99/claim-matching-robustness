The council is a business-backed organization that writes model legislation for conservative lawmakers to enact in different states.\n\n\"That\u2019s a story that all too often doesn\u2019t get told,\" he said. \"Those 190-something countries that signed on to that Paris Accord, I tell them, \u2018When you catch up with us about reducing emissions, then you come talk to me about joining.\u2019\"\n\nPerry\u2019s claim about energy production and emissions caught our eye. Is it possible that the United States could lead other countries on energy production and lead on reducing emissions?\n\n\"It\u2019s exciting. Any way you slice that first statement, to my understanding, it is absolutely true,\" said Webber, an author and professor who specializes in energy and mechanical engineering. \"The second statement can be true, but boy, there\u2019s a lot of nuance and caveats around this.\"\n\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration for international data on energy production. The EIA is an independent entity within the Department of Energy that produces data on energy use.\n\nEIA spokesman Dennis Mesina declined to comment on Perry\u2019s claim specifically, but provided available data on energy production and emission reductions from countries around the world.\n\nThis increase in demand was seen across the world, with China, the United States and India accounting for the most growth, according to the analysis.\n\nBut EIA administrator Linda Capuano said the nation\u2019s energy industry is entering a \"transformational time\" in testimony before the U.S. House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee in February.\n\nRegardless of this prediction, the latest available data shows that the United States produces more oil and natural gas than other countries, as Perry said.\n\nThe second part of Perry\u2019s claim lacks specifics. He did not offer a baseline for comparison or timeline for his claim \u2014 is he looking at year-to-year emissions reductions? Is he looking at reductions over a five-year period?\n\nWe can look at different time periods to get a sense of progress, looking at shifts in the past five, 10 or 15 years. But we can also look at emission reductions that occurred during the time period in which the United States led on production of oil and gas, as Perry said in his claim. The U.S. has led on natural gas production since 2011, but has led on production of both gas and oil just since last year.\n\n\"The US leads the world in actual energy related emissions reductions by orders of magnitude compared to any other country since 2005,\" Hynes said in a statement. \"Yes-there have been ebbs and flows (as there were during multiple years under the Obama Administration) but the overwhelming trend is downward.\"\n\nHynes is right that, in broad strokes, the United States has reported a downward trend in carbon dioxide emissions that has resulted in more carbon dioxide emissions by volume than other nations. But, there's a bit more context we need to consider.\n\n\"In the end, I think it is true,\" Webber said of Perry\u2019s claim. \"But if I were teaching a class, I\u2019d say that it isn\u2019t that simple and we have more to discuss.\"\n\nUsing these figures we looked at how the United States has reduced emissions over periods of five, ten and fifteen years (using the most current year of 2016) and how the U.S. compares to other countries.\n\u2022 *From 2011 to 2016, the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 273.7 million metric tons, or a 5% reduction.\n\u2022 *From 2006 to 2016, the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 738.6 million metric tons, or a 12.5% reduction.\n\u2022 *From 2001 to 2016, the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 586.9 million metric tons, or a 10% reduction.\n\nDuring each of these time periods, the United States made the largest reduction in million metric tons of carbon dioxide, but dozens of countries made larger reductions in terms of percentage.\n\nAbsolute figures are important to consider, but percentages offer a different perspective when comparing the United States to other nations, since they account for factors like population, economic standing and levels of energy production.\n\nThe EIA has not published emissions data from after 2016, but BP\u2019s 2019 Statistical Review of World Energy includes figures up to 2018, which allows for an analysis of emission reductions since the United States has become a leader on both oil and natural gas production.\n\nAn aside here: BP has a disclaimer that states its data is \"not comparable to official national emissions data,\" but it is considered a reliable resource by industry experts.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2018, when the United States became the leading producer of oil and natural gas, the country saw a 2.6% increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Globally, there was a 2% increase in emissions, the fastest growth the world has seen in seven years, according to the report.\n\nPerry said \"The U.S. now leads the world in producing both oil and natural gas, and at the same time reducing energy-related emissions.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that the United States is the leading producer of both oil and natural gas as of 2018, but the second part of Perry\u2019s claim needs more context.\n\nWhen we step back and look at shifts over the past five, 10 and 15 years, the United States has reduced more total carbon dioxide emissions than other nations, but dozens of others made more reductions in percent-terms.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2018, the United States actually increased its carbon dioxide emissions.", "lang": "en"}
