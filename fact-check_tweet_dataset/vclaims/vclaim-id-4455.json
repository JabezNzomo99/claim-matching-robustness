First, it\u2019s unclear whether he was referring to U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident status (green cards). Second, Zonnour\u2019s claim was that Iranian government officials competed to secure U.S. citizenship or green cards for their children, not for themselves. Trump\u2019s tweet glosses over those important nuances.\n\n\u201cThere are a few Iranians within the ruling establishment who have or had U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, typically dating from the pre-revolutionary period,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThere are also Iranian officials whose children have found their way to U.S. universities and stayed in the U.S., or married dual nationals and obtained residency or citizenship that way.\n\n\u201cGiven the long-standing estrangement between the U.S. and Iran, the allegation alone is used as a smear, to impugn the patriotism and question the motives of rival officials by essentially accusing them of hypocrisy and ideological opportunism. So it\u2019s not surprising that a politician who is critical of the nuclear deal would use this line of attack, especially in the aftermath of President Trump\u2019s dismantling of the deal, which has generated an intense backlash toward the proponents of the agreement.\u201d\n\nIn short, it\u2019s possible that Zonnour, a politician who opposes the Iran deal, was arguing that Rouhani gave away the store and was rewarded by Obama with an offer to give citizenship or green cards to the children of his supporters. After Trump announced the United States was leaving the JCPOA, Zonnour said Iran should resume high-level uranium enrichment unless Rouhani secures \u201cnecessary guarantees\u201d from the remaining countries in the agreement, according to Iranian media.\n\nTwo senior Obama administration officials who had authority over immigration matters told The Fact Checker on the condition of anonymity that they had no knowledge of the Obama administration offering citizenship or green cards to 2,500 Iranians as part of the JCPOA negotiations. Both officials said the claim was highly implausible, since such an offer to Iran would have required high-level authorization, and they had no indication that authorization was requested or given.\n\n\u201cThis is not something that would have been negotiated without it being super public at the time,\u201d one of the officials said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that Iranians were coming to the U.S. as refugees, and they have been for a long time. There are high levels of political and religious persecution in Iran. We may have brought in some refugees that were government officials of some level. But somebody who was a government official would be subject to a very high level of scrutiny and in most cases would be barred from entering because of the connection to the regime.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, U.S. officials granted lawful permanent resident status to 13,114 people born in Iran, and an additional 10,344 Iranian-born people were naturalized, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security. Combining both totals, the United States gave citizenship or legal status to 2,223 more Iranians in 2015 than 2014. But the 2015 figures do not depart significantly from historical trends over the past 10 years, DHS data show.\n\nZonnour estimated that 30 to 40 of the 2,500 people supposedly given citizenship or green cards were studying in the United States, according to the Fars report. He didn\u2019t name anyone. A niece of Rouhani\u2019s lives in the United States, as does a daughter of Ali Larijani, the speaker of the Iranian parliament.\n\nLet\u2019s rewind. This claim from Trump appears to have originated with a hard-line Iranian cleric who opposes the Iran deal. Zonnour gave an interview to an Iranian newspaper, which was then repackaged by Iran\u2019s semiofficial news agency, which was then picked up by U.S. media and then by the president on his Twitter feed (with some of the details garbled).", "lang": "en"}
