A spokesperson for the Biden campaign has confirmed they did not create the ad.\n\nAs the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Biden has become a popular target for misinformation, particularly that which suggests he\u2019s not mentally capable to serve as president. In late March, the Daily Caller debunked an edited video showing Biden perusing books about dementia, for instance.\n\nThis particular Facebook post purportedly shows an ad released by the Biden campaign that states, \u201cHis Brain? No. His heart.\u201d The ad, which has a burst of light emanating from Biden\u2019s heart, also features a disclaimer: \u201cApproved by Joe Biden. Paid for by Biden for President.\u201d\n\nThe ad appears to have been fabricated, despite it being shared widely on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit forums. The Caller didn\u2019t find any credible media outlets reporting that the ad is genuine, and it doesn\u2019t appear anywhere on Biden\u2019s campaign website. There is also no record of it in the Facebook Ad Library.\n\nPhotographer Salwan Georges took the original picture of Biden smiling for the Washington Post at the Iowa State Fair in August 2019.

Twitter has taken down tweets claiming the ad is real for violating the platform\u2019s election rules, according to The Verge.", "lang": "en"}
