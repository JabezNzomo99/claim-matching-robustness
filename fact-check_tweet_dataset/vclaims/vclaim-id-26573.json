Some, like Sky News, reported that voters think violence against MPs is \u201cworth it\u201d to achieve their preferred outcome, while others, like the Guardian, amended its headline to clarify that people think the \u201crisk of violence\u201d is \u201ca price worth paying\u201d.\n\nThis is a very important distinction.\n\nWhile a majority did see violence against MPs as a risk worth taking to achieve their preferred Brexit outcomes, it\u2019s not clear whether a majority also thought that risk was likely.\n\nIt\u2019s plausible that at least some people said the risk of violence is worth it because they think the risk of violence is low, or because the risk is the same whether we leave or remain in the EU.\n\nIt\u2019s irresponsible of Cardiff University to issue a press release which sensationalises and distorts the findings of its research.\n\nThere are also problems with the underlying survey methodology which mean we shouldn\u2019t read too much into the results.\n\nProblems with how the survey was reported\n\nMedia outlets repeated the wording of Cardiff University\u2019s press release: that a majority of voters felt violence against MPs was \u201ca price worth paying\u201d to achieve their preferred Brexit option.\n\nThe survey actually found that 58% of Remain voters agreed with the statement that \u201cI see [violence directed towards MPs] as a risk but it\u2019s worth it to remain in the EU\u201d.\n\n71% of Leave voters agreed with the reverse proposition: \u201cI see [violence directed towards MPs] as a risk but it\u2019s worth it to take back control\u201d.\n\nTolerating the risk of violence towards MPs is different to actively thinking that violence is a price worth paying for your preferred Brexit outcome. You might well think that there is some risk of violence against MPs from your preferred outcome, but that the level of risk is low\u2014making it a risk worth taking.\n\nIndeed, the survey found that 66% of Leave voters thought it was unlikely that violence would be directed towards MPs if we left the EU. Conversely, 39% of Remain voters thought it was unlikely violence would be directed towards MPs if we remained in the EU.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how great a risk of violence respondents are willing to tolerate for their preferred Brexit outcome\u2014because the survey did not ask them.\n\nThe list of possible answers was too simplistic\n\nUltimately, the survey is asking people to weigh up the potential risk of political violence towards MPs, against the potential rewards of a preferred political outcome. This is a complex question.\n\nBut the survey only gave respondents three simplistic answers to choose from:\n\u2022 \u201cI want this to happen regardless of Brexit\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cI see it as a risk but it\u2019s worth it\u201d;\n\u2022 and \u201c[leaving/remaining in the EU] is not worth the risk of this happening\u201d.\n\nThere was no option in the survey for people who don\u2019t see violence against MPs as a risk; or for people who think that there would be a risk of violence regardless of the Brexit outcome.\n\nThis could well be a substantial group of people\u2014as just over half of respondents thought violence against MPs was likely if we leave the EU, and just over half also thought it was likely if we remain. If you think violence is likely no matter what happens with Brexit, and so respond \u201cI see it as a risk but it\u2019s worth it\u201d, it would not be fair to say that this means violence is a price you\u2019re willing to pay for your preferred political outcome. It\u2019s just that there are no other options in the survey that represent your view.\n\nWith a set of options this limited, there is little meaningful that we can extract about how far people are willing to accept the risk of violence against MPs.\n\nOther problems with how the survey was conducted\n\nThe survey wording also downplayed the risk of violence against MPs, and so could have inflated the numbers agreeing that a risk of violence was worth taking.\n\nIn the preamble to the violence question, the survey says \u201cSome have suggested that **leaving the European Union** might present challenges to the UK but others disagree, labelling this as Project Fear.\u201d\n\nMentioning \u201cproject fear\u201d in the question could have an impact on how respondents answer the question. \u201cProject fear\u201d is a trope used frequently by the Leave side of the debate, both during and after the referendum, to indicate a claim that it thinks is false or exaggerated. Including it in the question like this could therefore indicate to a respondent that the \u201cchallenges\u201d that some have suggested are associated with leaving the EU are either false or exaggerated, and this therefore might lower the respondent\u2019s perceived risk of violence.\n\nEmphasis has also been put on the fact that 7% of people said that they want violence against MPs to happen \u201cregardless of Brexit\u201d.\n\nThis is a more concerning answer. But it\u2019s worth noting that in the same survey 5% say they want to get substantially poorer regardless of Brexit, and 11-12% said they want the party they support to lose the next UK general election.\n\nIt suggests the possibility that some people either misunderstood the questions, or perhaps were not answering the survey entirely seriously. Added to the problems above, we should be very wary of over-interpreting the answers.", "lang": "en"}
