It is being claimed that Muslim women caught shopping in the middle of the nationwide lockdown were trying to flee from the police. A Facebook page \u2018Jabir Hayaat Ansari AIMIM\u2019 shared the clip with the caption, \u201cDrama drama and only drama. These women had stepped out for shopping during the lockdown. Police took out the shop owner and locked these women inside the shop.\u201d He has now deleted the tweet however the same caption was used by several other users.\n\nAnother page \u2018Like All Page\u2019 shared it with the following message, \u201ckhawateen shutter bnd kr k shopping kr rhe the, time khtm hva to police ne bahar s seal kr dia, ab khawateen chalang mar rhe h \u2026.. dekheaye.\u201d However, the most widely circulating claim reads, \u201cAaj ki taza khabar yeh aourton ko shopping ke baghair mout ajaty, lock down mein police ne owner ko baher karke showroom ko lock kardiye, lekin yeh ladies ooper store mein chup gayee thein baad mein balcony se tamasha dekho.\u201d Alt News had received multiple fact-check requests that carry the same message.\n\nA shop hoarding \u2013 \u2018Tariq book store\u2019 \u2013 is visible towards the end of the video. A restaurant \u2018Hot N Spicy\u2019 can also be spotted.\n\nAccording to Google maps, Tariq book store is located in Commercial Area Defence V Defence Housing Authority, Karachi, Pakistan. It is right beside Hot N Spicy. As per Google maps, both stores are located in Khadda market.\n\nImages on Google street view further corroborate the exact location where the video was shot.\n\nA keyword search \u2018Khadda market\u2019 on Facebook led us to videos from 2015. One Jibran Waghani from Karachi, Pakistan had shared the same video on June 13, 2015. The clip has 1.8 lakh and over 5,000 shares. He wrote, \u201cFIA chapa (raid) in Khadda market.\u201d FIA stands for Federal Investigation Agency.\n\nA YouTube channel uploaded the video and wrote that sex workers were fleeing after FIA raid at a brothel in Karachi. The same caption was used by video-sharing app Daily Motion which credited the footage to Pakistan media outlet Ary News.\n\nA 5-year-old video from Pakistan is therefore being shared with the false claim that Muslim women were caught shopping during lockdown in India.", "lang": "en"}
