It shows a green-faced Block, along with Gov. Lincoln Chafee, depicted as \"Two Peas in a Pod\" because both \"have been cheerleaders for liberal agendas.\"\n\n\"Both supported Obamacare,\" it asserts, characterizing Block's support in the past tense.\n\nUnlike the television ad, which lists no source for its claim, the flier says the claim is based on Block's on the WPRI-TV show \"Newsmakers.\"\n\nFour minutes into that program, Block states that he has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past, including President Obama in 2012.\n\n\"In 2012, I bought what Barack Obama was selling in terms of changes to health care for me as a small business owner, someone who buys insurance for employees. I can no longer afford to do what we're doing. And I believed that Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, was going to provide the kind of relief that we needed in my business to insure my employees,\" he says.\n\n\"And it turns out that the promise didn't live up to the hype, and I fairly regret the vote,\" Block continued. \"I'm looking for answers and those answers didn't come.\"\n\nIn other words, Block acknowledged in November that he did support the promise of Obamacare, signed into law in March 2010, and Obama's reelection in 2012, but stated that he no longer supports that law.\n\n, the enrollment deadline for Obamacare, Block released a statement, published in The Providence Journal, characterizing it as \"a horrible bill, ill-conceived, unilaterally passed by one party, and terribly implemented.\"\n\nHe said it \"raised taxes and massively disrupted the health insurance market in Rhode Island without increasing competition, access, or affordability.\"\n\nEven if Fung hadn\u2019t seen that story, we know he is aware of Block\u2019s earlier repudiation of Obamacare. That\u2019s because when Fung appeared on \"Newsmakers\" on , moderator Tim White challenged Fung over his internet ad that selectively quoted Block's November \"Newsmaker\" appearance.\n\nHe noted that the Fung ad clipped out Block's phrase, \"The promise didn\u2019t live up to the hype, and I fairly regret the vote.\" Fung said he didn't have a problem with the omission.\n\nDespite this, the \"Blockhead\" commercial says \"Block supports Obamacare,\" asserting that he supports the controversial health care law today.\n\nWhen the Fung campaign got back to us, spokesmen Patrick Sweeney and Robert Coupe argued that it is accurate to say that Block supports Obamacare today because Block has never called for repeal of the law, as other opponents have and has never formally revoked the support he acknowledged in the November \"Newsmakers\" appearance.\n\nOn the latter point, we disagree. Block has repeatedly made it clear he no longer supports Obamacare. The very \"Newsmakers\" appearance the Fung campaign cites in its attack on Block shows that.\n\nIn light of all the evidence, it is clear that Fung is making a ridiculously blockheaded claim.
