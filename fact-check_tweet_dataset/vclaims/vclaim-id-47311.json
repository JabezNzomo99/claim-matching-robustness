No, that's not true: the screenshot of the tweet is a forgery spread in conspiracy groups on Facebook and via a fake Fox News Twitter account that has since been suspended. While Omar is opposed to war with Iran, she did not call for world leaders to rise up or incite violence to stop it.\n\nAn example of the fake tweet could be seen on Instagram here (archived here). The text in the fake tweet read:\n\nThis is what the false tweet looked like:\n\nThe fake tweet appears to have been created by modifying the text in this real tweet (archived here):\n\nThe date, image and parts of the text seem to match perfectly.\n\nThe hoax appears to have been first reported on by Alex Kaplan on Twitter:\n\nThe fake Fox News account @FoxNewsChanUS on Twitter already appears to have been taken down, but the faked tweet can still be found here via archive.is. Note the lack of a blue checkmark next to the account name, indicating the account was not verified:\n\nWhen it comes to screenshots of inflammatory tweets by political figures, it is usually best to check if they actually tweeted them before sharing the screenshot. Even better, share the original tweet instead, so people can check for themselves.", "lang": "en"}
