But what did these things actually cost?", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-33233", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/meme-on-government-spending/", "vclaim": "How much of this meme on government spending is true?\n\nThis tweet on various types of government spending has been shared over 5,000 times on Facebook and 3,000 times on Twitter.\n\nMost of the claims are roughly correct, as we\u2019ve summarised here.\n\nOf course, these particular figures have been picked to make a political point\u2014they cover different time periods, come from different departmental budgets, and most are total rather than per person costs.\n\nRoyal weddings are primarily paid for by the Royal Family, but the security costs are met by public funding.\n\nEstimates for the cost of policing past royal weddings have ranged from between \u00a32 million and \u00a36 million. \u00a32 million was at the lower end of a reported estimate from Thames Valley\u2019s Police and Crime Commissioner for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s nuptials earlier this year. We don\u2019t know for sure exactly how much the policing cost, or how much it will cost to police Princess Eugenie\u2019s upcoming wedding.\n\nThe higher figure of \u00a36 million is from a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the Metropolitan Police on the cost of the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. This included overtime pay for the police because the 2011 wedding was declared a bank holiday\u2014something that hasn\u2019t happened for either royal wedding this year.\n\nSince the tweet was written, the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, Sara Thornton, has said an \u201cearly estimate\u201d of the \u201cfull cost of the operation\u201d is \u00a318 million, although it\u2019s still being worked out. She said nearly every force supported the operation in some way, with nearly 10,000 officers deployed from across the country, who performed over 26,000 shifts.\n\nThe Police Chief\u2019s Council told us the estimate was based on the entire operation, so includes \u201call contingency planning, mutual aid, policing of protests, and security operations across all force areas affected in both England and Scotland throughout his entire trip\u201d. Mutual aid is when police forces help each other during large events or incidents.\n\nBefore the visit the government said it would provide up to \u00a35 million to cover policing costs for the Scottish portion of Mr Trump\u2019s visit.\n\nA cost of \u00a32.8 million to the Metropolitan Police was the most up to date estimate from the police at the time the tweet was written.\n\nThe Mirror reported that in response to an FOI request, the Metropolitan Police told them it had cost around \u00a32.87 million to police Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the UK. This did not cover his trips to Blenheim Palace or his Scottish golf course, or the protests in London in response to his visit.\n\nThe Conservative party have a confidence and supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party, in which they agree to \u201csupport the government on all motions of confidence\u201d. We\u2019ve written more about how this works here.\n\nIn return the government promised them \u00a31 billion\u2019s worth of funding for different areas in Northern Ireland. Some of that money is promised over several years.\n\nThe cost of \u201creservicing\u201d Buckingham Palace is an estimated \u00a3369 million spread over ten years. But exactly how this is paid for is a little more complicated.\n\nThe Crown Estate is land and assets owned by the monarchy. Profits from the Crown Estate (like rent) are handed to the Treasury (\u00a32.7 billion over the last ten years). The Treasury keeps most and gives the rest, called the Sovereign Grant, to the Queen.\n\nThe proportion given back to the Queen increased from 15% a year to 25% from 2017/18, with the extra 10% going towards funding the palace\u2019s renovation over the next ten years (so less money will go to the Treasury). We\u2019ve looked more at this issue in a previous factcheck.\n\nPersonal Independence Payment (PIP) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) are types of benefits that some ill and disabled people are entitled to.\n\nThe Mirror reported that the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 (DWP) spent \u00a3199 million over five years between 2013/14 and 2017/18 on the direct operating costs of mandatory reconsiderations and appeal tribunals for people challenging a decision on their claim for PIP and ESA.\n\nIf the DWP initially declares claimants of these benefits \u2018fit to work\u2019 during their work capability assessment, they are entitled to appeal the decision, first via a mandatory reconsideration and if the decision is appealed again, via a tribunal. So it is more accurate to say these costs are incurred by the DWP processing and contesting appeals, rather than \u2018stopping\u2019 them.\n\nJust looking at mandatory reconsiderations, there have been 310,000 registered for ESA and 780,900 for PIP since 2013 .\n\nThe DWP told the Mirror that the figures were internal snapshots rather than official statistics, and \u201cshould be treated with caution\u201d. The Mirror published their findings at the bottom of their article here.\n\nWhen asked about the cost of HS2 in 2018, the government said that at the 2015 spending review it had \u201crestated the long-term Funding Envelope for delivery of the full HS2 scheme of \u00a355.73bn\u201d, which is in 2015 prices.\n\nA House of Commons briefing looked at what had already been spent, based on a statement by ministers and figures from the HS2 business plan. It said that the cost to date was around \u00a34.1 billion\u2014if the two figures didn\u2019t overlap \u201cwhich it is not possible to assume with certainty\u201d. It said anticipated future spending to 2021 would be \u00a312 billion.\n\nTrident is the UK\u2019s submarine-based system of nuclear weapons which includes four submarines and a number of missiles and warheads. Trident became operational in 1994 replacing another submarine-based system, Polaris. Annual in-service costs are estimated to be around \u00a32.2 billion (6% of the defence budget), according to the House of Commons Library.\n\nThe latest estimate (from 2015) of designing and manufacturing replacement submarines is \u00a331 billion, with another \u00a310 billion to cover any extra costs or spending beyond that. But there are other costs associated with Trident, like decommissioning old nuclear weapons and the in-service costs.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict the future in-service costs of new models as this is based on a number of things like how much future governments will decide to spend on defence and the state of the UK economy going forward. The House of Commons Library suggests that cost projections could range from \u00a370 billion to \u00a3150 billion (between 2031/32 and 2061/62) depending on what method is used.\n\nThere were reports in 2017 that a \u00a344,000 bathroom was being built at the new offices of the (then-named) Department of Health. The Sun, which originally reported the story, said the then-health minister Jeremy Hunt had \u201chad a \u00a344,000 taxpayer-funded toilet and shower suite put in his new office.\u201d\n\nJeremy Hunt called the Sun\u2019s story \u201ctotally false\u201d, adding that he had requested a shower for long distance cyclists in their new office, but that the bathroom was not for his own personal use, as his short commute didn\u2019t demand it.\n\nHe did not refer to the bathroom\u2019s cost.\n\n\u00a330 less per week for some disabled people\n\nPeople on ESA who are ill or disabled are split into two groups after they have their work capability assessment: a work-related activity group, where they have interviews with an advisor, or a support group, where there are no interviews.\n\nBefore April 2017 ESA was \u00a373.10 a week, plus an extra component of between \u00a330 and \u00a340 depending on the group claimants were in.\n\nThe government forecast at the 2016 budget that these changes would save \u00a3180 million a year by 2018/19, reaching \u00a3450 million a year by 2020/21 . Between 2017/18 and 2020/21 these forecast savings would theoretically amount to over \u00a31 billion.\n\nFrom April 2017 new ESA claimants in the work-related activity group (and those getting the equivalent element in Universal Credit) no longer received the extra \u00a330. This brings the level of the payment to the same amount received by those on Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance.\n\nThe 2015 Summer Budget said that the system before the change \u201c[created] a financial incentive to claim sickness benefits over Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\u201d and that the change would \u201censure the right incentives and support are in place for those closer to the labour market to help them make this transition when they are ready.\u201d This has been disputed by charities working with people with disabilities.", "lang": "en"}
