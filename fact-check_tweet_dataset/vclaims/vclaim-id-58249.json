It is being claimed that the photo shows Bill Gates and Dr Anthony Fauci violating the social distancing norms.\n\nThe photo also has a text that reads \"NO SOCIAL DISTANCING OR MASKS FOR THESE TWO DEMONS WHO ARE SHUTTING DOWN AN ENTIRE PLANET.\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim with the photo to be misleading. The picture was taken in December 2018 and has nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nVarious social media users have shared this photo with different captions. One of the captions of reads \"If any \"authority\" stop you for not wearing masks just showed this picture to them\".

The workshop took place on December 11, 2018, in Bethesda, MD\".\n\nThe original picture shows Bill Gates, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr Francis Collins, NIH director.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci is also a member of the White House coronavirus task force. Recently, three members of the White House coronavirus task force including Dr Fauci placed themselves in self- isolation after possible exposure to Covid-19.
