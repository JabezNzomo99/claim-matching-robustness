The posts claim the image is evidence of price gouging under the current government in Pakistan. The claim is misleading; both boxes show a manufacture date that predates the current government; the pharmaceutical company which produces the drug seen in the image said the higher price tag had been doctored.\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook here on July 18, 2020. It was shared more than 7,200 times before it was deleted.\n\nThe post\u2019s Urdu-language caption translates as: \u201c\u201cLook at the atrocity of PTI folks\u201d.\n\nPTI is acronym for the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf political party, which is headed by Prime Minister Imran Khan and came into power in August 2018.\n\nThe post also contains an image of two boxes of Nuberol Forte, a painkiller and muscle relaxant. One box bears a manufacturing date of June 19, 2018 and is priced at 79.20 rupees (USD 0.47). The other box is marked with a date of June 6, 2018 and is priced at 426 rupees (USD 2.50).\n\nBelow is a magnified cross section of the photo to show the printed information clearly:\n\nThe same photo was also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here and on Twitter here and here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nThe manufacturing date stamp on the boxes -- June 2018 -- predate the current PTI administration, which came into office in August 2018.\n\nA sales officer for Searle, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Nuberol Forte, also said that the photo had been digitally manipulated.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that Nuberol Forte was never priced 426 rupees,\u201d the officer, Tahir Mubeen, told AFP by telephone on July 21, 2020. \u201cThe price info on the box has been doctored. We keep on seeing such fake news on social media and are aware of it.\u201d\n\nPrices of a particular drug are regulated by the government across Pakistan.
