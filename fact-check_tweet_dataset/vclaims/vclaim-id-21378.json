Literally, everything!\u201d\n\nThe photo does show a coastal town devastated by a hurricane, but it is actually Mexico Beach, Florida, in the wake of Hurricane Michael in 2018.\n\nHurricane Dorian has been moving northward toward the U.S. after stalling over the Bahamas, reported The New York Times.\n\nThe slow-moving storm battered the Bahamas with high winds and floodwaters for more than a day, killing at least seven people, according to CNN. It was a Category 5 hurricane over the weekend, but has since been downgraded to Category 2 (at the time of publication).\n\nSome conveyed their sympathies regarding the situation, with numerous people sharing the alleged picture on Facebook.\n\nThe image does not, however, depict the Abaco Islands town of Marsh Harbour in the Bahamas. Taken by Getty photographer Joe Raedle, it shows the damage caused by Hurricane Michael in Mexico Beach, Florida, in 2018, according to the caption.\n\n\u201cThe aftermath of hurricane Michael is seen on October 17, 2018 in Mexico Beach, Florida,\u201d reads the Getty Images caption. \u201cThe hurricane hit on October 10th along the Florida Panhandle as a category 4 storm causing massive damage and claimed the lives of more then [sic] a dozen people.\u201d\n\nHurricane Michael was the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States since 1992 and the strongest on record to ever hit the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
