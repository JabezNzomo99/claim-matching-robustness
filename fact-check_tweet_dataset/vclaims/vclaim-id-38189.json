According to the tweet, the incident took place in the \u201cGopalganj district where the girl was attacked by a Muslim man.\u201d\n\nWe ran a search and found that this incident was falsely given a communal angle. In a Dainik Jagran report, dated Oct 11, 2018, the attacker was identified as Sandeep Giri.\n\nOn putting the image through Reverse image search, we found the 3rd images on a YouTube video dated May 2019.
