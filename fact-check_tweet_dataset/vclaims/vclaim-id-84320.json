The claim is false; the video actually shows an incident that took place in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nThe video, which shows a car smashing into a row of parked motorcycles in a tunnel, was uploaded in this Facebook post on June 15, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 147,000 times and shared more than 4,300 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\n\n\nTuas refers to a location in the west of Singapore. There is a highway in the area called the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link, which connects the neighbouring country Malaysia to Singapore.\n\nAnother similar Facebook post here also claims that the video shows an accident in Singapore.\n\nThe video footage does not show an accident in Singapore \u2013 the incident happened in Thailand.\n\nThe video, which appears to be CCTV footage, contains a date and timestamp in the top left-hand corner, which indicates that the accident occurred on June 13, 2019 at 6.09 pm.\n\nThe exact same video was posted in this Thai-language report by Chiang Mai News dated June 14, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe title of the article and the video translates as: \u201cThis clip shows the second when the accident happened inside the tunnel under Fa Ham, in Chiang Mai. The car lost control and hit the motorcycle, which was parked to avoid rain.\u201d\n\nFa Ham is a sub-district of Chiang Mai, a city in northern Thailand; it is located here on Google Maps.\n\nEmbedded below is the video clip from the Chiang Mai News report:\n\nGoogle reverse image searches using keyframes from the video led to other Thai media reports, for example here in The Thaiger.\n\nThese reports all say the accident occurred at the Fa Ham, or Fa Harm, Underpass on the Super Highway in Chiang Mai.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Thaiger report:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video (L) and a picture in that news report (R):\n\nThe location of the accident as given by the Thai news reports is here on Google Maps.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of one of the pictures from the news report (L) and the location as seen on Google Maps (R), with the similar features circled in red:", "lang": "en"}
