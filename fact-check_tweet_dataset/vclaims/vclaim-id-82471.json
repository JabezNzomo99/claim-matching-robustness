Out this, the top 20 pages alone spent more than Rs 1.1 crore. Coming in second to \u2018My First Vote For Modi\u2019 was pro-YSR Congress ads by the political advocacy group \u2018Indian Political Action Committee\u2019 (Rs 17.52 lakh), followed by the page dedicated to BJP\u2019s election campaign \u2018Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat\u2019 (Rs 9.68 lakh).\n\nThe table below shows the expenditure incurred by the highest-spending 20 pages between March 17 to 23 and compares the same with the previous week\u2019s spending. Between March 10 to 16, \u2018Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat\u2019 was the top spender with an expenditure of over Rs 27 lakh. This week, the page\u2019s spending was brought down by Rs 17 lakh and the expenditure of \u2018My First Vote For Modi\u2019 increased by over Rs 31 lakh.\n\nSimilarly, the expenditure of another pro-BJP Facebook page \u2018Nation with NaMo\u2019 which stood in the second place last week (Rs Rs 17.7 lakh), was reduced by over Rs 11 lakh.\n\nIn total, pro-BJP pages incurred an expenditure of Rs 67 lakh, followed by pro-YSR Congress ads (Rs 24 lakh), pro-BJD ads (Rs 10.5 lakh) and pro-Congress ads (Rs 8 lakh).\n\nPro-BJP pages lure social media users with freebies to vote for the party\n\nFacebook\u2019s ad library data allows users to examine the nature of political ads sponsored by a certain page. Alt News discovered that \u2018My First Vote For Modi\u2019, developed three months prior to the coming elections, is luring voters with \u201cattractive goodies\u201d against a pledge to vote for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The range of goodies offered by the page is badges, bags, T-shirts, phone covers, caps, etc. \u201cPledge your first vote for PM Modi for the better India and win exciting goodies,\u201d read the ads.\n\nIncidentally, all of these products are available for sale on the official website of PM Modi as part of \u2018NaMo merchandise.\u2019\n\nIn fact, the Prime Minister himself advertised some of the same products from his Twitter handle.\n\nAnother pro-BJP page that also offers \u2018goodies\u2019 to voters against a pledge to vote for PM Modi is \u2018Nation with NaMo\u2019.\n\n\u2018Nation with NaMo\u2018 and \u2018My First Vote For Modi\u2019 are a part and parcel of the same brand, as evident from the collage above. The ad carries the logo of \u2018My First Vote For Modi\u2019.\n\nOur earlier report brought to light the fact that the address mentioned by both \u2018Nation with NaMo\u2019 and \u2018My First Vote For Modi\u2019 as part of advertiser details, matched the address of BJP Delhi headquarters.\n\nThe BJP, however, is yet to declare direct links with these pages, which begs the question of who funds them when the combined investment by both the pages since February 2019 stands at nearly Rs 1.8 crore.\n\nBut a matter of bigger concern is the veiled bribing of voters. Both the pages offer \u2018attractive prizes\u2019 and \u2018goodies\u2019 in the form of NaMo merchandise to anyone pledging to vote for PM Modi.\n\nSpeaking to Alt News, former Chief of Election Commission TS Krishnamurthy said, \u201cUnder the Representation of the People Act, you are not supposed to influence voters with any offers. It must be examined under the Act whether the voters are being influenced by undue influencers.\u201d\n\nA plethora of unresolved questions can only be answered via an enquiry by the Election Commission of India.\n\n1. Is the BJP or people associated with the party pumping money into proxy Facebook pages that influence voters by luring them with freebies?\n\n2. Is the Election Commission aware of the practice?\n\n3. Has the EC looked into the source of investment of these pages and whether the same is a part of BJP\u2019s declared election expenditure?", "lang": "en"}
