Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The school teacher was beating only the Hindu children. Fact: In the video, it can be clearly observed that the teacher was looking downwards towards the shoes. Only those children who didn\u2019t have proper school shoes were beaten. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe video posted on Facebook is not only being shared as \u201cHindus being targeted\u201d but also is being shared as \u201cStudents not wearing the hijab were punished\u201d.\n\nIf the video posted on Facebook is clearly watched, one can come to the conclusion that only students with no proper school shoes were punished by the teacher. In the video, it can be seen that the teacher has his head looking downwards and was watching the shoes of the students. Also, one of the first students to get beaten up is a boy and there is no requirement for him to wear a hijab, so the claim of teacher beating only little girls not wearing a hijab is false. Only those students who didn\u2019t have proper school shoes were beaten, but not the basis of religion or hijab. This article is not to debate whether a teacher can beat students for such things, but to fact check the false claims. So, the claims made about the video on Facebook are FALSE.\n\nFinally, students were beaten based on their shoes, not on the basis of religion or hijab.", "lang": "en"}
