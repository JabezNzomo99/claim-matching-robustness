The tome was compiled by Roman gourmand Marcus Gavius Aspicius in the late 4th or early 5th century AD and lists brains as an ingredient for sausages, stews and puddings.\n\nAround the world, brains and other offal remain on the menu even if their profile has slipped in Australian and many western diets.\n\nBrains found their way onto the plates of Australian households as far back as the 1800s. Edward Abbott\u2019s The English and Australian Cookery Book, originally published in 1864, lists recipes such as a Slippery Bob, comprised of kangaroo brains, flour, pepper and emu fat. The book describes the dish as \u201cbush fare\u201d, requiring \u201ca good appetite and excellent digestion\u201d.\n\nSome Australians may have been served crumbed brains during their childhood and the offal recently made a mainstream comeback of sorts\n\nThe Facebook post shows an image of canned brains purportedly bearing the Heinz brand with the caption stating: \u201cCanned in Australia (1980s)\u201d.\n\nAAP FactCheck contacted global food group Kraft Heinz, owner of the Heinz brand, about the post.\n\nA spokesperson for Kraft Heinz responded in an email that the post did not look genuine.\n\n\u201cWe do not have any record of this product, and the representation of the Heinz logo does not accord with any of our registered trademarks, past or present,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson told AAP FactCheck that as far as the company was aware it had never sold canned brains in Australia.\n\n\u201cA check was carried out on a database of Heinz products in Australia and it didn\u2019t appear there,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAAP FactCheck conducted a reverse image search on the photo and found three results linked to the website picclick.co.uk. The earliest example was dated May 29, 2018. The site displays the photo as part of an Ebay auction item from a vendor called Starporium and the product title reads: \u201cVintage Heinz Canned Brains Infant Food Zombie Australia Real\u201d.\n\nAAP FactCheck sought comment from the Ebay user regarding the origin of the image but received no response at the time of publication.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be false. According to a Kraft Heinz spokesperson, there is no record of a Heinz-branded canned brains product being sold in Australia. In addition, Kraft Heinz said the Heinz logo appearing on the can does not match past or present registered trademarks of the the company.
