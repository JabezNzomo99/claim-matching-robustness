That\u2019s a gross exaggeration.\n\nMiller cited an analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies that covered alleged terror cases from Sept. 12, 2001, through Dec. 31, 2014. We reviewed the convictions of all 72 people included on the list, and here is what we found:\n\u2022 Most \u2014 44 of the 72 people \u2014 were not convicted on terrorism charges. Many were swept up in terrorism investigations, but investigators failed to provide evidence of terrorism-related crimes. Prosecutors instead filed fraud, immigration and other lesser charges. One of the 44 had his conviction overturned on appeal.\n\u2022 More than a third \u2014 28 of the 72 \u2014 were convicted of terrorism crimes or pleaded guilty to terrorism-related activity. The vast majority of these people were convicted of helping to finance terrorism outside the U.S. Only three of the 28 were convicted of plotting acts of terrorism on U.S. soil, and two of them were sting operations.\n\u2022 Four of the 72 were arrested in foreign countries and extradited to the United States for prosecution. Three of the four were convicted on terrorism charges. None of the four would have been blocked by Trump\u2019s travel ban, since they were not attempting to enter the U.S. In fact, three of the four, including a Dutch citizen, were arrested in countries (Spain, Romania and the Netherlands) that were not covered by the travel ban.\n\nNone of the 72 people was responsible for any terrorist-related deaths in the U.S. \u2014 even though roughly 1 million citizens of the seven countries came to the U.S. during this time as refugees, immigrants or on nonimmigrant visas, according to our review of State Department data.\n\nMiller appeared on several Sunday talk shows on Feb. 12 and discussed, among other things, the president\u2019s executive order \u2014 Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States. The order imposes a 90-day travel ban on the citizens of seven predominately Muslim countries (Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen). It also indefinitely prohibits Syrian refugees from entering the U.S., and suspends the refugee program for citizens of all other countries for 120 days.\n\nU.S. District Judge James L. Robart on Feb. 3 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked portions of Trump\u2019s order from taking effect, pending his full consideration of a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota seeking to permanently block Trump\u2019s order. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Feb. 9 unanimously denied the Trump administration\u2019s emergency motion to lift Robart\u2019s temporary order.\n\n\u201cThe Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,\u201d the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said.\n\nAs a result of the court decisions, refugees approved for resettlement in the U.S. and visa holders of the seven countries can travel to the U.S., pending further action by the administration or the courts.\n\nIn defense of the temporary travel ban, top White House officials have cited terrorism attacks that never happened. Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, spoke of the \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d and White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeatedly listed \u201cAtlanta\u201d among the sites of U.S. terror attacks. (We did not write about those incidents, because both acknowledged their mistakes. We try not to play gotcha here at FactCheck.org.)\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Miller also defended the president\u2019s travel ban, and criticized the court decisions. Host Chuck Todd asked Miller why the administration\u2019s travel ban does not include citizens from countries that have a history of committing terrorism in the U.S., such as Saudi Arabia.\n\nMiller made a similar statement on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that same day.\n\nThe Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group for low immigration, posted a blog item on Feb. 11 that said \u201c72 individuals from the seven countries covered in President Trump\u2019s vetting executive order have been convicted in terror cases since the 9/11 attacks.\u201d CIS extracted the 72 names from a larger list of foreign-born suspected terrorists compiled by the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s subcommittee on immigration.\n\nWe reviewed the CIS list and found that not all 72 individuals from the seven countries covered by Trump\u2019s travel ban were convicted of terrorism charges.\n\nMost of the 72 individuals referenced by Miller were not convicted on terrorism charges. Many of them were caught up in terrorism investigations in the days following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but were either never charged or not convicted of terrorism.\n\nFor example, CIS listed 19 Iraqis convicted in terror cases. But we found that only three Iraqis were convicted on terrorism charges. Most \u2014 11 of the 19 \u2014 were part of a terrorism investigation in Pittsburgh that ended up as a simple fraud case that had nothing to do with terrorism.\n\nIn the Pittsburgh case, Kamel Albred, Haider Alshomary, Haider Al-Tamimi, Ali Alubeidy, Alawi Al-Baraa, Mustafa Al-Aboody, Mohammed Alibrahimi (a cousin of Ali Alubeidy), Fadhil Al-Khaledy, Hatef Al-Atabi, Wathek Al-Atabi and Elmeliani Benmoumen were among 20 people arrested in the days following the 9/11 attacks on charges they illegally obtained commercial driver\u2019s licenses and hazmat transportation permits, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Federal prosecutors feared that the men obtained the licenses in order to transport hazardous materials across the country to carry out terrorist attacks, the Post-Gazette wrote.\n\nWhen one of the defendants, Alawi Al-Baraa, pleaded guilty to illegally obtaining a hazmat license by bribing a state official, the Post-Gazette wrote, U.S. District Judge Robert Cindrich \u201ctook the unusual step\u201d at the hearing of asking the federal prosecutor to make clear that Al-Baraa\u2019s case had nothing to do with terrorism.\n\nNearly four years later, the Washington Post wrote a story about the Pittsburgh case \u2014 \u201cThe Terrorism Case That Wasn\u2019t \u2014 and Still Is\u201d \u2014 that quoted Cindrich as saying that he would \u201cnot continue to characterize this as a successful prosecution of a terrorism case, because it was not.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, CIS identified 19 Yemeni citizens on its list of 72 individuals \u201cconvicted in terror cases,\u201d but we found only four who were convicted on terrorism charges. Most of them \u2014 10 \u2014 were initially suspected of funneling money to terrorists through illegal money transfers, but the investigations failed to support terrorism charges.\n\nFor example, federal authorities grew suspicious of a check-cashing business in California and set up a sting operation that resulted in the March 2007 arrests of three Yemen-born men, Yehia Ali Ahmed Alomari, Mohamed Al Huraibi and Saleh Mohamed Taher Saeed. The men agreed to arrange illegal overseas transfers of more than $100,000 for an undercover agent who allegedly \u201ctold the men that some of the money would go to Hezbollah, an organization linked to terrorism,\u201d according to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.\n\nHowever, the paper wrote, \u201cU.S. District Judge Charles Siragusa did not allow mention of Hezbollah during the trial because the criminal charges the men faced had no connection to terrorism.\u201d Ultimately, the three each pleaded guilty to operating an illegal money-transmitting business \u2014 an outcome \u201cauthorities contended\u201d was \u201cfair, given the government\u2019s evidence,\u201d the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle wrote. The paper said that one of the jurors told the men, \u201cI hope you go and have a good life.\u201d\n\nLike the Pittsburgh case we mentioned earlier, several of the terrorist investigations were launched in the days following the 9/11 attacks but terrorism charges failed to materialize:\n\u2022 Mustafa Kilfat and his father were stopped while driving in New Jersey because they were \u201cdriving a red Pontiac \u2014 a car law enforcement officials briefly believed was connected to the attacks\u201d on Sept. 11, 2001, according to the New York Daily News. The two men had no connection to the 9/11 attacks, but Kilfat \u2014 a Syrian citizen \u2014 was convicted on one count of visa fraud.\n\u2022 Nageeb Abdul Jabar Mohamed Al-Hadi was arrested in Toronto in the hours immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He was bound for Chicago using a false name, carrying three Yemeni passports and two Lufthansa uniforms, according to the Chicago Tribune. \u201cA prosecutor in the case said Al-Hadi provided the false information because he didn\u2019t think he would be allowed to re-enter the United States, after abandoning the legal status that he had obtained here in the 1980s through a sham marriage,\u201d the paper wrote. Al-Hadi was convicted on one count of visa fraud.\n\u2022 Mohamed Abdi, a Somalian living in Virginia, was arrested in the days soon after the 9/11 attacks because authorities found his name and phone number written on a Washington street map inside a 1988 Toyota registered to Nawaf al Hazmi, one of the 9/11 hijackers who crashed into the Pentagon, according to CNN and the Chicago Tribune. But, as the Washington Post later reported, \u201cauthorities were unable to find any connection to terrorism.\u201d Abdi pleaded guilty to forging rental subsidy checks.\n\u2022 Mohammed Refai became a suspect shortly after the 9/11 attacks when \u201cfederal investigators in Arkansas found documents that appeared to connect one of the terrorist hijackers, Saeed Alghamdi, with an apartment complex in Akron, Ohio,\u201d the New York Times wrote. Refai lived in the complex. \u201cAccording to newspaper accounts, investigators apparently have decided that the documents from Arkansas involved a case of mistaken identity,\u201d the Times wrote.\n\nOther examples of terror investigations that did not result in terrorism convictions, but were among the 72 cited by Miller:\n\u2022 Mohamed Hussein, a Somalian businessman living in Massachusetts, was \u201csuspected of diverting money to the al-Qaeda network,\u201d according to the Agence France Presse, but was convicted on two counts of illegal money transfers. Prosecutors presented no evidence linking Hussein to terrorists. U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton sentenced Hussein to 18 months, rather than the five years sought by prosecutors. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to ask me to sentence him as a terrorist,\u201d Keeton told a prosecutor. \u201cIt shocks my conscience that I would even be asked to do that.\u201d (Note: Hussein\u2019s name was misspelled on the CIS list as \u201cMohammed Husssein.\u201d)\n\u2022 Pirouz Sedaghaty, who goes by the name of Pete Seda, was convicted in 2010 of two felonies related to his charity, the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation. Federal prosecutors accused Seda of using his organization \u201cto send nearly $150,000 to support religious extremist militants in Chechnya,\u201d according to the Justice Department. But he faced no terrorism charges and his conviction was overturned on appeal by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. \u201cThis is a tax fraud case that was transformed into a trial on terrorism,\u201d Circuit Judge M. Margaret McKeown wrote in the court opinion.\n\nOf course, some citizens of the seven countries covered by Trump\u2019s ban were convicted on terrorism charges. In all, there were 28 individuals who were either convicted on terrorism charges (25) or admitted to terrorism activity (three) in pleading guilty to lesser charges.\n\nOf those 28, however, three arrests occurred abroad, and the suspects were extradited to the United States. None of them were trying to enter the U.S., so they would not have been blocked by Trump\u2019s travel ban. Like Osama bin Laden, they were plotting attacks from other countries.\n\nFor example, Syrian arms dealer Monzer Al Kassar was extradited from Spain and later convicted on charges of conspiring to sell millions of dollars worth of high-powered weapons to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, to be used to kill Americans in Colombia, according to the New York Times.\n\nAl Kassar was convicted of, among other things, providing material support to terrorists. That was true for most of the terrorism convictions, and many of them were Somalian citizens living in the U.S. In all, there were 14 Somalians convicted of helping to finance terrorism abroad, typically for al-Shabaab \u2014 a terrorist group operating in East Africa whose leaders are affiliated with al Qaeda, according to the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\nThere were only three cases during this time in which foreign-born residents of the seven countries on Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban attempted to carry out a terrorist attack in the U.S. \u2014 two of which were not real attacks, but rather government sting operations:\n\u2022 Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia who lived in Oregon, was charged in an undercover sting operation with attempting to set off a fake bomb supplied by undercover FBI agents at a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in Portland. He was sentenced in October 2014 to 30 years in prison.\n\u2022 Yassin Aref, a Kurdish refugee from Iraq, was convicted in a counterterrorism sting operation in 2006. According to the New York Times and the Albany Times Union, an undercover federal agent told Mohammed M. Hossain, Aref\u2019s co-defendant, that he planned to assassinate the Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. in New York City and then sell the weapon for $50,000. The undercover agent offered to give Hossain a $50,000 loan for improvements to his pizza shop. \u201cAccording to testimony, Mr. Hossain asked Mr. Aref to attend another meeting with the informant to act, by Muslim custom, as a witness to the loan,\u201d the New York Times wrote.\n\u2022 Mansour J. Arbabsiar, an Iranian American living in Texas, was convicted on charges of \u201cplotting to hire assassins from a Mexican drug cartel to murder Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador to the United States,\u201d according to the New York Times. He pleaded guilty to \u201cconspiracy to commit an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries and two counts related to murder-for-hire,\u201d the Times said.\n\nTo sum up, we found 28, or more than a third, of the 72 people cited by Miller were convicted on terrorism charges. We found that 25 of the 28 people were in the U.S., when they were arrested. Only three of 25 were implicated in plotting a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, and only one of those was aimed at U.S. citizens on U.S. soil \u2014 a government sting operation, not an actual attack.\n\nNone of the U.S. residents from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen were responsible for any attacks on U.S. soil that resulted in a loss of life. At the same time, roughly 956,000 citizens of those countries entered the U.S. as refugees and visa holders, according to State Department data.\n\nA total of 258,508 refugees from the seven countries resettled in the U.S. from Sept. 12, 2001, to Dec. 31, 2014. Another 697,113 others obtained immigration and nonimmigration visas in fiscal years 2002 through 2014, which covers Oct. 1, 2001, to Sept. 30, 2014.\n\nHere is the breakdown, by country:\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: We obtained refugee data from the State Department\u2019s Refugee Processing Center, and the visa holder data from the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs. Our analysis of the Center for Immigration Studies list of 72 \u201cterror cases\u201d can be found in a spreadsheet that you can download here. FactCheck.org added the last three columns to the spreadsheet, which otherwise remains as it appears on the CIS website.
