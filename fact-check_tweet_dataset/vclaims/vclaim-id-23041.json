The image has been doctored from an original in which the fruit appears green. A new durian variety called Blackthorn does exist, but it is not black in colour.\n\nThe photo was published in this Facebook post on June 3, 2019 by a page called \u201cSingapore Incidents\u201d, which has more than 96,000 followers.\n\nThe photo, which has been shared more than 85 times, shows four durian fruit with black husks, alongside a caption that states: \u201cNew durian species, Blackthorn\u201d.\n\nDurian is a pungent tropical fruit grown in Southeast Asia; here is a dictionary definition.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Chinese characters in the caption translate to English as \"Blackthorn\". Blackthorn is a new variety of durian fruit with its own website, blackthorndurian.com. The variety of durian is green in colour.\n\nThe same photo was published here on Facebook with an identical claim. It was also published here on Twitter with an identical claim.\n\nThe image in the misleading post has been doctored; a reverse image search on Google found a similar photo in this article published on June 4, 2016, on the website of Malaysian Chinese newspaper Nanyang Siang Pau.\n\nThe photo in the article is almost identical to the image in the misleading post, but it shows the durians with green outer shells, not black.\n\nSome other elements are different in the two photos; for example, there is a light blue string hanging from the tree in the original image which does not appear in the misleading Facebook post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading Facebook post (L) with the photo published in the 2016 article (R):\n\nThe Blackthorn variety\u2019s website states here that the new fruit variety was created in Penang, Malaysia.\n\nThe site also contains multiple pictures of blackthorn durians, which are not black-skinned as claimed.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the site\u2019s photo gallery page. The \u201cmatured fruiting trees\u201d section shows the variety with its green husk.", "lang": "en"}
