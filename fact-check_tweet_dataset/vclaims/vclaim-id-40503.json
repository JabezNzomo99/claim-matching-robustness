She has two children. Her husband is 54 years old. This means in 14 years two children. In her lifetime atleast she will give birth to 20.\"\n\nBOOM received this image on it's WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111) with the caption, \"Increasing Muslim population in the country is a step towards making India a Muslim nation and some of our traitor leaders are also with them in this work. If it is not taken care of in time, then there may be very serious problem. Make population control laws, make the country strong, prosperous and happy\"\n\nSearching on Facebook with the same caption, we found several posts with the same image.\n\nA reverse image search of the photo led us to a BBC News\u2019 video \u2013 \u2018In the jungle with Rohingya refugees feeling Myanmar \u2018 uploaded on YouTube on September 4, 2017.\n\nIn the video, the BBC\u2019s correspondent Sanjoy Majumder is seen walking alongside people fleeing Myanmar. The girl in the image can be seen at 2.06 minutes and the girl is not mentioned in the clip proving that the backstory given to her is fake.\n\nWe also contacted the BBC and they denied that there was any suggestion in the BBC report that the young girl is holding her own child.\n\nIn an email response to BOOM, a BBC spokesperson said, \u2018\u2018The picture circulating on social media is misrepresenting a BBC Report about the first shelter where Rohingaya refugees camp after entering Bangladesh. At no point in the story is there any suggestion the young girl is holding her own child.\"\n\nIn 2017 at the height of the anti-Rohingya rhetoric on social media in India, BOOM had fact-checked this image on September 25, 2017.\n\nAt that time it was shared by a Twitter user named Ravinder Sangwan with a fabricated story that the girl a 14-years-old had two children and was married to a 56-year old man who had six wives and 18 children.\n\nBOOM has previously fact-checked misinformation against Rohingya refugees circulating on social meda.
