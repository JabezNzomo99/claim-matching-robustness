The very first sentence says that election campaign was over by the time the FBI official began investigating Clinton. Trump makes it seem as if both things were happening at once.\n\nOn March 12, 2015, Jill McCabe, a hospital physician, announced her candidacy for the Virginia Senate. McAuliffe was determined to have Democrats win control of the state legislature so he could push through a promised expansion of Medicaid, which Republicans had blocked because it was part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMcCabe was recruited to run against incumbent Richard \u201cDick\u201d Black, a staunch Republican who is often the target of Democrats in his suburban Loudoun County district. (Black nationally is best known for traveling to war-torn Syria in April to demonstrate his support for the administration of President Bashar al-Assad.)\n\nIn July 2015, the FBI launched a criminal investigation of Clinton\u2019s server. The D.C. field office provided resources and personnel to the email probe. In September, Andrew McCabe moved to the FBI\u2019s headquarters, taking the No. 3 position. (Note: an earlier version of this column said he moved in July, based on the WSJ report, but the FBI says the move took place in September; McCabe was formally named to the post in July.)\n\nIn November 2015, Jill McCabe lost her race, with Black getting 52.3 percent to McCabe\u2019s 47.6 percent. Three months later, in February, Andrew McCabe became the FBI\u2019s deputy director and part of an executive team overseeing the Clinton email probe. However, the FBI told the Wall Street Journal, FBI Director James B. Comey made the final decisions on how to proceed.\n\nThe FBI also told the Journal in a statement that Andrew McCabe sought ethics advice from the bureau after McAuliffe and other Democrats met with the couple on March 7, 2015, to urge Jill McCabe to run. He then avoided involvement in public corruption cases in Virginia and did not participate in campaign events, the FBI said.\n\nNowhere in the Journal article does it say that Clinton was aware of the contributions, and Trump offered no evidence to support that claim. He also darkly suggested that these contributions ensured that Clinton was not prosecuted. We sought an explanation from the Trump campaign but did not receive one.\n\nOne might question whether Andrew McCabe should have recused himself from discussions over the email scandal, given the support his wife received from a Clinton confidant. But it\u2019s hard to see how the trail runs to Clinton \u2014 or how McAuliffe would know that the husband of someone he was supporting in a Virginia legislative race was going to be promoted months later.\n\nBy getting the timeline wrong and exaggerating the connections, Trump ends up in Three-Pinocchio range. But then, as he often does, Trump pushes the envelope and makes the unsupported claim that Clinton knew about the payments. It\u2019s almost like he can\u2019t help himself. That tips his statement about the Wall Street Journal article into Four-Pinocchio territory.", "lang": "en"}
