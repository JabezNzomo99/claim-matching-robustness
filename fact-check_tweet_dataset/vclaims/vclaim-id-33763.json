His columns were cited three times in the whistleblower complaint that helped spur House Democrats to open their impeachment investigation into Trump.\n\nThey\u2019ve remained a focal point as the House investigates whether the Trump administration withheld military aid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to publicly commit to an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and the 2016 election.\n\nOn Nov. 19, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., opened the second week of public impeachment hearings by citing Solomon\u2019s scoops and findings as fact.\n\n\"Solomon\u2019s reporting on Burisma, Hunter Biden and Ukraine election meddling has become inconvenient for the Democratic narrative,\" Nunes said in his statement, which came just one day after The Hill announced it would be reviewing, annotating and correcting Solomon\u2019s columns.\n\nSo, who is John Solomon? The veteran Washington, D.C., reporter has become a regular on Fox News and a go-to source of information for Trump. A series of springtime articles he published about Ukraine helped kickstart the events at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHis columns alleged corruption by Biden and a former ambassador and accused Democrats of working with Ukraine to hurt Trump\u2019s chances in 2016. They gained traction as Trump, his allies and various Fox News hosts talked about them on TV and social media.\n\nSolomon did not respond to requests for comment sent to his Facebook page and personal lawyer. Fox News also did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJournalist John Solomon is interviewed at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 14, 2013, in Oxon Hill, Maryland. (AP/Wass)\n\nSolomon worked for years at the Associated Press and briefly at the Washington Post before moving to the Washington Times, where he was editor in chief. He later spent time at Circa and the Center for Public Integrity before joining The Hill in 2017.\n\nSolomon won an award in 2002 for a series on what law enforcement knew ahead of the Sept. 11 attacks. But media critics also questioned his early work, saying he had a \"history of bending the truth to his storyline\" and \"massaging facts to conjure phantom scandals.\"\n\nSolomon\u2019s commentary for The Hill has generated the most buzz. In 2017, he played a major role in pushing the inaccurate Uranium One conspiracy, alleging that Hillary Clinton sold a share of America\u2019s uranium to Russia in exchange for a massive donation to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nIn 2018, The Hill began labeling Solomon\u2019s articles as opinion. Then, in March and April 2019, Solomon published a series of columns alleging conspiracies involving Democrats and Ukraine.\n\nOne of his key sources, apparently, was former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Giuliani, whose activities were central to the administration\u2019s efforts to get an investigation launched into Trump\u2019s political rivals, gave Solomon a cache of information on Biden, his son Hunter and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.\n\n\"I really turned my stuff over to John Solomon,\" Giuliani told the New York Times.\n\nWhen Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top Russia expert, was asked during private testimony how she first learned about Giuliani\u2019s \"interest\" in Ukraine, she mentioned Solomon, whose columns outlined the same conspiracies that Giuliani was actively pushing on Twitter and TV.\n\nSenior State Department official George Kent later testified that what he had described as the \"campaign of slander\" against former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch began with one of Solomon\u2019s articles and ended with Yovanovitch\u2019s removal.\n\nAnd Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, director for European Affairs at the National Security Council, said he became concerned about Giuliani and the narratives he was pushing in part because of Solomon\u2019s columns. State Department official Catherine Croft said the same.\n\nSolomon\u2019s methods have been further scrutinized since the impeachment inquiry began. In March, he shared an advance copy of a column with Giuliani\u2019s associates, including recently indicted Ukrainian businessman Lev Parnas, who has reportedly helped connect him to sources.\n\nSolomon left The Hill in September for undisclosed reasons, and Fox News soon hired him. He has stood by his work as \"completely accurate and transparent,\" even as one impeachment witness after another has questioned his findings.\n\nSolomon\u2019s opinion articles on Ukraine have advanced a number of unsupported allegations about Yovanovitch, the Bidens and supposed Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nHe has had an assist from Fox News host Sean Hannity, Giuliani and Trump, who tweeted about Solomon\u2019s work four times and recently suggested he should win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nSolomon has appeared on Hannity\u2019s primetime TV show at least 55 times since March 20, according to our search via Nexis. He has been mentioned many more times, as well.\n\nOn March 20, Solomon went on Hannity\u2019s show to promote a column he had published that day based on an interview he conducted with Yuriy Lutsenko, then the top prosecutor in Ukraine.\n\nThe column quoted Lutsenko falsely claiming that Yovanovitch gave him a list of people he should not prosecute, a charge the State Department denied and Lutsenko has since retracted. The column also claimed Yovanovitch had privately bad-mouthed Trump, citing a letter from former Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican, to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nYovanovitch denied both allegations during her testimony.\n\nBut the allegations had already left their mark, having been promoted on Hannity and other Fox News programs, circulated within right-wing media and tweeted out by Trump and his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled from her post in May.\n\nOther impeachment witnesses have criticized Solomon\u2019s writing on Yovanovitch. Kent testified that Solomon\u2019s article \"was, if not entirely made up in full cloth, it was primarily non-truths and non-sequiturs.\" He later said he had \"every reason to believe it was not true.\"\n\nVindman said all the \"key elements were false,\" noting that Solomon\u2019s columns \"smelled really rotten\" before joking, \"His grammar might have been right.\"\n\nSimilar objections have been raised in testimony about two articles Solomon published about Biden in April, which were also referenced in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nSolomon\u2019s April columns asserted that then-Vice President Biden forced Ukraine to fire former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin in order to stop an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a gas company for which Hunter Biden served on the board. Solomon wrote that Biden withheld aid dollars from Ukraine as leverage to get Shokin removed.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden, as we\u2019ve noted before. It\u2019s not clear that the long-dormant investigation into Burisma had been reopened, as Solomon claimed, and Western leaders and institutions were united in wanting Shokin removed.\n\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Donald Trump ad misleads about Joe Biden, Ukraine and the prosecutor\n\nIn his closed-door deposition, Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, said he believed Lutsenko \u2014 a key but questionable source in many of Solomon\u2019s columns \u2014 was \"making things up.\" He said Biden \"was representing U.S. policy at the time.\"\n\n\"The allegations themselves, including those against Ambassador Yovanovitch, did not appear to me to be credible at all,\" Volker said during public testimony Nov. 19. \"I\u2019ve known Vice President Biden for a long time. Those accusations were not credible.\"\n\nSolomon\u2019s columns also alleged misconduct in Ukraine by Democratic donor George Soros and claimed, without much evidence, that Democrats coordinated with Ukrainian officials to interfere in the 2016 election by sharing dirt on Trump and reviving a 2014 investigation into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who had ties to the country\u2019s old, pro-Russia regime.\n\nThese claims are unproven, and the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that it was Russia \u2014 not Ukraine \u2014 that interfered in the 2016 election, with the intent of helping Trump.", "lang": "en"}
