Qassem Soleimani an American citizen? No, that does not appear to be true: There is no proof that Zeinab Soleimani became a U.S. citizen because of the Iranian nuclear deal. A meme being shared online cites an entertainment-based wiki page that has since been changed.\n\nThe claim originated from a post (archived here) published by Jillbooks.com on January 14, 2020, under the title \"BAN THIS TERRORIST FROM AMERICA!\" It opened:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nMemes like this circulating online have claimed that President Obama gave U.S. citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of the Iran nuclear deal. As Snopes has already pointed out, this rumor is unproven:\n\nThe meme being shared is filled with grammatical errors and offered no proof to support the rumor that Obama gave hundreds of people, including Zeinab Soleimani, U.S. citizenship. The claim suggested it was part of the Iran nuclear deal negotiations.\n\nIn 2015, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). In 2018, President Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the deal.\n\nAs to the claim that Zeinab is a U.S. citizen, the meme shows a wiki biography from an entertainment site that lists her nationality as American. A screenshot from archive.org on January 5, 2020, listed her as American. However, on January 7, 2020, the site was updated to show she is an Iranian citizen. (Iran does not recognize dual citizenship.)\n\nOn January 7, 2020, Instagram pulled an account that was impersonating the Voice of America Persian, the U.S. government's news agency in Iran, The New York Times reported. At issue: a viral post spreading disinformation:\n\nThe newspaper reported that Iranian media had rejected the reports that Zeinab was a U.S. citizen, but the claims still spread online.\n\nMemes can say anything without offering sourcing or links to back up their claims. They are a useful tool to stir up anger or spread disinformation online, and they are cheap to create. Readers should exercise caution and not assume what they read on a meme is actually true.", "lang": "en"}
