During the meeting, BJP State General Secretary B.Gopalakrishnan openly advocated the ABVP-RSS activists to unleash violence. In the video, he is heard saying \u2013 \u201cWe will enter the campus and beat them up\u201d. Though the meeting was supposedly against violence in the campus, many of those who attended were outsiders, carrying sticks and stones.\n\nThe group soon gathered in front of the college gate, threatening to enter forcibly. The students of the college, many of them SFI activists, blocked their entry at the gates and held them off for a short time. In the video below, one can see objects being pelted from both sides of the gate. Though the ABVP-RSS activists backed down then, they soon came back with more people and entered the campus forcibly, unleashing violence. At 1 minute 28 seconds into the video, one can see ABVP-RSS activists marching into the college.\n\nPitched battles between the students went on for about an hour, during which fifteen students sustained injuries. One student fainted on seeing the bloody fight.", "lang": "en"}
