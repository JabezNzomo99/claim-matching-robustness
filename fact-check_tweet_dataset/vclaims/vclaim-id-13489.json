That means we will have money to spend on priorities like the NHS\u2026 We\u2019ve set out that we\u2019ll be putting more money into the NHS over the next five years, and it will mean \u00a3394 million more a week more going into our National Health Service.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, the Prime Minister has appeared on the radio and written a \u201cletter to the nation\u201d to put forward the benefits, as she sees it, of her Brexit deal. This has included references to an \u201cextra \u00a3394 million per week\u201d for the NHS, which she says the UK will have as a result of no longer having to send \u201cvast amounts to the EU\u201d.\n\nThe government has committed to spending \u00a320.5 billion more on NHS England in 2023/24 compared to 2018/19, which works out as \u00a3394 million per week more by the end of that period. That\u2019s not the same as \u00a3394 million every week between now and 2023/24.\n\nThere is no guaranteed extra money to pay for this increased NHS funding from stopping our payments to the EU budget. Other costs associated with Brexit are expected to outweigh the savings.\n\nWhat is the government spending on the NHS?\n\nEarlier this year the government announced that it would be increasing the amount of money going to the NHS in England by \u00a320.5 billion in real terms by 2023/24. So in that year the budget will be around \u00a320.5 billion higher than in 2018/19, once you account for forecast inflation (the way prices change over that time).\n\nAnother way of saying that is \u00a3394 million more being spent each week by 2023/24, compared to today.\n\nThat\u2019s not the same as \u00a3394 million every week between now and 2023/24. Spending will increase by an average of around \u00a3100 million more a week next year and \u00a3170 million more a week in 2020/21.\n\nThis money doesn\u2019t cover all spending on health across England, it excludes things like public health and training, as well as money for buildings and other infrastructure. The total future health budget won\u2019t be announced until next year so we won\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to those areas until then.\n\nHealth experts have said that \u201cUnless further changes are made, the [Department for Health and Social Care] budget, excluding the NHS England and capital budgets, will fall by \u00a31bn in real terms in 2019/20.\u201d\n\nHealth spending is devolved so the UK government is only responsible for how much is spent on health services in England.\n\nWill the money for the NHS come from Brexit?\n\nMrs May has suggested that post-Brexit this money for the NHS would come, at least in part, from money previously sent to the EU.\n\nThere is no guaranteed extra money\u2014or \u2018Brexit dividend\u2019\u2014as a result of the UK ceasing its contributions to the EU budget after leaving. The UK currently pays around \u00a313 billion to \u00a314 billion into the EU budget every year.\n\nWe get some money back in the form of EU spending on the UK. The government has already indicated that, until at least 2022, it will continue to spend some money on the areas where the EU currently gives us funding. So after factoring that in, when we stop paying into the EU budget in 2021, we\u2019d likely have a \u201cnet\u201d sum of around \u00a39 billion to \u00a310 billion left over each year.\n\nHowever, other costs (for example, parts of the Brexit \u2018divorce\u2019 bill) and economic effects associated with leaving are expected to more than offset that saving.\n\nAny extra funding given to the NHS or any other part of public spending would then need to come from increased taxes, increased borrowing, or reducing spending on something else.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about this here.", "lang": "en"}
