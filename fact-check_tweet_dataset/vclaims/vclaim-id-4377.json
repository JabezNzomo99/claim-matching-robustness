Eisenhower, in 1952.\"\n\nHe went on:\n\n\"And I won Wisconsin. And I like Wisconsin a lot, but we won Wisconsin. And Ronald Reagan, remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win.\"\n\nA look at the numbers\n\nAccording to the American Presidency Project, the following Republicans have won Wisconsin\u2019s presidential vote since 1952:\n\nThe Republican presidential dry spell stretched from the 1988 election, when Democrat Michael Dukakis won Wisconsin, through 2012 when Democrat Barack Obama won Wisconsin.\n\nBut it did not stretch back to Eisenhower.\n\nAnd, for the record, the one state Reagan lost in 1984 was neighboring Minnesota, not Wisconsin.\n\nTrump said Wisconsin \"hadn\u2019t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952.\" and that \"Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win.\"\n\nElection records show that Trump is wrong on both counts.\n\nThe president might want to find another applause line for Wisconsin, because Republican candidates not named Trump won the state six times since Eisenhower\u2019s 1952 win.\n\nWe rate his claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
