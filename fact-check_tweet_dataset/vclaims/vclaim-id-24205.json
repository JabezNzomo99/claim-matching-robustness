The WHO \u201cCouncil on Eugenics\u201d does not exist.\n\nIn light of the recent measles outbreak that has been tied to unvaccinated populations, this meme attempts to use the specter of Kissinger to imply that vaccination, especially mandatory vaccination, is a government conspiracy that allows the powerful to \u201ccontrol the herd.\u201d\n\nThe full text of the image reads, \u201cOnce the herd accepts mandatory forcible vaccination, it\u2019s game over! They will accept anything \u2013 forcible blood or organ donation \u2014 for the \u2018greater good.\u2019 We can genetically modify children and sterilize them \u2013 for the \u2018greater good.\u2019 Control sheep minds and you control the herd. Vaccine makers stand to make billions, and many of you in this room today are investors. It\u2019s a big win-win! We thin out the herd and the herd pays us for providing extermination services. Now, what\u2019s for lunch, huh?\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller found no evidence, however, of Kissinger or any other political figure making such a statement, in 2009 or at any other time. Kissinger\u2019s speeches are well documented, and there is no record of this quote in an interview or book.\n\nThe statement would be outrageous for someone with as much influence and prestige as Kissinger to say without it being documented by a major news outlet.\n\nFurthermore, WHO\u2019s so-called \u201cCouncil on Eugenics\u201d does not exist. As such, Kissinger did not give a speech to them on the date in question.\n\nKissinger\u2019s website, which features some of his prominent speeches, does not include any remarks given in February 2009. Other sources show that he spoke to the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 6 of that year, and vaccinations were not discussed.\n\nSome critics of Kissinger, and vaccines in general, have attempted to use his involvement in a 1974 study on the consequences of rapid population growth globally as proof that he supported eugenics or nefarious population control mechanisms.\n\nIn April, New York City\u2019s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, ordered that any residents living or working in the Brooklyn area, where there has been an outbreak, must be immediately vaccinated against the disease unless they can prove immunity or provide evidence of a medical exemption.", "lang": "en"}
