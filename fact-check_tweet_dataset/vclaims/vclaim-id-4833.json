It has featured on a number of pro-independence websites since 2010, including Bella Caledonia, Oil of Scotland and Referendum Answers.\n\nThe first online appearance of a similar claim seems to be in a letter to The Herald on 15 March 2009, saying: \u201cHow many people in Scotland know that over the past 30 years Scotland has produced more oil than Dubai and Abu Dhabi combined?\u201d\n\nThis claim, while similar, refers to the 30 years before 2009, rather than the current production rate.\n\nIt is true that Scotland, as part of the UK, accounts for more than 60 per cent of EU oil production \u2013 as well as 60 per cent of its reserves \u2013 and approximately a third of the EU\u2019s total hydrocarbon production.\n\nNorway produces more oil but is not an EU member, although it is part of the European Economic Area (EEA). The second biggest EU oil producer is Denmark.\n\nNorway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund was established in 1990 to invest the oil surplus in order to counter fluctuation in the price of oil. Its value reached $1.1 trillion in 2017 and is the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund.\n\nFormer First Minister Alex Salmond has argued that an independent Scotland should set-up a similar fund.\n\nA 2018 report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think-tank estimated that had Westminster created a similar fund from the North Sea oil revenues in the 1980s, it would be worth over \u00a3500bn today.\n\nThe Scottish Government\u2019s oil and gas production statistics include the amount of oil produced in Scotland, including adjacent waters, in million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe).\n\nLooking at the production of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL), 2016 statistics show that 49.5 mtoe was produced in 2016 \u2013 the latest available figure. The first figure to be recorded was 132.4 mtoe in 1998, and peak production in the 18-year scope was 136.9 mtoe in 1999.\n\nOil production then began broadly to decline year-on-year, though the last two years have seen increases.\n\nData for Abu Dhabi and Dubai is harder to come by, as the two states form part of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which releases oil production statistics overall but not split by emirate.\n\nSo it is not possible to exactly compare Scotland to Abu Dhabi and Dubai combined.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) library gives oil production figures for the UAE.\n\nThis shows that in 2003, UAE oil production began to outstrip Scotland\u2019s and has broadly increased while production in Scotland has declined. The latest 2016 figures show 156.4 mtoe was produced.\n\nAccording to the UAE U.S. Embassy, the UAE\u2019s \u201cproven oil reserves were 97.8 billion barrels as of 2015. Abu Dhabi holds 92.2 billion barrels, followed by Dubai with 4 billion barrels, Sharjah with 1.5 billion barrels and Ras al Khaimah with 500 million barrels\u201d.\n\nIt is clear that Abu Dhabi has by far the most oil reserves, and 23 times more than Dubai. We can safely assume that as Abu Dhabi holds the lion\u2019s share of the UAE\u2019s oil reserves, it is also likely to be the UAE\u2019s primary oil producer.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that a country\u2019s oil reserves does not necessarily reflect its rate of oil production.\n\nAccording to market expert, The Oil and Gas Year, Abu Dhabi currently exports 885 million barrels with a production of around 153 mtoe. This alone far outstrips Scotland.\n\nScotland is the largest producer of oil in the European Union, while Denmark is the second highest as Norway is not a member. Comparing Abu Dhabi and Dubai\u2019s oil with Scotland is difficult as official statistics show only the overall production of the United Arab Emirates, and not individual states. However, OECD data shows that the production in the UAE has far exceeded Scotland\u2019s over the past decade, and reliable estimates show that Abu Dhabi is the major UAE producer, and produces far more oil.", "lang": "en"}
