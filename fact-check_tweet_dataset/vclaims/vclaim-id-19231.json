Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of the current situation (protests and clashes) in Kashmir. Fact: The video shown as the current situation (protests and clashes) in Kashmir in the post is made by joining two old videos. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, no results matching the video were found in the search results. So, when searched for the video manually on YouTube with the keywords \u2018Army Kashmir clash\u2019, two videos which were used in making the posted video were found in the search results.\n\nVideo 1:\n\nThis video has the title: \u2018Live Video of Indian Army Encounter with Militants in Jammu and Kashmir after Burhan Wani death\u2019 and was uploaded on July 25, 2016. So, it is an old video.\n\nVideo 2:\n\nThis video was found to be uploaded on February 26, 2019. So, this video was also not taken in this month after the Indian government\u2019s decision on Article 370.\n\nThe exact time, location and the context of the videos were not found but from the available information it can be concluded that these are not the recent videos taken in J&K after the abrogation of Article 370.\n\nTo sum it up, old videos are being shared as video showing the current situation in J&K.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
