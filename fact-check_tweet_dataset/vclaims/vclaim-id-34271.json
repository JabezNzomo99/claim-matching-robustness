Police came down heavily on the protesting students who were marching towards the Parliament with their plea. Multiple students were also injured in the face-off.\n\nThe caption in Hindi translates to: \"When it comes to faith, flowers are showered. If we talk about education, we get battered. This is the reality of Yogi and Modi. They mean that no one from a poor family gets educated.\"\n\nThe post can be seen below and its archived version is available here.\n\nThe photograph was also shared by one Milind Fulzele on Facebook with a fake claim. He wrote, \"Its a shame that Modi government has been mercilessly beating JNU students\" (JNU \u091b\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094b \u0915\u094b \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092c\u0930\u092c\u0930\u0924\u093e\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0915 \u092a\u093f\u091f\u0928\u093e \u091b\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u0948)\n\nThe photo with the same claim is also viral on Twitter.\n\nBOOM had debunked the same photo when it had gone viral as that from Kashmir. A reverse image search showed that it was first published by one Jafariya News.com, a Shia news website on February 20, 2005.\n\nThe image goes back to February 2005, where it was included in an article on the observation of Ashura (tenth day of Muharram) around the world. The viral image was included under Lebanon suggesting that the image was from there.", "lang": "en"}
