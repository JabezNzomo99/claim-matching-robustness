Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the same video was found to be uploaded on YouTube with the title \u2013 \u2018New Anarkali Faisalabad 18 May k taaza manazir\u2019. Faisalabad is a city in Pakistan. Also, the same video was found to be posted by multiple Pakistan users in the context of New Anarkali Bazaar (Faisalabad, Pakistan) on 18 May 2020; before it was picked and shared in the context of Hyderabad (India). The video was also tweeted by a verified Twitter user from Pakistan with the description \u2013 \u2018Scene from a market in Faisalabad\u2019.\n\nIn the video, at 10 seconds, a placard with Urdu text (translation \u2013 \u2018Aini Shoes\u2019) can be seen. On Google Maps, it can be found that there is a shop with the name \u2018Aini Shoes\u2019 at New Anarkali Bazaar in Faisalabad (Pakistan).\n\nAlso, it should be noted that the Telangana government has allowed any two adjacent shops to open on alternate days in the GHMC (Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation) area only from 19 May 2020. But the video was first found on the internet on 18 May 2020. The visuals of alternate shops opened in the Charminar area can be watched here.\n\nTo sum it up, a video from Pakistan falsely shared as \u2018Crowd with no social distancing at a shopping center in Old city (Hyderabad)\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
