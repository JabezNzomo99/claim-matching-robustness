During the show, Dominguez supposedly announced a new \u201cwealth loophole\u201d that can transform anyone into a millionaire within 3 to 4 months.\n\n\u201cWhat made me successful is jumping into new opportunities quickly \u2013 without any hesitation. And right now, my number one money-maker is a new cryptocurrency auto-trading program called Bitcoin Revolution. It's the single biggest opportunity I've seen in my entire lifetime to build a small fortune fast. I urge everyone to check this out before the banks shut it down,\" the website quoted Dominguez as saying.\n\nThe website also included screenshots of what looked like Dominguez\u2019s money transfers using the platform. It also claimed that this information appeared on other legitimate newspapers and used the logos of the Philippine Star, Manila Times, Daily Tribune, and Manila Bulletin.\n\nThe Department of Finance (DOF) has repeatedly warned the public about investment scams using names of Finance and Treasury officials. The videos uploaded on the official YouTube channel of Eat Bulaga! also do not show Dominugez ever guesting in the noontime show this year.\n\nIn a press release in May, the DOF refuted the claim that the government has created a platform for bitcoin trading. \u201cThere is no such effort by the government,\u201d Finance Assistant Secretary Antonio Joselito Lambino II said.\n\n\u201cWe warn those behind these unscrupulous and unauthorized investment schemes that the government is monitoring the public space for such schemes, and will take appropriate legal and regulatory action,\u201d the DOF said in a statement.\n\nOn July 28, Dominguez also sought help from the justice department through a letter addressed to Justice Secretary Menardo I. Guevarra. Dominguez asked for assistance in stopping investment ploys that use his name and other officials \u201cin an attempt to dupe the public into falling for the scam.\u201d\n\nThere is also no report about Dominguez's supposed endorsement of the bitcoin platform from the newspapers mentioned in the article. Instead, the Philippine Star, Manila Bulletin, and Manila Times all published articles citing the DOF\u2019s warning against bitcoin investment scams. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
