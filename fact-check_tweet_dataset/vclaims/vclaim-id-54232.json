Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of the baby born with three eyes. Fact: The posted video is an edited one. Using the editing software, the left eye of the baby is copied and placed as an extra eye on the forehead. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched about the baby in the video, no information was found about the baby being born with three eyes. If any such three-eyed baby really exists, more videos and images of the baby would have been found on the internet, but no other video or photo was found. Also, on observing the video, it can be seen that the left eye and the eye on the forehead are identical in every frame.\n\nUsing the editing software, the left eye of the baby is copied and placed as an extra eye on the forehead. FACTLY has also edited the posted video, using the \u2018After Effects\u2019 software, to show the same baby having two eyes in one video and four eyes in the other. Those visuals can be seen below.\n\nNot just three or four eyes, with the help of editing software, any number of eyes can be placed. The process followed in the \u2018After Effects\u2019 software can be seen below.\n\nAlso, it was found that one of the earliest uploads of the video was on Twitter by a Chinese user on 9 July 2020. It was found that the same user has also posted another edited video of a dinosaur on his account.\n\nTo sum it up, an edited video falsely shared as a video of \u2018Baby born in with three eyes\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
