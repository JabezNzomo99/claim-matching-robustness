The probe was led at first by Kenneth Starr and then passed on to Robert W. Ray. The $59.9 million total was the highest ever, in raw dollars, after the $47.4 million spent by Lawrence E. Walsh in the 1980s Iran-contra inquiry. (Adjusting for inflation, the Iran-contra probe was probably more costly.)\n\n\u201cDuring any 6-month reporting period, there may be other significant costs incurred in support of the work of the counsels. These costs are paid from appropriations other than the permanent, indefinite appropriation established to fund independent counsel activities. These costs arise when a counsel uses detailees from other federal agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Independent counsels are not required to reflect such costs in their statements of expenditures and neither the independent counsels nor special counsel does so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs guidance, yes, it reflects what components would have incurred for the investigations irrespective of the existence of the SCO,\u201d said Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s unknowable what the exact amount would have been if a Special Counsel had not been selected, and that amount does not include the salaries of any DOJ employees \u2014 prosecutors, paralegals, support staff, etc. \u2014 which are now being paid through the permanent, indefinite appropriation but would also have incurred in some way.\u201d\n\nResponding to our questions about these caveats in Mueller\u2019s expense statements, a White House official pointed to the AP\u2019s reporting of $17 million in costs. \u201cThey were technically paid for their work on the investigation,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was reflected in the report. Some were reassigned from different departments and taken away from other important duties to work on this investigation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that many of these salary and benefit costs would be paid anyway, since much of Mueller\u2019s team consists of employees who already worked for the federal government and were detailed to the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Last, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Mueller is adding $9 million in a category of indirect costs that no other special counsel reported previously.", "lang": "en"}
