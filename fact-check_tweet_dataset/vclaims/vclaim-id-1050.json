Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Reuters could not find evidence that these any of these quotes are accurate.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nThe image reads: \u201c\u2019You need to vote for the Democrats, otherwise the illegal aliens will lose their rights.\u2019 \u2013 Nancy Pelosi (2019), \u2018No ordinary American cares about Constitutional rights.\u2019 \u2013 Joe Biden, And my personal favorite: \u2018Owning guns is not a right. If it were a right, it would be in the Constitution.\u2019 \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (2018)\u201d\n\nThe image doesn\u2019t say where or when any of the alleged comments were made.\n\nReuters could not find any records of Speaker Pelosi saying \u201c\u2019You need to vote for the Democrats, otherwise the illegal aliens will lose their rights.\u201d\n\nA Google search brings up pages using this quote with no attribution to a source.\n\nIn a press conference in June 2018, Pelosi told a reporter that using terminology like \u201cillegal alien\u201d is not constructive. The video is available on C-SPAN. Her exact words can be heard around the 15:30 mark ( here ). It is therefore unlikely that Pelosi would have used the terminology in the alleged quote.\n\nReuters found no evidence former Vice President Biden ever said the words \u201cNo ordinary American cares about Constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nSome forums and posts featuring the article link to a Breitbart article that reads, \u201cBiden: No Ordinary American Cares About Their Constitutional Rights, Facebook Questions are Plants\u201d ( here ). The article mentions a February 21, 2013 forum at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury where then Vice President Biden spoke about gun control.\n\nA video on the New York Times website shows Biden\u2019s speech at the university. ( here ) The closest to the quote in the claim can be seen round the 11:10 mark: \u201cNo law-abiding citizen in the United States of America has any fear that their constitutional rights will be infringed in any way. None, zero.\u201d\n\nThe actual quote is significantly different to the quote in this claim. Biden did not say \u201cNo ordinary American cares about their constitutional rights\u201d.\n\n\u201cOwning guns is not a right. If it were a right, it would be in the constitution.\u201d\n\nReuters could not find any record of Ocasio-Cortez saying this. The social media posts do not provide any context or other information about the purported quote.\n\nOcasio-Cortez clarified her stance on the second amendment on the right to keep and bear arms while answering questions on a Reddit thread when she was running as a candidate for Congress in 2017:\n\n\u201cCombating domestic terrorism? Keep the severely mentally ill and people with a history of domestic abuse from purchasing guns. I am a believer in the second amendment, but this is where I draw the line.\u201d ( here )\n\nOn her website, she calls for \u201ccommon sense gun reform with the goal of eliminating gun violence and saving lives\u201d ( here ).\n\nIt is unlikely that, as a Congresswoman, Ocasio-Cortez would not be aware of the existence and meaning of the second amendment.\n\nReuters previously debunked the Biden and Ocasio-Cortez quotes, along with other false quotes attributed to prominent Democrats, in a fact check visible here .\n\nFalse claim. All three quotes were altered or fabricated.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .", "lang": "en"}
