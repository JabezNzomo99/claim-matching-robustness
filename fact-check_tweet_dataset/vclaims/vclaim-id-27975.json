The show's writers didn't so much \"predict\" such campaigns, as satirize previous ones, which happened to be replicated in the years since the episode aired.\n\nThe episode in question did show a campaign to censor and cover up the male figure's genitals in Michelangelo's \"David,\" and the show did air in 1990, years before several real-life campaigns to similarly censor replicas of the statue.\n\nSeveral times in recent years, various websites and online \u201clisticles\u201d have claimed that, among other uncanny predictions, the Simpsons once pre-empted the real-life censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d statue.\n\nIn particular, in 2017 the comedian and former NFL punter Pat McAfee devoted a five-minute segment on his podcast to reviewing and promoting various claimed instances where the classic animated sitcom was remarkably prescient about events that were yet to happen.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s David: 1990 [it occurred on the show], 2016 it happened.\u201d\n\nLikewise, in a 2018 article listing more than 30 occasions when \u201creal life has imitated \u2018The Simpsons,'\u201d the Daily Telegraph wrote:\n\nItchy and Scratchy also featured heavily in the 1990 episode Itchy and Scratchy and Marge, in which Marge led a censorship campaign, horrified by the show\u2019s violence. She later realised the censorship had gone too far, after Michelangelo\u2019s David was taken to a Springfield museum, and local citizens protested against the statue\u2019s nudity. In 2001, a Florida-based shop put a replica of Michelangelo\u2019s David outside its front door. A handful of citizens objected to the \u201cindecent\u201d statue and successfully campaigned to have David\u2019s private parts covered with a cloth. More recently, in 2014, an elderly British couple, Clive and Joan Burgess, received complaints from neighbours and faced an intervention from their local council, after they placed a replica of the statue in their front garden.\n\nIn May 2019, Business Insider published a list of \u201c18 Times \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 Accurately Predicted the Future,\u201d including the bowdlerization of \u201cDavid\u201d:\n\n\u201cAn episode from 1990 titled \u2018Itchy and Scratchy and Marge\u2019 showed Springfieldians protesting against Michelangelo\u2019s statue of David being exhibited in the local museum, calling the artwork obscene for its nudity. The satire of censorship came true in July 2016, when Russian campaigners voted on whether to clothe a copy of the Renaissance statue that had been set up in central St. Petersburg.\u201d\n\nThe basic facts, dates, and descriptions of events laid out in these articles and in McAfee\u2019s podcast were accurate. The episode in question was Season 2, Episode 9, \u201cItchy and Scratchy and Marge,\u201d and it did indeed first air on Dec. 20, 1990.\n\nIn the episode, Marge rails against the ultra-violence and obscenity of the \u201cItchy and Scratchy Show,\u201d and leads a campaign of censorship against the cartoon. The writers brilliantly examine and expose the relativity and subjectivity of taste, obscenity, and moral standards in culture, and Marge\u2019s crusade spirals out of control, culminating in a local group picketing Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d for its nudity.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that, as McAfee alluded to, a campaign took place in the Russian city of St. Petersburg in 2016 that aimed to remove a replica of the statue, or cover up the male figure\u2019s genitals \u2014 not a far cry from the kind of campaign depicted in the 1990 \u201cSimpsons\u201d episode.\n\nHowever, the difficulty in claiming that Matt Groening and his writers \u201cpredicted\u201d the censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d lies in the fact that campaigns to cover up nude works of art in general, and \u201cDavid\u201d in particular, have existed for centuries. The prevalence of fig leafs on classical statues is testament to that, as Alexxa Gotthardt wrote for the website Artsy in 2018:\n\nTake Michelangelo\u2019s famous sculpture \u201cDavid\u201d (1501\u201304), a muscular, starkly naked depiction of its namesake biblical hero. The work scandalized the artist\u2019s fellow Florentines and the Catholic clergy when unveiled in Florence\u2019s Piazza della Signoria in 1504. Soon after, the figure\u2019s sculpted phallus was girdled with a garland of bronze fig leaves by authorities. 60 years later, just months before Michelangelo\u2019s death, the Catholic Church issued an edict demanding that \u201cfigures shall not be painted or adorned with a beauty exciting \u2026 lust.\u201d The clergy began a crusade to camouflage the pensises and pubic hair visible in artworks across Italy. Their coverups of choice? Loincloths, foliage, and \u2014 most often \u2014 fig leaves. It has became known as the \u201cFig Leaf Campaign,\u201d one of history\u2019s most significant acts of art censorship.\n\nA more recent example, described by the website of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, came in the mid-1800s, when the Grand Duke of Tuscany presented Queen Victoria with a 6-meter-high cast of the original statue:\n\n\u201cThe story goes that on her first encounter with the cast of \u2018David\u2019 at the Museum, Queen Victoria was so shocked by the nudity that a proportionally accurate fig leaf was commissioned. It was then kept in readiness for any royal visits, when it was hung on the figure using two strategically placed hooks.\u201d\n\nRather than \u201cpredicting\u201d the censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid,\u201d the writers of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d were merely describing and satirizing moral crusades of that kind, which had already been happening for hundreds of years, and happened to continue to take place in the nearly 30 years since the episode first aired.", "lang": "en"}
