{"title": "Child poverty: Boris Johnson's claims fact-checked", "subtitle": "The prime minister has made four claims on poverty, do the figures support them?", "author": "www.bbc.co.uk", "date": "2020-06-29T00:09:46.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-53013", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/53181798", "vclaim": "It was \u00a3514 a week in 2018-19, or \u00a3447 after housing costs. You then take 60% of this amount and anyone whose income is less than this is considered to be living in relative poverty.\n\nThis \"poverty line\" moves when the median income changes. During the recession, for example, when lots of people's wages went down, relative poverty rates improved but it is unlikely that those at the bottom felt wealthier.\n\nBut it also doesn't reflect how, if standards are increasing year-on-year for better off people in society, the poorest are being left behind. This is because it is comparing salaries to the median income from a decade ago.\n\nClaim 1. Boris Johnson: \"Absolute poverty and relative poverty have both declined under this government.\"\n\nHe became leader in July 2019 but since the poverty figures for last year have not been published there is no way of judging what has happened to them under \"this government\".\n\nClaim 2. Boris Johnson: \"There are 100,000 fewer children in absolute poverty.\"\n\nClaim 3. Boris Johnson: \"There are...500,000 fewer children falling below low-income and material deprivation.\"\n\nIt asks what items or services parents can't afford either for themselves or for their children. This includes the ability to go on a school trip once a term, to eat fresh fruit and vegetables every day or to keep the house warm.\n\nClaim 4. Boris Johnson: \"There are hundreds of thousands - I think 400,000 - fewer families living in poverty now than there were in 2010.\"", "lang": "en"}
