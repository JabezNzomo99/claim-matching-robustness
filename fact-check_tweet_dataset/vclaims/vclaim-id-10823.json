Our efforts to reach the writer were unsuccessful.\n\n\"Why would Brazile have to fear for her life after the Rich murder \u2014 if, as we\u2019ve been told, it was simply a robbery gone bad?\" states the article. \"Does she suspect someone of the murder? Does she suspect the Clintons?\"\n\nWe found nothing in Brazile\u2019s recent book that pins the Rich murder on the Clintons.\n\nNear dawn on July 10, 2016, 27-year-old Rich was found with two fatal gunshot wounds near his home in Washington, D.C. Rich was had been working on voter access projects for the DNC.\n\nWeeks later, Rich\u2019s death became intertwined with WikiLeaks after it released hacked emails from the DNC. WikiLeaks head Julian Assange suggested in a Dutch television interview that Rich might have been murdered.\n\nIn \"Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House,\" Brazile wrote about the grief and fears she felt in the aftermath of Rich\u2019s murder, even closing the blinds in her office so a sniper couldn\u2019t see her.\n\nBrazile wrote that she felt some responsibility for Rich\u2019s death.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights,\" she wrote.\n\nShe speculated about the motivation behind his shooting but wrote that police believed he was a victim of a robbery.\n\n\"With all I knew now about the Russians\u2019 hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in his unsolved murder,\" she wrote, though stating that the FBI told her they didn\u2019t see Russian fingerprints on the case. \"Besides that, racial tensions were high that summer and I worried that he was murdered for being white on the wrong side of town.\"\n\nShe also wondered \"had he been killed by someone who had it out for the Democrats? Likely not, but we still didn\u2019t know.\"\n\n\"Some Trump supporters were promoting the baseless conspiracy theory that Seth had been murdered by the DNC because he was the one who had leaked our emails to WikiLeaks.\"\n\nWe attempted to contact Brazile through her website but did not get a reply.\n\nThe headline on the US Political website states \"Donna Brazile knows Seth Rich was murdered by the Clintons.\" The article refers to Brazile\u2019s book in which she speculates on the motivations behind the DNC staffer\u2019s murder, but she doesn\u2019t point the finger at the Clintons.\n\nWe rate this headline Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
