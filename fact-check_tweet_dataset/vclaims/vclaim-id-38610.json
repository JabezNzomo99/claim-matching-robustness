The claim is false; India\u2019s national geological agency clarified that just 160 kilograms of gold was discovered at the site; the images in the posts do not relate to the gold discovery.\n\nThe claim was published in a Facebook here on February 27, 2020. It has since been shared more than 500 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Hindi-language text superimposed on the graphic translates to English as: \u201cThe people who called Lord Rama as imaginary must see this. Here they held a meeting on construction of Rama temple and there discovered 3500 tonnes of gold in Sonbhadra. Hail Shri Rama.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption states: \u201cThis is also a coincidence that the Supreme Court of India delivered a verdict on the disputed birthplace of Lord Rama on November 8 and a stack of gold of about 3500 tonnes was discovered only a day after the first meeting of members of the Ram Temple Construction Trust exactly after four months of the court's decision. This Is a divine deed of lord Rama. Hail Sri Rama.\u201d\n\nSonbhadra is the district in Uttar Pradesh where the post claims the gold was discovered.\n\nThe post also makes reference to Lord Rama by using his photo at the top in the misleading post. Ram is one of the most prominent Hindu deities and a recent Supreme Court verdict that ruled in favour of Hindu control over a disputed holy site in Ayodhya, another town in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nA similar claim was also shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; the Geological Survey of India (GSI) \u2013 the government\u2019s national mining body \u2013 said the amount of gold discovered at the site was considerably less than 3,500 tonnes.\n\n\u201cGSI has not estimated such kind of vast resource of gold deposits in Sonbhadra district,\u201d Ashish Kumar Nath, the GSI Director and Public Relation Officer, said in a statement that was published on Twitter here on February 22, 2020.\n\nThe agency added that out of the estimated 52,806.25 tonnes of ore in area, roughly 160 kilograms of gold could be extracted.\n\nThe image on the left-hand side of the misleading posts was published here in an article published by Indian news site The Quint in February 2020.\n\nThe article does not relate to the gold discovery Sonbhadra district. It reports on Indian prime minister Narendra Modi's meeting with trustees of Ram Temple board after the Supreme Court verdict over a disputed holy site in Ayodhya.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image in the article:\n\nThe image on the right-hand side of the misleading posts is a stock photo of gold that has been published in various unrelated articles here, here and here since at least 2017.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo in one of the articles:", "lang": "en"}
