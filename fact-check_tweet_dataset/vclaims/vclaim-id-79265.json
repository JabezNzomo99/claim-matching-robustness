It lists under \u201cGrounds for International Complaint alleged charges of \u201cwar crimes with intent to commit mass genocide\u201d. The hearing is listed for \u201c1:00 P.M. (UTC-6) on the 79th Day in the Year of Yahweh 6022. (Friday, June 5, 2020)\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption also claims, \u201cHere is something never seen before until now!\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s purported document falsely claims that Bill Gates, Dr Anthony Fauci, the World Health Organization and CDC, among others, have faced a human rights tribunal for war crimes. There is no evidence \u201cThe Human Rights Tribunal International\u201d exists.\n\nThe document features the letterhead, \u201cThe Human Rights Tribunal International\u201d, however there is no such tribunal in the US. A list of United Nations bodies involved in human rights promotion and protection also shows no listing for the purported tribunal.\n\nWar crimes are heard in the International Criminal Court, however, the United States is not a member of the court.\n\nThe hearing date on the document is for the \u201c79th Day in the Year of Yahweh 6022\u201d and, in brackets, Friday, June 5, 2020. An online search showed no reports of a hearing on that date against the people and organisations named in the post.\n\nAt the bottom of the document are links to two websites, the first link redirects to Reign of the Heavens. The website is listed as \u201cnot secure\u201d and under a page titled, \u201cHistory of the Human Rights Tribunal\u201d, it states \u201cthe present Human Rights Tribunal started within the Reign of the Heavens before it was placed in trust\u201d.\n\nAt the bottom of the webpage it links to a separate document with the letterhead, \u201cThe Government of The United States of America\u201d and \u201cGeneral Post Master Council\u201d. The document is dated May 2, 2014 and states the General Post Master Council and the courts of the Government of The United States of America \u201cacknowledge the obligations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\u201c. A search of pages on US government websites showed no results for \u201cGeneral Post Master Council\u201d.\n\nSimilar versions of the post have been debunked here, here and here.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Instagram post to be false. The people and organisations named in the post have not been brought before \u201cThe Human Rights Tribunal International\u201d to face war crimes. There is no evidence that the tribunal exists. False \u2013 The primary claims within the post are inaccurate. AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network.
