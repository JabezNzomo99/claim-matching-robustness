'Ganga during Modi\u2019s rule', is written on the photograph in Bangla.\n\nThe first image (see below) represents a polluted Ganges, strewn with waste floating on the water and 'Ganga during the Congress rule' is written on it in Bangla.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the post had been shared more than 5000 times.\n\nThe posts can be viewed here and here. And the archived versions here and here.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on both the images used in the collage and found that both had been shot before the BJP government came to power in May 2014.\n\nBOOM cropped the image which portrays a cleaner Ganga into two parts and ran two separate searches.\n\nWhile doing a reverse image search on the clean Ganga image, the time period was reset to \u2018before 2014\u2019 when Narendra Modi came to power.\n\nWe were directed to a website of Jodi Surfas, a Colorado-based travel writer, who had documented her Rishikesh visit on March, 2012. A larger and original size of the same photograph is there in Surfas\u2019 travel writing about Rishikesh.\n\nBOOM found that the image had later been used as representative for several news articles.\n\nMeanwhile, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\u2019s poorly photoshopped image that had been placed on the picture, is originally from 2019, when the Congress leader visited Sangam on March 18, this year.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found that the image is originally from 2009. It has been uploaded in international stock photo website, Getty, by photographer Prakash Singh.", "lang": "en"}
