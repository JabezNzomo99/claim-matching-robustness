In 1849 she escaped.

I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves.\u201d\n\nin Maxwell Perspective, a magazine by the Maxwell School at\n\nin the US, argues that the quote is not by Tubman.\n\n\u201d during the 2008 US Democratic Party\u2019s primary presidential candidate race between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nMorgan supported Clinton, and in the essay challenged other women who did not.\n\n: \u201cLet a statement by the magnificent Harriet Tubman stand as reply. When asked how she managed to save hundreds of enslaved African Americans via the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, she replied bitterly, \u2018I could have saved thousands \u2013 if only I\u2019d been able to convince them they were slaves.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe implication was that women who didn\u2019t support Clinton were similarly enslaved, and didn\u2019t know it.\n\nQuote from a work of fiction\n\nBut experts on Tubman quickly questioned the quote. None of them could find it in primary sources written during her life. (Tubman herself was illiterate.)\n\n, professor emeritus of history and African American studies at Maxwell School\n\n\u201cMy impression is that this is a late 20th century quote from a fictionalised account of Tubman\u2019s life,\u201d Sernett told history blogger\n\n, who first queried the quote.\n\nThe US-based fact-checking site Snopes has checked the quote and rated the claim that it is by Tubman as\n\n: \u201cThere is no original quote for this. This quote was entirely made up, and became popularised starting sometime in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cThere is no documentation, nor historical basis for this quote.\u201d\n\nMore than this, at meetings in 1858 and 1859 Tubman repeatedly said she had personally\n\nfrom slavery. So she would never have said she \u201cfreed a thousand slaves\u201d.\n\nHistorians reckon she directly freed about 70 slaves, although more freed themselves with the help of instructions she left behind.\n\nIs it possible that Tubman could have said something similar?\n\n. She had been a slave, and knew the horrors of slavery. People who are slaves are fully aware of their condition and its injustices.\n\n\u201cEnslaved people resisted their condition in countless ways, large and small,\u201d\n\nof Rice University in the US.\n\n\u201cIf they were not able to attain freedom, it was not because they didn\u2019t want it or because (as the fake Tubman quote would have it) they \u2018did not know they were slaves\u2019. It was because powerful forces were arrayed against them.\u201d\n\nVictims of human trafficking know they are not free\n\nMcDaniel says he worries that the fake Tubman quote \u201ccould have the same \u2018red herring\u2019 effect in conversations about modern trafficking\u201d.\n\nIt encourages people who quote and read it to \u201cbelieve that the only thing standing between modern slaves and freedom is knowledge, self-awareness, education, and a willingness to actively dissent\u201d.\n\nBut this, McDaniels says, \u201ccomes uncomfortably close to the paternalistic idea that those who somehow \u2018choose\u2019 not to be freed or don\u2019t \u2018know\u2019 they are slaves must tacitly consent to their own exploitation\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
