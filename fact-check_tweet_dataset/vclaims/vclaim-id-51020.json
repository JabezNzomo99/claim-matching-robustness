The Taal Volcano has been raised to Alert Level 5, because of the continuous eruption of ash, mud and small rocks that was observed at 1 this afternoon. Anytime now the volcano could explode hot ember and mud which is called lava (magma). / Also right now, the areas of Lobo, Balayan, Mabini and Tagaytay are experiencing the Receding of water which bodes of a big wave of water called TSUNAMI!\u201d\n\nNDRRMC refers to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, the Philippine disaster agency.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS-DOST), an Alert Level 5 for a volcano indicates a \u201cHazardous Eruption in Progress,\u201d which denotes \u201cextreme hazards to communities west of the volcano and ashfalls on downwind sectors.\u201d\n\nOther posts that did not include the tsunami photo made similar claims about the Taal volcano, which is located on an island in the middle of a lake south of Manila. Examples can be seen here and here on Facebook, and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim is false; NDRRMC documents show the Taal volcano remains on Alert Level 4, and the image in the misleading Facebook post is an artistic depiction of a tsunami, unrelated to the Philippines or the Taal volcano.\n\n\u201cAs of 12 January 2020, 7:30 PM, the alert level of Taal Volcano was raised from Alert Level 3 (magmatic unrest) to Alert Level 4 (hazardous eruption imminent),\" the NDRRMC stated in a report released on January 13, 2020. \"This means that hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days.\u201d\n\nThis NDRRMC update, published at 8:00 am local time on January 15, 2020, states Taal volcano remains at Alert Level 4.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nPHIVOLCS-DOST also issued this statement on its Facebook page on January 13, 2020 refuting claims of Alert Level 5 being raised.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe Tagalog-language statement partly translates to English as: \"READ: An ALERT LEVEL 4 is still raised in TAAL VOLCANO which could be seen in the volcano bulletin released by our agency this 8 AM, 13 January 2020. NO TRUTH to news circulating on various social media accounts about the raising of Taal Volcano to Alert Level 5.\n\n\u201cMAYON VOLCANO is on ALERT LEVEL 2 since March 29, 2018. NOT TRUE that its Alert Level was only raised now. \u201d\n\nThe statement\u2019s comments on Mayon volcano refer to social media posts, such as this and this, that claim Mayon volcano had been raised to Alert Level 2 recently, stoking fears of another volcano erupting after Taal.\n\nThe image in the Facebook post is also being used in a misleading context; a combination of a reverse image search and keyword search traced the image back to this illustration of a tsunami to MondoWorks design agency.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the MondoWorks image, crediting the artist Chris Wren:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image used in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the MondoWorks image (R):", "lang": "en"}
