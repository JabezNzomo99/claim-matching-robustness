O'Mara represented George Zimmerman, the Orlando-area man who shot and killed Trayvon Martin.\n\n\"The perceived anonymity of digital existence makes it much easier to sort of distance yourself for your own morality,\" said O\u2019Mara on July 16, 2014 on CNN Tonight. \"It\u2019s just what happens because it\u2019s so much easier to be somebody you want to be but know you shouldn't be when you\u2019re online. Literally, by the time a child is 18 years of age, they\u2018ve killed over 100,000 people in video games and other online things.\"\n\nWhether video games lead to real-life violence has been a debate for decades. As for the virtual violence, we were struck by O\u2019Mara\u2019s claim that an 18-year-old has killed over 100,000 people in video games. We wanted to check it out.\n\nWhile O\u2019Mara\u2019s delivery suggests we\u2019d find our answer in some sort of academic journal, his spokesman told us the statistic was \"napkin calculation.\"\n\nMore realistically, it sounds like a guess.\n\n\"(He) may have underestimated that significantly, it could be less than 5 percent of what the real number may be,\" O\u2019Mara spokesman Shawn Vincent said. \"The point is that young people are simulating murders, and witnessing thousands of them on TV.\"\n\nWe were unable to find any study or research that approximates the number of video kills of an 18-year-old, and experts in the field said no such research exists. The problems include the types of games children play, how often they play them, how they play them. Plus, while the vast majority of children play video games, not all do .\n\n\"There's absolutely no way to determine this -- it's too vague,\" said Entertainment Software Association spokesperson Dan Hewitt. \"It's all how a game is played. For example. Grand Theft Auto can be played from beginning to end without harming or \u2018killing\u2019 anyone. Same is true with many games. It's all in how an individual plays it and there's no way to even make an estimate.\"\n\nSo while it\u2019s dangerous to make a broad generalization the way O\u2019Mara did, we can get a sense of what\u2019s happening among gamers who play shooting-style games.\n\nThe take-away: Their virtual personas do a lot of killing.\n\nOne of the best-selling gaming franchises, Halo, estimates that the first three games amassed . We reached out to several players either through Facebook groups or through colleagues to hear about their personal stories.\n\nPete Cruz, 22, has a total kill count of player-versus-player 52,459 on one Halo 3 game. He estimates that this is a pretty average or slightly above average count. Cruz has been playing the Halo games since 2004 and says his total kill count was \"easily 100,000\" when he was 18.\n\n\"More like 150,000 if not more,\" he said. \"That number can easily be reached during your teenage years or from 10 to 19 (years old).\"\n\nJay Manning, 21, estimated he probably reached 100,000 kills in his first six months of playing. Reaching that count by the you\u2019re 18, he agreed, is \"easy.\" Govinda Sessa, 18, has a total kill count of 73,316 over 30 game days in Halo 4. Ben Stuart, 23, put these numbers in context: He averages about 10 to 15 kills per game and has played about 5 or 6 games daily since he was 10 years old. That adds up.\n\nCall of Duty, another popular shooting franchise, hasn\u2019t released recent data since its newest game debuted, said spokesperson Kyle Walker. But from the start of the franchise in 2003 to its second newest game, players have \"respawned\" (come back to life after a player-inflicted death) 1.9 quadrillion times. That\u2019s 15 zeroes.\n\nMarty Maldonado, 21, began playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 when he was 16. He estimates spending two or three hours daily on the game in high school, and says he probably reached 100,000 kills by the time he was 18. But Maldonado is wary of saying these kills were of people.\n\n\"You don't really see them as people, mainly because you're playing a game and you think of the avatar as an extension of the other person's ability,\" he said. \"The only time I would say I felt like I killed someone were emotional games that had good character development like the BioShock series or (the) nuke scene in Call of Duty 4.\"\n\nHalo and Call of Duty are both first-person shooting games, a category of video games that make up about a fifth of the market, according to a Entertainment Software Association . All the gamers and experts we talked to point out that it\u2019s hard to compare total kills.\n\n\"What\u2019d you even consider a kill? Mario stomping? Call of Duty shooting?\" said PC Magazine writer David Murphy.\n\nIn some categories -- action and sports game, for example, which take up about 22 percent and 15 percent of the market respectively -- killing is not even the point. The No. 2 best selling video game of 2012 was Madden NFL 13, a football game in which players aim for touchdowns not deaths. In Assassin\u2019s Creed, a popular action-adventure franchise, the main gameplay involves storylines and missions. Though you do kill in the game, you don't really count the number in an open world game, said player Rahul Prakash.\n\nEven in shooting games, total kill counts don\u2019t account for the many variables in video games and differences in players. Time spent on games, time frame per game, game goals, player age, player level, online or offline, single player versus multiplayer -- these factors all matter and are rarely accounted for, said Cruz.\n\n\"Depending on how that number is constructed, it can definitely lead to misinformation and misconstrue facts about video games,\" he said.\n\nO\u2019Mara said, \"Literally, by the time a child is 18 years of age, they\u2018ve killed over 100,000 people in video games and other online things.\"\n\nLiterally, the stat is a \"napkin calculation.\" Research doesn\u2019t exist on the point and there are too many variables to affect how many people someone might have killed in video game.\n\nThat said, a range of gamers told us that if you play shooting-style games in your teen years, you\u2019re quite likely to kill 100,000 people or more. While that gives O\u2019Mara\u2019s statement some truth, the lack of definitive information makes this claim somewhat dodgy.", "lang": "en"}
