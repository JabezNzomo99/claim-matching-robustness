I\u2019m my own strategist and it wasn\u2019t like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary.\u201d\n\nBannon had been informally advising Trump for months, and the Trump campaign formally announced he would be campaign CEO on Aug. 17, one month after Mr. Trump accepted the GOP nomination.\n\nMr. Trump did not definitively say he has confidence in Bannon, the report said.\n\n\u201cSteve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will,\u201d the president told the newspaper.\n\nCBS News\u2019 Major Garrett reported Monday that on Friday, chief of staff Reince Priebus ordered a face-to-face truce between Bannon and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. The two advisers have held opposing views about key actions taken by the administration. Kushner, for example, supported the cruise missile strikes in Syria. Bannon opposed them.\n\nLast week, Bannon was removed from the Principals Committee of the National Security Council (NSC), though National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster appeared to downplay the move.", "lang": "en"}
