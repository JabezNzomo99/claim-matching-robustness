The user then urges people to tag friends and share it via messaging and news sites.\n\nThe Facebook post has been viewed over 100,000 times, been shared over 900 times and attracted over 800 comments.\n\nOn March 11 the World Health Organization declared the spread of COVID-19 a \u201cpandemic\u201d. Australia has implemented testing regimes, border controls and movement restrictions in the face of an deepening international crisis.\n\nDespite state, national and international health authorities and researchers having found that COVID-19 originated from an animal source and first infected humans in Wuhan, China, numerous conspiracy theories have been advanced, including the belief that 5G is connected to the spread of the viral disease.\n\nThe April 4 post claims that a 5G tower \u201cwas put up OVERNIGHT\u201d in Beaconsfield, which is a suburb south-east of Melbourne\u2019s city centre.\n\nAAP FactCheck has traced the location of the photo back to the Beaconsfield Hub shopping centre. The centre houses shops including the UBE Bar & Eatery and the Glossed Nails and Beauty store pictured in the Facebook post.\n\nA Google Street View image taken of the shopping centre in August, 2019, shows the telecommunications tower in the photo was in the same location then, seven months before the Facebook post and four months before the novel coronavirus was first recorded in China. The image date is visible at the bottom left of the maps screen accessed through the link above.\n\nIn addition to the false claim about a tower being put up during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also no evidence to support the claims of a link between the virus-borne disease and 5G towers.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, made a statement in January saying that 5G technology is safe.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence telecommunication technologies, such as 5G, cause adverse health impacts,\u201d Professor Murphy said.\n\n\u201cThis position is supported by health authorities in Australia \u2013 such as the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) \u2013 and around the world, such as the World Health Organization (WHO).\u201d\n\nConspiracy theories linking COVID-19 and 5G have also spread in the UK, where politicians and government officials have addressed the claims, including cabinet secretary Michael Gove, who described them as \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d.\n\nUK based charity Science Media Centre asked experts about the link between 5G and COVID-19. Those experts stated that there is no sensible link between 5G frequencies and any biological virus or bacteria. \u201cThe idea that COVID19 is caused by 5G mobile phone signals is complete rubbish. This is a disease which numerous doctors and scientists around the world have said is caused by a virus, something completely different to a mobile phone signal,\u201d Dr Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology, University of Reading, told the Centre.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claim that a 5G tower had been erected \u201covernight\u201d in April, 2020 at a Melbourne shopping centre to be false. A Google Street View photo taken August 2019 shows the telecommunications tower has been in the same location since at least that time, well before the COVID-19 crisis began or the new coronavirus was known. False \u2013 The implications of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
