The first time the Kerry made this claim, during a student forum in Ethiopia, his statement mysteriously disappeared from the official State Department transcript.\n\nWhen Kerry opposed the 1991 resolution, he complained that the George H.W. Bush administration had done too little to involve the rest of the world in its campaign to oust Iraq from Kuwait. But in 2002, he praised the coalition that had been formed for the first Gulf War, in part to complain that George W. Bush had thus far failed to secure the same level of cooperation.\n\nWhen Kerry voted for the 2002 resolution, he warned he would not support war if Bush failed to win the support of the international community in the absence of an imminent threat. \u201cLet me be clear, the vote I will give to the president is for one reason and one reason only: To disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, if we cannot accomplish that objective through new, tough weapons inspections in joint concert with our allies,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nBut Kerry also said that the burden to avoid war was on the Iraqi leader: \u201cSaddam Hussein has a choice: He can continue to defy the international community, or he can fulfill his longstanding obligations to disarm. He is the person who has brought the world to this brink of confrontation.\u201d\n\nAs the Los Angeles Times headlined one article in January of that year, \u201cOn Iraq, Kerry Appears Either Torn or Shrewd.\u201d The newspaper noted that \u201cvirtually all of Kerry\u2019s rivals for the 2004 Democratic nomination believe he is trying to straddle the issue by shifting his emphasis at different times and for different audiences.\u201d\n\nIn fact, during a Democratic presidential debate on May 3, two days after Bush prematurely declared \u201cmission accomplished,\u201d Kerry said: \u201cI think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the president made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis war is bigger than just killing Saddam Hussein,\u201d Hagel told CBS News on March 21, 2003. \u201cThe fact is, as we have stated for 12 years, his regime has been in violation of the United Nations resolutions. His regime has possessed, or probably still does possess, weapons of mass destruction. So we shouldn\u2019t personalize it. We should dismantle his regime, disarm his regime and work with the people of Iraq and in that region to give that country a new start, and hopefully that will be a start with democratic institutions and freedom for all people.\u201d\n\nA Kerry aide sent The Fact Checker a few clips of comments that Kerry made in 2004, as he was challenging Bush for the presidency, that that if he had been president and had access to the same intelligence that Bush had, he would not have gone to war in Iraq. But that\u2019s not the same as claiming he opposed the decision to attack Iraq in 2003.\n\nMany politicians have a tendency to look back at their past statements with rose-colored glasses. But given that Kerry has now twice in recent months made the claim that he opposed the war in Iraq, this is clearly not a case of a momentary slip-up.\n\nFor Kerry, the uncomfortable fact remains that he voted to authorize the use of force against Iraq, he believed the intelligence that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and he said there was little choice but to launch an invasion to disarm him. Kerry may have been highly critical of Bush\u2019s diplomatic efforts in advance of the invasion, but that is not the same thing as opposing the war when it started.", "lang": "en"}
