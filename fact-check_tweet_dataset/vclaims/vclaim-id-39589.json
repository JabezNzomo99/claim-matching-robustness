On Oct. 2, Trump\u2019s campaign unveiled a new ad that says, \"It\u2019s nothing short of a coup, and it must be stopped.\"\n\nOn a literal level, Trump is misusing the word. What is happening now is not a coup.\n\nThe defining element of a coup is that it is carried out beyond the bounds of legality.\n\n\"We define a coup d'\u00e9tat as the sudden and irregular (i.e., illegal or extra-legal) removal, or displacement, of the executive authority of an independent government,\" wrote the Coup D\u2019etat Project at the University of Illinois\u2019 Cline Center for Democracy in 2013.\n\nViolence is part of many coups, but being violent is not a necessary condition.\n\nOf the 12 types of coups recognized by the Cline Center, nine do not seem to have anything to do with what Trump is talking about, including military coups, rebel coups, popular revolts, dissident actions, palace coups, foreign coups, internationally mediated transitions, forced resignations, and self-coups, in which the leader strong-arms other branches of government to entrench power.\n\nTwo other types cited by the center are defined by how far they got \u2014 attempted coups (which try and fail) and coup conspiracies (which never get to the stage of being carried out). Any supposed coup against Trump would have been a coup attempt, since he\u2019s still in office. But that doesn\u2019t mean there actually was a coup attempt.\n\nThe Trump camp defended the president\u2019s comments by saying that dictionary definitions allow usages that are more informal than the ones used by academics such as the Cline Center. Merriam-Webster, for instance, says the word can mean \"a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics.\"\n\nThe Trump camp pointed to widespread examples of Democratic lawmakers using \"coup\" to describe the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and to media reports using the word to characterize a 2009 change in leadership in the New York state legislature.\n\nLegal scholars, however, say it\u2019s important for a prominent political figure like Trump to use words as strong as \"coup\" with care.\n\nThey noted that there is nothing beyond the bounds of legality about the impeachment process. Impeachment is explicitly described in the Constitution as the way to remove a president who has committed \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\nYou can\u2019t get much more within the bounds of legality than to be an explicit power outlined in the Constitution, said Michael Klarman, a Harvard Law School professor.\n\n\"It\u2019s obviously not a coup for the House to launch impeachment proceedings,\" Klarman said.\n\nThe lead author of the Cline Center report, University of Illinois political scientist Peter F. Nardulli, called Trump\u2019s usage \"ill-informed.\".\n\n\"What is going on today in the United States is a constitutionally sanctioned process that is an integral part of the checks and balances that have been vital to the longevity and success of the U.S. Constitution and the Republic it created,\" he told PolitiFact.\n\nOf the Cline Center\u2019s categories, Trump would presumably be referring to a \"counter coup,\" which is defined as involving \"the elimination of a usurper by members of the prior regime within a month of the initial coup.\"\n\nBut in Trump\u2019s case, he didn\u2019t take office through a coup (he was duly elected by the Electoral College) and if he is removed from office, his duly elected vice president, Mike Pence, would take over. So calling it a counter coup is problematic, too.", "lang": "en"}
