It had accumulated more than 14000 shares at the time of writing.\n\nIt was also shared by many individuals on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAnother Facebook page India Dekhowhich has more than 37 lakh followers posted a similar claim with a different image. The post has garnered more than 44000 shares.\n\nDoval Fan Club, a Facebook page has also shared the same claim. It has been shared more than 3000 times.\n\nAlt News reverse searched the image shared by Being Hindu on Google and found an old tweet from the official handle of Barack Obama which had the same image. On August 30, 2012, he had tweeted, \u201cPresident Obama is answering your questions in a Reddit AMA, starting right now:\n\nA photograph shared by India Dekho was unrelated to the claims made by the page. This image was clicked by photographer Matthew Healey for Getty Images on August 13, 2013. Obama and his family were on an eight day vacation at Martha\u2019s Vineyard on Massachusetts island during his presidential years. The caption states that Obama was placing an order at a restaurant.\n\nWhile the third image posted by Doval Fan Club was Obama serving Thanksgiving dinner to residents at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, DC. It was clicked by Shawn Thew, a photographer for Associated Press on November 23, 2016. The caption reads, \u201cUnited States President Barack Obama, with First Lady Michelle Obama, shakes hands while serving Thanksgiving dinner to residents at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, DC, USA, 23 November 2016.\u201d\n\nFrom vacations to speeches to international travel, Barack Obama\u2019s life is under constant media scrutiny even after the end of his presidential term. In such a scenario, Obama pursuing a private job would have been reported widely. However, we found no media reports that would suggest that Obama had taken up a private job. According to media, in terms of professional engagements, the Obamas have inked a book deal and an agreement with Netflix.\n\nMichelle and Barack Obama have signed a deal with Netflix to produce a set of films and series. An article published by Reuters on May 21, 2018 stated, \u201cThe Obamas will have hands-on involvement in producing content and will appear personally in some of the shows while curating others, said a person familiar with the deal.\u201d\n\nMichelle and Barack Obama have also inked a multimillion dollar book deal reportedly with Penguin Random House which is pegged anywhere from from $30 million to $65 million for two books.\n\nAccording to report published by CNN Money, Obama\u2019s pension payment will be $207,800, about half of his presidential salary.\n\nFacebook pages like India Dekho and Being Hindu have often been found to make such misleading claims which helps them garner followers and circulation for their posts.", "lang": "en"}
