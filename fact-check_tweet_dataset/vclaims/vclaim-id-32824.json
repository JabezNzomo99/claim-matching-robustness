The rest of the clip was not about Pomoy anymore, rather about the supposed death of Vanessa Bryant \u2013 which Rappler has also previously debunked. As of writing, the channel had uploaded 5 videos \u2013 2 of which were death hoaxes.\n\nPomoy was hailed grand winner of the second season of Pilipinas Got Talent in 2011. He gained wider popularity in 2020 after joining America's Got Talent: The Champions, a special edition of the talent show franchise that brings together fan favorites from the original American edition and standouts from different Got Talent franchises all around the world.", "lang": "en"}
