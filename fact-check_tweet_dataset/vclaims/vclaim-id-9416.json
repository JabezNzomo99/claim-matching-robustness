A black cloth was then placed over my face and the interrogators used a mineral water bottle to pour water on the cloth so that I could not breathe. After a few minutes the cloth was removed and the bed was rotated into an upright position. The pressure of the straps on my wounds caused severe pain. I vomited. The bed was then again lowered to a horizontal position and the same torture carried out with the black cloth over my face and water poured on from a bottle. On this occasion my head was in a more backward, downward position and the water was poured on for a longer time. I struggled without success to breathe. I thought I was going to die. I lost control of my urine. Since then I still lose control of my urine when under stress.\u201d\n\nAt one point, the report says, \u201cKSM had been subjected to more than 65 applications of water during the four waterboarding sessions between the afternoon of March 12, 2003, and the morning of March 13, 2003.\u201d The report added: \u201cOn the afternoon of March 13, 2003, KSM was subjected to his third waterboard session of that calendar day and fifth in 25 hours. CIA records note that KSM vomited during and after the procedure.\u201d\n\nThe CIA inspector general\u2019s 2004 report on the program says that, in the case of Abu Zubaida, most of the pours \u201clasted less than 10 seconds.\u201d The report describes each pour as a \u201cwaterboard application\u201d that it said \u201cconstituted each discrete instance in which water was applied during any period of time during a session.\u201d A review of videotapes (since destroyed) found that interrogators \u201ccontinuously applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainees mouth and nose,\u201d rather than a \u201csmall amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner,\u201d the IG report said.\n\nJames Mitchell, who under contract with the CIA oversaw the interrogations, disputes the Senate footnote. \u201cI know we didn\u2019t go over 40 seconds because the CIA police personnel acting as guards counted off the seconds as water was poured and they had instructions to signal stop before it exceeded 40 seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I doubt that happened. I know we kept the average length of the pours to a similar length as we did for Abu Zubaida, most lasting less than 10 seconds.\u201d\n\nIt would be more precise to explain that this happened in 15 sessions (in other words, an average of 12 times in 20 minutes) and that many of the applications of water may have been only a matter of seconds. But that does not mean that it did not happen 183 and 83 times for Mohammed and Abu Zubaida, respectively.", "lang": "en"}
