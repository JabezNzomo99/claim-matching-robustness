Princeton historian Kevin Kruse called Owens\u2019 statements \"utter nonsense.\"\n\nOwens is a spokesperson for the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA and encourages black people to leave the Democratic Party (calling it \"Blexit\").\n\nOwens did not respond to our emailed request for comment. On Twitter, she said she was referring to the \"myth\" that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress switched parties.\n\nKruse challenged her explanation, saying, \"Owens, predictably, points to the small number of congressmen who switched parties as \u2018proof\u2019 that the larger literature on the racial realignment is a myth \u2014 even though that isn't actually something historians and political scientists emphasize in the work on this.\"\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 Southern strategy has been documented for decades \u2014 including by Republicans who were a part of it.\n\nThe facts about the Southern strategy\n\nFor this fact-check, we interviewed historians and reviewed news articles from the civil rights era.\n\nJoseph Alsop, an influential syndicated newspaper columnist, called it \"basically a segregationist strategy\" in a 1962 column.\n\nWhen Republican Barry Goldwater ran for president in 1964, his Southern surrogates played up the fact that he had just voted against the Civil Rights Act. That paid off in the Deep South where he won a handful of states, but he ultimately lost to Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nBy 1968, the Republicans fine-tuned their approach and packaged it in a way they could win, said Maxwell, the Arkansas professor and an expert on southern politics.\n\nRepublican nominee Richard Nixon reached out to white Southerners by opposing school busing and promising that his administration would not \"ram anything down your throats\" and would appoint \"strict constructionist\" Supreme Court justices.\n\nThe strongest evidence of the Southern strategy comes directly from Republicans at the time.\n\nThat includes Clarence Townes, who served as director of the Minorities Division of the Republican National Committee in the 1960s. Harvard professor Leah Wright Rigueur wrote about Townes in her book \"The Loneliness of the Black Republican.\"\n\nWhen Nixon disbanded the division, Townes told reporters in 1970, \"There\u2019s a total fear of what\u2019s called the Southern strategy. Blacks understand that their wellbeing is being sacrificed to political gain. There has to be some moral leadership from the president on the race question, and there just hasn\u2019t been any.\"\n\nIn 1969, Nixon White House aide Lamar Alexander, who now represents Tennessee in the U.S. Senate, wrote about the Southern strategy in a memo following the unsuccessful Supreme Court nomination of Clement Haynsworth, who was opposed by civil rights groups.\n\n\"SOUTHERN STRATEGY \u2014 we flat out invited the kind of political battle that ultimately erupted when we named a Democrat-turned-Republican conservative from South Carolina. This confirmed the Southern strategy just at a time when it was being nationally debated,\" Alexander wrote.\n\nNixon strategist Kevin Phillips openly discussed the Southern strategy in a newspaper article in 1973:\n\n\"If the New Washington liberal crowd could tear themselves away from Watergate ecstasy and the lionizing of Daniel Ellsberg for a little look-see below the Mason-Dixon line, they might glean a useful political insight, namely that the GOP 'Southern Strategy' seems to be rolling along \u2014 and rolling up local victories \u2014 just as if G. Gordon Liddy had never existed.\" (Ellsberg released the Pentagon papers in 1971 while Liddy was an FBI agent convicted of illegal wiretapping.)\n\nPhillips told the New York Times in 1970 that the Republicans were never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the \"Negro vote and they don't need any more than that.\"\n\n\"The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans,\" he wrote. \"That's where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local Democrats.\"\n\nUltimately, winning over white Southern voters required using coded language, as campaign consultant Lee Atwater, who worked on Reagan\u2019s 1980 campaign, explained in an interview 1981. In audio, he can be heard describing how in 1954, a racial slur could be used to describe black Americans, but that \"backfired\" by 1968 \u2014 requiring a pivot to use more abstract language.\n\n\"So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states\u2019 rights, and all that stuff, and you\u2019re getting so abstract. Now, you\u2019re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you\u2019re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites,\" he said.\n\nReagan used language such as \"states\u2019 rights\" and \"welfare queens,\" which critics said was coded racist language.\n\n\"The partisan shift in the South from the 1960s to George W. Bush is the greatest partisan shift in all of American history,\" Maxwell said.\n\nIn 2005, Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman told the NAACP national convention in Milwaukee that using race as a wedge issue was \"wrong.\"\n\n\"By the \u201870s and into the \u201880s and \u201890s, the Democratic Party solidified its gains in the African American community, and we Republicans did not effectively reach out. Some Republicans gave up on winning the African American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong.\"\n\nOwens said the Southern strategy is a \"myth\" that \"never happened.\"\n\nEfforts by the Republican Party starting in the 1960s to win over white Southern voters have been documented by scholars for decades.\n\nThe strongest evidence that it happened comes from the Republicans who were part of that strategy. There are numerous instances of them talking about the approach in documents or interviews.", "lang": "en"}
