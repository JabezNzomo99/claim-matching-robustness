Both sides said the meeting was a casual encounter, during which the two discussed things like grandchildren and golf \u2014 and not about the Clinton email investigation. But it led to sharp criticism from Clinton\u2019s opponents and led to both Lynch and the Clintons looking bad.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same star that sheriff\u2019s departments across the country use all over the place to represent law enforcement,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cAnd to read into something that isn\u2019t there is \u2014 is \u2014 you know what? I think, again, that\u2019s the mainstream media trying to attack Donald Trump for something that really isn\u2019t there. So, they put a new tweet up with a circle. The message is the same. Let\u2019s look at the message. The message is that Hillary Clinton is corrupt and that the FBI is investigating the leading Democratic front-runner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese false attacks by Hillary Clinton trying to link the Star of David with a basic star, often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior, showing an inscription that says \u201cCrooked Hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever\u201d with anti-Semitism is ridiculous. Clinton, through her surrogates, is just trying to divert attention from the dishonest behavior of herself and her husband. The real questions are, why was Bill Clinton meeting secretly with the US Attorney General on her case and where are the 33,000 missing emails and all of the other information missing from her case \u2013 Why are there so many lies?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe social media graphic used this weekend was not created by the campaign nor was it sourced from an anti-Semitic site. It was lifted from an anti-Hillary Twitter user where countless images appear. The sheriff\u2019s badge \u2013 which is available under Microsoft\u2019s \u201cshapes\u201d \u2013 fit with the theme of corrupt Hillary and that is why I selected it. As the Social Media Director for the campaign, I would never offend anyone and therefore chose to remove the image.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
