Former Vice President Al Gore said that\u2019s \u201cnot true.\u201d Who\u2019s right?\n\nTrump and Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, are correct that one report did estimate a 0.2 C reduction. But the report\u2019s author said the Trump administration \u201ccherry-picked\u201d that figure.\n\nOther studies have shown greater reductions. Estimates differ because researchers make different assumptions at the onset of their calculations, such as whether countries will make more ambitious pledges to reduce carbon emissions in the future.\n\nTrump made his claim about the agreement\u2019s effect on global warming during a June 1 speech announcing that the U.S. would \u201cwithdraw\u201d from the international deal.\n\nThe agreement, which went into effect Nov. 4, 2016, primarily aims to keep warming \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u201d and to pursue \u201cefforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\u201d The planet has warmed nearly 1 C already, according to NASA.\n\nA day after the president\u2019s announcement, Pruitt said \u201ceven if all of the targets were met by all nations across the globe, it only reduced the temperature by less than two-tenths of one degree.\u201d\n\nGore, who shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for increasing public knowledge about climate change, was asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on June 4 about the statements made by Trump and Pruitt.\n\n\u201cWell, first of all, it\u2019s not true,\u201d Gore said, adding that the Paris Agreement \u201cgives tremendous momentum\u201d to reducing global warming.\n\nWe reached out to spokespeople for Gore, Trump and Pruitt for support for their claims. Gore\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond. The White House also didn\u2019t respond, but in a video posted to Facebook on June 1, it cites research out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to support the claim that \u201cif every member nation met all of their commitments [under the Paris Agreement] through this century, the impact on the climate would be negligible.\u201d EPA spokesperson Liz Bowman also pointed us to the 2015 MIT report.\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries submit pledges that outline their emissions targets and other aims related to mitigating and adapting to climate change. Countries must submit new pledges every five years. These pledges should grow more ambitious over time, the agreement stipulates, although the targets are voluntary and there are no penalties for failing to meet them.\n\nThe MIT report looked at the effect that the majority of the first set of pledges would have on warming by 2100. In their report, the MIT researchers assumed countries wouldn\u2019t make additional, more ambitious pledges.\n\n\u201cAssuming the proposed cuts [under the Paris Agreement] are extended through 2100 but not deepened further, they result in about 0.2\u00b0C less warming by the end of the century,\u201d the report said.\n\nTo come up with that estimate, the researchers compared the bulk of the Paris pledges\u2019 impact on warming with the impact of emissions targets set under climate agreements made in Copenhagen in 2009 and Cancun in 2010. As we\u2019ll explain below, other studies that found larger reductions compared the Paris pledges with other baselines, such as climate policies in place since 2005.\n\nOn June 8, John Reilly, the co-director of MIT\u2019s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change and co-author of the 2015 report, published an op-ed in the Washington Post, in which he argued that the Trump \u201cadministration cherry-picked [his] group\u2019s findings to help make their case.\u201d\n\nThe Paris Agreement builds on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and was signed by all but two of the 197 countries party to the convention. Reilly argues it\u2019s the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of all commitments made under this framework that\u2019s the \u201crelevant number, not 0.2 degrees.\u201d The 0.2 C figure, in other words, \u201creflects only the incremental effect of Paris when built upon all the previous commitments made through the UNFCCC.\u201d\n\nThe 0.2 C estimate also doesn\u2019t take into consideration the full potential effect of the Paris Agreement alone. In calculating the 0.2 C figure, Reilly and his colleagues \u201cassumed no further strengthening of national commitments in years after 2030,\u201d which is another \u201ccritically important\u201d distinction, he says.\n\nBowman at the EPA also cited a 2015 paper by Bjorn Lomborg, the president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center in Denmark. Lomborg authored the 2001 book \u201cThe Skeptical Environmentalist,\u201d in which he writes that global warming is \u201ctaking place,\u201d but that cutting back fossil fuels will create greater problems for the world than global warming. Other scientists have criticized Lomborg\u2019s book.\n\nPublished in the journal Global Policy in November 2015, Lomborg\u2019s study compared warming under a business-as-usual scenario to warming with the Paris pledges. He concluded that the difference is about 0.17 C in 2100.\n\nUnlike the MIT report and Lomborg\u2019s paper, other studies that found greater reductions did assume countries would make more ambitious pledges in the future, as the agreement specifies.\n\nSo what is the \u201crelevant number,\u201d as Reilly put it?\n\nThe MIT researcher points to one analysis by the climate modeling nonprofit Climate Interactive that found that national contributions made by UNFCCC parties to date, which include the Paris Agreement pledges, would result in roughly 3.3 C of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100. That\u2019s compared with 4.2 C of warming for business as usual, a 0.9 C difference.\n\nRoughly 1 degree \u201cmight not sound like a lot,\u201d explains Reilly, but it\u2019s actually the amount of warming that the planet \u201chas experienced in roughly the past century and a half, and in that time we\u2019ve observed retreating mountain glaciers, rising sea levels and other significant impacts.\u201d\n\nCarl-Friedrich Schleussner, a climate physicist at Climate Analytics, a nonprofit climate science and policy institute in Germany, also put the 0.2 C figure into context for us. He said it\u2019s subjective whether or not something is \u201ctiny.\u201d Still, \u201cA few systems are particularly sensitive to also small warming increments,\u201d Schleussner told us by email. These systems include tropical coral reef bleaching, \u201cfor which every tenth of a degree matters,\u201d and Arctic sea-ice melting, he added.\n\nAnother analysis by Joeri Rogelj, an energy modeling and climate policy expert at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, and others took a more nuanced approach to estimating the impact of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nPublished in the journal Nature in June 2016, Rogelj\u2019s study looks at four scenarios that each make different assumptions about global effort to reduce warming by 2100:\n\u2022 No new climate policies since 2005.\n\u2022 All global climate commitments, excluding those under the Paris Agreement.\n\u2022 All global climate commitments including those under the Paris Agreement, but excluding those with financial aid conditions.\n\u2022 All global climate commitments including those under the Paris Agreement with or without financial aid conditions.\n\nThe researchers also took into consideration three different probabilities for the four different scenarios. For example, they estimated there\u2019s a 90 percent probability warming would be around 3.7 C under scenario four. They also estimated warming under this scenario would be limited to 2.7 C, but only with a 50 percent probability.\n\nThe researchers note that UNFCCC policymakers have been satisfied with a 66 percent probability when discussing policies to keep warming below 2 C. Under this probability level, total warming ranges from 3 C for scenario four to 4.5 C for scenario one. But what about the reductions due to the Paris Agreement pledges specifically?\n\nWhen comparing the level of warming for all Paris Agreement pledges, regardless of financial aid conditions (scenario four), with all climate policies excluding the Paris Agreement (scenario two), the difference is 0.6 C, more than the MIT researchers\u2019 estimate of 0.2 C.\n\nUnlike the MIT researchers, Rogelj and his group assumed pledges would continue to become progressively more ambitious over time because, \u201c[s]talling climate action after 2030 would be in contradiction with the provisions of the Paris Agreement,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nStill, in their review of the scientific literature, the researchers found that studies came to \u201ca wide range of estimates of future emissions under nominally similar scenarios.\u201d How much greenhouse gas emissions are put into the atmosphere directly relates to how much the planet will warm, so if researchers have different estimates of emissions, they will also have different estimates for warming.\n\nFor example, countries didn\u2019t submit their pledges under the Paris Agreement all in the same format. Some provided their emissions targets in an absolute format, such as a percentage reduction compared with some baseline. Other countries provided targets in terms of \u201cemissions intensity,\u201d which is a ratio of emissions to economic output. Some countries provided no specific emissions target at all and instead pledged to increase their share of renewable energy or cut their use of fossil fuels.\n\nResearchers have to translate all of these different quantities into an absolute emissions format in order to come up with an estimate for total warming. And they might not all make these conversions in the same way. Hence, they come to different estimates for warming.\n\nIn short, the assumptions researchers make when calculating global average temperature reductions due to the Paris Agreement influence their final estimates. There are a range of estimates that make different assumptions, and 0.2 C is one of those estimates.\n\nSo, while Trump is right about the estimate from one particular study, a co-author of that report says a more \u201crelevant\u201d estimate of the Paris Agreement\u2019s impact on warming is closer to 1 C. That researcher also disputed the Trump administration\u2019s characterization of the total reduction as \u201cnegligible.\u201d\n\nEven if 0.2 C was the relevant figure, it\u2019s not a negligible quantity when it comes to tropical coral reef bleaching or Arctic sea ice melting.", "lang": "en"}
