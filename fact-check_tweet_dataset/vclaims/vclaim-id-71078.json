We recall that Lehmberg took office as district attorney about three years ago.\n\nSo, how does Baird get to his 30 years of the office being under the same leadership?\n\n \n\n In an interview, Baird told us Lehmberg started working for the Travis County district attorney\u2019s office before Ronnie Earle won his first term as DA in the 1970s. Baird also specified about 10 of Lehmberg\u2019s deputies or section chiefs who he said had been with the office for an \"extraordinarily long time.\"\n\n \n\n A day later, Baird called back to say that his leaflet statement was based only on the tenures of Earle and Lehmberg -- and not time served by any longstanding deputies.\n\n \n\n All righty, let\u2019s count.\n\n \n\n Earle became the district attorney in 1977, the Austin American-Statesman noted in a December 2007 news article on his decision not to run again in 2008.\n\n \n\n According to Lehmberg\u2019s biographical entry on the office\u2019s website, she left private law practice to join the DA\u2019s office in 1976. The entry continues: \"Rosemary began her career with the district attorney working with the Grand Jury and then as a trial attorney in the 167th District Court, presided over by Judge Tom Blackwell. She later became chief of that court and then the chief of the Trial Division. She has served as the chief of the Career Criminal, Major Crimes and Public Integrity Divisions.\"\n\n \n\n The entry continues: \"In 1988, Rosemary became director of the Family Justice Division. While director, she was a founder of the Travis County Children's Advocacy Center, now the Center for Child Protection... Rosemary served as First Assistant District Attorney from 1997 until 2009, when she was elected District Attorney. She took office in January 2009, the first woman district attorney in Travis County history.\"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n The Travis County DA\u2019s office had two elected leaders over 35 years, from 1977 through 2011. Earle was the district attorney for 32 of those years, leaving office after voters elected Lehmberg, who earlier held several leadership roles under Earle and, significantly, was his first assistant for a dozen years.\n\n \n\n Counting her time as the first assistant district attorney, it\u2019s fair to say Lehmberg has been a key leader of the office for 15 years.\n\nHowever, Earle -- who is no longer there -- was the office\u2019s leader most of the leaflet\u2019s proclaimed 30 years.\n\n \n\n We rate Baird\u2019s claim as Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
