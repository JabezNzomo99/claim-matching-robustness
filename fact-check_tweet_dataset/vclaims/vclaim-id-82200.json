(There can also be a negotiation over the value of a trade-in.) Consumers can come into a dealer with a pre-approved annual percentage rate (APR) from a lending institution, such a credit union, or they can get financing from the car dealer. The dealer typically will send an application to various lenders to get quotes.\n\nWhether someone would get a better rate from the auto dealer is open to question, since dealers expect to get paid for their work in arranging the loan. That compensation is known as the \u201cdealer reserve.\u201d But you can haggle over the rate from the auto dealer. \u201cTry to negotiate the lowest APR with the dealer, just as you would negotiate the best price for the vehicle,\u201d the Federal Trade Commission advises.\n\nThe dealer has the option of adjusting the APR (to below a bank\u2019s APR) by reducing its compensation in order to facilitate the sale. Dealers also may tout low or even zero percent financing offers for certain model cars. At the same time, that dealer discretion may result in higher rates for people with poor credit (or who do not negotiate well). Consumer advocates and academic studies also say there is evidence of racial disparities in rates that are offered. We are not defending auto sales tactics, but wanted to examine how this $26 billion figure was reached.\n\nThe CRL report is based on 2009 data, in the depths of the financial crisis, and has not been updated. Although the report says that the \u201ctotal rate markup volume\u201d was $25.8 billion, it does not fully explain how that figure was calculated. A chart in the report says the key information about the dealer reserve was derived from an annual survey published by the National Automotive Finance Association, which is a membership organization of lenders who specialize in \u201csubprime\u201d loans to people with poor credit.\n\nThat\u2019s right. This is data on the subprime market, a fact that CRL does not disclose in its report. CRL took the data and applied it to the entire auto loan market, even though subprime loans were only one-fifth of the auto-loan market in 2009. Moreover, just 25 of the 175 companies that were in the subprime auto loan market at the time participated in the survey. Four respondents were deemed \u201clarge\u201d lenders with more than 80,000 loans outstanding, while 10 respondents had fewer than 10,000 accounts. (In fact, only one company that answered the survey is one of the top 20 lenders.)\n\nBut there\u2019s a bigger problem. The numbers in the CRL report do not match up with the numbers in the NAF survey. The CRL report says the average markup per used car loan was $780, but the NAF survey says it was $280. For new cars, CRL says $494 but the NAF survey lists $477. CRL says the average reserve was $714 but the NAF survey says $330.\n\nWe won\u2019t bore you with the math. But calculations based on the data for auto-financed sales in the CRL report and the stated NAF survey estimates for dealer reserves yield a figure of $11.76 billion, or less than half the figure in the report. That may seem like a big number, but remember, it\u2019s based on data that is a subset of a subset of the overall auto loan market, so it\u2019s practically meaningless.\n\nIn 1977, the Federal Reserve Bank rejected a proposal that would have required auto dealers, as part of the Truth in Lending Act, to disclose how much of the finance charge they receive for arranging a loan. \u201cIn most instances, the portion of the finance charge which represents the dealer\u2019s participation is not an amount which the consumer could save by obtaining a direct loan from a lending institution,\u201d the board concluded.\n\nAs regular readers know, we hold politicians accountable for the accuracy of sources they cite. There are enough warning flags in the CRL report \u2014 such as its lack of transparency on how the $26 billion number was calculated \u2014 that would have given a close reader pause. The National Automobile Dealers Association in 2012 submitted to the FTC a lengthy rebuttal of the report that also raised serious questions about the research.", "lang": "en"}
