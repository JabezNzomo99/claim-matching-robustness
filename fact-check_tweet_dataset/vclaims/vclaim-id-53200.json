There is no such amendment.\n\n\n\nThere are 27 amendments to the U.S. Constitution, but a meme circulating online has added another one.\n\nIn a script font on parchment background, the meme claims the \u201cAmendment 28\u201d says: \u201cCongress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and Representatives: and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and Representatives that does not apply equally to the Citizens of the United States.\u201d\n\nAbove that, the meme says: \u201cThe 28th Amendment hasn\u2019t been upheld in years.\u201d\n\nBut, of course, there is no \u201c28th Amendment.\u201d What this meme purports to show as an amendment to the Constitution is actually adopted, verbatim, from a suggestion for a constitutional amendment included in an old chain email. The chain email had claimed, wrongly, that public officials were exempt from certain laws. We wrote about it when the email was circulating in 2010.\n\nMore recently, we wrote about a similar falsehood circulating on social media. Facebook posts in September claimed that President Donald Trump was pushing for a made-up piece of legislation that would have, in part, required all members of Congress to \u201cabide by all laws they impose on the American people.\u201d But, as we wrote, the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act requires members to follow more than a dozen civil rights, labor, and workplace safety laws that apply to private businesses.\n\nRegardless, some lawmakers have proposed constitutional amendments that are similar to the meme circulating now. In 2013, for example, Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, introduced a resolution that would have made this amendment to the Constitution: \u201cCongress shall make no law applicable to a citizen of the United States that is not equally applicable to Congress.\u201d\n\nPaul said that his proposed amendment was a response to the Affordable Care Act, which some Republicans misleadingly claimed at the time had provided a \u201cspecial subsidy\u201d for members of Congress and their staffs to purchase health insurance. We debunked that claim in 2013, around the same time that Paul introduced his amendment.\n\nPaul\u2019s proposed amendment died in committee, and failed again when he reintroduced it in the next Congress. Similar proposals in the House failed, too.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
