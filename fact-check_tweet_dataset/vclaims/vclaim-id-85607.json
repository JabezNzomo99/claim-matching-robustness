McCaskill has led the charge for repealing the law.\n\nMcCaskill, in the CNN interview, stated that she was not in Congress at the time and she would \u201clike to believe\u201d she would have objected to it. (The bill passed the Senate under unanimous consent, meaning one senator was needed to object to it in order for a recorded vote.) In an interview on NPR on Oct. 17, in which McCaskill called on Trump to withdraw Marino\u2019s nomination, host David Greene noted to her: \u201cI know you were dealing with some health issues and did not take a vote on this.\u201d McCaskill raised no objection.\n\nReaders may recall that McCaskill once claimed she had never met with the Russian ambassador \u2014 even though she had tweeted about a meeting. What does the record show about McCaskill\u2019s presence in Washington at the time of the DEA bill?\n\nBut on March 14, USA Today reported that McCaskill \u201cdove back into the legislative and political arena on Monday, returning to Washington after three weeks of intensive treatment for breast cancer in St. Louis.\u201d She held a 30-minute call that day to tell reporters she was back at work.\n\nOn March 17, the day the DEA bill was approved, she voted at 1:43 p.m. to approve a resolution holding the chief executive of the website backpage.com in contempt for allegedly refusing to cooperate in an investigation of sex trafficking. McCaskill even appeared on the floor to make the case for approval of the resolution.\n\nSo, despite her claim that she \u201cwasn\u2019t here at the time,\u201d McCaskill was clearly back at the Senate, participating in votes and hearings.\n\nMcCaskill\u2019s staff acknowledged the error, saying that they had forgotten she had come back at that time. \u201cIt was sloppy on our part, and we take responsibility,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nMcCaskill for two days has left the impression that she was away from the Senate, dealing with health issues, when the bill hobbling the DEA was passed.\n\nOn Oct. 16, she told CNN she was away that week, dealing with her breast cancer. Then, a day later, she was silent when an NPR host asserted she was absent from the Senate that day because of her health issues. She should have said she had checked her schedule and that was a mistake.\n\nShe told CNN she\u2019d \u201clike to believe\u201d she would have opposed the bill and stopped it. But the reality is that she was there \u2014 and she missed the opportunity that she seeks now. She earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
