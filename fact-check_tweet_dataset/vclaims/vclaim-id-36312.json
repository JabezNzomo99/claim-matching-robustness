Nor is there a specific treatment for the viral respiratory illness.\n\nAs of Feb. 12, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 45,171 confirmed cases of the novel respiratory virus, with 44,730 of those cases in China and 441 in other countries. The coronavirus, which has killed some 1,115 people, is believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\nThe post features an alleged screen grab of a chyron from a live news broadcast, saying, \u201cBreaking News: Weed Kills Corona Virus.\u201d Scientists were shocked by the discovery, a ticker beneath the headline claims.\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports that scientists have discovered marijuana can cure or treat the novel coronavirus. The screen grab appears to have been made on one of the many websites that allow people to create their own breaking news chyrons. The bud photo can be found on a stock image website.\n\nTarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson, told the Caller \u201cthere is no known cure at this point.\u201d Nor does a specific treatment for the novel coronavirus exist, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In fact, the WHO website states taking supplements and smoking are ineffective and can even be harmful when used as remedies for coronavirus.\n\nChinese scientists are currently testing antiviral drugs against the new coronavirus, according to Reuters.", "lang": "en"}
