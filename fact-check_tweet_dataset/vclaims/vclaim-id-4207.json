It originated days earlier on the website Daily World Update, which publishes fictitious stories that it labels satire. But its stories are often republished elsewhere and treated as fact. Politicslive.net does not include a disclaimer about the story being satire, for example.\n\nThe fictitious report claims that Eastwood (who\u2019s 87, not 89, as the story says) has been told by doctors to \u201cget his affairs in order\u201d because he is near death. It also features a number of supposed statements made by Eastwood that we could not locate anywhere other than the made-up story. Likewise, we could find no credible reports stating that Eastwood\u2019s health is declining.\n\n\u201cEastwood is donating his Northern California ranch, 40K acres of grazing land in Nevada and more than $7 million in cash and other assets to Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign,\u201d the story continues. \u201cThe campaign has said they will be delighted to accept the donation and will use the ranch as a command center for the entire Pacific Northwest.\u201d\n\nOn Facebook, some suspected the story to be false. \u201cI\u2019m calling Fake News on this one,\u201d one user wrote. But others welcomed the false news, indicating that they believed it. \u201cWhat a great American, God bless you and your family,\u201d another user commented.\n\nEastwood, a self-described libertarian who spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention, did express support for Trump in an Esquire interview ahead of the 2016 election (though he noted he hadn\u2019t \u201cendorsed anybody\u201d).\n\nWhen he was pressed by the interviewer to choose between Trump or rival Hillary Clinton, Eastwood responded: \u201cThat\u2019s a tough one, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019d have to go for Trump \u2026 you know, \u2019cause she\u2019s declared that she\u2019s gonna follow in Obama\u2019s footsteps. There\u2019s been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cClint Eastwood Leaves His Estate To The Trump 2020 Campaign.\u201d Daily World Update. 27 Apr 2018.\n\n\u201cClint Eastwood Leaves His Estate To The Trump 2020 Campaign.\u201d Politicslive.net. 1 May 2018.\n\nHainey, Michael. \u201cClint and Scott Eastwood: No Holds Barred in Their First Interview Together.\u201d Esquire. 3 Aug 2016.", "lang": "en"}
