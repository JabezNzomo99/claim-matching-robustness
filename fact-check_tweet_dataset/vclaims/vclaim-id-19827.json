Ishchenko claimed that despite American attempts to disrupt Russo-Chinese economic unity, the One Belt One Road Forum for International Cooperation, held in Beijing on May 14-15, confirmed that Russia and China are moving towards deepening economic relations in the framework of the Chinese New Silk Road initiative.One Belt One Road is a development strategy proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping that focuses on cooperation between Eurasian countries.\n\n \n\n Polygraph.info found that Ishchenko is misrepresenting the current state of the Russia-China economic partnership and is trying to blame Washington for Moscow\u2019s failures to deepen its economic ties with China. Experts told Polygraph.info that China does not view Russia as an equal partner in economic relations and does not share Russia\u2019s perception of its importance to Chinese economic plans.\n\n \n\n Ishchenko claimed the Arab Spring was one of the disruptive steps taken by the United States, and \u201cwas supposed to destabilize the Middle East for a long time.\u201d He wrote that the subsequent \"destruction of North Africa (from Tunisia to Egypt), Syria, and then Turkey, would have completely blocked the southern flank of the new Great Silk Road.\u201d\n\n \n\n \u201cThis is utter nonsense,\u201d Stephen Blank of the American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC) told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cWe did not start the Arab Spring. It was the intrinsic movement within the Arab countries against the misgovernment that we saw in countries like Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and Syria,\" he said. \"The last thing we want is an unstable Middle East! And quite frankly, we supported the Chinese Silk Road in China, in Central Asia initially, and that is a matter of public record.\u201d\n\n \n\n Daniel Blumenthal, director of Asian Studies and a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), told Polygraph.info that Russia and China share the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d about alleged U.S. involvement in the Arab Spring, and that both believe the United States \u201cis behind every effort in the world to topple the regimes.\u201d\n\n \n\n While Moscow and Beijing may share this theory, the experts contacted by Polygraph.info said Ishchenko\u2019s argument that the United States destabilized both the Middle East and Ukraine in order to sabotage Russo-Chinese economic relations is completely unsubstantiated. They also said that current and potential economic ties between Russian and China are not nearly as close as Ishchenko portrays.\n\n \n\n In fact, according to AEI\u2019s Blumenthal, Russia and China have concerns about each other\u2019s intentions. \u201cRussia is very concerned about the Chinese One Belt One Road initiative,\u201d while China is \u201cwary of the fact that Russia views Central Asia as its sphere of influence,\u201d he said. However, he added that this mutual distrust \u201cis not going to stop China\u201d from moving forward with its plans.\n\n \n\n While the economic success of the One Belt One Road initiative \u201ccould be very mixed,\u201d Blumenthal said China would succeed politically by \u201cbuilding influence through certain direct investments in places where it wants to build influence. That would be in Central Asia, and South Asia.\u201d Chinese political influence in Central Asia is something that Moscow cannot accept easily, and therefore, he said \u201cRussia is more concerned about China and its moves in Central Asia than the other way around.\u201d\n\n \n\n Chinese-Russian economic ties are mainly limited to energy exports and weapons sales, which create an unequal balance in the partnership. China has pledged investments in Russia, but some of the largest projects are still only at the discussion phase.\n\n \n\n \u201cRussia\u2019s failure to reform its economy and make it competitive is what lays at the root of this,\u201d said the AFPC\u2019s Blank. \u201cThey thought that the Chinese would give them all this money because they have an inflated idea of their importance to China, but this does not fool anybody in Beijing.\u201d\n\n \n\n China does not see Russia as an equal partner, the experts told Polygraph.info. To Beijing, Russia is a weapons supplier, an important oil exporter, and a country that takes on the United States. \u201cRussia will be a supplier of energy to China and China will have to decide whether it is going to spend a lot of cash on the Russian energy infrastructure,\u201d said Blumenthal.\n\n \n\n In addition, Chinese banks have limited their loans to Russian businesses. This may be in part due to U.S. actions, but those actions are not aimed at sabotaging the Russo-Chinese economic relations. Chinese banks, as major international financial players, are enforcing the sanctions the West imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea.\n\n \n\n \u201cThe Chinese banks do not want to get in trouble with the U.S. Treasury Department,\u201d said Blank. \u201cRussia is a very small player, relatively speaking, in China's international economic design. Oil and gas is strategic, as (are) weapons, but the numbers do not come anywhere close to the level of business China is doing with the United States. Obviously, bankers are not going to make trouble for themselves.\u201d\n\n \n\n The experts told Polgraph.info that China would not follow through on all of its promised investments under the One Belt One Road initiative, and that potential partner countries would not borrow enough from Beijing to make projects viable and sustainable.\n\n \n\n \u201cThe Chinese do not see a lot of financially strong customers out there. So there is no win-win, for all of the rhetoric,\u201d said Blank.", "lang": "en"}
