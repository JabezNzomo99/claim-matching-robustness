Many of these countries didn't recognize Maduro\u2019s controversial reelection in 2018. His original term ended on January 10, 2019.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "February 04, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-26916", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-senator-u-s-no-right-venezuelan-but-ok-russia-does-fact-check/29751150.html", "vclaim": "On January 30, the Russian state-owned media outlet RIA Novosti reported that Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the International Affairs Committee of Russia\u2019s Federation Council (upper house of parliament), said Russia does not recognize Venezuelan opposition leader and National Assembly President Juan Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s interim president.\n\nThat same article quotes Kosachev as saying, that no foreign country including the United States has a right to \u201cdetermine\u201d who is Venezuelan president, labeling an act of recognition as an attempt to interfere with the nation\u2019s domestic affairs and impose the Venezuelan people\u2019s choice of a leader. If that is true, then Russia is doing the same by declaring it does not recognize Guaido\u2019s status.\n\nOn January 10, Venezuela\u2019s opposition-backed National Assembly declared its president, Juan Guaido, to be the country\u2019s acting president. That same day, de facto Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s original six-year term was set to expire. Maduro won another presidential term in May 2018 in an election heavily criticized both inside and outside of Venezuela for its restrictions on opposition parties as well as low turnout (around 20 percent). Because the National Assembly does not recognize the legitimacy of Maduro\u2019s reelection, the body asserts that, according to the Venezuelan constitution, it is empowered to appoint the Assembly president as the country\u2019s interim acting president. For his part, Guaido is calling for new elections to choose a president.\n\nSince Guaido was declared interim president, numerous countries, including the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Australia and most European Union countries, have recognized the National Assembly\u2019s decision as legitimate and thereby recognize Guaido as interim president. Russia, China, Iran, Nicaragua, Cuba and Turkey, among others, back Maduro as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president. More countries have recognized Guaido\u2019s claim than have backed Maduro, but international recognition, while boosting legitimacy, is not the same as choosing the country\u2019s president.\n\nOn Monday, February 4, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt tweeted that because Maduro had failed to call for new presidential elections, Britain would no longer recognize him as the legitimate president of Venezuela and instead recognize Juan Guaido as interim president. The Russian Embassy in Great Britain\u2019s official Twitter account responded by claiming that this constituted a violation of international law. It does not, as states are allowed to recognize or refuse to recognize other states or governments at their own discretion.\n\nThere has been criticism of the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric on Venezuela since the crisis began. While many nations recognize Guaido as interim president, including Spain and Ecuador, which are led by left-leaning social democrats, others have criticized what they see as Washington\u2019s more belligerent tone toward the Maduro government, saying it could backfire. Fears of U.S. military intervention were raised when U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton was photographed at a press briefing holding a legal pad with the note \u201c5,000 troops to Colombia\u201d written on it. Bolton later told the press that \u201call options are on the table\u201d but denied any military action was being planned.\n\nWhile many Venezuelans -- including those who once supported Maduro\u2019s predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez -- have taken to the streets to protest the regime, reports say most of the Venezuelan military appears to be sticking with Maduro. Guaido has offered an amnesty to military officers and other regime officials in hopes of averting violence.", "lang": "en"}
