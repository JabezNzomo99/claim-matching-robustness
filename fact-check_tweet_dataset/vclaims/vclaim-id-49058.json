Additionally, an aid to the House Speaker said Pelosi used the phrase \"guaranteed incomes\" to mean that workers should be guaranteed paychecks \u2014 not that the country should implement universal basic income.\n\nIn spring 2020, Pelosi said she wanted federal leaders to consider \"guaranteed incomes\" to help Americans survive the COVID-19 economic crisis. One of the references was during a call with journalists to discuss ways for the federal government to boost aid for foreign-born people without Social Security numbers, which includes immigrants who don't have legal status.\n\nOn May 4, 2020 \u2014 as federal leaders debated how to respond to an unprecedented interruption to the U.S. economy due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic \u2014 a conservative provocateur tweeted that U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wanted the country\u2019s next economic relief package to establish \u201cguaranteed minimum incomes\u201d for \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d\n\nSuggesting that only legal U.S. residents should benefit from federal stimulus packages, Charlie Kirk \u2014 who\u2019s the founder of the conservative political group Turning Point USA and social media ally of U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 said in the tweet to his roughly 1.7 million followers:\n\nTo investigate the validity of his claim, we examined Pelosi\u2019s public statements and media appearances to determine if, or when, she used the phrased \u201cguaranteed income\u201d \u2014 and under what circumstances.\n\nWhile Kirk provides no explanation for where or when or to whom Pelosi made the remarks in the above-displayed tweet \u2014 aside from the tweet\u2019s indication with the word \u201cBREAKING\u201d that the House Speaker had made the comments shortly before he composed the post \u2014 we considered statements by Pelosi since the beginning of the COVID-19 U.S. outbreak in early 2020 for our investigation. Within that timeframe, she used or referenced the phrase \u201cguaranteed income\u201d in three public statements, two of which were televised interviews.\n\nFirst, the House Speaker spoke the words on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d on April 24. In light of the federal government\u2019s approval of the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March 2020 (and stimulus bills totaling about $500 billion since then), Maher asked Pelosi if the federal government could afford similar economic relief packages for Americans should the pandemic keep businesses closed and systems locked down in the coming months. She responded:\n\nShe provided no further details on the so-called proposals for \u201cguaranteed income,\u201d which generally refers to a government-imposed system so that every citizen receives a minimum income \u2014 a central idea of the 2020 presidential campaign by former Democratic candidate Andrew Yang. Also in the conversation with Maher, Pelosi did not explicitly state that she wanted the system implemented via Congressional legislation.\n\nThree days later, however, the House Speaker again said the words \u201cguaranteed income\u201d in a televised interview, this time with more specificity on her openness to the social welfare system. In the April 27 segment of MSNBC\u2018s \u201cLive with Stephanie Ruhle,\u201d while explaining federal leaders\u2019 next steps to help small businesses survive the financial crisis, Pelosi said:\n\nAs we go forward, let\u2019s see what works: what is operational and what needs other attention. Others have suggested a minimum income for \u2014 a guaranteed income for \u2014 people. Is that worthy of attention now? Perhaps so, because there are many more people than just in small business and hired by small business, as important as that is to the vitality of our economy. And other people who are not in the public sector, you know, meeting our needs in so many ways, that may need some assistance as well.\n\nSoon after she made the statement on live TV, news outlets including CBS News and CNBC published stories with headlines such as, \u201cPelosi says \u2018guaranteed income\u2019 for Americans is worth considering for coronavirus recovery.\u201d In a story by Business Insider about the televised comments, an aid to Pelosi said the House Speaker was referring to proposals that would guarantee worker paychecks \u2014 not a sweeping system for universal basic income.\n\nThen, on May 1, the House Speaker and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus made themselves available to journalists via a conference call to discuss provisions within the CARES Act that exclude immigrants without Social Security numbers from receiving one-time stimulus checks.\n\nIn the call, Pelosi expressed support for legislation that would guarantee COVID-19 economic relief to not only people with Social Security numbers but also immigrants and their families who use Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs), which the IRS assigns to workers without Social Security numbers, to pay annual taxes.\n\nAccording to the IRS, the federal agency issues the numbers \u201cregardless of immigration status, because both resident and nonresident aliens may have a U.S. filing or reporting requirement under the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d In other words, some immigrants who use the identification numbers (ITINs) \u2014 not social security numbers \u2014 to pay taxes may be \u201cundocumented.\u201d\n\nAccording to a transcript of the May 1 call, at one point a reporter asked Pelosi:\n\nIn her response, Pelosi reiterated that she thinks federal leaders should consider guaranteed income and that she would talk to chairs of House committees about exploring the idea further. Additionally, as they consider future economic benefits for Americans during the pandemic, she said:\n\nAny way we go down the path that [ITINs] should apply, whether it\u2019s direct payments, whether it\u2019s participation in PPP (the federal Paycheck Protection Plan loan program)\u2026 I said it [guaranteed income] should be considered. And, why it should be considered, in my view, is because there is a lot of money, federal taxpayer dollars, going out the door. Whether it\u2019s PPP, whether it\u2019s Unemployment Insurance, whether it\u2019s direct payments \u2026 But, whatever we do, I think the tax number is an easy entr\u00e9e to many more people who deserve it, who should get this, but are being cut out now, in whatever it is that we are putting out there.\n\nGiven the nature of and circumstances surrounding the May 1 call, and considering the fact that Pelosi did not mention \u201cguaranteed income\u201d in any other public statements after the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak and before Kirk\u2019s viral posting, we determined it to be the most likely source of inspiration for his May 4 tweet.\n\nHowever, though Pelosi said she wants people who use ITINs to receive economic relief from the federal government during the pandemic \u2014 a group that would include \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants \u2014 she did not say she wants the government to provide stimulus payments to all \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants. Additionally, the House Speaker said she wanted federal leaders to consider, not implement, \u201cguaranteed income\u201d for Americans, unlike what Kirk\u2019s tweet implies.\n\nIn sum, given those reasons \u2014 as well as the lack of clarity for what Pelosi means by the phrase \u201cguaranteed income,\u201d the context in which she made the comments analyzed above, and the fact that she did say she wanted future stimulus money to help foreign people without Social Security numbers \u2014 we rate this claim as \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
