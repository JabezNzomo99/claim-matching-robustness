He had given an \"ultimatum\" to the Delhi police to clear the area, otherwise, he had said, they would have to hit the streets. What followed afterwards was Delhi riots killing 53 people. The photograph that is doing the rounds has a watermark that reads 'coastaldigest.com'.\n\nA Google reverse search of the image led to a report by Coastaldigest.com from 2016, which carried the viral photo and google suggested \"Ashita Shakeel\" as text hint of the image.\n\nAccording to the report, the photograph shows MBA graduates Ashitha (Hindu) and Shakeel Ahmed (Muslim) who got married in Mysuru in April 2016. The marriage ceremony was conducted peacefully amidst tight security due to threats from \"Hindutva extremists\".\n\nNDTV had also uploaded a video from the wedding on their youtube channel, back in 2016. According to the description of the video,\"right-wing Hindu activists\" had protested against the wedding calling it \"love jihad\" and alleging that Shakeel, a Muslim man, was forcing Ashitha, who is Hindu, to convert to Islam by marrying her.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.
