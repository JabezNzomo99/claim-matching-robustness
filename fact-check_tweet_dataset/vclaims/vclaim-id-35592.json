No, that's not true: the United States has no \"Department of Home Affairs\" and the warning is simply a rehash from a real warning that was issued in South Africa but which is not based on any incidents taking place in the United States.\n\nAn example of the warning can be seen in this Facebook post (archived here) that showed a photo of a notice with following text:\n\nSeveral people in the United States shared the image in question under the impression it was about the U.S. Census since it mentions \"USA Residents\":\n\nThe United States does not have a \"Department of Home Affairs\". South Africa, however, does.\n\nThe South African Department of Home Affairs already issued a statement about similar warnings:\n\nAlso here, here and here.\n\nIn their statement on September 2 they even say they haven't actually received any reports of this kind of activity happening:\n\n02 September 2019\n\n \n\nThe Department of Home Affairs has noted messages on social media saying there are people pretending to be Home Affairs officials only to rob people once they have gained access to their homes. The message alleges that they are carrying letterheads purportedly from the department.\n\n \n\nHome Affairs has not received any complaint of this nature from members of the public. People who are aware of such an activity, depending on its veracity, are advised to report it to the police.\n\n \n\n\"We reiterate our message that Home Affairs officials do not and will not come to your homes to validate IDs\", said acting Home Affairs Director-General Thulani Mavuso.\n\nSo should U.S. residents be worried about a warning based on incidents that may or may not have happened in South Africa? Probably not.", "lang": "en"}
