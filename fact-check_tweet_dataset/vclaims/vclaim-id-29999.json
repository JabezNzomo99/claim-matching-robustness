The captions of the Facebook posts said the man was a \"suicide bomber.\"\n\nThe posts also said the photo was taken at the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT3) Taft Station in Pasay City earlier that morning.\n\nA reader sent a link to a Facebook post that carried this claim to Rappler's email for verification, but the post had been taken down as of writing.\n\nUsing social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, we found at least 3 other Facebook posts by different pages that contained the same claim. These pages are named 1996 Z, Pro Duterte, and Pasig Balita.\n\nThe facts: The Department of Transportation (DOTr) said the photo was taken during a \"penetration test\" conducted by the Philippine National Police on Tuesday, January 21, at the MRT3 Araneta Center-Cubao Station.\n\nIn a public advisory posted on Wednesday, the official DOTr-MRT3 page on Facebook said commuters have \"nothing to worry about.\" They explained that a penetration test is conducted to assess the alertness or security of an area.
