There are plenty of ways for teams to manipulate that figure, and several teams spend way below the salary cap.\n\nThe showing overall spending toward the salary cap for each team but not a detailed breakdown by offense vs. defense. To find that, we turned to , which provides a much more detailed position-by-position analysis. Their reporting is used by , the and others to report about NFL spending patterns. In the end, it\u2019s something of an estimate, but it\u2019s the best information publicly available and considered reliable.\n\nSo are NFL teams predominantly spending their money building offenses as Schlereth suggested?\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the big numbers and work backward.\n\nFor the 2013-14 year, the NFL\u2019s 32 teams spent a total of $1.7 billion on offensive players compared to $1.6 billion on defensive players. If you measured the money as a percentage, that would translate to 51.5 percent offense, 48.5 percent defense (the margin is actually closer once you consider that NFL teams spend money on a kicker and punter who are not part of either the offense or defense).\n\nFor perspective, that\u2019s closer than the popular vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.\n\nSpending by individual teams varies greatly. The Philadelphia Eagles spent nearly $74 million on offensive players, compared to $38.5 million on defensive players. The Cincinnati Bengals, conversely, spent $69 million on defensive players and $45 million on offensive personnel. (Both of those teams made the playoffs.)\n\nThe Seahawks and Broncos both spend more money on offense, by the way. But while the Broncos are considered the \"offensive\" team, the Seahawks actually spend a few extra million dollars on their offensive team.\n\nOverall, of the NFL\u2019s 32 teams, 11 spent more money on defense than offense, three teams spent just about the same amount on offense and defense and 18 spent more money on offense than defense. To put that in percentages, a little more than 56 percent of teams spend more on offense and about 44 percent do not.\n\nThat gives the offenses the edge, though not decisively so.\n\nOne last note: By saying \"now,\" Schlereth is suggesting that the move toward spending on offenses is a recent development. That\u2019s not necessarily correct. While salary cap data is harder to come by for previous years, we did find a list of all NFL players from 2008 and their salaries .\n\nIn 2008, offensive players made $1.7 billion (the same amount they made in 2013) while defensive players made about $1.52 billion. Part of the difference is simple numbers -- NFL teams paid 85 more offensive players in 2008 than they did defensive players.\n\nSchlereth said, \"The majority of teams (are) now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football.\" We reached out to Schlereth through his chili sauce company ( ) but did not hear back.\n\nThere\u2019s definitely evidence that NFL teams are spending more money on offensive players than defensive players. It's part of the reality of NFL football, where the most expensive players are typically quarterbacks.\n\nBut the disparity wasn\u2019t that significant in 2013, and it\u2019s actually less than it was in 2008.\n\nSchlereth's claim is accurate but needs clarification.
