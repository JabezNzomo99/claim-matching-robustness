The woman can be seen getting emotional a number of times in the video.\n\nThe caption of the 1-minute-39-second video says, \"The daughter of the biggest enemy of muslims, former president George Bush, daughter has excepted Islam religion masha Allah congregation sisters god blesse you\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be false. The six-year-old video is of a Romanian woman who had converted to Islam.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nReverse-searching one of the key frames of the viral clip, we found a longer version of the video on YouTube which was uploaded on January 18, 2014. The title of the video says, \"Romanian Woman Converting to Islam Emotional - January 2014\".\n\nThere are some close shots of the woman in the video, which do not match with the facial features of either Barbara Pierce Bush or Jenna Bush Hager, the twin daughters of George W Bush.\n\nHowever, we were not able to identify the woman in the video.\n\nFormer US President George W Bush is the father of twin daughters Barbara Pierce Bush and Jenna Bush Hager. Barbara is an activist and the founder of non-profit organisation Global Health Corps. Jenna is a journalist and anchor with NBC.\n\nIn February 2017, when US President Donald Trump signed an order temporarily suspending immigration from seven Muslim nations, Jenna had publicly expressed displeasure. She had then tweeted an excerpt from one of her father's speech, saying, \"This is not the America I know\"\n\nJust days after the 9/11 attacks, George W Bush had delivered a famous speech at the Islamic Center of Washington, DC, in which he praised the Muslim community and tried to assuage their fears. It was then that he used the phrase which Jenna tweeted.\n\nWe did not find any news reports saying that either of George W Bush's daughters converted to Islam. Had that been the case, it would have made news for days. Hence, it is clear that the woman in the viral video is not the daughter of the former US President.", "lang": "en"}
