The picture, features a picture of what looks like a woman in blackface and a man wearing overalls and a straw hat. \"The Clinton\u2019s (sic) at a costume party many years ago.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m very certain that Hillary would never want to let this picture go viral, there is young Bill, with Hillary in BLACKFACE,\" additional text beneath the photo says. \"Lets (sic) make this go VIRAL, shall we?\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new claim about Clinton, but we\u2019re here to debunk it.\n\nMark Burns, a pastor and Trump supporter, retweeted the image back in August 2016\u2014and then apologized for it.\n\n\"This is allegedly, it claimed to be of Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in blackface,\" CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota said in a 2016 interview with Burns. \"This is not true. This has been disproven and debunked time and again. This has surfaced in previous presidential races. So why share it?\"\n\n\"I didn\u2019t have the correct information,\" said Burns, who also retweeted a doctored photo of Clinton with blond braids.\n\nWe further couldn\u2019t find any credible, original source for this photo or corroborating evidence. And it doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. The eyes of the woman in the photo we viewed appear to be brown, not blue, like Hillary Clinton\u2019s. And while the man in the picture perhaps looks like former president Clinton, it\u2019s only a passing resemblance.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
