This is false; Canada\u2019s legislature has not passed any such law during the pandemic, and an expert said such legislation, federal or provincial, would easily be struck down as unconstitutional in the courts.\n\n\u201cFOR ALL THE CARING PARENTS OUT THERE WHOS KIDS MAYBE GOING BACK IN SEPTEMBER\u2026 YOUS NEED TO READ THIS,\u201d begin the posts from August 2020.\n\nThey describe a scenario in which a child who starts to show signs of illness at school is quarantined in a location that administrators refuse to disclose to the parent.\n\nThey end with the warning: \u201cI suggest every parent on my facebook gets off there arse and does some real research on the legislation of the covid act 2020 regarding the laws for children in school!!!! They are stripping your rights as a parent.\u201d\n\nThe same claim was shared on Facebook in here, here, here and here and on Twitter here.\n\nThe posts describe a \u201cCOVID act 2020,\u201d but no such law exists in Canada.\n\nIn March, the House of Commons amended several existing laws in order to respond to the pandemic, but Canada has not yet invoked extraordinary powers under the Emergencies Act, according to the law firm McCarthy Tetrault, which is tracking changes to federal and provincial regulations related to COVID-19.\n\nCanada\u2019s federal government is using the 2005 Quarantine Act as its legal authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases in the country that has now recorded just over 9,000 deaths from the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThere are no new pieces of legislation created by either the federal or provincial governments that would give the type of power described in the post,\u201d Amy Swiffen, Associate Professor at Concordia University, explained in an email.\n\nWhile provinces do have some emergency powers during the pandemic, \u201cthe government cannot separate parents from children in the way described,\u201d Swiffen said.\n\nThis was echoed by Emmett Macfarlane, Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo, who called the posts \u201cutterly false.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in existing legislation or any government proposal that would allow children to be moved or isolated without parental knowledge and/or consent,\u201d he said in an email.\n\n\u201cIf the government (at any level, federal or provincial) were to attempt to pass something allowing detention of children from their parents, it would be easily struck down by the courts as unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThe claim was spread by an August 11, 2020 post from an account in Britain.\n\nInitially, the post did not specify that the claim was specific to the UK. It was edited on August 13 to include the disclaimer, \u201cThis is for the UK,\u201d but not before it had received more than 72,000 shares.\n\nThe UK parliament did pass the Coronavirus Act 2020 in March 2020, granting emergency powers to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Schedule 21 of the Act gives public health officers, constables and immigration officers special powers related to \u201cpotentially infectious persons.\u201d\n\nHowever, it is false to claim that head teachers or school administrators would have the power to quarantine a child and false that parents or guardians would not be informed of any actions related to their children, according to Nicholas Clapham, teaching fellow at the University of Surrey.\n\nSchedule 21 specifies that, during any action against a child suspected of being infectious, he or she must be accompanied by a parent or appropriate adult.\n\nAt the time the Act was passed, and again in response to August 2020 social media posts, Children\u2019s Commissioner Anne Longfield asked the government to clarify the powers under Section 21.\n\nShe published the following response from the British government: \u201cIt is not true that Public Health Officers have the power to screen and assess without a parent or carer present. This power can only be exercised in the presence of an individual with responsibility for the child.\u201d\n\nClapham also pointed out in an email to AFP that, \u201cCurrent Government guidance is to self-isolate and seek a test where appropriate rather than to use police action in such cases.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check has also debunked the false claim that children needing treatment for COVID-19 would be taken to hospital without a parent.", "lang": "en"}
