No, it's special effects make-up\n\nMultiple online posts shared thousands of times contain a photo that they claim shows what a person would look like after being struck by lightning. The claim is false; the image actually shows special effects make-up.\n\nThe picture and claim were posted on Facebook here on April 27, 2018, by Historical Pictures, an account with more than four million followers.\n\nThe photo, which has been shared more than 13,000 times, shows a person\u2019s back layered with thin jagged streaks and what appear to be purple and yellow bruises.\n\nThe caption alongside the photo reads: \u201cIf you are lucky enough to survive a lightning strike, this is what your body will look like.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe picture has been posted repeatedly across multiple social media networks alongside similar captions that claim a lightning strike would leave such marks.\n\nOne post put up on March 8, 2019, can be found here on Facebook. Another can be found here on Twitter.\n\nThe photo and claim have also appeared in two Youtube videos \u2013 one published here on March 2017 with around 600,000 views and another here with nearly 10,000,000 views.\n\nA Google reverse image search traced the photo back to this original image posted on DeviantArt in 2004 by an artist named \u201cgorkafx\u201d or \u201cGorka\u201d from Spain. The photo is titled \u201cProthesic makeup 7\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of gorkafx\u2019s 2004 post on DeviantArt, with the caption \u201cBack bodypainting of a zombi\u201d:\n\nRecent comments below the photo on this page show that some people have already seen it used in relation to lightning strikes.\n\nThe artwork was created by a Spanish special-effects studio called Gorka Aguirre Studio. Some of the same artworks can be seen on both gorkafx\u2019s DeviantArt page and the studio's website here.\n\nBelow are two sets of comparisons between screenshots of creations taken from gorkafx\u2019s DeviantArt page (L) and Gorka Aguirre Studio\u2019s website (R):\n\nGorka Aguirre Studio told AFP by email in Spanish that the photo in the misleading post shows one of their artworks and often goes viral.\n\nThe email dated May 4, 2019, said: \u201cHi, we are a studio that does make-up effects for cinema\u2026\n\n\u201c... Someone stole (the photo) without permission and it is constantly going viral. I have warned a number of times that this is my work and asked them to stop, but it is out of my control.\n\n\u201cThe made-up actor is Ander Pardo, who has (also) demanded that they stop, but with no results and it is almost certain that it will appear again. I can\u2019t do anything about it.\n\n\u201cSorry, thank you for informing us, a number of you have already done so.\u201d\n\nBurns to the human body from lightning strikes do not clearly resemble the special effects make-up in the misleading image.\n\nAccording to this article in the Indian Journal of Dermatology, so-called \u201cLichtenburg figures\u201d are characteristic of lightning strike burns.\n\nBelow are two screenshots of burns depicted in the article, attributed to lightning. The burn on the left shows \u201cLichtenburg figures\u201d that resemble fern leaves.", "lang": "en"}
