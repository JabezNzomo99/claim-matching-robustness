Born in the village of Mavana on the island of Vanuabalavu, he studied commerce at the University of Auckland in New Zealand before embarking on a career in Fiji\u2019s civil service.\n\nMr Qarase served in the ministries of Finance, Commerce and Industry and Public Service. He also served as chairman of the country\u2019s first television company, Fiji Television and was a director of the Fiji Development Bank.\n\nMr Qarase won parliamentary elections in 2001 and 2006 before he was removed from power after a military coup in December 2006. He was jailed in 2012 for abusing his office and failing to perform his duties.\n\nOn April 21, the Fijian Broadcasting Corporation reported Mr Qarase had died and that the FBC was told by family members that he had been admitted to Suva\u2019s Oceania Hospital the previous week \u201cfollowing a short illness\u201d.\n\nAlso on April 21, Fiji-based TV network Mai TV reported that Mr Qarase\u2019s spokesperson confirmed the 79-year-old former prime minister\u2019s death. The report also said he passed away at Oceania Hospital in Suva \u201cfollowing a short illness\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook post claims Mr Qarase died from COVID-19 but the World Health Organization reports that, as of May 3, there have been no confirmed deaths from the coronavirus in Fiji. The report lists 18 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Fiji and that it has been 12 days since the last reported COVID-19 case for the Pacific nation.\n\nIn a statement on April 24, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said none of Fiji\u2019s confirmed cases of coronavirus were over the age of 65. Mr Qarase was 79 when he died.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be false. The post claims former Fijian prime minister Laisenia Qarase died from COVID-19, however World Health Organization data as of May 3, 2020, lists no confirmed coronavirus deaths in Fiji. Three days after 79-year-old Mr Qarase\u2019s death on April 21, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said there had been no confirmed COVID-19 cases in Fiji for anyone over the age of 65.
