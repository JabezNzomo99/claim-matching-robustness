No, that's not true and the call for volunteers in the satirical story the rumor originated from might actually endanger people. The \"news\" was published by a liberal satire website that aims to fool Trump supporters and conservatives into liking and sharing fake news so fans of the site can then mock them. In this case however there is a real danger somebody might get hurt, so please, if you see anyone sharing this story let them know it is fiction.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on September 12, 2018 titled \"UPDATE Patriot Volunteers Arrive To Guard Hurricane Areas From Looting Thugs\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear the word \"hurricane?\" To most, they hear \"danger -- get the hell out!\" Some even go to immediate concern for their neighbors and their fellow man. For those of who know better, we think \"I need to save my belongings.\" And the word hurricane brings with it, first and foremost, the threat of looters. The men who have shown up say they will take cover in their armored vehicles or in foxholes they've been digging for the past two days, ahead of where the most damage and highest risk of looters will occur. They are fully armed and willing to risk their lives for their fellow Americans.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so it is not inconceivable some people thought it was real:\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied by other sites that omit all the satire disclaimers and hints the story is fake, so if they saw it there instead of on the original site the chance of them believing it would be greater.\n\nThe article calls for volunteers to dig in at the beaches where the hurricane would strike:\n\nSuffice to say that is a really bad idea in hurricane-force winds and with incoming tides.\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes trumpbetrayed.us as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
