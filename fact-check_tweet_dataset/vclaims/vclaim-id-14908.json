It is being claimed that the Israel army shot this boy in Palestine.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found this claim to be false as the viral photo is a still from a film.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe viral image where a young boy wearing a checkered shirt can be seen sitting on knees with a bullet in his chest has been posted by a Facebook page \"I Love You ALLAH\" on Thursday (March 28). The caption attached to the viral photo says: \"A boy is shot dead in daylight by Israel army, no international media will show this, so be responsible & share this picture, so people get to know about the crisis of Muslims in Palestine.\" The post got more than 20000 shares on Facebook within 24 hours.\n\nFacebook user \"Jakaria Sarkar\" and \"Aisha Maria\" have also shared this photo.\n\nOn close look to the photo we observed that even with a bullet in his chest, there is no sign of fear or panic on the face of the boy. To know the truth, we reverse searched the image and found that this is not a real incident, but a scene from the film \"Mamlakat al-Naml (The Kingdom of Ants)\" that released in the year 2012. The boy in the same checkered shirt can be seen in the trailer of the film directed by Chawki Mejri. At 3 minutes 38 second of the trailer video, he can be seen shot and falling on his knees.\n\nEarlier also, this photo went viral with different claims. It was also claimed that the photo was taken during the first Intifada (1987-1993) where a Palestinian boy shot in the heart by Israeli occupation forces. However, all these claims are false. US-based fact-checking website snopes.com also debunked this image back in January 2017.\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: Viral post on Priyanka Gandhi discussing 2022 polls with workers is misleading\n\nAlso Watch | Fact Check: Bangladeshi woman's viral video is not of religious conversion but exorcism", "lang": "en"}
