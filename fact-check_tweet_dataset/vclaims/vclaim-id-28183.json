(Caption on the viral post - Have never seen dual personality like of PM Narendra Modi! How can one have respect for assassin Godse of Gandhi? #ModiExpelPragya is a remotest possibility! Who are we asking? The perpetrator of evil)\n\nA viral picture claiming Narendra Modi paid homage to Nathuram Godse, is fake. The photo shows Modi paying homage to the bust of Bharatiya Jana Sangh leader Deendayal Upadhyaya. The viral post has two images - one showing Modi paying homage to Mahatma Gandhi and the other where he is paying respects to Upadhyaya. The false claim draws a misleading comparison that on one hand Modi is paying respect to Mahatma Gandhi while on the other he also bows down to Godse, the \"man who assasinated him\". BOOM found that the photo is from 2017 when Modi paid tribute to Upadhyaya at the Bharatiya Janata Party headquarters in New Delhi on occassion of the 37th foundation day of the party. The image of Modi paying homage to the bust of Upadhyaya was previously viral in May 2019 which the same fake claim.", "lang": "en"}
