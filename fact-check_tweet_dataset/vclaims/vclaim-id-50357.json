The legislation passed overwhelmingly (363-40 on March 14) and provides billions of dollars so Americans can get free tests and, in some cases, receive two weeks of paid leave.\n\nAs debate about the bill began, we noticed claims going around that said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got \"caught\" trying to sneak abortion funding into the package.\n\nThis is false. There\u2019s no evidence that Pelosi was sneaking any funding toward abortion services in the bill.\n\nKnowing the facts has never been more important. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.\n\nA March 12 story by anti-abortion website \"Life News\" makes the claim. Its headline says: \"Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caught Trying to Include Abortion Funding in Bill to Combat Coronavirus.\" We saw many other examples of the same basic headline.\n\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIt cites a report by the Daily Caller, which also makes the claim and cites multiple unnamed \"senior White House officials.\" It says:\n\n\"Speaking to the Daily Caller, those officials alleged that while negotiating the stimulus with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Pelosi tried to lobby for \u2018several\u2019 provisions that stalled bipartisan commitment to the effort. One was a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which White House officials say would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.\"\n\nWhen we reached out to Pelosi\u2019s staff, they declined comment.\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, which was enacted in 1997, is a budgetary rider that prohibits the federal government from covering the costs of abortions except in very rare cases. The issue was that the bill\u2019s original draft didn\u2019t explicitly include Hyde Amendment language that would make sure that reimbursement of laboratory claims couldn\u2019t apply to abortion services.\n\nThe concern raised in the Daily Caller story was that the lack of language would create a loophole that abortion service providers could try to use in the future to get reimbursed with federal funds.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly more hypothetical than the matter-of-fact headline, \"Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caught Trying to Include Abortion Funding in Bill to Combat Coronavirus.\"\n\nHouse Democrats submitted a \"manager\u2019s amendment\" on March 12 that says reimbursement funds could only be used for COVID-19 related costs.\n\n\"Claims reimbursed under this section would be limited to those for uninsured individuals not eligible for other COVID-19 testing and services assistance included in the bill,\" a summary of the amendment says.\n\nA website claims Pelosi was \"caught trying to include abortion funding\" in the bill.\n\nThis is inaccurate. A section in the bill seeks to reimburse insurers for COVID-19 related laboratory claims. Concerns were raised that the bill\u2019s language could inadvertently open up federal funds for abortion services, but it\u2019s unclear exactly how. No draft of the legislation had funding for abortion in it.", "lang": "en"}
