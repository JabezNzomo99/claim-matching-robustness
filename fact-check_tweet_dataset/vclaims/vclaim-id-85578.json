It is not clear whether Comey used FBI computers for his other memos, though it is quite possible that he did. However, he also said that he made sure that one particular memo was unclassified \u2014 and this is the memo that Comey has acknowledged giving to a friend with the express purpose of it getting into the media.\n\nMoreover, the claim that Comey violated the Privacy Act, on its face, does not appear to make much sense. The Privacy Act of 1974 is mostly concerned about the collection and dissemination of information about people that is maintained in government files, such as personnel records or financial and medical information. The section of the FBI website quoted by Turley appears to refer to the FBI\u2019s Name Check program, in which the agency responds to requests from other federal agencies.\n\n\u201cI have had clients where these laws and regs were used during Comey\u2019s tenure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe enforcement is generally on an administrative level even though employees are repeatedly warned that they can be prosecuted. Comey was expressly tasked to investigate leakers under these laws and regulations and it fell to him to enforce the laws. Often violations are addressed through termination of employment or access to classified material. It can also result in court orders for searches or compelled disclosure.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Tunley, in a new column for The Hill, blasted this analysis as \u201ca prototypical example of the bias in reporting on these controversies.\u201d He said \u201cnone of this means that Comey should be charged criminally, but it is important that we recognize the underlying violations that he committed in this controversy,\u201d which he believed The Fact Checker failed to do. He listed what he described as four false premises in this column, and readers are invited to judge for themselves.", "lang": "en"}
