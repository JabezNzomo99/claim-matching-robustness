But it wasn\u2019t, and the structure itself was never in flames.\n\nFear-mongering extremist and conspiracy web sites seized upon photos and video of the event, however, misleadingly presenting them as \u201cevidence\u201d that the entire country was under coordinated attack. The Paris Police were quick to douse this speculation via social media. \u201cDon\u2019t spread false rumors,\u201d read a boldface tweet from the Pr\u00e9fecture de police. \u201cNo fire at the #TourEiffel. An accidental truck fire took place at Jena Bridge. It has been put out.\u201d\n\nNo injuries were reported in the Paris fireworks explosion.", "lang": "en"}
