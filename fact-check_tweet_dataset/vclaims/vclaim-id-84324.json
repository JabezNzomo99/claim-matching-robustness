The claim is false; the image has been edited from an original photograph of Indonesian policewoman Vani Simbolon with the face of K-pop star Kang Seul-gi superimposed on top.\n\nThese June 14, 2019 Facebook posts here and here contain an image of a woman wearing an Indonesian police uniform.\n\nThe Indonesian-language caption translates as: \u201cDispatched policewomen come from the Soeta every night, claiming to be tourists but they become policewomen. Allah has revealed the Indonesian police\u2019s deceits.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:\n\nThe same uniform can be seen here worn by other policewomen in photos published on the official Facebook account of the Indonesian police's public relations unit.\n\nSoeta refers to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Indonesia\u2019s largest airport located in the province of Banten, near the country\u2019s capital, Jakarta.\n\nReverse image searches on Yandex traced the photo back to a photo showing an Indonesian policewoman named Vani Simbolon.\n\nThe original image was posted here on her Instagram account on April 15, 2019. It is embedded below:\n\nThe photo was taken two days before Indonesian elections on April 17, 2019.\n\nThe Indonesian-language caption translates as: \u201cPreparations for a patrol to secure conditions for the 2019 elections.\u201d\n\nHere is an AFP report on Indonesia\u2019s April elections.\n\nIn the misleading Facebook posts, the original photo of policewoman Vani Simbolon has been reversed and edited. Below is a comparison of the original image (L), the mirror version of the original image (C) and the misleading image (R):\n\nIn the edited photo, the face of Kang Seul-gi, a member of K-pop group Red Velvet, who is better known as Seulgi, has been superimposed on top of Vani\u2019s face.\n\nHere is the original photo of Seulgi, posted to Instagram on January 6, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post from the account @seulgiredvelvet:\n\nBelow is a comparison between Seulgi\u2019s original image (L), the mirror version of it (C) and the image in the misleading Facebook posts (R):\n\nThe edited photo has circulated online since May 2019 and appears to be originally treated as a joke.\n\nFor example, the same photo was shared in this May 28, 2019, post to a Facebook page called Red Velvet Indonesia.\n\nTranslated to English, the caption reads: \u201cAdmin, seulgi has become a policewoman\u201d. The post is embedded below:\n\nA Red Velvet fan account on Twitter told its followers in this tweet on May 28, 2019, to stop sharing the edited image after it was used out of context to claim that policewomen have been \u201csent\u201d from abroad.\n\nAFP spoke to a Twitter and Instagram user named Ririn, who said she had edited the image to share with K-pop fans before Eid holidays starting on June 5, 2019.\n\nThe bio on Ririn's Instagram account says: \u201cManipulation Fanstagram, Just for Red Velvet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI edited it on April 22, 2019,\u201d she told AFP on June 17, 2019. \u201cI uploaded as an Eid content. My caption at that time was to check their vehicles before they headed home for the holidays.\u201d\n\nRirin also sent AFP her edited photo, which she said was \u201cpure from my picsart folder\u201d.\n\nIn her edited version, the picture is not reversed and it has a watermark that says \u201citsmekr1\u201d.\n\nIn the misleading Facebook posts, the image is reversed and the watermark has been removed.\n\nHere is a side-by-side comparison of Ririn\u2019s edited image and the edited photo shared in misleading Facebook posts:\n\nRirin also said, \u201cSince my photo was misinterpreted, I have deleted all my edits that I uploaded, including the policewoman picture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
