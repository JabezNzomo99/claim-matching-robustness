The viral pictures are from an incident of anti-Hindu violence in Pakistan and not Bengal\u2019s Telinipara.\n\nThe post has been widely shared on Facebook with the misleading claim.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we could trace the source of the viral pictures.\n\nThese pictures of violence have been circulating recently on several chat groups related to Hindu minorities in Pakistan. Some claimed the incident took place in Balochistan, while others say it is from Punjab in Pakistan.\n\nA Twitter account called Voice of Pakistan Minority posted graphic images of a man and woman with injuries and in torn clothes. The caption says: \u201cOnce again attack on #Hindu community, Gulab and his wife were attacked by neighborhood goons in Rahimyar khan, Punjab. His wife was sexually assaulted in front of Public. Shame on you people who are torturing minorities in #Pakistan.\u201d\n\nTwo of these pictures were used in the viral post.\n\nThis incident was also reported by the Gulf News on May 12 with the headline, \u201cPakistan: Hindu couple in rural Punjab brutally attacked, reason unclear\u201d.\n\nA few websites such as JK Now and instant have also reported the incident with the same viral images. These reports claimed that \u201c21 houses with children inside were burned\u201d in Pakistan recently.\n\nWe found that in a reply to a tweet by author and lawyer \u201cRahat Austin\u201d, Punjab Police of Pakistan tweeted, saying this incident at Rahim Yar Khan in Punjab was a land ownership dispute between Hindu and Muslim families and not a hate crime.\n\nAccording to reports, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has recently said that both Hindu and Christian communities in Sindh and Punjab continue to face forced conversions and violence in Pakistan.\n\nHence, it is confirmed that the viral pictures of violence are not from Telinipara in West Bengal\u2019s Hooghly district but from an incident of anti-Hindu violence in Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
