In the government's best estimate, the value of benefits was calculated at \u00a3330 million\u2014that's from freeing up resources that would otherwise be used to generate electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, costs were put at \u00a3170 million. This is the cost of buying additional emissions allowances under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme due to higher carbon emissions.\n\nAfter accounting for this cost, the net benefit to the UK economy is \u00a3160 million. This figure isn't totally comprehensive\u2014it doesn't include changes to air pollution, for example\u2014but is the government's best available estimate.\n\nThis assumes that cancelled onshore wind capacity is replaced by Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) generators, which are relatively cheap and quick to build.\n\nIf you change that assumption it changes the value of the costs and benefits. The government looked at an alternative scenario, one where it based the estimated cost of replacing the onshore wind capacity on something called the \"long run variable cost of electricity\". This is the 'total' cost of providing an extra unit of electricity to consumers; the wholesale price, the cost of subsidies to generators, and the cost of transmitting that electricity to users.\n\nThis includes generation by renewables, nuclear, and fossil fuels, and in turn means that the cost of generation is higher than if that electricity was generated by CCGTs. This would lead to generation being more costly than if it was done by onshore wind.\n\nUnder this option, carbon emissions rise more they do in the CCGT scenario, which means that firms have to purchase more EU emissions allowances.\n\nAdd the two effects together and what was a benefit of \u00a3160 million becomes an overall cost of \u00a3100 million.\n\nThe government doesn't think this is the most likely outcome; it thinks that generation from CCGTs is the most likely to make up the shortfall.\n\nMore on the net present value\u2014what do the \u00a3160 million and \u00a3100 million figures mean?\n\nProjects often span multiple time periods, presenting costs and benefits at different points during their lifetimes. For instance, a bridge requires money to be spent on its construction before it starts bringing benefits in the form of easier river crossings.\n\nIf we want to work out whether or not a project is worth it, we need to adjust for these differences in timing. Because people prefer to receive money sooner rather than later (generally people would rather be given \u00a3100 today than \u00a3100 in 3 months time), costs and benefits that occur sooner are 'weighted' more heavily than those that occur later.\n\nIf building a bridge across the Thames costs \u00a31 million today, but brings \u00a31 million worth of benefits next year, and the year after that, then it could be worth building it if we don't discount the future too heavily.\n\nThe \"minus \u00a3100 million\" estimate here is a net present value\u2014the present value of costs, minus the present value of benefits. So that estimated \"minus \u00a3100 million\" doesn't mean the country would be worse off today by that amount, or that it'd be worse off by that amount in the future. It means that the stream of costs and benefits is equivalent to losing a sum of that amount today.", "lang": "en"}
