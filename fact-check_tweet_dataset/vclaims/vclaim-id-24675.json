Velasco posted a Facebook status on Friday, May 10, claiming that Liberal Party (LP) poll watchers will not get copies of election returns (ERs) from the Commission on Elections (Comelec).\n\nThe facts: According to Article VII Section 28 of Comelec Resolution No. 10057, the Board of Election Inspectors shall provide copies of ERs to 10 accredited major national parties, allowing the LP to receive copies of these documents.\n\nThis is apart from the ERs allocated to the dominant majority and minority parties determined by the Comelec. On Wednesday, May 8, the Comelec named PDP-Laban as the dominant majority party, and Nacionalista Party as the dominant minority party.\n\nAlso, it was confirmed through a tweet by former Comelec commissioner Gregorio Larrazabal that \"major political parties, including LP, get one of the 22 copies.\"\n\nHowever, it is true that there will be \"no Namfrel count\" after the group rejected the Comelec's accreditation to be the citizen arm for the 2019 polls.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal, Namfrel secretary general Eric Alvia said in a press conference last May 3 that they \"will withdraw from the random manual audit.\"\n\nThe Comelec also provides ER copies to accredited citizens' groups \"for the conduct of citizens' quick counts at the local or national level.\" \u2013 Rappler.com\n\nThis fact check was written by the University of the Philippines Journalism Department.
