The facts on media ownership in Germany and the experience of prominent journalists and media owners prove the claim is false", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "November 21, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-13322", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-german-media-usa/29613499.html", "vclaim": "Russian Senator Igor Morozov\u2019s comments regarding the \u201cU.S. control over leading German media outlets\u201d come as part of a report claiming that Germany has \u201clost its sovereignty\u201d to the United States.\n\nThe piece was published by the \u201cFederal News Agency\u201d \u2013 an outlet that is reportedly part of the Internet Research Agency or the troll factory, owned by Concord Management and Consulting LLC. The firm is owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, also known as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef,\u201d who is indicted by the U.S. Justice Department for conspiracy to defraud the U.S. for interference in the presidential election in 2016.\n\nAlthough Senator Morozov made his claim with no evidence, it is quite possible to verify that his assertions are wrong. We looked at whether the German media is under the control of \u201cU.S. owners\u201d and that the U.S. sets the conditions for the selection of chief editors of \u201cleading media.\u201d\n\nGerman law does not limit or prohibit foreign ownership of the media.\n\nHowever, foreign ownership is a minor factor in the German media market.\n\nAccording to the Bilanz, a German language business magazine published in Zurich, Switzerland, the top major media owners in Germany are:\n\n\u201cThere are no American players in the German media market because simply there are no Americans,\u201d Manfred Quiring, a media expert and author of series of books on Russia told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cThese claims of the Russian Senator Igor Morozov, an ex-KGB/FSB officer are completely rubbish and absurd,\u201d Quiring said, pointing out, \u201ceven the Kremlin\u2019s own media debunk Senator Morozov\u2019s claim in a recent report by Sputnik in German language complaining that three family clans in Germany control the information.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Pressreference.com, \u201cThe only newspapers that can claim to be national in reach are Bild, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung, Die Welt, Frankfurter Rundschau and Tageszeitung.\u201d\n\nTwo of these, Die Bild and Die Welt, are owned by the German company Alex Springer Group \u2013 the largest digital publishing house in Europe that apart from numerous German language publications owns the English language outlet Politico, based in Brussels, and the news web portal Business Insider.\n\n\u201cI have never heard of this policy. It is definitely not practiced at Axel Springer. We are invested in the U.S. media market (e.g. BUSINESS INSIDER) but we do not have a major U.S. stakeholder, although of course, being a publicly listed company, we have U.S. shareholders,\u201d Edda Fels, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications at the Axel Springer SE told Polygraph.info via email responding to the Russian senator\u2019s statement.\n\nAnother press outlet in the Pressreference.com list is Die Tageszeitung \u2013 a cooperative-owned daily newspaper administrated by its employees.\n\n\u201cThe German media is independent from the U.S. As about the chief editors \u2013 that claim is laughable,\u201d Klaus-Helge Donath, the chief of the Moscow bureau of Die Tageszeitung told Polygraph.info.\n\nSonja Volkmann-Schluck, Press Officer at the German Press Council said, \u201cThe statement of Mr Morozov is wrong. There is absolutely no precondition for editors in chief to complete any internship in American media outlets.\u201d\n\nSo our verdict relies on fact, not assertion, in finding the senator\u2019s claim is false.", "lang": "en"}
