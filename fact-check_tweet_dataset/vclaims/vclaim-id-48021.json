The claim is false; one of the photos shows storm clouds in the US state of Delaware, and the others show Typhoon Trami, which hit Japan in September 2018.\n\nOne photo was published in a Facebook post here on October 11, 2019, one day before Typhoon Hagibis made landfall in Japan.\n\nThe typhoon left at least 58 people dead, AFP reported on October 15.\n\nThe misleading post has been shared more than 3,200 times. It shows storm clouds over a beachside boulevard.\n\nIts caption states: \u201cIn Okinawa Japan the typhoon Hagibis captured by the locals. Stay safe everyone\u201d.\n\nOkinawa is Japan\u2019s southernmost prefecture and \u201ca region very susceptible to typhoons\u201d, according to the Okinawa Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the first misleading post:\n\nThe photo has also been shared tens of thousands of times here on Facebook and here on Twitter on October 12 with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false. A reverse image search on Google found the same photo was published in this Washington Post report on August 26, 2019.\n\nThe report's headline states: \u201c\u2018Spectacular\u2019 and \u2018insane\u2019: Creepy shelf cloud looms over popular Delaware beach\u201d.\n\nThe photo, captioned \u201cAn extremely ominous shelf cloud approaches Rehoboth Beach, Del., on Aug. 19,\u201d was credited to Don Burdick, who was interviewed by the Post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo published by the Washington Post:\n\nThe report states in part: \u201cMost people flock to Rehoboth Beach, Del., in the summertime for a merry atmosphere and tranquil skies. Don Burdick\u2019s photo from Rehoboth Beach looks like something from another planet.\n\n\u201cThe picture, snapped last Monday, is eerie. It shows an unusually well-pronounced \u2018shelf cloud\u2019 portending an imminent storm -- one that brought 75 mph winds just offshore. Half-dollar-size hail was reported just north of Indian River Bay. You can see the hail core on the left in Burdick\u2019s photo.\"\n\nThe image was taken here on Rehoboth Avenue, Delaware. The location on Google Street View is embedded below.\n\nThe US National Weather Service warned of storms in the northeastern part of the country, including parts of Delaware, on August 19, 2019.\n\nAn analysis using Wolfram Alpha, an online tool which archives weather data, shows it was partly cloudy with scattered showers in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on August 19, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the findings on Wolfram Alpha:\n\nThe second misleading post was published on Facebook here on October 10, 2019. It has been shared more than 1,000 times. It comprises four images that appear to show views of a storm from space.\n\nIts caption, with the parts in Tagalog translated to English, states: \u201cTYPHOON HAGIBIS | Satellite Image of the strongest typhoon that will hit Japan anytime from now. Let us all pray for the safety of the overseas Filipino workers and for the entire Japan\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post with the photos numbered by AFP:\n\nSome of the photos in the second Facebook post have been shared thousands of times here and here on Twitter in posts about Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nThe photos have been shared in a misleading context; they were captured from space during Typhoon Trami in 2018.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found all four photos published on Twitter by European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Alexander Gerst on September 26, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading post (L) and Gerst\u2019s tweet (R) with corresponding photos numbered by AFP:\n\nGerst\u2019s tweet states: \u201cAs if somebody pulled the planet's gigantic plug. Staring down the eye of yet another fierce storm. Category 5 Super Typhoon Trami is unstoppable and heading for Japan and Taiwan. Be safe down there! #TyphoonTrami\u201d.\n\nTyphoon Trami injured dozens of people and disrupted travel in Japan after making landfall in Japan on September 30, AFP reported here on October 1, 2018.\n\nPhotos in both of the misleading posts have also been shared tens of thousands of times here and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim that they show Typhoon Hagibis.", "lang": "en"}
