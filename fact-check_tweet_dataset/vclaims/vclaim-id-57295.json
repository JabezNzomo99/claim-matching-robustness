(link to the archived tweet)\n\nMany other users continued to share the video on Facebook and Twitter with this caption. This video is being shared with these claims on WhatsApp too.\n\nAfter doing a keyword search, we found this video had been uploaded on December 4, 2019, which means that it cannot be in connection with his upcoming film, \u2018Sadak 2\u2019.\n\nTimes Group\u2019s entertainment channel ETimes had uploaded a YouTube video of Shaheen Bhatt\u2019s book launch. Shaheen is the elder daughter of Mahesh Bhatt. This 51-minute video contains clips from the viral video, which can be seen at the 46:24 mark. Shaheen Bhatt recently released a book about her experience of living with depression.\n\nAt the 43:19 mark of the video, Shaheen Bhatt got a question from an audience member. The individual asked if Bhatt could come up with any specific things that people in her life could, cannot, or should have done to help her cope with her depression. She responded by saying that there was no answer to this question because every person is different and experiences depression differently every day. Speaking of her own experience, she added that on some days, talking to other people helped her cope. And on other days, it would be difficult for her to talk to people or answer questions about how she was doing. At the same time, she emphasized the importance of having a supportive person to listen to her without judgement and getting too affected. Mahesh Bhatt also weighed in here, discussing how the ability to listen was a very significant quality in people. He added that it was very important to have someone hear you cry. It is very important that someone listened to you as you cried. At 46:23, there was a follow-up question where an audience member asked, \u201cSo you don\u2019t really want answers?\u201d Responding to this, the director flared up, exclaiming that there were no answers in reality. He went into a passionate rant of sorts, stressing that people who claimed to have the answers were \u201cpretenders\u201d.\n\nThis video from December 2019 is being recently shared with false claims that the director\u2019s enraged reaction was in response to the 1 crore YouTube dislikes for the trailer of his upcoming film \u2018Sadak 2\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
