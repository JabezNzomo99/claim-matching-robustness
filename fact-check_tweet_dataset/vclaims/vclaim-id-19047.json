Public Relations Officer of DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, confirmed the released in brief statement in Abuja, last night.\n\nMeanwhile, during our factcheck process, it was gathered that although the Public Relations Officer of DSS, Dr. Peter Afunaya addressed the pressmen on El-Zakzaky\u2019s release in Abuja on Monday August 5, 2019, there was at no point where he mentioned that the man has been released.\n\nReported by Premium Times, Punch, Thenation, Nigerian Tribune and other leading newspapers in the country, Dr. Peter Afunnaya was quoted to have said:\n\n\u201cThis is to inform the public that the Department of State Services has received the order granting Ibrahim El-Zakzaky leave to travel to India for medical treatment. Consequently, the Service is liaising with relevant stakeholders to ensure compliance.\n\n\u201cConformity with the order is in line with the service\u2019s avowed commitment to the rule of law inherent in a democracy.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Monday August 5, 2019, it was reported that a Kaduna State High Court granted El-Zakzaky and wife, Zeenat, permission to travel to an Indian hospital for medical treatment.\n\nThe Shiites leader and wife were, however, absent when Justice Darius Khobo gave the ruling.\n\nThey were granted leave to travel to India for medical treatment following injuries they sustained during the IMN\u2019s clash with the Nigerian Army on December 15, 2015.\n\nCelebrating the court ruling, the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, otherwise known as Shiites, on Monday expressed their happiness on the judgement.\n\nIn a press release made available to journalists, the chairman of Free Zakzaky Campaign Committee, Abdurrahman Yola said:\n\n\u201cToday, Monday 05/08/19 we obtained a favourable judgement in the ruling on application specifically seeking for the court\u2019s permission to allow Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky and his wife, Malama Zeenat Ibrahim to seek urgent medical treatment outside this country.\n\n\u201cThis ruling is not only a vindication that leaving all doors open to obtain favourable outcomes works, but it is a victory for our dogged determination, patience and perseverance in the face of extreme persecution. It is a victory for truth and justice against tyranny and impunity\u201d\n\nHowever, at the moment, El-ZakZaky has not been released and the Shiites say they are unaware of such development.\n\nThis fact-check was done by a Dubawa Fact-checking Fellow in collaboration with The Tribune Online, the online publication of the oldest surviving newsroom in Nigeria.
