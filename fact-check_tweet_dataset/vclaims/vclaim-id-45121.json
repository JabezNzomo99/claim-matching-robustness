The Embassy of Madagascar told the Daily Caller News Foundation the country remains a member state.\n\nThe viral post appears to reference the WHO\u2019s pushback on Rajoelina\u2019s claims regarding Covid Organics, the herbal tonic Rajoelina launched in April. In a May 7 press briefing, WHO Africa Director Dr. Matshidiso Moeti said, \u201cWe would caution and advise countries against adoption of a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy,\u201d according to France 24. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Madagascar Found A \u2018Coronavirus Medicine\u2019 That Can \u2018Wipe Out The Virus\u2019 In 6 Days)\n\nRajoelina has touted the tonic as a preventative and cure for COVID-19, despite no scientific evidence to show its efficacy, according to The Associated Press. Following the WHO\u2019s caution against the use of Covid Organics, Rajoelina told France 24, \u201cWhat if this remedy had been discovered by a European country, instead of Madagascar? Would people doubt it so much? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Rajoelina has attempted to withdraw Madagascar from the WHO, nor that he encouraged other African countries to do so. The DCNF found no credible news reporting about such a call to action from Rajoelina. Searching his Twitter account and his office\u2019s website also didn\u2019t turn up any announcement to that effect. The island nation remains listed as one of the 194 member states on the WHO\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cThe presidency of Madagascar formally denies all these allegations,\u201d Lova Ranoramoro, a spokeswoman for the president, told AFP Fact Check. \u201cSince the launch of the Covid-Organics remedy, many words have been falsely attributed to President Andry Rajoelina. We firmly condemn these false quotes.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Embassy of Madagascar in the United States confirmed to the DCNF in an email that Madagascar \u201cis a full member of the World Health Organization and remains so.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
