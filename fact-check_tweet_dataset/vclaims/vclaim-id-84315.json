It's a cropped, mirrored image\n\nAn \"incredibly beautiful\" image of a mass protest in Hong Kong has been shared tens of thousands of times in social media posts that claim it shows an anti-extradition bill march in the city on June 16, 2019. The night-time picture is actually a cropped, mirrored version of an original photograph of a similar protest a week earlier, on June 9, 2019.\n\nThe image, which appears to show a Hong Kong street filled with people, was shared in this Twitter post on June 17, 2019.\n\nThe post's caption says: \u201cReport: 2.13 million ppl rallied in #HK. Incredibly beautiful!\u201d\n\nOrganisers say around 2 million people attended a protest in Hong Kong on June 16, 2019, against a proposed law to allow extradition to China. Here is an AFP report about the rally.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Twitter post:\n\nThe same image was also shared on June 16, 2019, by Demosisto politician Nathan Law on his Twitter account here, where it has been retweeted more than 3,200 times with the caption: \n\n \u201cOfficial: organizer says 2 millions of people marching today. #NoChinaExtradition\u201d.\n\nThe image was also shared on Instagram here in a post that says: \u201cHong Kong\u2019s biggest protest march ever on 16th June 2019\u201d.\n\nThe edited image does not show the Hong Kong protest on June 16, 2019; it shows a similar anti-extradition bill rally in the city on June 9, 2019.\n\nHere is an AFP report about the June 9 demonstration, which organisers said more than a million people attended.\n\nThis Instagram post by @lsb.co, dated June 11, 2019 contains the same edited image.\n\nIts caption says: \u201cwhatever it takes. #AntiELAB #noextraditiontochina (photo is cropped and reflected).\u201d\n\nCropping and reflecting are photo editing techniques which can flip and mirror an image.\n\nThe resulting image is vertically symmetrical, with even the smallest details the same on both the left and right hand sides, as shown below:\n\n@lsb.co also shared the original, non-edited photo on Instagram here on June 10, 2019.\n\nThe June 10, 2019, Instagram post has a caption that says:\n\n \u201cYou cant just ignore our 1.3mil peaceful protestors. HongKongers, rise to defend this beautiful place we call home, this is our very last and only chance tmr.\u201d\n\nDeacon Lui, whose Instagram handle is @lsb.co, confirmed to AFP over Instagram messenger that the manipulated picture is an edited version of the above photo that he took on June 9, 2019, during the first big protest.\n\nBelow is a side-by-side comparison of the edited image (L) and the original photo (R):\n\nLui told AFP on June 17, 2019, that he took the original photo from a building \u201copposite Hysan Mall and beside Sogo\u201d department store building, looking at Hennessy Road.\n\nThis Google Street View of Hennessy Road in Hong Kong shows the same features seen in the original photograph, including the pedestrian street bridge and the elevated road.\n\nBelow is a side-by-side comparison of the original photo (L) and the Google Street View image (R), with the matching features circled:\n\nCORRECTION: This post was updated on June 20, 2019, to correct the spelling of a name to \"Lui\" from \"Liu\" in the third-to-last paragraph.", "lang": "en"}
