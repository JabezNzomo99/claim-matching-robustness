This is false; the image shows an American student who posted online about being sexually assaulted in Spain.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make the real George Floyed famous,\u201d one Facebook user wrote in a June 11, 2020 post featuring a photo of a young woman whose face is covered in bruises and blood.\n\nThe post claims that the woman\u2019s name is Aracely Henriquez, and that she was attacked by Floyd and five accomplices who were looking for drugs and money in her home.\n\nThe photo and parts of her testimony were subsequently reported in English in the online version of El Pais, a national newspaper in Spain.\n\nAccording to Texas court records, Floyd was charged with nine different offences between 1997 and 2007, including possession of narcotics and theft.\n\nAccording to a court document, the charge stemmed from an August 9, 2007 incident in which he entered a woman\u2019s home, pointing a gun at her stomach and searching the home for drugs and money with accomplices.\n\nCourt documents identify the woman who was robbed as Aracely Henriquez, and say she was struck with a pistol by one of Floyd\u2019s accomplices, but do not give any indication that she was pregnant at the time, as the Facebook posts claim.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 30 examples of false or misleading information about Floyd and the protests that followed his death, available here.", "lang": "en"}
