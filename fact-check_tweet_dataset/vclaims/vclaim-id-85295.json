It was also posted on August 30, 2019.\n\nBail Pola was held on August 30 this year. It is a festival celebrated in rural parts of Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Maharashtra, among other states. Farmers pay respects to their bulls by decorating and worshipping the animal. A procession is also carried out in the village with the bulls. Alt News found other videos of the procession where policemen can be spotted. If one notices carefully, the bulls haven\u2019t been unleashed on the cops but they are making way for the animal.\n\nSeveral Pakistani social media users, therefore, shared the video with the false claim that villagers in India unleashed cows on policemen conducting a raid in the area.", "lang": "en"}
