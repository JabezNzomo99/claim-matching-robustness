The new article starts:\n\nThe main point of the new article reads:\n\nWe don't even need to try and debunk that since the \"22nd Circuit Court of Appeals\" does not actually exist as we have already pointed out in this earlier article debunking the earlier claim from the same site that a judge from that court had declared certain parts of sharia law valid in the United States. In that article the judge's name was reported as \"Mahal al Alallaha-Smith\" though and a different fake picture was used with the story. This time the picture of William Thomas was shown, a gay black judge that was nominated for a federal position under the Obama administration but whose nomination was withdrawn.\n\nBesides that there is also the disclaimer on the site's about page:\n\nWhen no one can trust the lying fake news liberal media anymore because they hate us and guns and Harley Davidson and meat and OUR president, As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes but not really.\n\nTo remove all doubt, the footer of the site even has a \"Satire Warning\" icon:\n\nSo to believe and share this news you either have to be exceptionally dumb or just too lazy to actually click through and read the article. But it looks like hundreds of people still did so anyway you can see in the Trendolizer graph at the end of this article. Don't fall for it and warn others who might have been mislead into believing it.", "lang": "en"}
