The testimony came as the U.S. experienced a spike in reported COVID-19 cases.\n\nAlthough scientists believe that the novel coronavirus, the virus causing the COVID-19 disease pandemic, had animal origins before it infected humans, the Trump administration has promoted an unfounded conspiracy theory that the disease originated in a lab in Wuhan, China, where it was originally detected in the winter of 2019.\n\nU.S. Rep. Marc Veasey asked Fauci about the grant, stating it didn\u2019t make any sense to him that funding for research on the coronavirus had been canceled \u201cwhile we are in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic,\u201d asking Fauci if he knew why the decision had been made.\n\n\u201cWhy was it canceled? It was canceled because the NIH was told to cancel it,\u201d Fauci replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know the reason, but we were told to cancel it.\u201d\n\nThe exchange can be heard right after the 4:36 mark in this C-SPAN video.\n\nFauci later clarified to Politico that it was the White House specifically that directed NIH to cut off the funding.\n\nFunding for the research project, which was run by the U.S. non-profit EcoHealth Alliance, was pulled on April 24. The move raised suspicion that it was done for political reasons, as the science and technology outlet Ars Technica reported:\n\nThe move was criticized by scientists, who called it counterproductive in the fight against the pandemic.\n\nBecause Fauci stated in public testimony that NIH was told to cancel a grant for coronavirus research and later clarified to Politico that it was the White House that had initiated cutting a research grant for the EcoHealth Alliance research, we rate this claim \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
