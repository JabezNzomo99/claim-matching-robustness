Malviya seems to be offended by these nine pictures that led him to make insinuations linking Hardik Patel\u2019s alleged sex CD to Nehru\u2019s DNA. Let us take a closer look at these pictures to understand their context.\n\nThis is not the first time that these pictures of Nehru with women have found their way to social media. These published pictures that have been in public space for years are often used by BJP supporters to portray Nehru as a womanizer.\n\nThe woman giving Nehru a peck on his cheek in full public view is none other than his sister Vijaylakshmi Pandit. In 1949, Pandit was India\u2019s ambassador to the United States. In the picture, she is seen as welcoming her brother on his state visit to the US.\n\nThis is a picture of Nehru sharing a lighter moment with Edwina Mountbatten in public.\n\nHere is Nehru\u2019s sister Vijaylakshmi Pandit once again. The picture is of the time when she was the Ambassador to Russia and is being received by her brother at Delhi Airport.\n\nNehru is seen as smoking here. We are unclear what prompted Malviya to link his smoking with Hardik Patel\u2019s DNA.\n\nThis is a picture of Nehru congratulating Mrinalini Sarabhai after the Manushya performance in Delhi in 1948. As outlined in an article by Mint, \u201cMrinalini Sarabhai had a double connection with Jawaharlal Nehru\u2014her mother Ammu Swaminadhan was a freedom fighter and a politician who knew Nehru well; her husband Vikram Sarabhai\u2019s family too had a close association with him\u201d. Sarabhai told Mint, \u201cIn those days, Kathakali was not approved of and not many people appreciated it, especially in Delhi. But Jawaharji came for the performance and afterwards he came to see me. He hugged me and congratulated me. There is a photograph of us together.\u201d Little did she know that 70 years later, some perverted minds will circulate this picture to malign her and Nehru.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy visited India in 1962. In this picture, Nehru is applying a ceremonial \u201ctilak\u201d to American First lady Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nSo we know from picture 4 that Nehru smoked. Here he is lighting a cigarette for Mrs Simon, the wife of the British Deputy High Commissioner, onboard the first BOAC flight in India.\n\nNehru is seen in this picture with Edwina Mountbatten\u2019s 18-year-old daughter. Mountbatten\u2019s youngest daughter Pamela Mountbatten is with her parents, bidding goodbye to Pandit Nehru in New Delhi.\n\nIn this picture, Nehru is being given a kiss by his niece Nayantara Sehgal on his arrival at London airport in 1955. You can also see Sehgal\u2019s mother, Vijaylakshmi Pandit who was the High Commissioner to UK at that time.\n\nTo sum up the collage, three pictures where women are seen as showing affection towards Pandit Nehru by hugging or kissing him are pictures of his sister and niece. They point to nothing more than a natural and close family bond. Amit Malviya, the Head of the IT wing on India\u2019s ruling party, placed these images out of context to portray Nehru in a negative light.", "lang": "en"}
