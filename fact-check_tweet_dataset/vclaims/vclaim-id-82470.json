Is this the BJP\u2019s message- Take a bullet for a question! Listen- translation).\n\nSurjewala asserted that Kalraj Mishra\u2019s words exposed the \u201cviolent mindset\u201d of the BJP, by threatening those raising slogans against the Faridabad MP.\n\nThe entire video of the gathering and Kalraj Mishra\u2019s speech has been posted by Mishra himself on his Facebook page. Listening to his speech makes it evident that he did not refer to shooting anyone. The video was streamed live on March 24.\n\nThe relevant part of the speech starts from the beginning of the speech till 01:13 minutes. Mishra in his speech had said, \u201cIf someone wants to create a nuisance here, i request them to get up and leave and create a ruckus elsewhere, not here. It is a lie to say that you are Modi\u2019s man and then act like a rogue at this gathering. Today, an environment in favour of Modi is being created in this country and you are ruining it. Are you not ashamed? You are nationalists. Think about the nation.\u201d\n\nHe then goes on to say, \u201cFighting elections is not the only parameter. I have felt bad. (Even) If this were my region/turf, i would have got off the stage and said the same thing.\u201d\n\nThis concluding part of the clip which was shared by Randeep Surjewala was misinterpreted, deliberately or otherwise, as a threat to shoot. From the video, it is evident that Mishra had said, \u201cagar hamara pradesh hota, toh main niche utarke wahi baat karta\u201d (If this were my region/turf, i would have got off the stage and said the same thing). Instead, Surjewala claimed Mishra had said, \u201cagar ye unka pradesh hota to iss tarah gadbad karne walo ko wo stage se utarkar goli mar dete\u201d (If this were his turf, he would have got off the stage and shot those creating nuisance).\n\nThis was clarified by Mishra himself via a tweet in which he hit back at Surjewala, calling it a petty act.", "lang": "en"}
