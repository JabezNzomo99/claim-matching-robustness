The credits at the end of the video clearly indicated that the video was a work of a satire and was not associated with Facebook:\n\nThe language used in the video is also suspicious at best. Although Zuckerberg is occasionally mocked for being socially awkward, we highly doubt that the CEO of the social media giant would refer to himself as \u201cthe Zuck Man\u201d in an official video announcing the end of an industry giant tech company.\n\nThis hoax video was created by taking genuine footage of Mark Zuckerberg and then digitally altering the movement of his mouth (and inserting the audio of a voice actor) to make it seem as if he were announcing the closure of Facebook. The original video was posted to Zuckerberg\u2019s official Facebook page in September 2017 and featured the CEO of Facebook talking about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election:", "lang": "en"}
