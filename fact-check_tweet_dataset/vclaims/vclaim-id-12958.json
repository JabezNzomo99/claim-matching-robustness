For instance, Austria had a rate of 2.9 per 1,000 live births; Belgium, 3.3; Czech Republic, 2.8; Denmark, 2.9; France, 3.5; Germany, 3.1; Iceland, 1.6; Sweden, 2.4; and the UK, 3.5.\n\nIGME graph option makes it possible to compare data for different countries, and the screenshot below illustrates just how much higher the infant mortality rate in Russia is than in European countries.\n\nThe World Bank estimated Russia's infant mortality rate for 2015 at 8 per 1,000, while a majority of EU countries ranged between 2.4 and 4 per 1,000.", "lang": "en"}
