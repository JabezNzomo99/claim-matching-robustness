The City University of London hosted the summit, which was supported by Poynter, Duke Reporters\u2019 Lab, National Endowment for Democracy, Omidyar Network, Google News Lab, Ford Foundation and The Conversation.\n\nIn 2014, the first meeting of fact checkers from around the world took place in London\u2013 including, among many others, The Fact Checker, Chequeado (\u201cFact-Checked\u201d) in Argentina, La Pagella Politica in Italy, ABC Fact Check in Australia, AfricaCheck in South Africa, and Ukraine\u2019s StopFake. At that meeting, the groups decided to form an International Fact Checkers Association. (Glenn Kessler, editor of The Fact Checker, documented the boom in global fact checking in an article for Foreign Affairs magazine.)\n\nTen-minute \u201clightning presentations\u201d from fact-checkers featured a variety of formats and efforts. \u201cEl Objetivo de Ana Pastor,\u201d a Spanish TV news show, draws a large audience through its Sunday evening fact-checking segment. Host Ana Pastor and economics reporter Natalia Hernandez discuss inaccurate statements from the week\u2019s political coverage, give them \u201cfalso,\u201d \u201chablar por hablar\u201d (\u201ctalk to talk\u201d) or \u201ca mi manera\u201d (\u201cin my way,\u201d or cherry picking) ratings and engaging the audience with sleek graphics and visualization.\n\nMexico\u2019s Animal Politico features El Sabueso, or The Bloodhound dressed as Sherlock Holmes, for its rating system. Dulce Ramos, from Animal Politico, showed how El Sabueso \u2014 who growls and barks in tweets \u2014 interacts with readers on social media. Not all fact-checking organizations use ratings, and whether to use ratings remains a point of debate among fact checkers.\n\nSome fact-checking operations are managed by nongovernmental organizations, like the Finnish Faktabaari. It is run by a transparency NGO called Avoin yhteiskunta ry (Open Society Association), which comprises journalists and European Union experts, and works with journalism students to help with fact checking. \u201cFaktabaari\u201d means \u201cfact bar\u201d in Finnish, and the intent was to \u201cserve\u201d facts on common misperceptions in EU election campaign debates in 2014. For issues that are not readily fact-checkable, the organization set up Debattibaari, or Debate Bar, for fact-based discussions.\n\nFact-checkers around the world have similar goals, but not all of our approaches are the same. Lucas Graves, University of Wisconsin-Madison assistant professor who studies fact-checking, presented results of his qualitative study of articles by six fact checking Web sites: PolitiFact, El Sabueso, UYCheck (Uruguay), Full Fact (UK), AfricaCheck, FactChecker.in (India). He coded different characteristics to see how fact-checkers differ in methods. For example, readers of The Fact Checker know that our standard is to contact the speaker of the quote to give them a fair chance to respond. In some countries with limited access, it may not be possible to ask the speaker. We have a published methodology, but some fact-checkers don\u2019t do so due to legal limitations in their country. Graves\u2019 research sparked a debate on whether fact-checking needs international standards.\n\nEver wonder who pulls all the clips from years ago, of a politician saying exactly the opposite of what they\u2019re saying today, to skewer the politician with his or her own words? It\u2019s Chodikoff, who reads voraciously and has a knack for remembering obscure references in floor speeches or TV interviews from years ago. \u201cWithout credibility, jokes have no meaning,\u201d Chodikoff said, and his job is to give Jon Stewart \u201cfactual firepower.\u201d Not surprisingly, Chodikoff is a big fan of fact-checkers.\n\nPolitiFact\u2019s Obameter, which tracks the president\u2019s record on keeping campaign promises, has led to a \u201cfamily tree\u201d of promise trackers. Inspired by Obameter, Egyptian fact-checkers created the Morsi Meter to hold the Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi accountable. Morsi Meter inspired the Rouhani Meter to track campaign promises of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Rouhani Meter then inspired SadRoz, which monitors the Afghan government.\n\nSo what\u2019s next for this global community of truth sleuthers? Thanks to a $225,000 grant from Omidyar Network and $75,000 in funding from the National Endowment for Democracy, the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla., will become the home of international fact checking organizations. The new center will foster the growing network through training and resources, and launch a Web site to highlight global fact checking efforts.", "lang": "en"}
