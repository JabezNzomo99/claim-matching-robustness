While there has been a change in the timing of reporting of official statistics regarding the impact of COVID-19, there is no suggestion that family consent has any role in the registration of deaths or their statistical reporting. In Northern Ireland, the Public Health Agency has stated that all deaths are a matter of public record.\n\nOn the Newsnight programme (26 March 2020; from 1:20) the political editor, Nick Watt, made this statement while discussing the numbers of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the UK:\n\n\u201cIt turns out that these figures may not actually be the deaths that have taken place over the last 24 hours because the Department of Health, the NHS, needs to have the consent of the families of people who have died to release their figures. So some of the deaths may have taken place a few days ago, so it is not exactly a like-for-like figure every day.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England present daily updates on the number of COVID-19 cases, as well as deaths which are publicly available.\n\nEarlier in his report, Watt refers to a change in how the daily statistics are released. This was directly addressed in a series of tweets published by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). They clarified the following regarding the daily release of data regarding COVID-19:\n\u2022 The latest figures counted from the previous day (for a period from 5pm-5pm) will be published at 2pm the following day.\n\u2022 Yesterday\u2019s figures [referred to by Watt on Newsnight] did not cover a full 24 hour period while we adjust to the new system. These figures comprised the period from 9am 24 March to 5pm on 24 March.\n\u2022 Going forwards, figures on deaths will be recorded for the 24 hour period as of 5pm the previous day.\n\nTherefore, in effect, the 24th of March was a \u2018crossover day\u2019 between 2pm reporting and later reporting, meaning the figures appear lower than normal. As a result, the next day\u2019s number total appears higher. Therefore, any perceived anomaly is about timing.\n\nRegarding the need for family consent, there is no direct reference to COVID-19 changing the process in which a death is registered. According to the Office of National Statistics (ONS), mortality statistics are based on information recorded when deaths are certified and registered. Most deaths are certified by a medical practitioner, using the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD).\n\nThis certificate is taken to a registrar by an informant, which is usually a near relative of the deceased. Also, deaths should be registered within five days of death. Thus there may be fluctuation in the compilation of daily deaths, but this is not due to seeking any consent.\n\nIs this the case in Northern Ireland?\n\nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) in Northern Ireland also provides a daily surveillance bulletin.\n\nFactCheckNI contacted the Public Health Agency (PHA) for comment on whether or not the family of individuals who have died as a result of COVID-19 have to give permission for them to be included (or not) in the official statistics. PHA responded:\n\n\u201cDeath statistics are a matter of public record. Permission is not required for statistics to be compiled and published on deaths with an associated diagnosis of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nWhile public health authorities do not require permission to compile and publish statistics on death, journalists\u2019 reporting of individual deaths is a matter addressed by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), the independent regulator of a majority of the UK\u2019s newspapers and magazines. IPSO\u2019s Editor\u2019s Code of Practice provides guidance on the reporting on a death. This includes not breaking the news of a death to the immediate family, and not to publish information that might cause any unnecessary upset to friends and family of the person who has died.\n\nA Newsnight programme stated that the delay in reporting the number of deaths due to COVID-19 was due to a requirement of consent by families of the deceased.\n\nInstead, the Department of Health explains that the delay was due to a change in the timing of compiling and publishing of data.\n\nThe Public Health Authority in Northern Ireland confirms that no permission is required to compile and publish this data.\n\nThe reporting by journalists of details about individual deaths is a matter addressed by the independent regulator, IPSO.\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
