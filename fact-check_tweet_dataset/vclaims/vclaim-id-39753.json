The accompanying message reads, \u201cMR. Morarji Desai..former Prime Minister of India played garba at Bhadeli-Valsad in year 1962.\u201d\n\nThe above post is of October 2018, and has been shared over 8400 times so far. The 3:05 minute video clip was circulated at around this time last year, coinciding with Navratri, as is the case now. Several individual users have posted the video on Facebook with identical text.\n\nThe video has also been shared on Twitter and YouTube.\n\nThe same has been circulating with Gujarati text as well. The text reads, \u201c\u0ab8\u0acd\u0ab5.\u0ab5\u0aa1\u0abe\u0aaa\u0acd\u0ab0\u0aa7\u0abe\u0aa8 \u0aae\u0acb\u0ab0\u0abe\u0ab0\u0a9c\u0ac0 \u0aa6\u0ac7\u0ab8\u0abe\u0a88 \u0aaa\u0acb\u0aa4\u0abe\u0aa8\u0abe \u0ab5\u0aa4\u0aa8\u0aae\u0abe\u0a82 \u0aa8\u0ab5\u0ab0\u0abe\u0aa4\u0acd\u0ab0\u0ac0\u0aa8\u0abe \u0a97\u0ab0\u0aac\u0abe\u0aae\u0abe\u0a82 \u0ab0\u0abe\u0ab8 \u0ab0\u0aae\u0aa4\u0abe\u0a82 \u0aa8\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0ac7 \u0aaa\u0aa1\u0ac7 \u0a9b\u0ac7\u201d (\u201cFormer PM Morarji Desai playing garba at his native place\u201d). A Facebook post with this text was viewed over 63000 times and shared over 1200 times, before it was deleted.\n\nIn October 2018, Zee 24 Kalak had posted a link to this video on Twitter with the same narrative.\n\nThe claim is false. Alt News searched Google with the key words \u2018Morarji Desai dandiya\u2019, and found a report by the Gujarati daily Divya Bhaskar. The report is of October 2018, and states that the person in the video is NOT former PM Morarji Desai.\n\nThe report is titled, \u2018Viral video: Garba player not Morarji Desai but Kunwarji Narsinh Lodaya\u2018 (translated). It states, \u201cThis video was viral a few days back. It is said that India\u2019s first Gujarati PM Morarji Desai is playing garba. The truth is something else. The person wearing the cap and playing garba is not Morarji Desai but Kunwarji Narsinh Lodaya who is playing garba with his brother Mulji Narsinh Lodaya. Kunwarji Lodaya is no more. This video is said to have been taken at a wedding ceremony in Mumbai in 1994.\u201d (translated).\n\nThe portal DeshGujarat also states that the person wearing the cap and performing the garba is indeed Kunwarji Lodaya, and that the video was taken at a personal wedding ceremony in Mumbai in 1994. DeshGujarat had contacted the late PM\u2019s family to confirm that the person in the video is not Morarji Desai. The report states, \u201cDeshGujarat contacted Morarji Desai\u2019s great grandson Madhukeshwar Desai, who after watching this video confirmed this is not Morarji Desai. Apart from other things, he observed that Morarjibhai would always wear Chudidar. And it\u2019s not just about dress. Height, body structure, complexion everything is different than how Morarji Desai looked.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, a video showing a dandiya performance by an elderly gentleman wearing a Gandhi cap has been falsely shared as footage of former PM Morarji Desai doing garba.", "lang": "en"}
