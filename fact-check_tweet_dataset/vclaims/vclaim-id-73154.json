The claim is false; the video has circulated online since 2017.\n\nThe video has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here, which has been viewed around 68,000 times since it was uploaded on February 27, 2019.\n\nThe footage shows rounds of tracer bullets being fired as flares fall from above in the dark.\n\nIn the clip, a group of people appear in the foreground filming the bright barrage of bullets on their phones and a voice can be heard saying in English: \"...can do what a man can do\".\n\nThe caption on the post, published by a Facebook page called \"Pak Army\", says: \"Current situation of Sialkot LOC\".\n\nLOC stands for the Line of Control, the de facto border between Pakistan and India in the disputed Kashmir valley. Sialkot is in Pakistan's Punjab province, near the border.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same video with similar captions also appears elsewhere on Facebook, for example here.\n\nPakistan and India have recently exchanged fire near the Line of Control. Here is an AFP story on the incident.\n\nBut the video in the misleading Facebook posts does not show the current situation at the India-Pakistan border.\n\nA reverse image search using key frames from the video, obtained through digital verification tool InVid, found that the footage has been circulating online since 2017.\n\nThe video was published in July 2017 on YouTube here, with the caption: \u201c(Pakistan Army) Thousands of Tracers\u2026 Random Infantry Fire Power Show\u201d.\n\nIt was also published in July 2017 on Facebook here and elsewhere on YouTube here and here, with the caption: \"Pakistan Army Shows Fire Power\".\n\nBelow is side-by-side comparison of video screengrabs from the misleading Facebook post (L) and the July 2017 YouTube video (R):", "lang": "en"}
