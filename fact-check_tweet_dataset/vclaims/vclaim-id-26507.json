It also included the logos of Kabataan, Anakbayan, and League of Filipino Students.\n\nThe facts: The quotation included in the photos that circulated on social media did not come from Sarah Elago. It is similar to the first paragraph of Kahlil Gibran\u2019s poem \u201cOn Children\u201d from his book The Prophet, which reads:\n\n\"Your children are not your children.\n\nThey are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.\n\nThey come through you but not from you,\n\nAnd though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\"\n\nOn August 9, Kabataan party-list denied the claim through its official Twitter account. Elago tweeted on her official account later that day to call for the takedown of the posts that wrongly quoted her.\n\nRappler reached out to Santos to ask for the source of his post, but he hasn\u2019t replied to our inquiries. We also couldn\u2019t find the quoted lines in any of Elago\u2019s recent interviews and statements from news reports.\n\nOn August 7, the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs held a hearing to investigate leftist groups\u2019 alleged recruitment of minors in universities. Elago did not attend the meeting because of prior commitments and the short notice, which Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) deputy chief of staff for civil-military operations Major Gen Antonio Parlade Jr called a \u201csloppy excuse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
