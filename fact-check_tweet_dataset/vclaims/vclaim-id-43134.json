But this claim is completely false and no \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans were raised in the state. The message being shared with the video is deliberately misleading. The short clip shows a political leader walking down a railway platform surrounded by some other people, as others raise slogans of \u2018Abu Azmi Zindabad\u2019 and \u2018Mumbai Police Zindabad\u2019 etc. An archived version of this post can be seen here. The video, uploaded by a Facebook handle called \u0938\u0941\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0928 News Channelfans, had 42k views and 3.6k shares at the time this story was published. The message being shared with the video claims that \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans were raised in Mumbai and that this took place in front of Maharashtra\u2019s Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi. Police Notice to Ex-MLA in Bulandshahr Shared With False Context\n\nThe video was viral on Facebook and Twitter with this claim. An archived version of this page can be seen here. An archived version of this page can be seen here. We were also able to find the clip on Facebook with a similar claim in English, which added the location of the clip as Wadala station. An archived version of this page can be seen here. We were able to confirm that the political leader seen in the video is indeed Abu Asim Azmi, the president of the Maharashtra state branch of the Samajwadi Party. Further, on checking his Twitter page, we found that Azmi himself had called out the claim as fake, reporting tweets by people who had said that \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans were raised in front of him. In a video tweeted out by him on Sunday, 17 May, Azmi acknowledges the rumours doing the rounds and says that nobody would be able to raise \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans in front of him and get away with it and that he himself would set them right for such an act. He further adds that this trend of spreading hatred through such claims has been been prevalent in the country since 2014. According to him, the video had been shot at Mumbai\u2019s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminal, where he, along with many party workers, had gone to see off migrant workers boarding a train to Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Quint then found the original and slightly longer version of the video, uploaded on social media and video sharing platform TikTok by a user by the name jabirkhan406. In this video, it can be clearly heard that the slogan actually being chanted is \u2018Sajid bhai\u2019 and not \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019. Now, based on the information that Azmi had gone to the station with multiple Samajwadi Party workers, we ran a search for a Sajid in the party and found that Sajid Siddiqui is the district president for South Central Mumbai. Sajid Ahmed Siddiqui has been appointed as the New District President today for South Central Mumbai District..... Posted by Abu Asim Azmi on Thursday, January 3, 2019 Therefore, it is clear that no Pakistan Zindabad slogans were raised and that a slogan of \u2018Sajid bhai Zindabad\u2019 is being used to spread this claim.
