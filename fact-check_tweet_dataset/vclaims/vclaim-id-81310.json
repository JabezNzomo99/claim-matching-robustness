Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) earns 4 Pinocchios for making an assertion that lacks any basis in fact.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2015-03-05T17:42:11Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-81310", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/03/05/lawmaker-claims-illegal-immigrants-released-by-obama-are-committing-a-murder-a-day/", "vclaim": "There are on average 44 murders a day in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Assuming murders by illegal immigrants were prorated as a percentage of the U.S. population, it is not unreasonable to assume one to two murders a day are committed by illegal immigrants.\n\nBut that\u2019s just a straight-line calculation \u2014 and Sessions was not talking about the 11 million or so illegal immigrants, but about the 130,000, including 30,000 with previous criminal records, that the Obama administration released in the 2014 fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30.\n\nSince there are no nationwide data kept on murders committed by illegal immigrants, let alone on immigrants who are released by the Obama administration, Sessions\u2019s staff struggled to come up with something that would confirm his assertion.\n\n\u201cThousands of illegal immigrants have been convicted of crimes, and President Obama has allowed them to stay in the United States of America, and the president\u2019s unwise, unlawful and unconstitutional executive actions on immigration will only cause an increase in risk to our public safety,\u201d said a Sessions spokesman who declined to be identified.\n\nNote that the statement actually tries to subtly change the meaning of Sessions\u2019s remarks \u2014 that Obama is allowing immigrants who have been convicted of crimes to stay in the United States, not that people released by the Obama administration have committed crimes.\n\nThe spokesman also passed along a pie chart produced by the Texas Department of Public Safety purporting to show that aliens were accused of committing 3,000 homicides in 2014. (In U.S. law, \u201calien\u201d means any person in the country who is not a U.S. citizen or national.) But it turned out this was data over a six-year period \u2014 2008 to 2014 \u2014 and the Department of Public Safety at the time did not know which of these people arrested were in the country illegally; it only knew they were not U.S. citizens. In fact, the chart was so old that it no longer appears on the agency\u2019s Web site.\n\nInstead, the agency has overhauled the crime data to track immigration status dating from June 2011. \u201cWe reprogrammed our own criminal records system to identify the DHS immigration status code on all the available historical responses and all hits responses going forward,\u201d said spokesman Tom Vinger. This resulted in a dramatic reduction in the numbers, because of a short time frame and confirmed immigration status.\n\nThus, over a 43-month period, 795 aliens were accused of homicide, and 336 were convicted. Of the charges, Vinger said 561 (71 percent) are attributed to foreign nationals illegally in the country and 234 (29 percent) are attributed to legally present foreign nationals. A breakdown of actual convictions was not immediately available, but assuming the same percentage, that would mean 239 illegal aliens were convicted of murder over a 43-month period. (Note: These numbers are for arrests and convictions, not the number of people.)\n\nThat works out to about one murder every five days, not every day, from every illegal immigrant, not just those released by the administration \u2014 and Texas has a much larger share of the illegal immigrant population than most states. Even if you wanted to do a simple straight-line calculation based on the fact that Texas is about 8.4 percent of the U.S. population, that adds up to about two murders a day. But as we noted above, that\u2019s just about what one would expect given the size of the illegal population and average murder rates in the United States.\n\nRemember that Sessions was talking about murders committed by people released by the administration, which is a much smaller universe. Indeed, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in January released a report tracking crimes committed by 36,000 illegal immigrants who had criminal records and were released in 2013. One thousand of these one-time criminals had added to their criminal record, including such charges as assault with a deadly weapon, terrorist threats, failure to register as a sex offender, and spousal rape. But murder or homicide was not even on the list.", "lang": "en"}
