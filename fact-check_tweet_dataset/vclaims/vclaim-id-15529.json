In her tweet, Jain claimed that the Congress party had used the same elderly woman for all their photoshoots. \u201cCongress pays her 5000 Rs. per photoshoot,\u201d read her tweet.\n\nFrom a Facebook page India Against Urban Naxals, the screenshot of Jain\u2019s tweet received over 9,600 shares, in contrast with 1,300 retweets of Jain\u2019s original tweet.\n\nAnother page Resurging Hinduism also shared a screenshot of Jain\u2019s tweet, drawing over 1,000 likes.\n\nScreenshots of the tweet are floating on Instagram as well. This was pointed out by a Twitter user.\n\nOne of the photographs with a BJP leader\n\nWhile Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Shashi Tharoor and are easily recognisable, the fourth leader is not even a member of the Congress party. He is the general secretary of BJP Kerala, K Surendran. The image was a part of BJP\u2019s campaign in Pathanamthitta, as per numerous tweets.\n\nAlt News had debunked this misinformation in the past when it was shared sans Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s image, which has been lifted from her recent visit to Kerala.\n\nNot the same woman\n\nAll four women might seem alike because of their old age and white hair. A closer look, however, reveals apparent distinctions in physical features. Alt News has juxtaposed photographs of the four women for a clearer view. The second woman was photographed with BJP\u2019s K Surendran and the fourth, with Shashi Tharoor. The third elderly woman is the same who could be seen embracing Rahul Gandhi. We have chosen a different photograph of hers from the images tweeted by Congress for ease of distinction.\n\nThe third woman is visibly different from the rest.\n\nThe other three women also have distinct physical features. For instance, the one in the middle has more black hair than the other two, and the first woman\u2019s hair seems more voluminous. Another clear difference is the teeth. While the front teeth of the elderly woman in the middle seem blackened, the third one has visibly protruding front teeth. The shape of the nose is distinct as well.\n\nAll the four women are, thus, not the same. Moreover, one of them was photographed with BJP Kerala leader K Surendran. The resurfacing of this misinformation suggests a relentless attempt to push the false narrative.", "lang": "en"}
