The basis for these claims is a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a peer-reviewed medical journal, on Wednesday. The study examined 5,700 patients who had been hospitalized due to coronavirus in New York City between March 1 and April 4. It analyzes a number of factors\u2014age, sex, underlying health issues\u2014to explore how patients in different groups fared with coronavirus. But the finding that led to a flurry of articles and tweets was that \u201cMortality for those requiring mechanical ventilation was 88.1%.\u201d\n\nHowever, this statistic doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Of the 5,700 patients included in the study, 3,066 cases were not yet resolved. As the doctors behind the paper wrote: \u201cThe absence of data on patients who remained hospitalized at the final study date may have biased the findings, including the high mortality rate of patients who received mechanical ventilation older than age 65 years.\u201d While reporting on the study often included this caveat, the headlines and tweets did not.\n\nThe authors also cautioned that \u201cthis study reported mortality rates only for patients with definite outcomes (discharge or death), and longer-term study may find different mortality rates as different segments of the population are infected.\u201d\n\nOne of the paper\u2019s authors, Dr. Mangala Narasimhan, told The Dispatch Fact Check that across the hospital system the ventilator mortality rate is currently in the high 60 percent range. \u201cIt will continue to drop a little,\u201d said Dr. Narasimhan. \u201cI think it will be in the 50-60 percent mark.\u201d\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
