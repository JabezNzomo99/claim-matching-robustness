Christians are too moral for business.\u201d\n\nBehind the quote appears the cover of Trump\u2019s 1987 book \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of Trump saying this statement, in \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d or anywhere else.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidential campaign was buoyed not only by his reputation as a dealmaker and businessman, but also his support among Evangelical voters. Had Trump made such a statement, it would have likely alienated a voting bloc important to his 2016 election victory.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence of this being a legitimate quote from Trump. Though his every word is closely followed by the press, The Daily Caller did not find any news reports containing the statement.\n\nThe words \u201catheism\u201d and \u201cChristian\u201d do not appear anywhere in \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d and the Caller found nothing in the book that reflected a similar sentiment.\n\nThe man who wrote the book with Trump, ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, has been openly critical of the president and expressed regret for his role in penning the best-selling book that helped Trump further his fame.", "lang": "en"}
