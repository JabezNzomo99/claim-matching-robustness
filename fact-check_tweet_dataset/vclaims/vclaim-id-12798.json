Even though women accept Rs 200 notes and keep them in their blouses and the men drink alcohol, Congress loses in your district \u2013 translated.\u201d The video and the accompanying text suggested that the Congress MLA was talking about his party bribing voters before polls. At the time of writing this article, the video drew 20,000 views.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News found that the 1:18-minute video uploaded by Nakhua was clipped to omit the context of his statements. A Facebook user Sujeet Patel uploaded a longer version of Patwari\u2019s statements which reveals that he was, in fact, not talking about Congress\u2019 election strategy but that of the BJP. While appealing for votes, Patwari termed the BJP \u201canti-poor\u201d and said that the party does little for the marginalised, yet manages to secure votes by bribing them with cash and alcohol. During elections, he alleged, that women accept Rs 200-500 as bribes and keep them in their \u201cblouses\u201d while the men take alcohol.\n\nIn the 2:54-minute video, Patwari can be heard saying, \u201c\u090f\u0915\u094d\u091a\u0941\u0905\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u0947 \u092c\u0940\u091c\u0947\u092a\u0940 \u0917\u0930\u0940\u092c\u094b \u0915\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0930\u094b\u0927 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u2026\u0924\u0941\u092e \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0938\u092e\u091d\u0924\u0947 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u094b | \u091a\u0941\u0928\u093e\u0935 \u0906\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u092c \u096b\u0966\u0966-\u0968\u0966\u0966 \u0930\u0941\u092a\u092f\u0947 \u0932\u0947\u0915\u0947 \u092a\u094b\u0932\u0915\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0916 \u0932\u0947\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e\u090f\u0901 | (Actually BJP is an anti-poor party..but you people don\u2019t understand.

And now when this tactic is not proving to be effective, see how they are threatening voters \u2013 translated.\u201d\n\nSeveral users followed by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office also shared the video affixing the same claim. Among them was one Geetika Swami whose tweet drew over 21,000 views.\n\nWhile the nature of Jitu Patwari\u2019s statements roused controversies, there is no contention on its meaning. The Congress MP wasn\u2019t describing his party\u2019s election tactics but claiming that the BJP secures votes by bribing the marginalised before the polls and this has led to the Congress losing elections. With MP elections around the corner, circulation of misleading posts is bound to surge. Earlier, a photograph of a Congress leader was misused and linked to a prostitution racket. A photoshopped image of MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan consuming meat was also viral on social media.", "lang": "en"}
