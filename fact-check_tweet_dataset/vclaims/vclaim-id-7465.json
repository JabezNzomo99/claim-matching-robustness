{"title": "Zakharova: Handbook for Journalists Covering World Cup is \u2018More Russophobia\u2019", "subtitle": "Zakharova criticized a handbook for journalists covering the World Cup in Russia next month. Produced by human rights groups, the handbook chronicles abuses of rights and freedoms committed by the Russian state, both during preparations for the 2018 World Cup and more broadly. It also recommends what foreign reporters should cover beyond sports.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 24, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-7465", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fifa-2018-russia-soccer-fact-check/29247909.html", "vclaim": "The Russian Foreign Ministry said the handbook for journalists covering this year\u2019s World Cup, which will be held next month in Russia, is \u201cnothing but more Russophobia\u201d and a \u201ccollection of trivial anti-Russian stereotypes.\u201d\n\nThe handbook was produced by the Norwegian Helsinki Commission, together with other global rights watchdog groups, including Amnesty International and the Human Rights Foundation.\n\nThe Norwegian Helsinki Commission is part of the human rights monitoring network within the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\nWhat Zakharova calls a \u201ccollection of trivial anti-Russian stereotypes\u201d is actually a collection of facts documenting abuses of rights and freedoms committed by the Russian state -- both during preparations for the 2018 World Cup and more broadly -- as well as racist behavior by Russian soccer fans.\n\nThe 22-page handbook serves as a comprehensive database of documented abuses, including those that happened in the 11 Russian cities where the 64 World Cup soccer matches will be held. It also gives contact information for local rights activists.\n\nIn addition, the handbook includes essays by independent Russian journalists and rights activists recommending topics beyond sports that their foreign colleagues covering the World Cup should look into while in Russia.", "lang": "en"}
