Leicester City Council told Full Fact that while they are knocking on doors to offer or make residents aware of local testing while the city is in local lockdown, this is not forced and having a test is entirely optional, as it currently is across the UK.\n\nLeicestershire Police also confirmed to Full Fact that they had had no reports of anyone trying to force entry into a home under the guise of testing or using violence to administer a test. They added that no police officer in Leicester has forced a member of the public to be tested.", "lang": "en"}
