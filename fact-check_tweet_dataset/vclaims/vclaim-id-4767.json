Muslims Did Not Move SC Against \u2018Mata ki Chowki\u2019", "author": "www.thequint.com", "date": "2018-07-08T22:06:05+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-4767", "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/fake-news-muslims-file-sc-petition-against-hindu-ritual", "vclaim": "On July 7, several claims on social media alleged that members of the Muslim community filed a petition in the Supreme Court against holding \u2018Mata ki Chowki\u2019, a Hindu ritual, in public spaces. Among those who tweeted this misinformation was lawyer Prashant Patel Umrao who followed it with a question \u2013 \u201cShould Hindus allow Namaz and Muharram on roads?\u201d Umrao deleted his tweet the next day. Alt News has archived its cached version that can be accessed here. In less than 24 hours when the tweet was live, more than 1,000 people \u2018liked\u2019 it and over 700 retweeted it. A quick read through the comments section shows that a few hours are enough to spread hate. The word quickly spread on both Facebook and Twitter, with many sharing Patel\u2019s tweet.\n\nHowever, the petition was neither filed by \u2018Muslims\u2019 nor was it against the ritual. It was in fact in favour of the ritual and was filed by an organisation, Jyoti Jagran Manch, that was denied permission by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to hold \u2018Mata ki Chowki\u2019 and \u2018jagran\u2019 (overnight prayer meeting) at a park in South-West Delhi. While the petition referred only to the aforementioned Hindu rituals, the SC\u2019s hearing would pertain to the larger question of whether any religious function should be permitted at public spaces. Do Muslims Commit 95% of Rapes in India? Nope, That\u2019s Fake News\n\nAdvocate Fuzail Ayyubi, arguing in favour of allowing the ritual to be held in public spaces tweeted at 12:20 am on 6 July about the case. He wrote, \u201cHon Supreme Court today referred my matter Jyoti Jagran Mandal to CJI for placing it before the Constitution Bench\u2026\u201d As Ayyubi bears a Muslim name, some social media users assumed that he was the one opposing the petition and began to target him.\n\nAyyubi replied to one of the users, saying that he is in favour of \u2018Mata ki Chowki\u2019 and the user subsequently deleted the tweet. Several others came out in defence of Ayyubi, clarifying that he is, in fact, the counsel for the petitioner Jyoti Jagran Mandal. A recognisable pattern can be observed in the manner in which members of minority communities are targeted on social media \u2013 a false narrative is created and is widely and repeatedly circulated until the lie becomes truth and the discourse is completely diluted. Such claims are so common on social media that lawyer Fuzail Ayyubi was targeted without the need for a catalyst. People\u2019s biases were enough for them to believe that he couldn\u2019t possibly be \u201con their side\u201d. It is, thus, imperative that any information on social media is cross-checked and not blindly believed.", "lang": "en"}
