The baby was shot right in front of it\u2019s mother by two black teenage thugs. Two suspects have been arrested. They are ages 17 and 14. The mother was also shot in the leg. Brunswick, GA is about 60% black. The area where the murder took place is overwhelmingly black. The 2010 census shows the area to be 13% white and 73% black. The media absolutely refuses to call it a \u201chate crime.\u201d\n\nThe bare facts of the case were reasonably accurate as presented above. On March 22, 2013, news accounts reported the arrest of two teenagers in the shooting death of a 13-month-old baby in Georgia during a robbery attempt:\n\nBRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) \u2014 A pair of teenagers was arrested and accused of fatally shooting a 13-month-old baby in the face and wounding his mother during their morning stroll through a leafy, historic neighborhood in southeast Georgia. Sherry West had just been to the post office a few blocks from her apartment [the previous] morning and was pushing her son, Antonio, in his stroller as they walked past gnarled oak trees and blooming azaleas in the coastal city of Brunswick. West said a tall, skinny teenager, accompanied by a smaller boy, asked her for money. \u201cHe asked me for money and I said I didn\u2019t have it,\u201d she told The Associated Press from her apartment, which was scattered with her son\u2019s toys and movies. \u201cWhen you have a baby, you spend all your money on babies. They\u2019re expensive. And he kept asking and I just said \u2018I don\u2019t have it.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Do you want me to kill your baby?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, don\u2019t kill my baby!\u2019\u201d Authorities said one of the teens fired four shots, grazing West\u2019s ear and striking her in the leg, before he walked around to the stroller and shot the baby in the face. Seventeen-year-old De\u2019Marquis Elkins is charged as an adult with first-degree murder, along with a 14-year-old who was not identified because he is a juvenile, Police Chief Tobe Green said. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the boys had attorneys.\n\nThe older of the two teenagers was eventually convicted on felony murder charges. But nothing in the reporting on the case supported The Daily Archives\u2019 headline, which claimed that the suspects were \u201cracists\u201d who perpetrated a \u201chate crime\u201d by deliberately targeting white victims and shot a baby \u201cfor the fun of it.\u201d\n\nRather, according to police, the victim was selected randomly, and her child was shot because West \u201cdid not produce cash immediately when she was held up\u201d:\n\nGlynn County Police Chief Matt Doering told reporters before the indictment was returned that investigators believe the crime was random. \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable now, six days into it, to say the location of the incident and the victim were random,\u201d Doering said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any information that shows otherwise.\u201d The details contained in the indictment seem to back up the story the slain baby\u2019s mother, Sherry West, has repeated to numerous reporters: She was pushing her baby in a stroller as she walked home from the post office when two youths approached asking for money. West says when she refused, the older teen drew a gun and shot her in the leg before shooting her son in the head.\n\nTragically, this incident proved to be the second time West lost a child to violence:\n\nThe fatal shooting of a 13-month-old boy in his stroller marked the second time mother Sherry West lost a son to violence, she said. Her 18-year-old son was stabbed to death in 2008 in New Jersey, she told CNN. \u201cThis is the second child that people have taken from me in a tragic way,\u201d West said. \u201cI\u2019m so afraid to have any more babies now. I tried to raise really good kids in a wicked world.\u201d The day after two teenage boys were arrested and charged in the fatal shooting of her baby, West said she was planning to leave Brunswick and return to New Jersey. The boy\u2019s father has also been emotionally distraught, West said. Asked about the person who shot her son, Antonio, West stated: \u201cI hate you and I don\u2019t forgive you. \u201cYou killed an innocent human life,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope you die for it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
