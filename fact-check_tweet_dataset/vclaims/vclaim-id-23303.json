The claim is false; the image has been doctored from a photo which shows Trump holding an executive order.\n\nThe image is contained in this Facebook post, which was published on June 6, 2019, and has been shared more than 650 times.\n\nIt shows US President Donald Trump holding up a photo of Filipino politician Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr.\n\nHere is Bongbong\u2019s profile on the website of the Senate of the Philippines. He is the son of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who led the Philippines for two decades until he was toppled in a 1986 \u201cPeople Power\u201d revolution. Here is more information about the revolution on a Philippine government website.\n\nNext to Bongbong\u2019s photo is a white page with the words \u201cThe Next President\u201d and Trump\u2019s signature.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201c100 % MR. PRESIDENT TRUMP...THAT BBM WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINE\u2019S REPUBLIC\u201d.\n\nThe same image and caption were also shared elsewhere on Facebook, for example here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the image has been doctored from a photo which shows Trump holding an executive order.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the original photo published in this Forbes magazine article, dated January 24, 2017, about Trump withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe caption credited the photo to AFP. A keyword search of AFP\u2019s archives found this image taken on January 23, 2017.\n\nThe AFP photo caption states: \u201cUnited States President Donald Trump signs the Executive Order withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after signing it in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on Monday, January 23, 2017.\n\n\u201cThe other two Executive Orders concerned a US Government hiring freeze for all departments but the military and \u2018Mexico City\u2019 which bans federal funding of abortions overseas\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the AFP photo (R):\n\nBongbong ran for vice president in 2016 and lost, as reported here by AFP at the time. He protested the result, prompting a recount that is ongoing; here is a Philippine government information page about the recount, published January 22, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
