Mount Vernon, Washington\u2019s estate, has a web page dedicated to \u201cspurious quotations\u201d incorrectly attributed to the founding father.\n\nFor this alleged quote, the Mount Vernon library writes that it has \u201cyet to find an explanation for this misquote or a similar quote of Washington\u2019s that was confused for this statement.\u201d\n\nWe too were unable to find any credible source for this quote. It does not appear in \u201cThe Quotable George Washington: The Wisdom of an American Patriot,\u201d a biography published in 1999 that contains many of Washington\u2019s most famous phrases. Our search of the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington also turned up nothing.\n\nThe earliest version of this quote that we could find was shared on Facebook in an October 2011 post entitled \u201cOur Founding Fathers on the Second Amendment: The Right to Bear Arms.\u201d That list, however, was not accompanied by any credible source information.\n\nFurthermore, the first quote on that list begins with a phrase legitimately attributed to Washington (\u201cA free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined\u201d), but ends with a clause fabricated to alter its original meaning and intent.\n\nIn short, this appears to be a modern quote incorrectly attributed to Washington long after his passing in 1799.", "lang": "en"}
