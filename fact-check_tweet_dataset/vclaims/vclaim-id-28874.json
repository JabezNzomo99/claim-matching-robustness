[1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Kelly\u2019s claim that only a third of CO2 emissions come from electricity generation.\n\nThis year's federal poll was labelled the \u2018climate change election\u2019 following dissatisfaction among voters on a perceived lack of action on the issue from successive governments. The ALP took a suite of climate policies to the election, including an emissions reduction target of 45 per cent by 2030 in a bid to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The coalition pledged a more modest target of 26 per cent by 2030. [2] [3]\n\nMr Kelly told Sky News that climate policy was a large contributor to Labor\u2019s election defeat because voters realised that CO2 reductions couldn\u2019t be solely achieved in the electricity sector. He claimed Labor would have to \"go out and start slaughtering the dairy cows\u201d and \u201ctake planes out of the sky\u201d to achieve their emission reductions in agriculture and transport but the result would \u201csmash the economy, kill jobs and cause hardship and poverty\". [1]\n\nThree of Australia\u2019s biggest sources of CO2 emissions come from electricity generation, transport and agriculture, according to the latest quarterly update of Australia\u2019s National Greenhouse Inventory. It found electricity was the biggest CO2 emitter and accounted for 33.2 per cent of all emissions - 0.1 per cent off a third. [4]\n\nThe quarterly update also states the electricity sector has \"experienced the largest growth\" in emissions - just under 40 per cent - since 1990, when the National Greenhouse Inventory began. The waste and agriculture sectors have decreased their CO2 emissions since 1990. [4]\n\nIn the year to December 2018 electricity generation emissions fell by 3.5 per cent. The 2018 levels are down 15.5 per cent from the peak recorded in the year to June 2009. [4]\n\nThe second biggest CO2 emitter in 2018 was stationary energy, which includes manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors with 19.1 per cent. Transport accounted for 18.9 per cent of emissions and agriculture 12.9 per cent. [4] [6]\n\nBased on the figures AAP FactCheck concludes that Mr Kelly\u2019s claim on electricity generation emissions is correct.", "lang": "en"}
