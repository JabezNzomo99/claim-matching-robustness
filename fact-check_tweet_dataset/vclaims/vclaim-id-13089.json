He was beaten up with chappals -translated)\u201d.\n\nOne Amit Mishra, who is an AAP supporter, tweeted the same video with the above message, which has been retweeted close to 600 times at the time of filing this article. It was retweeted by Ankit Lal, the social media in-charge of the Aam Aadmi Party and by a verified social media handle, @aartic02. The message also intends to take a jibe at the BJP\u2019s \u201cMain Bhi Chowkidar\u201d campaign. While MP Congress\u2019 account identified the man as a BJP leader, Amit Mishra claims that he is a BJP MLA.\n\nMany other individuals have quote-tweeted Mishra\u2019s tweet with a similar narrative. A Facebook page, Save Maharastra From BJP, has also shared the video with an identical message.\n\nAlt News found that the video shared on social media is not only old but the information propagated along with the video is incorrect and incomplete. In Oct 2018, a video of a woman beating up a man with slippers went viral on social media. Later, it was reported that the video is of a BJP worker who was beaten up by the wife of an IPS officer for allegedly harassing her. ABP News also reported on this issue, a video of which was uploaded on their YouTube channel on October 7, 2018. Now, a video which has been created by merging the ABP News video with the viral clip is circulating on social media, but without adding adequate information, in order to mislead social media users.\n\nThe man beaten up by the woman is not a BJP MLA but a BJP worker named Ashwini Arora from Rudrapur, Uttarakhand. The woman in the video beating Arora with slippers is the wife of a police officer and not the wife of an IAS officer as claimed. Speaking to Hindustan Times in October 2018, Devendra Shahi, president of Metropolise resident welfare society said, \u201cA BJP worker of Sitarganj lives with his family in our society. He was sending obscene messages on her mobile. She rang us and told about her plight on Saturday. On learning this, we went to the BJP worker\u2019s flat, but instead of realising his fault, he started misbehaving with us\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the same video had gone viral in October, where the woman was seen accusing the BJP worker of harassing her and beating him for the same.", "lang": "en"}
