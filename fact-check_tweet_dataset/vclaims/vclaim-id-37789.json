We were directed to multiple news reports featuring screenshots from the video. We found that the incident occurred in Tripura on March 5, 2018, when BJP supporters brought down a statue of Lenin. The statue was located in south Tripura's Bellonia town. This was after the BJP swept the elections in Tripura that year ending 25 years of Communist rule. \n\n BJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav had also shared the video in a now deleted tweet.\n\n\n\nSeveral offices of the CPI(M) were also attacked following the results. Two statues of Lenin in Tripura and another of Tamil reformer Periyar were vandalised in Vellore in quick succession at that time. On March 7, 2019 then Home Minister Rajnath Singh expressed his disapproval of the incidents of vandalism in a public statement.\n\nBOOM looked up for a BJP leader named Karani Singh on Myneta.info, a database on Indian Lawmakers by Association for Democratic Reforms but could not find any BJP leader by the same name.", "lang": "en"}
