The clip also shows the presidential candidate making a supposed gaffe by saying \u201cI love kids jumping on my lap.\u201d\n\nThis clip comes from a genuine video of Biden speaking at a public event.\n\nThis video was taken in June 2017 as the city of Wilmington, Delaware, renamed a public pool after the former vice president and 2020 presidential contender. Biden served as a lifeguard as a young man at what was then called the \u201cPrices Run Park Pool\u201d and said he was honored to see it renamed the \u201cJoseph R. Biden Jr. Aquatic Center.\u201d\n\nAs a teenager in the summer of 1962, former Vice President Joe Biden worked as a lifeguard at what was known as the Prices Run swimming pool in Wilmington, Delaware. On Monday, the aquatic facility at Brown-Burton Winchester Park was renamed the Joseph R. Biden Sr. Aquatic Center in his honor. \u201cI was a kid from suburbia,\u201d Biden, who lived in Mayfield, Delaware, at the time, told the audience during the dedication speech. \u201cI wanted to get more involved. And I realized I lived in a neighborhood where I\u2019d turn on the television and I\u2019d see and listen to Dr. [Martin Luther] King and others. But I didn\u2019t know any black people. No, I really didn\u2019t. And you didn\u2019t know any white people, either. That\u2019s the truth. So I wanted to work here.\u201d\n\nThis video was originally broadcast on the government public access channel WITN Channel 22. The full video can seen here. The portion of Biden\u2019s speech included in the viral clip can be seen around the 30:45 mark.\n\nThe viral clip of Biden talking about his hairy legs is real but it is missing some context. It comes from a much longer set of remarks that Biden delivered in the summer of 2017 after the public pool was renamed in his honor. Biden mentioned the blonde, curly hair on his legs while talking about his experience as a white man working at a public pool that was predominantly attended by black patrons.\n\nInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time a segment from this speech went viral. In September 2019, a portion of the speech involving a story about a man named \u201cCornPop\u201d went viral because social media users doubted the veracity of Biden\u2019s anecdote. It turned out, however, that Biden was largely telling the truth about his run-in with gang member CornPop:\n\nOver the weekend, a 2017 video of Biden telling the engrossing tale surfaced on the internet. It met with widespread disbelief. Some questioned whether CornPop ever existed. Others were skeptical about the very idea of a chain-wielding Biden facing off with three armed gang members. It turns out, however, that the presidential candidate might have been telling the truth. A former state president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had supported Biden\u2019s yarn. So did a newspaper obituary. The footage of the CornPop anecdote was filmed when Biden attended the renaming of a swimming pool and park in Wilmington. The former Delaware senator recalled that, as a young man, he had been a security guard there, one of very few white employees. He then launched into his story. \u201cCornPop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys,\u201d he said.\n\nIn sum, the viral video of Biden talking about his hairy legs is real. It comes from a much longer set of remarks that Biden delivered in the summer of 2017 after the public pool where he worked as a teenager was renamed in his honor.", "lang": "en"}
