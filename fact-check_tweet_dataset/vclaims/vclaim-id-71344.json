We came across an article on BBC Science Focus magazine stating that the likelihood of this phenomenon taking place is extremely rare.\n\nAccording to the above article, such an event, if ever, would take place next in May 2492.\n\nMoreover, there is no evidence to prove that lighting a candle or a Diya would kill coronavirus. Here\u2019s the public advisory issued by WHO.\n\nHence this news is fake.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
