To become a frequent user send this message to 10 people who receive it (2 ticks) and your WhatsApp logo will change color. Send this to 8 people to activate the new whatsapp. Saturday morning whatsapp will become chargeable. If you have at least 10 contacts send them this message. In this way we will see that you are an avid user and your logo will become blue (\ud83d\udd35) and will remain free. (As discussed in the paper today. Whatsapp will cost 0.01\u20ac per message.
