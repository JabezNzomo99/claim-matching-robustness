Some of the footage shows Obama delivering a speech about gun violence, while the rest shows him speaking at a memorial service for slain police officers.\n\nThe viral clip circulated amid nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality after George Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis police custody. In the video, Obama appears to break down in tears as he starts speaking.\n\n\u201cEvery time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.

He does not cry in this portion of the video.\n\n\u201cWhile some suffer far more under racism\u2019s burden, some feel, to a far greater extent, discrimination\u2019s sting,\u201d he states in this latter footage. \u201cAlthough most of us do our best to guard against it, and teach our children better, none of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune.\u201d\n\nThe caption claims that the video shows Obama \u201cshed tears during press conference to address racism against black people in America.\u201d But the video splices together clips from two different speeches, leaving out important context.\n\nIn the first part of the video, Obama is giving a January 2016 speech about some new executive actions he had taken in the area of gun control. CBS News posted a video featuring part of this address on Youtube. No mention of racism appears in Time\u2019s transcript of the speech.\n\nThe children that Obama was referring to in that clip were victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nThe second part of the video shows Obama speaking at a July 2016 memorial service for five Dallas police officers killed by a gunman during a protest over police use of force. C-SPAN posted the entirety of the speech on YouTube.\n\nObama tweeted a statement about Floyd\u2019s death on May 29.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be \u2018normal\u2019 in 2020 America,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt can\u2019t be \u2018normal.\u2019 If we want our children to group up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
