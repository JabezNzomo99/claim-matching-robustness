This is false, and similar tales of abduction by strangers in crowded areas have been commonplace since the first days of the internet.\n\nAccording to the false story, a young child was abducted from a bathroom at Canada\u2019s Wonderland in Vaughan, Ontario, while the mother was changing her other child. Notified, park security guards locked down the venue, and found the missing child nine minutes later, with a shaved head and different clothes intended to disguise the young victim.\n\nScreenshot of a Facebook post taken on August 6, 2019 The hoax was shared on Facebook in the first days of August as a screenshot of an Instagram post, which was itself already a screenshot of a Facebook post. However, the story never took place, Ontario police and representatives for Canada\u2019s Wonderland told AFP. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any report for any incident like that, so we\u2019re trying to verify where this has come from,\u201d said Constable Laura Nicolle of the York Regional Police, the law enforcement organization in charge of policing Vaughan. \u201cThere is no truth to the story and there has never been an incident like this at the park. The safety and security of our guests is our number one priority,\u201d Grace Peacock, director of communications for the theme park, told AFP. Peacock added that the theme park had already been the target of a similar fable several years ago.\n\nTales of children abducted by strangers in public areas have captivated the public imagination for a long time. According to Snopes, a website that began covering digital disinformation in the 1990s, stories similar to the Canada\u2019s Wonderland abduction used to circulate via email chains before migrating to Facebook.\n\nMany of the stories follow a similar pattern. They are usually presented as accounts from a friend or relative of the original poster, and go on to recount child abduction attempts in public places, be it an amusement park, a mall, or a supermarket. The resolution is positive, with the child found, but dressed in a distinct attire and with either a shaved head or dyed hair, supposedly a frightening proof of the level of organization and premeditation of the kidnappers.\n\n\u201cWe do see hoaxes like this every once in a while, and frankly it\u2019s quite discouraging for us, because if these are made up, we don\u2019t want to be facing a desensitized media or public in the event that a real abduction does occur,\u201d Robert Lowery, vice-president of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children\u2019s Missing Children Division, told AFP.\n\nUsually false, sometimes based on true events\n\nThough the stories that become viral are usually hoaxes, they can be rooted in true events. \u201cWe have heard of that scenario, and we\u2019ve seen that, although I want to emphasize that it\u2019s extremely rare,\u201d Lowery said of the swapped clothes story.\n\nLowery added that he has never heard of the scenario described above in an amusement park setting, which he described as \u201csome of the safest places we can take our children to,\u201d due to the training that security guards there go through, cameras, and the capacity to lock down premises.\n\nThe data we have on child abductions further refutes the idea that strangers generally loom in public spaces in the hope of kidnapping children. In Canada and in the United States, the majority of child abductions are carried out by a child\u2019s relative.\n\nAccording to data from Canada\u2019s National Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains, only 27 children were abducted by strangers out of 42,233 reports of missing minors in 2018. The report adds that 92 percent of missing minor reports were removed from the list within a week, and that 73 percent of cases are runaways.\n\nAbductions by strangers \u201care so rare that when they do happen, the impact is great and that\u2019s why people are so fearful of stranger abduction,\u201d Karen Chymy, director of operations for MissingKids.ca, a resource center for missing children, told AFP.", "lang": "en"}
