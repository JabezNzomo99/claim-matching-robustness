Manny Pacquiao\u2019s, are luring netizens into joining a fake online giveaway worth \u201c$500,000,000.\u201d\n\nThis is the second time this month -- and the third time since January -- that VERA Files flagged bogus raffles on FB done by poser accounts of Pacquiao. (See: VERA FILES FACT CHECK: \u2018Pacquiao\u2019 FB page promotes FAKE raffle and VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Imposter \u2018Pacquiao\u2019 FB accounts post FAKE US500M giveaway)\n\nOn March 21, an FB netizen used a photo of the senator-athlete as a display image, while page Viral Trend PH published on March 27 mechanics of a \u201craffle\u201d where Pacquiao was to choose only \u201c300 winners.\u201d\n\nPointing out explicitly that it \u201cis not a fraud,\u201d the accounts claimed winners may take home a cash prize and the amount would depend on their first name. All the letters from A to Z bore a corresponding amount between 10 and 90 million. To join, one merely has to share the post with five other FB groups. After 15 minutes, the prize would supposedly be deposited in the winner's account.\n\nThis is a hoax, and reflects the same mechanics of a bogus giveaway that VERA Files Fact Check has previously debunked.\n\nThe senator's foundation published on March 21 an advisory warning people against scams. \"We have been receiving messages from people claiming that they won a certain amount from our foundation. The Manny Pacquiao Foundation is currently not running any contests, raffles or sms promos,\u201d the post read. \u201cIn line with this, any messages sent to you saying that you won our \u2018raffle\u2019 is clearly a scheme to phish information from you.\u201d\n\nTo give the impression it was Pacquiao who made the posts, the fake raffle announcements carried an image and video of him.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s version, which has been shared over 3,200 times, featured an image of Pacquiao and his family during his 41st birthday last December, taken by Pacquiao\u2019s official photographer Wendell Alinea. A copy of it is available in an ABS-CBN report. Viral Trend PH\u2019s copy, shared more than 1,500 times, carried a 2017 video of Pacquiao thanking the Cayman Islands for warmly welcoming him to the island.\n\nThe fake giveaway was posted and widely shared on social media days after it was announced -- through the official FB page of the Manny Pacquiao Foundation -- that Alibaba founder Jack Ma would be donating 50,000 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) test kits to the Philippines.", "lang": "en"}
