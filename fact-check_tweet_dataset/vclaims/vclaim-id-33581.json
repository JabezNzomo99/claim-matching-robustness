The claim is that the incident took place in the Telangana state. Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of it. \n\n\n\nWhen one goes through the video, the language heard isn\u2019t Telugu. Also, in the comments section, a few users have written that the video is related to Karnataka. \n\n\n\nWhen the video in the post is fragmented using \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, many keyframes were obtained. When those keyframes were subjected to Google reverse image search with a filter in Kannada \u2018\u0caa\u0cca\u0cb2\u0cc0\u0cb8\u0ccd \u0cb9\u0cc6\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cae\u0cc6\u0c9f\u0ccd\u2019 (which means \u2018Police helmet\u2019), a keyframe was found in the article of \u2018Public Tv\u2019. As per this article, the Hassan City Traffic Police as a part of their \u2018Half-Helmets Operation\u2019 have broken down half-helmets worn by the motorcyclists. Information from a video of a YouTube news channel also corroborates that the incident in the video took place in Hassan(Karnataka). \n\n\n\nDuring the search process, a tweet by the \u2018Cyberabad Traffic Police\u2019 regarding the video was also found. In this tweet, they have clarified that the video isn\u2019t from Hyderabad and also, asked people not to wear half-helmets as they are incapable of protecting the head. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, the video is not related to the Telangana state. It shows Hassan(Karnataka) Traffic Police breaking the half-helmets worn by motorcyclists. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
