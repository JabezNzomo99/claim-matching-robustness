When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\n\nThat\u2019s really it as far as constitutional rules and guidance on impeachment. \u201cWhile the framers very clearly envisaged the occasional necessity of initiating impeachment proceedings, they put in place only a very general framework to guide future action,\u201d according to the Senate Historical Office. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 1993 that the Senate had the \u201csole\u201d power to try impeachment charges and that the courts could not step in to resolve disputes.\n\nWhere else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation, to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the representatives of the people, his accusers? Could the Supreme Court have been relied upon as answering this description? It is much to be doubted. \u2026 The awful discretion which a court of impeachments must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the community, forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of persons.\n\n\u201cShortly after Rehnquist takes his chair elevated above the rows of wooden desks, he will ask senators to swear that they will render \u2018impartial justice\u2019 as jurors evaluating the fate of a president,\u201d The Washington Post reported at the time. \u201cThat oath immediately distinguishes the Senate role from that of the House, since the Constitution gives the House the power to impeach, or indict, a public official, and reserves for the Senate the neutral role of determining whether those allegations are true and what should be done about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the White House wants to work with the House, we are ready to do so,\u201d Etienne said. \u201cThe speaker has said that we want to be and will be fair to the president. But the president\u2019s claims regarding a supposed lack of due process are self-evidently in bad faith. Far from seeking to participate in the House\u2019s inquiry, the president has evinced nothing but contempt for the House\u2019s hearings and other investigative proceedings and has actively used his powers of office to block committees\u2019 access to critical witnesses and evidence.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
