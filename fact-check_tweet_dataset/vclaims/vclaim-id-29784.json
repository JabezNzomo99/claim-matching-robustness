Even so, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway both falsely claimed that Trump never made such a threat.\n\nTrump first made such remarks in a tweet on Jan. 4, and then doubled down on his warning when talking to reporters a day later on Air Force One.\n\nIn two tweets, Trump said: \u201cLet this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have\u2026.. targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet came two days after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, threatened \u201csevere revenge\u201d for the death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad\u2019s airport on Jan. 2.\n\nThe president\u2019s critics claimed that attacking cultural sites would violate international law. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar said attacks on cultural sites constitute \u201cwar crimes,\u201d although that may or may not be the case \u2014 depending on the circumstances.\n\nInternational law \u2014 specifically the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict \u2014 prohibits \u201cany act of hostility\u201d against fixed cultural property, \u201csuch as museums, large libraries and depositories of archives,\u201d as well as \u201cmovable\u201d property, such as art, manuscripts and books. The protections \u201cmay be waived only in cases where military necessity imperatively requires such a waiver.\u201d\n\n\u201c[A]lthough international law does provide special protection to certain cultural sites, attacking them (or threatening to do so) is not always a war crime as the legislators seem to think,\u201d Ret. Gen. Charles J. Dunlap Jr., the former deputy judge advocate general of the United States Air Force, wrote in a Jan. 6 blog post for Duke University, where he is a law professor.\n\nIn response to his Democratic critics, Trump defended his position and reiterated his threat to attack Iranian cultural sites.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re allowed to kill our people. They\u2019re allowed to torture and maim our people. They\u2019re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we\u2019re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d the president told reporters Jan. 5 on Air Force One.\n\nEven so, two top administration officials falsely denied that Trump ever threatened Iranian cultural sites.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t say he\u2019d go after a cultural site. Read what he said very closely,\u201d Pompeo said, referring to Trump\u2019s tweet, in a Jan. 5 interview on \u201cSunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo\u201d on Fox News.\n\nAfter Trump doubled down on his threat, Conway told reporters at a Jan. 6 press briefing, \u201cHe didn\u2019t say he\u2019s targeting cultural sites.\u201d\n\nPompeo and Conway stressed that the U.S. will act within the law if it strikes any targets in Iran.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Pompeo told host George Stephanopoulos: \u201cWe\u2019ll behave lawfully. We\u2019ll behave inside the system. We always have and we always will, George. You know that.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks to reporters, Conway said: \u201cSecretary Pompeo said yesterday that we will be within the law.\u201d\n\nConway went on to say, \u201cI think that Iran has many military, strategic military sites that you may cite are also cultural sites.\u201d The White House declined to name any, but as Dunlap wrote it is possible that a cultural site could become a legitimate military target in certain situations.\n\nStill, Conway and Pompeo were wrong when they claimed that Trump didn\u2019t say he would target cultural sites. He did so. Twice.", "lang": "en"}
