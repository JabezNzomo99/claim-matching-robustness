The people in the picture are actually American troops returning to the \"Big Apple\" in 1945, at the end of World War II.\n\n\u201cThis scene typifies how a boatload of Italian Immigrants would have looked as they sought a better life,\u201d the caption of this Facebook post reads. The same photo was shared over 60,000 times across different social networks in English, Spanish, French, and Italian.\n\nShared with implied criticism of current US immigration policies, this is not a photo of Italian migrants, as many internet users pointed out.\n\nThe original photo is featured in the New York Historical Society (NYHS) collections, and is most notably highlighted on NYHS blog \u201cThe Hyphen\u201d. The caption explains that in 1945, \u201cCrowded ships brought American troops back to (the) New York harbor for months after V-E Day.\u201d This particular photo is from May 8, 1945.\n\nSeveral internet users, as well as the ship-specialized website liverpoolships.org, pointed out that the ship is the Queen Elizabeth, used during World War II for troop transport.\n\nAsked for more information about the photo, NYHS told AFP in an email that this photo was taken from its World War II Photograph Collection. It was taken in 1945 by US Third Naval District Coast Guards, and was featured in a file about the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth liners.", "lang": "en"}
