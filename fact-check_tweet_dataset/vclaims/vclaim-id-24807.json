If you sit more than 11 hours a day, there\u2019s a 50% chance you\u2019ll die within the next 3 years,\u201d reads a\n\nThe post doesn\u2019t give more details on if this is uninterrupted sitting or the total of the time spent sitting in a day.\n\nOther internet sites have also linked prolonged sitting to premature death, with\n\ngiving the risk as a lower 40% for the same 11 hours.\n\nBut do we drastically shorten our lives by sitting for long periods of time?\n\nThere\u2019s little available information about the \u2018Medical Talk\u2019 Facebook page that posted the claim. We also did not trace any research that pointed to a 50% chance of dying within the next three years due to a high sitting time.\n\non the link between sitting time and mortality and published in peer reviewed journal\n\nThe study of 222,497 Australian adults 45 and older concluded that\n\nthe risk of death increases when a person sits for\n\nlong. This was after factoring in for variables such as sex, age, education, physical activity, body mass index and disability.\n\nThe study was widely reported at the time by international publishers such as\n\n. Both reported that the research had found that those\n\nwho sat for 11 or more hours a day\n\n, compared with those who sat for only four hours a day.\n\nWe then asked experts if the 50% claim was valid.\n\n, a Canadian university specialising in online education. He has done wide\n\non health outcomes related to sitting behavior and physical activity.\n\nfrom \u201cthe scientific evidence we have, all we know is that compared to people that sit the least, people who sit the most (over 9 or 10 hrs per day) have an approximately 20% increased risk of premature mortality\u201d.\n\nEmmanuel Stamatakis, told Africa Check that the 50% statistic is \u201ca bogus claim\u201d.\n\nThis statistic is nonsense, far from what the whole body evidence of research shows.\n\nStamatakis is a professor of physical activity, lifestyle, and population health at the\n\n\u2019s medicine and health faculty. His research covers health behaviour \u2013 such as sitting \u2013 and its influence on\n\nheart, lung, metabolic and mental diseases, and the risk of death.\n\n\u201cSitting is a health risk in physically inactive populations,\u201d Stamatakis said. But, he said, \u201ceven meeting the lower moderate to vigorous\n\n\u201cThere is no study showing that there is a 50% death chance to die in the next\n\nStamatakis said no scientist had calculated the risk of death for \u201cany risk factor\u201d. These risk factors could include smoking, high blood pressure, physical activity, sitting and \u201canything else\u201d, he said.\n\nUlf Ekelund, a professor of sports medicine at the\n\n, is the lead author of\n\non the role of physical activity in reducing the risk for premature mortality.\n\nby Ekelund and his colleagues found that \u201chigh levels of moderate intensity physical activity, 60 to 75 minutes per day, seem to eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time\u201d.\n\nHowever, the study also said that \u201cthis high activity level attenuates, but does not eliminate the increased risk associated with high TV-viewing time\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen the authors excluded all those who reported any disease at baseline and only examined those who were healthy, this association completely disappeared.\u201d\n\nHe told Africa Check he thinks the meme\u2019s claim \u201cis unsubstantiated\u201d.\n\nConclusion: No evidence for 50% higher death risk claim, but do exercise more\n\nsitting for over 11 hours a day means you have a 50% chance of dying within the next three years.\n\nExperts told Africa Check that while high sitting time is a health risk including for premature death, no study has measureds this death risk as 50%.\n\nFurther, physical activity significantly reduces the risk of premature death.
