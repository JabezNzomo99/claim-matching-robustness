Shefali Vaidya also shared the video.\n\nWhile Mamata Banerjee did chant Islamic verses, the video tweeted by BJP Bengal was clipped out of a much longer broadcast where the West Bengal CM can also be heard reciting Hindu and Sikh prayers. Banerjee\u2019s original speech was uploaded by AITC in January 2018 where the CM was inaugurating the Mati Utsav to mark the growth of the agricultural sector in the state.\n\nAt 21:28 minutes, she prays to Hindu deity Durga to bring prosperity in everybody\u2019s lives and goes on to chant, \u201cSarva Mangala Mangalye Shive Sarvartha Sadhike Sharanye Tryambake Gauri Narayani Namostute\u2026\u201d This is followed by Islamic prayers (22:00 minutes) that could be heard in the clipped video. At 21:15 minutes, she says, \u201cMay God bless all,\u201d which is followed by the Sikh chants of \u201cWahe Guru Ji Da Khalsa, Wahe Guru Di Fateh.\u201d In the end, she can says, \u201cSaare jahan se acha Hindustan humara.\u201d\n\nBJP Bengal, therefore, tweeted a clipped video of Mamata Banerjee to portray her as a \u2018Muslim sympathiser\u2019. The party had earlier used a photograph from the 2014 California wildfires to show political vandalism by the TMC after BJP minority leader Nur Islam Gazi\u2019s house was burned down.\n\n\u201cTime for JehadiMamta to move to Saudi Arabia or Pakistan,\u201d tweeted Madhu Kishwar on May 19, 2019 while posting the same video. Kishwar has been found circulating misinformation several times in the past, including manufacturing a page in DMK manifesto to show the party favouring Muslims over Hindus. Kishwar was also pulled by the J&K police in 2018 for sharing fake news.\n\nThe video was also circulating on Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
