However, the claim is false. The finance ministry has dismissed the page as bogus and said the grant announcement was a hoax.\n\nThe grant announcement was posted on June 30, 2020, on a Facebook page called \u201cSouth Sudan ministry of finance and planning\u201d. The post claims that the South Sudanese government is handing out grants worth $41.4 million to entrepreneurs and farmers as part of an economic development programme that aims to promote local investment.\n\n\u201cApplicants MUST be South Sudanese citizens aged between 23-57 years,\u201d the post adds.\n\nThe post includes an application linked to a Google document, which asks people for their personal information, including contact details and information about their businesses.\n\nHowever, the claim is false. The finance ministry issued a statement on its official Facebook page on July 7, 2020, saying it had never announced any such grant and dismissed the hoax as the work of \u201chackers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge the public to be vigilant and disregard such information as a mere media scam; the ministry did not send out any forms to anyone and encourage citizens to dispute that the forms circulating on social media to be filled by entrepreneurs to get access to the alleged funds as fake forms,\u201d the ministry\u2019s post reads.\n\nMinistry officials added that any announcement of the sort would be posted on its official Facebook page as a document with the government\u2019s logo.\n\nThe bogus Facebook page has 257 followers and 247 likes and was opened a month ago. Page information shows that it is being run from Kenya.\n\nMeanwhile, the ministry\u2019s official page, called South Sudan\u2019s Ministry of Finance & Planning, has 672 followers and 645 likes and is being managed inside the country. It was also created this year, but in March.\n\nAFP Fact Check recently debunked other bogus government pages in Zambia and Botswana, and in Uganda, where similar scams were being posted.", "lang": "en"}
