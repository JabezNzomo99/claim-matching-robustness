Since we haven\u2019t explored it in depth, we decided to take a more thorough look at what this figure means, and explain exactly why it doesn\u2019t hold water.\n\n\u201cUnemployed\u201d refers to people who are available for work and actively looking for a job, but don\u2019t have one. \u201cNot in the labor force\u201d refers to people who are not looking for jobs because they have given up looking, or are not interested \u2014 such as students. Students working part time while going to school are counted in the \u201cemployed\u201d category.\n\nThat means Trump is counting students who are not looking for work as a part of the \u201cunemployed\u201d population. Technically, those students don\u2019t have jobs. But that does not fit the definition of \u201cunemployed\u201d and is especially problematic for this age group, because the number of people who aren\u2019t looking for jobs includes people who are in school full time.\n\nConsider a 16-year-old high school sophomore, who is going to school full time and engaged in extracurricular activities when not in school. The student doesn\u2019t have a job but isn\u2019t looking for one. Counting the student as \u201cunemployed\u201d \u2014 defined as a person who\u2019s looking for a job but can\u2019t find one \u2014 doesn\u2019t tell you anything about the labor market.\n\nThe difference in Asian youth rates may reflect a cultural factor, Millsap said. Fewer Asian youths may be in the labor force because they are more devoted to school and work less, even part time. But their BLS unemployment rate may be lower because Asian youth are more successful at finding a job if they look for one.\n\nA campaign official previously told the Fact Checker that its calculation \u201cis a more comprehensive reflection of disengagement from the labor force than the unemployment rate,\u201d as it includes those who are not finding work because they are discouraged from previous attempts at employment. But the campaign did not respond to our latest inquiry, specifically for this fact check, for an explanation of why the campaign includes those who are not interested in looking for work (i.e., students).\n\nIf Trump really is interested in the rate of disengagement among black youth, there is an academically accepted measure he can use. It\u2019s called NEET, which stands for \u201cNeither Employed nor in Education or Training.\u201d This measure factors out students altogether, and measures the share of disconnected youth aged 16 to 24.\n\nPer Trump\u2019s math, a 24-year-old college graduate who is actively looking for a job but can\u2019t find one is in the same situation as a 16-year-old high school sophomore who is in school full time and going to band practice or playing on a school sports team when not in class.\n\nAnd per Trump\u2019s math, more Asian youth are unemployed than black youth \u2014 even though Asian youth have a lower official BLS unemployment rate than whites or blacks. So Trump ends up using a calculation for black youth that greatly exaggerates the actual number of people who can\u2019t find a job even though they are trying, while minimizing their rate in the context of Asian youth.\n\nWe previously awarded Four Pinocchios to Trump\u2019s absurd calculation that the \u201creal unemployment rate\u201d is 42 percent \u2014 about eight times higher than the official BLS rate. He applies the same junk analysis for the black youth unemployment rate, which defies internationally accepted measures of unemployment while ignoring an actual measure of disengaged youth that could prove his point. We award Trump Four more Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
