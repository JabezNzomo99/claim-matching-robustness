The photo has been doctored from an original image which makes no mention of polygamy.\n\nThe doctored photo has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here and here, and shows two women wearing hijabs holding a sign with the logo of Indonesia\u2019s Justice and Prosperous Party which appears to say: \u201c2 children are enough, 1 wife is not enough\u201d.\n\nThe same photo is also found here on the website dukungpoligami.com -- the URL means Support Polygamy.\n\nHere is the official website of Indonesia\u2019s Justice and Prosperous Party, also known as PKS, which displays the same logo as is seen on the banners in the misleading post.\n\nOne Facebook post, posted on April 5, 2019, has a caption saying: \u201cThe party of genitals and groins.\u201d\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the post:\n\nAnother Facebook post which shares the same image has a caption saying: \u201cEven as a man I am sad to see something like this, let alone women? Rejecting feminism but when in a hospital they want a woman doctor to treat them. My heart is sad but I want to shut their mouth using used Softex.\u201d\n\nSoftex is a reference to sanitary pads in Indonesia.\n\nIn the upper right-hand corner of the photo, there is text across the image that says: \u201c#2019 add more wives.\u201d\n\nA Google reverse image search found that the photo actually shows a recent PKS campaign event ahead of nationwide elections on April 17, 2019.\n\nThis video posted on the party\u2019s official YouTube account on January 19, 2019 shows images from the party campaign event in West Java province, near the Indonesian capital Jakarta.\n\nThe title of the video says: \u201cMothers are excited to attend a flash mob held by PKS Rangkapan Jaya Baru,\u201d a reference to Rangkapan Jaya Baru sub-district in West Java, where the campaign was held.\n\nIn the video at 0:07 the same scene as appears in the misleading image can be seen.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the video showing the same two women holding a white banner:\n\nThe banners held by the two women have a large number \u201c8\u201d alongside the party\u2019s logo.\n\nNumber \u201c8\u201d is the party\u2019s number in the ballot paper. Here is their party number on the election commission\u2019s website.\n\nIn the right-hand top corner of the image in the video, there is a hashtag that says: \u201c2019 Choose PKS\u201d.\n\nBelow is an image comparing the doctored image (L) with a screenshot from the original video. AFP has highlighted identical features in red:\n\nA different video of the same campaign event was uploaded to YouTube on December 26, 2018.\n\nThe video\u2019s caption here claims the campaign event took place on December 25, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the video:", "lang": "en"}
