The picture allegedly shows O\u2019Rourke nearly naked with words painted onto his body, such as \u201cfeminist,\u201d \u201cnon-binary\u201d and \u201cnaturist.\u201d\n\nThough this person may bear a passing resemblance to O\u2019Rourke, the photo does not show the presidential hopeful. It actually shows a participant in a gay pride parade that happened in Athens, Greece, several years ago. Photographer Giorgos Georgiou captured a similar image, dated June 11, 2016, at that parade.\n\nAs it turns out, O\u2019Rourke spoke at the El Paso High School commencement ceremony on the same date, FactCheck.org discovered, so it is impossible that he was in Greece at the time of the parade.", "lang": "en"}
