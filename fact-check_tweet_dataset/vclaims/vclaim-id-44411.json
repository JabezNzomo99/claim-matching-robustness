This is false; the remarks were made by a Virginia resident with the same name.\n\n\u201cHere are some interesting points to think about prior to 2020, especially to my friends on the fence,\u201d the post -- which includes a picture of Allen and has been shared here and here -- quotes him as saying.\n\n\u201cWomen are upset at Trump\u2019s naughty words -- they also bought 80 million copies of 50 Shades of Gray,\u201d it said, alongside criticism of defeated 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, her husband Bill, and their daughter, Chelsea.\n\n\u201cWe are one election away from open borders, socialism, gun confiscation, and full-term abortion nationally. We are fighting evil.\u201d\n\nA post on Instagram by Trump\u2019s son, Eric, in September 2019 includes a quote from the same comments shared on Facebook, alongside a photo of Allen.\n\nThe misattribution of the quotes apparently dates to August 2019, when Tim Allen, a 60-year-old who works at a jewelry store in Virginia, published a post on his Facebook account.\n\nHe told AFP by phone that he shared the post \u201ca while ago\u201d and got it \u201cfrom somebody else\u201d on Facebook, and that he was not aware his post had been attributed to the comedian.\n\nThe actor Tim Allen, 66, best known for his starring role as Tim \u2018The Toolman\u2019 Taylor in the American sitcom, \u201cHome Improvement,\u201d and as the voice of Buzz Lightyear in the Toy Story movies, had nothing to do with the post.\n\nHis publicist, Marleah Leslie, told AFP by email that it \u201cwas not written by my client Tim Allen.\u201d\n\nThe content shared on Facebook is similar to other material circulating online, such as this tweet, as well as this opinion piece and this Facebook post from singer and guitar player Ted Nugent published prior to the one by Tim Allen of Virginia.\n\nSome comments included with shares of the Facebook post refer to the actor as a \u201cconservative in a land of liberals\u201d or the \u201clast man standing,\u201d the name of his current sitcom, in which he plays a conservative character with snarky lines targeting Democrats.\n\nThe comedian backed Republican presidential candidate John Kasich in 2015 and attended Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2016.\n\nThe Washington Post and Snopes are among other media organisations who have debunked the Facebook post.", "lang": "en"}
