However, a presidential spokesperson dismissed the claim as \u201cfake news\u201d. No evidence was found to show Kagame made the comments. In fact, he has said his government is avoiding untested remedies.\n\nIn April, Madagascan President Andry Rajoelina launched a herbal concoction that he touts as a remedy for COVID-19. The drink was developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA) from indigenous herbs containing artemisia -- a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment.\n\nHowever, the WHO has warned against \u201cadopting a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy\u201d while the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said the infusion should be \u201ctested rigorously\u201d.\n\nPresident Rajoelina has defended the potion and even had it shipped to Tanzania and Nigeria. As reported by AFP, Madagascar's official body in charge of drug control has not approved the drink for sale in the country.\n\nOne article circulating on Facebook that also claims Kagame said he wished former Libyan and Zimbabwean rulers, Muammar Gaddafi and Robert Mugabe, were still alive to fight for Africa, has been shared here on Facebook more than 9,000 times.\n\nA similar article quotes Kagame as saying \u201cenough is enough! no one from foreign countries will ever rule or control Africa again! We are united and strong as one! We will defend our people and our continent Africa. We are not cheap to be corrupted by WHO or evil people (sic).\u201d\n\nThe article has been shared here and here.\n\nThe hoax articles claim that Kagame \u201chas stepped into a fight against\u201d the WHO. However, AFP Fact Check found no public record of Kagame opposing the health body's COVID-19 policies in local and international media.\n\nWhen US President Donald Trump criticised WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\u2019s handling of the pandemic in April, Kagame said the WHO \u201chas the full confidence and support of Africa\u201d.\n\nContacted by AFP Fact Check, a spokesperson for the office of the Rwandan government said the articles were \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nKagame said at a virtual press conference in April that he and other Rwandan leaders \u201cgive precedence to science\u201d and believed herbal remedies should be treated with caution.\n\nHe was quoted by state-run Rwanda TV as saying \u201cwe accept guidelines by science and not things like witchcraft or statements made by people without scientific evidence to back the effectiveness of such statements, we are avoiding such things\u201d.\n\n\u201cMedical experts and researchers are yet to fully understand the nature of COVID-19, even though some things like how to mitigate its spread have been established and how people can protect themselves from it,\u201d he said.\n\nKagame added that Rwandan researchers were part of global efforts to find a vaccine for the disease.", "lang": "en"}
