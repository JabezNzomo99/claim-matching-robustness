There\u2019s no evidence that her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, is related to George Soros in any way.\n\nThe Clinton family and billionaire Democratic donor George Soros have been the subjects of conspiracy theories for years. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show George Soros In A Nazi Uniform)\n\nThis Facebook post alleges that, through the marriage of Chelsea Clinton to her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, the Clintons have a secret connection to George Soros. \u201cMarc Mezvinsky & wife Chelsea,\u201d reads the caption. \u201c\u201dHe is also George Soros\u2019 nephew.\u201d\n\nActress Roseanne Barr made a similar claim on Twitter last year. The tweet, which has since been deleted, simply said, \u201cChelsea Soros Clinton.\u201d (She later tweeted a correction, but that has also been deleted.)\n\nShortly after Barr tweeted the claim, Chelsea Clinton debunked it on Twitter.\n\n\u201cGood morning Roseanne \u2013 my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soros\u2019s nephews are lovely people. I\u2019m just not married to one. I am grateful for the important work @OpenSociety does in the world. Have a great day!\u201d tweeted Chelsea Clinton.\n\nChelsea Clinton married Marc Mezvinsky in July 2010. He is not related to George Soros, contrary to what the Facebook post claims.\n\nHis parents are Edward Mezvinsky and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, former Democratic representatives of Iowa and Pennsylvania respectively, according to The New York Times. He only has one uncle, Norton Mezvinsky, according to New York Daily News.\n\nGeorge Soros has two nephews, Peter and Jeffrey, by way of his older brother Paul, according to the biography \u201cSoros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire.\u201d Neither are married to Chelsea Clinton \u2013 Jeffrey Soros married Catharine Cosover in 1995 and Peter Soros married Flora Fraser in 1997. Fraser and Peter Soros reportedly separated in 2009.\n\nThe Daily Caller found no media reports linking the Clinton, Soros and Mezvinsky families together in this manner, except for those debunking Barr\u2019s tweet.", "lang": "en"}
