But the country\u2019s population is disputed, so there\u2019s no way to multiply this to get a national figure.\n\u2022 None Two state energy agencies could not supply any numbers for privately owned generators in Nigeria. \n\n\n\nDuring a \u201cspecial open line\u201d segment on his popular morning radio show,\n\nasked South Africans to suggest solutions to the country\u2019s frequent power blackouts instead of \u201cfoaming at the mouth\u201d.\n\ndescribes the scheduled outages \u2013 known locally as\n\n\u2013 as \u201ca measure of last resort\u201d to prevent a countrywide collapse of the electricity grid.\n\nProblems with electricity supply in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, are\n\n.
