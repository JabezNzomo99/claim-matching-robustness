Chauhan suggested that Krishnan faked sustaining injuries during violence in JNU on January 5-6. In two of the photographs, Krishnan can be seen with bandages on his head and both arms which are absent in the third image.\n\nChauhan\u2019s tweet which has over 4,000 retweets reads, \u201cComedy show of the left comrades SFI leader Soori from JNU after being \u201dbrutally injured\u201d in Delhi Seen completely in high spirits while welcomed with garlands in Trivandrum within 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSeveral others also claimed that Soori Krishnan faked his wounds including BJP MP Pratap Simha. He wrote in Kannada, \u201cABVP\u0caf\u0cb5\u0cb0\u0cc1 \u0cb9\u0cca\u0ca1\u0cc6\u0ca6\u0cb0\u0cc1 \u0c8e\u0c82\u0ca6\u0cc1 \u0cae\u0cc8\u0ca4\u0cc1\u0c82\u0cac \u0cac\u0ccd\u0caf\u0cbe\u0c82\u0ca1\u0cc7\u0c9c\u0ccd \u0c95\u0c9f\u0ccd\u0c9f\u0cbf\u0c95\u0cca\u0c82\u0ca1\u0cb5\u0ca8 \u0c97\u0cbe\u0caf\u0c97\u0cb3\u0cc1 \u0c92\u0c82\u0ca6\u0cc7 \u0ca6\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0ca6\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cbf \u0cae\u0cbe\u0caf.\u201d\n\nState in-charge of BJP Odisha IT and social media Prabin Padhy tweeted that Krishnan\u2019s \u201cstitches were removed & wounds were healed in 24 hrs.\u201d\n\nPandit was earlier found retweeting a video which was shared with the false claim that Left parties in JNU attacked ABVP members when in fact the video showed an ABVP student assaulting a member of CPI (ML)-affiliated All India Students Association (AISA).\n\nIn a video statement shared with Alt News, Soori Krishnan shows his wounds thus debunking the false claim that his injuries were not genuine. He claimed, \u201cI was attacked by eight ABVP goons in front of Periyar hostel in JNU. They beat me with iron rods and I am going to show you the injuries I have right now.\u201d Krishnan showed four injuries on his head, two of which were given sutures. He also asserted that he hurt his arms. \u201cI can move my left arm but my right arm has swelling and I have a severe contusion on my shoulder due to which I cannot lift my arm.\u201d Krishnan further explained the absence of bandages on his head. \u201cBecause of the suture tins, they [doctors] said I don\u2019t need to cover my head. I had the covering on my head initially because there was profuse bleeding. Once the bleeding stopped they asked me to not cover my head.\u201d\n\nThe photo-montage below shows a close-up of Krishnan\u2019s head injuries.\n\nThe SFI activist also shared a copy of his outpatient report from AIIMS where he was admitted on January 5. While the report mentions that the patient suffered no fractures, it lists several external injuries \u2013 swelling and tenderness on both forearms and laceration or deep cuts on occipital, frontal and left parietal regions of the head.\n\nThe photograph of Soori Krishnan circulating online to show that his wounds \u2018healed\u2019 within 24 hours was shot at Trivandrum airport. \u201cThere was a reception by left political parties DYFI and SFI,\u201d he informed, adding that he visited Padmavati Medical Foundation in Kollam for further consultation. Dr Harikrishnan, orthopaedic surgeon treating Krishnan, told Alt News, \u201cI have examined Soori Krishnan. He has severe contusions on his left forearm and right shoulder region. There is no fracture but we have restricted movement and he needs 2-3 weeks of medication. He also has mild scalp injuries which will heal in two weeks. But his forearms have severe swelling.\u201d\n\nSFI activist Soori Krishnan\u2019s photographs are therefore circulating with the false claim that he pretended to be injured during JNU violence. Among those who propagated the misinformation was ABVP national organising secretary Ashish Chauhan who tweeted on January 7. However, quite ironically, ABVP leader Janhawi Ojha had posted a list of students injured during the JNU violence a day before. This included Krishnan\u2019s name. Ojha wrote that 15 out of the 23 wounded were ABVP activists. Ojha was the ABVP presidential candidate for JNUSU 2016 elections.\n\nHer January 6 Facebook post reads, \u201cOut of the 23 students who were admitted to AIIMS after JNU violence, 15 were ABVP workers.\u201d But Ojha\u2019s list has only 20 names and none of the individuals was identified with their political affiliations, including Soori Krishnan. The list also features JNUSU president Aishee Ghosh.\n\nIn his video statement, Krishnan has categorically denied any association with ABVP.\n\nSFI activist Soori Krishnan\u2019s photographs were widely circulated on social media to give credence to the false claim that he faked his wounds. A majority of those who shared the untruth are visible supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party. A tweet by @excomradekerala drew close to 4,000 retweets.\n\nA handle infamous for sharing misinformation, Political Kida, made a video out of Krishnan\u2019s welcome at Trivandrum airport.\n\nThe other usual suspects were Vinita Hindustani, @pokershash and The Skin Doctor.\n\n[Update: BJP MP Pratap Simha\u2019s Facebook post has been added to this report.]", "lang": "en"}
