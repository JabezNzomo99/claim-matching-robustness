No, that's not true: the death hoax was published by a liberal satire weblog that usually takes aim at conservatives and Trump supporters but isn't above posting a few boob jokes now and then. Dolly Parton is doing fine.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Conservative Tears on January 10, 2019 titled \"Dolly Parton, Country Music and Film Star, Deceased\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIt was a darkened, murky sky that hung over Nashville, Tennessee this morning as word broke that music legend Dolly Parton had been pronounced dead at 10 a.m. Her body was discovered by housekeeper and close friend Lupita Del Puta. She was 71 years old. Parton had apparently been suffocated by her own breasts while attempting a head-stand yoga pose. Parton had a bountifully robust career spanning decades, bouncing between hit country songs and film appearances. Her giant personal headlights firmly lit the landscape of American music, jiggling and heaving between soulful ballads and light, funbag pop songs. Parton literally paired up her talents into twin jugs of innovation and emotion, deeply ballooning her outlook into down-home America's most fond mammaries.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nHints that the story isn't real include the fact that Parton's middle name is not Elvira but Rebecca and also the fact it was posted in the category \"Satirical Death Disease and Dismemberment\".\n\nThe housekeeper quoted in the story, \"Lupita Del Puta\", was also quoted in an earlier death hoax involving Chevy Chase that was published on a website run by the same people:\n\nFake News: Chevy Chase NOT Dead at 89, Did NOT Donate Estate to Wall Fund | Lead Stories Did actor and comedian Chevy Chase die and did he leave his estate to a fund to build a border wall? No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes conservativetears.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
