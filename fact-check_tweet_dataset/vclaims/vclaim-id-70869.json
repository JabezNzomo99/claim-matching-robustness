Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., looking somewhat sheepish. Bolded text under the images describes the senators\u2019 views on the age of the Earth and the extinction of the dinosaurs.\n\nAccording to the meme, Rubio \"believes Earth (is) 9,000 years old,\" and \"humans hunted dinosaurs to extinction.\" Paul, the image proclaims, says the Earth is 10,000 years old and believes \"God made dinosaurs disappear to make space for humans.\" The post received about 5,500 likes and was shared more than 4,000 times.\n\nUpon seeing this, we couldn\u2019t resist digging in and finding out just what these two senators believe about the age of the Earth and the demise of the dinosaurs.\n\nIt seems the backing for the claim about Rubio comes from a November 2012 interview with GQ magazine, when Michael Hainey asked, \"How old do you think the Earth is?\"\n\nRubio didn\u2019t directly answer the question, instead saying, \"I'm not a scientist, man. I can tell you what recorded history says, I can tell you what the Bible says, but I think that's a dispute amongst theologians, and I think it has nothing to do with the gross domestic product or economic growth of the United States.\"\n\nHe later called the planet\u2019s age \"one of the great mysteries.\"\n\nThe comment drew criticism around the Internet, sparking a string of opinion pieces from blogs and mainstream news organizations alike. Commentators specifically wondered about Rubio\u2019s answer because of his position on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.\n\nRubio clarified his answer in another interview, this time with Politico on Dec. 5, 2012.\n\n\"First of all, let me tell you about the answer I gave. The answer I gave was actually trying to make the same point the president made a few years ago, and that is there is no scientific debate on the age of the Earth. I mean, it\u2019s established, pretty definitively. It\u2019s 4 and a half\u2026 at least four and half billion years old. I was referring to a theological debate, which is a pretty healthy debate,\" Rubio said.\n\nSo, Rubio didn\u2019t actually peg the age of the Earth at 9,000 years in the GQ interview, and even gave the widely accepted scientific answer in the later interview with Politico.\n\nWe had to go all the way back to 2010 to find a statement from Paul about the age of the Earth. It turned out to be even more vague than Rubio\u2019s answer to GQ.\n\nIn June 2010, Paul gave a speech at a Christian Homeschool Educators of Kentucky meeting, after which he took questions from the audience.\n\nOne audience member asked the then-candidate for Senate, \"Was there a point in life that you became Christian that you recognized? And also, how old is the world?\"\n\nPaul joked at first, saying he was only taking \"easy questions,\" and then described the origins of his faith. He then said he would \"pass\" on the question concerning the age of the Earth.\n\nOther than that, Paul hasn\u2019t made public comments on his opinions about when the Earth came to be.\n\nBeing Liberal\u2019s Facebook post claimed Rubio and Paul believe the Earth is 9,000 and 10,000 years old, respectively. While both men have made vague statements concerning their beliefs about the age of the Earth, neither has publicly cited the figures claimed in the post, and Rubio has even given the widely held scientific answer to the question.\n\nAs for the senators\u2019 views on the fate of the dinosaurs, we\u2019ll take a page from Rubio\u2019s playbook and call it one of the world\u2019s great mysteries, because it doesn\u2019t appear either has said anything in public regarding the issue.\n\nSo there are no public statements to back up the Facebook post\u2019s claim, and Rubio has even said the direct opposite. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
