The latter has taken down the report. Its archive can be accessed here. The article published by Newsd mentions Aarti Singh Tikoo\u2019s name in the byline. She is the Foreign and Strategic Affairs Editor at IANS. The report claimed that Khan while holding a chart of the coronavirus cases in the country said, \u201cSee, it\u2019s right there. The cases seem to be tapering to a flat line.\u201d\n\nIt further stated, \u201cHowever, a political aide Saleem Kheshgi, noticing that the Prime Minister had goofed up, quickly whispered something into his ear. Khan\u2019s mood changed quickly, Pakistan Today reported.\u201d It may be noted that the report cites Pakistan Today.\n\nAlt News found that the report cited by the news agency is a satirical piece. It was published in the satirical section of Pakistani news website Pakistan Today. The satirical section is called \u2018The Dependent\u2019. It appears that the name \u2013 The Dependent \u2013 is inspired by British news outlet The Independent.\n\nThe website clearly mentions the word \u2018satire\u2019 in bold letters in the featured image published along with the article on Khan.\n\nLeaving no room for doubt, the author\u2019s biography at the bottom of the article also has a disclaimer which reads, \u201cThe above piece is a work of satire and does not present itself as the truth.\u201d\n\nTwitter handle Not The Dependent tweeted a screenshot of the IANS article and ridiculed the news agency for not being able to differentiate between a \u201csatire and actual news reports.\u201d\n\nJournalist Aarti Singh Tikoo took to Twitter and apologised for her error by saying that she mistook \u201csatire for serious news.\u201d\n\nA piece of satirical news about Pakistan\u2019s PM Imran Khan reading the coronavirus chart upside down and declaring that the curve has flattened in his country was published as actual news by news agency IANS and subsequently carried by media outlets like Newsd and Outlook. Last year in December, IANS had fallen for satirical news of \u201ccrazy sex run by Irish sheep after drinking viagra\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
