An armed robbery did take place at a small holding but according to the armed response team, the shared pictures are not from the scene.\n\nThe graphic images posted on January 31, 2019 have garnered 2,647 shares, 599 reactions and 247 comments.\n\nThe misleading post regurgitates details of a robbery report originally posted by an armed response team in the area but leads with additional phrases such as \u201cplaasaanval\u201d which means farm attack in Afrikaans.\n\nComments on the post showed that some believed the images were fake, while others were further enraged by the post.\n\nDrift Reaction, the armed response team called to the scene, told AFP that the images were not from the scene.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even the same tiles in the house,\u201d said Terry-Ann Terblanche, liaison officer for Drift Reaction.\n\nThe drift team went through all photos from the evening and confirm that no other pictures were released from that night except for the bloody shoe-print photograph they posted on their Facebook page.\n\n\u201cThe other pics in my possession are gruesome but I will never release them,\u201d she added.\n\n \u201cI am livid, this is such a serious incident. However, people and organisations must stick to facts\u201d, said Terblanche.\n\nThe level of violence against farmers and farm workers is a hotly contested topic in South Africa that often makes international headlines -- see AFP\u2019s report here about the backlash after US President Donald Trump\u2019s tweet on land \u2018seizures\u2019.\n\nA reverse image search of the photos confirmed that they were old photographs, that can be found posted as on an artistic blog Photos from where I\u2019ve been by Rick Powell from 2011.\n\nThe second image in the post is from as early as 2014 according to the TinEye reverse image search under a gallery of images called Gruesome Crime Scene Photos.\n\nSeveral pages and accounts on social media are either claiming to expose the \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa or on the opposite side exposing that it is a myth.", "lang": "en"}
