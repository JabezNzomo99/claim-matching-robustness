Iger said in his statement. \"It\u2019s hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because it isn\u2019t over yet. But we know thousands of people have lost everything and now face the daunting challenge of putting their lives and communities back together, and we\u2019re using our unique resources and reach to help those in need.\"\n\nBelow in bold is how HoustonChronicle-tv.com modified the quote.\n\nHoustonChronicle-tv.com claimed Kim Kardashian said: \"Our hearts go out to everyone in the devastating path of this historic mass shooting.\"\n\nIt adds that the family said: \"It\u2019s hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because people are still recovering from the historic tragedy. But we know several people have been bereaved or victimized and now face the daunting challenge of putting their lives and communities back together fearsomely, and we\u2019re using our unique resources and reach to help those in need.\"\n\nThe post also claims Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian tweeted, \"Las Vegas we are praying for you,\" immediately after announcing the family\u2019s donation.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian on Oct. 2 tweeted condolences after the Las Vegas shooting and said \"My prayers are with you!\" but she did not write the specific words claimed by HoustonChronicle-tv.com.\n\nKim Kardashian on Oct. 2 tweeted: \"Woke up to the most devastating news about Las Vegas. I\u2019m praying for everyone in Las Vegas!\" She also tweeted and retweeted about gun control and violence and about the need for blood donations in Las Vegas.\n\nKim Kardashian on Aug. 29 tweeted that her mom, sisters and her would be donating $500,000 to the American Red Cross and Salvation Army USA to help with Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. But there have been no official reports or tweets from her or her family about donations after the Las Vegas shooting.\n\nHoustonChronicle-tv.com also claimed the Kardashians would be hosting a \"Day of Giving\" on Oct. 7 \"to benefit those impacted by the shooting.\" That also mimic's Disney\u2019s August press release after Hurricane Harvey, which said that on Aug. 31 it would \"host a \u2018Day of Giving\u2019 to benefit those impacted by the hurricane.\"\n\nPolitiFact has labeled HoustonChronicle-tv.com as an imposter site. The website is not affiliated with the actual Houston Chronicle newspaper, whose true website is chron.com, and it is not the website for a TV news station.\n\nHoustonChronicle-tv.com had a similar fake story in August claiming that boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. donated $200 million to Houston for Hurricane Harvey relief.\n\nHoustonChronicle-tv.com fabricated the claim that the Kardashian family donated $1 million to Las Vegas shooting victims.
