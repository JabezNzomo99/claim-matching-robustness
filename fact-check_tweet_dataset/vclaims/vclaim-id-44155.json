It was the first time Twitter had taken such measures against a Trump tweet. The move drew both support and criticism.\n\nA day after the president\u2019s claim, Ellen Weintraub, of the US Federal Election Commission (FEC), posted a 66-tweet fact-checking thread debunking it.\n\n\u201cThere's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud. None,\u201d she said in the thread, which provided exhaustive evidence and reasons why.\n\nWhile accusations of voting fraud are not new, they are gaining renewed traction because of Trump\u2019s tweets and their dissemination on social networking platforms ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election on November 3.\n\nTrump claimed in 2016 and 2019 that voter fraud occurred in New Hampshire. In August last year, Weintraub wrote an open letter demanding that the president provide evidence. None was forthcoming.\n\n\u201cThe American people are ill-served when our leaders put forward unfounded allegations of voter fraud,\u201d the FEC chair wrote at the time.\n\nElection expert Max Feldman, counsel in the Voting Rights and Elections Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, agreed that voting by mail is safe.\n\n\u201cVoting by mail has been a secure part of our election system for many years,\u201d he told AFP in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cThe claims being made now about mail voting are part of a longstanding pattern of falsely claiming that our election systems are infected with voter fraud. While it\u2019s now being applied to mail voting, previously it was applied to in-person voting.\u201d\n\nBoth a Brennan Center analysis and the Voting Rights Project, a 2012 investigation of nationwide election security, said that while absentee ballots are more susceptible to fraud than in-person voting, fraud rates are infinitesimal.\n\n\u201cIt is... more likely for an American to be struck by lightning than to commit mail voting fraud,\u201d the Brennan Center report reads.\n\nFive states -- Oregon, Washington, Utah, Hawaii and Colorado -- have already implemented statewide mail-in ballot systems, and compared to the number of votes cast, issues have been negligible, the Brennan Center analysis says.\n\nOregon, for example, has used vote-by-mail for almost 20 years.\n\nAndrea Chiapella, communications director for the Oregon Secretary of State, said that in 2016, only 22 people in Oregon were found guilty of voting in two states -- accounting for about 0.001 percent of votes cast.\n\nNot all of the votes cast then were absentee, since in-person polls are still an option for Oregonians who prefer it, but security measures are in place for both methods, Chiapella said in an email.\n\nSignatures are required on all ballots and are then evaluated by forensic signature analysts, and paper trails detail every step.\n\n\u201cPaper can\u2019t be hacked,\u201d she said, describing the mail-in voting system as \u201csafe (particularly during a pandemic), secure, convenient and helps to remove barriers to voting for some.\u201d\n\nWashington state, which also uses all-mail voting, shows similarly rare instances of fraud.\n\nOut of more than 3.1 million votes cast, the Washington Office of the Secretary of State referred 142 cases of suspected improper voting in the 2018 general election, according to a May 4, 2020 press release.", "lang": "en"}
