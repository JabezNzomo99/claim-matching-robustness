It is celebrated on June 19 every year, as its name suggests.\n\nA viral image alleges that Obama failed to bring attention to the holiday during his presidency, despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe Daily Caller found at least seven instances of the 44th president commemorating Juneteenth. The White House put out seven statements from Obama regarding the holiday\u2019s observance, starting his first year in office, according to the Obama White House Archives.\n\n\u201cThis moment also serves as a time for reflection and appreciation, and an opportunity for many people to trace their family\u2019s lineage,\u201d Obama\u2019s 2009 statement read. \u201cAfrican Americans helped to build our Nation brick by brick and have contributed to her growth in every way, even when rights and liberties were denied to them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those official statements, the Obama White House tweeted about the holiday several times.

It\u2019s an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of our history, change is possible \u2013 and there is still so much work to do.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
