Facebook users flagged the posts as potentially false.\n\nBoth the headline and story misrepresent a recently announced research initiative that will bring together scholars to examine how the social media giant impacts elections and democracy. Those involved say the endeavor is momentous because it marks the first time Facebook will provide access to its proprietary data to independent researchers, who without such information face \u201csignificant research gaps.\u201d\n\nThe Charles Koch Foundation (not the \u201cCharles and David Koch Foundation,\u201d as the story says) is indeed one of several groups helping to finance that endeavor. The others include the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation; Democracy Fund; the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation; Laura and John Arnold Foundation; and Omidyar Network.\n\nBut Vidya Krishnamurthy, a spokeswoman for the Hewlett Foundation, told FactCheck.org in an email that the story \u201cis false \u2013 the funders will NOT have access to the data.\u201d\n\nKrishnamurthy pointed us to a \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d page about the research on the website of the nonpartisan Social Science Research Council, which will manage the peer-review process and proposal selection for the project, dubbed the Social Data Initiative.\n\nThat page says \u201cfunders are supporting an independent process and independent research; they will not have access to data.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacebook and the funders will have no say in the selection of research proposals or the publication of the research findings,\u201d it adds. \u201cAn independent steering committee of scholars will create the decision-making criteria and research agenda and the SSRC will oversee the peer review process.\u201d\n\nThe council also explains that \u201conly anonymized Facebook data will be shared\u201d with researchers, \u201calthough the specific types of data are to be determined.\u201d Data will come from Facebook and possibly from other sources, such as surveys or focus groups, it says.\n\nGrit Post did not respond to an inquiry from FactCheck.org about the story.\n\nUpdate, April 14: Two days after we published our story, Grit Post responded to our inquiry.\n\n\u201cAfter further review by our editorial team, we have chosen to retract the story,\u201d Grit Post told us in an email, saying it \u201cdid not meet with our editorial standards.\u201d\n\nThe website took down the story and apologized to its readers. \u201cWe apologize for any potential confusion to our readers,\u201d it told us. \u201cGrit Post strives to be as factual and as accurate as possible in its reporting.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network. Facebook has no control over our editorial content.\n\nBenac, Nancy. \u201cWho are the Koch brothers?\u201d Associated Press. 28 Jan 2015.\n\n\u201cHewlett, Knight, Koch foundations, with other funders, will support independent research on Facebook\u2019s role in elections and democracy.\u201d Press release.
