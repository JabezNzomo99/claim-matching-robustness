Making a point on the diversity of Canada\u2019s economic activity, she claimed, \u201cthe oil sands are about two per cent of GDP.\u201d\n\nThe oil sands are a mix of sand, water, clay and bitumen. The sought-after bit is the bitumen, which Natural Resources Canada estimates is around one tenth of the mixture. Separation and upgrading are significant parts of the process to get crude oil from what\u2019s extracted from the three main deposits located in Alberta \u2013 the Athabasca, Cold Lake and Peace River deposits. A production industry has grown up around the oil sands.\n\nHow big is that industry in gross domestic product terms? The data is somewhat imprecise.\n\nStatistics Canada records GDP by industry but not in extreme detail. The oil sands are bundled into non-conventional oil extraction, along with other production from reservoirs like surface shales and other activities like hydraulic fracturing.\n\nThe lack of detail \u201cessentially makes it impossible to actually determine the contribution of the oil sands to Canadian GDP,\u201d said Jennifer Winter, associate director of energy and environmental policy at the University of Calgary\u2019s public policy school. Another level of detail that\u2019s missing is the share of unconventional oil extraction by province, which might hit at a more correct figure for oil sands, since Alberta is home to the large majority of production. But provincial breakdowns show total share of GDP only.\n\nWith this aggregate-number caveat in mind, here is the data for unconventional oil extraction, for the latest month and for the latest year (2011 is the latest year with nominal GDP calculated, important for looking at GDP share):\n\nWarren Mabee, a Queen\u2019s University professor and director of the Queen\u2019s Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy, looked at the data from June 2010 to June 2015, and found the GDP share ranged from 1.5 to 2.3 per cent, with the peak in February 2015.\n\nThe two per cent figure is as accurate as the data allow.\n\nWhat about the related stuff?\n\nStatistics Canada separates out activities like support services for oil extraction, refining, and transportation. That means the related stuff is not captured in the share of GDP attributed to the oil sands.\n\n\u201cA nuanced look at GDP might go beyond direct work in the sector and include other activities, which could push the figure higher,\u201d said Mabee.\n\nFor example, according to the Alberta government, oil sands investment has an indirect impact on six other sectors: Professional services, oilfield services, manufacturing, wholesale trade, financial services, and transportation. The government also links the direct employment from oil sands to job creation in other sectors.\n\nMabee estimated the real figure, if it included indirect jobs and related investment, could push the share of GDP as high as six to seven per cent.\n\nHowever, it would be difficult to attach an exact number to the indirect share of GDP. Just one problem in attempting to do this is that moving from \u2018direct\u2019 to \u2018indirect\u2019 and \u2018induced\u2019 impacts moves into the territory of outsourcing. An accurate figure would require teasing out what gets done by Canadian firms or international ones.\n\nMay\u2019s claim is true. The oil sands directly contribute two per cent of GDP according to Statistics Canada\u2019s (imprecise) data.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Our interpretation of statements, their implied meanings and their context can change a score. We interpreted May\u2019s claim as a point on the diversity of the Canadian economy, and therefore scored the two per cent figure as accurate. We decided there is not enough grounds to say with certainty that she meant divestment in the oil sands would only impact two per cent of GDP. If we did determine this was implied, the claim would be misleading. This was a close call, and in these cases, we give the favourable judgement, as we did in a recent check on Chris Alexander.\n\nSee how we score.", "lang": "en"}
