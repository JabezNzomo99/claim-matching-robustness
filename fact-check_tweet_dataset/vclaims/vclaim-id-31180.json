Just the United States. We\u2019re putting up the bulk of the money. And I\u2019m asking why is that.\u201d\n\n\u2014 in remarks to reporters before the United Nations General Assembly meeting on Tuesday\n\nPresident Trump was responding to reports that he had directed his staff to freeze military aid to Ukraine before he pressed the country\u2019s president to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations involving former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is wrong that other countries do not contribute to Ukraine\u2019s efforts to counteract Russian aggression in recent years.\n\nAid across different countries is difficult to compare, as there is no single publicly accessible source that aggregates all forms of assistance. And some sources of data shows that the European Union has actually provided more aid to Ukraine than the United States.\n\nA 2018 report from Chatham House, a British think tank, finds that the European Union and its member states \u201care the biggest donor in Ukraine.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
