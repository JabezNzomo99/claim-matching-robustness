Barron Trump has been rushed to hospital with severe pneumonia while on holiday in Bedminster, NJ,\" the Aug. 6 post said.\n\nTrump\u2019s youngest son is indeed on vacation with his family at their Bedminster resort, but we found no proof of his purported illness.\n\nThe post claimed Trump had sent a Snapchat photo to his friends captioned, \"Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday.\"\n\nWe traced the image attached to the article to an 841-day old photo on an Instagram search engine called Mulpix. It\u2019s not Barron Trump\u2019s hand.\n\n\"He also tweeted his friends, saying that he was currently \u2018in a wheelchair, connected up to tubes, in a hospital,\u2019 \" the post said.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t find any tweets mentioning a wheelchair or a hospital in the various unofficial Barron Trump Twitter pages.\n\nThe post also cited a nonexistent Fox News report that he was receiving treatment at an unnamed hospital.\n\nIn reality, the post is stealing some real-life events from surrounding a British television show host.\n\nThe host of the show Grand Tour, Jeremy Clarkson, was admitted to a Spanish hospital for pneumonia on Aug. 6, the same day as this fake news story was posted.\n\nA spokesperson for the show said in a statement that Clarkson \"was admitted to hospital on Friday morning during a family holiday in Spain.\"\n\nClarkson posted a photo on Instagram of his arm which he captioned, \"Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday.\"\n\nHe also said he was in \"in a wheelchair, connected up to tubes, in a hospital\" in a tweet.\n\nThat\u2019s more than enough to seal the fate of the claim that Barron Trump was rushed to hospital with severe pneumonia. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
