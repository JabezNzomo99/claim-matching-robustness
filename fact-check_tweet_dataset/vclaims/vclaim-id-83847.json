The juxtaposition is misleading: the photos were taken in different places two years apart.\n\nIn theory, the \u201cten year challenge\u201d invites social media users to publish two photos of themselves side by side, with a ten year difference. In this variation on the challenge, posted on January 14, the juxtaposition with the caption \u201c#tenyearchallenge\u201d is misleading.\n\nThe image is meant as a statement on the scientifically proven impact of global warming on glaciers. However, neither the original post nor those who shared it specify that the two photos were not taken in the same place or ten years apart.\n\nNicolas Bilodeau, the Twitter user who posted the image, told AFP that he wanted to show \u201cother things that changed in ten years and could provoke reactions.\u201d The communications specialist from Quebec added that he originally wanted \u201creal images of real glaciers from 2019 and 2009, but the research too complicated so I picked two glaciers that could quickly show that there were changes in ten years,\u201d a choice he justified as \u201cartistic license\u201d.\n\nThe photo on the left was taken by NASA scientist Jeremy Harbeck. Dated November 5, 2016, the frame shows the Getz Ice Shelf, in Western Antarctica. Here it is on NASA\u2019s website.\n\nThe photo on the right shows the remains of an Arctic ocean ice shelf; it was taken in August 2018 by National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) scientist Julienne Stroeve. Here it is on the website.\n\nThe impact of climate change on glacial ice is real.\n\nAs this AFP story from December 2, 2018 explains, \u201c Arctic sea ice cover is declining at a rate of more than 13 percent per decade, relative to the 1981-2010 average.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the yearly melting rate of ice in Antarctica is now faster than ever, about six times faster than forty years ago, which leads to an ever higher rise of global ocean levels, scientists warned on Monday. By their estimations, Antarctica lost on average 40 billion tons of glacial mass per year between 1979 and 1990. This number rose to 252 billion tons per year between 2009 and 2017.", "lang": "en"}
