This is just for your knowledge so you can understand the truth.\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post misleading. During the Doklam crisis of June-August 2017, Rahul Gandhi had indeed tweeted that he met the Chinese ambassador, but the pictures posted along with the viral claim are not related to the meeting. One of the images is from 2018, several months after the stand-off, while the other is from April 2017, two months before tension erupted.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here.\n\n\n\nMultiple users have shared this post on Facebook.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found details about the two pictures.\n\nThis image was tweeted by Rahul Gandhi on January 5, 2018. Gandhi wrote, \"Met with the CPC Delegation led by Mr Meng Xiangfeng, member of the CPC Central Committee for a meaningful exchange of views.\"\n\nSeveral news websites had reported about the meeting.\n\nThis image has been available on the Chinese embassy website since April 21, 2017. It was taken a day before at the \"Chinese Diaoyutai Food Festival\" at Taj Palace Hotel.\n\n\n\nAfter initial denials from several Congress leaders, Rahul Gandhi himself tweeted on July 10, 2017, confirming that he had indeed met the Chinese ambassador.\n\nRahul tweeted, \"It is my job to be informed on critical issues. I met the Chinese Ambassador, Ex-NSA, Congress leaders from NE & the Bhutanese Ambassador\". This had created a political storm at the time and was covered by mainstream media.\n\nBut, none of the two viral pictures have any relation to the Doklam stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops.", "lang": "en"}
