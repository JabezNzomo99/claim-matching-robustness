And Democrats also continue to assert this, as evidenced by the statement above by Sanders, who is considering run for Democratic presidential nomination. The all-but-certain campaign of former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton is also expected to make gender inequality a key theme.\n\nBut the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the gap is 18 cents when looking at weekly wages. The gap is even smaller when you look at hourly wages \u2014 13 cents \u2014 but then not every wage earner is paid on an hourly basis, so that statistic excludes salaried workers.\n\nAnnual wage figures do not take into account the fact that teachers \u2014 many of whom are women \u2014 have a primary job that fills nine months out of the year. The weekly wage is more of an apples-to-apples comparison, but it does not include as many income categories. (Still, we should note that the wage gap likely would increase if part-time workers were included in the statistics, as is done in Canada.)\n\nJune O\u2019Neill, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who has been a critic of the 77-cent statistic, has noted that the wage gap is affected by a number of factors, including that the average woman has less work experience than the average man and that more of the weeks worked by women are part-time rather than full-time. Women also tend to leave the workforce for periods to raise children, seek jobs that may have more flexible hours but lower pay, and choose careers that tend to have lower pay.\n\nIn 2011, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis surveyed economic literature and concluded that \u201cresearch suggests that the actual gender wage gap (when female workers are compared with male workers who have similar characteristics) is much lower than the raw wage gap.\u201d They noted that women may prefer to accept jobs with lower wages but greater benefits (more flexible parental leave) so excluding such fringe benefits from the calculations will exaggerate the wage disparity. One survey, prepared for the Labor Department by the CONSAD Research Corp. during the George W. Bush administration, concluded that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap dwindled, to about 5 cents on the dollar.\n\nWe do not want to suggest there is no pay gap; in fact, just about every example above reported that there was some sort of gap in wages. A report by the American Association of University Women found that, after accounting for a variety of factors, including college major and occupation, there was an unexplained 7 percent gap one year after graduation. The gap then grew to 12 percent after 10 years.\n\nMoreover, there is certainly a case to be made that women should be encouraged to enter lucrative fields now dominated by men. That might help mitigating another aspect of a pay gap \u2014 the long-term impact of even slightly lower wages. A 2004 study for the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, by Stephen J. Rose and Heidi I. Hartmann, calculated that across 15 years, prime age women earned just 38 percent of what prime age men earned \u2013 an apparent wage gap of 62 percent.\n\nIn a town hall meeting Oct. 3, 2014, the president acknowledged some of this nuance: \u201cWomen on average make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. What folks will tell you sometimes is you can\u2019t really compare the situation, because a lot of women, by choice, end up working less when they have kids, decide to stay home, and so it\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d He went on to note that there are still examples of women getting paid less than men for \u201cdoing the exact same job.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the case, but it does not excuse a broad-brush approach that relies so much on a single factoid. Unless women stop taking three to four months off from work after having a child, and start abandoning careers in childhood education for naval architecture, a large gap in wages will almost certainly persist.", "lang": "en"}
