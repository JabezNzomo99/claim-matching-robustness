As of writing, it has garnered more than 22,000 reactions, 29,000 comments, and 24,000 shares.\n\nAt least 5 other Facebook pages, including Definitely Filipino, Kicker Daily News, and Brigada News San Carlos posted similar claims \u2013 some of which, including I Love Antique's, are credited to tabloid website Abante.\n\nAbante\u2019s headline reads, \u201cHindi lahat Katoliko! Krus sa mga ospital pinapatanggal,\u201d but its lead indicates that Marcoleta wants to make hanging crucifixes in hospital rooms optional. (Not all are Catholics! Crucifixes in hospitals to be removed.)\n\nRappler reached out to I Love Antique, but it stood by Abante as its source.\n\nThe facts: Marcoleta authored House Bill 4633 or the Neutrality of Religion in Health Care Institutions bill, which proposes that \"the hanging of religious mementos, such as crucifixes, in hospital suites [will be] optional.\"\n\nUnder the bill, patients would have the right to decide whether the room or suite assigned to them should bear religious mementos.\n\nWhile Marcoleta indeed wrote in his explanatory note that he thinks crucifixes are the symbol of Catholicism and the presence of crucifixes in \u201cmany local hospital suites\u201d could make a non-Catholic patient uncomfortable, he proposed that the hanging of such mementos should be \u201ca matter of option.\u201d\n\nWhile there are opinion articles on PhilStar.com and Daily Tribune on Marcoleta\u2019s bill, no credible news sites reported what has been attributed to Marcoleta.", "lang": "en"}
