Richardson pointed to problems with the doomed Columbia River Crossing bridge project and the disastrous rollout of Cover Oregon, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\nRichardson, in assessing Kitzhaber\u2019s record in office, singled out failures of the state\u2019s educational system.\n\n\"We are 49th in the nation for our graduation rate,\" he said.\n\nIs Oregon nearly at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to U.S. high school graduation rates? PolitiFact Oregon checked.\n\nWe emailed the Richardson campaign, which sent us a link to a Feb. 7, 2014, article by Betsy Hammond, the state education reporter for The Oregonian. The article\u2019s headline: \"Oregon\u2019s high school graduation rate second-worst in nation.\"\n\nThe results, from the high school class of 2012, taken from the 2011-12 school year, showed Oregon\u2019s rate above only Nevada\u2019s when it came to our \"regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate\"; that is, the percentage of students who entered the ninth grade in 2008-09 and graduated on time four years later in June 2012.\n\nThe numbers came from the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s second-ever compilation of comparable state-by-state graduation rates.\n\nFor 2012, the numbers show, Nevada ranked dead last, at 63 percent, with Oregon next-worst, at 68 percent.\n\nIowa topped the list, with an 89 percent four-year graduation rate.But three states, Idaho, Kentucky and Oklahoma, did not submit their rates, saying they lacked the ability to track all students. So Oregon was actually No. 46 out of 47 states, not No. 49. If the three other states had submitted their rates, it\u2019s conceivable that Oregon could have climbed anywhere from one to three spots higher.\n\nFor the class of 2011, Oregon\u2019s graduation was fourth-worst among the same 47 states, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics. By in 2011-12, New Mexico and Georgia surged ahead, leaving the Beaver State a step from the basement.\n\nWe called Crystal Greene, communications director for the Oregon Department of Education, who said that while the four-year rate is the gold standard, other measures exist.\n\nThose include five-year programs that allow students to remain enrolled in high school while attending community colleges, \"modified\" diplomas for special education students, diplomas awarded to adults, and GEDs. Including students who received modified diplomas and GEDs, she said, takes Oregon\u2019s \"completer rate\" to 80 percent.\n\nBut, she said, official state reports on graduation rates don\u2019t include those numbers. The Oregonian has also found that outcomes for students who earn GEDs, in particular, are far worse than those for high school graduates, meaning the credentials are far from equivalent.\n\nStill, she acknowledged that the four-year rate -- considered by both state and federal education officials as the correct way to measure graduation rates nationally -- places Oregon near the bottom.\n\nState Rep. Dennis Richardson, in taking on Gov. John Kitzhaber, stated during a recent debate that Oregon ranks 49th in high school graduation rates.\n\nHe based the number on a news story that looked at state-by-state numbers for the 2011-12 school year from the U.S. Department of Education. The story\u2019s headline said Oregon had the nation\u2019s \"second-worst\" rate.\n\nThat\u2019s correct. But because only 47 states submitted data, it\u2019s incorrect to say Oregon came in 49th.\n\nRichardson\u2019s claim is close but needs clarification. We rate the claim Mostly True.\n\nThoughts on this PolitiFact Oregon piece? Go to OregonLive.com/politics to leave your comments.", "lang": "en"}
