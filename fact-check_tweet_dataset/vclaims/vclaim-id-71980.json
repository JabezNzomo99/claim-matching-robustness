The post stated that nearly 4 million women had fallen into poverty since Obama was elected in 2008.\n\nThe campaign also was drawing on similar public comments by U.S. Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, though both McConnell and Cruz used slightly smaller estimates of 3.7 million, Dickey said.\n\nWe reached out to the staff of both senators and heard back immediately from Don Stewart from McConnell\u2019s office. Stewart pointed us to data from the U.S. Census Bureau (table 7 ) showing that there were 22.131 million females living below the poverty line in 2008, the year President Obama was elected, and 25.840 million in poverty in 2012.\n\nThat is an increase of 3.7 million (over five years, not six as Perdue said).\n\nBut that data counts all females -- including children -- which is not what most people think of or how Merriam-Webster defines women.\n\nAmong women 18 and over - the ones in those jobs Perdue was discussing in the debate - the poverty rate went up by 2.8 million between 2008 and 2013, according to Census figures.\n\nLooking at the data starting in 2009, when Obama took office and could affect policy, the increase drops to 1.5 million, Census data show.\n\nTwo facts missing from those numbers further complicate the data, according to William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.\n\nOne: the number of all women increased in those periods due to population growth. That \"accounts for most of the increase in poverty in women over either the 2008-2013 or 2009-2013,\" Frey said.\n\nTwo: The Great Recession ticked up the poverty rate for everyone, not just women, between 2010 and 2012. Last year, the poverty rate went down overall for the first time since 2006, before Obama took office.\n\nFor working-age women, those between 18 and 64, there was a rise in the poverty among adult women of about 991,000 between 2009 and 2013. The Census Bureau calls those figures \" \"\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nPerdue last week said Michelle Nunn \"supports the economic policies of this administration, one that put 4 million women in poverty in six years.\"\n\nHe bases it, in part, on U.S. Census Bureau data first collected in 2008, when Obama wasn\u2019t even in office.\n\nThe Census Bureau data shows 3.7 million more females in poverty in 2012 than in 2008. But when you talk just about women -- adult females over 18 -- the increase is 2.8 million. That\u2019s far too big an increase but also far too far from 4 million to be called accurate.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
