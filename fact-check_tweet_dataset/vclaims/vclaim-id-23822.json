In the tweet, it was written, \u201cI\n\n know all India disappointed with us after this semi and trolling about my retirement. But this is not the right time to leave my team like this. Fans, no need to worry, I will play\n\n 2020 ICC T20 World Cup in Aus. Keep Supporting\u201d. In the tweet, there is also an\n\n Instagram link- \u2018instagram.com/p/BrhgZDdlQTe/\u2019. Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of\n\n the tweet seen in the video posted.\n\nClaim: MS Dhoni has tweeted after India\u2019s Semi-Final loss in the World Cup 2019 that\n\n he will not retire and will be playing for India in the T20 WC in 2020.. Fact: MS Dhoni hasn\u2019t tweeted recently. His last tweet was on May 6, 2019. So,\n\n the tweet seen in the video is a morphed one. Hence, the claim made in the post\n\n is FALSE.\n\nWhen checked on MS Dhoni\u2019s Twitter account regarding the claim made in the post, it was found that he hasn\u2019t tweeted recently. He was found to have last tweeted on May 6, 2019. In that tweet, he wrote, \u201cUse your Power\u201d and included an Instagram link. But, India has played its World Cup 2019 Semi-Finals with New Zealand on July 9, 2019. So, the tweet seen in the video is a photoshopped one.\n\nWhen one opens the Instagram link seen in the tweet, a video was found which was uploaded on December 18, 2018. With this information, when performed Twitter Advanced Search, the original tweet was found. This December 18, 2018 tweet was edited and is being circulated with a false narrative. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, Dhoni hasn\u2019t tweeted after India\u2019s WC Semi-Final loss that he will not retire and will be playing for the T20 WC in 2020.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
