Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\nThe MSNBC host for years has criticized the rising Republican star and libertarian during her evening talk show. So when Maddow went on a rant about a recent stump speech Paul gave on behalf of Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, at first it seemed like business as usual.\n\nDuring remarks Oct. 28 at Liberty University, -- a sensitive topic in Virginia, where until 1979 it was legal to sterilize the mentally disabled -- when he brought up the 1997 sci-fi thriller Gattaca, starring Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law.\n\nIt\u2019s at that point Maddow said he got into trouble, claiming Paul\u2019s comments about the movie were \"totally ripped off of Wikipedia.\"\n\n\"Rand Paul wants to be president,\" she added. \"But right now he\u2019s just lifting whole sections of this Wikipedia entry hoping that nobody\u2019s going to notice and he can call it his speech.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time a politician has of (ahem) borrowing his words from someone else. But from Wikipedia? It seemed too sophomoric a slipup for someone like Paul, who filibustered for 13 hours straight on the Senate floor earlier this year without any accusations of lifting his remarks.\n\nIt\u2019s true the campaign trail isn\u2019t the classroom, where copying and pasting from secondary sources is a fatal sin. But Paul is a major political player in Washington, and is considering a run for president in 2016 . So a bold accusation like Maddow\u2019s raised our eyebrow.\n\nPaul shrugged it off as a phony controversy ignited by Maddow, who has been \"spreading hate on me for about three years now.\"\n\n\"This is really about information and attacks coming from haters,\" Paul said.\n\nWe\u2019re more than familiar with the \"haters gonna hate\" defense, just as we fact-checkers know what it\u2019s like to be on the receiving end of Maddow\u2019s scorn . But it was a serious enough claim that we decided to check it out anyway.\n\nWe wanted to review the Gattaca Wikipedia page for ourselves. Any of the site\u2019s users can edit entries as they see fit, meaning pages\u2019 content changes frequently.\n\nBut the pages\u2019 edit histories are public, too, making it clear who added or changed which information and when. At first, we thought it might be possible that a reader edited the movie\u2019s Wikipedia entry to match Paul\u2019s speech after-the-fact. However, the shows no change to the page between Sept. 25 and Oct. 29, the day after he stumped for Cuccinelli.\n\nLet\u2019s check several examples of Paul\u2019s words against the of the page:\n\u2022 \"In the not-too-distant future, eugenics is common and DNA plays a primary role in determining your social class.\"\n\nThe Wikipedia entry reads, \"In \u2018the not-too-distant future\u2019, liberal eugenics is common and DNA plays the primary role in determining social class.\" That looks nearly identical.\n\u2022 \"Due to frequent screenings, Vincent faces genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way to achieve his dream of becoming an astronaut, is he has to become what\u2019s called a \u2018borrowed ladder.\u2019 \"\n\nWikipedia: \"Due to frequent screening, Vincent faces genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way he can achieve his dream of becoming an astronaut is to become a \u2018borrowed ladder\u2019, a person who impersonates a \u2018valid\u2019 with a superior genetic profile.\" That too is mostly identical, with a brief addition at the end.\n\u2022 \"He assumes the identity of Jerome Morrow, a world-class swimming star with a genetic profile said to be \u2018secondary to none\u2019 but he\u2019s been paralyzed in a car accident.\"\n\nWikipedia: \"He assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow, a former swimming star with a genetic profile \u2018second to none\u2019, who had been injured in a car accident, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.\" Some of the wording here is different, but the sentence structure is strikingly identical.\n\u2022 \"Jerome buys his identity -- uses his DNA, his blood, his hair, his tissue, his urine -- to pass the screenings.\"\n\nWikipedia: \"Vincent \u2018buys\u2019 Jerome's identity and uses his 'valid' DNA in blood, hair, tissue, and urine samples to pass screening.\" Almost identical, but Paul mixed up the character names.\n\nSensing a pattern? So are we.\n\nPaul was adamant there was no wrongdoing. , a news and pop culture network aimed at young Hispanics, Paul insisted \"nothing we said was not given attribution to where it came from\" and the matter was a \"disagreement on how you footnote things.\"\n\n\"We borrowed the plot lines from Gattaca. It\u2019s a movie,\" Paul told Fusion. \"I gave credit to the people who wrote the movie.\"\n\nIn a statement to PolitiFact on Nov. 1, his office added: \"While Sen. Paul doesn\u2019t believe that this is the normal standard for speeches, going forward he will be more cautious in presenting and attributing sources.\"\n\nPaul\u2019s excuse doesn\u2019t hold water, said Bob Lehrman, author of The Political Speechwriter\u2019s Companion and a former speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore.\n\n\"When I looked at the size of language and how closely he took it, I thought that was really inappropriate, and his defense of it shows he\u2019s either desperate to shield something or he doesn\u2019t understand plagiarism,\" he said.\n\nLehrman, who also teaches a speech writing class at American University, says he tells his students lifting \"even one distinctive phrase or sentence is plagiarism and is grounds for turning you in. It is absolutely inappropropriate.\"\n\nIt\u2019s happened before. Then-Sen. Barack Obama was campaigning for president in 2008 when he was caught using a line uttered previously by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. It turned out to be a blip in the race.\n\n\"People do it,\" Lehrman said. \"That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right thing, and it\u2019s not the right thing to take language and just use it in a speech without attributing it.\"\n\nPaul\u2019s speech is a more serious offense than that of Obama\u2019s 2008 gaffe, said Jonathan Bailey, the creator of Plagiarism Today, an online resource for writers to combat plagiarism. Obama forgot an attribution, one he remembered several other times, and acknowledged the error.\n\n\"What gets me is not so much what happened,\" Bailey said. \"What happened by itself is fairly mundane. All Paul had to do was apologize.\"\n\nBut Paul claiming he credited the movie exacerbated his problem, since the movie itself wasn\u2019t what he lifted from.\n\n\"A little transparency, a little openness about what happened and why it\u2019s not going to happen again would also go a long way,\" he said.\n\nWe\u2019ll leave it to the prognosticators to determine how much impact Paul\u2019s blunder will have on his political prospects, but the facts are pretty clear on this one. Maddow was dead on; Paul recited Gattaca\u2019s Wikipedia page nearly word-for-word. We rate her statement True.", "lang": "en"}
