(The relevant portion of this interview, which can be heard here, starts at 3:10.)\n\nInterviewer Rachel Martin asks Clinton about whether she believes that sexism played a role in her defeat to Donald Trump, and if she thinks this might be because Clinton failed to inspire them. During her response to this question, Clinton recounts a conversation with Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg:\n\nNPR\u2019s audio of the interview skips to another question at this point, but the transcript continues with Clinton observing:\n\nAnd we saw a lot of that during the primaries from Sanders supporters, really quite vile attacks online against women who spoke out for me, as I say, one of my biggest support groups, Pantsuit Nation, literally had to become a private site because there was so much sexism directed their way. So I knew going in that this would be a hurdle for me.\n\nEarlier in the interview, Clinton noted: \u201cI didn\u2019t win the vote of white women.\u201d\n\nThe quote that spread widely on Facebook should not be attributed to Hillary Clinton, because she didn\u2019t say those exact words and was quoting someone else to begin with \u2014 and she pointedly did not use the word \u201ccaved\u201d.\n\nNeither did Clinton speak in such absolute terms about the dynamics at play among female voters or state that pressure from men was a motivating factor for all women who voted for Donald Trump, although she also did not offer any alternative explanations for why she lost among white women in particular.\n\nIn March 2018, Clinton made similar comments during an event in India. Asked why 52 percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump, and not her in 2016, Clinton pointed out a historical pattern of decline in Democratic voting among white women.\n\nHowever, she also suggested once again that pressure from men was a motivating factor for some married white women in voting for Trump:, especially after former FBI Director James Comey made a bombshell announcement about the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private server, days before the election: (Relevant section of video starts at 40:00.)\n\nPart of that [decline] is an identification with the Republican party, and a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son \u2014 whoever \u2014 believes you should. What happened in my election is I was on the way to winning white women until [James Comey] dropped that very ill-advised letter on October the 28th, and my numbers just went down\u2026 All of a sudden, white women who were going to vote for me and frankly standing up to the men in their lives and the men in their workplaces, were being told \u201cShe\u2019s going to jail, you don\u2019t want to vote for her. That\u2019d be terrible, you can\u2019t vote for that.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Clinton did not actually say that women \u201ccaved in\u201d to pressure from men, and this time, she specifically framed her remarks around married white women, not all women, as well as offering historical context for the Democratic party\u2019s declining vote share among the white, female electorate.", "lang": "en"}
