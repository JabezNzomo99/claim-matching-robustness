A fact-check, however, reveals that each of these images is old.\n\nA reverse-image search on Google revealed that this photograph is five years old. While the same image has been used across the years \u2013 2015, 2017, 2018 \u2013 we found its earliest appearance in an August 28, 2014 article on the website Asian Tribune.\n\nRecently, several social media users also shared a video showing the Niagara Falls lit up in the tricolour.\n\nThis video was found to be two years old. Alt News traced the same clip uploaded on YouTube on August 16, 2017.\n\nThis image was tweeted by the official handle of the Empire State Building on August 15, 2018.\n\nWhile the image shared by Kapoor is old, the official Twitter handle of the Consulate General of India had posted a video showing the Empire State Building lit up on the 73rd Independence Day.\n\nThe photograph of tricolour-lit Burj Khalifa was traced back to 2017. Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan was among those who had shared the image two years ago.\n\nAlthough the photograph shared by Rishi Kapoor is unrelated to this year\u2019s I-Day celebrations, the tallest building in the world was indeed lit up in the colours of the Indian flag on the 73rd independence day.\n\nIn January this year, digitally created photographs of several international monuments, like the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Statue of Liberty, lit up in the colours of the Indian flag were viral.", "lang": "en"}
