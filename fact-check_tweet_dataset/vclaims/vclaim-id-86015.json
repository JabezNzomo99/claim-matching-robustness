The missing context that led to PolitiFact\u2019s ruling is that Cuccinelli, as a state lawmaker, did not single out women when he proposed laws regarding divorce. (Update: On Sept. 26, PolitiFact Virginia changed its ruling to \u201chalf true.\u201d)\n\nBut there\u2019s other, perhaps more important, context as well\u2014notably that Cuccinelli\u2019s proposals were part of the legislative agenda of so-called father\u2019s rights groups. Cuccinelli could not offer a law that specifically targeted women, but the practical effect of his proposals is that mothers would be shortchanged compared to current law.\n\nAs detailed in August by Ben Pershing of The Washington Post, Cuccinelli has a close relationship with the fathers\u2019 rights movement, which is made up of activists who argue that the legal system does not treat men fairly in divorce and custody cases. That is not Cuccinelli\u2019s belief, his campaign has said, but Pershing documented how Cuccinelli championed a number of bills that had won the strong support of such groups.\n\nA particular target of Cuccinelli is no-fault divorce, which he acknowledges is a political hot potato, as shown in this video clip from a speech he made to Virginia Christian Alliance in 2011. \u201cI\u2019ve done that by trying to do things like end no-fault divorce, take care of children, actually prioritize children when parents are having conflict in the law,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I tell you what, you want politically uncomfortable, that\u2019s a very uncomfortable place to be.\u201d\n\nUnder Virginia\u2019s current law, there\u2019s no such thing as a quickie divorce. A couple seeking a no-fault divorce must separate for at least year before they can be granted one. Many couples find that route preferable to arguing over\u2013and proving\u2013such claims as adultery, even if that is the cause of the break-up.\n\nIn 2008, as a state senator, Cuccinelli proposed to make it impossible, in marriages with minor children, for a spouse to file for divorce under this procedure if the other spouse filed a written objection. As Cuccinelli put it in a 2008 speech: \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is essentially repeal no-fault divorce when there are children involved.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s ad, designed to take advantage of a gender gap in the race, emphasized the impact of this shift from the perspective of the woman. For instance, here\u2019s what the state of Virginia says about proving adultery: \u201cProving adultery is very fact-specific. The evidence must be strict, satisfactory and conclusive that the other spouse did in fact engage in sexual relations with another person.\u201d So if a no-fault divorce is not available, that\u2019s the burden that a woman wanting a divorce would need to climb if Cuccinelli\u2019s proposal had become law.\n\n\u201cWe must strictly enforce court orders related to custody and make sure custody decisions are based on the best interest of children. Studies show that the dissolution of marriage has long term negative impacts on children and those marriages that last for five years are much more likely to go the distance. For this reason, the state has an interest in marital preservation. I support family law reform that establishes mutual consent divorce and requires counseling where children are involved, unless abuse is involved.\u201d\n\nAs a state senator in 2005, Cuccinelli offered a bill that would have made it so parents initiating a no-fault divorce could have that action counted against them \u201cwhen deciding custody and visitation.\u201d The measure never came to a vote, but Cuccinelli won praise from Stephen Baskerville, then-president of the American Coalition for Fathers and Children, for fighting against the no-fault divorce \u201cepidemic.\u201d Cuccinelli also was the lone Senate vote against legislation to increase child support payments by tying them more closely to inflation. The 2006 measure passed 39-1, but stalled in the Virginia House of Delegates. Baskerville said the bill was an attempt to \u201crailroad through higher child support, though it already is at punitive levels.\u201d\n\nJust as Cuccinelli was an outlier with his vote on increasing child support payments, his bills on marriage and child custody did not fare well during the legislative process. Virginia records show that both died in committee almost as soon as they were submitted.\n\nAs we said, context is important. The fact that Cuccinelli did not directly single out women in his legislation makes it difficult to award a rare \u201cGeppetto Checkmark,\u201d especially for an attack ad. Still, given the context in which Cuccinelli offered this bill\u2014with the support of the father\u2019s rights movement\u2013neither does it quite merit Pinocchios. But we don\u2019t give \u00bd Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
