Will you allow your children to get near this worthless person?)\"\n\nOther posts with the same graphic had the caption, \"Rally pa more (That's what you get for joining rallies.)\"\n\nPosts containing this claim were flagged by Facebook Claim Check, a tool that detects posts with potentially false information. The claim was also emailed by a reader to Rappler for verification.\n\nThe facts: Elago denied that she tested positive for the virus, saying she did not experience any symptoms after self-quarantine and thus had no reason to get tested.\n\nHer post was accompanied by a video where she explained her situation. \"Nang matapos ko ang mandatory self-quarantine, wala naman po akong sintomas. Kaya sa ilalim ng kasalukuyang guidelines, wala pong dahilan upang ako ay magpa-test,\" she said. (READ: When should you get tested for coronavirus?)\n\nRappler also reached out to Ka Onyok's page to ask for its source, but it did not respond. The page was deactivated the next day.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
