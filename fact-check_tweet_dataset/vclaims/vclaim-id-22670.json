The Mediametrics.ru analysis showed that the article was trending in the Russian social networks for the 24 hours following its publication, holding a sixth position in the intersection of \u201ccountries\u201d \u201csocial networks\u201d \u201cregions\u201d and \u201c24 hours.\" This was after the inauguration date had been announced:\n\n\u200bThe article was later shared on a website called bbcccnn.org, which is followed by nearly 1.75 million people on Facebook. The article received a strong level of interaction on the popular social media platform.\n\nThe article\u2019s claim, however, is false.\n\nThe following day, the Ukrainian parliament set Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration to be held at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on May 20.\n\nZelenskiy had previously sought a May inauguration, which could give him a mandate to dissolve parliament and call for a snap election.\n\nAt the time of publication, Elise Journal had not issued a retraction or an update or taken down the story.\n\nMany, if not most, of the stories posted under the author section for Kavlenko are of an alarmist nature, accusing Poroshenko of multiple offenses, including theft, corruption and genocide.\n\u2022 This is genocide. Over 5 years, 2.7 million pensioners have been destroyed in Ukraine. Shocking figures of Poroshenko's 5 years (PHOTOS)\n\u2022 Journalist: \u201cIf our servicemen learn about this information, they will tear it to pieces\u201d (PHOTO)\n\u2022 It\u2019s begun! Poroshenko and members of his group are revealed. Criminal cases are initiated. What's happening?

It ostensibly operates out of Gunzenhausen, Germany, but in fact is registered to a home on Nasypnaya Street on Uzhhorod, Ukraine.\n\nThe home in question is close to a Ukrainian National Guard facility.\n\nPolygraph.info sought more information and comment from the Elise Journal, at it\u2019s website but had not received a response at the time of publication.\n\nWhile the above story appears to not have been widely republished, it fits into a broader Russian-state media narrative that sought to discredit Ukraine\u2019s March 31 presidential election.\n\nFor example, Polygraph.info has previously reported that Russian state TV claimed Poroshenko would falsify the election to remain in power.\n\nThat message was broadcast widely across numerous Russian state media platforms.\n\nUltimately, Zelensky won the second round of the presidential poll with 73% of the vote, having bested Poroshenko 30% to 16% during the first round of voting.", "lang": "en"}
