The video is being shared to show that Muslims have disobeyed the lockdown orders and gathered in large numbers in old city. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Situation in the old city (Hyderabad) today despite the lockdown. Fact: The video is an old one. It was not taken during the current lockdown. Also, today\u2019s Friday prayer at Mecca Masjid was conducted with only a few members. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Google Reverse Image Search, a similar video was found in the search results. The video was uploaded on 20 December 2019 and had the title \u2013 \u2018Protests against #CAA_#NRC near Charminar, Makkah Masjid, Hyderabad after Juma prayer\u2019. So, the video was not taken during the current lockdown.\n\nAlso, no such protest was held in the old city today. Today\u2019s Friday prayer at Mecca Masjid was conducted with only a few members to avoid the spread of COVID-19. People were asked to offer prayers from their respective homes. The videos related to today\u2019s situation in the old city can be watched here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, an old protest video falsely shared as \u2018Situation in the old city (Hyderabad) today\u2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
