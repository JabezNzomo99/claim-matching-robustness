After Jamia Nagar, protesters in Seelampur clashed with policemen and damaged vehicles, including a school bus.\n\nAnd now, a video of a moving bus with shattered windows, wailing children and adults reassuring them is spreading like wildfire on social media, linking it to Tuesday\u2019s violence in Seelampur.\n\nFacebook user Ram Navmi posted the video along with a claim in Hindi that translates to, It is being clearly seen in Seelampur, the fear of stone-pelters among school-going kids. Stone-pelters did not even spare a bus filled with children.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is from last year and has nothing to do with anti-CAA protests in Seelampur. The school bus was attacked in Gurugram during a protest against the release of the movie Padmaavat\u2019.\n\nThe viral video shows terrified students and adults ducking and cowering in fear as the bus keeps moving with shattered window glasses.\n\nMany Facebook and Twitter users have shared the video with similar claims.\n\nTo check the veracity of the video, we selected a few frames and did a reverse search. This led us to news articles by NDTV and tweets saying that the video is from January 24, 2018.\n\nAccording to news reports, organisations such as Karni Sena were protesting the release of Padmaavat\u2019 for wrongful portrayal of history. In Gurugram, protesters threw stones at a school bus, smashing its windows. School kids who were on the bus had started crying in panic. However, nobody was injured. The video, shot from inside the bus, had gone viral at that time.\n\nTherefore, it can be said that the viral video of a school bus being attacked by protestors is from 2018 and has nothing to with anti-CAA protests in Delhi\u2019s Seelampur.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: No, this is not ABVP man in the garb of Delhi police\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: This little girl was not injured in stone pelting on trains in India", "lang": "en"}
