Omar\u2019s remarks\n\nHer remarks were part of a larger point about anti-Muslim discrimination and came after she listed some examples. A longer look at what she said: \u201cFor far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d We leave it for readers to decide whether Omar was clear enough on terrorism.\n\n2. Does the Walton family earn more in a minute than Walmart workers do in a year?\n\n4. What happened in the White House between Democrats and Trump?\n\nTrump met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer over the border wall in January, but things apparently went off the rails. Did Trump \u201cslam\u201d the table, and did Pelosi reject border security? We investigated. Everyone at this meeting was biased in some way, so no Pinocchios were given, but there were a few conclusions we could draw nevertheless.\n\n5. What\u2019s actually in the Green New Deal?\n\nBut the size of a refund tells you nothing about a person\u2019s tax bill. We gave Four Pinocchios to Harris because she linked these facts deceptively and without context, making it appear as though the smaller tax refunds were evidence of a tax hike on the middle class. In reality, the size of a tax refund reflects nothing about the size of a tax cut or tax increase \u2014 and at least in 2018, the vast majority of middle-class Americans can expect to pay less in taxes as a result of the Trump tax law.\n\n8. What Attorney General Barr said vs. what the Mueller report said\n\n9. Stephen Miller\u2019s claim that \u2018thousands of Americans die year after year\u2019 from illegal immigration\n\n10. Planned Parenthood\u2019s false stat: \u2018Thousands\u2019 of women died every year before Roe\n\nPlanned Parenthood referred us to a policy statement from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG): \u201cIt is estimated that before 1973, 1.2 million U.S. women resorted to illegal abortion each year and that unsafe abortions caused as many as 5,000 annual deaths.\u201d Where does that estimate come from? ACOG sent us several studies, but none of them included the 5,000 estimate. To support Wen\u2019s claim, Planned Parenthood then sent us citations that included a study from 1936 \u2014 before antibiotics were invented and made abortion less risky.", "lang": "en"}
