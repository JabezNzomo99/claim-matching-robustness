But only 36% of principals are women.\u201d\n\nus to check if this was true.\n\nin the City Press newspaper headlined \u201cMotshekga: Only 36% of school principals are women.\u201d\n\nIt was about the launch of a support network for female principals addressed by\n\n, she said: \u201cThere are 257,633 female teachers (68.3%) and 119,579 male teachers (31.7%) in public schools in the country.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThere are only 8,210 female principals and 14,337 male principals appointed in permanent posts. Female principals represent only 36.4% of all principals.\u201d\n\nWomen make up over 70% of state-paid teachers\n\nThe chief director of media liaison and communications in the basic education department, Elijah Mhlanga, gave Africa Check the latest numbers on teachers working in public schools.\n\nIn June 2018, there were 387,328 teachers and principals on the government\u2019s payroll. Women made up\n\n72.5% of state-paid teachers, but only 37.3% of principals.\n\nEquality in school leadership not much improved\n\nemerges at the middle management level and widens at higher post levels\u201d.\n\nIn the past decade there has been little improvement in gender equality in school leadership, Wills said. \u201cFor example, the percentage of principals who were women only improved by two percentage points from\n\nWills said this could be a reflection of gender stereotypes \u201cand subtle practices of discrimination suffered by women in the workplace and at home\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt may also be attributed to the possibility that fewer female teachers apply for leadership positions, rather than just reflecting the unequal appointment of men over women.\u201d\n\nBut more data is needed to assess possible discrimination in the process of selecting principals.\n\n\u201cCurrently, data on who applies for posts is not systematically collected in South Africa, so we don\u2019t know who applied but didn\u2019t get a promotion post,\u201d Wills said.\n\n\u201cSchools and leadership programmes need to build the leadership identity of female teachers, encouraging them to step into more senior roles.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Data shows women make up 72.5% of teachers and 37.3% of principals on state payroll\n\nIn an article on women\u2019s experience of leadership in schools,\n\nacademic Nuraan Davids wrote that while women made up about 68% of South Africa\u2019s teaching force, only 36% of principals were female.\n\nHer figures came from an August 2013 speech by basic education minister Angie Motshekga.\n\nState payroll data from June 2018 suggested that women made up even more of the teaching force: 72.5% of teachers employed by the government were women. But share of female principals was also higher, at 37.3%.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim as mostly correct.", "lang": "en"}
