However Dengvaxia\u2019s maker, Sanofi, has told AFP it is not selling the vaccine in India.\n\nThe post claims the price of Dengvaxia is 12 rupees (about 16 US cents) a piece in India, more than 100 times cheaper than its price in the Philippines before it was pulled from the market there.\n\n\n\nDengvaxia\u2019s price is a sensitive issue in the Philippines because a world-first, government-led mass inoculation campaign ended in controversy in late 2017 after questions arose over the vaccine\u2019s safety.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the post:\n\nWhen translated into English the post says: \u201cDengvaxia in India only costs 12 Rupees/piece. 12 rupees = 9 pesos and 35 cents in our money.It was sold by bald guy for P1,000 per piece here\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cbald guy\u201d refers to former president Benigno Aquino III, whose picture appears in the Facebook post and led the Philippines from 2010 to the middle of 2016.\n\nHis administration paid 1,000 pesos ($18) per dose of Dengvaxia in 2016, according to a Senate report into the issue. The price can be viewed on page 48 of the report.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of the portion of the Senate report which discussed how much the Aquino government paid for Dengvaxia per dose:\n\nThe post offered no evidence to back its claim that Dengvaxia was being sold for 12 rupees in India.\n\nThe vaccine\u2019s maker, Sanofi, also told AFP the claims about it being sold in India were incorrect.\n\n\u201cDengvaxia is not approved in India so the information you\u2019ve been given is inaccurate\u201d, said Jack Cox, a Sanofi spokesman, in an e-mail to AFP.\n\nUnder Aquino\u2019s administration, more than 800,000 children received Dengvaxia in what was the world\u2019s first public dengue immunisation programme.\n\nSanofi and the Aquino administration hailed it as a major step towards combating dengue, which kills hundreds in the Philippines every year, mostly children.\n\nThe programme ended after Sanofi said in 2017 the vaccine could lead to more severe symptoms in people who had not previously been infected with dengue.\n\nSanofi insisted the vaccine was still safe but the administration of Rodrigo Duterte, Aquino\u2019s successor and political rival, suspended the Dengvaxia programme.\n\nHere is an AFP report from December 2017 on the suspension.\n\nSupporters of Duterte have sought to use the issue to discredit Aquino.\n\nThe false post has been shared more than 7,000 times by Facebook pages and groups that support Duterte and his political allies, according to data from social media monitoring platform CrowdTangle.", "lang": "en"}
