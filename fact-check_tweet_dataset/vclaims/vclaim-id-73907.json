Buffalo Wild Wings debunked nearly identical fake offer on Aug. 10.\n\nThe viral post, purportedly from the official Buffalo Wild Wings Facebook page, shares a promotion offering coupons for free wings to everyone that shares and comments on it by 8 p.m. on Aug. 11.\n\n\u201cCelebrating our 38th Birthday, We here at Buffalo Wild Wings are giving Everyone who shares and also comments by 8 PM Tuesday \u2013 50 free wings in any flavor \u2013 We Will Inbox Your Coupon \u2013 Participants Must Like Our Page \u2013 Buffalo Wild Wings,\u201d reads the post.\n\nThe offer, however, is not a valid promotion from Buffalo Wild Wings. The Facebook page, which was created Aug. 10, does not have the same handle as Buffalo Wild Wings\u2019 official page, and it also lacks the blue check mark that indicates it has been verified by Facebook. Searching the Buffalo Wild Wings website and its official Facebook page turned up no such promotion.\n\nBuffalo Wild Wings posted on Facebook a screen grab of a page offering a nearly identical fake promotion on Aug. 10, labeling the offer as \u201cfake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you see this in your feed today, it is NOT REAL,\u201d the post reads. \u201cThis is a fake account with no verified blue checkmark.\u201d (RELATED: Is Little Caesars Offering Free Pizza To Anyone Who Shares And Comments On A Facebook Post?)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a fake Buffalo Wild Wings promotion has circulated on social media. In March 2019, the restaurant chain debunked a similar scam from an unaffiliated Facebook page masquerading as the brand.\n\n\u201cA post making its way around Facebook offering 50 free wings is a SCAM \u2026 Please, don\u2019t be fooled and report the page if you come across it,\u201d reads Buffalo Wild Wings\u2019 March 2019 Facebook post.", "lang": "en"}
