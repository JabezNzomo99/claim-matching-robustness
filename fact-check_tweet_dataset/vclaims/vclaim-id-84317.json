The videos in fact show a doctored version of footage from a historic meeting in April 2018 between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nOne version of the video, which we\u2019ve archived here, has been viewed more than 50,000 times and shared more than 2,000 times since it was posted by the Facebook page News Custodian Nigeria on June 6.\n\nThe same video was posted by the Facebook page IPOB.com on June 9 and has since been viewed some 19,000 times and shared 700 times.\n\n\u201cA Korean corrupt Politician gets his salary!\u201d reads the caption on both videos.\n\nMany of the comments suggested the same punishment should be handed to corrupt politicians in the users\u2019 own countries, be it Nigeria, Ghana or elsewhere.\n\nSome people clearly took the video as a joke, reacting with the \u201claughing\u201d emoji. Others were more unsure, asking if the video was real or not.\n\nIn the comments section, some users correctly identified the video as an edited version of footage from the historic moment on April 27, 2018 when Kim became the first North Korean leader to cross the border into the South since the Korean War ceasefire in 1953.\n\nYou can see Kim and Moon\u2019s encounter at the border as it actually happened in this video by Australian broadcaster ABC.\n\nYou can read AFP\u2019s report about the historic meeting here.\n\nThe two Koreas went on to have two further summits in 2018, agreeing in September to pursue economic developments and avoid military conflicts of any kind along the border.\n\nBut inter-Korean relations have been at a standstill since Kim met with US President Donald Trump in Hanoi in February, a summit that broke down without an agreement.\n\nPyongyang has been disgruntled over what it sees as Seoul\u2019s lack of action in pursuing inter-Korean economic projects. But at a time when the North is under multiple sanctions barring such developments, carrying out such projects is unlikely.", "lang": "en"}
