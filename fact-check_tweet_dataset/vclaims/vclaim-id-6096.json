Bill Cassidy (R-La.) says his plan will boost health-insurance coverage. But the evidence is slim.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2017-09-21T07:00:52Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-6096", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/09/21/sen-cassidys-rebuttal-to-jimmy-kimmel-more-people-will-have-coverage/?utm_term=.eba4dfb96364", "vclaim": "The block grants would increase according to an index lower than general inflation \u2014 not according to how many people are covered or what diseases they have \u2014 so the total pot would grow more slowly than under current law. All funding would be terminated by 2027, unless Congress acted at the time to continue it.\n\nPresumably, this is where Kimmel gets his 30 million figure \u2014 from previous CBO scores of eliminating the ACA without a real replacement. But he repeated \u201ckicked off\u201d language, often used by Democrats, that The Fact Checker has previously found to be misleading. The CBO has a lot of faith in the power of the individual mandate, so it negatively scored proposals that eliminated the mandate.\n\nMany of the people who would be uninsured, at least initially, would choose not to have insurance, because they had decided to obtain coverage only to avoid a penalty. So they are not being kicked off but leaving of their own accord.\n\nFor instance, the respected health-care consultant Avalere Health concluded that California would face a 13 percent shortfall ($78 billion between 2020 and 2026) under Cassidy-Graham compared to current law. But in theory, the state could decide to create a single-payer system that could cover everyone, so that would certainly increase coverage. In fact, the trade group for insurance companies \u2014 America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans \u2014 opposes the bill in part because it could \u201cbuild a bridge to single-payer systems.\u201d\n\nThe bill also has incentives for states to focus on the U.S. population with income at 50 to 138 percent of the federal poverty line ($24,600 for a family of four), as block grant funding would be allocated according to the level of insurance coverage in that income range. States might then alter essential benefit rules to offer skimpy low-premium plans for everyone else in the individual insurance market. No one knows if such plans would meet the CBO\u2019s definition of \u201ccomprehensive coverage,\u201d but if they did, then in theory it could lead more people to buy such insurance.\n\nSimilarly, Manatt Health, a unit of a national law firm that advises states on health-care issues, concluded that \u201cthe legislation could create significant fiscal and political pressure on state policymakers\u201d as the federal funds were reduced over time. Only 16 states would initially experience an increase in funding under the bill, according to the Avalere analysis, while over time a per capita cap in Medicaid funding would begin to squeeze, especially in the second decade after passage.\n\n\u201cWe struggled mightily with the challenge of estimating coverage losses and ultimately concluded it was impossible to do, at least to the standards we hold ourselves to in our work,\u201d Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said in an email. The coverage levels \u201cwill quite literally depend on what each of the 50 states do (and don\u2019t do) with the block grants they would receive.\u201d\n\nBut he added: \u201cI think it\u2019s a very high bar to argue that federal funding to states will be cut by $160 billion (other estimates are higher) between 2020 and 2026 (forget whether it ends in 2027 or not) and coverage will stay the same or increase. Nobel Prize in economics for whoever pulls that one off.\u201d\n\nRegular readers of The Fact Checker know that the burden of proof falls on the person making the claim. Cassidy has provided little evidence to support his claim of more coverage, except that innovation would flourish and help bring down costs and expand coverage. That\u2019s certainly possible, but it would be more plausible if his proposal did not slash funding to such an extent.\n\nKimmel\u2019s claim that 30 million fewer Americans will have insurance may be a high-end estimate. But already, in 2019, CBO calculations suggest at least 15 million fewer Americans would have insurance once the individual and employer mandates are repealed. Much of that decline might be by choice, but Cassidy insists the gap will be filled and then exceeded in 10 years. Unlike Cassidy, no prominent health-care analyst is willing to venture a guess on coverage levels \u2014 but the consensus is that his funding formula makes his claim all but impossible to achieve.", "lang": "en"}
