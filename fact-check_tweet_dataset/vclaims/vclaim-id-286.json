We want to be very clear: DHS Child Welfare in Oregon does not identify a parent\u2019s medical condition as a safety threat and sole reason for removal of children. We do have the capability, within our current rule and procedure, to work with a legal parent/guardian on a voluntary basis, to make a temporary plan for their child(ren) if they are too ill to care for their children. We would explore all options with a parent/guardian in that circumstance including their friends, family and community resources. If we exhausted all options, we could place their child in foster care. This would be a voluntary placement that does not affect a parent\u2019s custodial rights and does not involve the child dependency legal system.\n\n\u201cThe transmittal was intended to provide guidance to our staff on how to document this scenario in the case management system, should it occur, if the parent is ill due to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nSunny Petit, press secretary for the Oregon DHS, told Reuters via email: \u201cWe do not want anyone to avoid getting treatment or tested because of a fear that their children would be taken away.\u201d\n\nReuters recently debunked a similar claim stating that a positive COVID-19 test could result in the \u201cremoval of children\u201d according to a fake letter attributed to the California Department for Social Services ( here ).\n\nFalse. A COVID-19 diagnosis of a parent is not considered a safety threat warranting children\u2019s removal from the household by Oregon\u2019s Child Welfare office. Foster care is offered on a voluntary basis if parents are too ill to take care of their children.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
