Vishvas News investigated the video and found that the claim that a woman got pregnant via mouth by eating squids is false.\n\nThe viral video is shared by the Facebook page \u2018Amar Ujala\u2019. The post has \n\n4.6 million views, 19000 reactions, 7317 shares, and 320 comments. The video is supported by a caption: \u201c\u092e\u0947\u0921\u093f\u0915\u0932 \u091c\u0917\u0924 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0930- \u092a\u0947\u091f \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u091c\u093e\u092f \u092e\u0941\u0902\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0917\u0928\u0947\u0902\u091f \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e (For the first time in the medical world- a female impregnated via mouth rather than stomach). The video shares a grotesque tale of a 63-years-old South Korean woman who got pregnant by eating semi-cooked squids. As per the viral video, the incident has been also published by the Journal of Parasitology.\n\nThe bizarre story claiming that the woman in South Korea was impregnated via mouth after eating squids, made tabloid headlines as various media outlets picked up the story.\n\nWe checked the comments of the viral Facebook post and found many users questioning the authenticity of the claim.\n\nWe searched the claim on Google using relevant keywords and found many related stories.\n\nAs per the claim, as soon as the woman ate the squids she felt pain in her mouth and spat the undercooked seafood out, but still could feel the bugs burrowing into her mouth. As per the report published by Pathology International, \u201cWe found that several small whitish spindle\u2010shaped stings were stuck to the mucous membrane of the hard palate. The biopsy showed that the sperm bags of the squid had thrust into the squamous epithelium of the patient. The remaining part of the raw squid consisted of the testis and the sperm bags. After removal of all stings, the pain reduced, and the wound healed in due course.\u201d\n\nThe report published on Journal of Parasitology didn\u2019t make things sound any better. It stated: \u201cOn the basis of their morphology and the presence of the sperm bag, the foreign bodies were identified as squid spermatophores.\u201d\n\nWe then found a report by Snopes, which clarified that the woman never got pregnant with squid. The report states that, a woman received several painful stings after she ate the squids in 2011. This woman was not impregnated by a squid.\n\nHere\u2019s a snippet from the abstract of the report:\n\nThere is a big difference between insemination and impregnation. Impregnate (in reproduction, not manufacturing) means that successful fertilization has already taken place: sperm met with egg and an embryo is developing. This did not happen. There was no impregnation, no pregnancy, and no baby squid.\n\nA website science2.0 also weighed in on the debate days after the bizarre tale surfaced and wrote: \u201cnobody ever got pregnant from eating squid, or from any other contact with squid, and furthermore, it is not possible to become pregnant from eating squid, or from any other contact with squid.\u201d\n\nWe also contacted a doctor and here is what he replied:\n\nDr. Sajeev Kumar, C.S.C, D.C.H, M.B.B.S, General Physician: This is absolutely false. It is not possible to become pregnant from eating squid.\n\nThe claim that the South Korean woman was impregnated by a squid is misleading. She received several painful stings after she ate the squids.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right. If you have a doubt on any news that could impact you, society or the nation, let us know.
