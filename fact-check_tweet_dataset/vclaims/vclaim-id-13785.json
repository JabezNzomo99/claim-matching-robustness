Jagan, the head of YSRCP, on the election day. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: Prashant Kishor: \u201cAll the hard work our team has been doing for past 2 years is now going in vain. Since Y.S. Jagan is not sure of magic figure, he has turned his back and bringing in all the commercials. Working with Jagan Reddy\u2019s party will be a regret for a lifetime.\u201d Fact: The tweet is fake. Prashant Kishor has himself tweeted saying that the post is fake. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen looked for this tweet on his Twitter account, it is found that Prashant Kishor has himself tweeted on this issue saying: \u201c[email protected] when you lose trust of the people and your faith in their wisdom, after abuses and lies, you stoop down to circulating fake news. Few hours left for the polling to close but it\u2019s clear that people of AP have decided their verdict. It is time to say #ByeByeBabu\u201d. Also, before Kishor has tweeted the above tweet on his account, FACTLY has contacted IPAC\u2019s Digital Media Head Mr. Brahma, who has clarified that the tweet is fake and is a cheap trick coming from the opposition parties on the election day. So, the post claiming that Prashant Kishor has tweeted against Jagan is FALSE.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s a fake tweet. Prashant Kishor has not tweeted against Y.S. Jagan.", "lang": "en"}
