But if it\u2019s true, it\u2019s obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?\u201d Sessions: \u201cSenator Franken, I\u2019m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I didn\u2019t have \u2014 did not have communications with the Russians, and I\u2019m unable to comment on it.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he maintains he was not answering the final part of the question \u2014 whether \u201canyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign.\u201d Sessions said later he should \u201chave slowed down and said, \u2018But I did meet one Russian official a couple of times, and that would be the ambassador.\u2019 \u201d But he said that meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were strictly in his capacity as U.S. senator and were not about the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Washington Post reported in July that Kislyak told his superiors in Moscow that during two conversations with Sessions he discussed campaign-related matters, including policy issues important to Moscow, during the 2016 presidential race, according to communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies. Sessions has insisted he \u201cconducted no improper discussions with Russians at any time regarding a campaign or any other item facing this country.\u201d\n\nFranken: \u201cNow, was that what you\u2019re saying that you still \u2014 you don\u2019t believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d Sessions: \u201cI did not, and I\u2019m not aware of anyone else that did, and I don\u2019t believe it happened.\u201d Franken: \u201cAnd you don\u2019t believe it now?\u201d\n\nAnalysis: In light of the Papadopoulos guilty plea, this exchange could prove problematic for Sessions. The March 2016 meeting placed both Sessions and Trump at the table with Papadopoulos as he allegedly touted his Russian contacts to pitch a meeting between Putin and Trump. But what loomed larger in Papadopoulos\u2019s mind might have not made as much of an impact on others around the table.\n\n\u201cIt seems clear that the people who remember the conversation believed that Papadopoulos was proposing a prospective idea of using his \u2018Russian contacts\u2019 to try to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin, which was immediately rejected by then-Senator Sessions,\u201d said a source familiar with Sessions\u2019s recollection told The Fact Checker. \u201cAt the time, of course, Papadopoulos was some 29-year-old that nobody had ever heard of and who struck people in the room as someone who didn\u2019t have a lot of credibility. As far as Sessions seemed to be concerned, when he shut down this idea of Papadopoulos engaging with Russia, that was the end of it, and he moved the meeting along to other issues.\u201d\n\nYet The Washington Post also reported that \u201cPapadopoulos sat at the elbow of Sessions, then a senator and one of Trump\u2019s top campaign advisers, during a dinner for campaign advisers weeks before the Republican National Convention.\u201d The source said Papadopoulos may have been at the dinner but that Sessions \u201chas no clear recollection of this person\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t recall any further interactions with him, including any phone calls or emails.\u201d The source insisted that Papadopoulos\u2019s remarks at the March 2016 meeting \u201cdid not leave a lasting impression.\u201d\n\nThe meeting took place more than 1\u00bd years ago. The court documents do not indicate whether Papadopoulos said he had been in contact with Russians, only that he had Russian contacts. But this is yet another instance in which new information emerges that raises questions about Sessions\u2019s previous testimony before Congress. One can imagine that the next time Sessions testifies, he will be asked for more details of the meeting and his interactions with Papadopoulos.\n\n (About our rating scale)", "lang": "en"}
