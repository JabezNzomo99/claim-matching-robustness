Parents and guardians cannot visit for some days.' The man replied, 'But I'm a JNU student.'\" - read the caption along with the photo posted by Facebook user \"Rakesh Krishnan Simha\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the man in the photo has nothing to do with JNU. He is Professor Kancha Ilaiah, a writer and Dalit ideologue from Telangana.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the post was already shared more than 750 times. In the comment section, many people have taken the post sarcastically, but some others have taken it seriously.\n\nAFWA found some users in the comment section pointed out that the man in the photo is Professor Kancha Ilaiah. Taking this as a clue, we checked out his photos and reached out to him for confirmation.\n\nProfessor Ilaiah confirmed to us that the photo is his and the claim is bogus. He said he never studied in JNU and will file a complaint against the post.\n\nProfessor Ilaiah is a writer and Dalit rights activist. Before his retirement, Ilaiah was the director of the Centre for Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy at Maulana Azad National Urdu University (MANUU) in Hyderabad. He also holds a PhD in Buddhism.\n\nSince the protests by JNU students started last week, many unrelated images have been going viral on social media, linking them to university students and protests. Many images of protesters have also gone viral with misleading claims.", "lang": "en"}
