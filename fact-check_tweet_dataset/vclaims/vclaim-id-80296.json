The video is not from the ill-fated plane but an earlier flight in Indonesia that did not crash.\n\nLion Air Flight JT 610 crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take off on Monday October 29 with 189 people on board. There were no survivors.\n\nWithin hours of the plane going missing a video began circulating online claiming to show passengers inside a darkened cabin calling out: \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d, or \u201cGod is greater\u201d, and other Islamic verses as the plane apparently was out of control.\n\nAFP has tracked down dozens of Facebook pages that have posted the video with claims it was from the crashed Lion Air plane, including @SpotLightHumanity where it has been viewed more than 1.3 million times.\n\nIt has also been viewed more than 220,000 times on an Arabic blogger\u2019s page, 100,000 times on a Pakistani celebrity pics page, and a combined 100,000 times on two aviation pages: @Airplane4 and @Airplane13.\n\nAmong news outlets, Russia Today posted the video on its Arabic Twitter account where it has been viewed more than 90,000 times.\n\nThe video also appeared on news websites in Greece, Pakistan, India and Tunisia.\n\nThe video went viral despite Indonesian authorities reacting quickly to say it was from a previous Lion Air flight, which did not crash.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s disaster mitigation agency spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said on Twitter on October 29 -- the day of the crash -- that the video was from Lion Air flight JT 353 to Jakarta from Padang, another Indonesian city on an unspecified earlier date.\n\nHis tweet translates as: \u201cThis video IS NOT showing passengers of Lion Air JT 610. This is of passengers of Lion Air JT 353 Padang-Jakarta some time ago which was experiencing turbulence. All passengers were safe. There are no video/photo of JT 610 passengers before the plane crashed. Please don\u2019t spread hoaxes.\u201d\n\nSutopo did not give details as to where the video originated.\n\nAFP tracked the video\u2019s origin to the private Instagram account @marapi_singgalang.\n\nThe Instagram post was accompanied by a lengthy caption which, in part, says: \u201cDeep condolences for the incident experienced by @lionairgroup plane #lionair #lionjt610. This is a video taken by myself on a flight that made me so traumatised I no longer want to travel by plane.\u201d\n\nAFP spoke with David Ditama, who owns the @marapi_singgalang Instagram account, on October 31.\n\nDitama told AFP he was was aboard the Lion Air JT 353 flight, which was heading to Jakarta from Padang, on December 11, 2017.\n\nDitama said he took the video from a clip he posted to Twitter on December 13, 2017, and that he re-posted it on Instagram as a way to express his emotions following the crash of JT 610.\n\nDitama said he made clear in his Instagram post where the video came from, and that he was surprised it had been shared and misrepresented without his permission.\n\n\u201cI don't know who might have circulated the video without my permission and then misused it,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nThe original post on Ditama\u2019s Twitter account can be seen below.", "lang": "en"}
