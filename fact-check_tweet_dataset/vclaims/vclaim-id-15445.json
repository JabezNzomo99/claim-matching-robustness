He could contest the elections. Would you not greet 'Mahi Bhai'?)\n\nAt the time of writing the article, the post had been shared more than 900 times. You can view the post below and its archived version here.\n\nMeanwhile Sanjay Dutt\u2019s photo holding a pamphlet of the Sampark for Samarthan campaign along with the Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, has been captioned as \u201cBollywood star Sanju bhai also joined BJP\u201d on Facebook.\n\nOne of the posts can be viewed below and its archived version here.\n\nIncidentally, this is not the first time that rumours have floated about Dutt joining the BJP. In May 2016 several posts claimed that the actor would join BJP after he participated in party funded event.\n\nDutt clarified on March 25 through a tweet that he isn\u2019t contesting the polls and is in full support of his sister Priya Dutt, who is an active member of the Indian National Congress. BOOM separately tried to reach Dutt for a comment, however the actor has not responded. The article will be updated once he responds.\n\nBOOM also ran a reverse search on the image of Dutt with Yogi Aditanath and found that it was clicked when the actor met the UP chief minister in June, last year. They met as part of BJP\u2019s Sampark for Samarthan campaign, at the chief minister\u2019s residence in Lucknow. The photo was tweeted by Yogi Adityanath on June 9, 2018. Dutt in turn retweeted the photograph and thanked Yogi Adityanath for including him in the initiative.\n\nA reverse image search on Dhoni\u2019s photo showed that it was taken on August last year, as part of the same campaign. Another photograph from the same event shows the former Indian captain with the similar poster that Dutt was endorsing.\n\nThe same photo can seen in an August 5, 2018 tweet by BJP national president Amit Shah.\n\nThe Sampark for Samarthan is a programme that began last year with an aim to reach out to personalities from various fields to generate awareness about the government\u2019s achievements so far.\n\nLast week West Indies cricket player Chris Gayle was subject to one such rumour on social media which claimed that he would campaign for the BJP.", "lang": "en"}
