They murder each other. They murder their unborn babies. They murder white people. They hate police officers and murder some of them, even black ones. They destroy neighbors and entire cities with garbage and drugs. They live their lives off the hard-earned tax dollars of other Americans. Yet somehow they are victims. What insanity is that?\"\n\nThe comments have been retweeted more than 5,400 times.\n\nBut the person in the Facebook message, Catherine Nardi, is not the wife of the Ferguson police chief.\n\nNardi lives in St. Petersburg, Fla., not Missouri, according to public records. She is married to Henry Nardi, who is not the police chief of Ferguson. We reached out to Nardi via Facebook, but she did not respond. A woman answering a phone number associated with her hung up on a reporter. (Nardi removed her Facebook profile after this fact-check first published.)\n\nAccording to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jackson\u2019s wife is named Patricia, not Catherine. We were unable to reach Jackson\u2019s wife.\n\nAs for the specific words in the message, we did not find them on Nardi\u2019s Facebook page or anywhere else.\n\nA post from a group claiming that it is associated with Anonymous said that the wife of the Ferguson, Mo., police chief said African-Americans in Ferguson \"are feral and violent,\" among other things.\n\nThe tweet references a Facebook post that is not from Jackson\u2019s wife. The woman in the picture lives in Florida not Missouri.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
