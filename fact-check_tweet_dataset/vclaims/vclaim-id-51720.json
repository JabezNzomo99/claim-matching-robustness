That quote could not be found in his remarks at either event and, furthermore, he did not tweet on August 12. In all, there is no record of Trump having uttered those words, and the author of the earliest iteration of the post admitted shortly after the Tweet went viral that it was satire:\n\nTrump has had plenty to say about what Biden will do if elected, but \u201cIf you elect Joe Biden, I will go to prison\u201d is not one such thing.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
