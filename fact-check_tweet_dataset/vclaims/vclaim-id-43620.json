Beto O\u2019Rourke asked for help getting immigrants in the country illegally to the polls so they could vote.\n\nIt is true that Hannity said that. What is not true is that O\u2019Rourke is asking for that help.\n\nO\u2019Rourke is seeking to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate. He\u2019s challenging incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. The election is Nov. 6.\n\n\"Hannity tells radio audience that Beto O\u2019Rourke is asking for help in getting undocumented to vote,\" said a Sept. 7 post on joemygod.com. The website includes posts about politics, LGBT news and entertainment. The site\u2019s Twitter account has more than 68,000 followers.\n\nJoemygod.com\u2019s story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe story accurately reflects what Hannity said on his Sept. 7 radio show.\n\nThe conservative pundit said: \"A text message was sent out by a Democratic Senate hopeful down, where is this, in Texas. With this guy, what\u2019s his name \u2014 O\u2019Rourke, everybody loves so much, Beto O\u2019Rourke is the guy\u2019s name. Locked in a tight race, they say, with Ted Cruz \u2014 I think Ted Cruz will win.\"\n\nHannity adds that Cruz has been \"an enormous help\" and a reliable senator for President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Anyway, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s race, it goes on to say, \u2018we are in search of volunteers to help transport undocumented immigrants to polling booths.\u2019 They\u2019re doing that in Texas. I\u2019m not making it up, it was in the Austin American-Statesman,\" Hannity said.\n\nWhat Hannity failed to mention is that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said the text message \"was sent by an impostor,\" and not by O\u2019Rourke or his team, according to an American-Statesman Sept. 5 story. The Austin American-Statesman publishes PolitiFact Texas.\n\nThe joemygod.com story is accurate. We rate it True.\n\nEditor's note: We revised the ruling statement of this fact-check Sept. 18 in effort to make the focus of this fact-check (which is that Hannity told his listeners inaccurate information) more clear. No other changes were made.", "lang": "en"}
