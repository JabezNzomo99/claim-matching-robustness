But, FACTLY found that the information shared in the post about the video is false. The name of the person who was being beaten in the video is \u2018Somanath\u2019; police have said that he works as a snake charmer in Dehradun. In 2018, police tweeted about the incident and said that when Somanath went to beg dressed as a \u2018Naga Sadhu\u2019 and misbehaved with a woman, he was beaten up by the woman\u2019s brother, \u2018Subham\u2019. Subham is not a Muslim. Therefore, the person who was seen beaten up in the video is neither a \u2018Naga Sadhu\u2019 nor the person who beat him is a \u2018Muslim\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
