These figures are for primary, secondary and special schools.\n\n250 black Caribbean pupils were permanently excluded in 2014/15, making up 0.28% of all black Caribbean pupils in England. Across all ethnic groups 5,770 pupils were permanently excluded or 0.08%.\n\nThe difference was bigger for boys than girls. Black Caribbean boys were almost four times as likely to be excluded compared to all male students; black Caribbean girls were twice as likely.\n\nBlack Caribbean students were also twice as likely to be permanently excluded as black students as a whole.\n\nGypsy/Roma students and pupils who were travellers of Irish heritage had the highest rate of exclusion: they were both six times more likely to be excluded than all students. But the Department for Education said these figures should be \u201ctreated with some caution\u201d since these groups of pupils are quite small.\n\nAsian students, particularly those of Indian descent, were the least likely to be permanently excluded.", "lang": "en"}
