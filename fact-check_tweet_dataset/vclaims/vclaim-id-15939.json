Trump did issue a statement about child separation in 2018, but the quote is only half accurate.\n\nIn April 2018, the Trump administration announced a zero tolerance policy at the southern border that led to the separation of children from their parents or adult guardians, who were to be criminally prosecuted. Facing backlash, the administration backed off the policy only months later.\n\nThe first lady did issue a statement about the policy through a spokesperson that June, and similar to the meme\u2019s quote, it said \u201cMrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families.\u201d\n\nBut she did not say \u201cwe can hardly blame Donald.\u201d The first lady \u201chopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cShe believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.\u201d\n\nAs for the quote from Braun, who married Hitler shortly before they both committed suicide, the image appears to allude to the family separation that took place during the Holocaust. The meme claims she made the remark in 1939, but there is no evidence she ever said it, in that year or any other.\n\n\u201cI did 15 years of research on EB and never came across that quote,\u201d Professor Thomas Lundmark, a biographer of Braun, told The Daily Caller in an email.", "lang": "en"}
