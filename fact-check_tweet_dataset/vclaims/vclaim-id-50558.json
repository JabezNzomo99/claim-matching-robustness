The claim is misleading; dermatologists warn toothpaste can irritate your skin as it is not designed to be applied directly to your face.\n\nThe post was shared here on Facebook on October 10, 2018. It has been shared more than 280 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nPart of the post\u2019s Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201c#NewDimensionofApplyonAcne I heard that toothpaste can deflate acne, so we tried it on our model. The result is acne has reduced in size. Like obviously, just applying the toothpaste on acne.\u201d\n\nThe post was published alongside four photos: the first is a branded toothpaste, and the other three are a series of photos that appear to show the gradual decrease of a pimple on a model\u2019s forehead.\n\nA similar claim was also shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here in Thai and here, here and here in English.\n\nThe claim is misleading; health experts warn that some ingredients in toothpaste can irritate the skin.\n\nOn January 16, 2020, the British Association of Dermatologists tweeted: \u201cFALSE! Toothpaste does include anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory ingredients, but it can be irritating to the skin and causes severe discolouration. You should instead use targeted acne treatments which are safe to apply to the skin.\u201d\n\nThis October 14, 2019 report by the Cleveland Clinic, a US-based academic medical center, also says that toothpaste is \u201cnot intended to be put directly on your face\u201d.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the article:\n\nIt reads, in part: \u201cMany toothpastes contain ingredients like alcohol or baking soda that may help dry out a pimple. But, toothpaste also contains other ingredients that aren\u2019t intended to be put directly on your face. She cautions that using toothpaste to treat a pimple could possibly irritate your skin.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Thai-language Facebook posts, such as this and this, mentions \u201cNop-Kao\u201d toothpaste as an effective acne remedy.\n\nKru Tip, a representative for \u201cNop-Kao\u201d, told AFP via phone on March 9, 2020, that while some people have used the toothpaste for curing acne, the main purpose of the toothpaste is to improve the oral health and reducing bad breath.\n\n\u201cThe toothpaste is made from many herbs that can protect your teeth and gum,\u201d she said.", "lang": "en"}
