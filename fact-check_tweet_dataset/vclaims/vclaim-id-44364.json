The claims are false; the manufacturer put the suggested retail price at around $20, and a total of 30 were used.\n\nThere are a variety of claims circulating online about the price of the pens used in the January 15, 2020 signing, including that they cost $2,500 or $15,000 each, or $5,000 or $15,000 in total.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi used 30 different pens to sign the articles of impeachment. The use of numerous pens on important political documents is a tradition in the United States that has been followed by both Democratic and Republican politicians.\n\n\u201cThese pens were manufactured by Garland Writing Instruments, a 93-year old manufacturer located in Coventry, Rhode Island,\u201d the company\u2019s president, Rick Becker, told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cThe pens have a MSRP of around $20,\u201d said Becker, referring to the manufacturer suggested retail price.\n\n\u201cWe sell our pens through promotion products distributors and they determine the final price to the customer,\u201d he said, later adding that it \u201cwould not surprise me that a distributor gave a high profile customer a discount.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur reaction to the false claims that these pens cost thousands of dollars each is quite flattering, but unfortunately for us, not true,\u201d Becker said.\n\nTrump is on trial in the Senate, where Republicans hold enough seats to likely ensure his acquittal on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nThe \u201csouvenir\u201d pens used to sign the articles of impeachment drew fire from Republicans, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell criticizing the proceedings as \u201cnot solemn or serious,\u201d and White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham saying that Pelosi \u201cwas so somber as she gave (the pens) away to people like prizes.\u201d\n\nDuring the president\u2019s Senate trial, Trump\u2019s personal attorney Jay Sekulow also took aim at the distribution of the pens following the signing, saying he wanted to \u201ccontrast the solemn nature of these proceedings... with what took place in the House of Representatives upon the signing of articles of impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cPens. Distributed to the impeachment managers. A celebratory moment,\u201d Sekulow said.\n\nThis story has been covered by other media organizations including FactCheck.org.", "lang": "en"}
