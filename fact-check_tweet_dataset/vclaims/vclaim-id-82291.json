But now we\u2019re talking about 200,000. Obama is getting carried away again with this whole thing about immigration. And now we hear 200,000 and it could very well be ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama wants to \u2014 listen to this \u2014 he wants to take in 200,000. You know, 200,000. That\u2019s like an army. Now I\u2019m looking the other day. It\u2019s all men. Like, where are the women? They\u2019re very strong men. Why aren\u2019t they back there fighting for their country?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I hear we want to take in 200,000. We don\u2019t know where they\u2019re coming from. We don\u2019t know who they are. They could be ISIS. It could be the great Trojan Horse\u2026. And I\u2019m saying we\u2019re going to take in 200,000 people that we have no idea where they come from?\u201d\n\nOur colleagues at FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have already weighed in with fact checks, but given that Trump keeps saying this, we figured it was worth putting the question to the Pinocchio test.\n\nWe do not know where Trump gets his numbers \u2014 his campaign rarely responds to fact check queries \u2014 but the only thing close to a 200,000 figure is an announcement by Secretary of State John Kerry that the United States was prepared to boost the number of total refugees accepted in 2016, from 70,000 to 85,000. Then, in 2017, Kerry said that 100,000 would be accepted.\n\nThat adds up to 185,000 over two years. But this would be the total number of refugees, not the number of refugees from Syria.\n\nBy law, the president every fiscal year sets the maximum number of refugees the United States can accept in a year. Over the past decade, the annual limit has been between 70,000 and 80,000, according to the Congressional Research Service. So, 100,000 in 2017 would be a big jump, assuming Obama goes through with the pledge to authorize that level.\n\nBut for Syria, Obama has only directed the United States to accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year. That\u2019s an increase of six times from 2015, but it\u2019s hardly the flood that Trump worries about. In fact, in the interview with MSNBC, Trump indicated he would be fine with just 10,000.\n\nTrump needs to quit using the 200,000 figure for the number of Syrians the administration has signaled it would accept \u2014 and reporters need to challenge him when he repeats it. In the meantime he earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
