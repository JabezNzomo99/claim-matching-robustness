Joe Morrisey, disgraced former Subway ad spokesman Jared Fogle, and film director Roman Polanski. The cases listed are not connected to each other or to the Epstein case, but instead are a compilation of (mostly) influential men who have been accused and/or convicted of sexual misconduct.\n\nEpstein was arrested in July 2019 on sex-trafficking charges and committed suicide in jail while awaiting trial. The billionaire financier and previously convicted sex offender was accused of trafficking girls to be victimized by some of the most powerful people in the world. Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s ex-girlfriend, was arrested on related charges in July 2020; prosecutors claim she facilitated Epstein\u2019s sexual abuse of minors.\n\nBecause Epstein and Maxwell associated with the world\u2019s political and celebrity elite, their activities have been the subject of public fascination and rumor.\n\nIt\u2019s true that a federal judge made public previously sealed court documents from a defamation lawsuit against Maxwell filed by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre; among the documents were transcripts from a 2016 deposition given by Giuffre. But the unsealed documents, which were uploaded from the federal court records database PACER and posted online by the legal news website Law & Crime, don\u2019t contain the list of names in the Facebook post.\n\nWe should note several \u201clists\u201d exist associated with the Epstein case, including the names of people who have flown on his private plane and the people listed in Epstein\u2019s \u201cblack book\u201d directory. However, these lists have been in the public domain since well before the most recent court documents were unsealed.", "lang": "en"}
