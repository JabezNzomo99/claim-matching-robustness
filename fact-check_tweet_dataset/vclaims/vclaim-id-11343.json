But this figure includes both the employed and the unemployed.\n\u2022 None Only 2.7 million Kenyans are in formal employment. But 3.2 million have filed or made PAYE payments to the country\u2019s tax authority. \n\n\n\nthat increased taxes on many goods and services, including an 8% tax on petroleum products.\n\nincreases were needed to balance the books, the presidency\n\n. One top official in Kenyatta\u2019s\n\n, admitting it was an unpopular move, said the public was \u201coverburdened with taxation\u201d.\n\nRaphael Tuju, the party\u2019s secretary-general, was speaking on\n\ntelevision in September 2018 after the public outcry over the law.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is, in this country, out of a workforce of about 20 million people, only 3.2 million are in formal employment and actually pay PAYE,\u201d Tuju\n\n. PAYE, or \u201cpay as you earn\u201d, is an income tax deducted from salaries.\n\nThere are three claims in Tuju\u2019s statement. We checked all three.\n\nAfrica Check contacted Tuju for the source of his figures. He said the 20 million he gave as the number of people in the workforce \u201cmay not be accurate to the nearest decimal point\u201d. But the figure included those \u201cin employment and the unemployed\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have our own analysis, as a party. Those are party figures,\u201d Tuju said. The context of his statement was that PAYE was at\n\nof total income. If it were raised further it would become \u201ctoo burdensome to those in formal employment\u201d.\n\nAre the party figures accurate? We turned to the most recent data from the\n\nKenya had 25 million people of working age (15 to 64) in 2015/16, according to the\n\nreleased by the statistics bureau in March 2018.\n\nOf these, 19.3 million people were\n\n\u2013 whether they were employed or unemployed.\n\n\u201d and so not part of the labour market. Reasons for this inactivity included being in school, illness and retirement. Nearly three-quarters (73.8%) of the inactive population were in school or university.\n\nTuju\u2019s claim of \u201ca workforce of about 20 million people\u201d is about the same as the 19.3 million people recorded as being in the labour market.\n\nBut the 19.3 million includes people who are unemployed. In the context of employment and taxation, we rate the claim as mostly correct.\n\nshows that of the 16.9 million people listed as employed, only 2.7 million were considered to be formally employed.\n\nOf these, 1.9 million people had jobs in the private sector and 790,200 in the public sector.\n\nTuju\u2019s figure of 3.2 million is higher than the most recent figure from the national statistics office. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect.\n\nThe report also estimated 14.1 million to be informally employed.\n\ncollects taxes for the government. PAYE is one such tax \u2013 a \u201c\n\n\u201d tax \u2013 that is taken off the salaries of people in formal employment.\n\nIf we round out 3,170,257 we get 3.2 million. Tuju\u2019s claim that \u201c3.2 million people actually pay PAYE\u201d is therefore correct.\n\nMany Kenyans outside the tax net\n\nBut many people in Kenya fall outside the tax collection net, experts told Africa Check. They included the sole proprietors of companies and their employees, said Catherine Mbogo, a partner at the\n\n. To improve national finances, more people should be \"aggressively\" brought into the tax base, Mbogo said.\n\n\"PAYE is just one kind of tax, but it\u2019s often the main topic in Kenya\u2019s public conversations about tax. This is because PAYE is easy to administer and collect,\" Maranga said.\n\nPeople in Kenya also pay tax when they buy things. Value-added tax, or VAT, is a consumer tax that contributes about the same amount to Kenya\u2019s tax kitty as PAYE.\n\nBut VAT is the tax paid by the most people.\n\n\u201cThe consumption taxes are paid by the highest proportion of people, because everyone who consumes has to pay a tax, which is factored in the final price of goods and services,\u201d Maranga said.", "lang": "en"}
