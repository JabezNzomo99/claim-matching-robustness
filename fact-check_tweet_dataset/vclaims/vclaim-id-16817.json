Could you guys please let people know this is not real?\n\nIt\u2019s natural for children to want to talk to Santa Claus when the holiday season comes around, but as of December 2016, at least one Facebook page has been that sentiment. The \u201cReal Santa Hotline,\u201d as it calls itself, is an actual phone number. But before you put your child on the phone to talk to jolly old Saint Nick, consider this: Instead of reaching the \u201cNorth Pole,\u201d callers to this \u201chotline\u201d are connected not to a kindly older man who wants to hear Christmas wishes, but to the notoriously unfriendly Westboro Baptist Church.\n\nThe number was also passed off as family-friendly by \u201csatirical\u201d publications:\n\nHowever, that is only one misleading number among several that do allow for the full Christmas experience. Heavy.com published a list in 2015 of phone numbers that actually do let you leave a message for Santa. FreeConferenceCall.com also offers its own Santa hotline, which it established in 2009.", "lang": "en"}
