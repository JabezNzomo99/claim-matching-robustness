As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebody\n\n As I try to force my desires on this person, even though I knew the time\n\n was not right and the person was not ready for it, and even though this\n\n person was me. Today I call it \u201cRESPECT\u201d. As I began to love myself I stopped craving for a different life,\n\n and I could see that everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow.\n\n Today I call it \u201cMATURITY\u201d. As I began to love myself I understood that at any circumstance,\n\n I am in the right place at the right time, and everything happens\n\n at the exactly right moment. So I could be calm.\n\n Today I call it \u201cSELF-CONFIDENCE\u201d. As I began to love myself I quit steeling my own time,\n\n and I stopped designing huge projects for the future.\n\n Today, I only do what brings me joy and happiness, things I love to do\n\n and that make my heart cheer, and I do them in my own way and in\n\n my own rhythm. Today I call it \u201cSIMPLICITY\u201d. As I began to love myself I freed myself of anything that is no good for\n\n my health \u2013 food, people, things, situations, and everything that drew\n\n me down and away from myself. At first I called this attitude\n\n a healthy egoism. Today I know it is \u201cLOVE OF ONESELF\u201d. As I began to love myself I quit trying to always be right, and ever since\n\n I was wrong less of the time. Today I discovered that is \u201cMODESTY\u201d. As I began to love myself I refused to go on living in the past and worry\n\n about the future. Now, I only live for the moment, where EVERYTHING\n\n is happening. Today I live each day, day by day, and I call it \u201cFULFILLMENT\u201d. As I began to love myself I recognized that my mind can disturb me\n\n and it can make me sick. But As I connected it to my heart, my\n\n mind became a valuable ally. Today I call this\n\n connection \u201cWISDOM OF THE HEART\u201d. We no longer need to fear arguments, confrontations or any kind of problems\n\n with ourselves or others. Even stars collide, and out of their crashing\n\n new worlds are born. Today I know THAT IS \u201cLIFE\u201d!\n\nIn addition to the numerous websites that reproduced this poem in full while attributing it to Chaplin, a few stanzas of this poem have also been used to create share-worthy memes featuring the famous actor\u2019s image:\n\nThis poem, however, was not penned by the silent-era actor. This actually appears to be an English translation of a Portuguese translation of an English-language book written by Kim and Alison McMillen.\n\nBefore we get to the somewhat convoluted origins of this poem, let\u2019s consider the fact that Charlie Chaplin, who passed away at the age of 88 in 1977, was one of the most famous actors of the silent era. In addition to his own autobiography, dozens of books have been written and movies made about his life and work. If Chaplin truly wrote this poem, we should be able to easily find a record of where and when it was originally published. Yet, we were unable to find references to Chaplin\u2019s writing of this poem in any credible source. It seems that this poem has only been attributed to Chaplin on random blogs and internet memes.\n\nAs for the poem itself, it appears to be a reworking of a selection of stanzas that were originally published in 2001 in the book \u201cWhen I Loved Myself Enough.\u201d Although the stanzas in the alleged Chaplin poem are not verbatim replicas of passages in the McMillens\u2019 book, they express familiar sentiments with similar language:\n\nWhen I loved myself enough I quit settling for too little. When I loved myself enough I came to know my own goodness. When I loved myself enough I began taking the gift of life seriously and gratefully. When I loved myself enough I began to know I was in the right place at the right time and I could relax. When I loved myself enough I felt compelled to slow down way down. And that has made all the difference.\n\nIn 2003, this book was translated into Portuguese by Iva Sofia Golcalves Lima under the title, \u201cQuando Me Amei de Verdade.\u201d That translated text was later abbreviated to a few select passages and started to spread around the internet. Here\u2019s how a portion of that text appeared in one 2005 blog post:\n\nWhen I truly loved myself, I could understand that under any circumstances I was in the right place at the right time.\n\n Then I could relax. When I truly loved myself, I realized that emotional suffering\n\n It\u2019s a sign that I\u2019m going against my truth. When I truly loved myself I stopped wishing my life was different and I started to see that everything that happens contributes\n\n for my growth.\n\nThis text continued to evolve as it was translated back into English. It\u2019s not entirely clear when Chaplin\u2019s name was first attached to the text, but it appears to have been sometime around 2007, about 30 years after the actor\u2019s death.\n\nIn sum, the poem \u201cAs I Began to Love Myself\u201d was not written by Charlie Chaplin. As far as we can tell, this poem is actually an English translation of Portuguese translation of an English language book written by Kim and Alison McMillen in 2001 entitled \u201cWhen I Loved Myself Enough.\u201d That text was then altered even further into the shareable form it consists of today. It\u2019s unclear who arranged these stanzas into their current form.", "lang": "en"}
