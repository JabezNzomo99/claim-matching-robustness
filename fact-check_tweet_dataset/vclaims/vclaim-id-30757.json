However, we found no evidence that Roker is leaving. The idea that he is leaving appears to have been generated by a confusing headline.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2020, the magazine Good Housekeeping published a story with the headline, \u201c\u2018Today\u2019 Fans Go Wild Over Al Roker\u2019s Next Big Career Move.\u201d Many read that to imply Roker was literally making a career move by changing jobs. But that\u2019s not what the story says. Instead, it reports Roker\u2019s \u201cbig career move\u201d is a new upcoming book.\n\nToday show star Al Roker is taking on a brand new project \u2014 and his fans couldn\u2019t be more thrilled for him. This past Wednesday, the beloved weather man announced during the show that he will be penning his own book of essays called You Look So Much Better in Person: True Stories of Absurdity and Success. According to Al, the new book will reveal lessons he\u2019s learned over the past 40 years working in broadcast television. The book, which will be released on June 2, will also cover his childhood in Brooklyn and Queens, what he\u2019s learned from past Today legends like Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel, and his life parenting his three kids with his wife, acclaimed journalist Deborah Roberts.\n\nBecause we found no publicly available information stating Roker was leaving the show, and because the headline of the article being shared in relation to this question appears to have been misunderstood, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
