Russia's Defense Ministry said the pilot ejected, fought with rebels on the ground and then blew himself up with a grenade as they approached him. It identified the downed pilot as Major Roman Filipov and said he had been posthumously awarded a Hero of Russia medal.\n\nIn a video statement posted Monday on the Defense Ministry\u2019s Facebook page, Col. Gen. Sergei Surovikin, Commander-in-Chief of Russian forces in Syria, said the Su-25 was \u201cflying over the Idlib de-escalation zone for controlling ceasefire regime observance.\u201d\n\nThe Conflict Intelligence Team @CITeam_en, an open-source intelligence group, challenged Surovikin\u2019s claim in a Twitter post, saying the Su-25 fired \u201dunguided air-to-surface rockets\u201d seconds before it was hit by a MANPAD (man-portable air-defense system) missile.\n\nThe @CITeam_en referred to a YouTube video of the shooting down of the Su-25 that it says is authentic.\n\n\u201cThe video was likely shot by either activists or militants from the area. It was uploaded by an activist from nearby Hama province who was in the area on February 3,\u201d Kirill Mikhailov, @CITeam_en researcher told Polygraph.info via email. The same person uploaded another video of the incident to YouTube.\n\n\u201cUnlike some other videos published at the time of the crash, it does not appear to be a video from another incident involving a different type of aircraft. In the video at 0:38, the Su-25 is likely hit, as evidenced by joyful exclamations of onlookers. The video matches the weather and plane maneuvers shown in other videos of the incident. Moreover, there are no known Su-25 shootdowns in recent conflicts that were caught on video,\u201d Mikhailov said.\n\nThe one minute and 10 second video shows two aircraft seemingly flying together until one of them changes course and disappears. At approximately 0:23, the aircraft flying solo appears to be launching airstrikes, and the sound of rockets being fired can clearly be heard in the background.\n\n\u200bAt approximately 0:38, the aircraft is likely hit by a missile: the video shows the flames coming from the jet, after which it starts trailing thick smoke and losing altitude.\n\nThe Russian air force has been accused of indiscriminate bombings in Syria that have killed thousands of civilians.\n\nAn airstrike by a Russian Su-25 occurred in the same area of Idlib province just four days before the fighter jet was shot down. That earlier attack reportedly destroyed the last remaining hospital in the area.\n\nHowever, there was no reports of the targets hit by the Su-25 on February 3. Conflict Intelligence Team\u2019s Mikhailov said: \u201cThe rockets used by the Su-25 are more of a frontline weapon and would be used to strike a military position, and such strikes are generally not reported.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
