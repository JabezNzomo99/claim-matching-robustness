Over the course of a month we wrote four different fact checks addressing the issue.\n\n\u201cGATT 24\u201d is shorthand for one of the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which sets out how member countries can agree free trade areas and customs unions with each other. It also covers the establishment of \u201cinterim\u201d agreements which lead to a permanent trade agreement.\n\nProponents of using GATT 24 often argue that the UK could continue to trade tariff-free with the EU after Brexit without signing the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by Theresa May\u2019s government, instead coming to an \u201cinterim\u201d trade agreement with the EU setting out a plan and schedule for a future trade agreement. We said such an interim agreement was unlikely to come about in practice as the EU has rejected the idea.\n\nA recent article in the Telegraph approached the GATT 24 debate from a different angle. The authors\u2014five people including Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith\u2014argue that instead of trying to sign an interim trade agreement (which would typically be quite detailed) the UK could conclude a very simple three-page free trade agreement with the EU by the end of October.\n\nThis trade agreement, they argue, would comply with GATT 24 and therefore ensure zero tariffs on trade in most goods between the UK and EU.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that such an agreement would satisfy the terms of GATT 24.\n\nBut presenting their solution as a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card that allows us to leave the EU with \u201clittle obvious\u201d change to our trade is misleading. It overlooks two key points: 1) the proposal made in the Telegraph would (contrary to the authors\u2019 claims) significantly change how we trade with the EU; and 2) the EU is very unlikely to accept such a proposal.\n\nWhat is the proposal?\n\nThe authors propose \u201ca basic 3-page Free Trade Agreement\u201d. This is one of the simplest possible trade agreements that the UK and EU could sign. Because it is compatible with GATT 24, it would allow for tariff-free trade in goods between the UK and EU, but little else.\n\nThe article misleadingly claims that \u201clittle obvious will change when we leave on October 31st this way\u201d and that it \u201cis enough to avoid delays at borders\u201d.\n\nThe article cites a one-page mock agreement drawn up by Dr Lorand Bartels, a reader in International Law at Cambridge University, as a model for a basic agreement.\n\nDr Bartels says he drafted the text as an example of the most basic deal that would satisfy GATT 24. He specifies that \u201cit does not of itself guarantee frictionless trade\u201d.\n\nSuch an agreement would only cover the issue of tariffs on trade in goods. It would not cover tariffs on trade in services, or any non-tariff barriers on any trade.\n\nTrade expert Peter Ungphakorn writes that this means a basic agreement ignores how to deal with areas \u201csuch as product standards, food safety, animal and plant health and quarantine, other regulations, mutual recognition of each other\u2019s practices for testing, approving and certifying anything from apples to accountants.\u201d\n\nIn short, under this basic agreement, differences in regulatory standards could be a major obstacle to smooth trade with the EU. It would almost certainly lead to checks and delays at the border.\n\nAdditionally, the EU is unlikely to accept this proposal. It says it is only prepared to negotiate a trade agreement with the UK once the withdrawal agreement has been passed. The European Commission has also specifically shut down the idea that it will consent to an agreement keeping tariffs at zero using GATT 24.\n\nThe question of whether an agreement is compatible with GATT 24 is a small one. It\u2019s much more important to ask what the wider implications are for our trade with the EU, and whether the EU might realistically sign up to it.", "lang": "en"}
