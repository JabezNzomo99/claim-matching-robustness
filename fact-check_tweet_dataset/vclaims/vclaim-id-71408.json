The post claims that Putin urged Africans \u201cnot to follow\u201d the World Health Organization (WHO), which has warned against untested traditional medicine. However, AFP Fact Check found no official reports from the Kremlin of any order and the Madagascan presidency denied the claims.\n\n\"I just ordered 1 million Covid19 organic drink made in Madagascar for my country, to give to Russians who are sick and contaminated with Covid19 (sic),\u201d reads the caption of a post shared more than 600 times since its publication on May 17, 2020.\n\nThe same post also claims Vladimir Putin urged Africans \u201cnot to follow the WHO so as not to fall into a hole without depth. Today, Africa has just demonstrated to the world that it is the cradle of humanity, now is Europe's turn to bow to Africa (sic).\"\n\nMadagascan President Andry Rajoelina made headlines last month when he unveiled Covid-Organics, a herbal tea derived from artemisia -- a plant with proven anti-malarial properties -- and other indigenous herbs.\n\nBut the World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly warned that the infusion, which Rajoelina has touted as a remedy against coronavirus, has not been clinically tested.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, the WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, said: \"We would caution and advise countries against adopting a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy,\" and called on Madagascar to take the drink \"through a clinical trial\".\n\nIn a televised interview on May 11, 2020, Rajoelina said the \u201cnatural, non-toxic and non-invasive\u201d remedy is \u201cpreventive and curative\u201d against COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. He stressed that \u201cthose who received the remedy Tambavi CVO noticed significant improvement only 24 hours after the administration of the first dose\u201d and \u201crecovery was observed in seven to 10 days\u201d.\n\nThe Presidency of Madagascar denied the claims\n\nMadagascan authorities have distributed the drink door to door and in schools, while countries including Senegal, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinee-Bissau, Niger, Tanzania, and the Comoros Islands all received donations.\n\nContacted by AFP Fact Check on May 14, 2020, the office of the President of Madagascar flatly denied the allegations that Putin placed an order.\n\n\u201cThe presidency of Madagascar refutes these claims,\u201d said presidential cabinet head Lova Ranoramoro. She said that \u201call inquiries\u201d about the drink were \u201cpublic\u201d.\n\nThe product cannot be \u201cordered\u201d for commercial purposes, but are \u201cdonations rather than sold internationally\u201d, she added.\n\nAFP Fact Check found no evidence of an \u201corder\u201d of Covid-Organics from Russia, which has recorded more than 350,000 cases of COVID-19 as of May 26, 2020, according to an AFP tally.\n\nAFP Fact Check found no evidence of Vladimir Putin making this statement in official Kremlin sources or major Russian news outlets.\n\nSince the outbreak of the virus late last year, Russia has repeatedly expressed its support to the WHO, unlike the criticism the organisation has received from US President Donald Trump.\n\nLast month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergue\u00ef Lavrov condemned \u201cunfair and counterproductive attacks\u201d against the WHO in a video conference with students at Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He said the United Nation\u2019s health agency \u201chandled each step of this crisis with professionalism\u201d.\n\nThe World Health Organization has pointed to a lack of scientific evidence to prove Covid-Organics's effectiveness against the new coronavirus.\n\n\u201cConcerning the medicine, our position is clear: there has been no test,\u201d Michel Yao, head of the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre at WHO Africa told AFP Fact Check on April 29, 2020. \"We encourage research, but all recommended treatments require clinical tests and trials to prove their efficacy and safety in order for it not to be detrimental to the population, which is not the case with this remedy.\u201d\n\nIn a press release on May 4, 2020, the WHO called for \u201crigorous clinical trials\u201d to evaluate potential coronavirus cures, including traditional medicine.\n\nScientists around the world are developing dozens of candidate vaccines, including 10 drugs currently in clinical evaluation.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that it comes from Africa\u201d\n\nIn a televised interview on May 11, 2020, Madagascar\u2019s president slammed sceptics, saying, \u201cIf Europeans had found this remedy, would it be challenged? I highly doubt it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt comes from Africa, and that is the problem. They can't accept that a country like Madagascar, the 163rd poorest country in the world, came up with a formula to save the world,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
