NewsTrend's Facebook page has over 41 lakh followers. Its parent company is based out of Khairar, Odisha.\n\nIn March 2016 Bansal replied to a question on Quora, a public forum, about the biggest group on Facebook.\n\nAt the time Bansal replied, \"The biggest group of facebook is \"WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI\" group. It's having nearly one million members and it is highly active. It may be the most active group of facebook.\"\n\nAmong the group's list of housekeeping rules, it also spells out that its members are not paid by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but are offering their time online voluntarily.\n\nA disclaimer says members are not paid workers of the BJP\n\nThe group is moderated by 3 admins and 53 moderators. \n\nDespite the disclaimer, at least three moderators, according to their Facebook profiles are linked to the BJP -- one a member of the party, while two others were associated with the party's social media operations.\n\nMukul Jain's Facebook's intro says he works for BJP's IT and social media. Jain's bio also states he manages three Facebook pages (Bharatiya Jeevan, We Support Namo and Deshi Vikas)\n\n\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u091c\u0935\u093e\u0928, We Support Namo and \u0926\u0947\u0936\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0936\n\nJain's page 'We Support Namo' with a following of over 1,80,000 is a purveyor of fake quotes targeting Muslims, liberals and critics of the government. The quotes from the page are made in the same template.\n\nFake quotes are a menace in India and their origins have been hard to trace. But the below examples show that they might be pumped online in a synchronised blast.\n\nSameer Sachdeva, another moderator of the group 'WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI' posted a fake quote attributed to Ravish Kumar, a news anchor at NDTV Hindi, on April 10, 2019 at 09:11 am.\n\nThe same fake quote was separately posted by 'We Support Namo', the page run by moderator Mukul Jain, four minutes later at 09:15 am.\n\nSame fake quote shared by the page 'We Support Namo' at 09:15\n\nAnother example shows the page 'We Support Namo' posting a fake quote of actor-turned-politician Prakash Raj on March 30, 2019 at 07:57 and the same quote posted by Sachdeva to the group WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI at 07:58.\n\nA fake quote shared by the page 'We Support Namo'\n\nFake quote attributed to Prakash Raj shared in the 'WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI' group\n\nThe actor himself called out the fake quote in January, on Twitter.\n\nSameer Sachdeva, whose profile only reveals he studied at Gujarat University, was also responsible for sharing fake quotes falsely attributed to actors Kangana Ranaut and Shabana Azmi among others.\n\nShailendra Kumar is also one of the seven admins listed on 'Zee news fans club' another Facebook page that shares fake news.\n\nKumar's Gmail ID is listed in the About section of the page 'Zee news fans club' which often shares communally charged fake news.\n\nShailendra Kumar - One of the group moderators\n\nIn January 'Zee news fans club' posted a riot video from Bangladesh claiming it was West Bengal. That post has been shared nearly eight thousand times. Read the fact-check here.\n\nIn the same month, the page posted a horrific video from Bangladesh showing a group of men crushing a man to death with a large stone while falsely claiming Muslims in West Bengal killed a Hindu. The video was debunked by Alt News in April 2017.\n\n\n\nA full list of the group's moderators can be accessed here.\n\n\"No more associated with that group\": Manish Bansal\n\nWhen BOOM reached out to Manish Bansal, one of the co-creators of the group, he responded saying he was no longer associated with the group and that it was created by Basant Sethia and run by him and his team now. \n\n\n\n\"However, I am no more associated with that group' We SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI' from last 1 year,\" Bansal told BOOM.\n\n\"When a controversy arises with my name I left that group, even I am not a member of that Group. I'm also under the profession of journalism so I Seriously understand this issue,\" he added.\n\nHowever, the group's description was updated removing Bansal's name as 'Group Admin' after BOOM reached out to him. It still lists him as one of the creators of the group.\n\nAn updated description of the group\n\n\n\n'Detecting all fake news at first instance not possible': Basant Sethia\n\nWhen BOOM reached out to Basant Sethia, a co-creator of the group and now its chief admin, he said detecting fake news at first instance was not possible because of the huge number of posts, sometimes going up to six thousand in a day.\n\nFollowing our query, Sethia claimed posting to the group had been temporarily disabled.\n\n\"As on now, we have temporarily disabled posting to this group, to detect and delete the fake stories posted on this group,\" Sethia told BOOM in an email.\n\n\"We will do our best to stop this and block those members who posted these fake news as we dont want to give platform of our group to them.\"\n\nBOOM has also reached out to Amit Malviya, in-charge of BJP's national Information & Technology. The story will be updated upon receiving a reply.\n\n\n\nOn April 1, 2019, ten days before the country went to the polls, Facebook said it was cracking down on hundreds of pages, groups and accounts in India for 'coordinated inauthentic behaviour'. (Read about it here and here)\n\nFacebook defines \u2018coordinated inauthentic behaviour\u2019 as \u2018groups of people or pages working together to mislead others about who they are and what they do\u2019.\n\nBut our investigation shows ridding the platform of fake news is not going to be a one-time effort.\n\nBOOM is one of Facebook's third-party fact-checking partners in India.\n\nBelow are 20 recent examples of fake news posted on the group. \n\n\n\n1.
