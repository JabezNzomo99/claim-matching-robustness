These are headcount figures and count the number of individuals rather than full-time equivalent figures which would give an indication of the hours these staff worked.\n\nThese figures don\u2019t tell us anything about why these nurses left the NHS and we can\u2019t say whether or not they left the UK altogether. They also include staff who may only leave temporarily, for instance those on a career break or maternity leave.\n\nThe information about where a staff member is from is self-reported\u2014meaning that it could refer to their country of birth, their citizenship or their cultural heritage.\n\nAlthough we can\u2019t say anything about the reasons why these particular EU nurses left the NHS, we do know something about the reasons why nurses (of all nationalities) left in the year to June 2017.\n\nAround 49% of these nurses resigned voluntarily and of these about half said it was because they were \u2018relocating\u2019\u2014although there are no details on where they went. For most of the other 51% of nurses, we don\u2019t even know their reason for leaving.\n\nThe number of nurses and health visitors reporting UK nationality leaving the NHS in England has outweighed the number of those joining in each year since September 2013. But there have been more nurses and health visitors from the rest of the world joining the NHS than leaving it since September 2015.\n\nSince January 2016 all nurses applying to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) from the EU have been required to sit an English language test. In order to practice in the UK a nurse or midwife must be registered with the NMC.\n\nNurses from the EU or European Economic Area (EEA) must have reached a certain score in the required English language tests to register with the NMC, this can be either the International English Language Test System (IELTS) or the Occupational English Test (OET).\n\nAlternatively they can register if their nursing qualification was undertaken and examined in English or they have worked for at least one year in a country where English is the first language and were assessed on their English there. These alternative options and the OET test were introduced in November last year.\n\nThe same English language requirements must also be provided by nurses from outside the EU/EEA when they register with the NMC. Versions of these requirements have been in place since 2005.\n\nHealth think tank, the King\u2019s Fund, cites the introduction of the new English language test as one possible reason for the sharp reduction in the number of nurses from the EU joining the NMC register, along with the result of the EU referendum in 2016. It says \u201cThis fall is not driven solely by the vote itself (new English language requirements were also introduced in 2016 for example), but just as with the Francis report, the timing is hard to ignore.\u201d\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing has said that evidence suggests \u201cthe challenge facing international recruitment in the UK stems in part from a weakening of the overall EEA supply, which is being driven by complex factors including Brexit, worsening conditions for the UK nursing workforce as well as improved economic prospects in the EEA. While IELTS may not be helping this situation, it is unlikely to be the root cause.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
