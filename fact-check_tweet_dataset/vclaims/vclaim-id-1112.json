This tweet is untrue.\n\nSome examples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nThe claim comes after reports of TikTok users and fans of Korean pop music taking partial credit for inflating attendance expectations for Trump\u2019s first rally in months ( here ).\n\nPosts include an image of an apparent tweet sent from Trump\u2019s official account on June 21, 2020. The full tweet reads: \u201cAnyone who ordered a ticket to my rally and didn\u2019t attend should be arrested and face very powerful charges. #treason\u201d.\n\nThere is no evidence to show the tweet is legitimate. It does not appear on Trump\u2019s timeline on June 21, nor does it appear in Twitter searches for posts with this wording. No news outlets reported that Trump tweeted this on June 21.\n\nAccording to Politwoops, a project by ProPublica that archives deleted tweets from politicians, the tweet has also not been deleted from his page ( here ).\n\nOn June 15, Trump did tweet about one million people having allegedly requested tickets for the Tulsa rally, which occurred on Saturday, June 20 ( here ).\n\nThen on June 19, he called for protesters \u201crip[ing] down\u201d statues to be \u201cimmediately arrested\u201d ( here ).\n\nReuters recently debunked other fictitious tweets attributed to Trump ( here and here ).\n\nFalse. Trump tweet calling for the arrest of ticketholders who did not attend his Tulsa rally is fabricated.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
