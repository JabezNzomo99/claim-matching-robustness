The results were declared on August 4. News18 reported that two candidates from North Kashmir\u2019s Kupwara district, Nadia Beig and Aftab Rasool, also cleared the exams. Two days later, several Facebook and Twitter users claimed that Beig\u2019s Twitter account is full of \u201canti-national activities\u201d. This was based on tweets by a Twitter account \u2018@Nadia_Beigh\u2019 which no longer exists. These screenshots below have been widely shared on social media.\n\nTwitter account @kapilverma73 posted a tweet-thread on the matter. He referred to Beig\u2019s alleged social media activity and questioned her \u201cloyalty\u201d to the nation. In one of his tweets he wrote, \u201cHer one step can ruin our nation\u2019s relationship with any nation, and a woman who has Pakistani ideology, won\u2019t she have a soft corner for Pakistan?

This tweet-thread gained over 15,000 likes and more than 9,000 retweets cumulatively. (archived link)\n\n\n\nSimilarly, other Twitter users also promoted the same claim (1, 2, 3). One of them wrote, \u201cI had saved her tweets because I knew she will delete her account.\u201d\n\nOn August 3, a news website Samachar24x7 published a similar report with the headline \u2014 \u201cHow will Nadia Beig work as an IAS officer with her anti-national mindset? Will UPSC answer to the country?\u2019 (archived link)\n\nAlt News has received several requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAt first glance, we noticed that Twitter account @Nadia_Beigh spells Nadia\u2019s last name incorrectly. Nadia\u2019s last name is spelt as \u2018Beig\u2019 on the UPSC results. The screenshot below is from the UPSC\u2019s official website.\n\nOn August 4, @decibel008 tweeted a screenshot of a 2017 tweet by @Nadia_Beigh which shows a man\u2019s picture with the hashtag #NewProfilePic.\n\nTwitter user @@decibel008 also shared a screen recording of the now-deleted account where, at the 9-second mark, another picture of the same man is visible.\n\nBut the information that irrefutably establishes that @Nadia_Beigh is a fake account is that the handle\u2019s previous username was @IndolentUser. This is can be spotted at 18 seconds into the screen recording.\n\nEvery Twitter account has a unique numeric ID which does not change even if the username is altered. The section below explains how we found that @Nadia_Beigh and @IndolentUser have the same numeric ID.\n\nStep 1: Alt News found archived tweets of @Nadia_Beigh and @IndolentUser on Wayback Machine, a digital archive of the world wide web founded by a US-based Internet Archive. As per the archived tweets of @IndolentUser, the username belongs to \u2018Nayeem\u2019.\n\n\n\nStep 2: We accessed HTML source codes of the archived web pages of @Nadia_Beigh\u2019s tweet on August 4 and @IndolentUser\u2019s tweet on July 25. The HTML source code can be viewed by right-clicking on the website, then selecting \u2018View Page Source\u2019 as shown below.\n\n\n\nStep 3: We performed a keyword search using the syntax \u2018data-user-id\u2019 on the respective source pages (@Nadia_Beigh and @IndolentUser) and found that both Twitter users have the same numeric Twitter ID \u20181860799123\u2019.\n\nThus, @Nadia_Beigh was an imposter account of Kashmiri woman Nadia Beig who cracked the 2019 UPSC examinations. The account was believed be to authentic by several social media users including Congress member Salman Nizami (archived link).", "lang": "en"}
