Rick Scott and Charlie Crist are competing for the Hispanic vote, leading the candidates to argue about their stances on everything from the Cuba embargo to rights for illegal immigrants.\n\nDuring the Telemundo debate Oct. 10, the debate moderator asked the candidates to explain their conflicting views on driver\u2019s licenses for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children.\n\nIn 2013, the Legislature passed a bill to give driver licenses to those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, sometimes called \"Dreamers.\" Scott vetoed it.\n\nCrist, a Democrat, said during the debate: \"I\u2019m in favor of a driver\u2019s license for Dreamers. The governor recently signed a bill where they can have in-state tuition. And that was a good thing to do. But if you can\u2019t drive to school, or you can\u2019t drive to your job, good luck getting to work.\"\n\nScott, a Republican, responded: \"The driver\u2019s license bill that was passed, nothing changed. Those same individuals have the right to get a Florida driver\u2019s license today.\"\n\nScott was partially correct and partially misleading. Floridians who get Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, called DACA, generally get work permits, which they can use to get driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nBut he is overstating the situation when he says \"nothing changed,\" because that bill would have affirmatively given those immigrants the right to use their DACA forms to get a driver\u2019s license, even if their work permit didn\u2019t arrive simultaneously.\n\nIn 2012, Obama announced DACA, which allows illegal immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation, as long as they can prove they are law abiding and meet other requirements. As of the end of June 2014, about 580,000 individuals nationwide received initial deferred action including 23,196 in Florida.\n\nIn 2013, Florida lawmakers proposed HB 235. The proposal would allow Dreamers to use their new federal status as a way to obtain a temporary driver license.\n\nA Florida House analysis said that without the law, Dreamers would first have to receive an employment authorization card before they could receive a temporary driver license.\n\nIn April 2013, the Florida bill sailed through unanimously in the Senate and with only two \"no\" votes in the House. Scott vetoed the bill June 4, 2013.\n\nIn his veto message, Scott bashed the Obama administration for implementing DACA and then argued that the bill was unnecessary:\n\n\"Already, Florida law allows those with a federal employment authorization card, without regard to their deferred action status, to obtain a temporary Florida driver license. Although the Legislature may have been well intentioned in seeking to expedite the process to obtain a temporary driver license, it should not have been done by relying on a federal government policy adopted without legal basis.\"\n\nPolitiFact Florida asked spokespersons for Scott\u2019s office and campaign to explain his evidence that the bill would not have changed anything and if that was the case why he bothered vetoing it. The only response we received was a copy of Scott\u2019s veto.\n\nDemocrats and immigrant rights\u2019 groups criticized Scott\u2019s veto and characterized it as a blow to Hispanics.\n\nBut some news reports characterized Scott\u2019s driver license veto as largely symbolic since immigrants could still get a driver license with the federal work permit.\n\nThe ACLU of Florida, which criticized Scott\u2019s veto, sent a letter to the state Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles stating \"the veto should have no impact on DHSMV\u2019s current practice of granting driver\u2019s licenses to current DACA recipients who have employment authorization.\"\n\nFederal immigration officials told PolitiFact Florida that people apply for DACA and the work permit at the same time and nearly everyone gets both.\n\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Service approved 591,555 requests for DACA between Aug. 15, 2012 and July 31, 2014.\n\nDuring the same period, the agency denied 635 applications for work permits. Potential reasons include failing to sign the forms or provide property documentation.\n\nMost of the immigration law experts we interviewed said that generally applicants get DACA and work permits at the same time, though some had heard anecdotes about people who got their DACA days, weeks or months before the work permit.\n\nSince such a delay could occur, the Legislature wanted to give these immigrants the right to use DACA to get their driver\u2019s licenses as quickly as possible.\n\n\"It was basically to give those folks an opportunity to get their driver\u2019s license right away,\" bill sponsor state Rep. Randolph Bracy, D-Orlando, told PolitiFact Florida. \"Sometimes they get their approval letter and work permit at the same time but sometimes they don\u2019t. It was just a show of support toward the Dreamers and said \u2018we are behind you.\u2019 \"\n\nScott said that \"nothing changed\" for certain illegal immigrants to get driver licenses in a bill he vetoed.\n\nThere was a change in the bill: It would have affirmatively stated that immigrants with DACA approval could use that documentation to get driver\u2019s licenses. Scott vetoed the bill, so immigrants don\u2019t have that right.\n\nHowever, applicants for DACA simultaneously apply for a work permit and generally get their approvals around the same time. If Scott hadn\u2019t vetoed the bill, it would have meant that those who get DACA first wouldn\u2019t have to wait for their work permit, although it is sometimes a short wait.\n\nThe claim is partially accurate in that immigrants who get DACA will likely get a work permit and they can use that work permit to get the driver\u2019s license. However, Scott exaggerated when he said \"nothing changed\" in the bill he vetoed.\n\nEditor's note: This report initially appeared with conflicted rulings.
