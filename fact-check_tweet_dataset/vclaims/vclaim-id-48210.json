(mutation) and convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells.\"\n\n\"The virus CANNOT go through healthy skin\"\n\n\"UV LIGHT on any object that may contain it breaks down the virus protein. For example, to disinfect and reuse a mask is perfect. Be careful, it also breaks down collagen (which is protein) in the skin, eventually causing wrinkles and skin cancer.\"\n\nThe message in its entirety can be seen below. The post below is an example of the list being shared by many users of Facebook.\n\nA PDF version of this message can be found here, and is circulating on WhatsApp.\n\nJHU has been disseminating a lot of information around the coronavirus and COVID-19. It runs a popular and a regularly-updated COVID-19 tracker to track cases and deaths around the world. The university is also offering insights and trends derived from data from the tracker, as well as medical and social guidelines around the coronavirus and infectious diseases.\n\nFor starters, the university has denied the viral content through a tweet on March 28, calling it false.\n\nThrough a blog post on April 4, the university then wrote, \"The message, which has no identifiable connection to Johns Hopkins, includes approximately 20 bullet points, the first of which begins \"The virus is not a living organism \u2026 .\" It is sometimes attributed to a Johns Hopkins doctor, or immunologist, or to 'Irene Ken, whose daughter is an Asst. Prof in infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University'\", says the blog. The blog has also advised peopled to get their news and information from trustworthy sources such as the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Infections or from reputable news outlets.\n\nUS-based fact-checking website, Snopes, has carried this story too, labelling it as 'misattributed' with a statement from JHU. A spokesperson of the university told Snopes, \"This is not something produced by Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM). We have seen rumors and misinformation about COVID-19 citing our experts and circulating on social media, and we have received several inquiries from the general public about these posts. We do not know their origin, and they lack credibility.\"\n\nAlso Read: Did An American CEO Draw This Map To Praise Indian Govt.'s COVID-19 Response?", "lang": "en"}
