This is false.\n\nExamples of the posts can be seen (here , here , here and here).\n\nIn the video Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO\u2019s technical lead on the coronavirus pandemic, is heard saying: \u201cFrom the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onwards to a secondary individual\u201d.\n\nThis clip is paired with a caption that claims the WHO has made \u201ca complete U turn\u201d and now advises that coronavirus patients don\u2019t need to be isolated or quarantined. It also claims that the organisation has said social distancing is not needed because the virus cannot transmit from one patient to another.\n\nWhile Kerkhove did make the comment in the video, current WHO guidelines maintain that COVID-19 is a contagious disease that should be treated as such.\n\n\u201cPeople can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks\u201d, the WHO explains on its coronavirus Q&A webpage(here).\n\nBecause of this, the WHO recommends social distancing of at least 1 metre even between people who are \u201cwell with no known exposure to COVID-19\" (here).\n\nThe WHO defines isolation as separating people who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms, while quarantine is \u201crestricting activities or separating people\u201d who are not ill themselves but may have been exposed to the virus. The health body states that both isolation and quarantine are important measures to avoid infecting others (here).\n\nAccording to WHO guidelines, while current evidence suggests that most transmission happens from people with symptoms to others in close contact, there is also the \u201cpossibility of transmission from people who are infected and shedding virus but have not yet developed symptoms\u201d, which is called pre-symptomatic transmission (here).\n\nCrucially, the guidance goes on to acknowledge that \u201csome people infected with the COVID-19 virus do not ever develop any symptoms, although they can shed virus which may then be transmitted to others\u201d. These people are considered asymptomatic.\n\nAfter her remark on \u201crare\u201d asymptomatic transmission came under scrutiny, Kerkhove said that she had been misunderstood and that she was referring to a certain \u201csubset of studies\u201d.\n\n\u201cI used the phrase \u2018very rare,\u2019 and I think that that\u2019s misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. What I was referring to was a subset of studies,\u201d Kerkhove said during a Q&A session on June 9, 2020. \u201cI was responding to a question at the press conference. I wasn\u2019t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that, I was just trying to articulate what we know.\u201d(here)\n\nShe said that while the majority of the transmissions are from people that have symptoms, there are a subset of people who don\u2019t develop symptoms, but to \u201ctruly understand how many people don\u2019t have symptoms, we don\u2019t actually have that answer yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we do know that some people who are asymptomatic or people who don\u2019t have symptoms can transmit the virus on,\u201d she added.\n\nFalse. The World Health Organization has not said that social distancing, quarantine or isolation is not needed to combat the spread of COVID-19. Nor has it said the virus is not transmitted from person to person.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact checking work (here).", "lang": "en"}
