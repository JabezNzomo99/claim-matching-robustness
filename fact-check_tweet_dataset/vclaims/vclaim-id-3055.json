Also, Patrick's district-specific mandate didn't make it into a legislative proposal.\n\nAs noted in an email we fielded from Patrick campaign spokesman Allen Blakemore, on July 13, 2017, Patrick made a 34-minute presentation to reporters about legislation he expected the Republican-controlled Senate to advance during a looming 30-day special session called by Gov. Greg Abbott, who\u2019d said the month before that he\u2019d seek action to raise teacher salaries by $1,000 each, an idea that didn\u2019t pass into law.\n\nPatrick, pointing out that he\u2019d previously chaired the Senate Education Committee, called public education the \"most important thing we do.\" He also noted that 52 percent of available state revenue gets allocated to public and higher education, a claim we later found Mostly True. Education also accounts for the smallest share of budgeted state spending in at least 20 years.\n\nPatrick called for lawmakers to direct school districts to shift more budgeted funds to teacher salaries.\n\n\"I want the school districts, one of my goals, and it needs to be the goal of the Legislature to direct this,\" to \"increase the amount of money they\u2019re spending by 5 percent over the next four years on teachers,\" Patrick said. That move, he said, would drive up the state\u2019s average teacher salary from more than $51,000 to $60,000.\n\n\"Many teachers will make much more, some will make less,\" Patrick said. \"But they all would get about an $8,000 increase if we just take 5 percent of the money that schools are getting. Remember, there\u2019s a lot of room here, there\u2019s a lot of room here. The dollars are in the system.\"\n\nPatrick continued: \"Now some will say, well, that\u2019s an unfunded mandate. That\u2019s not true. That\u2019s not what the governor is talking about. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. We\u2019re simply saying prioritize the money for the teachers. If we\u2019re going to have a great education system, we have to attract more teachers to the system, the best and brightest.\"\n\nIn response to a question that day, Patrick said it would be up to districts to decide which budgeted dollars to shift to teacher pay. Patrick also said his plan would be offered as legislation by Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nNelson, legislative records show, subsequently carried Senate Bill 19 through the Senate. A revised version of the proposal later died in the House.\n\nYet it looks to us like Patrick\u2019s pay-raise directive didn\u2019t make it into SB 19.\n\nNelson\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to our inquiries about that. But in her initial filed version of the proposal, introduced July 20, 2017, the \"Classroom Teacher Salary Increases\" section called only for each district to increase teacher salaries by spending $1,000 more per teacher from available funds in a manner determined by the local school board. That amount aligned with Abbott's expressed desire.\n\nTwo days later, the Nelson-led panel advanced SB 19 to the Senate after representatives of teacher groups testified that they couldn't fully support the plan because the envisioned raises weren\u2019t accompanied by more state aid, the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time. \"According to Nelson's office,\" the newspaper said, \"the Legislature next session will have to decide how to pay for the bill's $750 million pay raise provision, which wouldn't take effect until the 2019-2020 school year,\" the story said.\n\nNelson reportedly told teacher groups in response: \"It\u2019s this or nothing.\"\n\nIn the end, records show, the $1,000 raise language was no longer in SB 19 when the Senate advanced it to the House, though the revised legislation kept alive language stating that subject to available funding, the Texas Education Agency shall provide annual bonuses to classroom teachers based on years of experience--which Patrick also had offered as an idea in his presentation. A later version of SB 19, as amended and advanced by a House panel, had no provisions for raises or bonuses.\n\nAccording to news reports, the initial bonuses were to be funded by lawmakers delaying Medicaid managed-care payments for two years though Patrick favored sending voters a proposed constitutional amendment to allocate money for the bonuses from state lottery revenues.\n\nLottery revenue was already dedicated to school funding.\n\nBut Senate Joint Resolution 1, introduced July 20, 2017 by Sen. Konni Burton, R-Fort Worth, called for requiring half of revenues generated by the lottery for education to be used to pay for salary increases and bonuses for classroom teachers with at least six years of experience and related retirement contributions, according to its fiscal note. \"As a result, school districts would have less available revenue to fund all other operations,\" the fiscal note states. Records show a Senate committee held a hearing on the proposal, which wasn\u2019t sent to the full Senate. A related measure, SB 97 by Sen. Charles Perry, R-Lubbock, also didn't advance.\n\nTom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials, among advocates for school employees responding to our inquiry about Patrick\u2019s claim, said of SB 19: \"A bonus is not a pay raise.\" Canby noted too that the legislation\u2019s specified bonus amounts--$600 or $1,000, based on years of experience--fell short of Patrick\u2019s envisioned $10,000.\n\nLonnie Hollingsworth, Jr., of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association offered us his calculation indicating that if districts had been required to set aside 5 percent of operating expenditures in the 2016-2017 school year to boost teacher salaries, the resulting raises would average $6,708. \"Theoretically, it would be possible to increase teacher salaries by requiring districts to reallocate existing funding,\" Hollingsworth said by email, \"but we have never seen a mechanism that would accomplish this. Our preferred approach is for increased state funding with a requirement for a commensurate increase in teacher salaries.\"\n\nClay Robison of the Texas State Teachers Association similarly emphasized by email that Patrick didn\u2019t call for state aid to pay for raises. Mark Wiggins, a lobbyist for the Association for Texas Professional Educators, said by email that \"legislation to give teachers a $10,000 raise was never even filed.\"\n\nPatrick said: \"Last year, I proposed directing more of the education budget to teacher salaries, a move that would have resulted in an average $10,000 raise for teachers.\"\n\nPatrick made no proposal to direct more of the state's education budget to teacher salaries. Rather, he told reporters that lawmakers should tell school districts to set aside more money for such salaries by reducing other expenditures. That idea, which Patrick said would boost the average salary by $8,000, never got written into a legislative proposal.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
