And are they rounding up 200,000 troops to get the job done? Nope, that's not true: this story was invented by a military satire weblog and has no connection to reality.\n\nIt appeared as an article published on March 29, 2018 by Duffel Blog titled \"Army calls for 200,000-man detail to fill sandbags on US-Mexico border\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nEL PASO, Texas -- The U.S. Army's top enlisted man has been seen walking around a number of U.S. Army installations in an attempt to round up at least 200,000 soldiers for a detail on the U.S.-Mexico border, sources confirmed today. According to a number of sources at Fort Bliss, Sgt. Maj. of the Army Daniel Dailey was seen screaming in the parking lots of various barracks for \"a couple hundred thousand bodies.\" \"Hey get me some soldiers out here right now!\" screamed Dailey outside barracks belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team of 1st Armored Division on Tuesday, according to witnesses. \"I need a detail on the border. This one's important, people.\" Dailey has been attempting to rally hundreds of thousands of soldiers for a detail filling sandbags and Hesco barriers on the southwestern border of the United States, after President Donald Trump privately indicated he wanted the military to pay for the much-talked about wall that Congress wouldn't pay for that Mexico was supposed to pay for.\n\nThe story looked believable enough if you squint a bit and only saw the summary on social media:\n\nWe wrote about duffelblog.com before because sometimes their humorous satire gets mistaken for real news by people who don't know anything about military matters:\n\u2022 Fake News: Pentagon Is NOT Partnering With Uber For On-demand Helicopter Extraction\n\u2022 Fake News: Military NOT Drawing Up Plans For Nationwide Gun Confiscations\n\u2022 Fake News: Corps' Top Leaders Did NOT Warn Marines To Stop Eating Tide Pods\n\u2022 Fake News: Army's new 'Holistic Medics' Do NOT Treat Gunshot Wounds With Crystals, Essential Oils\n\u2022 Fake News: Saudi Arabia Did NOT Behead First Female Robot Citizen\n\nThe website Duffelblog.com is a military-themed satire website which sports following legal disclaimer on its 'about' page:\n\nWe are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet.
