Accompanying the image is a story of how the children of the Buckley family killed their mother on Halloween.\n\nThe photograph has been doctored. The original image shows a normal family portrait, minus the axe and with everyone\u2019s heads attached.\n\nThe image was altered by an artist, Edward Allen, who calls his version \u201cMidwestern Matricide\u201d. He sells copies of it on a website that specialises in \u201cspooky changing portraits based on antique photographs\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
