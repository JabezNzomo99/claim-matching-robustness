We checked.\n\nWe contacted Yatani to ask for the source of his claim and will update this report with his response. He\n\nAfrica Check that certain tax relief measures had missed their target.\n\n\u201cSometimes we give concessions in terms of tax exemptions and the benefits are not passed on to the intended beneficiaries,\u201d he said in May 2020 when\n\nthat the country has since 2010 missed its revenue targets.\n\nAccording to the IMF, Kenya\u2019s\n\ntax expenditures were KSh478 billion in 2017. As a share of its\n\nGDP that year, these came to 5.9% \u2013 close to the minister\u2019s figure.\n\nWhat are tax expenditures?\n\n\n\n Tax expenditures are \u201ca government\u2019s estimated revenue loss that results from giving tax concessions or preferences to a taxpayer or activity\u201d. This is according to the , an organisation that focuses on the spending of public funds. \n\n\n\n on fiscal transparency in Kenya, the said tax expenditures were \u201cprovisions of tax law, regulations, or practices that reduce or postpone revenue for certain taxpayers relative to a benchmark tax\u201d. \n\n\n\n exemptions from taxation, reductions in the amount owed, reduced tax rates and delays in paying tax. \n\n\n\n But there is little data on expenditures in Kenya, as it \u201cdoes not publish any regular report that comprehensively discloses the estimated revenue losses from tax expenditures\u201d, the IMF said. \n\n\n\n\n\n The Kenya Revenue Authority reports on tax concessions to the , but this is not published \u201cconcerns over the reliability of the data\u201d. \n\n\n\n said it was \u201cdifficult to make a conclusive judgment about the considerations that go into providing tax incentives in Kenya\u201d as they were not clearly recorded.\n\nIs there a global \u2018standard\u2019 for tax expenditures?\n\nWe asked several experts if there was a standard or even average for tax expenditures.\n\nat the Center for Global Development (CGD), a US-based think tank, who previously worked in public finance at the IMF.\n\nHe told Africa Check was no international standard for tax expenditures. \u201cThere is no such rule \u2014 the numbers are all over the place.\u201d\n\nHe said he also did not know of a standard for tax breaks. \u201cAs far as I know, there's no unique and agreed standard or limit for what the overall size of tax expenditures should be.\u201d\n\n(ICTD) in the UK. She told us that while she could not speak directly to the cabinet secretary\u2019s claim, she was not aware of a recommended standard.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a generally agreed level of tax expenditures as a share of GDP that is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018optimal\u2019.\u201d\n\nSo what do countries spend on tax expenditures?\n\nDe Renzio said he \u201cwould agree with the cabinet secretary that levels between 2% and 3% of GDP are very common across countries\u201d, as shown in his data.\n\n, is preparing a global database on tax expenditures that should be complete by the end of 2020.\n\nHe said 17 African countries publish this data, with tax expenditures ranging from 0.6% of GDP for the Republic of Congo to 7.8% for Senegal. Kenya is not in the database as it does not publish information on tax breaks.\n\nThe average tax expenditures for the 17 countries is 2.9% of GDP \u2013 although this isn\u2019t necessarily the full picture.\n\n, the CGD\u2019s Gupta said tax concessions were 5% of GDP or more for a third of 34 countries listed.\n\nVon Haldenwang cautioned against using the 2.9% figure as an average.\n\n\u201cI would be reluctant to take this average or any other figure as a standard, let alone a good practice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo start with, tax expenditures are always deviations from a benchmark tax system, and since every country has its own individual tax system, deviations from them are also highly case-specific.\u201d\n\nthat tax concessions were \u201cnot comparable\u201d as different countries calculated them differently.\n\nWhat are the benefits of tax breaks?\n\nMinister Yatani was on surer footing when he said the cost of tax concessions outweighed their benefit.\n\ngenerally true\u201d that many African and low-income countries granted more incentives they should, the\n\n\u201cOften incentives are provided in a way that is not transparent or based on a clear economic rationale, and therefore represent a revenue loss that might not have a clear justification.\n\nGupta told Africa Check that countries should look to minimise these exemptions as they are often discretionary and outside the budgeting process.\n\n\u201cThey are decided and agreed upon by parliament, without due regard to their effect on tax revenue,\u201d he\n\n. He added that they were often abused.\n\n\u201cCompanies that operate within the tax-break window often close and move to different jurisdictions just before the full tax rate comes into effect, or frequently change names and start enjoying the tax holiday afresh as a new entity.\u201d\n\nConclusion: No \u2018standard\u2019 for tax expenditure \u2013 2% of GDP or otherwise\n\nAhead of his June 2020 budget, Kenya\u2019s treasury cabinet secretary Ukur Yatani said tax breaks would be rolled back because they reduced government revenue.\n\nThe cost of concessions in \u201ctax expenditures\u201d for the treasury was about 6% of Kenya\u2019s GDP, way more than the 2% \u201cstandard\u201d, he said.\n\nExperts told Africa Check there wasn\u2019t a global standard for tax expenditures. Tax concessions can\u2019t be compared across countries, so an average would be meaningless.\n\nKenya is one of many countries that do not publish data on tax expenditure. The International Monetary Fund has urged the country to do this to make its budget more transparent.", "lang": "en"}
