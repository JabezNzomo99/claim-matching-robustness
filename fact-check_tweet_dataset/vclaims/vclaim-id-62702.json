The claim is false, this photo has circulated online since at least 2015; Telangana\u2019s chief minister has announced it will not distribute Ramadan gifts this year due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe photo was shared in this Facebook post on May 12, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cTelangana government is distributing free gifts to Muslims during Ramzan. They didn\u2019t do the same during Hindu festivals.\u201d\n\nTelangana is a state in south India, governed by chief minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao.\n\nRamzan is another word for Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, recognised as the holy month of fasting.\n\nThe image was shared alongside a similar claim here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo has circulated in media reports since at least 2015. The Telangana state government has said it will not hold its annual Ramadan gifting event while the nationwide coronavirus lockdown is in place.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the same photo published in this July 9, 2016 report by the Indian news website Aajtak.\n\nThe Hindi-language headline translates to English as: \u201cTelangana government to distribute gifts to nearly 2 million poor Muslim families in Ramadan\u201d.\n\nIt reads, in part: \u201cThe Telangana government has made special preparations to make this Ramadan memorable for the poor Muslims of the state. The government will distribute gifts to 1.95 poor Muslim families of the state.\u201d\n\nThe event was also reported by other local media, including The Hindu here and iChowk.in here.\n\nThis year, chief minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao announced there will be no such packages distributed to Muslims for Ramadan, as the nationwide lockdown over the novel coronavirus continues.\n\nAt the one-hour 39-minute mark of this video posted to the Telangana local government\u2019s official Facebook page on May 5, 2020, he says: \u201cAs people will touch the bags with their hands and there is a chance for coronavirus to spread, government will not be distributing Ramzan gifts for this year.\u201d\n\nTelangana has also previously distributed \u2018gifts\u2019 in a similar manner to mark other religious festivals, such as Christmas and Bathukamma, the Hindu festival of flowers.\n\nLocal media reports from 2019, including this article by the Times of India and this by Hindustan Times shows hundreds aid packages were distributed on Christmas and Bathukamma celebrations by the state government that year.", "lang": "en"}
