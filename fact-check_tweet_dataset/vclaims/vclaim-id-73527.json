Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: The woman in the video is not Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s daughter. The woman in the photo is Natalya. She is one of the volunteers who got vaccinated in the trials conducted in Russia. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, many videos with similar visuals were found in the search results. A similar video was uploaded by a Russian Channel on YouTube in July 2020. In the description, it was written that the group of volunteers were discharged from Burdenko Main Military Clinical Hospital after the vaccine trial.\n\nThe image of the same woman (the earrings are same) can be also found in an article published by \u2018Zvezda\u2019 (a Russian state-owned nationwide TV network run by the Russian Ministry of Defence) in June 2020. On 13 July 2020, \u2018Zvezda\u2019 published a video on YouTube regarding the clinical trials in Russia. In the video, the same woman can be found talking to the channel. The channel has referred to her as \u2018Natalya\u2019, \u2018a cadet of the Military Medical Academy named after S.M. Kirov\u2019 (translated by Google). The related article can be read here. So, she is not Putin\u2019s daughter because, as reported by news agencies, the names of Putin daughters are Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova.\n\nIn another article published by \u2018Zvezda\u2019, the face of the girl without any mask can be seen. So, it can be confirmed that the woman in the video is not Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s daughter.\n\nTo sum it up, the woman being vaccinated in the posted video is not Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s daughter.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
