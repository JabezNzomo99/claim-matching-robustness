Individual donors have to be British citizens, or Irish, EU and Commonwealth citizens living in the UK.\n\nA donation in the UK is: \u201cmoney, goods or services given to a party without charge or on non-commercial terms, with a value of over \u00a3500.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Electoral Commission, UK political parties can only accept donations from \u201cpermissible donors\u201d. Individuals must be on the electoral register to donate, which broadly means they have to be a British citizen, or an Irish, EU or qualifying Commonwealth citizen living in the UK.\n\nYou can\u2019t register to vote if you\u2019re solely a Russian citizen, for example, and so you wouldn\u2019t be able to make a donation to a UK political party. Russians who have taken British citizenship can donate.\n\nThe rules also say that only UK businesses can donate to parties in Great Britain and only UK and Irish businesses can donate in Northern Ireland, and the Electoral Commission lists the details of who\u2019s included in that for Great Britain and Northern Ireland separately.\n\nThe laws were originally introduced in 2000, partly in response to concerns that foreign sources could donate to political parties in the UK.\n\nParties are able to get funding from other sources too, including loans (which follow the same rules as donations), membership fees and some public funds.", "lang": "en"}
