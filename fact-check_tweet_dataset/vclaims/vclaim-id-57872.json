(GPT-3 is a \u201cdeep learning\u201d model created by the US artificial intelligence research laboratory OpenAI, which generates human-like text based on a short prompt.)\n\nGPT-3\u2019s claim is inaccurate. While the word robot is indeed derived from a term for forced labour, it does not come from Greek. The word is actually Czech in origin.\n\nThe word \u201crobot\u201d for an artificial being was originated by the Czech playwright Karel \u010capek in his 1920 play \u201cR.U.R.\u201d (which is short for \u201cRossum\u2019s Universal Robots\u201d). It was based on the Czech word \u201crobota\u201d, which means the kind of forced labour carried out by serfs under the feudal system. The word was used to describe the human labourers created by synthetic biology in the play.\n\nIn the article, which argues that humanity has little to fear from artificial intelligences, the GPT-3 model says that it is \u201calways grateful for feedback\u201d\u2014although elsewhere in the same article it also claims that it does not have feelings. Either way, we hope that GPT-3 accepts this correction in that spirit.", "lang": "en"}
