Scotland is out.\n\nIf Brexit happens and Scotland meanwhile votes to leave the UK, things are more complicated. There\u2019s no direct precedent for this situation.\n\nThe stance of the European Union itself is that an independent Scotland doesn\u2019t automatically step into the UK\u2019s shoes as an EU member. This was expressed in the 2012 \u201cBarroso document\u201d mentioned by Mrs May, in which the then President of the European Commission Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso wrote:\n\n\u201cIf part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.\u201d\n\nSo Scotland would have to apply to join the EU. A European Commission spokesman confirmed this week that this is still the position in Brussels.\n\nThis interpretation of the law has been criticised, and it\u2019s at least possible that the EU court might agree that an independent Scotland remains in the EU if a case somehow reached it, although other legal experts regard it as a fairly speculative argument.\n\nMore likely, then, is that the consent of all the other 27 EU member countries would be needed for Scotland to remain in or rejoin the EU.\n\nAs the EU is based on international treaties, and treaties can always be changed, it is technically possible for Scotland to be written in as an EU member before leaving the UK. But that seems unlikely given the stance of the central EU bodies and some members.\n\nSo the most likely scenario would be a Scottish exit upon independence, followed by negotiations on joining as a new member. That would be done under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union\u2014the article preceding the now famous Article 50.\n\nWhile it\u2019s conceivable that Article 49 negotiations could take place before independence rather than after, to ensure that there\u2019s no gap in Scottish EU membership, that might be vetoed by a country like Spain in the same way as a treaty change fix.", "lang": "en"}
