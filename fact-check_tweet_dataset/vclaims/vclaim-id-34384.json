Kaya dapat lahat magingat, mapa bata man o matanda!\u201d (So this is what happens to those who are abducted by a white van! That is why everyone must be careful, whether you are young or old!)\n\nIn the video, a student is seen standing on the sidewalk when a white van suddenly stops in front of him. A man suddenly steps out of the van and forcibly snatches the student.\n\nSince its posting, the video has gone viral, with over 775,300 views and interactions of nearly 36,800 shares, 6,100 reactions, and 2,500 comments. Rappler found the claim via Facebook Claim Check, a tool that spots potential false posts spreading on social media.\n\nThe facts: The video was staged. The Manila Police District (MPD) said their investigation showed that a group of teenagers made the prank video for fun, according to an ABS-CBN news report published in April 2019.

The MPD compared the two videos and noticed that the supposed victim was the same person.\n\nOne of those who was responsible for the prank video admitted that they only staged it. He confessed that they imitated what they saw on social media and made a prank video on their own.\n\nAs of writing, rumors have been spreading on Facebook about a white van roaming around different parts of Metro Manila and abducting teenagers. In Pasay City, 9 people aged 18 to 23 allegedly went missing on November 20 and November 22.\n\nAccording to a Philippine News Agency (PNA) report, Philippine National Police (PNP) spokesperson Brigade General Bernard Banac said only one report has been validated as an abduction, as shown through CCTV footage. The other cases have no solid evidence to be tagged as a kidnapping case.\n\nSenator Sherwin Gatchalian also urged the police to confirm and update the public to tell whether the rumors are true. He also looked at the possibility that the alleged abduction was only an \"urban legend\" since rumors of kidnapping and stealing of organs also caused panic in the past. - Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
