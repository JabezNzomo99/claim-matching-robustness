The flags in the photo are not Pakistan\u2019s flag but a similar looking Islamic flag, which was put up to mark a Muslim religious holiday in late November.\n\nThe photos, which have been shared hundreds of times since they were posted to Facebook December 2, 2018, claim to show Pakistan\u2019s national flag being put up on the streets of Kolkata to celebrate the city\u2019s newly elected mayor, Firhad Hakim.\n\nThe photos have a caption in Hindi that says: \u201cPakistan flags being put up in celebration of Kolkata\u2019s newly elected mayor Firhad Hakim. This is alarming for Hindus.\u201d\n\nThe misleading claim was first shared on Facebook on November 21, 2018 with caption in Bengali which says: \u201cThe flag of Pakistan is hanging across all of Domjur. The Trinamool will make state turn into mini Pakistan.\u201d\n\nDomjur is a town near Kolkata and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) is the political party to which mayor Hakim belongs. TMC councillors selected Hakim as mayor designate on November 22, 2018.\n\nThe flags in the photos in the misleading Facebook post are not Pakistan\u2019s national flag.\n\nThe flags in the photos are green with a star and crescent. Pakistan's flag is also green but it has a white stripe along the left side and a white crescent and star on it.\n\nA green flag with a star and crescent is an Islamic flag commonly used during religious festivals. Eid Milad-un-Nabi fell on November 21, 2018.\n\n\n\nThe Kolkata Traffic Police tweeted about the Eid Milad-un-Nabi festivities in the city on November 21, with the islamic flag clearly seen in their photo.", "lang": "en"}
