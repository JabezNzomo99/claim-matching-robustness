Vishvas News investigated and found the viral claim to be fake.\n\nIn a viral note widely shared on Facebook, it has been claimed that Alcohol, particularly vodka, reduces the risk of coronavirus. The viral post can be checked here.\n\nDuring our investigation, we found that in some social media posts the same text was shared purporting a press note from Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital, Kansas City.\n\nWhen we searched the name of the company we found a post on the Facebook page of \u2018Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital of Kansas City\u2019 in which it was clearly stated that the press note bearing their logo is false.\n\nWe also found an article on a local media website quoting Emily Hohenberg, the director of media relations with Saint Luke\u2019s Health, stating that, \u201cWe have received a request from all over the globe \u2013 Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, Finland, India, to name a few, as well as people here domestically about if we sent out this information. We know this can be confusing since whoever created this is using our logo and making it seem like it is a recommendation.\u201d\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Sajeev Kumar who is a General Physician and is treating patients infected with coronavirus. He refuted the claim that alcohol or Vodka can kill the novel coronavirus. \u201cThis is a bogus claim. Alcohol-based santisers can be used in cleaning hands, but consuming alcohol to prevent coronavirus is a fake claim.\u201d\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer for washing hands as a preventive action to help prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nWorld Health Organization also suggests that one should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water to protect yourself from novel coronavirus.\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a page named Beaver Saloon. We scanned the page and found that the page has 1481 followers.\n\nConsuming alcohol beverages or vodka will not reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection. The viral post is fake.\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
