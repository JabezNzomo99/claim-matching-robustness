He then turned his attention to British politics and society, specifically the issue of gender diversity in the West and liberalism.\n\nNekrassov cited Britain\u2019s ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u2019s response to an interview Vladimir Putin gave the U.K.\u2019s Financial Times newspaper on the eve of the G20 summit, in which the Russian president said the liberal idea \u201chad outlived its purpose.\u201d Johnson, who wrote that liberalism is delivering prosperity on a scale unimaginable to previous generations, argued the UK will prove liberalism is not obsolete by leaving the European Union.\n\nNekrassov said the claim liberalism has made Britain thrive is \u201cerroneous,\u201d arguing it celebrates \u201cmediocrity\u201d and drives countries to war.\n\nArguing that liberalism is behind \u201cthe brutal Russophobia\u201d in the West, Nekrassov claimed that by worshipping \u201cmoney and debauchery,\u201d liberal democracies morph into atheistic regimes that conduct witch hunts against \u201call of the major religions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBritain and all Western Europe, although it isn\u2019t acknowledged publically, are waging a war against the three major religions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war is extremely ingenious, skillfully inciting Christians, Jews and Muslims against each other. This war is endless.\u201d\n\nEvidence shows that illiberal governments have posed a much greater threat to religious communities than liberal ones.\n\nFor example, in its latest annual report, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), a bipartisan U.S. federal government commission, found the following countries to be the worst violators of religious freedom: Myanmar, Central African Republic, China, Eritrea, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.\n\nThe USCIRF report noted that in Russia, \u201cthe government continued to target \u2018nontraditional\u2019 religious minorities with fines, detentions, and criminal charges under the pretext of combating extremism.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cThe Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, whom the government banned outright in 2017, faced severe persecution by the state. By the end of the reporting period, hundreds of members remained in detention, had travel restrictions imposed, or were under investigation, and church property estimated at $90 million had been confiscated.\u201d\n\nAdherents of the Islamic missionary movement Tablighi Jamaat and readers of the works of Turkish theologian Said Nursi were also reportedly imprisoned for what the report described as \u201cpeaceful religious expression.\u201d\n\nThe Pew Research Center\u2019s ninth annual study of global restrictions on religion listed the following countries as having particularly high levels of government restrictions on religion -- Algeria, Azerbaijan, Brunei, China, Egypt, Eritrea, Indonesia Iran, Iraq Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia, the Maldives, Mauritania, Morocco, Myanmar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Western Sahara.\n\nThese are almost exclusively non-Western, non-liberal countries.\n\nPew also found the Middle East-North Africa region continued to have the highest median level of government restrictions on religion in 2016.\n\nThat year, Freedom House found that only two countries in that region, Israel and Tunisia, qualified as democracies.\n\nA report ordered by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt found that \u201cChristianity now faces the possibility of being wiped-out in parts of the Middle East where its roots go back furthest.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International also documented state-backed repression of religion throughout the region.\n\nThe next most repressive region (according to Pew) was Asia-Pacific, and the country that scored highest on the Government Restrictions Index was China, where up to one million Uighur Muslims have been subjected to mass internment, surveillance, and forced cultural assimilation.\n\nUSCIRF said that the Chinese government \u201ccontinued to persecute all faiths \u2026 not only to diminish and erase the independent practice of religion, but also the cultural and linguistic heritage of religious and ethnic communities, particularly Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims.\u201d\n\nIn North Korea, a UN report concluded there is \u201can almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.\u201d\n\nThe independent human rights organization Christian Solidarity Worldwide said Christians in North Korea are subject to detention for practicing their faith, where they face \u201cextra-judicial killing, extermination, enslavement/forced labor, forcible transfer of population, arbitrary imprisonment, torture, persecution, enforced disappearance, rape and sexual violence, and other inhumane acts.\u201d\n\nState-sponsored acts of genocide against Rohingya Muslims have been documented in Myanmar. The report for the British foreign secretary found that in the Central Asian states of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, \u201cthe freedom of religion and belief [are] severely inhibited as churches are regularly raided,\u201d while in Saudi Arabia and the Maldives, Christians cannot hold meetings in the privacy of their own homes.\n\nBy contrast, the magazine U.S. News and World Report, which surveyed 20,000 people worldwide to evaluate 80 countries, found the following 10 countries (all Western, liberal democracies) are perceived as offering the greatest religious freedom:\n\nAs noted by Pew and others, Muslims have been targeted by nationalist political parties or officials in the West. A few Western governments have faced criticism for being Islamaphobic on account of banning the face veil, including Austria and Belgium while France\u2019s ban of the Burkini passed by the country\u2019s parliament in 2010 has also incited controversy. Notably, Belgium\u2019s ban on face veils was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights in 2017.\n\nBut based on all of the available evidence, the claims that it is liberal, democratic societies conducting a witch hunt against \u201call of the major religions\u201d is false.\u200b", "lang": "en"}
