There is no evidence of any cut, nor any proposed cut. Yet there is uncertainty about continued funding, for this and other programmes, in light of the composition of a new Northern Ireland Executive (or direct rule governance) after elections in March 2017.\n\nConfusion continues to reign over the status of funding for youth worker posts \u2014 with budget deadlines looming and an Assembly election coming up.\n\nIn an article published on 24 January, the Irish News wrote: \u201cHundreds of youth work posts are under threat after funding cut.\u201d It further stated that \u201cthe Education Authority has advised that money for \u2018extended provision\u2019 positions across the north will end in March.\u201d\n\nEducation Minister Peter Weir made repeated assurances that the budget for youth worker posts \u2014 said to number 130 in West Belfast alone \u2014 will roll over after 1 April 2017.\n\nDuring an appearance on Nolan Live on 15 February (time marker 27:00), the minister was asked by Gerry Carroll of People Before Profit about the jobs, claiming they were at risk. The minister replied: \u201cThe budget will continue on for those posts, those people\u2019s jobs are safe.\u201d\n\nHowever, because budgets across all departments are on hold until after the election, exact numbers are impossible to come by.\n\nThe same day as the article appeared in the Irish News, the Department of Education issued a press release with the headline: \u201cYouth sector funding has not been removed\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cEducation Minister Peter Weir has expressed his concern that the issue of funding for the youth sector is being used to cause unnecessary anxiety for those working in the area.\u201d\n\nAt issue are so-called \u201cprotective notices\u201d \u2014 letters that are sent out by the Education Authority (EA) to certain employees who are not on permanent contracts.\n\nAccording to statutory procedures, all public employees whose wages are paid from outside the mainstream budget receive this notification when their funding stream is coming up for review. These are positions (including advisors, Early Stage workers and youth workers) that are funded as part of a specific project or \u201cidentified need\u201d for a period of time \u2014 some as part of a multi-year cycle, some as part of a yearly cycle.\n\n\u201cIt just so happens that the youth workers are on a yearly contract, so they get a letter every year,\u201d said John Martin, communications officer for the Education Authority, the body that administers the youth workers\u2019 budgets.\n\nThere is a wider climate of budget uncertainty, because of the timing of the March election to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the need for an approved operating budget for the next financial period\n\nYet there has been no statement or evidence demonstrating that funding provision for these posts has been removed. Thus the original headline by the Irish News \u2014 citing a funding cut \u2014 is false, or at least unproven.\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
