The doctor asked Johnson to hold an ultrasound transducer to the woman\u2019s stomach as he performed the operation. Johnson told Carney she had never seen this done before, since ultrasound machines are not commonly used for first-trimester abortions, which make up the vast majority of abortions done at most clinics. What she witnessed on the ultrasound monitor, she said, horrified her. The fetus seemed to be moving away from the doctor\u2019s probe, which was clearly visible on the screen as it entered the patient\u2019s uterus. Johnson thought of all the patients whom she had told that their fetuses wouldn\u2019t feel anything during the procedure. Then, as Johnson watched, the doctor turned on the suction.\n\nShortly afterwards, social media users began circulating an image purporting to reproduce tweets issued by Johnson some three months earlier, in which she advocated for a return to \u201chousehold voting\u201d (i.e., a system under which a single vote is cast for an entire household, rather than each adult in the household voting individually), and declared that if a husband and wife differed politically, the husband\u2019s decision should hold sway (in \u201cGodly households,\u201d at least):\n\nMany Snopes readers inquired of us whether this image reproduced genuine tweets posted by Johnson. In fact it did, as is easily verified since the tweets are still visible in the timeline of Johnson\u2019s Twitter account:", "lang": "en"}
