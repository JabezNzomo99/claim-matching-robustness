Welcome in. Come in, please.\"\n\nThe reality is Obama carried out more than 5.2 million deportations over two terms. That figure combines both \"removals,\" which involve a formal court order, and \"returns,\" which don\u2019t.\n\nObama returned more than 2 million Central Americans in his first seven years in office, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Immigration Statistics (that does not include formal removals or 2016 data).\n\nRoughly 150,000 of those deported under Obama were returned to El Salvador, from which MS-13 hails, according to data from the Los Angeles Times.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2013, one in five deportations over this time were to Central America\u2019s \"Northern Triangle\" countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, some of the world\u2019s most dangerous countries, according to data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nMichelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute said Obama confronted a surge in migration from Central America, particularly from the Northern Triangle, fueled by instability, gang violence and worsening economic conditions. She noted the Obama administration faced legal constraints -- both from a congressional statutes and court rulings -- that impeded its ability to remove an influx of illegal entrants with children, or unaccompanied minors, many of whom were fleeing Central America.\n\n\"We have trade deficits with almost every country.\"\n\nTrump said he couldn\u2019t find countries where the United States currently has a trade surplus. He might not have looked that hard.\n\n\"We have trade deficits with almost every country, because we had a lot of really bad negotiators making deals with other countries,\" Trump said.\n\nYes, the United States has a significant trade deficit with China, smaller trade deficits with Germany, Japan and Mexico.\n\nBut the United States actually has a trade surplus with more than half of the countries or governments it does business with, according to data kept by the United States International Trade Commission.\n\nIn 2016, the United States recorded a trade surplus with 134 different nations or governments. It ran a deficit with 99 nations or governments.\n\nA surplus occurs when the United States exports more goods to a country than it imports from it.\n\n\"I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode, and then do it. I turned out to be right. Let Obamacare implode.\"\n\nTrump actually argued that Republicans should not let Obamacare collapse because \"it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the people.\"\n\n\"Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the people,\" Trump said at a Jan. 11, 2017, press conference in New York.\n\n\"We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare. We don\u2019t want to own it, we don\u2019t want to own it politically. They own it right now.\n\n\"So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in \u201917 and believe me, we\u2019d get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. We\u2019re going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary\u2019s approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan.\"\n\nAt the same press conference, Trump said he would repeal and replace Obamacare at the same time. It was also a core campaign promise.\n\n\"It\u2019ll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour,\" Trump said.\n\n\"So we\u2019re gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. And we\u2019re gonna get a health bill passed, we\u2019re gonna get health care taken care of in this country.\"\n\n\"GDP is up double from what it was in the first quarter. 2.6 percent.\"\n\nThe GDP indeed grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent between April and June, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, more than double the rate at which it grew in the first quarter (1.2 percent). This is the first full quarter of GDP growth since Trump took office.\n\nIt\u2019s much closer to the 3 percent growth rate promised by Trump in May, although many economists we\u2019ve interviewed said sustaining that level of growth without substantial policy changes would prove difficult.\n\nEconomists would also refrain from attributing the growth to Trump, as many of his policies have yet to be implemented. Consumer spending, which typically makes up about 70 percent of the economy, partially drove the increase.\n\n\"Trump doesn't win, your Second Amendment is gone.\"\n\nTrump dialed up a popular but False attack on his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"By the way, your Second Amendment is safe. Your Second Amendment is safe,\" Trump said. \"I feel very good about that. Wasn't looking so good for the Second Amendment, was it, huh? If Trump doesn't win, your Second Amendment is gone. Your Second Amendment would be gone.\n\nThere was no no evidence of Democrat Hillary Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment \u2014 and the bulk of Clinton\u2019s comments suggest she wanted to protect the right to bear arms while enacting measures to prevent gun violence.", "lang": "en"}
