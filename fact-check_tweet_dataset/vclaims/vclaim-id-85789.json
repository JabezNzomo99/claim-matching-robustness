But the claim fell apart completely when The Fact Checker dug into the budget numbers. President Obama\u2019s Republican predecessor oversaw big increases in public-health sector spending, and both Democrats and Republicans in recent years have broadly supported efforts to rein in federal spending. There\u2019s no doubt that spending has been cut, or at least failed to keep pace with inflation, but the fingerprints of both parties are on the knives. We gave the blame game Four Pinocchios.\n\nThe Democratic candidate challenging Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stood in front of the camera and, putting her credibility on the line, uttered statements that she must have known are false. Her central claim \u2014 that McConnell had pocketed $600,000 from anti-coal groups \u2014 had already earned Four Pinocchios. The claim was based on money earned by McConnell\u2019s wife, much of which came from being on a board of a bank that finances coal companies. But Grimes also accused McConnell of failing to get the right environmental equipment for a privately-held power plant \u2014 which is not a senator\u2019s job. We labeled this as possibly the worst ad of the campaign year \u2014 and then the McConnell campaign use the fact check in a particularly dismaying way.\n\n3: Rand Paul\u2019s claim that the White House suggested Ebola transmission is like AIDS\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) accused the White House of suggesting that the Ebola virus was transmitted like HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. But that was not the case; the administration only suggested that Ebola was a public-health emergency of the same potential scale as AIDS. Both AIDS and Ebola are not airborne viruses, but it should be clear to anyone watching the news that Ebola is spread differently from AIDS, given the required attire of hospital staff treating Ebola patients. Indeed, administration officials, from the president on down, have emphasized that people should not touch Ebola patients. Paul earned Three Pinocchios.\n\n4: Iraq WMD: Does the New York Times probe reflect what administration officials claimed?\n\nA New York Times investigation into military casualties of Iraq\u2019s abandoned chemical weapons inspired some commentary that this proves that the George W. Bush administration\u2019s assertions about Iraq\u2019s WMD programs turned out to be correct. But in reality, the Bush administration staked its WMD claims on an active, ongoing program that was restarted after the 1991 invasion of Kuwait \u2014 and the weapons that were found were manufactured before the Kuwait conflict. As a reader service, The Fact Checker provided examples of Bush administration claims made before the 2003 war started. We preemptively declared that anyone who claims that the New York Times story vindicates George W. Bush-era claims of Iraq WMD automatically earns Four Pinocchios.\n\nIn his campaign to win a sixth term to the Senate, McConnell had some difficulty with the Obamacare issue because the Kentucky version, known as Kynect, has been a huge success. About half a million Kentuckians signed up for health insurance, many receiving it for the first time. So McConnell threaded a very difficult needle, suggesting that the Web site can continue while the law that created it must be scrapped. Ultimately, we concluded that his statements on Obamacare are a bit slick and misleading. If he wants to rip out Obamacare \u201croot and branch,\u201d then he has to explain what he would plant in the health-insurance garden instead. He earned Three Pinocchios.\n\n5: Obama\u2019s claim that Obamacare has helped produce an \u2018$1,800 tax cut\u2019\n\nThe president trotted it out a new talking point \u2014 that the slowdown in rising health-care premiums meant that the average family was getting an \u201c$1,800 tax cut\u201d because of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. We examined the math behind this statement, but it was a difficult claim to judge. The math adds up, but the results depend a lot on what window of time you use for comparison \u2014 and also how much you attribute the difference to the Affordable Care Act. We ended up giving Two Pinocchios to Obama, but in retrospect we might have been a bit generous.", "lang": "en"}
