The editorial cited research on median household incomes by the nonpartisan economic consulting firm Sentier Research. The firm had produced a report, such as this one, which had documented the serious decline in inflation-adjusted median income in the aftermath of the Great Recession \u2014 which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, six months after Obama took office.\n\nThe advantage of Sentier\u2019s research is that the firm produces a monthly snapshot, using data from the Census Bureau\u2019s monthly household survey, which is used to also calculate the national unemployment rate. The Census Bureau uses the same data to come up with an annual figure \u2014 but the most recent number is for 2014. By contrast, Sentier has an income figure for April 2016, meaning it is more up-to-date. Each month, Sentier recalculates the numbers dating to 2000 to adjust for inflation, meaning the latest report has all of the data in April 2016 dollars.\n\nGordon Green, one of the principals at the firm, provided The Fact Checker with a spreadsheet of the monthly data, with the request that not all of the numbers be posted on the Internet because of proprietary issues. Here is the median household income for key months during the recession and afterward:\n\nAs you can see, even after taking into account the impact of inflation, median household income is now slightly higher than when Obama took office, not \u201c$3,000 to $4,000\u201d lower. It slipped slightly from March to April, but Green says it is not unusual for the number to bounce around on a monthly basis. What\u2019s more important, he said, is that \u201cit\u2019s been on a steady increase since August, 2011. You can see that we have come back quite a bit.\u201d\n\nGreen noted that the United States suffered through a very serious financial recession, \u201cwhich takes a while to turn around.\u201d In fact, median household income was already on an upward swing when the Wall Street Journal editorial appeared. Now, median household income is more than $5,000 higher than at its lowest point in Obama\u2019s presidency, an increase of almost 10 percent.\n\nTo be sure, the Sentier data (and Census Bureau annual data) does show that since 2000, the last year of the Bill Clinton administration, median household income has been largely flat. (It was $57,576 in January 2000.) In other words, flat growth in income has extended over two full presidential terms.\n\nThat\u2019s the other problem with McConnell\u2019s statement, besides being woefully out of date. The recession, which caused the drop in household income, began well before Obama became president. Obama did take steps to mitigate the crisis, so perhaps he can share in the blame (or the credit) for how the economy has performed since then. But a president has only limited control over the overall direction of the economy.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office had no real response, except to forward a recent Pew Research report regarding a decline in median household income from 1999 to 2014. However, the data in that report is not as recent as the Sentier data \u2014 which, after all, was the basis of the original GOP talking point. The office also sent a New York Times article that mentioned a decline in household income since Clinton left office (apparently based on old data) \u2014 but McConnell\u2019s quote was about Obama. So we were not sure what the point was.\n\nFinally, McConnell\u2019s office pointed to annual Census data that showed median household income of $54,925 in 2009 and $53,657 in 2014 (the most recent year available). That\u2019s a negative $1,300 in 2014 dollars. That\u2019s certainly much less than \u201c$3,000 or $4,000.\u201d Moreover, as we have shown, it is out of date, according to the source cited by Republicans in the past.\n\nWith the unemployment rate at about 5 percent \u2014 half the level in Obama\u2019s first year \u2014 McConnell should have checked before uttering such a stale talking point. Instead, he reached back to a statistic that is four years out of date \u2014 and assigns far too much credit to a president for the state of the economy.\n\nVirtually no growth in inflation-adjusted income since 2000 is a legitimate issue. But it is not an Obama-specific issue. McConnell needs to come up with a different explanation for Donald Trump\u2019s rise \u2014 and why people are \u201clegitimately angry.\u201d In the meantime, he earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
