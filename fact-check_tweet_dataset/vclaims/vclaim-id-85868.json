The Enliven Project is described as \u201ca campaign to bring sexual violence out of the closet and lift survivors to their full potential,\u201d according to its Web site. Here\u2019s an example of how it shows up on Twitter:\n\nIt uses illustrations of a male figure to quantify \u201crapists,\u201d but the information it cites refers to cases of rape or sexual assault. As Slate pointed out, this is an incorrect assumption that there is one rape per perpetrator. There are various studies that show the frequency of rapes being perpetrated multiple times by the same person. Sarah Beaulieu, founder of The Enliven Project, agreed to this point in a follow-up post on the Web site.\n\nExperts have pointed out limitations of the National Crime Victimization Survey in quantifying reports of rape. For example, the survey\u2019s definitions of rape or \u201csexual attack\u201d is inconsistent with states\u2019 legal definitions or with standard methodology for sexual assault research, according to research by End Violence Against Women International\u2019s Kimberly Lonsway, who is one of the most-cited experts on the topic. The limitations in this data collection method reduce estimates for prevalence and incidence, according to Lonsway\u2019s research, because victims of sexual assault may not identify with the particular wording presented in the survey.\n\nThe graphic shows one-third of the \u201crapists\u201d who \u201cfaced trial\u201d (which are not really rapists, but are cases of rape) were jailed. She provides three sources of information \u2014 a 1999 study on the probability of prison for rape, BJS data that show the percentage of convicted rapists and the percentage that were incarcerated, and a report by RAINN that in 3 out of 100 rapes, the perpetrator \u201cwill spend even a single day in prison.\u201d\n\nOne of the sources she used was BJS report on felony defendants from 2006. Even based on that data, the rate of incarceration among people convicted of rate is much higher than one-third. That report also shows that 46 percent of felony rape convictions resulted in guilty pleas \u2014 a much higher rate than ones that went to trial, an observation not noted in this graphic.\n\nFalse reporting is a difficult number to measure. The Enliven Project uses 2 percent of \u201cfalsely accused\u201d cases, out of the 100 reported cases of rape. There is an important distinction that must be made here, between accusations and reports. \u201cAccusations\u201d may refer to claims that were not made in official police reports, whereas \u201creports\u201d generally refer to cases that were filed with law enforcement.\n\nThat, again, seems to be the lower end of the estimate range. The \u201cMaking a Difference\u201d Project, which used data collected by law enforcement agencies over 18 to 24 months, found 7 percent of cases that were classified as false. That study is the \u201conly research conducted in the U.S. to evaluate the percentage of false reports made to law enforcement,\u201d according to the National Center for the Prosecution of Violence Against Women. Other studies also estimate somewhere between 2 and 10 percent.\n\nWhen The Fact Checker asked Beaulieu why she did not change the graphic to fix errors she admitted, she said: \u201cThe original one is already the one that has gone viral and is the one that\u2019s continuing to be circulated. I think what I did do was make sure that the link back to the site that\u2019s on the graphic links to the full explanation that acknowledges the distinction.\u201d Yet the link isn\u2019t even a hyperlink, so the explanation is not readily accessible to those who may be scrolling through their news feeds. You literally have to type out a complex URL to find her explanations.\n\nBut for a graphic titled \u201cthe truth about false accusation,\u201d it is quite misleading, and incorrect in many aspects. It\u2019s a pretty graphic, but pretty does not mean accurate; it should serve as a cautionary tale to those in the public prone to retweets or reposts of attractive graphics. In many cases, when faced with a range of figures, Beaulieu put her finger on the scale by choosing the number that grabbed as much attention as possible, such as choosing two for false reports rather than 10.", "lang": "en"}
