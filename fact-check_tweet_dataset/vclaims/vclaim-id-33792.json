{"title": "General Election 2019: Tory \u00a31.2 trillion Labour spending claim fact-checked", "subtitle": "The Conservative Party claims Labour's spending plans would cost an extra \u00a31.2tn over the next five years.", "author": "www.bbc.co.uk", "date": "2019-11-19T17:05:29.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-33792", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/50459811", "vclaim": "The Conservative Party released a dossier, which claimed that a Labour government would mean extra spending of \u00a31.2tn. The Conservatives arrived at this figure by adding up spending pledges from Labour's manifesto in 2017, commitments made by the shadow cabinet since then and policies passed by the Labour Party conference.\n\nIt would be the same as assuming that the Conservative Party manifesto will include all of the pledges Boris Johnson made in the Conservative Party leadership election, such as raising the threshold at which the higher rate of income tax is due from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, which he costed at \u00a310bn a year.\n\nThere is also an issue with some of the costings in the dossier. For example, the Conservatives cost Labour's nationalisation plans at \u00a3196bn. This is based on an estimate - by the Confederation of British Industry - which was itself the subject of criticism.\n\nYou can read more about that figure in this Reality Check piece, but there are clear problems with it, such as the assumption that a Labour government would pay 30% more than assets were worth when buying them.\n\nThere would, for example, be a \u00a3150bn social transformation fund to pay for upgrades to schools, hospitals, social care facilities and council homes over five years, as well as a \u00a3250bn green transformation fund to spend on things like sustainable energy and transport over 10 years.", "lang": "en"}
