The people who are protesting against it, do they want that we should give citizenship to all the terrorists coming in from Pakistan?\u201d he asks.\n\nTimes Now had invited Rizwan Ahmed for a panel discussion that was broadcast on December 20, 2018. The channel identified him as Naseeruddin Shah\u2019s first cousin. Ahmed looks nothing like the man in the viral video. A collage of their photographs juxtaposed together makes it evident that they are different people.\n\nWHO IS THE MAN IN THE VIDEO?\n\nThe video carries a logo of \u2018Youth Media TV\u2019. Alt News searched the corresponding YouTube channel and found that the video was posted on January 2, 2020, with the caption \u201c\u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0915\u093e\u0928\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u091c \u0932\u0917\u0947 \u0928\u093e\u0930\u0947,\u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0939\u094c\u0932 \u0916\u093c\u0930\u093e\u092c \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091c\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948? IIT-Kanpur Faiz poem News today\u201d (Translation: Slogans were raised in IIT Kanpur today, is the situation in the country being disturbed? IIT-Kanpur Faiz poem News today).\n\nA reverse image search of one of the keyframes of the video revealed that the man is Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Acharya Dharmendra.\n\nIn 2017, he was sentenced to one-year imprisonment by a Rajasthan court for making a hate speech in November 2008. That same year, Dharmendra again made it to headlines for commenting that a nuclear bomb should be dropped on Pakistan.\n\nA video of VHP leader Acharya Dharmendra extending support for the CAA is being shared in the name of Naseeruddin Shah\u2019s brother, Rizan Ahmed.", "lang": "en"}
