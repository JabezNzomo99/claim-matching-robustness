Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: The incident in the image took place in Deoria (Uttar Pradesh) in 2018. But, there is no BJP MLA with the name Karni Singh. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image is subjected to reverse image search technique, an article of \u2018Jagran\u2019 was obtained in the search results. The article published on 4th March 2018 had the same image and from the article, it was found that the incident took place in Deoria of Uttar Pradesh. In the article, details of the persons involved in this incident were not given. In the post, BJP MLA Karni Singh was claimed to have been involved in that incident. So, when searched on \u2018Myneta\u2019 database for MLA Karni Singh, no BJP MLA or any other party MLA with that name was found to exist.\n\nTo conclude, a 2018 image is being falsely shared as \u2018BJP MLA Karni Singh destroyed Ambedkar statue\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
