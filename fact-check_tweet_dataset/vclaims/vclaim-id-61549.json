Michele Bachmann says President Barack Obama's approval ratings are historically low -- and sinking even lower.\n\n \n\n During the Sept. 22, 2011, Fox News/Google debate in Orlando, Bachmann said, \"President Obama has the lowest public approval ratings of any president in modern times. He hasn't gone to the basement yet. It'll be a lot lower than what it is now.\"\n\n \n\n We can't explore her prediction, but we can examine if Obama has the lowest ratings of any modern president. Are they really worse than those of Richard \"Tricky Dick\" Nixon, Jimmy \"Malaise\" Carter and Lyndon \"Hey, Hey, LBJ, How Many Kids Did You Kill Today\" Johnson?\n\n \n\n Not by a long shot.\n\n \n\n We looked at presidential approval data from Gallup, which goes back to Harry Truman. It\u2019s the longest continuous data set for presidential approval ratings. We looked at two different measurements: Each president\u2019s lowest approval rating for their entire term, and each president\u2019s lowest point for their first 968 days, which is how long Obama has served in office.\n\n \n\n First, the lows for the presidents' entire terms, listed in descending order from the \"highest\" low to the \"lowest\" low:\n\n \n\n John F. Kennedy: 56 percent\n\n Dwight Eisenhower: 48 percent\n\n Barack Obama: 40 percent\n\n Bill Clinton: 37 percent\n\n Gerald Ford: 37 percent\n\n Ronald Reagan: 35 percent\n\n Lyndon B. Johnson: 35 percent\n\n George H.W. Bush: 29 percent\n\n Jimmy Carter: 28 percent\n\n George W. Bush: 25 percent\n\n Richard Nixon: 24 percent\n\n Harry Truman: 22 percent\n\n \n\n By this measure, nine presidents hit lower lows than Obama has.\n\n \n\n What about comparing only the first 968 days for each president? Bachmann\u2019s closer with this one, but still wrong. Here is a list of each president\u2019s low point during that time frame:\n\n \n\n John F. Kennedy: 61 percent\n\n Dwight Eisenhower: 57 percent\n\n George H.W. Bush: 53 percent\n\n George W. Bush: 50 percent\n\n Richard Nixon: 48 percent\n\n Lyndon B. Johnson: 46 percent\n\n Barack Obama: 40 percent\n\n Bill Clinton: 37 percent\n\n Gerald Ford: 37 percent\n\n Ronald Reagan: 35 percent\n\n Harry Truman: 33 percent\n\n Jimmy Carter: 28 percent\n\n \n\n By this measure, five presidents had lows that were worse than Obama at this point in their presidencies.\n\n \n\n So Bachmann is far off either way. We're reaching for the matches: Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
