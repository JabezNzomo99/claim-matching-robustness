Bowing down to the wisdom of the heir to the largest party in the country),\u201c reads a message viral on social media.\n\nThe claim that Congress MP Rahul Gandhi paid last respects to not only Sushma Swaraj but her entire family after her demise was furthered using a screenshot of an alleged tweet by Gandhi which said \u2013 \u201c\u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u094b \u0915\u093e\u092b\u0940 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0925\u0947\u0964 \u0909\u0938\u0915\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930 \u0914\u0930 \u091a\u093e\u0939\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0902\u091c\u0932\u093f\u0964 (She was immensely revered by people. A tribute to her and her family.)\u201d\n\nAlt News has also received fact-check requests on its app.\n\nThe first clue which suggested that the screenshot is ingenuine is that the alleged tweet\u2019s Hindi text did not match the contents of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s original tweet, which clearly stated \u2013 \u201cMy condolences to her family in this hour of grief. May her soul rest in peace.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the top right corner of the viral screenshot carried a blurred logo of Delhi Aaj Tak. Though unclear, the logo can be made out upon close analysis.\n\nWe found that Delhi Aaj Tak\u2019s August 7 broadcast flashed Rahul Gandhi\u2019s tweet multiple times during the program. However, the channel ran his tweet as it is, without a Hindi translation.\n\nThe screenshot below shows one of the portions of the broadcast where Rahul Gandhi\u2019s tweet was flashed by Delhi Aaj Tak. As evident, the media outlet broadcast his English tweet.\n\nFor further corroboration, Alt News contacted Delhi Aaj Tak executive editor Shams Tahir Khan who informed that the channel did not broadcast the tweet viral on social media. He told us, \u201cThis has been morphed by someone. This is apparent just at first glance because we use a different font. We cross-checked the time in the screenshot when the tweet appears with our broadcast and found that we did not flash anything of the sort at that time.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, the Delhi Aaj Tak screenshot flashing an alleged tweet by Rahul Gandhi is a work of photoshop.", "lang": "en"}
