Over footage of a group of masked protestors burning an American flag, the post has the bold news headline \"\u2018MAGA bomber\u2019 identified as former CNN employee who donated to heavily to Hillary Clinton.\" (The video matches an antifa flag burning in Portland, Ore.)\n\nThe video had over 30,000 views, and if the comments are any guide, it reached a receptive audience. Comments included \"The Democratic Party is a terrorist organization,\" and \"The fake pipe bomb fiasco that has gripped America for the last two days is rapidly unraveling as a political hoax.\"\n\nA couple of people asked \"Is this for real?\"\n\nTo which we say, no. This is pure, 100 percent certified fake news.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s latest statement (as of the time we published) says only that an 11th package was recovered in Florida, addressed to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.\n\nThere\u2019s been no announcement of any suspects, much less a person with ties to CNN or the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\n\nStranger Than Fiction News also promotes the false story of crisis actors who pretend to be grieving survivors after gun massacres .\n\nTake this as your daily dose of Pants on Fire fake news.", "lang": "en"}
