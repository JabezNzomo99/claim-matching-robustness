And was she actually an unhappy customer of the drug dealer? No, all of that is not true, it was made up by a satirical website poking fun at recent cases of angry white women calling the cops on black people having a BBQ at a public park or selling bottled water.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on July 1, 2018 titled \"White Woman Calls Cops On Innocent Man Selling Crack Cocaine Outside Her Apartment\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nCHICAGO - A white woman who called police on a 28-year old black man for selling crack cocaine in Chicago said she has received an onslaught of gunfire and death threats since a video of the confrontation went viral, adding that her actions were never racially motivated but that she just wanted the drug dealer to move to another location. She also said the drug dealer was selling extremely cut crack cocaine and was not a satisfied customer.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nSome examples of the types of stories this article is lampooning include:\n\nA white woman has been caught on video calling the police on a black family enjoying a barbecue at a park in Oakland, California. The woman in the video justified the call by saying the family weren't allowed to have the barbecue because they were using charcoal, which she claimed was prohibited by law.\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Alabama Man In Custody After Promising Kids V-Bucks, Did NOT Sexually Abuse Them\n\u2022 Fake News: Germany NOT Discussing Nuking South Korea After Being Eliminated From FIFA World Cup\n\u2022 NOT Fake News: Shooting Suspect Actualy Arrested In Death Of XXXTentacion\n\u2022 Fake News: Jr Smith Did NOT Admit He Drank Hennessy During Halftime Of Game 1 Of The NBA Finals\n\u2022 Fake News: Roseanne Did NOT Adopt 3 Year Old African Kid To Prove She's Not Racist", "lang": "en"}
