This moratorium did not, however, completely halt coal production on public lands \u2014 Secretary\u2019s Order 3338 temporarily stopped new coal mining efforts from starting up on public lands but but allowed existing coal mining projects to continue in operation:\n\nThe Obama administration will halt new coal mining on public land for the next three years with immediate effect as it undertakes a review of the \u201cenvironmental and public health impacts\u201d of coal production. The wide-ranging review, applauded by climate and environmental groups, will assess how federal coal production fits in with the US\u2019s commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. It will also ensure \u201cAmerican taxpayers are earning a fair return for the use of their public resources\u201d \u2014 raising the possibility of a hike in royalties or a new levy on coal producers. About 40% of US coal is mined on public land. Barack Obama flagged new restrictions on coal exploitation in his State of the Union address, saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.\u201d The department of interior, which oversees leases on public land, stressed that coal would continue to be an important part of the US\u2019s energy mix and that current operations would not be affected by the freeze in new leases. It is estimated there is around 20 years-worth of coal production already under way, with 50 pending leases set to be affected by the decision. \u201cThe federal coal program is in needs of modernization, as we haven\u2019t down a top-down review for the past 30 years,\u201d said Sally Jewell, secretary of the department of interior. \u201cThe lease program was designed to get as much coal out of the ground as possible. It\u2019s time to take a careful look to see if it best serves the needs and priorities of today.\u201d\n\nAlthough President Trump\u2019s executive order lifted this moratorium a few years earlier then originally intended, it did not \u201copen\u201d public lands to coal mining, as such activity had already taken place and was still underway. The order did, however, allow for federal lands to be leased to coal companies for new mining operations that were precluded while the moratorium was in effect:\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke has ended the federal government\u2019s Obama-era moratorium on coal-mining leases on federal land. Zinke signed an order repealing the pause in leases in his Washington, D.C., office, surrounded by Republican lawmakers, lobbyists and staffers. The action implements parts of an executive order that President Trump signed \u2014 focused on repealing environmental policies and restrictions on energy production \u2014 under the goal of increasing energy independence. That means the Bureau of Land Management can now resume the process of allowing new coal-mining leases on its land.\n\nSo yes, President Trump signed an executive order that allowed for the issuance of new coal mining leases for federal lands. But existing coal mining operations on federal lands were still ongoing, and the moratorium that precluded the issuance of new coal mining leases was due to expire in 2019.", "lang": "en"}
