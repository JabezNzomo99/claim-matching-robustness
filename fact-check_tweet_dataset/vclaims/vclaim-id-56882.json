The post wasn\u2019t true then, it wasn\u2019t true when we checked it again earlier this year, and there\u2019s no reason to believe it\u2019s become true since.\n\nWe know for a fact that Ms Begum was in Syria in February 2020, as journalist James Longman interviewed her there on 14 February 2020.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen no evidence that would suggest she has returned. The UK government revoked her British citizenship in February 2019, and has refused to let her come back. She lost the first stage of her appeal on this decision in February 2020.", "lang": "en"}
