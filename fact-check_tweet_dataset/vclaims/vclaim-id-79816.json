This is false; Zimbabwe\u2019s government owns the building and therefore cannot be evicted. Officials confirmed that the embassy had thrown out office furniture as part of a general \u201ccleaning exercise\u201d.\n\n\u201cZimbabwe Embassy evicted from their rented building in London for not paying rent. Mnangagwa must go\u2026. What an embarrassment to our nation,\u201d reads the text accompanying the image in a September 26 Facebook post which we\u2019ve archived here.\n\nThe photo shows furniture all along the sidewalk in front of the entrance to Zimbabwe House, the country\u2019s embassy in London.\n\nSimilar social media posts can be seen shared hundreds of times here and here, further spreading the claim.\n\nThe building seen in the photo is indeed Zimbabwe\u2019s London embassy -- you can recognise it from images available on Google Maps.\n\nAFP on October 3 called the number listed for Zimbabwe House at 429 Strand in London, to confirm if the embassy had been closed or evicted from its location.\n\n\u201cNo,it is not [closed], you can just walk into our office -- if you want to see, you can visit us right now. We are right opposite Charing Cross Police Station, 429,\u201d said a male staff member in the House.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Embassy told AFP that the picture shows the last load of old furniture waiting to be collected after the building was cleaned.\n\n\u201cThe embassy undertook a general cleaning exercise and disposed of old furniture as well as obsolete equipment which had accumulated over the years,\u201d said T.J. Chimbandi of the embassy on behalf of the Zimbabwe ambassador.\n\n\u201cThe equipment and furniture was gathered outside the entrance of the Embassy for collection by a disposal company the embassy contracted.\u201d\n\nShortly after the post first appeared, social media users rejected the eviction claim, commenting that the embassy had been operating normally.\n\n\u201cWas business as usual all day,\u201d one user wrote in a September 25 comment on another Facebook post making the eviction claim. He posted a picture of what appeared to be a queue inside the embassy. The room matches the appearance of another image of the inside of the embassy taken in 2017 -- you can see the same distinctive crest hanging above the gold window frame.\n\nZimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chin\u2019ono also published a Facebook post refuting the eviction, saying the Zimbabwean government had inherited the building from Rhodesia.\n\nAnother comment on Chin\u2019ono\u2019s post also said the embassy was operating normally on September 26.\n\nThe London Diplomatic List, containing the addresses and contact details of all embassies and High Commissions, was updated on October 2, days after the claims about the eviction.\n\nZimbabwe House is still listed at 429 Strand.\n\nAFP in London also visited the building on October 11 and saw that the embassy was operating as normal.\n\nThe building was erected in 1908 to serve as headquarters for the British Medical Association. The government of Southern Rhodesia had acquired the British Medical Association Building in the Strand and remodelled it into offices for its London representatives.\n\nIt\u2019s been known as Zimbabwe House since the country\u2019s independence in 1980. Prior to that, it was known as Rhodesia House.\n\nZimbabwe House is also a Grade II* listed building on the National Heritage List for England - that grading means it\u2019s an important building of more than special interest.\n\nAccording to the UK Land Registry, Zimbabwe House belongs to the Zimbabwe government.\n\n\u201cThe registration took place in 1965, at which time the ownership was recorded according to the recognised head of state at the time; her Majesty The Queen in her Government of Southern Rhodesia,\u201d said Neil Johnson, a senior spokesman for the UK Land Registry.\n\n\u201cAfter independence, this moved to the government of Zimbabwe,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nShould Zimbabwe want the current ownership to be reflected, it needs to apply to the register.\n\nComments revealed that just days before online claims about the London eviction began spreading, The Canberra Times in Australia\u2019s capital reported on the Zimbabwe Embassy in O\u2019Malley being up for sale -- which could explain the association.\n\nThe article notes how Zimbabwe doesn't \u201cseem to have much luck with their embassies in Canberra\u201d as they moved out of a previous home on Timbarra Crescent when the owner sold it.\n\nThe upcoming sale can be confirmed on Australian property website RealestateVIEW going for an asking price of 1,870,000 million dollars. The listing details that they are \u201ccurrently in a fixed lease with great tenants until 2020\u201d, indicating Zimbabwe doesn\u2019t own the property.\n\nAt the end of 2018, news reports said Zimbabwe was among 23 embassies named by the Foreign Office for dodging UK tax bills worth 1.5 million pounds (approximately 1.8 million US dollars).\n\nAs reported by AFP, Zimbabwe\u2019s President Emmerson Mnangagwa this week acknowledged the economic hardships Zimbabweans are suffering and pleaded for patience to allow his government to fix the country's rapidly deteriorating economy.\n\nThe economy has been badly suffering for two decades, but the last 12 months have been the worst decline in 10 years, characterised by shortages of basic goods such as fuel and electricity.\n\nMnangagwa won a July 30 election last year, taking over after 37 years of authoritarian rule under Zimbabwe's founding president Robert Mugabe, who died in hospital in September 2019.", "lang": "en"}
