Your civil servants recognise, that there are over 480,000 young people who are vulnerable from being hidden from that labour market and they are not included in those figures.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s correct that youth unemployment is down by around 40%. The unemployment rate for 16-24s has fallen from 19.6% to 12% since the Conservatives entered government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2010.\n\n921,000 16-24s were estimated to be unemployed in May-Jul 2010, compared to 525,000 now. That\u2019s a fall of 43%.\n\nIn the three months between December 2017 and February 2018 there were:\n\u2022 3.8 million people in work between the ages of 16 and 24 (including 861,000 full-time students with part-time jobs)\n\u2022 525,000 unemployed people of the same age (including 173,000 full-time students looking for part-time work)\n\u2022 2.7 million economically inactive people\u2014meaning they didn\u2019t have a paid job and weren\u2019t looking for one\u2014about two million of these were full-time students\n\nThe Office for National Statistics notes: \u201cIt is a common misconception that all people in full-time education are classified as economically inactive. This is not the case as people in full-time education are included in the employment estimates if they have a part-time job and are included in the unemployment estimates if they are seeking part-time work.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s wrong to say, as an audience member did, that 480,000 young people are excluded from these figures. It seems to be a misunderstanding of a report into a related issue.\n\nThe unemployment figures come from the Labour Force Survey done by the Office for National Statistics, which surveys 40,000 households and 100,000 people every three months to try to get a representative picture of employment in the UK.\n\nThose same figures were used by campaigners to estimate that 480,000 young people are both \u201cout of work and not claiming benefits\u201d and not getting support from job centres. They describe these people as \u201c\u2018hidden\u2019 within \u2018NEET\u2019 statistics\u201d.\n\n\u2018NEET\u2019 refers to people who are Not in Employment, Education, or Training. The report argues that \u201cIt\u2019s also easy to assume that these young people will be receiving support through the benefits system and through Job Centre Plus\u201d, but as not all of them are receiving support, those who aren\u2019t can be described as \u2018hidden\u2019 from the support system.\n\nThose 480,000 people are covered by the Labour Force Survey and included in the employment and unemployment statistics.", "lang": "en"}
