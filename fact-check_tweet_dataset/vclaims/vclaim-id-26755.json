There are other congress leaders along with Rahul Gandhi can also be spotted in the picture. The images of Rahul and Rajiv Gandhi have been circled.\n\nThe caption in the post written in Hindi says Infront of Indira Gandhi\u2019s dead body, Rahul and Rajiv Gandhi are reading kalma, but even then the people of our country think they are Brahmins.\n\nThe archived version is saved here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War room ( AFWA) found this to be a misleading claim. This image is not of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s funeral, but the funeral of Afghan leader and freedom fighter Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan better known as Frontier Gandhi\u2019 or Bacha Khan.\n\nThis viral post had appeared earlier as well on social media. Fact checker Boom live has debunked this claim.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, the viral image can be found in a tweet by a politician of North Waziristan, Mohsin Dawar and in the archived photos of skyscrapercity.com. In both the places it was mentioned that this is the picture of Bacha Khan\u2019s funeral where the Gandhi gamily along with other Congress leaders were present.\n\nKhan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, died Peshwar on January 20, 1988. Rajiv Gandhi along with his family and other leaders attended the funeral in Pakistan. It was reported in several international newspapers like LA Times and United Press International.\n\nIndira Gandhi died on October 31, 1984 and her last rites were performed according to Hindu rituals. Her funeral can be seen in here in this video.\n\nSo the viral post claiming that the Gandhi family followed Islamic rituals in front of India Gandhi\u2019s dead body is misleading. The viral picture showing Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi is from Frontier Gandhi\u2019s last rites and not of India Gandhi.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Don\u2019t get dazzled by these mesmerising fireworks in Mumbai\u2019\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Viral image of PM Narendra Modi wearing keffiyeh is photoshopped", "lang": "en"}
