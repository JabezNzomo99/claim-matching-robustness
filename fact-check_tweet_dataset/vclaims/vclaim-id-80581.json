Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, has called solving California\u2019s water wars one of the toughest challenges of her career. Tougher, she says, than passing a federal assault weapons ban in 1994.\n\nBut the reason the 82-year-old lawmaker says she keeps pushing is simple: The state\u2019s water infrastructure is outdated and its drought emergency persists. She has spearheaded a bill that would pump $1.3 billion into water desalination, recycling and storage projects.\n\nOne of her recent comments about the need for that bill caught our attention.\n\nCalifornia has \"the same water infrastructure from when we were 16 million people,\" Feinstein said in a on April 3, 2016. \"We had better get cracking, because it\u2019s only going to get worse.\"\n\nShe made a similar claim on February 19, 2016 during a speech at a Public Policy Institute of California event.\n\nFeinstein makes the claim at the 27:30 mark in the Public Policy Institute of California video above.\n\nWas Feinstein right? Does California, a state known for innovation, really rely on a plumbing system from generations ago with no substantial upgrades?\n\nView of the Oroville Dam in Northern California.

The backbone of the project, including Lake Oroville and the California Aqueduct, was finished in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nChrisman Pumping Plant at the Grapevine is one of the southernmost along the California Aqueduct.

A number of subsequent facilities were built later, but they\u2019re not the core infrastructure.\"\n\nConstruction on another ambitious project -- the federal government\u2019s Central Valley Water Project, which irrigates the San Joaquin Valley -- started in the late 1930s and was completed in the early 1970s.\n\nLund said California hasn\u2019t built anything as large since then. Some of the state\u2019s major water districts have independently added \"some important pieces\" of storage and conveyance in the last couple of decades, Lund said.\n\nOne example is Diamond Valley Lake in Riverside County, the largest reservoir in Southern California. It was completed in 2000 by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and holds up to 800,000 acre feet of water, \"almost as big as Folsom (Lake),\" Lund noted.\n\nAnother is Los Vaqueros Reservoir, completed in 1998 by the Contra Costa Water District near Brentwood. It holds 160,000 acre feet.\n\nAnd last December, the $1 billion Carlsbad Desalination Project, built by private firm Poseidon Water, started converting ocean water into drinking water for residents in San Diego County. It\u2019s expected to contribute up to 10 percent of the region\u2019s water supply.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s water system is \"not exactly the same,\" as the early 1960s, Lund added. \"But it\u2019s substantially the same in terms of the broad water supply and flood control projects.\"\n\nProjects above represent the bulk of the California State Water Project (SWP) as well as a few additional projects, it does not represent all the water projects in California.\n\nU.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein said California has \"the same water infrastructure from when we were 16 million people.\"\n\nLarge portions of the state\u2019s modern-day water system, including the State Water Project and Central Valley Project were built in the 1960s, when California reached the 16 million population mark.\n\nSome pieces of those systems, which continue to provide water to California\u2019s cities and farms, were completed in the 1970s.\n\nIn more recent decades, water districts have constructed significant storage reservoirs, plus a large desalination plant, to supplement regional supplies.\n\nFeinstein\u2019s comment could have used this additional information.\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear that California has not constructed any new statewide projects to match the scale of those of started in the 1960s.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
