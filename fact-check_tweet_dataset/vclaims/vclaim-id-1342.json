The Home Office told us that this refers to cases where asylum seekers didn\u2019t turn up for their first interview after making an application for asylum in the UK.\n\nThat\u2019s roughly 15% of all the applications which were open between April and June this year.\n\nAs the Home Office pointed out, that doesn\u2019t mean the applicants never turned up for any other interviews, and doesn\u2019t mean that the Home Office has lost track of them. We aren't aware of any published figures on how many asylum seekers are missing.\n\nBut the data isn\u2019t very clear on this\n\nThe Home Office\u2019s raw data just says that \u201cOn Hold\u201d is a \u201csub-category [which] includes pre- and post- decision absconders\u201d, but this doesn\u2019t make it much clearer.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mention that some asylum seekers are in this category because they didn\u2019t turn up to an interview, or say whether or not they later did meet with the Home Office.\n\nIt\u2019s not very surprising that this data could be misinterpreted and taken to mean the number of people who have absconded completely from the asylum process.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what form the Express saw the data in, as it says it came from a Freedom of Information request, rather than the publicly available data.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the Home Office for more information on the figures and whether they have published anything else which explains them.\n\nThe largest proportion of live asylum cases are rejections\n\nThe Home Office recorded over 77,000 asylum cases as 'in progress' between April and June 2016. This is the latest available data.\n\nAlmost 27,000, or 35%, were \u201csubject to removal action\u201d. That means that the people involved haven\u2019t been granted asylum and are either waiting to leave the UK or there\u2019s a delay in arranging this.\n\nThe Home Office says that these delays include \u201cdifficulties in obtaining documents from national governments; dealing with last minute legal challenges; and logistical and practical challenges in removing families in a humane and dignified fashion\u201d.\n\nAround 20,000 cases, or 26%, were awaiting the initial outcome of the application. Another 16% had lodged an appeal to their application and were waiting on the outcome.\n\nOf the remaining 8%, half had received a decision but hadn\u2019t yet appealed, though they still could, and weren\u2019t \u201csubject to removal action\u201d yet. The other half was former unaccompanied minors who had applied for further leave to stay in the UK.", "lang": "en"}
