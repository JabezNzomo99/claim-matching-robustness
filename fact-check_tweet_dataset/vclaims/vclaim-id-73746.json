The post has a Youtube video link where a woman claims that applying a mixture of Vicks and Vaseline in on belly can help in weight loss by reducing belly fat in 3 days. Vishvas News investigated and found the claim to be fake.\n\nA social media post shows a Youtube video link where a woman claims that applying a mixture of Vicks and Vaseline in on belly can help in weight loss by reducing belly fat in 3 days. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVicks Vaporub is a topical Cough Suppressant with medicated vapors which is used to relieve cough symptoms as per the website of Vicks. Nowhere it has been mentioned that it helps in losing weight.\n\n\u201cVaporub does not help with belly fat loss. What it does is it helps reduce water weight. When you lose water in the belly fat area, your belly shrinks, giving the impression of fat loss. However, the water loss is only temporary, and your belly will soon return to being bulgy,\u201d said Dt. Kajal Dularia from Diet Clinic by Kajal Dularia, New Delhi.\n\n\u201cIn fact, there are known common side effects if applied inappropriately. such as skin rashes and irritation, etc.\u201d adds Dt. Kajal.\n\nVishvas News also spoke to Nutritionist and Clinical Dietician Sonali Malik. She said: \u201cBelly fat can be reduced by exercising daily or diet/fasting. The application of Vicks Vaporub or Vaseline would not reduce belly fat. These are nothing but myths.\u201d\n\nThere is no scientific evidence that proves Vicks Vaporub or Vaseline can help in weight loss.\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named Asif Asif. Vishvas News scanned the profile of the user and found that the user is based out of Faisalabad, as his profile suggests.\n\nConclusion: Post Claiming Vicks Vaporub Helps In Reducing Belly Fat In 3 Days Is Fake.", "lang": "en"}
