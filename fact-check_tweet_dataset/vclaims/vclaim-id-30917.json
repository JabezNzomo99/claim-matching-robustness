His stepdaughter confirmed Fox is \u201cALIVE and safe.\u201d\n\nA helicopter carrying Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other people crashed Jan. 26 near Calabasas, California, killing everyone onboard. Shortly after news of the fatal crash broke, misinformation about the identities of the victims spread online.\n\nSome Facebook users, like former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette, claimed that one of the people killed in the crash was Fox, a former Los Angeles Lakers teammate of Bryant\u2019s. Lockette\u2019s post contains a photo of Fox, and the caption reads, \u201cRIP Rick Fox also on board with Kobe.\u201d\n\nHowever, his stepdaughter, Jillian Hervey, confirmed Fox wasn\u2019t onboard on Twitter.\n\n\u201cTo confirm my stepdad Rick Fox is ALIVE and safe! I just got off the phone with my sister,\u201d tweeted Hervey. \u201cWe are all in shock and deeply saddened but please don\u2019t spread false news.\u201d\n\nNBATV reporter Jared Greenberg, also debunked the notion Fox was one of the nine people who died in the crash.
