He not only consistently makes false claims but also repeats them, even though they have been proved wrong. He always insists he is right, no matter how little evidence he has for his claim or how easily his statement is debunked. Indeed, he doubles down when challenged.\n\nDespite the vast intelligence resources available to the leader of a powerful nation, Trump decided to base an unfounded claim on sketchy reporting from Breitbart News that misinterpreted a British report. Even the reporter of the original article said Breitbart got it wrong. FBI Director James B. Comey also said that the claim was not true. The president likes to scream \u201cfake news\u201d and criticize sloppy reporting, yet he has never apologized for this statement, even though there is no evidence to support it.\n\nUnder orders from Trump, then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer marched out to the podium and insisted that Trump had much larger crowds at his inauguration than Barack Obama. Spicer, in his tongue-lashing of reporters, offered little evidence to back up his claims \u2014 and what he did say was wrong. His claims were easily disproved by photo and video evidence. It was an inauspicious start for the presidency.\n\nTrump began making this claim when the shape of the GOP tax legislation was still rather unclear. He kept making this claim even after the bill was drafted and experts determined that, at best, one could say the Trump tax plan would be the eighth-largest tax cut, as measured as a percentage of the size of the economy. Notably, most lawmakers on Capitol Hill don\u2019t make this claim because they know better. Trump also claimed that the tax bill would \u201ccost me a fortune\u201d \u2014 when, in fact, various versions probably would save him millions of dollars.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin repeatedly claimed that the tax cut would pay for itself \u2014 and then some. At one point, he even asserted that the $1.5 trillion plan \u201cwill cut down the deficits by a trillion dollars.\u201d Other Republican leaders also made such irresponsible claims, but Mnunchin promised he would release a comprehensive study proving his claim \u2014 and then never did. All of this happy chatter was poppycock. No credible outside analysis of the plan backed these claims. Generally, economic growth created by a tax cut makes up only about 35 percent of the lost revenue.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) conjured up this striking statistic by accepting a high estimate for the number of people who would lose insurance if Republicans killed the Affordable Care Act without any replacement. (That never happened.) Then he used mortality figures for what happened when people gained insurance in Massachusetts, not if they lost insurance nationwide. The result was the kind of scare statistic that lacks credibility and gives politics a bad name.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) attacked the House GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act by asserting that most people with health insurance could be denied coverage for preexisting conditions. But the proposed law likely did not change the ACA\u2019s guarantee of coverage in most states. Moreover, the individual market has only 18 million participants. Harris came up with her figure by asserting that employer-provided insurance would be affected through a Rube Goldberg-like interaction between federal regulations and the law.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez was one of several Democrats (including Harris) who jumped on reports that there was a provision in the Senate tax bill that provided regulatory clarity on a tax that has never successfully been imposed on private jet management companies. Perez falsely called it a \u201ctax break\u201d that came at the expense of college students. The tax provision is so minor that the cost to the Treasury is under $50,000 a year \u2014 less than the tuition and fees for one student at Harvard University.\n\nObama\u2019s national security adviser Susan E. Rice made this claim during an NPR interview in the waning days of the Obama administration. But then it was proved false when Trump in April launched cruise-missile strikes against Syria for the apparent use of sarin nerve agent against civilians. Rice was referring to weapons declared by Syria. She failed to make clear that Syria\u2019s declaration was believed to be incomplete and, thus, was not fully verified \u2014 and that the Syrian government still attacked citizens with chemical weapons not covered by the 2013 agreement.\n\nAll presidents brag, but few have bragged so often based on so little. Trump claimed credit for jobs returning to the United States \u2014 but the deals were announced before he became president. He said, \u201cI turned around West Virginia\u201d by boosting coal, but he\u2019s using data from only the first two months of his presidency, which reflects a 2016 surge in Asia-Pacific metallurgical coal demand as well as a temporary boost in demand from Australia after Cyclone Debbie. He touted hundreds of billions of dollars in deals reached overseas, but many deals are not concluded and are simply aspirational. He even said he personally created 1 million jobs in United States. Those jobs were created by businesses \u2014 and, in any case, job growth under Trump has lagged compared with the recent Obama years.\n\nFor Trump, time appears to have begun when he took the oath of office. He repeatedly promised that he would punish China for manipulating its currency even though it had not done so for at least two years. Once he became president, he declared he didn\u2019t need to punish China because it suddenly had stopped manipulating its currency (not true.) Before Jan. 20, he said the stock market was in a bubble that would soon pop; afterward, he repeatedly celebrated its rise. As noted above, he also flipped 180 degrees on the accuracy of unemployment statistics.", "lang": "en"}
