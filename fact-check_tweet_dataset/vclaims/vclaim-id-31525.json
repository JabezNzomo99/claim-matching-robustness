It has been shared more than 550 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe text in the purported advisory reads: \"The Department of Health and the Bureau if Immigration has issued a look-out bulletin to all law enforcement agency for the arrest and detention of the person in the picture below. Said person arrived at NAIA from Wuhan, China on board China Eastern Airlines and escaped the Quarantine Area for N-COV.
