True?\n\nOn 15 June 2016, the web site Red Shtick published an article reporting that Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper, had revoked Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s shopping privileges on Amazon.com in retaliation for Trump\u2019s asserting that Bezos was \u201cusing The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don\u2019t tax Amazon like they should be taxed\u201d and announcing that he would revoke the press credentials of Post reporters for his campaign events:\n\nOn Tuesday, one day after the presumptive Republican nominee announced he was nixing access to his campaign events for journalists from the 138-year-old newspaper, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos \u2014 who bought The Washington Post in 2013 \u2014 said Trump would no longer be allowed to purchase anything on the popular shopping site. \u201cBased on his incredibly thin skin and childish behavior toward one of the most respected news outlets in the world, we are hereby revoking the shopping privileges of the con artist and pathological liar known as Donald J. Trump,\u201d Bezos said in a statement about his fellow billionaire.\n\nAlthough this article was circulated on social media by readers who mistook it for a genuine news reports, it was simply a piece of satire from The Red Shtick web site, whose disclaimer notes:\n\nThe Red Shtick is the digital offspring (some might say \u201cbastard child\u201d) of Red Shtick Magazine, which served as the only print satirical publication in Louisiana\u2019s capital city for 8\u00bd years. (That\u2019s like 92 in Baton Rouge satirical publication years.) Like its progenitor, The Red Shtick likes to think of itself as a bold and engaging source of satire and irreverent humor. And while The Red Shtick is completely digital and subsequently limited only by the scope of the worldwide web, it \u2013 like its printed precursor \u2013 has a tendency to focus on happenings in Baton Rouge and the rest of South Louisiana.\n\nWhile Bezos has not responded to Trump\u2019s declaration about revoke press credentials from the Washington Post reporters, Post editor Marty Baron did release a statement about the issue:", "lang": "en"}
