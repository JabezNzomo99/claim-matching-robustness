That relies on the NHS finding the remaining \u00a322 billion in savings.\n\nThe government\u2019s commitment of \u00a310 billion, rather than \u00a38 billion, isn\u2019t as generous as it sounds. The \u00a38 billion requested was to cover a five year period. The \u00a310 billion counts funding for an extra year\u2014the last year of the previous parliament\u2014which wasn\u2019t covered by the NHS\u2019s spending options anyway.\n\nThe NHS is set to get about \u00a38 billion over the course of this parliament, taking inflation into account.\n\nIt\u2019s also not all of what the NHS asked for. The NHS said that its ambitions for savings were only possible \u201cprovided we take action in prevention, invest in new care models, sustain social care services, and\u2026 see...wider system improvements\u201d.\n\nThe government\u2019s \u00a38 billion commitment refers specifically to the NHS England budget. Outside of this, spending on public health is expected to fall over this parliament, and spending on social care is expected to continue to fall short of what\u2019s needed.\n\nThat means total health spending in England\u2014including areas such as public health and social care as well as NHS England\u2014will only rise by \u00a34.5 billion over the same period, according to leading healthcare think tanks.", "lang": "en"}
