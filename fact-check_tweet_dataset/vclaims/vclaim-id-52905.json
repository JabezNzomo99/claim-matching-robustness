But the images are doctored and the papers have dismissed the altered front pages on their official social media accounts. Editors at the three media organisations told AFP Fact Check the false claims were most likely politically motivated as the country\u2019s ruling party grapples with internal tension. They are part of a trend in Kenya of manipulating media content for political mileage.\n\nA post published on May 28, 2020 on a Facebook page named \u201cTruth & Facts\u201d shared front pages of the Daily Nation, the Standard and the Star newspapers with digitally altered headlines.\n\nSimilar posts were shared here and here.\n\nThe newspapers have dismissed the items as \u201cfake\u201d on their respective social media accounts and cautioned readers against believing them.\n\nThe Standard newspaper told AFP Fact Check it had reported a similar matter to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), a semi-autonomous body of the National police service responsible for the investigation of complex criminal cases.\n\nUnder Kenya's tough cybercrime laws, a person found guilty of publishing false information faces a fine of up to five million Kenya shillings (approximately 47,000 USD) and up to 10 years in jail.\n\n\u201cThese are criminals as they are using our brand to spread propaganda\u2026 We are now pursuing legal action,\u201d the Standard\u2019s editor-in-chief Ochieng Rapuro said.\n\nHe added that the fake headlines could harm the paper\u2019s credibility because they create \u201cdoubt on products and what we are doing\u201d.\n\nThe bogus front pages tap into ongoing political strife as Kenya\u2019s ruling Jubilee party faces internal power struggles. The tensions, reported by local media here and here, have resulted in some legislators being de-whipped over what has been described as \u201cindiscipline and party disloyalty\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the Kenyan situation, politics is becoming divisive and intense and it is these political factions that are fighting and using the spaces to spread propaganda,\u201d Rapuro said.\n\nThe Daily Nation\u2019s managing editor Pamela Sittoni also noted the fake front pages seemed part of a political campaign \u201cbecause of the individuals whose names and pictures are being used\u201d.\n\nThe doctored front pages used fonts, colours and layouts identical to the genuine ones. Only the splash story (the main headline) was altered while the other stories appearing on the front page that day remained unchanged.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the front pages that have been produced, they are fairly believable. So it is very easy for someone who does not have a good knowledge of fakes to believe that that is a fake edition of the paper,\u201d Paul Ilado, the head of content at Radio Africa Group which owns the Star newspaper, told AFP Fact Check.\n\nThe doctored headlines allege that the accounts of Kenya\u2019s deputy leader had been frozen as part of a bribery probe and his wife had gone into hiding, while lawmaker Moses Kuria was accused of trying to hammer out secret political deals.\n\nAFP Fact Check has found no official evidence of Ruto currently being investigated. We have reached out to the DCI for comment and will update this article in case of a reply.\n\nWhile Ruto has been acquitted of corruption charges before, his political opponents continue to accuse him of unscrupulous dealings.\n\nMeanwhile, his wife Rachel Ruto appeared publicly on June 1, 2020, during Madaraka Day celebrations -- a holiday to commemorate the day Kenya gained internal self-rule.\n\nKuria, the lawmaker who was described as a \u201cdouble agent\u201d in the post, dismissed the claim (in a local language) as \u201ca desperate political move\u201d.\n\nAfrica Check editor Alphonse Shiundu, who has monitored the misinformation landscape in Kenya for several years, described the manipulated headlines as \u201cstories that have existed on the social media grapevine but cannot be verified\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese are stories that can be believed but cannot be verified. They have existed in the social media grapevine but have never been verified and so for banter, rumour and gossip they make very good fodder. However, if you are looking for news, it is not news because it is not verifiable and you can see it is all made up as there is no proof behind it,\u201d Shiundu told AFP.\n\nManipulation of media content to score political points is a common trend in Kenya. During the 2017 general election, doctored front pages of the Daily Nation claimed a candidate vying for the gubernatorial seat had defected from his party. The claim, which was also circulated as a print edition in a county in western Kenya, aimed to hurt the candidate\u2019s popularity.\n\n\u201cThat was a classic disinformation move to make sure that the candidate did not get a political win. The motive was to delegitimise the politician and sow confusion in the public space so that the voters wouldn\u2019t know what is true and what is false,\u201d Africa Check\u2019s Shiundu commented.\n\nMedia organisations in Kenya are now stamping doctored publications with \u201cfake news\u201d labels and sharing them on their respective social media platforms in a bid to counter widely circulated claims which tend to be confusing to the audience.\n\nReaders are also encouraged to seek information only on the newspapers' official website and social media accounts, where front pages are normally shared.", "lang": "en"}
