Its creators have no apparent affiliation with West.\n\nWest, a self-proclaimed born-again Christian, released his gospel-inspired ninth album \u201cJesus Is King\u201d last month. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and every song landed on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, according to Fox News.

The Daily Caller did not find any media reports tying the rapper to the project financially or otherwise. West has not put out any announcements claiming ownership either.\n\nOriginally sold on Etsy, the book was created by three U.S.-based brothers in 2015, according to NME. In fact, one of them anonymously told the Christian Post in a phone interview that the rapper had no involvement in the project.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a misconception,\u201d the creator told the Christian Post. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting to hear from the guy. We have nothing to do with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Book of Yeezus is an interventionist art, coffee-table novelty, that will appeal to Kanye fans everywhere and those made curious by this enormous cultural phenomenon,\u201d reads a description on its official website.", "lang": "en"}
