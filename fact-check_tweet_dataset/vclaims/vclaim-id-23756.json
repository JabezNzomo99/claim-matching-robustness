He said: \u201cWe collect posts from other pages. It might not be true. We publish many posts and there is a possibility that we post wrong information sometimes.\u201d\n\nDuring the investigation, Vishvas News Team found another post on Facebook that was circulated on July 18, 2018, on a page named \u2018Fun with SP\u2019. The Facebook page \u2018Competecrow.com\u2019 had copied the post from this page \u2018Fun with SP\u2019.\n\nVishvas News contacted Dr. Sanjeev Kumar, C.S.C, D.C.H, M.B.B.S, General Physician (34 years of experience) to know whether the information given in the post is true or false. Dr. Sanjeev Kumar said: \u201cNo, yet another bogus news. However, some medicines may interact with grapes. But not fatal as such. Another matter, I have not yet got any patient link.\u201d\n\nThere are reports that suggest eating grapefruit can interact with some medicines. Grapes and Grapefruit are completely unrelated, botanically speaking, aside from the obvious fact that both are fruits. We did not find any research that claimed fatalities due to the consumption of grapes after eating medicines.\n\nWe used StalkScan to check the profile of the page that posted the image and found many misleading posts.\n\nSome users also commented on the post saying it fake.\n\nLater, we found that the post was deleted from the Facebook page Competecrow.com.\n\nThe viral message claiming that consuming grapes after having medicine can be fatal is false.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
