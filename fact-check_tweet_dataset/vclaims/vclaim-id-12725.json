A spokesperson for Abubakar\u2019s campaign said that he had not mentioned LGBT rights. Abubakar would not be able to sign a treaty on behalf of Nigeria as he is not in the government.\n\nOn Sunday November 11, an article on the website Newsproof.org, shared on their Facebook page with over 230,000 followers, claimed that a Christian group called the Young Christian Forum had denounced the apparent signing of a treaty by Abubakar pledging to legalise same-sex marriage if he wins the presidential elections in February 2019.\n\nThe claims also appeared in Signal NG, The Nigerian Tribune, Global Village Extra and other websites between 10pm on Sunday Night to Monday morning.\n\nOne tweet carrying the claims, retweeted over 130 times, was published by Nkiruka Nistoran, a pro-Biafran activist. Articles, posts and pictures repeating the claim have been shared on Facebook over 1,500 times.\n\nThe websites which carried the claims had not previously reported on the event, but carried reaction to the alleged treaty signing from the Young Christian Forum.\n\nMost of the articles carried quotes from the \u201cnational president\u201d of the forum, Reverend Hosea Adam Damut.\n\nQuotes from Reverend Damut claimed that the group had learnt that the treaty was signed in Dubai, away from Nigeria, in order to hide the development from Nigerians.\n\nHowever there is no evidence that the Youth Christian Forum exists, nor Reverend Damut.\n\nBefore Sunday night, when the articles appeared, there is no online record or reference of either the Youth Christian Forum or Reverend Damut.\n\nIt is unlikely that the national president of a religious organisation would have been making a statement for the first time, or that any evidence of his existence would be unattainable.\n\nAbubakar recently travelled to Dubai for a strategy meeting with officials in the People\u2019s Democratic Party, ahead of the start of the election campaign on November 18.\n\nIn the claims, \u201cReverend Damut\u201d also encouraged Christians to vote against Abubakar, and was quoted as saying that the treaty was a \u201cpre-condition for him to get the support of some pro-LGTB nations\u201d.\n\nThe quotation continued: \"The Young Christian Forum of Nigeria is alarmed that anyone on this earth could compromise the true African and custom of our people by giving in to Satan. This is worse than selling Nigeria\u2019s birth right for a mess of pottage. This is a clear case of inviting God\u2019s wrath on Nigerians.\u201d\n\nSola Sanni, a spokesperson for Abubakar\u2019s campaign, said Atiku has not signed any treaty with any country. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible. He didn\u2019t sign any treaty\u201d, he said, adding that Abubakar has not mentioned LGBT rights in the campaign.\n\nTreaties are agreements between states and Abubakar would not have been able to sign treaties on behalf of Nigeria as he is not in the government.\n\nIt is also unlikely that a country would request a signed declaration of a policy pledge from a presidential candidate. The countries that were claimed to have signed the treaty were not named.\n\nThe articles form part of an emerging theme of misinformation concerning Abubakar, a Muslim politician from North-East Nigeria. Abubakar is seen within Nigeria as a more liberally minded Muslim leader, from Northern Nigeria, a largely Muslim region.\n\nAttitudes to LGBTQ rights are broadly hostile across Nigeria, but particularly amongst conservative religious communities, four years after a bill put forward by President Goodluck Jonathan was passed, banning same-sex marriage, relationships and representative organisations.\n\nIn October, AFP fact-checked similar claims that Abubakar had received support from LGBT organisations in Nigeria, finding no evidence to back them up. They were made by groups quoted on several websites and in two major Nigerian newspapers.\n\nThere is no evidence that the organisations and people quoted in those articles exist, with no previous record of them and no knowledge of their existence from other LGBT advocate groups.", "lang": "en"}
