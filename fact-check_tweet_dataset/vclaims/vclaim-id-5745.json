This claim is false; the quote is fabricated.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nSome posts use this quote: \u201cHollywood is an institutionalized pedophile ring. It is a den of parasites who feast on the blood of children. Every studio in Hollywood is bought and paid for with the blood of innocent children.\u201d\n\nThe comment seems to stem from an article originally published on NewsPunch.com, previously \u201cYour News Wire\u201d. It has since been deleted, but archived versions can be found archive.vn/FyeKl and archive.is/SuTTt .\n\nThe article claims that Gibson explained to guests in a green room after appearing on the Graham Norton Show about the \u201creal nature of Hollywood elites\u201d.\n\nA well-known actor speaking to a crowd of people about this topic would have gathered a lot of attention and been reported by major news organizations. However, a Google search of the quote only brings up social media posts, blogs and meme pages.\n\nThe original article including the quote was written by Baxter Dmitry, a possible pseudonym for an author who has been criticized for writing fake news articles (called out by Poynter here ). The website YourNewsWire has also been criticized for producing inaccurate content ( here ). Dmitry is still a frequent contributor to NewsPunch ( newspunch.com/author/baxter/ )\u200b.\n\nThe article has been copied or slightly altered and published to other websites and blogs, which has led to the wide circulation of the quote. Examples can be seen bit.ly/32OFv1s and archive.vn/lOqN6 .\n\nSome posts make a longer list of claims appearing to stem from the same fabrication, which are beyond the scope of this fact check.\n\nA spokesperson for Mel Gibson told Reuters via email that the claims are \u201c100% fake\u201d.\n\nFalse. This quote attributed to Mel Gibson originated from a fabricated article.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact-checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
