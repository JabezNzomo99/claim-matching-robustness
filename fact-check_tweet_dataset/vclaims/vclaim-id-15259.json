The post was created back in 2017 but is being shared regularly and has crossed over seventy thousand shares. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Kangana Ranaut: \u201cAll the Hindus should place their loudspeakers on the terrace and play Hanuman Chalisa during the time of Azaan, then there will be a roar in the Parliament.\u201d Fact: Kangana Ranaut has not made the statement given in the post. In fact, she gave a statement in favour of Azaan, while responding to a question on Sonu Nigam\u2019s Azaan tweet. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the comments of Kangana on the issue of Azaan on Google, many news articles on the issue can be found in the search results. All those articles refer to the comments made by Kangana while responding to a question on the Sonu Nigam\u2019s Azaan tweet. Nowhere it was found that she commented something against the Azaan. In fact, she commented that she loves the sound of Azaan and also, the opinion of Sonu Nigam should be respected. Also, when the claims made in the post were first spread two years back, SMHoaxSlayer wrote an article saying that Kangana has not made any statement regarding putting Hanuman Chalisa on the loudspeakers at the time of Azaan.\n\nFinally, Kangana has not asked the Hindus to play Hanuman Chalisa on the loudspeakers at the time of Azaan.", "lang": "en"}
