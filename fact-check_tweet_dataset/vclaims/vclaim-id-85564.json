Any potential reduction in funds would come from eliminating local staff \u2014 Russians who in some cases have spent decades working for the United States (and who, because of their prior employment, might have trouble finding new jobs). There also might be severance costs, adding to the tab.\n\nA day later, the White House said the president was only joking, apparently one in a series of jokes on Russia that many listeners thought were intended to be serious. Asked whether he was being sarcastic, Trump responded: \u201cAbsolutely. I think you know that I think you know that.\u201d\n\nWe assume that any reduction in U.S. personnel will result in no savings because they will be reassigned elsewhere. Some Russian staff will need to retained, such as security guards, so the presumption is that three-quarters of the 755-person reduction would be Russian. That means 566 Russians would lose their jobs.\n\nSome of those Russian jobs probably would need to be filled by direct-hire Americans or U.S. contractors, probably at higher salaries, which would quickly reduce any cost savings. That\u2019s what happened in the 1980s during a similar downsizing ordered by Russia. But let\u2019s assume that the reductions are all Russian and that no additional Americans are needed.\n\nThe president, for instance, announced Aug. 21 that he would order additional troops to Afghanistan, with media reports indicating that the number would be at least 3,500 troops. Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said each soldier sent to Afghanistan costs an estimated $1.2 million a year.\n\nBut the diplomatic implications are not easily dismissed. The reduction in staff will put an additional burden on the remaining Americans, who will have less time to monitor \u2014 and interact with \u2014 the Russian government. (David Hoffman\u2019s book \u201cThe Billion Dollar Spy\u201d recounts how a walk-in spy provided documents that ended up saving the United States more than $1 billion in defense procurements.) Already, the State Department has limited consular services, meaning it will take longer for Russians to obtain visas to visit the United States.\n\n\u201cWe did not want to have to reduce the size of our staff in Russia,\u201d said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. \u201cThey do a lot of fantastic work over there. Unfortunately, that is something that the Russian government has told us that we have to do: decrease the number of our staff.\u201d She also noted the burden will fall on the Russian local staff. \u201cThey will now be out of jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Putin claims that he cares about the economy in Russia. That\u2019s a funny way of showing it, caring about the economy by putting your people out of work.\u201d\n\nSince the president now says he was joking, we won\u2019t do a Pinocchio rating. We don\u2019t play gotcha at The Fact Checker. But it\u2019s the kind of humor that leads to misunderstanding and confusion among the American public about the cost of diplomacy. Any money saved is relatively small, especially in the context of the U.S. federal budget, while the potential diplomatic costs are huge. It\u2019s not helpful for the president to claim, even as a joke, that \u201cwe\u2019ll save a lot of money\u201d when U.S. embassy operations are downsized by other nations.", "lang": "en"}
