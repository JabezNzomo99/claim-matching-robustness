Due to the graphic nature of the video, Alt News is not posting it in the article. The duration of the video which has been shared on Facebook is 1:45 minutes.\n\nIn the video, an elderly, bearded man is seen in the frame. He seems to shout \u2018Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2019, following which there is an altercation, and he is then beaten up by some youth. The video has been posted by numerous individuals with the same text- \u201cSee what Muslim youth are doing to this old man its in Delhi Zafarabad for shouting Bharat Mata ki Jai. Why is this not being shown by Media.? Why is this not being made viral by true Indians.\u201d\n\nMeghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy tweeted the video with the claim, \u201cSee what Muslim youth are doing to this old man its in Delhi Zafarabad for shouting Bharat Mata ki Jai.\u201d It has garnered more than 1,700 retweets so far.\n\nTwitter handle @MariaWirth1 also posted the video and claimed, \u201cWhat type of youth are these?Was told that it happened in Jafarabad Seelampur area of NCR.\u201d\n\nAlt News found that the same video had circulated in October this year with the identical narrative. We came across a tweet by a user in October 2019, who had uploaded another video relating to the same incident and claimed that it took place in Bhilwara, Rajasthan. The user claimed that this particular video was shot after the violence.\n\nAlt News then looked at the video and found a shop\u2019s board that read \u201cLady Bag Shopee\u201d. Using Google Maps, we were able to trace the shop to a locality in Bhilwara and hence corroborate that the incident indeed took place in Azad Chowk, Bhilwara.\n\nIn October this year, Alt News had spoken to Bhilwara\u2019s Kotwali police station to get more details about the incident. SHO Yash Deep Bhalla said, \u201cThe person [elderly man] is mentally retarded. His son has filed an FIR against the people who had beaten him up.\u201d We were informed that the son had been advised to admit his father to a mental asylum as the elderly man gets into frequent fights, conflicts and abuses people on the streets. SHO Bhalla further added that the man was beaten up for abusing someone and not for sloganeering.\n\nWe also spoke to the shopkeeper of \u2018Lady Bag Shopee\u2019 who reiterated that the elderly man has a history of getting involved in fights.\n\nA relative of the victim\u2019s family who spoke on condition of anonymity told Alt News that Hotchand Sindhi (victim) had changed his religion (Sindhi) to Sikhism. The member further added that he used to raise slogans on a regular basis and was ill from the last one month and admitted a few days back. At the time, Akali Dal leader Manjinder Sirsa had shared details regarding the case. The five accused were identified as Manoj alias Mulla Sindhi (39), Hemant Ramchandra Nathani (45), Bhagwan Das Sindhi (37), Manzoor Sheikh (31), and Irfan Sheikh(34).\n\nIn November, the relative informed Alt News that all the accused were later released on bail. It may thus be noted that the viral video is from Bhilwara, Rajasthan and is over two months old. This video is unrelated to the recent spate of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 across the country.", "lang": "en"}
