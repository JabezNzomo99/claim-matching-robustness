Nothing illegal about it\n\nWHAT THE LAW SAYS ABOUT THE NATIONAL FLAG:\n\nThe national flag is regulated by the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971; and Flag Code - India.\n\nThe Flag Code of India, 2002 which came into effect from January 26th, 2002 superseded The Flag Code \u2013 India as it existed.\n\nThe Flag Code of India, 2002 is a compilation of the laws, conventions, instructions and guidance related to the display of the national flag.\n\nWHAT THE LAW SAYS ABOUT USAGE AND DISPLAY OF THE FLAG ONLINE\n\nNeither The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 nor the Flag Code of India 2002 contain specifics with regards to usage and display of the flag in digital form.\n\n\"There is no directive.

A government official objected to it and threatened legal action.\n\nIn response, Jindal moved the Delhi High Court in 1995 seeking relaxation of these restrictions on free-speech grounds.\n\nAfter a 7-year long legal battle, The Flag Code, India 1950 was amended after a historic and landmark decision of the Union Cabinet.\n\nThe Union Government approved the recommendations of the inter-ministerial committee and removed the restrictions on the use of the national flag by all Indian citizens from January 26, 2002.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued a final ruling in 2004 that flag-displaying is a fundamental right of all Indians.\n\nSource: Monumental flags: How we got tricolour right\n\nSOME DOs AND DON'Ts ABOUT USING THE FLAG ONLINE\n\nMake sure you do not display the flag in a way that is disrespectful to the country.\n\nThere should be no inscription on the flag\n\nThe flag should not be damaged or disheveled\n\nThe flag must not be displayed with the saffron side down.", "lang": "en"}
