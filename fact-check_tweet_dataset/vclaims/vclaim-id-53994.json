Major broadcast networks covered it extensively, as did digital and print publications. For the week of April 27 to May 3, 2009, swine flu \u201caccounted for almost a third of mainstream media coverage,\u201d according to Pew Research Center.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic came roughly 11 years before the current COVID-19 pandemic that has, as of March 25, killed more than 19,600 people.", "lang": "en"}
