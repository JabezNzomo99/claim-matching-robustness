No, that's not true: a \"fauxtire\" website that publishes invented stories about rappers and celebrities made up the whole thing. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on August 19, 2018 titled \"Kodak Black Arrested Again Just 1 Day After Being Released From Jail On Marijuana and Illegal Firearm Charges\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nFLORIDA - New reports show Florida rapper Kodak Black has been arrested again after only 1 day of being free from a 7 month jail sentence. After serving 7 months in jail for 2 probation violations in Janurary 2018, Kodak Black was released from prison on August 17, 2018, right before being arrested the following day for possession of an illegal firearm and marijuana. Authorities say Kodak Black may face several years in prison for illegal narcotics and firearm while on probation, almost certainly putting his music career in jeopardy.\n\nOn social media like Facebook it looked more or less like this, leading several people to think it was a real news report from a legitimate news website:\n\nHowever no legitimate news source reported on this \"news\", quite the opposite in fact:\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Hanging On Traffic Light And Sh*tting On Cars Passing Underneath\n\u2022 Fake News: Drug Dealer Did NOT Call Cops On Demi Lovato After She Ran Off Without Paying For Heroin\n\u2022 Fake News: Suspect NOT Caught For The Robbing And Kidnapping Of Tekashi69 After Trying To Pawn Jewelry\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman Who Hasn't Had Sex In 120 Days Did NOT Crash Car Just To Feel Choked Again", "lang": "en"}
