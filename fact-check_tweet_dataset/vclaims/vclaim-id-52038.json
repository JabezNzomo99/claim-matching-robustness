Don't believe it.", "author": "verafiles.org", "date": "May 15, 2018, 3:42 PM", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-52038", "url": "http://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-report-claiming-magdalo-preparing-coup", "vclaim": "A false story was published Sept. 12 by website balitaonline.xyz claiming the group Magdalo - which Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV led in mutinees in 2003 and 2007 - is preparing for a coup. It also misleads readers by using outdated and unrelated photos.\n\nThe false story bore the headline, \"BREAKING NEWS: Magdalo ni Trillanes nagpapalakas na para sa kudeta (Breaking news: Trillanes' Magdalo consolidating forces for coup)!\" and carried as its content 10 minutes of a 104-minute Facebook Live video that day of pro-Duterte vlogger Dante Maravillas.\n\nIn his video, Maravillas did not claim Magdalo was building itself up for a coup. He merely echoed a statement President Rodrigo Duterte made the day before about a \"loose conspiracy\" behind his alleged ouster, as he challenged the Armed Forces of the Philippines to stage a \u201cmutiny or a revolution.\u201d\n\nThe Maravillas clip, uploaded by Youtube channel TOKHANG TV, bore a misleading thumbnail which splices together an Associated Press photo of a Magdalo soldier during the November 2007 Manila Peninsula siege, and a July 2009 Agence France-Presse photo of Philippine marine soldiers at a send-off ceremony.\n\nBalitaonline.xyz published its false and misleading story a day after Duterte held a one-on-one interview with his Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
