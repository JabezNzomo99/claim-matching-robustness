We won\u2019t hold our breath that he will drop this talking point, however.\n\nAccording to the October 2017 report on international trade from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, released in December, the United States imported $244.6 billion in goods and services but exported only $195.9 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $48.7 billion for the month. From January to October, the goods and services deficit increased $49.1 billion, or 11.9 percent, from the same period in 2016.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement, as is, does not hold up. It would be more accurate to say that despite a few trade surpluses, the United States has an overall trade deficit thanks to sizable imbalances in exports and imports among a handful of countries.\n\nMore important, Trump has repeatedly claimed that he could negotiate a better deal to bring the deficits down, but the data show that so far Trump has not made progress toward that goal. Still, his proposition raises an important question: Is bringing down the deficit as simple as negotiating better trade deals?\n\nThe most significant source of the trade deficit in the United States is high rates of borrowing from foreign countries because of low domestic savings, according to a 2016 report on trade from the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan research data to Congress. The borrowing allows Americans to \u201cenjoy a higher rate of economic growth than would be obtained if the United States had to rely sole[ly] on domestic savings,\u201d which \u201cboosts U.S. consumption and the demand for imports, producing a trade deficit.\u201d\n\nThe CRS report notes that some policymakers see the large deficit with certain countries as the \u201cunfair,\u201d result of foreign trade policies. But while changes to those policies may have some effect on the trade balance, they would not bring down the overall U.S. trade deficit, because it \u201cis largely a reflection of the level of U.S. savings.\u201d Without changes to U.S. consumption and savings, the researches note, \u201can increase in U.S. exports would likely result in an increased demand for imports, and the overall U.S. trade deficit would likely remain relatively unchanged.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s focus on the deficit as a matter of who buys or sells more simplifies the issue and obscures the fact that the overall deficit is largely driven by borrowing. But that does not mean some criticisms of the trade deficit are without merit. The CRS researchers point out that the trade deficit creates a \u201cdual problem for the economy\u201d \u2014 it generates debt that must be paid back in the long run; and current generations must pay interest on that debt.\n\nAnother key factor in the trade deficit is the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. The strength of the dollar makes imported goods cheaper for U.S. consumers, which, in general, increases imports and decreases exports. And many countries have increasingly turned to the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, meaning it is used by foreign governments in international transactions and investments. And this use of the U.S. currency further strengthens the dollar, making U.S. exports less competitive.\n\nRobert E. Scott, a senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said in a column that renegotiating trade deals alone would have little impact on these currency exchanges. (Scott penned the column after Trump cited Scott\u2019s research on trade during a campaign rally in 2016.) Instead, Scott argues, the United States needs to directly intervene in the currency markets to address the misuse of U.S. currency by foreign governments, and thus help reduce the trade deficit.\n\nBut surpluses aside, Trump also claims that he can turn the trade deficit around by negotiating better trade deals with other nations. But over the course of his first year in office, the trade deficit has increased. Indeed, as we have explained, his claim once again reveals how little the president understands about the key factors for the trade deficit.", "lang": "en"}
