In neighbouring Gwynedd, it\u2019s between \u00a3103,000 and \u00a3110,000.\n\nThe basic salary for a Member of Parliament anywhere in the UK is \u00a376,000.\n\nAll these salaries are for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2017. The gap used to be wider. In 2014, for example, MPs were paid \u00a367,000 and the Chief Executive at Anglesey \u00a3141,000\u2014so about twice as much.\n\nAnd exceptionally in 2010/11, when an Interim Managing Director was appointed to the council by the Welsh government, the salary was over three times that of an MP. The gentleman in the audience may have been thinking of that.\n\nCouncil Chief Executives also oversee elections in their area, for which they can get extra fees. The Anglesey Chief Executive received an extra \u00a33,000 for these duties a few years ago, according to a report by a Welsh Assembly committee, although we\u2019re not sure how typical that is for this council. We\u2019ve asked.\n\nWhatever the situation is in these specific councils, the audience member may have a point in general. The average county council Chief Executive was paid something close to three times as much as an MP in 2012/13, according to a report by a committee of the latter using data from IDS Thomson Reuters, although they doesn\u2019t specify whether it covers Wales as well as England\n\nBut comparing the salaries of local government senior managers with public representatives isn\u2019t comparing like with like. They\u2019re very different jobs.\n\nIncreases in MPs\u2019 salaries are linked to average earnings across the whole of the public sector by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, although it points out that the job is \u201cin many respects unique and performed in different ways by different MPs\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
