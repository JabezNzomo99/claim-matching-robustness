In this quote, it is claimed that Khan stated, \u201cI would leave India if Modi becomes the PM of this country.\u201d\n\nThe text reads, \u201cShah Rukh Khan, you once said that \u201cI would leave India if Modi becomes the PM of this country.\u201d So Mr Khan, I guess you would be a Man of your words. Show us that you got *****. Share this picture so much that this douche apologises for his words.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u0915\u093f\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u092f\u0947 \u0936\u093e\u0939\u0930\u0941\u0916 \u0939\u0915\u0932\u093e \u0926\u093f\u0916\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u092c\u094b\u0932\u0928\u093e \u0915\u093f 5 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u0939\u094b\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u094b \u0906 \u0917\u090f, \u0905\u092d\u0940 \u0924\u0915 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u091b\u094b\u095c\u093e \u0907\u0938\u0928\u0947 (If anyone comes across this stammerer Shah Rukh Khan, tell him that it\u2019s been 5 year, why hasn\u2019t he left India?)\u201d read a post by Facebook page I Support Narendra Bhai Modi Bjp (@bjpalindia). The aforestated caption was affixed to a purported screenshot of a Sudarshan News broadcast which showed a \u2018tweet\u2019 by Shah Rukh Khan, saying \u2013 \u201cIf Modi becomes Prime Minister, I will not only leave Twitter but also leave India.\u201d This post drew over 2,500 shares at the time of writing this article.\n\nAnother Facebook page BJP Khargone Barwani shared the identical post as well, which drew over 1,100 shares. A few individual users on Facebook also circulated the alleged tweet by the Bollywood actor.\n\nA 2014 photoshopped tweet attributed to Shah Rukh Khan gave birth to the claims viral on social media.\n\nThe tweet (now deleted) was made by a parody Twitter handle @jamsrk. If one zooms in on the tweet, the \u2018j\u2019 instead of an \u2018i\u2019 can be made out.\n\nAt around 10 am on May 18, 2014, actor Kamal Rashid Khan (KRK) had tweeted if there was any truth behind the statement made by Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nAfter the fake tweet was widespread, Khan put out a clarification on May 19, 2014, at around 12:30 AM that it wasn\u2019t him who made the statement.\n\nLater, KRK claimed that it was his statement \u2013 \u201cPpl pls note I only said tat I will leave India if Modi Ji will become PM I have left India. SRK Salman or Aamir didn\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d\n\nThe incident was also reported by the media, including Hindustan Times and The Times of Indiaand Deccan Chronicle.\n\nAlt News was unable to locate the Sudarshan News screengrab presently viral on social media. However, the media outlet indeed broadcast a show on the fake tweet, and it was anchored by its Editor-in-Chief Suresh Chavhanke.\n\nSudarshan News had also tweeted about that same day \u2013 \u201cSudarshan News\u2019 Chief Editor Suresh Chavhanke\u2019s attack on Shah Rukh Khan (translated)\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an isolated instance when the media outlet spread misinformation. Alt News has found several cases in the past when Sudarshan News and its CMD Suresh Chavhanke circulated fake news, often communal in nature.", "lang": "en"}
