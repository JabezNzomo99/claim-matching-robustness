The team beat the Netherlands 2-0 to secure the title, with Rapinoe scoring a goal in the 61st minute to break a scoring drought.\n\nRapinoe scored six goals during the whole tournament, earning her the award of top goal scorer. After scoring, she often makes her now-signature celebratory pose: arms proudly outstretched.\n\nThis image depicts her post-goal pose, but with the addition of a large, blue \u201cTrump 2020\u201d flag in her left hand.\n\nRapinoe has been outspoken in her political beliefs, from not joining her teammates in singing the national anthem to advocating for equal pay for female soccer players. In an interview posted on social media, she said she had no plans to go to the White House if the national team won.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to the f*****g White House,\u201d said Rapinoe in short interview clip with Eight by Eight, a soccer magazine.\n\nRapinoe has made her opinion of President Donald Trump very clear, which makes the image of her holding a pro-Trump flag immediately suspect.\n\nThe Daily Caller found the original photograph, taken by the Associated Press on June 28. No flag in sight, it shows Rapinoe celebrating a U.S. goal during the quarterfinal match against France, according to the caption.\n\nAnother Facebook user posted the doctored image with a more telling caption: \u201cI just want this to go viral to tick her off!!\u201d That post has been shared more than 200,000 times since it was originally posted on July 2.", "lang": "en"}
