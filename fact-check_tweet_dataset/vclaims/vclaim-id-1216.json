This claim is false.\n\nText in the post states that the word picnic was used to \u201cdescribe festive events attended by racist whites.\u201d It adds that at these meetings, Black men released from jail would be \u201ccaught by mobs of white men who would lynch or burn them alive in front of cheering crowds.\u201d The post alleges the word picnic itself stems from the \u201cN-word\u201d.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here , here and here .\n\nAccording to Dr David Pilgrim, author of several books on the history and cultural symbols of the Jim Crow era, the word picnic derives from the 17th century French word \u201cpique-nique,\u201d a term used to describe a social gathering in which attendees each contributed with a portion of food or another useful item ( here ).\n\nPilgrim writes that a 1692 edition of Origines de la Langue Francoise de Menage includes the word pique-nique. Since the derivate word, picnic, did not appear in the English language until around 1800, this suggests it did not originate in the U.S.\n\nHowever, the settings in which the lynching of Black people occurred in the U.S. during the 19th and 20th centuries could have been appropriately described as picnic-like ( here ).\n\nHistorians have documented that killings by white mobs frequently became public spectacles ( here ). A project by the Equal Justice Initiative entitled \u201cLynching in America\u201d notes that during the late 1800s and early 1900s, \u201cwhite men, women, and children present watched the horrific murders while enjoying deviled eggs, lemonade, and whiskey in a picnic-like atmosphere.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe word picnic does not originate from these brutal killings, but there is sufficient evidence to corroborate that these often occurred in gatherings that could be referred to as picnics.\n\nFalse. The word picnic does not originate from the lynchings of African Americans.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
