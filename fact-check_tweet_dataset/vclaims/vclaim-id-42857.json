The claim is false; the photo in fact shows an environmental protest outside a train station in Germany.\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook here on May 3, 2020. It has been shared more than 8,800 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s Burmese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cPeople who say they are not afraid of Corona in Myanmar, look at Ecuador's situation.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nAs of May 7, 2020, Ecuador had recorded at least 31,881 cases of COVID-19 and at least 1,569 deaths, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data.\n\nThe country has become one of Latin America's coronavirus epicenters. Front line medics in the city of Guayaquil have told AFP of the daily horrors they face after the health system collapsed.\n\nThe photo was also shared more than 440 times on Facebook here on April 18 alongside a similar claim that it shows dead bodies in Europe during the pandemic that were not buried or cremated for religious reasons.\n\nThe claims are both false.\n\nThe photo in fact shows a \u201cdie-in\u201d protest organized by Extinction Rebellion, an international environmental activist group, outside the M\u00fcnster (Westf) Hauptbahnhof train station in the German city of M\u00fcnster. The location can be seen below on Google Maps.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading Facebook posts (L) and a Google Map screenshot of the area (R) with the corresponding yellow Deutsche Post mailboxes circled in red:\n\nOn February 7, Extinction Rebellion\u2019s M\u00fcnster chapter promoted the demonstration on Instagram here. The post notes that the first place the activist will \u201cdie at\u201d is the train station.\n\nFootage of the protest was also published on YouTube here on February 8. The video\u2019s German headline translates to English as: \"\u2018Die-In\u2019 campaign by Extinction Rebellion M\u00fcnster against global warming\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s description adds that the group \u201cstarted at the main train station, where activists from Extinction Rebellion dropped and remained motionless for about 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading Facebook post (L) and screenshots from the YouTube video (R) with the corresponding features circled:", "lang": "en"}
