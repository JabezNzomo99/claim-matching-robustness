It has been shared by several individuals on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. The claim has been circulated in the form of a newspaper clipping.\n\nFacebook page \u2013 I Support Narendra Bhai Modi Bjp had also shared the clipping with an identical narrative.\n\n1. Alt News did a Google search with key words given in the poster and found that no such media report exists on the internet.\n\n2. Another search about DNA expert named Martin Sizo also yields no search results. We also couldn\u2019t find a news report on such a press conference held by a DNA expert in any publication.\n\nIn all probability, if at all there was a slightest doubt about Rahul Gandhi\u2019s lineage, given his prominence in the Indian political system, the issue would have been echoed by a multitude of opposition parties, which is NOT the case here. Moreover, the issue would have been on the radar of mainstream media organisations. In conclusion, the poster shared on social media with the narrative questioning Rahul Gandhi\u2019s DNA is fake.", "lang": "en"}
