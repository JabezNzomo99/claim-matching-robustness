No senators have changed their party affiliation as a result of impeachment.\n\nThe website AR News Room, which appears to republish news from various sources, posted the article on Dec. 21. But the article, titled \u201c4 Democrat Senators Are Turning Republican Because They Oppose Impeachment,\u201d actually originated on Bustatroll.org, a satire website.\n\n\u201cEverything on this website is fiction,\u201d reads its \u201cAbout Us\u201d page. \u201cIt is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.\u201d (RELATED: No, Fox News Didn\u2019t Stage A Photo Of Trump Visiting Troops In Afghanistan)\n\nThe satirical article identifies four individuals who have decided to switch parties in the Senate: Jack Layton of Michigan, Christian Clark of Washington, Gordon Campbell of California and Kareem Jabari of New York. Trump\u2019s impeachment spurred them to join the Republican Party, according to the article.\n\nThree of the individuals are not U.S. senators but rather former Canadian politicians \u2013 Layton served as the leader of Canada\u2019s New Democratic Party from 2003 until his death in 2011, while Campbell and Clark served as the premier of British Columbia from 2001 to 2011 and 2011 to 2017, respectively. Jabari appears to be a fictional character.\n\nNo U.S. senators have changed parties in response to Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nBoth articles likely play on the news of New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew\u2019s party switch from Democrat to Republican in the wake of his refusal to vote for the president\u2019s impeachment. Van Drew announced his plans to switch parties Dec. 19, the day after the House voted to impeach Trump on two counts.\n\nThough Bustatroll.org has a clear disclaimer noting that it\u2019s a satire website, AR News Room failed to issue a similar warning. It portrays the article as real.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
