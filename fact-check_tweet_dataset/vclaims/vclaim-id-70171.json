Chabot is locked in a tight race with Democratic challenger Aftab Pureval to claim the seat in Ohio\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\n\nThe ad says Chabot \"voted to cut health care for kids, affecting up to half the families at Cincinnati\u2019s own Children\u2019s Hospital.\"\n\n\"While they shouldn\u2019t have to worry, some kids can\u2019t escape it. But Steve Chabot voted to cut health care for kids, affecting up to half the families at Cincinnati\u2019s own Children\u2019s Hospital. The insurance industry that gave Chabot\u2019s campaign over $700,00 got their way. Just like they did when Chabot voted to rollback protections for pre-existing conditions. Steve Chabot listens to them, not us.\"\n\nSo did Chabot actually vote to deny health care to kids? And would it have impacted around half of the patients at Cincinnati\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital?\n\nWe wanted to find out.\n\nIt is accurate Chabot voted for the GOP-backed American Health Care Act, though the bill didn't pass. If passed, the measure would have rolled back provisions from President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, including protections for people living with pre-existing conditions and cuts to Medicaid, on which many poor children rely. About half of the patients at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center are covered through Medicaid. But we don't know how many children specifically would have been affected.\n\nIn 2017, Steve Chabot voted to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe House Majority PAC noted that Chabot\u2019s vote in question was related to the American Health Care Act, the GOP-backed plan to overhaul Obamacare. The measure narrowly passed the house with a 217-213 margin before it failed in the Senate.\n\nAlong with leaving it up to states how much of the ACA should be overturned, the AHCA would have reduced $880 billion in Medicaid spending over a 10-year period, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe AHCA would have retained some components of Obamacare, but also would have rolled back state-by-state expansions of Medicaid, which covers millions of low-income children.\n\nMore than 35 million children are enrolled in Medicaid in 2018, constituting the largest group in the program, although they represent a smaller share of expenditures compared to other groups. In Ohio, Medicaid covers two in every five children.\n\nThe AHCA would have altered Medicaid\u2019s financing, ending the current federal-state partnership and converting the program to a per-capita or block grant starting in 2020.\n\nFollowing the House vote on the bill in May 2017, research released by Avalere Health, a Washington D.C.-based healthcare consulting firm, estimated how much child health could be threatened if Medicaid faced the changes laid out in the bill.\n\nThe organization found that, nationally, children\u2019s Medicaid would get hit with reduced funding of $43 billion over 10 years under a per-capita cap model, with reductions in spending becoming more dramatic each year.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also raised Medicaid\u2019s minimum income eligibility limit for children from 100 to 138 percent of the poverty line. This was done in the 34 states, including Ohio, that expanded Medicaid under the ACA. It allows children with families incomes below 138 percent of the poverty line, regardless of age, to be covered by Medicaid. The AHCA plan would lower the eligibility level back down to 100 percent of the poverty.\n\nWould half the children at Cincinnati\u2019s Children Hospital be affected?\n\nIt's unclear. The House Majority PAC refers to a WCPO Cincinnati story in which a doctor at Cincinnati\u2019s Children Hospital, Dr. Ray Bignall, said that the bill would have hurt children because of its cuts to Medicaid, on which poor children rely.\n\nHe also said that about 50 percent of the young patients at the hospital are covered through Medicaid.\n\nThe hospital is similar to other Children\u2019s hospitals across the country, which depend on Medicaid funding as half of the patients at these institutions are also enrolled in the program.\n\nBecause these hospitals need the money to keep operations afloat, losing covered benefits and enrollees could lead to decreased revenues and ultimately shrink the types of services the hospitals are able to provide children, regardless of their insurance.\n\nChabot\u2019s campaign told us that the WCPO story is about the Senate version of the bill, not the House version, and that the House bill \"did not treat Medicaid the same way.\" In the same story, Dr. Bignall also is quoted saying, \"The cuts are essentially just as deep as they were before. It seems that this is a core element of the legislation that isn't going anywhere.\"\n\nIt is true that there were changes in the Senate bill, but both versions would have ultimately phased out the extra money the federal government provides to states as an incentive to expand Medicaid eligibility, and both would put the program on a budget, ending the open-ended entitlement that now exists.\n\nSeveral analyses have found the House bill\u2019s funding plan would lead to extensive shortages in every state, but the Senate version would deepen long-term Medicaid cuts even further.\n\nThe House Majority PAC says Chabot voted to take away children\u2019s health care, impacting about half of the kids at Cincinnati\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nIt revolves around Chabot\u2019s vote for the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which was estimated to have reduced $880 billion in Medicaid spending over the next 10 years, a program on which millions of poor children rely.\n\nIf the House (or Senate) version of AHCA had passed, the financial restructuring of Medicaid could have resulted in severe cuts to the program, and thus, children losing health coverage. But the exact impact on patients at Cincinnati\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital is unclear, and Chabot's vote wasn't specific to the hospital.", "lang": "en"}
