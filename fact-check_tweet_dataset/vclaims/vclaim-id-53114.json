But I believe the benefits are greater than the risks.\u201d\n\nWhile Fauci did say the quote attributed to him, it was not in reference to funding a lab in Wuhan. He was actually talking about the publication of a paper about the H5N1 bird flu.\n\nFauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, has been a target of false rumors during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOne such rumor being shared on Facebook alleges that, while talking in 2014 about funding a Wuhan lab, Fauci said, \u201cThere\u2019s always a risk. But I believe the benefits are greater than the risks.\u201d While the remark is correctly attributed to Fauci, the context surrounding the quote is inaccurate.\n\nThe New York Times quoted Fauci as making the statement in 2012 \u2013 not 2014 \u2013 while talking about the publication of a research paper that identified mutations of the H5N1 bird flu. There were fears that the research paper, published in the journal Science, could be used by a \u201crogue scientist\u201d to create a biological weapon, according to the outlet.\n\nAn internet search conducted by the Daily Caller found no evidence of Fauci making that comment in 2014 in connection to a lab in Wuhan.

The National Institutes of Health told the Caller in an email that they do \u201cnot discuss details of the decision making process regarding specific grant awards.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
