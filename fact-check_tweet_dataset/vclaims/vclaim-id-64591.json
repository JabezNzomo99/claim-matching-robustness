Exaggerations about Ebola were PolitiFact\u2019s 2014 Lie of the Year. And now rumors about Zika, a virus linked to birth defects, are taking the Internet by storm.\n\nOne of the claims goes something like this: Zika is caused by genetically modified mosquitoes, a testament to what happens when man tampers with nature or a purposefully manufactured weapon for population control.\n\nAs Snopes and Discover have noted, this idea appears to have originated from a post published Jan. 25 to the subreddit r/conspiracy \u2014 our first red flag. But since then, the claim has been circulated by media outlets ranging from Infowars and Natural News to the Daily Mail, the Mirror, Russia Today and Fox News.\n\nOne version can be found in a popular YouTube video entitled: \"Bioweapon! Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic) funded by Gates.\"\n\nThe video explains that British biotechnology company Oxitec engineered genetically modified mosquitoes to fight the spread of dengue fever and other diseases with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Oxitec recently released these mosquitoes in Brazil, \"where we have this explosion of Zika,\" the video says. \"Writing\u2019s on the wall, folks.\"\n\nWe wondered if there is any truth to the notion that Zika is being spread by transgenic mosquitoes.\n\nIn a word, no. Epidemiologists told us the rumor is baseless. The mosquitoes in question wouldn\u2019t have been capable of starting the outbreak in 2015, and the geographic correlation offered doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the organization has seen no evidence suggesting that Zika is linked to genetically modified mosquitoes.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know of any scientific evidence for this rumor, or any obvious way to do this that would be more efficient than natural transmission,\" said Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.\n\n\"I cannot state more emphatically that I believe this theory to be absolutely untrue,\" said Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe claim\u2019s first problem is history. Zika didn\u2019t suddenly appear after genetically modified mosquitoes were released. The virus was first documented nearly seven decades ago in Uganda and has cropped up many times over the years.\n\nOn April 18, 1947, researchers studying jungle yellow fever isolated the virus from mosquitoes and named it after the Zika Forest where it was found. Though Zika had never been seen before, \"it had probably lurked chronically in African monkeys, or some other native reservoir, for millennia,\" reports National Geographic.\n\nIn the next half century, evidence of Zika was found in human fluids in a number of African and Asian countries, but only 14 cases of the human disease were documented.\n\nZika was detected outside of the two continents for the first time in 2007. The small island nation of Yap saw 108 confirmed or probable cases of the disease.\n\nThe second outbreak of Zika hit French Polynesia, another small island in the Pacific, in 2013. About 11 percent of the population (28,000 cases) were infected.\n\nIn May 2015, Brazil reported the first cases of Zika infection along with a surge in infants born with microcephaly, a birth defect in which baby\u2019s head is abnormally small. There are now an estimated 440,000 to 1.3 million cases in the country and the disease has spread across Latin America.\n\nThe claim\u2019s second problem is that genetically modified bugs couldn\u2019t have been responsible for the 2015 Zika outbreak.\n\nMany mosquito species in the Aedes genus (africanus, apicoargenteus, luteocephalus, vitattus, furcifer, albopictus, hensilli and polynesiensis) can transmit the Zika virus, but the main vector is Aedes aegypti. This particular mosquito, common in tropical areas around the world, also spreads yellow fever, dengue fever and chikungunya.\n\nTo combat dengue fever, Oxitec engineered Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to produce a lethal protein and self-destruct. Females, which bite, are destroyed in the lab while males, which don\u2019t bite and thus can\u2019t transmit diseases, are released into the wild. They mate with local, non-GM females and the self-destruct gene is passed onto offspring.\n\nOxitec spokesman Matthew Warren told PolitiFact that the mosquitoes typically self-destruct within one to four days, and the gene disappears from the population about 12 weeks after the initial release.\n\n\"This means that offspring of the mosquito do not survive,\" said Durbin of Johns Hopkins. \"Therefore, the progeny of these mosquitoes, even if infected with Zika, would not survive to transmit Zika.\"\n\nThe claim\u2019s third problem is the geographic correlation, which besides not being the same thing as causation doesn\u2019t actually match up.\n\nThe first Brazilian cases of Zika reported in May 2015 were in Cama\u00e7ari, a district in the northeastern state of Bahia that\u2019s hundreds of kilometers away from the Oxitec trial sites. The biotech firm released the genetically modified mosquitoes in Juazeiro, which is roughly 490 kilometers from Cama\u00e7ari, and in Jacobina, about 340 kilometers away.\n\nIt\u2019s also very unlikely, if not impossible, that Zika-carrying Oxitec mosquitoes made their way to Cama\u00e7ari. For one, the typical Aedes aegypti mosquito can fly a maximum of 200 meters to 440 meters.\n\nFor another, the trials took place months and years before the Cama\u00e7ari outbreak (between May 2011 and September 2012 in Juazeiro and in Jacobina between June 2013 and December 2014). So \"even if an Oxitec mosquito \u2018hitched a lift,\u2019 \" it would have died long before, Warren said.\n\nBeginning in April 2015, Oxitec did release mosquitoes in Piracicaba, in the southeastern state of S\u00e3o Paulo \u2014 about 2,000 kilometers from Cama\u00e7ari and 1,900 kilometers from the epicenter of the disease in Recife.\n\nAccording to the state\u2019s department of health, S\u00e3o Paulo has reported only 20 cases of microcephaly as of Jan. 20, 2016 (though there is some suspicion over the official tally) while Piracicaba itself has two confirmed and 12 suspected cases of Zika.\n\nRather than spreading Zika, Oxitec mosquitoes could actually help fight the disease, as NPR, CNN, and the New York Times have noted. The self-destructing bugs have reduced virus-carrying mosquito populations in Brazil, Panama and the Cayman Islands by 80 to 90 percent, according to studies commissioned by the company. (Critics say these results are exaggerated.)\n\nExperts said the current explosion of Zika in Brazil is more likely due to the lack of barriers, higher population density, increased mobility and novelty of the disease rather than mutant mosquitos.\n\nWhereas the disease was confined by the ocean and small populations in Yap and French Polynesia, Durbin pointed out, Zika could spread through a huge amount of territory and infect way more humans in Brazil.\n\nImmunity and resistance to the disease has been documented in Nigeria and Indonesia. But in the Americas, Zika is basically a \"virgin soil epidemic,\" said Morse of Columbia. (So were smallpox to Native American populations in the United States and yellow fever to European colonialists in West Africa.)\n\n\"I think it\u2019s extremely likely these introductions are inadvertent and not intentional because historically we\u2019ve seen this kind of thing happen many times,\" Morse said.\n\nOne final note. The viral image focuses part of its criticism on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation helped fund the genetically modified mosquito program. The foundation also is helping support PolitiFact\u2019s efforts to fact-check claims about global health and development. Gates has no input over what we fact-check or the rulings we issue.\n\nAn Internet rumor propagated in a YouTube video claims that the \"Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic).\"\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that this is true. The argument offered \u2014 where the Zika outbreak occurred matches up with where the transformed mosquitoes were released \u2014 doesn\u2019t hold up. What\u2019s more, the mosquitoes in question were specifically engineered to self-destruct before they can spread viruses.\n\nThis claim is both inaccurate and ridiculous.
