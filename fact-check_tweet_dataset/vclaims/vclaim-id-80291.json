The image is manipulated from an original image on the wrestler\u2019s Instagram feed that does not contain any political slogans.\n\nThe photograph appears to show Nurmagomedov holding a black t-shirt that bears the hashtag #2019GANTIPRESIDENT.\n\nThe slogan is part of a campaign that opposes Widodo\u2019s reelection bid in 2019.\n\nThe athlete is flanked by two men, one of them wears a black shirt that appears to have the words: \u201cAL-FATIHAH NOT ALFATEKA\u201d across it. This refers to a debate over whether the Indonesian leader mispronounced the name of a Muslim verse at a recent event.\n\nThe image was posted by Facebook page Masa Era Baru on October 11 with a caption that said: \u201cThank God, We got new support from fellow Muslim from overseas, Amen.\u201d It was shared more than 1,000 times.\n\nA reverse image search found the original photograph, which has been widely shared in Indonesia, was first posted by the wrestler on Instagram on October 1, 2018.\n\nThe original photo shows Nurmagomedov holding a black shirt which says: \u201cTRUST ME, I\u2019M A CHICKEN WHISPERER\u201d. The man on his right is wearing a largely plain black shirt.\n\nNurmagomedov kept his UFC lightweight crown after beating his Irish rival Conor McGregor in an October 9 match, followed by a post-match brawl.\n\nNurmagomedov has previously spoken about his Muslim faith.\n\nThe Nurmagomedov-McGregor fight attracted significant attention in Muslim-majority Indonesia partly due to the Irishman\u2019s pre-match insults attacking the Russian\u2019s religion and family.", "lang": "en"}
