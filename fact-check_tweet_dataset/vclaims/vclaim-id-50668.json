In fact, the video was filmed in August after a fatal oil tanker explosion in Tanzania.\n\nAttention: this post contains images that readers may find distressing.\n\n\u201cGraphic heartbreaking aftermath scenes of burnt foreign nationals, especially Nigerian and their properties on South African soil in the ongoing #Xenophobia attacks. NOTE: VIEWERS DISCRETION ADVICED #SayNoToXenophobia #OfieNewsRoom,\u201d reads the caption on one Facebook post carrying the footage. The post, which we\u2019ve archived here, has been shared over 2,600 times since it was published on September 3.\n\nMultiple posts sharing the footage alongside a similar narrative have appeared online, including here and here.\n\nAs reported by AFP, at least twelve people have been killed since the start of the month in a wave of violence mainly targeted at foreigners and foreign-owned businesses in and around South Africa's Johannesburg.\n\nThe violence resulted in the destruction of hundreds of shops in South Africa, while the Nigerian government has said it is repatriating about 600 of its citizens who no longer feel safe in the country.\n\nThe video is made up of two pieces of footage: the first showing charred bodies on the ground, and the second showing thick black smoke from a large fire rising into the sky.\n\nThe first sign that the first part of the footage was not filmed during this month\u2019s South African unrest is that it shows more dead bodies than the overall death toll of 12. Those killed in the South African violence have also lost their lives in different locations -- the scene here would suggest that all 12 must have died in the same place.\n\nSome readers commenting on the posts said they didn\u2019t believe the footage was filmed in South Africa, but in Tanzania after a fatal fuel truck explosion.\n\nAn internet search proved they were correct.\n\nFifty-seven people were burned to death on August 10 after a fuel tanker exploded near Morogogo in Tanzania. As reported by AFP in the days after the explosion, more people later succumbed to their injuries and the death toll climbed to 100.\n\nThe explosion engulfed a crowd of people who were siphoning petrol from the overturned tanker, many of them motorbike taxi drivers who had rushed to the scene.\n\nOfficials said the explosion was triggered when a man tried to take the truck's battery, creating sparks that ignited the fuel.\n\nComparing an Al Jazeera video of the Tanzanian accident that had been shared in the comments on the misleading post, and a tweet containing a longer, more graphic version of the video, AFP confirmed that the footage really is from the Tanzanian tragedy.\n\nA woman wearing a yellow hoodie with a black headscarf can be seen in both videos, along with a pile of charred motorbikes.\n\nThe second part of the video is from South Africa\n\nThe second part of the video really was filmed during the recent violence in South Africa. It shows a woman in a pink shirt crying frantically that her baby has been killed in the fire seen in the background.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead, there he is.. [inaudible], they killed my child, why did they kill my child? Why didn't they kill me?\u201d the woman cries out in Tswana.\n\nNumerous posts shared the video of the crying woman on social media, sympathising with the mother and condemning South Africans for the unrest, as seen here and here.\n\nComments on some of the posts said the location was Marabastad, an informal settlement in Pretoria which was affected by the anti-foreigner violence. And a basic search of \u201cMarabastad fire\u201d finds a news report by eNCA on Sept 2.\n\nThe reporter explains how social media posts had said a baby had been burnt to death, but in fact it turned out that it was a charred doll that had been found. \u201cNo one was harmed,\u201d he says. The mother from the blurry video is seen once again wearing pink in the news report -- however, she carries her baby on her back.\n\nThe mother introduces the man she says rescued the baby from one of the burning homes.\n\nNumerous videos and images were shared on social media this month, purporting to show the anti-foreigner attacks. However many of them, like this, were either old content, visuals from other countries or videos that were unrelated to xenophobia attacks at all -- further fuelling tensions over xenophobic attacks in South Africa.\n\nAdditional misleading posts saying that South Africa\u2019s Nigeria embassy had been bombed and that Nigerians were being deported en masse have also been shared widely on social media since the start of the month.", "lang": "en"}
