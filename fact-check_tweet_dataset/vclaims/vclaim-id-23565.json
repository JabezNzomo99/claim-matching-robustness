Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim 1: The image posted is taken at the funeral procession of victims killed in the Sri Lankan Easter bombings (2019), allegedly carried out by the ISIS. Fact: The image was taken way back in 2006 when people carried the coffins of 61 victims killed in a bomb attack at Kebitogollewa (Sri Lanka). Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image posted on Facebook is run through Google Reverse Image Search, the links to similar images can be found in the search results. As the image posted has \u2018Getty Images\u2019 written over it, the Getty Images link in the search results is opened. Then, it can be found that the photo was taken back in 2006. The picture has the following description, \u201cSri Lankan mourners carry the coffins for 61 victims killed in a bomb attack at Kebitogollewa in north-central Sri Lanka, 16 June 2006. A powerful land mine ripped through an overcrowded bus 15 June, killing 64 people including 15 children, and wounded 80 others in an attack blamed on Tamil Tiger rebels, who have denied involvement.\u201d So, the image is of the procession of 2006 blast victims, killed in the attack carried out by Tamil Tiger rebels.\n\nFinally, this Sri Lankan funeral procession photo, being shared as the funeral procession of the victims in the Sri Lankan bomb blasts (2019) is actually that of 2006 blast victims, killed in the attack carried out by Tamil Tiger rebels.", "lang": "en"}
