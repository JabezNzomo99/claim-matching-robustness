The claim is false; the photo has circulated in various media reports about a commander of an Iraqi militia group who decapitated ISIS members in the country.\n\nThe picture was posted here on Facebook on February 8, 2020. It has been shared 124 times.\n\nTranslated to English, the Indonesian-language caption reads: \u201cThe woman who is a follower of ISIS felt so proud after decapitating Muslims in the name of Allah. \n\n They really have mental illness.\n\n\u201cDo we have to accept the other 600 of them who have been exposed to villain terrorist virus like this?\u201d\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nFollowing a lengthy public debate, Indonesia said it would not bring home nearly 700 hundred of its citizens, including women and children, who joined the Islamic State in the Middle East over security fears, AFP reported here on December 12, 2020.\n\nThe same picture of the woman has been shared nearly 100 times after it appeared on Twitter here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the picture has circulated in various media reports about a commander of a militia group in Iraq who decapitated Islamic State members in the country.\n\n(Warning: graphic content) A Google reverse image followed by subsequent keyword search found the photo was originally posted here on Facebook by Wahida Mohamed on November 19, 2015. The photo was part of a series of pictures that show the same woman posing with dead bodies.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original photo on the Facebook page of Wahida Mohamed:\n\nThe photo also appeared in this October 4, 2016 report published by the US-based International Business Times. The article's headline reads: \u201cIraq: Woman decapitates Isis members, cooks their head as revenge for killing her kin\u201d.\n\nThe first four paragraphs of the report read: \u201cAn Iraqi woman is fast turning out to be an individual most dreaded by the Islamic State group \u2014 also known as Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (Isis) or Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) \u2014 because she is paying them back in their own coin in her quest to exact revenge on them.\n\n\u201cThe 39-year-old woman, named Wahida Mohamed Al Jumaily, has had several of her close relatives, including father, husband and three brothers, killed by Isis over the past couple of years. In fact, her husband was killed earlier this year, which seems to be trigger for her current action against Isis members.\n\n\u201cJumaily, who seems to be better known as Um Hanadi among those who have come in contact with her, has already been compared to \u2018Iraq's Rambo\u2019 Abu Azrael, because of the similarities in their efforts to push Isis out of Iraq and regain the country for its residents.\n\n\u201cJumaily leads a militia group of 70-odd people against Isis, and has reportedly not only decapitated members of the terrorist organisation but also cooked their heads, in a show of strength that is matched by what Isis itself does to many of its prisoners. She has even posted these photos on social media platforms.\u201d\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the photo in the International Business Times report:\n\nThe photo\u2019s caption reads: \u201cIraq: Woman decapitates Isis members, cooks their head as revenge for killing her kin. Wahida Mohamed Al Jumaily has received personal death threats from Isis chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\u201d\n\nThe photo is credited to \u201cUm Hanadi\u201d, which is Al Jumaily\u2019s alias.\n\nBelow is the screenshot comparison between the photo in the misleading post (L) and the photo in the International Business Times report (R):\n\nReports about Al Jumaily have been published by CNN on September 29, 2016 here and Al Jazeera on June 14, 2018 here.", "lang": "en"}
