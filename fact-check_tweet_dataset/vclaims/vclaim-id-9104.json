MPs suggested that delaying the decision costs the UK between \u00a32 million and \u00a37 million a day.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-9104", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/does-delaying-airport-expansion-cost-us-6-million-day/", "vclaim": "The idea behind this kind of assessment is to suggest how much all the future benefits from an investment project are worth at the time of the decision. Benefits that come further away in the future are treated as if they\u2019re worth less. The point is to decide, in financial terms, which project gives the most benefit for the smallest investment.\n\nThe report suggested that the future benefits over 60 years from a new runway at Gatwick were worth \u00a389 billion to us at present, an extended runway at Heathrow was worth more at \u00a3131 billion and a new northwest runway at Heathrow was worth the most, at \u00a3147 billion. This was one of the reasons why the report favoured a new runway at Heathrow.\n\nA peer review of the findings, also commissioned by the Airport Commission, emphasised the difficulties in predicting the impact of a new runway on the UK economy, and cautioned against attaching \u2018significant weight\u2019 to the report\u2019s final figures\n\nThe British Infrastructure Group, a cross-party group of MPs, has taken the Airport Commission\u2019s valuations and used them for a different purpose.\n\nThey\u2019ve divided each figure up to suggest a \u2018lost value for each day\u2019s delay\u2019 on a decision about which project to choose. So between \u00a32 million and \u00a34 million \u2018cost per day\u2019 for a new runway at Gatwick, \u00a35 million and \u00a36 million for a runway extension at Heathrow, and \u00a36 million and \u00a37 million for a new runway at Heathrow.\n\nThe figures suggested by the British Infrastructure Group aren\u2019t so much \u2018costs\u2019. This isn\u2019t money that has to be paid every day until a decision is made.\n\nThey\u2019re based on predictions which include all the opportunities the UK could miss out on in the future if it doesn\u2019t have a new runway, and judgments about what those missed opportunities will be worth.\n\nSo it\u2019s better to treat the estimates as judgements caveated with a reasonable degree of uncertainty, rather than facts.\n\nBy focusing only on the economic benefits, the British Infrastructure Group has also ignored the predicted costs of each airport expansion proposal.\n\nWhen these are factored in, the Airport Commission suggests that the overall social benefit balances out to between about \u00a35.5 billion and \u00a310.8 billion for a new runway at Gatwick, depending on how strictly carbon emissions are controlled. They suggest a net benefit of between \u00a31 billion and \u00a310.2 billion for an extended runway at Heathrow and between \u00a31.4 billion \u00a311.8 billion for a new runway at Heathrow. So it suggests the net benefits from expanding Heathrow would be more sensitive to how carbon emissions are controlled than expanding Gatwick.\n\nArguably, these bottom-line figures don\u2019t give the full picture either.\n\nFirst, looking at the net benefit to the economy overall won\u2019t tell you who wins and who loses. For example, the report suggests that passengers would enjoy cheaper travel and a better service if any of the projects went ahead, whilst aviation businesses would suffer lower profits. Particular places or industries would also do better or worse from each proposal.\n\nSecond, a range of opponents of the third runway at Heathrow have questioned whether certain negative consequences had been given enough consideration, such as environmental costs, noise pollution and public health concerns.\n\nArguably, the report is using the Airport Commission's original estimates in a way they aren\u2019t meant to be used anyway.\n\nThe Commission gave a figure for the present value of each investment. This is a way to compare options - to make a judgement about all the benefits that will stem from an investment and sum up what those future benefits are worth to us right now, at the time of the decision. The British Infrastructure Group have treated the same valuations as if they show the value added to the UK economy by each investment, which isn\u2019t the same thing.\n\nDividing up present value calculations may not give you a good idea of the costs that come from putting off an investment project. To start with, the value assigned to benefits in the far future are reduced down in present value calculations. If the British Infrastructure Group had used figures for the value added by each project as their starting point, they might actually have suggested a higher number.\n\nThis still might not have been a very good estimate for the cost of delay. Investment projects often have one-off benefits that won\u2019t be reduced by a year\u2019s delay, as the British Infrastructure Group acknowledges. Delaying building-work also delays the costs of future repair-work - a runway built one year later, for example, might be expected to last one year longer. The strategic benefits of increasing capacity ahead of the UK\u2019s rivals may matter more, but these considerations aren't included in the figures.\n\nBecause there are three possible projects, there are three starting points for suggesting how much a new runway is worth to us right now.\n\nThe Airport Commission has said that it also depends on whether the UK tries to meet its carbon emissions targets by strict \u2018carbon-capping\u2019 or more flexible \u2018carbon-trading\u2019 systems, which they think would restrict the growth of businesses less.\n\nThat means there are at least six alternative suggestions for how much the future benefits from a new runway are worth to us right now, looking forward over 60 years. These are considerably reduced if we factor in the costs as well.\n\nYou can\u2019t account for everything\n\nThe estimates don\u2019t account for every effect that comes from building a new runway. For example, the Airport Commission didn\u2019t factor in how construction work on the runways will affect GDP, because they think it\u2019s too hard to judge how much investment spending will be drawn away from other places in the economy, or exactly how the aviation industry will grow.\n\nThe British Infrastructure Group agreed that you could debate the costs of a delayed decision up or down, depending on which factors you considered.\n\nThe Airport Commission\u2019s peer reviewers concluded that although the report was useful for considering the strategic reasons behind airport expansion, it shouldn\u2019t be assumed that the final figures for the economic impact are reliable.\n\nNo decision has been made\n\nThe Airport Commission recommended the Heathrow Airport northwest runway proposal as the best option, although this wasn\u2019t an uncontroversial decision.\n\nThe government has said that the decision will now need to be reviewed in light of the EU referendum result and that they will continue looking at the different options.\n\nThis article was updated on 8 August 2015 to incorporate a dicussion about the Airport Commission's suggestions for the net present value of each project, and a note from the Commission's expert advisors on the findings.", "lang": "en"}
