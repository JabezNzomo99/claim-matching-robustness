This is what makes people come back for their coffee.A friend recently told me that a co-worker's boyfriend works for an independent research lab that randomly tests consumer products and they found nicotine has been added to the coffee sold at Tim Horton's (Canada's largest chain of coffee/donut shops).Are you a Non- Smoker or Against smoking all together ? Do you ever wonder why you have to have your coffee every morning? ** TIM HORTON'S SHOCKER ** A man from Arkansas came up to Canada for a visit only to find himself in the hospital after a couple of days. Doctor's told him that he had suffered of cardiac arrest. He was allergic to Nicotine. The man did not understand why that would of happened as he does not smoke knowing full well he was allergic to Nicotine. He told the doctor that he had not done anything different while he was on vacation other than having Tim Horton's coffee. The man then went back to Tim Horton's and asked what was in their coffee. Tim Horton's refuses to divulge that information. After threatening legal action, Tim Horton's finally admitted..... *** THERE IS NICOTINE IN TIM HORTON'S COFFEE *** A girl I know was on the patch to quit smoking. After a couple of days she was having chest pains & was rushed to the hospital. The doctor told her that she was on a Nicotine overload. She swore up & down that she had not been smoking. SHE WAS HAVING HER COFFEE EVERY MORNING. Now imagine a women who quits smoking because she finds out that she is pregnant, but still likes to have her Tim Horton's once in a while. THIS IS NOT A JOKE, PLEASE PASS THIS ALONG.... YOU MIGHT SEE THIS ON THE NEWS SOON.\n\nAlthough Canada has its share of Starbucks outlets, the local Tim Hortons is the destination of choice for the average Canadian in search of a quick pick-me-up. The coffee vended there is exceptional, but just as important, most of these shops are open 24 hours a day, making a stop at these donut emporiums a personal ritual that can fit into anyone\u2019s daily routine no matter what shift he might work. Tim Hortons is Canada\u2019s best-known coffee and fresh baked goods chain, established in 1964 and now boasting more than 3,400 stores across Canada and over 800 additional locations within the United States. The chain\u2019s reputation rests just as much upon its coffee as its baked goods, so coffee not sold within twenty minutes of its first being offered for sale is thrown out to ensure that patrons always get a fresh cup of java for their money. According to the President and C.O.O. of Tim Hortons, Paul House, the coffee\u2019s special appeal to consumers is the result of a superior blend and careful quality control:\n\nThe Tim Hortons special blend of coffee has been closely guarded from the beginnings of the chain, and is subject to stringent quality assurance measures by a team of coffee experts located at the Tim Hortons head office in Oakville, Ontario. \u201cWe do extensive testing and cupping of our coffee to ensure the highest quality standards are met, and now our people can extend that quality right into the roasting process here in Rochester,\u201d said [Paul] House. \u201cWe start with the best possible arabica beans from various countries of the world to create our special blend, and can follow those beans right through the roasting and packaging processes.\u201d\n\nBecause folks are willing to line up to purchase Tim Hortons coffee rather than secure their daily cup from another source, some people have begun looking for a more sinister explanation beyond the obvious one of \u201cThe coffee is really good, the donuts are fresh, and they\u2019re always open.\u201d The combination of reasonable prices, tasty product, and numerous convenient locations appears to have spawned a particular rumor that attempts to explain the popularity of Tim Hortons\u2019 coffee: according to the whispers, the beverage has been made so alluring through the addition of nicotine, MSG, or \u201cthe maximum amount of caffeine allowed by law.\u201d In one elaborate version of the rumor, a Tim Hortons patron suffers a puzzling and severe allergic reaction after drinking some of the chain\u2019s coffee; only under duress (and an insistence on absolute secrecy) does a Tim Hortons executive disclose to the treating doctor a list of the ingredients in their \u201cspecial blend\u201d \u2014 a list that reveals the presence of nicotine. Variants of the basic rumor assert it\u2019s not the coffee itself that\u2019s loaded with nicotine, but the chain\u2019s coffee filters or that nicotine has been sprayed on the inside of its disposable cups.\n\nBut Tim Hortons coffee does not include nicotine, MSG, an usually high level of caffeine, or any similar additives. Just as the USA has its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to oversee the safety of commercially-sold ingestibles, so Canada has its Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). Neither agency would permit the knowing inclusion of dangerous substances in a foodstuff vended to an unwary public.\n\nNicotine is one of the most powerful poisons known. Though we normally think in terms of arsenic and strychnine when the term \u2018poison\u2019 comes up, the truth is that nicotine is far more deadly. The lethal dose of arsenic for a 150 pound adult is 200 mg., for strychnine 75 mg., but for nicotine only 60 mg. Nicotine can and does kill even in relatively small amounts. Those who wear nicotine patches must exercise great care about the disposal of their used patches lest children or pets come in contact with the seemingly \u201cspent\u201d aids and become deeply sickened or even possibly die. Not surprisingly, nicotine is not permitted as a food additive in either Canada or the U.S.\n\nAs for MSG, although the FDA has designated the additive \u201cgenerally recognized as safe,\u201d many people claim to experience adverse effects (such as headaches) after ingesting it, so all consumables containing the substance have to be clearly labelled to indicate its presence.\n\nThe \u201cnicotine additive\u201d rumor does not adhere solely to Tim Hortons; it has been kited about other business concerns whose products have proved to be highly (and some would say inexplicably) popular:\n\nIn another form the rumor has been known to take, evil-intentioned companies or heartless universities are said to be slipping laxatives into their food to lessen the effects of food poisoning:\n\nWhile at lunch with some friends yesterday, i heard what to me, sounds like a classic urban legend. Apparently there is a tale making the rounds that claims all fast food restaurants inject laxatives into their food so that people will pass the food on quickly, thereby reducing the risk of patrons getting food poisoning. Some of my students have told me something that sounds like an urban legend. They say that the dining service here (Lafayette College) is \u201crequired\u201d to put a certain amount of laxatives in the food so that in case people get food poisoning the food will get out of people\u2019s systems.\n\nIn yet another form of the basic rumor, conscienceless fast food companies have been incorporating anti-emetics into their offerings to help patrons keep their food down:\n\nA blow to the heart of the rumor in all its manifestations is that extraneous chemicals could not be surreptitiously slipped into any company\u2019s ingestible products without leaving that concern open to a stream of customer lawsuits. In the case of nicotine, the number of wrongful death suits filed would be unimaginable, given that it wouldn\u2019t take much of that particular poison to kill someone. As for MSG, caffeine, laxatives, or anti-emetics, there is no substance so innocuous that it won\u2019t provoke allergic or violent physical reactions in some people. Whatever small advantage a company might gain by adding a little extra something that would addict clients to its offerings would be quickly offset by multi-million dollar losses in civil court and a loss of consumer confidence in the even higher court of public opinion. Folks ain\u2019t going to patronize a place known for killing or sickening its customers, no matter how good the coffee.\n\nThe Tim Hortons rumors reached such prominence that in February 2004 the CBC news program Disclosure conducted its own investigation, one which included having samples of coffee from Tim Hortons (and a couple of competing chains) sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results: Tim Hortons coffee contained no measurable amount of nicotine and had, on average, less caffeine than coffee from either Starbucks or Second Cup.\n\nTim Hortons\u2019 loyal customer base was built the old-fashioned way: good product served fresh in easily-accessible locations.", "lang": "en"}
