Kamala Harris, using the misogynistic slur \u201choe.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 17, 2020, a Facebook user posted a photograph of what appeared to be a billboard that read \u201cJoe and the Hoe: Sniff and Blow Tour 2020,\u201d above \u201cRob Roy Auto, Salisbury MA.\u201d In her accompanying post, the user included contact details for the car dealership, as well as the Salisbury town clerk, an effort to encourage others to make complaints about the sign:\n\nSimilar social media posts followed, with users typically condemning the sign and calling for a boycott of the business associated with it. Some also appeared to celebrate the billboard.\n\nThe sign was real, and the photographs of it were authentic and unedited.\n\nThe billboard was erected in August 2020 by Robert Roy, who owns the dealership in Salisbury, and has gained a degree of local notoriety due to his penchant for erecting signs outside of his business that reflect his own pro-Trump, anti\u2013Democrat views.\n\nIn an Instagram post on Aug. 24, Roy posed next to the offensive billboard, establishing its authenticity. Further verification was to be found in an Aug. 20 news segment on WYCN, which contained footage of the sign in question. Salisbury Town Manager Neil Harrington said he had received hundreds of complaints about the billboard, and WYCN reported that Roy had voluntarily taken it down.\n\n\u201cJoe and the Hoe\u201d has emerged as an offensive epithet for the 2020 Democratic presidential ticket of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and Harris. The California senator has already made history as the first Black woman on the presidential ticket of a major political party. If elected in November, she would break new ground again as the country\u2019s first female vice president.\n\nEarlier in August, the National Basketball Association (NBA) cut ties with photographer Bill Baptist after he posted a \u201cJoe and the Hoe\u201d meme to Facebook, and T-shirts bearing the offensive phrase were sold through Amazon until a backlash prompted the company to withdraw them.\n\nThe phrase \u201csniff and blow\u201d can be found in certain right-wing corners of the internet. The word \u201csniff\u201d appears to refer to past allegations of inappropriate touching by Biden (in May 2019, former Nevada State Assembly member Lucy Flores claimed that the then-vice president had kissed her on the head and smelled her hair during an event five years earlier).\n\nThe word \u201cblow\u201d appears to be a crude and deeply misogynistic allusion to a long-standing allegation among Harris\u2019 critics that she owes her early rise in California politics to her past relationship with former San Francisco Mayor and State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. In August 2020, the right-leaning American Spectator published an opinion article in which Rabbi and Attorney Dov Fischer smeared Harris as a \u201cmattress\u201d and \u201cescort.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to WYCN, Roy endeavored to explain away the misogynistic references to Harris in his billboard, claiming, \u201cI think she\u2019s a tool for the left, that\u2019s the whole meaning behind the sign.\u201d He added without explanation that the references were \u201csupposed to be satire.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
