But the claim is false; officials have dismissed the claim, and the author of the viral publication admitted it was incorrect.\n\nThe web publication was relayed in multiple Facebook posts, including this one which has been shared more than 800 times since it was published on March 23, 2020.\n\nOn March 23, 2020, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari advised residents of the capital Abuja and the commercial hub Lagos -- the city hit hardest by the outbreak -- to stay at home and avoid public gatherings as part of measures deployed to contain the pandemic.\n\nThe web publication originated from a now-deleted post published on a website called Mcebiscoo.com. The site prompts readers to provide sensitive information such as voter or national identity card numbers, promising to give them access to the government\u2019s purported largesse.\n\n\u201cIf you have your voters or National ID card, Follow the link below Put in ur NIN or voters card Serial No (sic),\u201d the post reads in part.\n\nThe NIN, or National Identification Number, is a unique 11-digit number issued to all Nigerian citizens and legal residents.\n\nUsing the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP tracked down multiple versions of this story, including here, here, and here. Some of them referenced \u201cMcebiscoo\u201d.\n\nLinks to these publications were widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. We\u2019ve archived some of the posts here, here, here, here and here.\n\nA similar message also circulated in WhatsApp groups in Nigeria.\n\nThe posts about purported cash handouts in Nigeria came as the United States started to work on an emergency stimulus package - including payments to all taxpayers - to contain the growing economic damage from the coronavirus, as reported by AFP.\n\nThe Nigerian information ministry has refuted the claim. \u201cPlease disregard the story, it\u2019s fake,\u201d the ministry told AFP in a response sent via a Twitter message.\n\nIn addition, Nigeria\u2019s information and culture minister Lai Muhammed described the claim as \u201cfake\u201d and the \u201cwork of scammers who are trying to cash in on a global tragedy\u201d during a press conference on March 23, 2020.\n\nWhen contacted by AFP, Mc Ebisco, who publishes the site Mcebiscoo.com, said he deleted the web post after he realised it was false.\n\n\u201cI have taken it down,\u201d he told AFP in a phone interview on March 26, 2020. \u201cI saw it on WhatsApp and then I posted it, but later I realised it wasn\u2019t real.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
