The post also makes a discredited claim that UK Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock owns shares in a vaccine company (here).\n\nBabylon provides remote consultations with doctors and health professionals using digital technology in Europe, North America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In the UK it does some work with the NHS (here). The post incorrectly claims the company wants to \u201cchip babies\u201d and supports \u201cchipped vaccines\u201d. This claim appears to be prompted by a blog on the Babylon website headlined \u201cIs the future of vaccines needle-free and digital?\u201d (here). A screenshot of this headline is included in the Facebook post.\n\nThe Babylon blog was written by Dr Claudia Pastides and is described by a Babylon spokesperson as \u201ca thought-leadership piece from one of our GPs and has no relevance to Babylon\u201d. The blog post does not advocate for chipped vaccines or for \u201cchipping babies\u201d. It outlines the potential for digitization of immunisation records through an online Red Book. The Red Book, or Personal Child Health Record, is given to the guardian of any child in the NHS system. The e-Redbook is a digital version of this record that is being trialled in some areas of the UK in 2020 (here).\n\nThe Babylon blog post also outlines the potential for needle-free vaccines. It is made clear in the post that the needle-free alternative would be in the form of a plaster. A spokesperson for Babylon told Reuters that it is not involved in the development or production of any vaccines, and \u201chas no future plans to\u201d. The spokesperson also advised those looking for information about vaccinations to contact the NHS.\n\nThe post correctly links Babylon to Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Two screenshots show sections of a publicly available press release (here) from Babylon dated August 2, 2019. It includes a line about Babylon\u2019s partnership with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rwandan Government in launching a mobile phone app. The partnership was announced in November 2017 (here) and did not include any work around vaccinations.\n\nThe Facebook post also claims that Health Secretary Matt Hancock purchased 75 percent shares in Porton Biopharma, a vaccine and pharmaceutical company. This is false. Porton Biopharma is wholly owned by the state (here). Matt Hancock was accused of breaking the ministerial code in 2018 after endorsing Babylon\u2019s GP at Hand app in an article in an Evening Standard supplement that had financial support from the firm (here).\n\nFalse. Babylon does not advocate for implanting chips in babies and has no involvement in the development or production of vaccines. Health Secretary Matt Hancock does not own shares in a vaccine company.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
