Lavrov Says Plea Squeezed Out of Confessed Russian Agent", "subtitle": "While a debate rages within the U.S. regarding the country\u2019s plea bargaining system and the use of solitary confinement, there is no evidence that Maria Butina was faced with circumstances that deviate from current norms in the U.S. criminal justice system.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "December 17, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-11819", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/butina-torture-plea-system/29661112.html", "vclaim": "On Thursday, December 13, 2018, Maria Butina, a Russian gun rights activist, appeared before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where she pleaded guilty to conspiring \u201cto act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government, specifically the Russian Federation, without prior notification to the Attorney General.\u201d\n\nAs part of the plea deal, Butina, who now faces a maximum of five years in prison and the prospect of deportation, waived her right of appeal.\n\nButina has further agreed to cooperate with U.S. authorities in an ongoing investigation.\n\nIn July, Butina was arrested and charged with conspiracy and working as an undeclared foreign agent of the Russian government. Prosecutors alleged she sought to cultivate ties with U.S. political groups and individuals \u2013 primarily conservatives \u2013 on behalf of Alexander Torshin, who resigned as deputy governor of Russia\u2019s Central Bank in November. Torshin, a former Russian senator, has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe former member of the Russian Council of Federation, Torshin was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in April along with other Russian businessmen and politicians for \u201cadvancing Russia\u2019s malign activities.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Butina pleaded guilty so that she could be \u201creleased as soon as possible and return to [her] homeland.\u201d\n\n\"I understand this woman: she is staying in the most difficult conditions and faced specific kind[s] of tortures for months: they either forcibly wake her up and let her walk in the night or place her in a solitary confinement cell, and so on. I have reasons to assume that the goal of the [detention] conditions that were created for her was to break her will and make her admit to something that she most probably did not commit,\" Lavrov said.\n\nIn the U.S. 97% of Cases Resolved by Plea\n\nRegarding the plea bargaining system, Catherine Gallagher, an associate professor at George Mason University\u2019s Criminology, Law and Society unit, told Polygraph.info that in the U.S., majority of cases \u201cend up in a plea,\u201d and very few people are actually tried in a court of law.\n\n\u201cMaybe three percent of all cases actually go to trial. It was very unusual that [former Trump campaign chair Paul] Manafort, for example, went to trial. Most cases end up in a plea.\u201d\n\nHer view lines up with an 84-page report released in July by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) on bargaining over criminal charges and defendants\u2019 pleas.\n\nIn it, the NACDL found that \u201cafter a 50 year decline, fewer than 3% of federal criminal cases result in a trial.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cWith more than 97% of criminal cases being resolved by plea in a constitutional system predicated upon the Sixth Amendment right to a trial, the fact of imbalance and injustice in the system is self-evident.\u201d\n\nThe report said that in most primary offense categories, \u201cthe average post-trial sentence was more than triple the average post-plea sentence.\u201d\n\nIn Butina\u2019s case, she originally faced up to 15 years in prison, but pleaded to a maximum of five years.\n\nThe Marshall Project, a nonprofit online journalism organization focusing on issues related to criminal justice in the U.S., similarly found that 97 percent of federal convictions and 94 percent of state convictions are the results of guilty pleas.\n\nWriting for the Atlantic in 2017, Emily Yoffe came to the following conclusion in a report from Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\u201cAccording to District Attorney Glenn Funk, Nashville\u2013Davidson County handles about 100,000 criminal cases a year, 70 percent of which are misdemeanors, 30 percent felonies. Last year, attorneys in the public defender\u2019s office dealt with 20,000 misdemeanors and 4,900 felony cases. Of all the defendants processed in Nashville\u2013Davidson County last year, only 86 had their cases resolved at trial,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBased on such statistics, U.S. District Judge John Kane argues, \u201cthe so-called trial court is not primarily a trial court at all. It is a plea bargaining court.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Gallagher does not believe there was anything particularly unusual about Butina accepting a plea deal.\n\n\u201cIf her lawyers had thought there was a chance of going to trial and prevailing, then that\u2019s what they would have done. Her lawyers were required to offer her the plea option,\u201d she told Polygraph.info.\n\nGallagher said there is an incentive for every pre-trial detainee to take a plea.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a phrase called: the process is the punishment. You serve your whole punishment before you even get your sentence,\u201d Gallagher said.\n\nAs for the disinformation value of Lavrov\u2019s statements, Gallagher said that claiming Butina was unduly pressured to plea is \u201cvery hard to argue in the U.S. because it\u2019s the norm.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf America is the audience [for Lavrov\u2019s statements] they are not going to win this propaganda war. But in Russia it\u2019s easy,\u201d Gallagher said.\n\nRegarding allegations of torture, Polygraph.info previously found there is a basis for saying extended time in solitary does constitute mistreatment or torture.\n\nIn 2013, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Juan M\u00e9ndez, urged that solitary confinement, if imposed at all, is only used \u201cin exceptional circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Mendez said solitary confinement should be banned as \u201ca punishment or extortion technique.\u201d But that conclusion is not universal, as some scholarly studies have concluded otherwise.\n\nGallagher said that while she personally considers solitary confinement to be \u201ca form of torture,\u201d that view is currently not shared by the United States Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIsolation is brutalizing -- not because you\u2019re being abused, but because it\u2019s very tough. It breaks a person in different ways. Some people are more resilient than others. No one comes out better than they come in,\u201d Gallagher said.\n\n\u201cDid it in fact expedite her willingness to plea? One can absolutely hypothesize yes, \u201d Gallagher added.\n\nBut she said that ultimately, \u201cwhether or not Butina was in isolation, based on the evidence, it\u2019s very likely her lawyers would have pushed her to take the plea.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, there is no evidence that Butina faced conditions that are peculiar to the U.S. criminal justice system. The argument over reforming that system is a separate issue. In earlier media reports, the U.S. Justice Department did not respond to questions regarding Butina\u2019s isolation.\n\nDuring the hearing for the change of plea Butina and her lawyers denied any physical or psychological pressure telling the judge the decision to enter the plea deal was voluntary.\n\nButina\u2019s attorney Robert Driscoll told the court his client is allowed a \u201ctime out of her cell, daily activities and visitations, including those from the representatives of the Russian foreign ministry,\u201d and that she is \u201cdoing well and competent.\u201d\n\nAs for Lavrov\u2019s claim that Butina confessed to the crime she did not commit, Butina\u2019s own words contradict this statement.\n\nWhen asked by the judge, \u201cAre you pleading guilty not for any other reason but because you are guilty?\u201d Butina answered, \u201cYes, guilty.\u201d\n\nThus, Lavrov\u2019s claim that Butina was pressured to confess to a crime she did not commit is misleading at best.", "lang": "en"}
