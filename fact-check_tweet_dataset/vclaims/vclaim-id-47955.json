The resolution proposing this plan recommended setting pensions at 63% of pre-retirement earnings (the average in countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).\n\nThey did not, as the Facebook post claimed, vote to increase pensions to match the EU average.\n\nWhat happened at the SNP conference?\n\nAt the SNP conference this year one of the resolutions brought to be voted on by party members was to: \u201csupport the commissioning of a Scottish State Pension Plan, and let\u2019s target the OECD average of 63% as the minimum for a Scottish state pension and deliver financial security and wellbeing to the pensioners of an independent Scotland.\u201d\n\nDuring the speech introducing the resolution, more detail was given on the reasoning behind it: \u201cThe UK state pension is ranked the lowest in the developed world, this is according to the 2017 OECD report looking into pensions.\n\n\u201cThe study calculated that the typical British worker would, at retirement, receive a state pension and other benefits worth around 29% of what they had previously earned\u2026\n\n\u201cYou could have doubled the UK state pension and still not have met the OECD average of 63%\u201d.\n\nSo rather than voting to increase the state pension in an independent Scotland, the conference voted to support the commissioning of a plan looking into this.\n\nWhat did the OECD say?\n\nIt is correct that a 2017 OECD report found that \u201cfull-career average earners\u201d in the UK could expect 29% replacement from \u201cmandatory parts of the pension system\u201d. That was compared to an OECD average of 63% and was the lowest of any of the 35 OECD countries in the study.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before when fact checking claims about pensions, differences in pension systems between countries mean it\u2019s not always fair to compare them in this way.\n\nHere the OECD looked at pension schemes for private sector workers only. The data covers compulsory pension schemes whether they were public or private pensions, and schemes which covered at least 85% of pensioners, like those found in Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\nThe OECD also looked at the level of wage replacement for these pensioners once voluntary pensions were taken into account. By this measure the UK ranked 22 of the 35 OECD countries with a rate of 62%\u2014still below the OECD average of 69% but far from the lowest (Mexico at around 30%) and similar to countries including New Zealand, Japan and the Czech Republic.\n\nThese figures don\u2019t tell us anything about the actual amount pensioners in each country would receive in relation to each other, just how that compares as a percentage of their former earnings.\n\nWe\u2019re looking into what a pension set at this 63% level would mean for pensioners in Scotland, and will publish more at a later date.", "lang": "en"}
