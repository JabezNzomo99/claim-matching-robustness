Nobody knew the man\u2019s name, but friends referred to him as Jessie, so investigators decided to try DNA testing with hopes that something would pop up in the nationwide DNA database. What popped up on the computer screen in the high-tech lab stunned everyone. The DNA results of \u2018Jessie Doe\u2019 were an exact match to the one and only, Elvis Aaron Presley. Lab technician Robert Brensdale said he and his lab assistant, Madeline Hedgespeth, laughed when the name popped up. \u201cWe thought somebody, somewhere, somehow in the system pulled the greatest and most elaborate prank on us ever, we both laughed with hysteria for about an hour,\u201d Brensdale told Jerry Hardin of the Hollywood Word, a new entertainment publication based out of Los Angeles.\n\nSoon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, the report was just a spoof of the ubiquitous \u201cElvis is alive\u201d and \u201cElvis faked his death\u201d rumors that have circulated ever since the singer passed away in August 1977, accompanied by an artificial rendering of what an elderly Elvis might look like.\n\nThe spoof was published by the Empire News, a site that issues nothing but fictional stories with titles such as \u201cCure for Cancer Discovered; \u2018Amazingly Simple\u2019 Says Researcher,\u201d and \u201cCollege Student Excused from Classes After Dog Eats Grandmother,\u201d and \u201cWoman Gives Birth, Confuses Doctors by Asking for Maternity Test.\u201d\n\nThe site\u2019s disclaimer notes that \u201cEmpire News is intended for entertainment purposes only.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
