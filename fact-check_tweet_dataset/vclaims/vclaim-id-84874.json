But his tweet lit up the Twitterverse, so now we are going to fact check whether the memo suggests what Trump claims \u2014 that the Obama administration \u201cactively supported\u201d al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nThere was little profound in this analysis. Moreover, the idea that Western support for opposition to the Syrian regime translated into Obama administration support for AQI is rather loopy, especially if you know anything about the policy debates in the administration at the time.\n\nAt the time, the State Department noted that Jabhat al-Nusra had claimed 600 attacks in Syria. \u201cThrough these attacks, al-Nusrah has sought to portray itself as part of the legitimate Syrian opposition while it is, in fact, an attempt by AQI to hijack the struggles of the Syrian people for its own malign purposes,\u201d the State Department said in announcing the designation.\n\nThe DIA memo \u201cshows there are some elements of the Syrian opposition that were vulnerable to extremists, and that is one of the main reasons the USG has been so careful about who we are supporting with what kind of assistance,\u201d said Derek Chollet, who in 2012 managed policy concerning the Syrian conflict as the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. \u201cIt is why we were so concerned about others who were less judicious about that support \u2014 the Turks and Persian Gulf partners \u2014 and pressed them to support only the moderate opposition.\u201d\n\nChollet noted that although the memo is dated August 2012, it was not until a year later that the United States provided any military support to the opposition. He said this decision was made \u201conly after policymakers were satisfied that the vetting requirements were strong enough that we could be confident where the assistance was going and how it would be used \u2014 for the very purpose of fighting terrorists.\u201d Chollet added that one major criticism by Republicans at the time was that the vetting requirements for the administration train/equip program were too strict.\n\nJames Jeffrey, who was the U.S. ambassador to Iraq in 2012, said the reporting in the memo \u201clooks like routine headquarters analysis\u201d that actually turned out to be wrong. While the memo said that AQI wanted to organize and exploit the Syrian resistance, it failed to do so; Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamic State, or ISIS, are only a fraction of the resistance, he said. \u201cThe administration\u2019s covert support program was minimalist as it only supported groups and people who clearly were not part of ISIS or AQI,\u201d Jeffrey added.\n\nRobert Ford, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria, told our colleagues Karen DeYoung and Jose A. DeReal that the document has been \u201ccirculating on the Internet for years.\u201d He said he was \u201c90 percent sure\u201d that the cable was a report by a U.S. military official in Baghdad of a briefing by the Iraqi military. \u201cTo be really cynical,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s the Iraqis giving the Iranian line.\u201d\n\nThe Post article, in far greater detail than the DIA memo, reported on the rise of Jabhat al-Nusra: \u201cIts growing role has prompted concerns that the 17-month-old uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime is becoming radicalized as the bloodshed soars.\u201d The article noted that al-Nusra\u2019s growing visibility \u201chighlights one of the reasons the United States and its allies have been reluctant to arm Syrian rebels.\u201d\n\n\u201cReports addressed in this manner reflect an institutional address for the State Department writ large. All reports that come to Washington have that address,\u201d said State Department spokesman John Kirby. \u201cTo be clear \u2014 a report addressed in this way does not indicate it was sent to the secretary of state or the secretary\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nThis is what happens when people with little understanding of policy or context choose to willfully misinterpret documents. This is a relatively unimportant memo, with little information not in newspapers at the time. Rather than showing that the Obama administration is supporting terrorist groups, the information in the memo demonstrates why the administration was so reluctant to back rebel groups in Syria, often to the annoyance of Republican hawks.", "lang": "en"}
