He and the party reviewed the monthly bills. Rubio would identify personal expenses and pay those charges directly to American Express, he said. Rubio was running for U.S. Senate at the time of the report. He accused his opponent, then-Florida governor Charlie Crist, of leaking his corporate card statements to the media out of desperation.\n\nYet a September 2010 independent audit of the party\u2019s credit card usage found that there was, indeed, a policy in its \u2014 surprise! \u2014 policy manual. Corporate cards were \u201cfor RPOF business use only,\u201d the manual said, and some cardholders also were told verbally that they could only use the card for party-related business. But auditors also found poor internal controls for handling expenses, and that spending ultimately was done at the approval of then-party chairman, Jim Greer. (Greer was forced to resign as chairman over the controversy and later was sentenced to 18 months in prison for stealing $125,000 from the party.)\n\nThe Herald and Times questioned some of his business charges, such as repairs to his family minivan that was damaged by parking attendants at a political function. (The party agreed to cover half of his insurance deductible, according to the Herald and Times report.) The meals he charged to the party card especially came under scrutiny, as Rubio received a $126 per diem given to state legislators to help cover food and lodging.\n\nOther questionable charges ranged from $25.76 at Everglades Lumber for \u201csupplies,\u201d and $765 at Apple\u2019s online store for \u201ccomputer supplies.\u201d At the time of the report, Rubio\u2019s campaign did not provide an explanation for these charges. The next day, however, the campaign explained the charges questioned by the news outlets were incurred for business purposes. For example, the $25.76 charge was for office supplies, and the Apple store charge was for a computer hard drive and software to store political files.\n\nRubio has admitted to accidentally charging personal expenses that should have been made to his personal card. In one instance, he wrote, he pulled the wrong card from his wallet to pay for pavers. In another, his travel agent mistakenly used the party card to pay for a November 2006 family reunion in Georgia. Rubio wrote that each time, he identified the charges when they showed up in the bills and paid them to American Express, not to the Republican Party.\n\nHe says it wasn\u2019t a credit card, but a charge card. In fact, a charge card is a type of a credit card, but he\u2019s on point drawing a technical difference between the two. Rubio has used the term \u201ccredit card\u201d in his 2012 memoir in reference to his corporate card charges, and it is interesting that he has begun making this distinction in interviews. (His aide told the New York Times that Rubio had adopted a colloquial term for the card for his book.)\n\nRubio also says the Republican Party \u201cnever paid a single personal expense of mine \u2014 personal expense.\u201d Notice the emphasis here. There was an instance when Rubio did repay the party for an expense that should not have been charged to the party; he double-billed the party and the state for airline tickets for state business. So, that is one example where he repaid the party rather than paying American Express directly, as he often notes. But technically, it was not for a personal purpose.\n\nWe don\u2019t make a judgment call on whether Rubio should have made personal charges, or whether some of the charges the party paid for should have been considered as \u201cparty business.\u201d But what readers should remember is that Rubio\u2019s total charges \u2014 about $160,000 total on the corporate card \u2014 were relatively small compared to other state party officials who ran up $500,000, even $1.3 million, on their party cards. And although other presidential hopefuls, and even media outlets, keep pointing to the February 2010 news coverage that revealed Rubio\u2019s personal charges, subsequent reports by the independent auditor and Florida Ethics Commission are worth reading, because they tell a fuller picture of how the saga unfolded.\n\n[Update: On Nov. 7, 2015, Rubio\u2019s campaign released the 2005 and 2006 statements, which we are examining in detail. According to the campaign, Rubio made eight personal charges that totaled $7,243.74 during that time. These charges were related to four events: a hotel and rental car charge for $1,745 in Las Vegas, where he extended his business trip to visit relatives; the $3,756.24 tile pavers charge he wrote about in his 2012 memoir; $599.45 at Braman Honda auto dealership and repair; and a $180 charge at a children\u2019s sports activity center. Rubio paid all of the charges directly to American Express, not to the party, the campaign said.", "lang": "en"}
