The image has been doctored from a local news outlet\u2019s photo of a Hong Kong student holding a pro-democracy flag.\n\nThe image was published here on Facebook to a public group with more than 22,000 followers.\n\nThe post has been shared 30 times.\n\nIt was published on October 25, 2019, as Hong Kong approached its fifth consecutive month of pro-democracy protests. Here is an AFP report about the protests.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nSeveral schoolgirls appear to be running uphill in the image. The student on the left can be seen holding a flag with words in both traditional Chinese and English, which translate as: \u201cHIV test / Free Free Free / First come, first served\".\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201cThe angels are walking so fast, there must be something weird?\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cangel\u201d refers to Executive Councillor Fanny Law's comments about female activists, or \"angels\", offering free sex to male frontline protesters. Here is a report on her remarks published by Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK on September 9, 2019.\n\nThe same photo was also published on a separate Facebook group here with an identical caption.\n\nThe image has been doctored; the original photo shows a pro-democracy slogan on the flag.\n\nA keyword search found the same photo in this post published on a Hong Kong-based Facebook page. The watermark of Hong Kong online news outlet Stand News can be seen on the bottom left-hand corner of the photograph.\n\nAFP subsequently found the original photo published here on the verified Facebook page for Stand News on October 25, 2019, with credit to photographer Nasha Chan.\n\nThe flag, which shows a different message that is also written in traditional Chinese and English, states: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong / FREE HONG KONG, REVOLUTION NOW / Revolution of our times\u201d.\n\n\u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d is a slogan coined by jailed pro-democracy activist Edward Leung as part of his campaign for Legislative Council by-elections in 2016. It was then adopted by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, according to this report published by local newspaper South China Morning Post on August 6, 2019.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the doctored image in the misleading posts (L) and the Stand News photo (R):\n\nThe Stand News post\u2019s traditional Chinese caption translates to English in part as: \u201c[Students form human chain to express demands at secondary school swimming gala]\n\n\u201cToday during the inter-school swimming gala, students from 20 secondary schools formed a human chain at the venue, Kowloon Park Swimming Pool, in a bid to protest the Hong Kong Schools Sports Federation's decision to ban student photographers and journalists from taking photos and conducting interviews in the pool area, as well as obstructing students' expression of political demands.\n\n\u201cSome students wore masks during the event and displayed flags wth the slogan 'Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u2019 in an attempt to express their demands.\"\n\nThe photo was taken here next to Kowloon Park Swimming Pool in the Tsim Sha Tsui district.\n\nThe location on Google Street View is embedded below:\n\nThe same protest was reported by Hong Kong local news site hk01 here and local broadcaster Now News here.", "lang": "en"}
