But should they use hand sanitizer?\n\nOne popular image on Facebook says no.\n\n\"Hand sanitizer is anti-bacterial. The coronavirus is a virus,\" reads the post, which is a screenshot of a March 1 tweet. \"A bacteria and a virus is not (sic) the same. Wash your hands. Sanitizer will do nothing for the coronavirus.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post is wrong \u2014 health officials recommend the use of hand sanitizer to kill the coronavirus, known officially as COVID-19. The original Twitter user clarified that in a follow-up tweet, but the context was lost on Facebook.\n\nOn its list of ways to prevent coronavirus infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says to \"wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\" If soap and water are not accessible, the CDC recommends using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\n\nAlthough hand sanitizers are not effective against all viruses, the ones with high alcohol content have proven effective against some. Several studies indicate that alcohol-based sanitizers are effective against \"enveloped viruses,\" which include human coronaviruses.\n\nSince its outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December, the 2019 coronavirus has infected more than 88,000 people in 64 countries. In the United States, there have been 43 confirmed cases and six deaths, as of March 2, not including those repatriated to the country.\n\nSo continue washing your hands, and using hand sanitizer with a high alcohol content when you aren\u2019t near soap and water. The post telling you hand sanitizer will \"do nothing\" to stop the coronavirus is wrong. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
