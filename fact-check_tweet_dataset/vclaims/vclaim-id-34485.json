While the video hasn\u2019t been doctored in any manner, it has been edited to put the president\u2019s statement out of context.\n\nFirstly, it is not a recent statement. It was made on 31 January 2019. Secondly, the video clip is from President Kovind\u2019s address to both the Houses of the Parliament ahead of the last session of the 16th Lok Sabha which commenced on 31 January. Enlisting the work done by the Modi government in its first tenure, Kovind had said that the government made a provision for capital punishment in case of rape of minors.\n\nKovind can be heard making the same statement at around 17 minutes in the video.", "lang": "en"}
