Who knows?\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know what prompted the president\u2019s reluctance to get a flu shot or why he questioned whether it\u2019s a good idea, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says each year it saves thousands of lives and prevents tens of thousands of hospitalizations.\n\nThe president\u2019s hesitance about the need for a flu shot comes as medical professionals say those influenza vaccinations will be particularly important this year to lessen public confusion between seasonal flu and COVID-19, and to prevent unnecessary medical evaluations for the new coronavirus.\n\nTrump\u2019s comment about flu shots came during an interview with the Washington Examiner on May 14.\n\nTrump, May 14: I never lost anybody to the flu. Look, I\u2019ve had people having the flu. I said, \u201cHey, how are you doing with the flu?\u201d They had the flu. I never had the flu. You know, the first thing they did, they want to give me a flu shot. I never had the flu. And I come to the White House, \u201cSir, we have to give you a flu shot.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d And I took it. I don\u2019t know if I should have. Who knows? Three times now. I\u2019ve taken three flu shots, but anyway. \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the president has expressed reticence about getting a flu shot.\n\n\u201cAll my life I see \u2014 I was lucky; I never had the flu,\u201d Trump said during a Fox News virtual town hall on May 3. \u201cThen I came here; they want to give a flu shot. And I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want a flu shot,\u2019 but they have to give it.\u201d\n\nThe CDC says flu shots carry very little risk and have important benefits. According to the CDC, the vaccine \u201ccan reduce flu illnesses, doctors\u2019 visits, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations.\u201d The CDC points to studies that indicate \u201cflu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu vaccine.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump said he has never known anyone who has died from the flu, seasonal influenza kills thousands of Americans each year, and infects millions.\n\nFor the 2019-2020 flu season, which ended in April, 39 million to 56 million people had flu illnesses in the U.S., according to preliminary estimates from the CDC. The CDC estimates last season\u2019s flu had caused between 24,000 and 62,000 deaths. Since 2010, influenza in the U.S. has caused between 9 million and 45 million illnesses annually, the CDC says, with 12,000 to 61,000 of those resulting in death.\n\nAccording to the CDC, flu vaccinations \u2014 which target the three or four influenza viruses that researchers expect will be most common that season \u2014 prevent tens of thousands of hospitalizations each year. About 49% of Americans got a flu shot during the 2018-2019 flu season, and according to the CDC, that prevented: \u201c4.4 million flu illnesses, more than the population of Los Angeles; 58,000 flu hospitalizations, about the number of students at Ohio State University; 3,500 flu deaths, equivalent to saving about 10 lives per day over the course of a year.\u201d\n\nRisks from getting a flu shot are low, the CDC says. \u201cCommon side effects from a flu shot include soreness, redness, and/or swelling where the shot was given, headache (low grade), fever, nausea, muscle aches, and fatigue,\u201d according to a CDC webpage about seasonal flu shots.\n\n\u201cLife-threatening allergic reactions to influenza shots are very rare\u201d the CDC says. \u201cThere is a small possibility that influenza vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, generally no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated. This is much lower than the risk of severe complications from influenza, which can be prevented by influenza vaccine.\u201d\n\nA webpage produced by the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle seeks to debunk \u201c10 flu shot myths,\u201d including misconceptions such as that the flu shot can cause the flu, that flu shots don\u2019t work or contain harmful ingredients, and that flu shot side effects are worse than the flu itself. The final entry speaks directly to Trump\u2019s comments.\n\nHealth experts say flu shots are particularly important this year to \u201cprevent influenza and possible unnecessary evaluation for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nCDC Director Robert Redfield made this point when he clarified comments he made to the Washington Post on April 21. Redfield told the Post: \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through. \u2026 We\u2019re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt a press conference the following day, Redfield said he did not mean that the COVID-19 pandemic was going to be worse next winter, but rather that it would be \u201cmore difficult and potentially complicated because we\u2019ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence,\u201d Redfield said. \u201cOne of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall-winter season that we\u2019re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact of flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
