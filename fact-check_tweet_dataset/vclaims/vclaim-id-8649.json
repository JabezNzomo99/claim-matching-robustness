Risa Hontiveros dared President Rodrigo Duterte to send all members of the Liberal Party (LP) to prison is again making the rounds on social media.\n\nThe Nov. 5, 2017 report, published by website bayangpilipinas.com, bore the headline, \u201cHontiveros may Hamon kay Duterte: Ipakulong Mo Na Kami Lahat, Kung Kaya Mo!\u201d (Hontiveros dares Duterte: \u201cPut us all in prison, if you can!\u201d).\n\nIt claimed that the senator told Duterte, \u201cKung may bayag siya, kung gusto niya ipakulong na niya kami lahat para matapos na ang kanyang paghihirap (If he has balls, why doesn\u2019t he just send us all to prison to end his sufferings),\u201d and linked a Youtube video that has already been taken down.\n\nIt also claimed that Hontiveros had said the president is \u201cfond of scaring people without evidence.\"\n\nHontiveros supposedly made these statements following a controversy that linked her party-mates former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas and Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon to the illegal drug trade.\n\nWebsites newslogph.com and favradio.fm also posted the same report, word-per-word.\n\nNo legitimate news organization reported that the senator ever made such claims.\n\nThe false story was reshared three days after Hontiveros, in a Sept. 20 speech, called Duterte a \u201cdestabilizer-in-chief,\u201d in response to the latter\u2019s accusation that the opposition was plotting to destabilize him. She said:\n\n\u201cKaya\u2019t hinahamon natin si presidente, tigilin niya na ang kaniyang kahibangan na destabilisasyon (We\u2019re challenging the president to stop his delusions on destabilization).\u201d\n\nThe report was first uploaded late last year, a few weeks after self-proclaimed drug ring bagman Ricky Serenio, in an affidavit, linked Drilon and Roxas to slain drug lord Melvin Odicta Sr. The LP strongly denied the allegation.\n\nBayangpilipinas.com\u2019s post could have reached at least 1.48 million people. Among the Facebook pages that reshared the post, top generators include OFWDU30 Global Movement Association and Cooperation International and Bayang Pilipinas.\n\nFacebook pages President Rody Duterte Facebook Army and (vf)DDS/ DIEHARD DUTERTE SUPPORTERS were among the top generators when the report was first uploaded.", "lang": "en"}
