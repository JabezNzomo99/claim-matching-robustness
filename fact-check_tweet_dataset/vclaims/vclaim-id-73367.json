However, the claim is false; the image\u2019s creator told AFP Fact Check he produced the digital artwork using stock pictures.\n\nThe post, shared with more than 11,000 followers on August 30, 2020, has received more than 800 likes since then. It shows dark storm clouds hovering over a coastal city and a lightning bolt in the background.\n\n\u201cHUGE thunderstorm in South Carolina,\u201d part of the caption reads.\n\nThe post correctly credits the image to an account called \u201c@shavnore\u201d and describes the location as \u201cMyrtle Beach, South Carolina\u201d.\n\nHowever, as comments below the post point out, the image is not real but an altered artwork.\n\nA look at the Instagram account, which belongs to audio-visual specialist Brent Shavnore, shows the same composite image and hundreds of others.\n\nWhen contacted by AFP Fact Check, Shavnore confirmed it was his work.\n\n\u201cThis is a digital artwork created by me using stock photography and digital painting techniques,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nShavnore shared a YouTube tutorial video from his channel to illustrate how he creates the images.\n\nA basic internet search of \u201cMyrtle Beach stock images\u201d led to the original photograph on iStock by Getty Images, part of a series by Kruck that was used by Shavnore to make his digitally altered version.\n\nThe original picture shows a drone shot of the skyline at Myrtle Beach and not a storm, as the post claims.", "lang": "en"}
