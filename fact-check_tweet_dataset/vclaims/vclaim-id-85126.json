Coates had waited about a year for a colonoscopy at a VA hospital \u2014 and by the time he got one, doctors found that he had Stage 4 cancer and was terminally ill. The family later sued the VA over a misdiagnosis of hemorrhoids and reached a settlement.\n\nThe VA scandal unfolded in 2014 after whistleblowers alleged that employees at the Phoenix VA hospital manipulated patient wait-time data, leading to delays in access to health care and contributing to patient deaths. The VA Office of Inspector General later confirmed the allegations and found a systemic, years-long problem. Two years later, patients are still unable to get timely appointments with specialists at the Phoenix VA.\n\nIt was notoriously difficult to fire senior executives at the VA \u2014 which terminated executives at one-fourth the firing rate for all federal agencies from 2008 to 2013 \u2014 and the goal was to allow the VA chief to replace bad actors quickly, especially ones connected to the wait-time scandal.\n\nThe White House referred us to VA spokeswoman Victoria Glynn, who said the South Carolina VA medical center has \u201cmade significant and sustained improvement in the gastrointestinal department\u201d where Coates had tried to get a colonoscopy. There is more staffing, better data tracking and improved communication within the medical center, Glynn said. During the investigation of the department\u2019s procedures, the chief of gastroenterology resigned, a chief of staff retired and the chief of nursing was reprimanded, Glynn said.\n\nThe VA has terminated more than 4,095 employees since July 29, 2014, when McDonald was confirmed, Glynn said. But that does not capture people in charge of the facilities or people fired because of the wait-time problems.\n\nThat means three senior executives, who fit Obama\u2019s description of being \u201cin charge\u201d of the facilities, were fired after McDonald became secretary. Glynn said the Choice Act firing authority is not the only method for holding people accountable, so we asked how many people were removed with authority other than the Choice Act. We did not receive a response.\n\nAs of Sept. 22, the data available at the time of the CNN town hall, the VA had proposed 12 senior executive service employees to be removed or demoted under the Choice Act firing authority. Five were successfully removed. Only one removal, of former Phoenix VA director Sharon Helman, was marked as \u201ca case involving patient wait time.\u201d The VA attempted to discipline Helman for wait-time issues, but she ultimately was fired over failing to report thousands of dollars worth of gifts from a lobbyist.\n\nAmong non-senior executives, six employees were successfully removed in relation to patient wait times: an associate director, a chief of health administration service, a chief of staff, a medical support assistant, a nursing supervisor and a chief of medical service. That means five of the six fired non-senior employees were in some type of leadership or supervising roles.\n\nNo matter how many times administration officials try to spin this, the facts just don\u2019t support them. Twice, we awarded Four Pinocchios to McDonald for exaggerating the number of people fired over their actions relating to wait times. This time, Obama said \u201cwe have, in fact, fired a whole bunch of people who are in charge of these [VA] facilities.\u201d\n\nIn response to the VA scandal, Congress gave the department\u2019s chief authority to expedite disciplinary actions for senior executives (those \u201cin charge\u201d), especially relating to the wait-time problem. Since Obama signed the bill into law in August 2014, the VA proposed removals or demotions of 12 to 15 senior executives under the new authority. Three to five senior executives were successfully removed. Only one senior executive\u2019s removal was marked as \u201ca case involving patient wait time,\u201d but her actual firing was because of an unrelated ethics violation over accepting gifts. Five non-senior employees in leadership roles at VA medical centers were successfully removed relating to patient wait times.\n\nAlthough Obama said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cpretend that we are where we need to be,\u201d he did just that. The VA removed one to six people \u201cin charge\u201d for patient wait-time problems in the past two years. That\u2019s nowhere near \u201ca whole bunch.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
