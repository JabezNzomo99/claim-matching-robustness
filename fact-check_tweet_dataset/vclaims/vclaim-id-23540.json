The claim is false; the photo has been doctored from a 2006 photo of a surfer to include the whale.\n\nThe photo was shared here on March 2, 2016 by a Facebook page with more than 5,100 followers.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the midleading Facebook post:\n\nThe caption states: \u201cOnce in lifetime photo....Amazing!!!! surfing with whales\u201d.\n\nThe same photo has been shared with a similar claim on Facebook here, here and here. It was also shared on Twitter here.\n\nSome Facebook users left comments on one of the posts which indicated they believed the photo was real.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of some of the comments under one of the Facebook posts:\n\nBut the photo has been doctored from a 2006 photo of a surfer to include the whale.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found a mirrored version of the misleading photo showing a man surfing in this 2006 blog post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the photo published on the blog (R):\n\nThe photo published in the blog post is credited to photographer Tim McKenna.\n\nA keyword search on Google found this 2016 post by Tim McKenna on Instagram about the photo.\n\nIn the lengthy caption, McKenna states he captured the photo of surfer Manoa Drollet surfing in 2006, and digital graphic artist Julian Herbrig subsequently edited it to include the image of the whale.\n\nThe caption states: \u201cI shot the original photo of Tahitian surfer Manoa Drollet @dmanoa nearly 10 years ago , on July 28 th , 2006 at #teahupoo #tahiti.\u201d\n\n\u201cDigital graphic artist Julian Herbrig @care4art took the original photo and flipped it. Regular foot Manoa Drollet ends being a goofy foot charging a massive right hander.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe then added an aerial drone photo of a Blue whale in the face of the wave. \u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough we do see many humpback whales cruise by Teahupoo in winter time, I have never witnessed a blue whale in French Polynesia and certainly not trying to drop in at Teahupoo ! Certainly is catchy !\u201d\n\nAnother reverse image search found the photo of the whale was taken from a 2005 photo published here on the website for Iceland-based tour company Gentle Giants.\n\nThe web article, published on July 22, 2005, states: \u201cMINKE CLOSE UP. Our passengers onboard this afternoon really enjoyed the trip onboard Faldur, after a long search for the whale. They finally spotted this friendly Minke Whale which gave thim the show a good Minke should!! These photos are taken from the Crows Nest at Faldur by our guide Linda Gu\u00f0r\u00fanard\u00f3ttir.\u201d\n\nBelow is a set of comparison of the misleading photo (L) and the photo in the Gentle Giants post (R):", "lang": "en"}
