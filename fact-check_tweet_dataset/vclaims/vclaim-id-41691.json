Her deputy chief of staff has said that her office never tweeted the video.\n\nThe video shows a clip from the San Francisco Bay Area CBS affiliate KPIX\u2019s report about Pelosi visiting Chinatown on Feb. 24. In the video, Pelosi says, \u201cYou should come to Chinatown. Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern about tourism, traveling throughout the world, but we think it\u2019s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come.\u201d\n\nThough there were 21 active cases of coronavirus in California at the time, none were in San Francisco, KPIX reported. Her visit came three weeks before six Bay Area counties instituted shelter-in-place policies, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nA viral Facebook post alleged in a headline that Pelosi deleted a Feb. 24 tweet containing that video, despite no evidence that she did so. (RELATED: Does Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Daughter Sit On The Board Of The Kennedy Center?)\n\nThe Daily Caller searched for news reports corroborating the claim but only turned up articles from other fact-checkers debunking it. ProPublica\u2019s archive of deleted tweets from elected officials also has no record of Pelosi deleting the alleged video from her verified House Twitter account.\n\nWhile ProPublica\u2019s archive did not track her campaign Twitter account at the time, there is no evidence she deleted it from there either. Had the House speaker done so, there would likely be screen grabs of it, yet none could be found online.\n\n\u201cSomehow we didn\u2019t add her when we took over the app in 2016 from Sunlight, but we\u2019re tracking that account now,\u201d Derek Willis, a news developer at ProPublica, explained to the Caller in an email.\n\nDrew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff, denied that her office had ever posted the video.\n\n\u201cFact check: We never posted this video. It\u2019s obviously local TV coverage of the Speaker visiting Chinatown in San Francisco three weeks prior to the shelter-in-place order,\u201d Hammill tweeted.\n\nThe claim appears to stem from a tweet from President Donald Trump that accused the House speaker of deleting the same video.\n\n\u201cCrazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account. She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cBased on her statement, she is responsible for many deaths. She\u2019s an incompetent, third-rate politician!\u201d\n\nNeither the Trump campaign nor the White House responded to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
