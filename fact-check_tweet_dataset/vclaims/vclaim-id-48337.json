This was a process that was ongoing at the Institute, the Food and Drugs Authority, and the Centre for Plant Medicine.\n\nYet, some news sites had headlines which claimed the Institute had approved the drug to fight coronavirus.\n\nDubawa further found that Noguchi Memorial Institute and the Food and Drugs Authority had both refuted the claim that the drug had been approved as a coronavirus cure.\n\nSubsequent to this, a news report flagged to fact-checkers by Facebook as part of its Third-Party Fact-Checking Partnership claims the popular immune booster, COA FS, has been recalled by the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA).\n\nDubawa found that the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) issued a press release on April 17, 2020, notifying the public of a recall of COA FS as a result of laboratory analysis of samples of the drug which indicated excessive microbial, mold, yeast and E. Coli contamination.\n\nThe FDA indicated in the release that the contamination poses serious health risks such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting to consumers and that it can also lead to kidney failure and weakened immune systems.\n\nDubawa also spoke to the Head of Communication at Food and Drugs Authority, James Lartey, who confirmed the information. He stated that the contamination is subsequent to the approval of the drug by the FDA, although it appears it has been there for some time.\n\nMr Lartey emphasized that the drug itself is a good product and that it is just unfortunate that samples on the market have been contaminated.\n\nHe further stated that the recall does not affect the registration of the COA FS drug by the FDA in any way.\n\nThe FDA, in interviews with the media, has defended its claims and explained how it arrived at the conclusion that the drug is contaminated.\n\nThe manufacturers of COA FS are however contesting FDA\u2019s claim. In a press statement on April 21, they stated that results of microbial tests conducted on their product by the microbiology department of the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital do not support the FDA\u2019s claims of contaminations. They added that similar tests are being conducted in other independent laboratories.\n\nThe COA FS drug, an immune booster, which has recently gained popularity among Ghanaians as a potential cure for Coronavirus, has been recalled by the FDA, following laboratory results which indicated contamination of samples of the drug. The Head of Communication at the FDA, Mr Lartey, has stated that the recalling of the contaminated drugs does not, however, affect the registration of the drug under the FDA.", "lang": "en"}
