The version circulating in the Philippines highlighted a 28-day \u201csecond lockdown,\u201d supposedly happening from April 20 to May 18.\n\nIt also features an instruction: \u201cIn case Covid-19 patient ratio is zero, withdraw the lockdown.\u201d If not, a final lockdown will be imposed and this is to end on June 10, says the concocted advisory.\n\nIndian news outfits debunked the misinformation which began circulating in early April on WhatsApp, a messaging application owned by Facebook that is popular in the South Asian country.\n\nAccording to Boom, a fact-checking organization in India, the fake advisory is \u201cactually based on a research paper by two Indian-origin researchers at the University of Cambridge, which proposes a sustained lockdown with periodic relaxation to curb the spread (of the COVID-19 virus).\u201d\n\nThe WHO on April 21 said the lifting of lockdowns should be done step by step, warning of a comeback of the disease if restrictions are \u201crelaxed or lifted before strong systems are in place to identify, isolate and care for the sick, and trace and quarantine their contacts.\u201d\n\nIn a press briefing April 21, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said \u201cthere is still no decision (to extend the lockdown) from the President.\" However, there have been recommendations to \u201cmaintain, relax or lift the ECQ\u201d in various localities, depending on the number of COVID-19 cases in the area.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
