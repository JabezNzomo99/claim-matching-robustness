Remdesivir, whose safety and effectiveness are still being studied, can only be used in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Only the U.S., and just this May 7, Japan, have given emergency use authorization (EUA) for the drug, developed by biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nAn EUA for a drug can be issued if \u201cthere are no adequate, approved, available alternatives,\u201d according to a U.S. FDA fact sheet on remdesivir.\n\nThe misleading posts, published on May 5 and 6, were captioned, \u201cMay gamot na.mtatapos ka ng covid ka (There is a cure. You will end, covid)!!!!!!\u201d and \u201cCovid end.\u201d The posts re-uploaded an eight-minute May 5 video of former senatorial candidate Dr. Willie Ong talking about the U.S. FDA\u2019s recent move.\n\nIn the clip, Ong did not claim the drug will \u201cend\u201d the disease and only explained that a clinical trial found that hospitalized patients with \u201cadvanced COVID-19 and lung involvement\u201d who were given remdesivir recovered faster, or about four days earlier than those who did not get the same treatment.\n\nThe U.S. FDA also stressed that an EUA is different from FDA approval.\n\n\u201cThere are no medicines approved by the FDA as safe and effective to treat people in the hospital who have COVID-19,\u201d it said. It added that the EUA is in effect only for the duration that justified the emergency use of the drug amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRemdesivir is currently one of the four treatment options under study in the World Health Organization\u2019s international Solidarity clinical trial.\n\nThe misleading posts have been shared nearly 1,500 times.", "lang": "en"}
