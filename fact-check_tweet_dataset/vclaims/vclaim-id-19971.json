Published in March 2017, it\u2019s come to public attention more recently after Theresa May confirmed in an interview that the government supported the independent review\u2019s recommendations.\n\nThe basic message of the Naylor Review is that some NHS assets should be sold in order to improve the rest.\n\nRobert Naylor, the former head of a London hospital, was asked to \u201cdevelop a new NHS estate strategy\u201d. The \u201cestate\u201d is the land and buildings owned by the health service. It\u2019s a big deal: NHS trusts in England own 1,200 sites worth something like \u00a39\u201311 billion, according to Deloitte (although that second figure is a very tentative estimate). Even more assets come under NHS Property Services, a company owned by the government.\n\nThe NHS is under severe financial pressure. The Naylor Review said that the NHS doesn\u2019t have enough money to invest in things like buildings and equipment (\u2018capital\u2019 funding, as distinct from \u2018current\u2019 spending on day-to-day services). Robert Naylor thought that the service needs around \u00a310 billion: partly to fund the Five Year Forward View plan put forward by NHS leaders, and partly for the backlog of upgrades and repairs needed on existing buildings.\n\nThe report then looked at how much land could be freed if NHS organisations used their space more efficiently and how much money it would raise if it was sold. It arrived at an estimate of \u00a32.7 billion\u2014possibly more if things like planning permission went the right way.\n\nBut as a lot of NHS land and buildings are owned locally by trusts, rather than centrally by the Department of Health, the Naylor Review suggests pushing individual trusts to sell assets. Trusts are already charged 3.5% a year on the value of their land, but the review recommends going further by blocking trusts from getting capital funding from the government unless they set targets for selling land.\n\nThe NHS would end up with fewer buildings and less land, if all went to the Naylor Review plan. But the idea, at least on the face of it, is to use the remaining ones more efficiently and use the proceeds of the sales to repair and upgrade them.\n\nThere is no suggestion that this is intended to affect NHS services, although that would depend on how well (or badly) efficiencies are put in place.\n\nThe review says: \u201cRadical reconfigurations of services should not be undertaken simply to release additional land but will need to be based on a full clinical case for change, both improving services and delivering better value for money.\u201d It also talks about \u201cthe estate as an enabler to the provision of high quality clinical care\u201d.\n\nThe basic message of the Naylor review is that some NHS assets should be sold in order to improve the rest.\n\nOf course, investors won\u2019t buy land from the NHS or anyone else unless they see a profit in it at some point. Your view of these proposals depends, at least part, on whether you mind public property being sold into private ownership.\n\nA lot of the attention on Naylor Review seems to be down to a YouTube video with over 140,000 views at time of writing. The accuracy of this video at certain points suggests that it\u2019s worth being cautious about its conclusions.\n\nIt mentions the government \u201cjust gave\u2026 away\u201d land to NHS Property Services, a private limited company. Which is true, but what\u2019s missing is that NHS Property Services is owned by the Department of Health. NHS assets weren\u2019t just given to some lucky property developers; they were given to a state-owned company.\n\nThe video suggests, on the basis of a Wikipedia page, that the Chief Executive of NHS Property Services is Simon Stevens:\n\nThat\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s a misreading of the (correct) information on Wikipedia, showing Simon Stevens as Chief Executive of NHS England. The Chief Executive of NHS Property Services is Elaine Hewitt.\n\nMuch more importantly, it suggests that the \u00a310 billion cost mentioned in the report is the cost of readying these buildings for sale. That\u2019s the wrong way round: the \u00a310 billion is what the NHS needs to spend on keeping buildings. The point of the asset sales is to raise some of that money. There\u2019s no figure given for the cost of tidying buildings up in preparation for sale, but it couldn\u2019t possibly be anything like \u00a310 billion if the maximum possible income from those sales is \u00a35.7 billion as the review suggests.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s also concerned by the recommendation that the Treasury match revenue from building sales in a \u201c2 for 1\u201d offer. Mr Holden suggests that NHS organisations would be incentivised to sell land for less than it\u2019s worth, since they\u2019ll be guaranteed double the sale price (even if it\u2019s low).\n\nThat\u2019s possible. But as trusts will be keeping all the money they raise from these sales, it\u2019s not clear why they wouldn\u2019t want to sell for the highest possible price. From another perspective, you could say that they\u2019re promised an extra pound from the government for every extra pound they push up the sale price.", "lang": "en"}
