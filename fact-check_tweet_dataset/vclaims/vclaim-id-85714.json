There are now more than 60 claims that he has repeated three or more times. The president\u2019s impromptu 30-minute interview with the New York Times over the holidays, in which he made at least 24 false or misleading claims, included many statements that we have previously fact-checked.\n\nOne of these claims was some variation of the statement that the Affordable Care Act is dying and \u201cessentially dead.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges, despite well-documented issues, are not imploding and are expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Indeed, healthy enrollment for the coming year has surprised health-care experts. Trump used to say this a lot, but he\u2019s quieted down since his efforts to repeal the law flopped.\n\nTrump also repeatedly takes credit for events or business decisions that happened before he took the oath of office \u2014 or had even been elected. Sixty-one times, he has touted that he secured business investments and job announcements that had been previously announced and could easily be found with a Google search.\n\nWith the successful push in Congress to pass a tax plan, two of Trump\u2019s favorite talking points about taxes \u2014 that the tax plan will be the biggest tax cut in U.S. history and that the United States is one of the highest-taxed nations \u2014 have rapidly moved up the list.\n\nTrump repeated the falsehood about having the biggest tax cut 53 times, even though Treasury Department data shows it would rank eighth. And 58 times Trump has claimed that the United States pays the highest corporate taxes (25 times) or that it is one of the highest-taxed nations (33 times). The latter is false; the former is misleading, as the effective U.S. corporate tax rate (what companies end up paying after deductions and benefits) ends up being lower than the statutory tax rate.\n\nWe also track the president\u2019s flip-flops on our list, as they are so glaring. He spent the 2016 campaign telling supporters that the unemployment rate was really 42 percent and the official statistics were phony; now, on 46 occasions he has hailed the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years. It was already very low when he was elected \u2014 4.6 percent, the lowest in a decade \u2014 so his failure to acknowledge that is misleading.\n\nAn astonishing 85 times, Trump has celebrated a rise in the stock market \u2014 even though in the campaign he repeatedly said it was a \u201cbubble\u201d that was ready to crash as soon as the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. Well, the Fed has raised rates four times since the election \u2014 and yet the stock market has not plunged as Trump predicted. It has continued a rise in stock prices that began under President Barack Obama in 2009. Again, Trump has never explained his shift in position on the stock market.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. stock-market rise in 2017 was not unique and mirrored a global rise in equities. When looking at the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, it\u2019s clear U.S. stocks haven\u2019t rallied as robustly as their foreign equivalents. Yet Trump loves this claim so much that he has repeated it 28 times in the 49 days since our last update \u2014 more often than every other day.\n\nWe maintain the database by closely reading or watching Trump\u2019s myriad public appearances and television and radio interviews. The interviews are especially hard to keep up with, in part because the White House does not routinely post on them on its website. In fact, a recent redesign of the White House website appears to make it difficult to find transcripts of Trump\u2019s remarks at the White House.\n\nThis project originally started as a first-100-days database, but by popular demand we extended it to one year. We will soon face a decision about whether to maintain it beyond one year, even though it strains the resources (and weekends) of our staff. In at least one instance, the database was used for academic analysis. We welcome thoughts from readers about whether it remains a worthwhile endeavor.", "lang": "en"}
