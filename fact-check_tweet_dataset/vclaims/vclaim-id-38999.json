The claim is misleading; the Prime Minister\u2019s Office issued a statement denying Khan's salary had been increased; official legislation shows the Prime Minister's salary was last increased in 2012.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on January 30, 2020, and it has been viewed 9,300 times and shared 849 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post's Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \u201cFederal Cabinet has made a 300 percent increase in Prime Minister\u2019s salary. He was not able to make ends meet in 200,000 rupees, now his salary is 800,000\u2026..Uzma Bokhari.\u201d\n\nThe caption is a direct quote of comments made by Bokhari during the Nadeem Malik Live programme on the local television network Samaa TV on January 29, 2020; as seen from the 45-second mark of the video.\n\nShe is heard saying: \u201cToday the important news is that for which this whole drama is being created to hide a news and the news is that the federal cabinet has approved an increase of 300 percent in Prime Minister's salary. Now he was not able to make ends meet in 200,000 rupees, now reportedly that salary will be 800,000 rupees.\u201d\n\nA similar claim about a hike in Khan\u2019s salary were shared here, here, here and here on Facebook.\n\nThe claim is misleading.

The amendment was published in this official gazette on August 13, 2012.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant clause of the act that stipulates Khan\u2019s monthly pay is 107,280 rupees per month:", "lang": "en"}
