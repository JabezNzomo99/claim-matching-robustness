It was signed into law under former President George W. Bush, not Obama.\n\nThe claim started circulating after the Trump administration authorized the deployment of federal agents to help quell protests in Portland. There have been demonstrations in the city for weeks, with some centered around Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe meme being shared claims the Trump administration is using a law signed by Obama to authorize federal agents to \u201csnatch protestors off the streets in Portland.\u201d It includes a photo of Obama smiling.

She said it \u201cgives DHS the ability to deputize officers in any department or agency, like ICE, Customs and Border Patrol and Secret Service as quote \u2018officers and agents'\u201d to defend property owned by the federal government.\n\nUniversity of Texas School of Law professor Stephen Vladeck told The Associated Press that the meme is inaccurately attempting to reference the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (NDAA) signed under Obama. The NDAA included controversial provisions that critics argued would allow indefinite military detention of suspected terrorists without trial, according to the Washington Post.\n\nWalter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, also said in an email to the Daily Caller that the connection the meme makes to the NDAA was \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no connection between the law Obama signed and what is going on in Portland,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 2012 NDAA provisions apply to certain suspects believed to be associated with international terrorism against the United States, in particular Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. No one in the Portland unrest has been charged with any offenses like that. The 2012 law does not have anything to do with either the sending of federal law enforcement officers to Portland, or with the arrests or other actions taken by those law enforcement officers.\u201d\n\nVanderbilt University law professor Christopher Slobogin told PolitiFact that federal agents \u201ccannot snatch any protester off the streets, only those threatening federal property or personnel, or who are also committing some other federal crime such as drug trafficking or national security laws.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
