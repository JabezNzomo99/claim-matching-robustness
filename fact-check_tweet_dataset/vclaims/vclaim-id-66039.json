China has, North Korea has and they have consistently over many, many years.\"\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t reply to our emails seeking information to back Priebus\u2019 statement.\n\nBut experts told us that, aside from the Chung affair, there is no evidence that China -- and certainly not North Korea -- have meddled in American elections.\n\nAnd what U.S. intelligence agencies say the Russians did is far different from the Chung matter.\n\nHere is how the agencies began their key findings on Russian meddling in a January 2017 report:\n\nRussian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow\u2019s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity and scope of effort compared to previous operations.\n\nWe assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.\n\nAs has been widely reported, Russian hackers stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and gave them to WikiLeaks. Russian actors gained access to several states\u2019 electoral agencies.\n\nExperts believe that Russia was behind a misinformation and propaganda campaign pushing exaggerated or false stories that would spread on social media and get picked up by English-language conspiratorial websites.\n\nMost recently, in July 2017, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian agent who had promised to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton, and that the president's son knew the allegedly incriminating information was being peddled by the highest levels of the Russian government in order to support the Trump campaign.\n\nThe dozen experts we contacted said they were aware of no evidence to back Priebus\u2019 claim, or were aware only of the Chung matter.\n\nIn the Chung case, money was inappropriately or illegally given to a candidate\u2019s campaign account. Priebus\u2019 claim suggests a much broader and government-orchestrated foreign effort, on par with the Russian one.\n\n\"It\u2019s possible there is some classified intelligence report on China and North Korea and U.S. elections, but I have never heard this claim before, nor seen any evidence,\" said University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor Yoshiko Herrera, who is the former director of the school\u2019s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia.\n\n\"Also, I think for both China and North Korea, they see little difference between U.S. presidential candidates, but rather think of American politicians in general as opposed to China\u2019s or North Korea\u2019s interests, so I don\u2019t know what the motivation for meddling in elections would be.\"\n\nIndeed, Priebus\u2019 claim struck some experts as bizarre.\n\n\"I have never heard this charge before,\" said political science professor Robert Ross, an associate at the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University.\n\nExperts on North Korea were more blunt.\n\n\"This notion that North Korea meddles in American elections is completely baseless,\" said Mitchell Lerner, director of the Institute for Korean Studies at Ohio State University.\n\n\"It\u2019s sort of a stunning assertion,\" said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council in New York. \"I just don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from. There certainly is no evidence for it.\"\n\nSpeaking to Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Priebus said: \"It's an absolute fact\" that China and North Korea \"have consistently over many, many years\" meddled in U.S. elections.\n\nDuring President Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 reelection campaign, money from Chinese citizens, including the head of China\u2019s military agency, was illegally funneled to the reelection effort.\n\nBut there is no evidence that either China or North Korea -- consistently and over many years -- meddled in U.S. elections. And certainly nothing on the scale of the Russian efforts in the 2016 presidential race, which reached to the highest levels of the Russian government.", "lang": "en"}
