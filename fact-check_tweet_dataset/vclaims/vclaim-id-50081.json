The claim is false because the story shared with the viral photo is 'fiction'. AltNews found that the story was shared by a Facebook user, Syed Mohammad Fahim on June 30. Fahim clearly mentions at the end of the post that he wrote a 'fictional story in solidarity to all teachers who are victims of Zoom bombing by shameless students'.\n\nAlthough the page did credit the story to Fahim, it omitted the 'fictional' part. The post was shared along with the viral photo.\n\n This Instagram post was picked up by news portals. The viral image was found to be a screenshot of a video of an online class held in Bangladesh. Facebook user Hafiz R Rahman had shared the video on June 29.\n\nAccording to Hafiz's Facebook post, the teacher's name is Mohiuddin. The video shows an online class that the teacher had taken for the students of Milestone College, Dhaka and he was harassed. Rahman said that he is an ex-student of the college.\n\n A follow-up link was also attached to his Facebook post. The link leads to another video where he said that he has informed the college authorities of the incident.\n\nAlthough several people asked Rahman to take down the teacher's video, he said that he will take it down only after appropriate action has been taken against the student mentioned in his earlier post.\n\n If you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343", "lang": "en"}
