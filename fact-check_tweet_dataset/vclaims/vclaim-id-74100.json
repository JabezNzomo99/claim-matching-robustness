This has been promoted using a 30-second video, without any audio, that shows a helicopter shot down midair.\n\n\u201cRegards Nepal: Today, Indian airforces had crossed the border to conduct airstrikes on the Nepal territories. India contacted an airstrike in Belahiya. In the resulting, we\u2019ve shot down one Indian HAL Rudra and captured one Indian pilot. Now We\u2019ll not return pilot to India,\u201d wrote a Twitter user.\n\nTwitter user @Irmaknepal also posted the viral video, attracting 1,500 and retweets and over 50,000 views.\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search using InVid, a video verification platform, on Yandex that led us to a tweet by Hugo Kaaman that read \u201cSyria\u201d.\n\nIn 2019, he had posted the same video however with audio in the background. \u201cA Syrian Air Force (SyAAF) helicopter explodes mid-air as it descends after being struck by opposition anti-aircraft fire above Idlib countryside on October 17, 2012. One of the craziest and most iconic videos from the entire Syrian Civil War,\u201d read his tweet.\n\nUsing this as a clue, we performed a keyword search on Google and found that multiple media outlets had posted a video of the incident in October 2012.\n\nAs per The Telegraph, \u201cRebels downed a helicopter on Wednesday as troops fought to take back a key Syrian town, a watchdog said, as international peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi warned the conflict risks setting the region ablaze. Fighting for control of the Damascus-Aleppo highway raged around the northwestern town of Maaret al-Numan even as Brahimi appeared to have won tentative support for a ceasefire proposal.\u201d\n\nRami Abdelrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told Reuters that the helicopter had been downed near Maarat al-Numan.\n\nThus the social media claim that an Indian Air Force helicopter Rudra was shot down by Nepal and a pilot was captured is false. The video dates back to Syria from 2012.", "lang": "en"}
