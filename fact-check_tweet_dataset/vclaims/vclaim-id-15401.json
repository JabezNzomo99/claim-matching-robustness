Section 3 of the DepEd Order 36 series of 2016, which details what awardees receive, only indicates certificates, medals, and/or plaques being given to students with the highest honors.\n\n\u201cThe grade-level awardees shall receive certificates, medals, and/or plaques from the school, bearing the official seal of the Department,\u201d while \"certificates indicating the specific awards shall be given to all awardees,\" the order says.\n\nThe DepEd's Public Affairs Service told Rappler that \"nowhere in the same, or any issuance of DepEd did it mandate the granting of monetary incentive to any graduates of the basic education system.\" \u2013 Addie Pobre/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
