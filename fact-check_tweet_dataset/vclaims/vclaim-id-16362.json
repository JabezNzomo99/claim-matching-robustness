They show crimes recorded by the police are getting more severe, but they can\u2019t prove that serious crimes are getting more common.\n\nThe fact that different publications describe the \u2018rise\u2019 in serious crime differently just reflects different ways they\u2019ve chosen to present the same figures.\n\nWhat\u2019s all the fuss about?\n\nUsually, when it comes to measurement, a crime is a crime. An offence of murder is one crime. An offence of possessing cannabis is one crime. They would have counted equally towards the 4.6 million offences recorded by the police in England and Wales last year. We could still find the breakdowns by type of crime to get a better picture, but the national \u2018crime rate\u2019 gets the headlines.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a new way of doing things.\n\nStatisticians have come up with a way of \u2018scoring\u2019 different types of crime, according to their severity.\n\nHomicide gets a score of 7,979 under this method. Attempted murder gets 4,663. Possessing cannabis, on the other end of the spectrum, gets a score of three.\n\nWho decides how severe crimes are?\n\nSentencing data. The statisticians are trying to work out how harmful different kinds of crime are to society, and how they affect demands on the police. They decided on sentencing, ahead of other options, in part because:\n\n\u201cIt can be argued that sentencing is an objective measure, reflecting how society views crimes differently, given that it is based on legislation set by Parliament on behalf of the public.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t a perfect measure. Sentencing guidelines change over time, either because people view crime differently or to reflect changing government policies. Sentences also go beyond severity, for instance to reflect the offender\u2019s criminal record.\n\nWhat difference does this make?\n\nImagine the crime rate recorded by the police in 2002 was 100. By 2015, it would have been down to 69, on the same measure.\n\nNow imagine that crime rate of 100, but tracked over time by severity. It would be down to 76 in 2015.\n\nThe two measures have diverged since about 2014. Since 2010, police recorded crimes are up 5%, but by severity they\u2019re up 17%.\n\nWhy? The ONS says violent and sexual offences recorded by the police are rising, while less severe and more commonly recorded theft offences have been falling. When you take severity into account, the rises in these more serious offences look more pronounced.\n\nDoes this mean crime is now rising?\n\nRecorded crimes are getting more severe. But we can\u2019t conclude from recorded crime figures that crime is rising.\n\nThat\u2019s because they suffer from two familiar problems.\n\nFirst, they\u2019re based on police records at a time when the police are known to be changing how they record crime. Police forces across the country have been improving their recording in response to criticism a few years ago, and this has meant they\u2019re noticing more crimes. This is actually more of an issue for these new figures, because the police\u2019s improvements have focused on violent and sexual crime.\n\nSecond, high-profile coverage of sexual offences, and historical offences, are thought to have made people more willing to come forward and report crimes to the police.\n\nAs an alternative to the police figures, we have the Crime Survey for England and Wales. That shows crime that is experienced and recounted by adults has been falling consistently since the mid-1990s. That said, there are new changes to this measure as well, and in future it will include more information on fraud and \u2018cybercrime\u2019.\n\nThe ONS says that the crime score figures are intended mainly as a tool to help police forces and analysts understand the crimes happening in their local areas.\n\nSo why are different figures being reported?\n\nThat\u2019s just different ways of reporting the same change, although still with all the strings attached to what the figures can actually tell us.\n\nThe Mail says serious crimes are up by a fifth. That\u2019s a generous rounding of the 17% rise in crimes, weighted by severity, since 2010.\n\nThe Times says they\u2019ve trebled. That\u2019s comparing the 5% rise the usual police figures show, since 2010, to the 17% again.\n\nThe Telegraph is talking about Nottinghamshire when it talks of a 30% rise in the most severe crimes, comparing since 2012.", "lang": "en"}
