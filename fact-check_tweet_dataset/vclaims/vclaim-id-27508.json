The impact is so powerful that even the camera recording it shakes.\n\nClick here for the archived link.\n\nBOOM could ascertain that the video is not from Gurdaspur as images and videos of the aftermath of the blast in Punjab do not match that appearing in the video.\n\nTowards the end of the video, the camera pans towards the city, which is does not appear to be an Indian city.\n\nWe broke the video into key frames and ran a reverse image search, with relevant keywords. We were able to find the same video by The Telegraph, which featured the footage of a huge explosion at the Carlton Hotel, Aleppo, that shook the city in May, 2014.\n\nThe description of the video states the following: \"Footage purports to show moment an Aleppo hotel and several other buildings are flattened by a 'huge explosion'. A \"huge explosion\" in northern Syria levelled a hotel that government troops used as a military base, along with several other buildings in a government-held area, state television and activists reported on Thursday. \"\n\nThe attack was also reported by the BBC with the same footage. Below is an excerpt from the story.\n\nRebel fighters were believed to be responsible for the blast, placing a bomb in a tunnel beneath the hotel as government troops had been based there, BBC reported citing UK based -Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.", "lang": "en"}
