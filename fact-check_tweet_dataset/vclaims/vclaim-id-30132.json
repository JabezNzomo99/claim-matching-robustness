Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video shows Muslims being taken to detention centres by the Police in Assam. Fact: The video is not related to Assam. It was taken in Hyderabad (Telangana). In the video, the protestors were being arrested by the Telangana Police. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the video, it can be heard that the Police were talking in Telugu and the letters \u2018TSP\u2019 (Telangana State Police) can be seen on the uniform of the Police. So, it is related to Telangana, not Assam.\n\nAlso, it can be seen that there is a watermark \u2013 \u2018Azad Reporter\u2019, on the video. So, when searched with that name on Facebook, a profile with the name \u2013 \u2018Azad Reporter Abu Aimal\u2019 was found. It can be seen that he has uploaded the same video on his profile on December 19 with the description \u2013 \u2018Hyd Exhibition Ground me jo bhi protest me sharik horahe hain, Police unko hirasat me lerahi hai...\u2019 (English \u2013 Police are arresting anyone who is joining the protest at the Hyderabad Exhibition Grounds). A profile \u2018azad.reporter\u2019 on Instagram has also posted the video with the same description.\n\nTo sum it up, a video from Hyderabad is being falsely shared as \u2018Muslims being taken to detention centres by the Police in Assam\u2019\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
