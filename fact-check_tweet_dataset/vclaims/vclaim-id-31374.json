The video and website it was posted on have no apparent affiliation with CNN.\n\nThe video, which prompted much speculation on social media and garnered more than 635,000 views on YouTube, masquerades as content from CNN, with the video caption saying, \u201cThe Actor, Filmmaker, Musician, and Politician Dies Of Heart Attack At 89. He Was Filming A Commercial.\u201d\n\nHowever, the video did not actually come from CNN. It has not been posted on CNN\u2019s website nor the network\u2019s social media accounts. The website linked in the Facebook post also has no apparent affiliation with the cable news network.\n\nThe video\u2019s claim that Eastwood, known for roles in films like \u201cDirty Harry\u201d and \u201cMillion Dollar Baby,\u201d has died from a heart attack while shooting a television commercial doesn\u2019t hold up either. If Eastwood had passed away, it would have been reported by the media, yet no credible news outlets have picked up the story. Eastwood\u2019s family has not issued a press release.\n\nThis is not the first time that Eastwood has been the target of a celebrity death hoax. False claims of the actor\u2019s death also circulated in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
