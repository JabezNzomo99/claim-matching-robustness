Participants included cabinet members, California sheriffs and other elected officials.\n\nBut it was Trump\u2019s \"animals\" comment that sparked the most attention.\n\n\"Immigrants are not \u2018animals.\u2019 The president\u2019s statement was deeply offensive and racist. Immigrants are our family and friends, and they make significant contributions to our country,\" tweeted Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California.\n\nHowever, some have pointed out that Trump was not calling all immigrants \"animals,\" and rather made that comment in reference to MS-13 gang members, known for committing brutal crimes.\n\nTrump did not specifically mention MS-13 in the same sentence, but his comment came after a California sheriff said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot use her office\u2019s databases \"to find the bad guys\" and that \"there could be an MS-13 gang member\" she knows about, but can\u2019t tell the federal agency.\n\nMargaret Mims, Fresno County Sheriff: \"Thank you, Mr. President. You know, sheriffs in California are now in an untenable position when it comes to trying to figure out \u2014 now, we have state law, we have federal laws, and here we are stuck in the middle. Sheriffs, especially, because most of us run our county jails.\n\n\"When there became a legal challenge to the 48-hour holds for ICE, it was very frustrating for us. So what I did is I invited ICE to put their officers in my jails so they're able to do their work. We didn't have the staffing to be able to help figure out who they wanted to talk to or didn't. I said, come on in, work with our people to keep our community safe. Two weeks later, Mr. President, Kate Steinle was murdered.\n\n\"Now, I wasn't the only sheriff to do that. Sheriff Youngblood did, Sheriff Christianson. And it was perfect \u2014 because we didn't have to take our time, with our staff, to do, to do anything. ICE was in there doing their work in a safe, controlled, environment. And then, the initiatives started happening -- the TRUST Act, the TRUTH Act, and finally, SB 54, the Values Act. And that is causing us all kinds of turmoil.\n\n\"So here we are, stuck in the middle, trying to decide. We have federal law, we have state law. And that's why I welcomed Attorney General Sessions's lawsuit, because that will provide us the clarity that we need and direction that we need. What do we do? Because here we are.\n\n\"And I appreciated Mr. Homan and ICE. We had a great relationship; we still do. But now ICE is the only law enforcement agency that cannot use our databases to find the bad guys. They cannot come in and talk to people in our jail, unless they reach a certain threshold. They can't do all kinds of things that other law enforcement agencies can do. And it's really put us in a very bad position.\"\n\nTrump: \"It's a disgrace. Okay? It's a disgrace.\"\n\nTrump: \"And we're suing on that, and we're working hard, and I think it will all come together, because people want it to come together. It's so ridiculous. The concept that we're even talking about is ridiculous. We'll take care of it, Margaret. We'll win.\"\n\nMims: \"Thank you. There could be an MS-13 gang member I know about \u2014 if they don't reach a certain threshold, I cannot tell ICE about it.\"\n\nTrump: \"We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in \u2014 and we're stopping a lot of them \u2014 but we're taking people out of the country. You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people. These are animals. And we're taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that's never happened before. And because of the weak laws, they come in fast, we get them, we release them, we get them again, we bring them out. It's crazy.\n\nThe dumbest laws, as I said before, the dumbest laws on immigration in the world. So we're going to take care of it, Margaret. We'll get it done.\"", "lang": "en"}
