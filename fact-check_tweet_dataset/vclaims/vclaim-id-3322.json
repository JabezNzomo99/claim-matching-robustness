But the story \u2014 sweetened with a dash of retribution \u2014 is not true.\n\n\"Roy Moore\u2019s accuser arrested and charged with falsification,\" the Dec. 8 headline read.\n\n\"After it was discovered that Roy Moore\u2019s accuser is a liar and a Democrat, Alabama Attorney General John Simmons filed charges of falsification, a 1st-degree misdemeanor,\" the USA Mirror News story said. \"Mary Lynne Davies, who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14 years old and he was in his early 30s, now faces a year in prison and $10,000 in fines.\"\n\nIt isn\u2019t obvious from the headline, but the article was published by a website that warns readers it is a satirical publication.\n\nHere\u2019s how fake it is: There is no Mary Lynne Davies who has accused Moore. Nine women have come forward and there\u2019s not a Davies among them.\n\nOn top of that, the Alabama Attorney General is Steve Marshall, not John Simmons.\n\nThe only thing the item got right is that falsification is a misdemeanor under the Alabama State Legal Code.\n\nThe website has a disclaimer on its navigation bar, should any reader care to click on it:\n\n\"USAMirrorNews.com is a satirical publication that may appear sometimes to be telling the truth. We assure you that\u2019s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.\"\n\nSeveral other fake news sites carried this story.
