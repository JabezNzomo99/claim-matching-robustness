(RELATED: Did Ralph Waldo Emerson Say This Quote About Trailblazing?)\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched a collection of his complete works but no results were returned for this quote or any variation. The quote also does not appear in his personal letters.\n\n\u201cThat one comes up a lot \u2013 attributed to Emerson and Thoreau both \u2013 but was actually written by Henry Stanley Haskins. It is from his \u2018Meditations in Wall Street,'\u201d says Jeffrey Cramer, editor of \u201cThe Portable Emerson,\u201d in an email to the DCNF.\n\nIndeed, the website Quote Investigator found the earliest appearance of the quote in the book, \u201cMeditations in Wall Street.\u201d (This instance used the word \u201cbefore\u201d instead of \u201cahead.\u201d) The book was published anonymously in 1940, which Quote Investigator believes likely spurred the misattribution, despite the identity of the author later being revealed as Haskins, a New York stockbroker.\n\nThe saying has been falsely attributed to other famous figures, including writer Henry David Thoreau \u2014 as Cramer noted \u2014 and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
