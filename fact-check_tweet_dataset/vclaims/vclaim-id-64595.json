And it caught our attention.\n\n\"We spend more money than anyone else any other country in the world by a lot,\" he went on to say. \"And yet we're number 28 on the list \u2026 So we're 28 in terms of quality. So that means we have 27 countries ahead of us, and yet in terms of cost we're No. 1 by far.\"\n\nSpending that out-of-proportion to results would throw serious doubt on proposals to boost education budgets, so we decided to check it out.\n\nWe reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign, but they didn't respond.\n\nWe consulted data collected by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \u2014 an international organization of 34 developed countries \u2014 and by the United Nations.\n\nResearchers and policymakers from groups across the political spectrum told us they put the most stock in OECD data, which includes spending from both government and private sources.\n\nBased on 2012 data, the OECD shows that the United States has generous education budgets, spending about 50 percent more than the average OECD country.\n\nBut relative to the nation\u2019s overall wealth, the United States was at the middle of the pack. Relative to the size of the economy or overall government spending, U.S. levels were within 1 percent of the OECD average.\n\nAdditionally, the United States was not the top spender. Luxembourg, Switzerland and Norway each spent more per pupil than the United States. In the case of Luxembourg, about 66 percent more per secondary school student.\n\nAnd similar UN data puts the United States eighth among all countries, behind several other developed countries and Macau, a semi-autonomous city inside China.\n\nWe looked at a variety of other ways to crunch the numbers, but the United States never rose above No. 4. (see table) That was true even if figures were adjusted for purchasing power, the difference in what $1 buys from country to country.\n\nIn fact, the United States would have to increase per student spending about $8,000 per year just to match Luxembourg at the high school level. To spend quadruple what Luxembourgers do would require a $70,000 per student boost.\n\nSo what about us scoring \"No. 28\" among countries in education? There is ample evidence suggesting that U.S. educational performance is sub-par.\n\nFor instance, the OECD rated the U.S. 23rd out of the 25 countries for the percent of current students going on to pursue higher education.\n\nU.S. students were also 30th in math proficiency worldwide according to an OECD test. Meanwhile U.S. students were about average among developed countries for reading science.\n\nOr as Jason Bedrick, a policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, put it:\n\n\"The U.S. definitely spends more than most other industrialized nations and has less to show for it.\"\n\nTrump said the United States spends more on education per pupil by a factor of four and gets poor results.\n\nThere is good evidence to support his overall idea, that the United States gets less bang for its education buck than other developed countries. But Trump overstated U.S. spending by 500 percent. We\u2019re not No. 1 in spending, by several different ways of measuring. His comments suggest the country won the gold medal in spending when it\u2019s actually just shy of a bronze.\n\nWe rate his statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
