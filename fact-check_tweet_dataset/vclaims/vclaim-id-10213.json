President Trump thought this initiative held promise. It was announced that the sides had reached a preliminary agreement.\u201d\n\nLavrov said the U.S. Congress \u201craised a hue and cry\u201d over the proposal amid allegations that Russians had hacked into the email accounts of Democratic Party campaign officials and interfered with the U.S. presidential election campaign.\n\n\u201cThe established facts show that not a single Russian connection has been found,\u201d Lavrov said in the interview. \u201cAll the connections that have been found are internal, including at the Democratic National Committee, where an insider interfered with the process and leaked information to the rivals.\u201d\n\nLavrov\u2019s further claim that \u201cestablished facts show not a single Russian connection has been found,\u201d is incorrect. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, on January 6, released a declassified version of a U.S. intelligence community assessment detailing Russian cyber and information operations relating to the 2016 presidential election. The report was compiled by three US intelligence agencies --- the CIA, FBI, and NSA.\n\n\u201cWe assess with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release US victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks,\u201d the report states in its introduction.\n\nThe report also states that the Department of Homeland Security detected Russian cyber-intrusion into the computer systems of multiple state and local electoral boards, but found no evidence of tampering with vote tallies.\n\nIn his first year in office, President Trump has clashed with U.S. intelligence officials over the question of Russian interference in the election. Following a brief encounter with Putin at the APEC summit on November 11,Trump said the Russian leader once again denied meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cHe (Putin) said he didn\u2019t meddle,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI asked him again. You can only ask so many times. I just asked him again. He did not do what they say he did.\u201d\n\nFormer intelligence officials almost immediately disagreed. \u201cThe intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed,\u201d former CIA and NSA Chief Michael Hayden wrote on Twitter.\n\nSenator John McCain accused the commander-in-chief of placing national security at risk.\n\nTrump later appeared to retreat, \u201cAs to whether I believe it or not, I\u2019m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted. As currently led, by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.\u201d\n\nEven Russian President Vladimir Putin, while denying any state involvement, in June suggested the hack could have been the work of \u201cpatriotic\u201d Russian hackers.\n\nWhile Putin\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t an admission of the Kremlin\u2019s guilt, it contradicts Lavrov\u2019s claim about \u201cestablished facts\u201d not finding any Russian connection at all. In his interview this week, Lavrov also claimed that all the evidence surrounding the DNC hack was found to be internal, and leaked by an insider. While some fringe media outlets have promoted such a conspiracy theory, so far there has been no evidence to support the claim that the DNC\u2019s emails were stolen and leaked by an employee.", "lang": "en"}
