This made up over half of the delays. If we look just at delays due to social care then the number of councils is slightly lower.\n\nAround half of delayed discharges due to social care were in 20 councils\n\nLast November 2,425 patients had a delayed discharge from hospital at the end of the month because of problems with social care. If you include patients who were delayed because of a problem with social care and the NHS then it comes to 2,958.\n\nWhichever way you look at it about half of them were in 20 councils, out of a total of 152 across England.\n\nYou could also add up the total extra days each hospital bed was occupied by these patients. Again, about half were in just 20 councils.\n\nIf you look over the whole of 2015/16 it\u2019s a very similar picture. 22 councils made up half of the delays due to social care or a combination of the NHS and social care.\n\nIn other words, the issue of delayed discharges due to social care is concentrated in certain parts of the country.\n\nThe picture these figures are painting is that social care delays are hugely disproportionate: so few councils make up so many delayed discharges.\n\nBut part of that might just be down to population: the councils bearing the brunt also tend to be the ones with more adults living in them\u2014and more adults over the age of 65. The National Audit Office estimates that around 85% of people delayed in leaving hospital are in this age bracket.\n\nThe 20 councils with the most delayed discharges in November account for around a third of England\u2019s over-65s.\n\nYou could instead look at councils ordered by their delayed discharges per person.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund health think tank did just that, taking account of each area\u2019s population of over-65s. It found that about 33 local authorities accounted for half of delayed days in November. So a little less disproportionate on this measure.\n\nCounting population size also means some councils don\u2019t look quite as bad in the delays league table. Essex had one of the highest numbers of delayed discharges in 2015/16, but once you consider its relatively large population, it is below the national average.\n\nThere are other ways to compare delays around England\n\nThe NHS compares the various regions of England based on the average number of patients delayed each day, per 100,000 people living in that region.\n\nBy this measure the South West had the most delayed discharges for any reasons in 2015/16. This was followed by the West Midlands and the North West. The North East had the fewest delays.\n\nBut if you just look at delays due to social care then there were most delays in the West Midlands followed by the South West and the South East. Once again the North East had the fewest delays.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked before at the difference between the best and worst performing councils when it comes to social care and delayed discharges from hospital and how delayed discharges have increased between 2011/12 and 2015/16.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund has also pointed out that \u201cthere is an important caveat about the accuracy of these figures. If anything they are likely to underestimate the scale of the overall problem, irrespective of which organisation is responsible\u2026 Some of the variations may be due to local differences in how delays are recorded.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
