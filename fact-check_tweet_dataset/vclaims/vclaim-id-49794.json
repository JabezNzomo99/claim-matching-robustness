The video of this incident was viral on social media with a lot of praises coming the policewoman\u2019s way. A Twitter handle @yadavsunita143 began posting several tweets in support of Sunita Yadav since July 12. That same day at 4 pm, it wrote, \u201cI thought it appropriate to resign from the job rather than apologise to the son of a minister. Thank you for all your support.

It currently has more than 20,000 followers. In the replies of the above tweet, several users have congratulated Sunita Yadav for her work. Reading the comments section, it seems clear that people are believing this handle is the official handle of constable Sunita Yadav.\n\nThe account carried the word \u2018parody\u2019 in both its username and bio. This was later changed to only read \u201csunita Yadav constable Gujarat police\u201d.\n\nWe also found that the username of the account used to be \u2018@RealKomalMeena\u2019 which was changed to \u2018@RealKomalMahar\u2019 on June 25.\n\nLater in July, the account again changed its username to \u2018@Yadavteju111\u2019.\n\nIt is worth noting that @yadavsunita143 frequently posts follow-back requests by commenting on tweets of politicians, actors and prominent individuals.\n\nThe handle @yadavsunita143 is, therefore, an imposter account of Gujarat police constable Sunita Yadav.\n\nWho is behind @yadavsunita143?\n\nThe handle had tweeted a screenshot of its homepage in October 2019 which reveals its earlier username, @alokyadav521. The bio makes a follow request for @alokyadav58.\n\nThat @alokyadav521 and @alokyadav58 are the same people is proved by the tweets below.\n\nThe handle @yadavsunita143 is therefore run by the same person who runs @alokyadav58. @yadavsunita143 gained followers on Twitter by posting the same tweet on replies to politicians with \u2018Yadav\u2019 surname, especially those of Samajwadi Party (SP). A quick scroll of the timelines of @alokyadav58 and @yadavsunita143 shows that they regularly share tweets favouring SP.\n\nThere are several other fake handles running in Sunita Yadav\u2019s name \u2014 @sunita_yadav123, @Sunitayadav1143 \u0914\u0930 @GPsunitayadav. The constable took to Facebook to clarify the same and said that she will inform in case she makes an account on Twitter.", "lang": "en"}
