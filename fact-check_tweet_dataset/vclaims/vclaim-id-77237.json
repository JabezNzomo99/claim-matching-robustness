Harold Spunkmeyer, D-Ill., and Rep. Johnathon Leominster Jr., D-Mass., plotted to ambush Trump during a trip to Florida. The story quoted a federal agent as saying \"there was enough evidence when presented to the president for him to order us to take them as terrorism suspects.\"\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be from Illinois or Massachusetts to be able to quickly confirm that there are no members of Congress named Harold Spunkmeyer or Johnathon Leominster Jr. There also has been no record of any such arrests of other lawmakers, because the story isn\u2019t real.\n\nWe emailed ProudLeader.com to see if they knew that, since there\u2019s no disclaimer on the link, but never heard back.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the same post pop up on some other websites, but its origins are a familiar source: TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which posted the original story on Feb. 23.\n\nThe parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we\u2019ve previously checked.\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn\u2019t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\n\nThis claim, too, is total baloney.
