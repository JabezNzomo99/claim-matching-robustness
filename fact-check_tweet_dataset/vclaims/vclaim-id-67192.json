The debate got so heated that Wallace quipped, \"Maybe I\u2019ll stop calling you gentlemen.\"\n\nAt PunditFact, we wanted to spell out how the law affects existing plans.\n\nAs we\u2019ve , the has certain standards for what qualifies as comprehensive health care coverage. Outlined in section 1302(a) of the document on page 163, these 10 \"essential health benefits\" include emergency services, maternity care and mental health care.\n\nIf policyholders bought plans before Obama signed his reform into law on March 23, 2010, they\u2019re considered \" .\" They can keep their plans, so long as those plans don\u2019t change much.\n\nHowever, insurance companies that don\u2019t provide people with all of the benefits listed cannot market those plans to new consumers. That\u2019s leading to insurance companies ending a lot of their grandfathered plans, which won\u2019t be as profitable long-term without the potential attraction of new buyers.\n\nMany of the roughly 14 million people who buy their insurance individually (which means not through an employer) are receiving cancellation notices as insurers end those grandfathered plans.\n\nEmanuel\u2019s claim indicates that blame for these plan cancellations technically falls on insurance companies, not Obama and legislators. In an email we received from him after we initially published our report, he emphasized that it's the insurers who are taking action to end the policies.\n\nHow often do these types of cancellations happen? The fact is, there\u2019s not good data available on the number of individual, non-employer cancellations, so it\u2019s impossible to say how many health policies are canceled in a normal year versus in 2013, said Alan Sager, a Boston University public health professor who favors Obamacare.\n\n\"Some of them may be doing that because they know it\u2019s good business to get into compliance with the law\u2019s requirements earlier,\" Sager said. \"They may believe that offering better benefits gives them a competitive advantage.\"\n\nThat said, it\u2019s hard to argue that a sweeping health care reform law has no impact on changing behaviors of insurance companies in the absence of data. One of the law\u2019s intentions is to raise the bar for basic health benefits offered to consumers, so it\u2019s no surprise that individual policyholders with less comprehensive plans are finding themselves with cancellation notices.\n\nEzekiel\u2019s assertion that the law doesn\u2019t require insurance companies to cancel plans hinges on a technicality. It is up to insurers how they comply with the law, which mandates that policyholders be covered for 10 \"essential health benefits,\" except for plans that are grandfathered in. But there\u2019s little doubt the new law is influencing their changes in coverage. The law was designed to eventually do away with insurance that doesn't meet minimum coverage standards. We rate Ezekiel\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nEditor's note: This report has been updated to include a response we got from Emanuel after our initial publication.", "lang": "en"}
