Before you react, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you criticize, wait. Before you pray, forgive. Before you quit, try.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Hemingway ever saying or writing this, nor does it sound like him, according to one expert.\n\nWhile Hemingway\u2019s written works provide a plethora of lines ripe for quotation, these maxims did not come from the American novelist.\n\nHemingway authored such books as \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls,\u201d \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d and \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea,\u201d along with many short stories.\n\nHe did not, however, write the saying attributed to him in this image. The Daily Caller found no citation for when or where Hemingway would have written this, and it does not appear in any of his works.\n\nWhen asked about the quote, James Hutchisson, a professor of American literature at the Citadel who wrote a biography on Hemingway, told the Caller: \u201cVery unlikely that that is Hemingway. Never seen it before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am almost 100 percent sure that\u2019s not by Hemingway,\u201d Mary V. Dearborn, the first female author to write a biography of Hemingway, told the Caller in an email. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound at all like him, either stylistically or substantively. He\u2019d never advise praying, for one thing. In fact, I think he\u2019d sooner die than endorse something this conservative and, well, passive. He was far more proactive, even rash. Damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead.\u201d\n\nSearches for the true origin of the quote frequently return a poem attributed to William Arthur Ward. That poem reads, \u201cBefore you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you invest, investigate. Before you criticize, wait. Before you pray, forgive. Before you quit, try. Before you retire, save. Before you die, give.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Caller could not verify that Ward was the author of this poem.", "lang": "en"}
