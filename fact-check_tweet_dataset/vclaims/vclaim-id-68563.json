However, the government-led programme has said the advert is a fraud.\n\nThe post was shared on this Facebook page created to mimic the official Huduma Kenya Facebook page.\n\nHuduma Kenya is a project launched in 2013 by President Uhuru Kenyatta to improve access to government services.\n\nAFP established that the Facebook Page sharing the job advert was not the official account by following a link from the real Huduma Kenya website which leads to the real Facebook Page, which has over 36,000 followers.\n\nAt the time of going to press the false Facebook account had accrued 553 followers.\n\nThe misleading post appearing on the unofficial account has since attracted 240 comments, 91 shares, and 189 reactions. The same post was also shared on this Facebook Group.\n\nOn January 14, 2019, Huduma Kenya warned via its verified Twitter account that the advert was fake.\n\n\"Please be informed that Huduma Kenya is currently not hiring. Members of the public are, therefore, advised not to send money to anyone implying to assist them with employment at Huduma Centres. #OnlineFraudsters,\" the tweet reads.\n\nThe International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that youth unemployment in Kenya stands at 26 percent while the overall unemployment rate is 11.5 percent. A report by the British Council also estimates that 500,000 to 800,000 youths annually enter a job market that is struggling to absorb them.\n\nThe high rate of unemployment has led to a rising number of fraudsters advertising jobs on social media, with job seekers often required to pay a fee.", "lang": "en"}
