The post claims the road was funded by the Chinese and built as part of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's flagship infrastructure program. The claim is false and the road is not part of Duterte's official \"Build, Build, Build\" program.\n\nThe caption, when translated to English, says: \u201cBUILD BUILD BUILD. Father Digong's Build Build Build program is truly amazing, that's why the DDS are so amazed with it. When it's made in China, it's really something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at this newly-constructed road which was easily destroyed because it was thinly-paved. What can you say about Duterte's build build build program?\u201d\n\nA reverse image search found the photos in the post came from a November 24 report from Inquirer.net, a local news organization, about a truck that had sunk through a road in Quezon city, a Manila suburb.\n\n\u201cA box culvert under the pavement collapsed when a 22-wheeler truck loaded with sand passed over it on November 24, 2018. The box culvert was constructed by the Department of Public Works and Highways way back in the 1970s, and 10 meters of it collapsed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is just a box culvert, it's part of the regular road-building program of any local government. Build Build Build is for major road projects,\" she added.\n\nThe official website of the \u201cBuild Build Build\u201d program does not list the pavement of the road in Quezon city as one of its projects. The projects can be seen here.", "lang": "en"}
