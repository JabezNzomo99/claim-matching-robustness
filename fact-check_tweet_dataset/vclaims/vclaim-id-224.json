The accompanying text on these Facebook posts describes the linked video as being evidence of a COVID-19 vaccination trial.\n\nOne states: \u201cRemember the French doctors who openly say to test Covid-19 vaccination in, specifically, in Africa, live on national tv? Guess what, they are doing it right now. They even tested on children (they died, of course). Disturbing video in Guinea. WARNING: DISTURBING SCENES\u201d.\n\nThese posts are misleading. The video in question does not present evidence of COVID-19 trials having taken place in Guinea.\n\nWhen users click through to YouTube (here), the video headline reads differently. It is entitled: \u201cResults of vaccine trials in Dubreka - Guinea (MUST WATCH).\u201d\n\nThe video, which is a compilation of clips, contains an introductory sequence followed by part of an April 1, 2020, TV exchange between French doctor Jean-Paul Mira and the research director of France\u2019s national health institute, Inserm, Camille Locht, in which they discussed vaccine trials. Mira later apologised for the remarks he made during the exchange, in which he suggested that a possible treatment for COVID-19 should be tested in Africa (here).\n\nThe YouTube video then contains some commentary, before inserting a French-language news report that carries the logo of the Guinean TV station Gangan at 1:55 minutes (www.facebook.com/GanganRTV/).\n\nThe report matches that which was published by Gangan on its Facebook page on March 18, 2019 (here).\n\nGangan\u2019s original caption reads: \u201cWe start with this health info which provoked a spontaneous street demonstration this Monday in Dubreka. There, a dozen children are feeling unwell and admitted to hospital after a vaccination campaign. Parents accuse the vaccine administered to their children. Patients also point to the same vaccine that is believed to cause their discomfort.\u201d\n\nAfter being approached by Reuters, Gangan RTV\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Sekou Jamal Pendessa confirmed that his organisation\u2019s footage had been used out of context in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cThe editorial staff of the Gangan RTV group notes with deep regret that some internet users have been allowing themselves, since Monday, April 6, 2020, to use one of our old reports to make people believe that there, in recent days, cases of discomfort due to a vaccination campaign in schools in Dubreka.\n\n\"We would like to point out here that the report was produced in March 18, 2019. We invite you to refrain from such games during this sensitive period marked by a global health crisis,\u201d he added (here).\n\nGangan TV\u2019s report was actually about a drug treatment programme to reduce the prevalence and intensity of the parasitic infection schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever, in school age children in Dubreka last year.\n\nA subsequent report compiled by Sightsavers, an NGO behind the health scheme, said the programme had to be stopped during the first day of distribution due to community unrest after some children suffered adverse side effects such as dizziness and fever.\n\nSightsavers has confirmed to Reuters that the Gangan TV report was indeed coverage of the aftermath of the schistosomiasis programme in Guinea. The NGO stressed the treatment was administered by health workers employed by Guinea\u2019s Ministry of Health and that no French doctors were involved, nor had there been any deaths as result of the treatment using the medicine Praziquantel.\n\nFalse. The video being shared on social media centres around a 2019 report into a schistosomiasis drug treatment programme and is in no way linked to COVID-19.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
