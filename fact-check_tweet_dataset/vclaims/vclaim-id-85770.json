In explaining his decision, Boehner repeated a myth \u2014 that the United States has \u201cfilled up our jails\u201d with nonviolent people whose only crime was that they possessed marijuana. (There\u2019s a difference between jails and prisons, as jails are run by local law-enforcement for short-term stays, but Boehner began by speaking about \u201cthe number of people in our state and federal penitentiaries,\u201d so he\u2019s really referring to prisons.)\n\nBut relatively few of those arrested end up in prison. Most prisoners are in state systems, and the Department of Justice does not break down exactly the percentage of people who are in prison for marijuana possession \u2014 just all types of drug possession, including hard drugs such as heroin. The federal data, however, does provide that breakdown.\n\nSo what do we find? In the state correctional institutions, only 3.4 percent of prisoners were in jail for all types of drug possession as of Dec. 31, 2015, according to the Justice Department. While Boehner claimed that the prisons have been filled with nonviolent prisoners, the data show that 54.5 percent are in prison for violent crimes such as murder, rape and robbery and 18 percent involve property crimes; another 11.6 percent are in prison for public order offenses.\n\nIn the federal system, the numbers for marijuana possession are astonishingly low. Only 92 people in 2017 were sentenced for marijuana possession in the federal system out of a total of nearly 20,000 drug convictions, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. That is one-half of 1 percent. Out of all of the drug possession charges, marijuana possession made up 43 percent of all of the drug possession cases.\n\nIf that ratio held true in the state prison population, that would mean about 19,000 prisoners for marijuana possession, out of 1.3 million. That\u2019s about 1.5 percent. (Note: this is only intended as a very rough illustration, given the paucity of the data. Indeed, Fordham University Professor John Pfaff, who has closely studied the data, concluded the number in prison for marijuana possession could be as low as 0.1 percent. But he says the data used to generate that number had a lot of limitations.)\n\nJonathan P. Caulkins, professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, noted that when reviewing the data, it\u2019s important to remember that there are several ways that simple marijuana possession can lead to incarceration: It was a violation of probation or parole for another conviction; it was part of a charge bargain down from a more serious offense; it was a \u201cthird\u201d strike under some three-strike laws (e.g., if on probation or parole, then a misdemeanor can be promoted to a felony so it can be a third felony).\n\nSince this was directly contradicted by the Justice Department data, we sought an explanation. It turned out that either through a reporting or editing error, Newsweek garbled a statistic borrowed from a Washington Post article. After our inquiry, Newsweek quickly corrected the article to say that marijuana possession accounts for more than 5 percent of all arrests, not incarcerations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that America\u2019s jails are overcrowded; Speaker Boehner\u2019s point was that the incarceration of nonviolent individuals for possession of small amounts of cannabis is contributing to the overcrowding problem and that adjusting our laws to reflect changing public sentiment on the issue, as many states today are already doing, can help address the problem,\u201d Schnittger said. \u201cThe speaker is not attempting to make the claim that incarcerations for marijuana possession are the primary reason America\u2019s prisons are overcrowded. He is arguing that our prisons are overcrowded, and that reducing the number of people who are incarcerated for something that many Americans today no longer even believe should be illegal is a logical place to look when we\u2019re looking for ways to stop \u2018filling up our jails.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe often warn politicians that they should not simply rely on a news report for information. The Newsweek report should have raised a red flag to anyone who had studied the federal data \u2014 and indeed it was wrong. Kudos to Newsweek for quickly correcting the story.\n\nUnder no stretch of the imagination has the United States \u201cliterally filled up our jails with people who are nonviolent.\u201d Very few people end up in prison for marijuana possession, and those who do are probably there for another complicating factor. Boehner says he doesn\u2019t personally indulge, inhaling only Camel cigarettes. But either way, he\u2019s blowing smoke here. He earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
