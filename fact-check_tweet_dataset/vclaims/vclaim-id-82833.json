Nobody asked me \u2014 I wasn\u2019t a politician. It was probably the first time anybody asked me that question.\u201d [\u2026]\n\nTrump: \u201cBy the time the war started, I was against the war. And there are articles \u2014 I mean, there are headlines in 2003, 2004 that I was totally against the war. And actually, a couple of people in your world in terms of the pundits, said, you know, there\u2019s definite proof in 2003, 2004 Trump was against it.\u201d\n\nThe newly published audio recording is an interesting twist to Trump\u2019s long-held assertion that he opposed the Iraq War ahead of the invasion in 2003. Still, Trump continues to repeat his false claim that his opposition made \u201cheadlines\u201d in 2003.\n\nDuring the town hall, Buzzfeed published a recording of Trump\u2019s Sept. 11, 2002, radio interview with Howard Stern. Stern asks: \u201cAre you for invading Iraq?\u201d Trump answers: \u201cYeah, I guess so. You know, I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d\n\nWhen Cooper asked about the recording, Trump explained that he \u201cmay have\u201d said he supported invading Iraq: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the private sector, you know, you get asked things and, you know, you\u2019re not a politician and probably the first time I was asked. By the time the war started, I was against it. And shortly thereafter, I was really against it.\u201d\n\nIs Trump suggesting he gave a different answer because he was in the private sector? That doesn\u2019t jibe with Trump\u2019s comments during the latest GOP debate that he opposed it, despite being in the private sector:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one on this stage that said, \u2018Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq.\u2019 Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn\u2019t a politician, fortunately. But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, \u2018You\u2019ll destabilize the Middle East.\u2019 That\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker\u2019s extensive review of news coverage prior to the invasion surfaced just two references of Trump and his views. There were no \u201cheadlines\u201d in 2003, but a two-sentence reference in a March 25, 2003, article in The Washington Post\u2019s coverage of the Oscars after-party.\n\nTrump also made a comment on Fox News during the weekend after the invasion: \u201cI think the market\u2019s going to go up like a rocket!\u201d However, on Feb. 19, Buzzfeed published an audio clip of Trump\u2019s entire comments from what appears to be the same Fox News interview \u2014 and Trump actually praised the invasion:\n\n\u201cWell, I think Wall Street\u2019s waiting to see what happens but even before the fact they\u2019re obviously taking it a little bit for granted and it looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint and I think this is really nothing compared to what you\u2019re gonna see after the war is over. \u2026 I think Wall Street\u2019s just gonna go up like a rocket, even beyond, and it\u2019s gonna continue and, you know, we have a strong and powerful country and let\u2019s hope it all works out.\u201d\n\nTrump clearly was outspoken about his opposition starting in 2004 and was cited in news coverage at the time. But that was said long after the war started \u2014 and Iraq was unraveling under the U.S. occupation.
