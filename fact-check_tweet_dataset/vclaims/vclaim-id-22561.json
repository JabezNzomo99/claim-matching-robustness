And he has made it clear he\u2019ll criticize Republican Gov. Scott Walker on infrastructure ahead of the general election.\n\nThere\u2019s room to criticize Walker on infrastructure, particularly when it comes to roads.\n\nBut Evers went beyond just roads in making his claim. And he cherry picked a ranking that is too-narrow and not up to date.\n\nLet\u2019s start by noting there is not a universal definition of infrastructure, as various rankings show.\n\nU.S. News & World Report, in its \"Best States 2017\" ratings,\" ranked Wisconsin 39th in infrastructure \u2014 which included an assortment of factors, such as roads, bridges, renewable energy usage, broadband access and others.\n\nRoad quality was where Wisconsin ranked 49th. That\u2019s where Evers got his statistic.\n\nBut again, roads are only one part of infrastructure.\n\nAnd there are at least three more recent rankings on infrastructure \u2014 including the current one by U.S. News -- where Wisconsin is in the middle, or even higher:\n\nU.S. News & World Report: In the magazine\u2019s \"2018 Best States\" report, released in February 2018, Wisconsin ranked 26th overall on infrastructure.\n\nThat included a ranking of 14th in energy \u2014 for electricity price, power grid reliability and renewable energy usage; 41st in internet access \u2014 for broadband access and ultra-fast internet access; and 34th in transportation \u2014 for road quality and bridge quality, commute time and public transit usage. (Specifically on road quality, Wisconsin ranked 44th, up a bit from 49th.)\n\nCNBC: The business news TV network said it evaluated road and bridge quality, commute time, the availability of air travel and other factors to rank the states on infrastructure. For 2018, Wisconsin ranked 23rd.\n\n24/7 Wall Street: The financial news website ranked the states in early August 2018 with an index using the share of bridges, roads and dams that are \"in a state of disrepair or potentially hazardous,\" and it looked at state highway spending per person. On that measure of infrastructure, Wisconsin ranked 15th \u2014 as in 15th worst, as this ranking was done differently.\n\nWe\u2019ll also note that the American Society of Civil Engineers rates the nation\u2019s infrastructure in 16 categories, including roads and bridges. Its most recent report, for 2017, gave the nation a grade of D+. That report says that in Wisconsin, \"driving on roads in need of repair\" costs each driver $637 per year and 8.7 percent of the state\u2019s bridges are rated structurally deficient. But the report doesn\u2019t give grades to the states and doesn\u2019t rank the states.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, with regard to roads, that we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that he had invested $3 billion more in the state\u2019s transportation system than his predecessor did. And our rating was Mostly False when Walker said state road projects \"are staying on track or getting done sooner.\"\n\nEvers says Wisconsin is \"49th out of 50 states in infrastructure.\"\n\nHis statement relies on a too-narrow ranking that isn\u2019t current, and it ignores other rankings.\n\nIn 2017, U.S. News & World Report ranked Wisconsin 49th in road quality \u2014 but 39th in overall infrastructure, based not only on roads but bridges, renewable energy usage, broadband access and other factors.\n\nMoreover, the magazine\u2019s 2018 report ranks Wisconsin 26th in infrastructure. And Wisconsin is well above the bottom, though not great, in two other national rankings.", "lang": "en"}
