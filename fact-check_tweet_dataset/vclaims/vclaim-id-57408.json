Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Traffic signal post being swept away in a flooded street of India. Fact: In 2018, due to the heavy rain, a temporary traffic signal post was swept down in the flooded streets of Yulin city in South China. It is an old video and not related to India. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn observing carefully, we found that names on the signboards and stickers on a bike are not in any of the Indian languages. When we searched for the language on the signboards and stickers, we found that it is Mandarin, the official language of China and Taiwan.\n\nOn reverse image search of screenshots in the video, we found a similar video in the official YouTube channel of Chinese Government news channel \u2018CGTN\u2019.
