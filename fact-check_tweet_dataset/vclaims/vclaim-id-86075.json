The researchers surveyed a random sample of 3,299 households, representing 9,522 people, and obtained answers from about 93 percent. The survey participants identified 38 people who died after the hurricane through December. Of that number, three died directly from medical complications, illness or trauma because of the hurricane, and 12 died because of the interruption of medical services in the aftermath. The other 23 deaths were reported to be unrelated to the storm.\n\nFrom that base of survey data, the researchers extrapolated to the whole island and came up with a range of excess deaths. That range is 793 to 8,498, with a 95 percent confidence interval. This means, according to the researchers, that \u201cif one had unlimited resources, and continued to take random samples, 95 percent of the resulting confidence intervals would include the actual death count.\u201d The widely reported number of 4,645 is simply the midpoint and is no more or less valid than any other number in the range. (Note: the third sentence has been rewritten to directly quote from the document, as various experts have contacted The Fact Checker with differing definitions of a 95-percent confidence interval.)\n\nThe researchers said the confidence interval is so large because \u201cdeaths are relatively rare events,\u201d and so many more households would need to be surveyed to narrow the range: \u201cThis was a quick study on a limited budget. With more time and resources, we would recommend a larger sample size in order to narrow the range of estimates.\u201d They also noted they did not have access to the demographic registry data, like other researchers, because the government stopped sharing data.\n\n\u201cTheir sampling appears to be well done, but relatively small for their purpose, leading to a large margin of error,\u201d said Roberto Rivera, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayag\u00fcez who co-wrote the study that calculated a range of 605 to 1,039 deaths. \u201cMost reports on the new study have focused on the number 4,645. But the authors of the paper included a margin-of-error-based confidence interval: 800 to 8,500. This interval is the most important part of their results. First, it is evidence that the death toll is much greater than 64. Secondly, it shows that the margin of error is very large.\u201d\n\nSteven Kopits of Princeton Policy Advisers, an advisory firm, is a critic of the Harvard study. He notes that the available registry data, which still is incomplete, indicates 654 excess deaths above the previous year through December. (Note: More recent data released by Puerto Rico after this fact check was published suggests the number is closer to 1,400.) On the face of it, he said, the Harvard number makes little sense because that means 3,000 bodies would be missing \u2013 when only 45 were reported as missing as of December.\n\n\u201cWith the power outage following the hurricane, residents in ill health and near death died prematurely for lack of access to life-sustaining services like respirators, dialysis and air conditioning,\u201d he said. \u201cThese deaths were principally attributable to an extended loss of power. On the other hand, most of these people were under the care of family or professional staff, and their deaths were recorded in near real time. Virtually all those who died in 2017 have been properly accounted for. There are materially no missing bodies.\u201d\n\nAnother critic is Donald Berry, professor of biostatistics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. \u201cThe results are statistically weak and nearly useless, at least insofar as number of deaths is concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother way of conveying the confidence interval 793 to 8498 is 4645+/-3852. The error is almost as big as the estimate.\u201d He also faulted the researchers for using a different methodology \u2014 official deaths for all of Puerto Rico\u2014 as a comparison for 2016. \u201cThey should have used deaths in 2016 only the same 104 barrios they considered in 2017,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement about the Harvard study, GWU\u2019s Milken Institute, which is conducting the official study for the Puerto Rican government, urged caution about the numbers. The institute noted that it will use \u201cactual data about death,\u201d such as death certificates, which it described as \u201ca more accurate way to assess mortality.\u201d The statement noted the Milken study \u201cis expected to provide a narrower range of uncertainty around the estimated excess deaths tied to Hurricane Maria.\u201d\n\n[Update, Aug. 28: GWU\u2019s Milken Institute released its report, estimating excess deaths at between 2,658 and 3,290, with a midpoint of 2,975, in the six months after the storm made landfall. This is a longer period of research than previous studies; GWU estimated 2,098 excess deaths through December (the period also covered by the Harvard study) and 1,271 for September and October (the period covered by most of the other studies). GWU said it counted until February because people continued to die at anomalous rates long after the storm, as the island struggled with infrastructure failures and political infighting. After the release of the report, the government of Puerto Rico embraced 2,975 as the official death toll.]\n\nAll too often, the news media grabs onto a number in an academic report and puts it in headlines, ignoring the caveats deep in the report. Given that this report is based on a survey, with potentially huge margins of error, it should be treated cautiously. Five other studies, based on preliminary death certificate data, have all come up with much lower numbers \u2013 about 1,000 in the two weeks after the storm.", "lang": "en"}
