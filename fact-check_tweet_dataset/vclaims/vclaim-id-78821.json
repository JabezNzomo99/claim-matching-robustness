The site says it is a social media platform where \"cannabis enthusiasts\" can discuss information related to marijuana.\n\nThe post says Carter had become a cannabis connoisseur since being diagnosed, and credited a medical marijuana purveyor in Oakland, Calif., for helping find a proper strain of the drug.\n\nFacebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake, as part of the social media network\u2019s efforts to thin out fake news stories. While the story goes back to 2015, it was shared on Facebook more than 1,000 times in the past seven months. Versions of the same story have appeared in links from other websites, as well.\n\nIn 2015, Carter was really diagnosed with skin cancer that had spread to his brain, but in December of that year announced the cancer\u2019s growth had been arrested and reversed. Instead of medical marijuana, Carter announced he had been trying a new drug called Keytruda that appeared to help control and reverse the metastatic melanoma.\n\nThe fake story, meanwhile, appears to have originated from a Dec. 7, 2015, post on a site called SatiraTribune.com. There\u2019s no disclaimer on the site, but their Facebook page notes that SatiraTribune publishes \"satirical and futuristic news.\"\n\nThe story is full of cliches about smoking marijuana, including Carter being forgetful and having the munchies for peanuts. It also says Carter would be supporting legalization efforts in several states.\n\nCarter\u2019s own record on marijuana is a little hazier than the story makes it out to be. He suggested to Congress in 1977 that possession of up to one ounce of marijuana should be decriminalized, in an effort to keep people out of prisons for smoking the drug. When a CNN anchor asked him in 2012 whether he supported legalization, he said, \"I\u2019m in favor of it. I think it\u2019s OK.\"\n\nHe recently clarified his position in 2013: \"I do not favor legalization,\" he said at a meeting of state legislators and regulators. \"We must do everything we can to discourage marijuana use, as we do now with tobacco and excessive drinking.\"\n\nBut perhaps the biggest giveaway is a faked quote from Carter that reads, \"I smoke two joints in the morning, I smoke two joints at night, I smoke two joint in the afternoon, and it makes me feel all right.\"\n\nThat\u2019s actually the opening line from The Toyes\u2019 1983 weed anthem \"Smoke Two Joints,\" although many people instead refer to Sublime\u2019s 1992 cover, or even Macy Gray\u2019s 2012 interpretation. We don\u2019t know which version Carter would prefer.\n\nAt any rate, this is a fake story that sparked a wave of readers being fooled. We rate it Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
