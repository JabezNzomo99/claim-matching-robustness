Most iterations of the claim point to a profile of Chauvin on the cinema and television database IMDb, implying the death was somehow staged. The profile, however, was created after Floyd\u2019s death and Chauvin\u2019s only listed \u2018credits\u2019 are in news and talk shows that have featured the case.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here , here , here and here\n\nOne post reads: \u201cWe have so been duped! Again! A false flag! Derek Chauvin is an actor.\u201d It describes the killing of Floyd as a \u201cfake death\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for IMDb told Reuters that Derek Chauvin\u2019s profile (visible www.imdb.com/name/nm11618340/ ) was created on May 28, 2020, three days after Floyd\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cMany people who are not actors have profile pages on IMDb, due to the nature of their work (for example, if they\u2019re interviewed on a television news program or documentary)\u201d, the spokesperson told Reuters via email. \u201cThe word \u2018actor\u2019 doesn\u2019t appear next to [Chauvin\u2019s] name because he doesn\u2019t have any acting credits\u201d.\n\nThe listed appearances include episodes of the Today show ( here ) and Australian news shows such as the Kenny Report ( here ) and the Bolt report ( here ).\n\nThe page was likely either created because of the featuring of Chauvin in television news reports around the world or by users seeking to propagate the unfounded claims that the death was a conspiracy.\n\nAny suggestions that Chauvin was not a police officer are false. Public officials including the Minneapolis police chief have repeatedly stated that all four of the men who arrested Floyd and were at the scene of his death were officers. They have since been dismissed from the force. ( here )\n\nNumerous media reports have detailed Chauvin\u2019s policing record, and complaints made against him, during his career of nearly two decades at the Minneapolis Police Department ( here , here , here, here )\n\nOn May 29, 2020 Derek Chauvin was arrested for third-degree murder and manslaughter charges for his role in the death of 46-year-old George Floyd ( here ).\n\nFalse. Derek Chauvin is not an actor and worked with the Minneapolis Police Department for nearly two decades.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
