Putting 3 children's bodies in one bag in hospital in wuhan china. to save two bags or to count only one in death toll?\"\n\nThis is false. First, there is no proof the video was taken in Wuhan.\n\nAmong the earliest uploads of the clip was published on Twitter. After several netizens presumed the video was taken in Wuhan, the publisher of the clip on Twitter wrote in a follow-up tweet, translated from Chinese: \u201cWe didn\u2019t say it was in Wuhan.\u201d\n\nAn article published by British tabloid Daily Express places the video in Hangzhou, Zhejiang -- an eight-hour drive from Wuhan -- and claims that the children died of carbon monoxide poisoning \u201caccording to media reports.\u201d However, no other news organization has reported this information.\n\nA reverse image search of the clip\u2019s key frames reveals it has been making the rounds on the Web as early as Feb. 11, according to Taiwanese media TVBS News Network and Liberty Times and a U.S.-based website Vision Times that reported on a copy of the footage uploaded on YouTube. The YouTube clip has since been deleted.\n\nThe TVBS, Liberty Times and Vision Times stories did not conclude that the video was taken in Wuhan.\n\nSecond, the video that was published by at least three local netizens from May 22 to 26, has been circulating as early as February, rendering false the suggestion that it indicates a \u201csecond wave\u201d situation.\n\nWuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus disease outbreak in China, was placed on lockdown on Jan. 23 and reopened on April 8. The city recorded new cases on May 10, prompting authorities to order a mass testing of its population.\n\nThe discovery of new cases early May led its local government to launch a campaign aiming to test all of Wuhan\u2019s 11 million residents in order to prevent a second wave of the outbreak. It currently only has six confirmed cases as of May 25.\n\nRecent reports by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and news.com.au cite the Wuhan government as saying it has tested nine million people from May 14 to 25. It recorded about 218 asymptomatic carriers of the coronavirus, \u201cwho were put under quarantine and monitored for symptoms,\u201d according to the WSJ story.\n\nThe netizens' posts surfaced two days after Health Secretary Francisco Duque III announced the Philippines is facing a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. An official from the Department of Health clarified a day later that the country is still facing its first wave of \u201csustained community transmission.\u201d\n\nThe two netizens\u2019 videos have collectively been shared over 800 times and have nearly 30,000 views. Another version of the false posting, which has since been taken down, was shared more than 8,700 times and was viewed over 320,000 times.", "lang": "en"}
