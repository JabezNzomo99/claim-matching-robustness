Ilhan Omar saying the Democratic Minnesota congresswoman \"wants to redefine U.S. foreign policy as we know it.\"\n\nOmar elaborated on her philosophy by addressing military spending.\n\n\"We can fight to have our Green New Deal. We can certainly get Medicare for All. We can cancel out student debt. We can certainly pass our Housing for All bill. We can get a universal school meals program up and running,\" she said.\n\n\"But in order to do all of those things, we have to stop policing the world, right? We have to not have over 800 military bases around the world. We have to not spend 57 cents on the dollar on defense.\"\n\nDefense spending accounts for only 15% of the federal budget.\n\nIn 2015, we rated as False a claim that 57% of federal spending goes to the military and just 1% goes to food and agriculture, including food stamps.\n\nRather than being dominated by the military, the budget was actually dominated by spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, we found.\n\nAt the time, military spending, including spending on homeland security, accounted for 54% of discretionary spending \u2014 that is, not-mandatory spending.\n\nBut it accounted for only 16% of federal spending overall.\n\n\"This is a common mistake,\" Robert Bixby, executive director of the centrist Concord Coalition, which works for fiscal responsibility, said about Omar\u2019s claim.\n\nIn fact, a spokesman for the congresswoman said Omar was referring to discretionary funding. He cited a Washington Post article that says defense would be 57% of discretionary spending in the 2020 federal budget request unveiled by President Donald Trump in March 2019.\n\nThe percentage of the total federal budget spent on defense has been in the same range for years.\n\n2011: About 25%, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker\n\n2017: 15% according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\n\nCurrently, about 17% of the federal budget goes toward defense, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \u2014 a figure confirmed to us by Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nThe Peter G. Peterson Foundation puts the figure there, too, at 15%.\n\nAs for the dollars, the 2018 federal budget contained, according to a June 2019 report by the Congressional Budget Office:\n\u2022 $1.3 trillion went to discretionary spending, including $600 billion for defense. That would be about 46%.\n\u2022 Total outlays were $4.1 trillion, with defense getting $623 billion. That\u2019s 15%.\n\nThe 15% figure also holds true for 2019, as well.\n\nOmar said the U.S. spends \"57 cents on the dollar on defense.\"\n\nOverall, defense accounts for about 15% of the federal budget.\n\nHer figure is roughly in the ballpark when considering only discretionary federal spending, but she did not say that.", "lang": "en"}
