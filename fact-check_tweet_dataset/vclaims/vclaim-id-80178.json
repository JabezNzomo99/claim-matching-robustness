However there is no national policy on school uniforms, despite an increasing number of schools opting for more gender-neutral dress codes.\n\nAre British schoolboys being forced to wear \u201cgender-neutral\u201d skirts instead of shorts at school? That\u2019s what one popular online story by YourNewsWire claimed. Shared over five thousand times on Facebook, the story mixes elements from several news reports and comes as school uniforms are in the headlines in Britain with the rise of gender-neutral uniform policies amid anti-discrimination laws.\n\nBefore being taken out of context, the picture above originally featured in an article in The Guardian in June 2017 over a Devonshire academy\u2019s unwillingness to drop a trousers-only policy for boys despite a heatwave at the time. The photo of eight boys in tartan skirts formed part of the highly-publicised \u201cbox-pleat rebellion\u201d, when boys wore skirts to protest the ban on shorts.\n\nThe text from YourNewsWire picked up elements of a story about another school, Chiltern Edge Secondary School in Oxfordshire, which last year decided to no longer allow boys to wear shorts to school, leaving only trousers or skirts for pupils to choose from.\n\nThe school said on its website that it had \"made the decision to move to a more formal uniform. This has been successful. Shorts are not part of our uniform.\"\n\nThe false story claimed that Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education, had rated the uniform policy as \u201cinadequate\u201d.\n\nAlthough the decision came after an Ofsted report which rated the school as \u201cinadequate\u201d, the body has no authority over school policies and does not take uniforms into account during its inspections.\n\nHeadteacher Moira Green announced the new uniform policy in September 2017 \u201cwith the support of parents\u201d, in an effort to improve the school and remove special measures.\n\nIssues with strict uniform policies make the headlines around the end of the summer term in the UK, when students often prefer to wear shorts or other warm-weather clothing.\n\nThis year, a 16-year-old Welsh student Louis Fice, was sent home for wearing a skirt because of the warm weather. He had previously been reprimanded for wearing shorts without the permission of the headmaster, the only school figure who can allow the exception.\n\nThe Sunday Times this month reported that at least 40 secondary schools had stopped girls from wearing skirts after changing to trousers-only policies.\n\nCurrently, schools are free to dictate their own uniform policy, though they must be as anti-discriminatory as possible.\n\nLGBT lobby group Educate & Celebrate, which is run by \u201cexperienced teachers and youth workers\u201d, says its campaign to encourage schools to become more gender-neutral, both in their uniform and bathroom policies, has been successful, with scores of schools signed up.\n\nThe government is currently considering changes made to the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) which would clarify the rights of transgender people.\n\nFor now, there is no national policy on school uniforms, but an increasing number of schools are choosing to make their uniform policies more accessible to all.", "lang": "en"}
