But according to a viral video that circulated on social media in January 2020, a street in Spain was filled with this spongy substance after a major storm.\n\nThe following clip received millions of views after it was posted to Imgur with the caption: \u201cSea foam fills the streets of Spain after a storm hits the country.\u201d\n\nWhile this footage may look as if it comes from the pages of a fantasy novel, this is genuine video of a street in Spain filled with sea foam after a major storm.\n\nThe BBC reported that storm Gloria pummeled the Catalan coast with rain, snow, and hail in January 2020. The powerful storm left many people dead and thousands without power.\n\nStorm Gloria began wreaking havoc on Monday and five people have died. The storm has wrecked beach facilities, blocked roads and caused power cuts. Seawater has caused major damage to beaches around Barcelona, Valencia and on the Balearic Islands.\n\nThe powerful storm also produced a mass of sea foam that covered buildings and streets in Tossa de Mar, a town in Catalonia, Spain.\n\nThe viral video clip shown above was originally posted by Joan Jordana. Here\u2019s the original clip:\n\nThe Telegraph featured Jordana\u2019s footage in its video report about the storm:\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration explains that sea foam forms \u201cwhen dissolved organic matter in the ocean is churned up.\u201d\n\nIf you scoop up some water from the ocean in a clear glass and look at it closely, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s chock full of tiny particles. Seawater contains dissolved salts, proteins, fats, dead algae, detergents and other pollutants, and a bunch of other bits and pieces of organic and artificial matter. If you shake this glass of ocean water vigorously, small bubbles will form on the surface of the liquid. Sea foam forms in this way \u2013 but on a much grander scale \u2013 when the ocean is agitated by wind and waves.\n\nWhile the scene shown above is certainly unusual, it isn\u2019t unprecedented. In 2013, for instance, waves of sea foam invaded coastal towns in Australia:", "lang": "en"}
