Some of the links also suggest that pubs would reopen tomorrow, or that McDonald's restaurants would reopen tonight.\n\nNone of this is correct. Clicking these links takes you to a \u2018prank generator\u2019 website, where users can create links to apparently real stories which, when clicked on, are shown to be pranks.\n\nThe lockdown will apply to the UK until at least three weeks after 23 March, when the government has said it will review the rules. The lockdown could also last beyond that date.\n\nPubs remain closed under the most recent guidelines and after closing all its UK restaurants on 23 March, McDonalds has not said it is reopening them.\n\nSchools are mostly closed, although schools and all childcare providers have been asked to provide care for vulnerable children, and those whose parents are critical to the Covid-19 response. This has been the case since Monday 23 March and is unlikely to end soon.", "lang": "en"}
