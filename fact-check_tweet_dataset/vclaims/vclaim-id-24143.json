Members of the erstwhile Janata Party quit, as its members were barred from holding dual membership, mainly of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).\n\nThe Bharatiya Jana Sangh - precursor to the BJP, was a political outfit formed by Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, which later merged into the Janata Party.\n\nThe Janata Party was formed as a coalition of opponents of the Congress (I) under Indira Gandhi, of which the Jana Sangh was a constituent.\n\nThe Janata Party defeated the Congress (I) under Gandhi in 1977 to form the first non-Congress government in India since independence.\n\nIn the general elections held in 1984 after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, BJP got only two seats, which is the party's poorest show in the lower house of parliament.\n\nClaim: Indira Gandhi made two of her MPs resign for Vajpayee and Advani?\n\nBOOM looked at the period from 1962 when Indira Gandhi became the prime minister of India until her assassination on October 31, 1984 and Vajpayee and Advani's electoral runs during the corresponding period.\n\nDuring Indira Gandhi's first and second tenure in 1962 and 1967, Advani was the assistant editor at 'Organiser', a political journal of the Jana Sangh party.\n\nAdvani was also a Rajya Sabha member from 1970 to 1994 and did not contest the Lok Sabha elections during this period.\n\nBOOM also spoke to Ramchandra Guha, historian and author of 'India After Gandhi' and 'India Before Gandhi'.\n\n\"Advani and Vajpayee had very frosty relations with Indira Gandhi. The only time the relations would have been okay was during the 1971 India-Pakistan War when everyone came together. By the late 70s the relation was very cold and hostile as Indira Gandhi as she had put Advani and Vajpayee in jail during the Emergency (1975-1977) imposed by Indira Gandhi,\" added Guha.\n\nIndira Gandhi had lost 1977 elections to the Janata Party and came back to power in the 1980 general election. Meanwhile Vajpayee's fate was some what opposite, he won the 1977 election and was made minister for external affairs in the Janata Party government.\n\nHe again won his seat in the 1980 general election from Lucknow.\n\nThe only Lok Sabha election that Vajpayee lost was in 1984 when he contested from Gwalior and lost to Madhavrao Scindia, following the death of Indira Gandhi.", "lang": "en"}
