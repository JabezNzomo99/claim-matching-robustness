This claim is partly false. Some areas are wrongly listed in the top 10; in reality the Labour Party does not have political control of three of the local councils for the top 10 areas with the highest rates of COVID-19.\n\nThe posts ( here , here , here , here ) say: \u201cTop 10 areas with highest Coronavirus spikes: Blackburn - Labour, Leicester - Labour, Rochdale - Labour, Bradford - Labour, Luton - Labour, Kirklees - Labour, Rotherham - Labour, Sandwell - Labour, Calderdale - Labour, Wakefield - Labour. Can anybody spot a connection?\u201d\n\nAccording to Public Health England\u2019s latest weekly coronavirus report ( tinyurl.com/yy7lj35o ), which is the one published closest to the date of the claim, the 10 areas with the highest weekly incidence of coronavirus per 100,000 population are Blackburn with Darwen, Leicester, Oldham, Bradford, Hyndburn (Lancashire), Rochdale, Pendle (Lancashire), Oadby and Wigston (Leicestershire), Trafford and Eden (Cumbria). Therefore six of the places listed in the social media posts (Luton, Kirklees, Rotherham, Sandwell, Calderdale and Wakefield) are not in the latest top 10.\n\nIt is not clear whether the post is referring to local councils or members of parliament when it describes the various locations as Labour.\n\nIt is true that the Labour Party has political control of all of the councils listed in the post ( here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here ).\n\nHowever, of the 10 areas on the official list of places with the highest weekly incidence of coronavirus, three councils are not Labour-run: the Conservative party has the largest number of seats on Pendle Borough Council and Eden District Council ( here , here ), and the Liberal Democrats have a majority in Oadby and Wigston ( here ). The remaining seven councils are Labour-run (Blackburn with Darwen, Leicester, Oldham, Bradford, Hyndburn, Rochdale and Trafford) ( here , here , here ).\n\nIf the social media post is referring to MPs, it should be noted that some of the areas listed cover more than one constituency. The constituencies covered by the areas listed in the post are not entirely Labour-run: the MP for Wakefield is from the Conservative party ( here ) and Kirklees, Sandwell and Calderdale have a mix of Conservative and Labour MPs across their constituencies ( here , here , here ).\n\nThe remaining six places listed (Blackburn, Rochdale, Rotherham, Leicester, Bradford and Luton) have entirely Labour MPs ( here , here , here , here , here , here ).\n\nIn Public Health England\u2019s list of the 10 areas with the highest weekly incidence of coronavirus four have Labour MPs (Leicester, Oldham, Bradford and Rochdale) ( here , here , here , here ) and four have Conservatives (Hyndburn, Pendle, Oadby and Wigston, and Eden) ( here , here , www.neilobrien.org.uk/ , here ). The remaining two areas (Blackburn with Darwen and Trafford) have two Conservative and three Labour MPs between them ( here , here ).\n\nParty false. Only four of the areas listed in the social media post are among the top 10 coronavirus hotspots in the UK; most but not all of the areas in the actual top 10 are run by Labour-majority councils.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
