But it did change the target.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19973", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/ask-full-fact-have-conservatives-redefined-child-poverty/", "vclaim": "Ask Full Fact: have the Conservatives redefined child poverty?\n\nOn 16 May we wrote an article saying that there has been no significant change in the level of child poverty under the Conservatives, based on official data.\n\nSome people asked whether this took account of government changes to the definition of poverty.\n\n\n\nThese comments are on to something. The government has started to use a different set of measures to set targets for reducing child poverty. But they haven\u2019t changed the definition of poverty used in the official data.\n\nWe weren\u2019t talking about those new measures in our article. We were using the measures of poverty which the original targets were based on.\n\nIf the government tried to claim that \u201cchild poverty is down\u201d by comparing the original targets to the new ones, we\u2019d be the first to point it out.\n\nThe government has switched its child poverty targets to a different measure\n\nThere have been a number of headlines in recent years about government plans to \u201credefine child poverty\u201d.\n\nThere certainly has been a shift in the focus of government targets.\n\nThe Child Poverty Act 2010 set targets for the government to reduce child poverty, measured using two financial measures of poverty. In the statistics, \u2018relative poverty\u2019 is defined as a household earning less than 60% of the median income and \u2018absolute poverty\u2019 as earning less than 60% of the median income in 2010/11 (adjusted for inflation).\n\nIn 2016 those targets were scrapped and replaced with a duty to monitor and report on the number of children living in \u201cworkless households\u201d and the educational performance of \u201cdisadvantaged children\u201d.\n\nBut the statistics on relative and absolute child poverty weren\u2019t scrapped.\n\nThe House of Lords pushed the government to keep a requirement to publish these figures in the legislation, even if the targets based on them were abandoned. It eventually agreed. So the Work and Pensions Secretary is obliged by the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 to publish child poverty data based on the original financial measures.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions said at the time that \u201cwe\u2019ve always been very clear that we will continue to publish low-income statistics\u201d, whether legally obliged to or not.\n\nWe compare how poverty has changed on the original measures\n\nThe upshot is that figures on relative and absolute child poverty have been published consistently since 2002, and are still available.\n\nDespite some small methodological changes, they\u2019re a consistent benchmark.\n\nThe changes include updating the figures to use the new measure of inflation recommended by the National Statistician.\n\nSome people have criticised switching the targets to new measures of poverty\n\nThe decision to switch targets reflected Conservative doubts about whether purely financial measures of poverty were useful.\n\nIt\u2019s been argued that creating those new criteria on \u201cworkless households\u201d and \u201cdisadvantaged children\u201d alongside the more familiar financial measure of poverty will muddy the waters. Prospect magazine editor Tom Clark has written that:\n\n\u201cThe purpose is to cloud accountability\u2014to create so many indicators that there is bound to be some nugget or other of good news to point to, even in a land where the poor are getting very much poorer. The objective is to whip up confusion in place of clarity.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s possible. But it\u2019s very different to the situation our readers were talking about: that the government has meddled with the existing measures in a way that means fewer children are captured as being \u201cin poverty\u201d. Again: those absolute and relative poverty figures are consistent over time.", "lang": "en"}
