Nevertheless, that meant 58 senators signaled they would vote against the Iran deal.\n\nThe statement is carefully crafted. The president refers to senators studying the details of the deal and coming out in support, as opposed to reflexive opposition. For many weeks, the key question in Washington was whether Obama would win enough support to sustain a veto of the resolution, so the fact that he secured enough votes to block a final vote was a bit of a surprise.\n\nOn the face of it, support by 42 members of the Senate out of 100 indicates minority support. When the Senate blocked a final vote on enhanced background checks for gun purchases with a vote of 54 to 46, the president made a statement decrying the actions of a \u201cminority\u201d:\n\nStill, the president\u2019s statement, as framed, appears to suggest the \u201cstrong support\u201d refers to the number of Democrats in the Senate who decided to support the deal in the final days, thus thwarting an actual vote on the resolution. But does the same hold true for U.S. citizens?\n\nObviously, various polls indicated a range of opinions on the Iran deal, and our colleague Scott Clement noted that the polling results often depended on the types of questions asked, with some polls offering simple yes-or-no questions and others describing the deal in detail before asking the question.\n\nSo because the president appears to be claiming strong support based on the surge of support by lawmakers at the end of the process, let\u2019s see what happened to public support as the debate unfolded. We\u2019ve focused on reputable polls that asked the same question at least twice over the summer so that we could get a feel for the trend line.\n\nAs you can see, support for the agreement consistently dropped over the summer, even as the White House was picking up enough votes from Democratic lawmakers to thwart a resolution nullifying the agreement. In large part, the shift is because the debate became hyper-partisan. As Republican lawmakers unified in opposition, sentiment among Republican voters also turned against the deal.\n\nBut the polls also reflect declining support among Democrats. By the beginning of September, there was barely a poll that, outside the margin of error, indicated majority support for the deal, let alone \u201cstrong\u201d support.\n\nThis was an unusual survey, in which respondents were given a briefing on the issue that included the main arguments for and against the agreement. This gives some credence to the White House suggestion that people who studied the agreement in depth tended to support it. But the survey also found sharply partisan attitudes, with Republican support plunging from previous surveys.\n\nUpdate: We had not originally included The Washington Post-ABC News poll because we did not have more than one data point. But on Sept. 16, a new poll was released that found a bare majority in support, but continued erosion, especially among Republicans, over the summer. Support fell even further than an alternative question, with less detail, was asked.\n\nAny way you slice it, it is difficult to support the claim that there is \u201cstrong support\u201d for the Iran deal among lawmakers and citizens. This is clearly a case of winning ugly, in the face of minority support among lawmakers and increasing opposition among American citizens.", "lang": "en"}
