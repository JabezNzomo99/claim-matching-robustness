A few seconds later, we see a group of people watching as bystanders. Subsequently, one of the shooters flees while the other takes a civilian a hostage. Four men enter the premises and shot down the gunman. No civilian was injured. After this another scenario is shown where a suicide bomber blows himself up and a gunman takes civilians as hostages. Men dressed in military gear enter and take down the gunman. The camera shows a civilian who appears to be injured and close up of a dislocated leg. The video ends with Channel News Asia\u2019s logo.\n\nOn March 21, Alt News debunked a clip of hostage-taking scenario at Blaise Diagne Airport in Dakar, Senegal which was viral on social media with a similar claim. Keeping this in mind and the fact that the video ended with the logo of Channel Asia News, we performed a keyword search on YouTube and found the viral video.\n\nIt was uploaded by Channel News Asia on October 17, 2019. The context of the viral video is in the description. The video shows a counterterrorism exercise conducted at Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport, Terminal 3.\n\nTherefore, the social media claim associated with the viral video is false and misleading. The video is not from China nor it is related to coronavirus. It represents counterterrorism exercise at Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport from 2017.", "lang": "en"}
