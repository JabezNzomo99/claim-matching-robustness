And, please, follow theorfor guidance on protecting your community from the disease.\n\nIn late July 2020, Snopes readers began inquiring about news reports that a person killed in a motorcycle crash had been listed as a COVID-19 death in Florida.\n\nFlorida was among states experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases amid the ongoing pandemic, but political leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Trump supporters such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis were criticized for downplaying the virus.\n\nDuring a press conference July 20, DeSantis pointed to the case of the motorcyclist, saying:\n\nThe other thing I\u2019ve asked the Department of Health to look at is there was a case here in Central Florida where somebody, I think they were in their twenties, and they were in a motorcycle accident, and that was counted as a coronavirus death. And a lot of people are like, \u201cHow is that possible? You get hit by a car and then you\u2019re attributing it to coronavirus?\u201d And so I want them to go back and look. I think though, the reason that\u2019s the case is because what [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] has said is anybody that tests positive, if they then die, that\u2019s a death amongst cases.\n\nContrary to what DeSantis stated, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance doesn\u2019t direct caregivers to list all deaths as COVID-19 deaths simply because the disease was detected in the decedent. Instead, it instructs caregivers to list various factors contributing to death in appropriate sections of death certificates. In other words, it does not state that anyone who suffers an unnatural death such as a traffic accident should be listed as a COVID-19-caused death if they also happen to test positive, even if the disease didn\u2019t cause to their death.\n\nIt does appear to the case, however, that a motorcyclist who was killed in a traffic accident also tested positive for COVID-19, and was initially listed among Florida\u2019s COVID-19-related deaths. But officials from the Florida Department of Health said that person has since been removed from the count.\n\nThe story about the motorcyclist was initially reported by WOFL, an Orlando-based TV news station, which learned the information in a phone conversation with Orange County Health Officer Dr. Raul Pino. In the July 17 article, WOFL reported:\n\nA person who died in a motorcycle accident was added to Florida\u2019s COVID-19 death count, according to a state health official. FOX 35 News found this out after asking Orange County Health Officer Dr. Raul Pino whether two coronavirus victims who were in their 20s had any underlying conditions. One of his answers surprised us. \u201cThe first one didn\u2019t have any. He died in a motorcycle accident,\u201d Pino said. Dr. Pino was asked if the man\u2019s data was removed. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I have to double-check,\u201d Pino said. \u201cWe were arguing, discussing, or trying to argue with the state. Not because of the numbers \u2014 it\u2019s 100\u2026it doesn\u2019t make any difference if it\u2019s 99 \u2014 but the fact that the individual didn\u2019t die from COVID-19\u2026died in the crash. But you could actually argue that it could have been the COVID-19 that caused him to crash. I don\u2019t know the conclusion of that one.\u201d\n\nWOFL updated the story two days later to indicate that the motorcyclist death had been removed from the COVID-19 death tally. Kent Donahue, a spokesman for Pino\u2019s office, confirmed that to be the case in a phone interview with Snopes. We therefore list this claim as \u201cOutdated.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
