The treatment is to be administered for a maximum of 14 days and the results of which were expected in July.\n\nThe pharmaceutical developed its own Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and its formulation through its in-house Research and Development Team in India.

This trial is called the Favipiravir and Umifenovir Trial in Indian Hospital Setting (FAITH) Trial.\n\nFavipiravir, an antiviral drug is sold under the brand name Avigan in Japan. It has earlier been used against Ebola. The antiviral stops the virus from replicating in the body, and in turn reducing the amount of the virus making it non-infectious.\n\nThe drug has been approved in Italy, Japan, China, and Russia for treating COVID-19.\n\nIn two clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen, this drug was seen to act against SARS-CoV-2 while in February, director of China's National Centre for Biotechnological Development recommended the use of this anti-viral.\n\nThe Japanese study, however, started to use Favipiravir on compassionate grounds and only provided it to hospitals that participated in the observational study after seeking an informed consent by the patients.\n\nCurrently, the World Health Organization (WHO) is conducting the Solidarity Trial for checking the efficiency of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, remdesivir, and plasma therapy against COVID-19. The WHO stopped the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) trial after a study by Oxford University showed that HCQ had no effect on SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThis Oxford study called the RECOVERY Trial also found that a low-costing c orticosteroid, Dexamethasone was found to reduce COVID-19 deaths by one/third and one/fifth in ventilated and oxygenated patients respectively.\n\nAlso Read: Dexamethasone- Steroid For Treating COVID-19: All You Need To Know\n\nIndia has been actively following the plasma therapy at selected hospitals while also using a combination of drugs to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nAlso Read: Plasma Therapy For COVID-19: All You Need To Know", "lang": "en"}
