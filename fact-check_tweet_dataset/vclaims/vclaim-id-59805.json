{"title": "Has Aldi Stopped Requiring Customers to Wear Masks?", "subtitle": "No.", "author": "factcheck.thedispatch.com", "date": "2020-07-29T17:11:40+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-59805", "url": "https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/has-aldi-stopped-requiring-customers", "vclaim": "A viral Facebook post claiming to feature a message from Aldi stated that the grocery store chain will not enforce a face mask requirement:\n\nContrary to what \u201cGefferson\u201d said in the alleged message, Aldi does require face masks to enter the store. In a statement released on July 17, it was announced that \u201ceffective July 27, face coverings will be required to enter ALDI stores.\u201d The logic of this decision runs counter to what is claimed in the Facebook post\u2014because asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and mildly symptomatic coronavirus carriers can still spread the virus, it\u2019s possible for people who have the virus to spread it without realizing they\u2019re even contagious.\n\nThere is abundant evidence that masks lower the risk of those who already have the virus spreading it to others, and there is emerging evidence that they may help protect mask wearers themselves by reducing the number of virus particles they take in. So, people who don\u2019t wear masks are not only increasing the risk that they could spread the virus to others, if they\u2019re infected, they may well be raising their own risks of catching it. Aldi\u2019s July 17 statement further notes: \u201cWe encourage any customer that is unable or unwilling to wear a face covering, to visit shop.aldi.us for grocery delivery - and even Curbside Grocery Pickup in many locations.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Dispatch Fact Check, an Aldi representative said of the Facebook post: \u201cWe can confirm the response in question that is circulating on social media is not authentic and did not come from a representative for ALDI U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on guidance from national health organizations like the CDC, we require all customers to wear face coverings while shopping in an ALDI store as of July 27. Our priority will always be the well-being of our customers and employees. Requiring face coverings in stores is one way we can keep our stores and the communities we serve safe. We will provide complimentary disposable face coverings to any customer who needs one.\u201d\n\nWhile the Facebook post does correctly note that Aldi\u2019s policy on face masks shows common sense and a love for humanity, the store\u2019s stance on the matter is the exact opposite of what is claimed in the post: Wear a mask in the store, and if you don\u2019t want to then seek alternatives that don\u2019t potentially endanger others.", "lang": "en"}
