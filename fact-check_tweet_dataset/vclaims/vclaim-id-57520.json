According to the report, the police informed that a woman committed suicide by jumping from the roof of Hotel Valencia Center on December 24, 2019. The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Spain on January 31, 2020. The report states that the claims related to coronavirus are baseless.\n\nThe incident was also fact-checked by Spanish website Newtral. \u201cThe National Police of Valencia has confirmed to Newtral.es that the images of this event were recorded in 2019 and that they are not related to the coronavirus,\u201d reads its article.\n\nThus, the social media claim associated with the viral video is false. Earlier, a 2015 video of a Ghanian woman jumping off a building was shared as a man committed suicide in the US after testing positive for coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
