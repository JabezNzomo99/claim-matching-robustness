Barr did say he believed he was sticking up for the rule of law \u2014 and he said it immediately after the clip Todd presented was cut off.\n\n\"Meet the Press\" acknowledged the error in response to criticism from Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec on Twitter. NBC News declined to comment further, and Todd did not respond to a separate request for comment.\n\n\"Earlier today, we inadvertently and inaccurately cut short a video clip of an interview with AG Barr before offering commentary and analysis,\" the show said in a tweet. \"The remaining clip included important remarks from the attorney general that we missed, and we regret the error.\"\n\nThe discrepancy between Todd\u2019s description of the clip he showed and Barr\u2019s complete remarks drew backlash on Twitter from conservative pundits and politicians. President Donald Trump retweeted several criticisms and called more than once for the \"Meet the Press\" host to be fired, tagging the Federal Communications Commission and its chairman, Ajit Pai.\n\n\"Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd should be FIRED by \"Concast\" (NBC) for this fraud,\" Trump said in one tweet, using his pejorative nicknames for Todd and Comcast, NBC\u2019s parent company. \"He knew exactly what he was doing.\"\n\nThe clip from Barr\u2019s interview was shown as part of a question during a panel discussion about the Flynn case. Todd teed up his question for Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan after NBC News reporter Kristen Welker, another panelist, mentioned the attorney general.\n\n\"I want you to listen to this Bill Barr answer to a question about what will history say about this,\" Todd said. \"Wait until you hear this answer. Take a listen.\"\n\nThe tape rolled, showing Herridge asking Barr what the impression will be \"when history looks back on this decision\" to recommend the dismissal of Flynn\u2019s charges.\n\n\"Well, history is written by the winners,\" Barr said in response. \"So it largely depends on who\u2019s writing the history.\"\n\nAt that point, Todd said he was struck \"by the cynicism\" of Barr\u2019s answer. \"It's a correct answer,\" he said. \"But he's the attorney general. He didn't make the case that he was upholding the rule of law. He was almost admitting that, yeah, this is a political job.\"\n\nBut had the tape kept rolling, viewers would have seen that Barr did insist that he was upholding the rule of law. In fact, he used those exact words. Here\u2019s his full quote, with the relevant portion in bold:\n\n\"Well, history is written by the winners. So it largely depends on who's writing the history. But I think a fair history would say it was a good decision because it upheld the rule of law, it upheld the standards of the Department of Justice, and it undid what was an injustice.\"\n\nKupec said on Twitter that Barr made similar points elsewhere in the interview. For example, when asked if he was doing Trump\u2019s bidding by altering the course of the Flynn case, Barr said, \"No, I\u2019m doing the law\u2019s bidding. I\u2019m doing my duty under the law, as I see it.\"\n\nFor its part, \"CBS Evening News\" also trimmed the clip of Barr in the same fashion during its May 7 TV broadcast, cutting his quote after \"winners.\" Norah O\u2019Donnell, the show\u2019s anchor, didn\u2019t claim that Barr never said he was upholding the law, as Todd did.\n\n\"CBS This Morning\" presented the clip in its full context May 8.\n\nTodd said Barr \"didn\u2019t make the case that he was upholding the rule of law\" with regard to Flynn during an interview with CBS News.\n\n\"Meet the Press\" did not show the attorney general\u2019s complete remarks.\n\nAfter saying that \"history is written by the winners,\" Barr said, \"I think a fair history would say it was a good decision because it upheld the rule of law.\"\n\nUPDATE, May 13, 2020: Todd apologized for the error during the May 12 edition of MSNBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press Daily.\"\n\nTodd said his team did not deliberately omit Barr\u2019s complete remarks or edit them out. They saw only the \"CBS Evening News\" version of the clip, and they did not check for a full transcript, he said.\n\n\"The second part of the attorney general\u2019s answer would have put it in the proper context, and had I seen that part of the interview, I would not have framed the conversation the way I did, and I obviously am very sorry for that mistake,\" Todd said.", "lang": "en"}
