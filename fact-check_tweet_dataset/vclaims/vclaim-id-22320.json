So the \u00a32 million figure quoted in the Mirror seems in the right ballpark.\n\nIn 2018, the Press Association reported that policing costs for the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton were \u00a36.35 million, including \u00a32.8 million for police overtime. The wedding was held in London, and declared a Bank Holiday\u2014meaning some officers were paid double\u2014which may explain the higher cost. The figures were obtained through Freedom of Information (FoI) requests which we have not seen. An earlier FoI from the Metropolitan Police estimated the police operation cost \u00a37.2 million.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police reportedly said that \u00a33.6 million was granted by the Home Office for \u201cadditional costs\u201d of policing the 2011 Royal wedding.\n\nPolice and Crime Commissioners are allowed to apply to the Home Office for this additional special grant funding to cover additional costs of \u201cexceptional events\u201d that are above 1% of their annual budget. Thames Valley Police\u2019s budget in 2018/19 is around \u00a3390 million.\n\nSo, for example, if the force made an application for \u00a35 million to cover additional costs, generally, the force would be expected to pay the first 1% (around \u00a33.9m) with a special Home Office grant providing the balance (in this example a special grant of \u00a31.1 million).\n\nWe've asked the Home Office whether the government will be paying for anything directly for this year's Royal wedding or whether Thames Valley Police have applied for special grants for their role in policing both Royal weddings this year. We haven\u2019t yet received a reply.", "lang": "en"}
