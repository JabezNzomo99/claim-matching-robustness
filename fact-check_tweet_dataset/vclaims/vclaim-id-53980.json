Once you have shared and liked our page simply comment that you have completed and we will send your box within the next 24 hours! Participants Must Like Our Page!\n\nHopefully the 200,000 or so commenters who participated aren\u2019t holding their breath, because we don\u2019t expect that box will arrive anytime soon.\n\nA few red flags we noticed right away:\n\u2022 This is an unverified Facebook page (on verified Facebook pages for well-known brands or public figures, you should see a little blue check mark next to their name). The page was created on Jan. 3, 2020, and has no other posts except the one listed above. Seems odd that such an established brand like Disney World would make its Facebook debut this year.\n\u2022 The verified Walt Disney World Facebook page is not making the same offer. Instead, it is focused on, fittingly, communicating information pertaining to the park\u2019s closure in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022 It\u2019s not totally clear what the photograph shows, but the boxes in the photograph promote the website runDisney.com, which promotes marathon races held at Disney parks. No information about this \u201cbox\u201d giveaway appeared on that website, the Disney Park blog, the Disney World website, or other Disney sites we searched.\n\u2022 Disney World opened in 1971. So unless the giveaway is for tickets for a few decades in the future, it\u2019s unclear why this offer is celebrating the park\u2019s \u201c78th birthday.\u201d\n\nFinally, we\u2019re not sure what a \u201cDisney World Holiday Box\u201d is, but it seems odd to mail out a box in order to deliver an ultimately intangible reward of a vacation.", "lang": "en"}
