But the maximum sentence is the same across the board, whereas assaults on all public sector workers are treated more seriously when it comes to sentencing.\n\nA common assault is when \u201ca person intentionally or recklessly causes another [person] to apprehend the immediate infliction of unlawful force\u201d, or actually \u201capplies\u201d that force, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\n\nThe maximum sentence for a common assault is six months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nAn assault on a \u201cconstable in the execution of his duty\u201d is a separate criminal offence, but it also carries a six-month maximum sentence. The same goes for assaults on prison and immigration officers.\n\nThere\u2019s no separate offence of assaulting an NHS worker. But it\u2019s not clear that having one would make a big difference.\n\nSentencing guidelines for assault already say that if the victim is a public sector worker, that\u2019s an \u201caggravating factor\u201d when it comes to sentencing. Jail time is the \u201cstarting point\u201d for an assault on a public servant, according to the CPS.\n\nThis may well make the actual sentences handed out similar for both police officers and NHS workers, but there\u2019s no quick way to tell from the official statistics. This is for two reasons.\n\nFirst, sentencing figures for assault on a constable are bundled in with the less serious crime of \u201cresisting or obstructing\u201d a constable. (There\u2019s a version of this lesser crime for emergency workers, like paramedics.) Second, there aren\u2019t figures for common assaults committed against public sector workers specifically.\n\nSo we can\u2019t make an easy comparison that would tell us whether those assaulting NHS workers get off more lightly, in practice, than those assaulting the police.", "lang": "en"}
