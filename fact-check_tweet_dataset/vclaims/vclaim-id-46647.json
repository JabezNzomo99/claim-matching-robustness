The claim is false; the images are a mix of old stock photos and pictures taken from unrelated Vietnamese-language media reports; Malaysia halted pork imports from Vietnam in January 2019.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts, including this post published on March 13, 2019. It has been shared more than 200 times. It shows a series of photos of meats, dead pig, and a man and woman in hospital, alongside a text image that claims infected pork from Vietnam has arrived in Malaysia.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201cThe Vietnamese pork virus has arrived in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Don't eat barbecue pork and buy raw pork. Remember, remember to pay more attention to the virus pork and the imported Malaysian A8 brand suckling pig and C1 brand suckling pig! !\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same photos were shared in this Facebook post with a similar claim.\n\nThe same images were posted here on Facebook on June 13, 2019, alongside a similar claim, but the photos were subsequently deleted from the post.\n\nThe claim is false; Malaysia halted pork imports from Vietnam in January 2019.\n\nMalaysian authorities have said here that Malaysia has not imported any live pig or pork products from Vietnam since January 23, 2019.\n\nTranslated to English, the Department of the Veterinary Services\u2019 notice reads: \u201cThe Department of Veterinary Services. Following the outbreak of the African Swine Fever, the Department of Veterinary Services have made restrictions for the importation of live pigs and pig products (including canned products) from a few countries.\u201d\n\nIt also lists details of the restrictions:\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the document:\n\nThe images in the misleading posts also do not show infected pork in Malaysia in 2019.\n\nThe first picture of the two men looking over and taking pictures of the dead pig was previously shared in this October 1, 2015 , Vietnamese-language media report from Thai Nguyen Online.

This January 9, 2018, post on Facebook shared the photos of the man and the woman.\n\nThe first two sentences of the lengthy Vietnamese-language caption reads: \u201cUrgent, we need to share this post urgently. There are two people infected in Ha Giang area.\u201d\n\nThe post says that the two people fell sick after eating pig blood at a house-warming ceremony on Tuesday, January 2, 2018, and the man had been diagnosed with streptococcus infection.\n\nThis YouTube video of Ha Giang TV, dated January 18, 2018, shows the same man on a hospital bed.
