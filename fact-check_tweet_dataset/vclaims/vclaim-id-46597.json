The claim is false; the video previously circulated in media reports in 2018 about a Hindu woman in northern India being flogged by her husband for allegedly having an affair; a police official told AFP in July 2019 that the woman was a Hindu and the case had been \"resolved\".\n\nThe video was published here in a Facebook posts on June 1, 2019, and has been viewed over 26,000 times since.\n\nA caption alongside the video in English says: \u201cMuslim women is beaten publicly in India by Hindutva (BJP +RSS).\u201d\n\nHindutva refers to the pro-Hindu politics allegedly propagated by India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).\n\nIn the 51-second video, a woman is seen with her hands tied by rope to a tree, being repeatedly beaten by a man. The couple is encircled by a crowd of spectators.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same video has been shared elsewhere on Facebook here, here and here, alongside a different claim - that the woman is being beaten for \u201ccarrying meat\u201d.\n\nThe caption on these Facebook posts reads: \u201cModi's Hindu India crimes against a Muslim women carrying meat, this is the worst kind of human rights violation in the world, but whole world media is sleeping fast on these Indian human violations!\u201d\n\nSeveral people in India have been killed or assaulted on suspicion of carrying beef or transporting cows for slaughter in the last five years, as explained in this AFP report.\n\nBut both of the claims are false; the video previously circulated in media reports in 2018 about a woman in northern India being flogged by her husband for allegedly having an affair, after a decision by the village council.\n\nA Google search found the same footage in this video report on the official YouTube channel for Indian news site NYOOOZ TV.\n\n\u201cIn a shocking incident, a village panchayat in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Bulandshahr gave a cruel order to punish a woman who allegedly eloped with a man. In a viral video, the woman was tied to a tree and flogged in public by her husband,\u201d reads the description of the video shown below and published on March 22, 2019.\n\nA panchayat is a local council common in rural parts of India, as explained in this AFP article.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video report:\n\nAccording to this video report, the incident took place in the Bulandshahr district of the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh on march 10, 2018.\n\nBulandshahr Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Dhan Prakash Tyagi told AFP by phone on July 4, 2019, the \u201cwoman seen in the video is not Muslim. We cannot reveal her identity but she is Hindu and belongs to the Lodhi Rajput community. The case is resolved and both husband and wife are living together now in their village\".\n\nIndian news channel NDTV published this video report of the incident on its site on March 23, 2018, which contains the following comments from a police official.\n\n\u201cWe took action as soon as the video came to our notice. We called the woman and registered her complaint under the relevant section of the Indian Penal Code. The complaint has been filed against six people, including former chief of the village council who convened the village council\u2019s meeting and her husband who flogged her,\u201d said Bulandshahr\u2019s then Superintendent of Police (SP), Pravin Ranjan Singh, in the video report.\n\n\u201cWe have also registered a complaint against 20-22 other unknown people in the case and arrested three people, including the husband, village council chief and his son,\u201d he added.\n\nBelow is an image comparing screenshots of the video published in the misleading Facebook post (L), NYOOZ TV report published on YouTube (M) and NDTV report (R):\n\nThe incident was also reported on the websites of the two English-language dailies - Hindustan Times and The Hindu - here and here respectively.", "lang": "en"}
