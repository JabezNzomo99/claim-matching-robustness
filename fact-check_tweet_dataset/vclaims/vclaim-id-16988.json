Ron Johnson, who is trailing but gaining on Democratic challenger Russ Feingold in the latest poll, announced April 29, 2016 he is launching a tour of Wisconsin as part of his re-election campaign.\n\nA routine notice. Until this line in his news release:\n\n\"Ron\u2019s statewide tour will include stops at Pacur, the Oshkosh plastics manufacturing company he started in 1979.\"\n\n\n\n The statement suggests the company was started only by Johnson, or at least that he was main person who launched it.\n\nBut that seems to contradict the established history of Pacur (pronounced liked packer), and is in conflict with some of Johnson\u2019s own statements.\n\nIt\u2019s long been widely reported that Johnson was there at the beginning of Pacur.\n\nBut with analysts saying he is among the most vulnerable Senate incumbents in the November 2016 elections, did Johnson\u2019s campaign overstate his role in starting the company?\n\nAfter all, the name Pacur comes from Pat Curler -- Johnson\u2019s brother-in-law.\n\nQuestions first arose when Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigative columnist Daniel Bice reported that Johnson had rewritten his own company history on Aug. 25, 2010.\n\nThat was less than three weeks before the GOP primary and about 10 weeks before Johnson upset Feingold, an 18-year incumbent, in the 2010 Senate election.\n\nFor nearly nine years, Bice wrote, Pacur carried this online description of its beginning:\n\n \n\n Founded in 1977, Pacur occupies a facility constructed specifically for sheet extrusion, which provides polyester and polypropylene sheet and rollstock to converters, distributors, and end users.\n\nThe revised description, now carrying an asterisk, said the founding occurred two years later, in 1979.\n\nThe asterisk pointed out that Pacur had a predecessor -- Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies -- that came into existence in 1977 before it was renamed and restructured in 1979.\n\nIn other words, Pacur grew out of an existing company, Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies.\n\nThat company was owned by Curler, the brother of Johnson\u2019s wife.\n\nJohnson\u2019s own statements haven't always been as credit-taking as the line in the news release.\n\nSome examples from the 2010 campaign:\n\u2022 The Journal Sentinel reported that Johnson said he began working as Pacur's accountant and co-founder in July or August of 1979. The article stated that both companies were led by Curler, and that Curler was Johnson's initial boss.\n\u2022 Pacur \"was an opportunity for (Curler) to get into business for himself, and I just kind of came along for the ride as the accountant,\" Johnson said in another Journal Sentinel article.\n\u2022 Johnson had been calling himself a co-founder of the company, but later acknowledged he joined several months after Pacur was established, the Associated Press reported. He started as a machine operator and accountant and eventually became its president, the article said.\n\nMore recent statements also reinforce the idea that Johnson, who bought Pacur in 1997, didn't start the company alone.\n\nJohnson\u2019s official Senate website says he started the company with Curler.\n\nSo did a tweet Johnson sent in in March 2016.\n\nDefending the statement in the press release, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us Johnson \"helped build Pacur into a great Wisconsin success story, and we've never said anything counter to how it all began.\"\n\nAnnouncing a statewide tour in his campaign for reelection, a Johnson news release said Johnson \"started\" the Pacur plastics manufacturing company he owns.\n\nThe claim contradicts Pacur\u2019s own company history and Johnson\u2019s prior statements, which make it clear he helped start Pacur with his brother-in-law, who was more involved in the founding. Johnson didn't do it alone. The news release doesn\u2019t indicate an attempt by Johnson to rewrite history, but he is responsible for his campaign statements, and this one left out important details.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but needs more information, we rate the claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
