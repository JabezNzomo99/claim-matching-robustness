The picture documents the remains of a canine posthumously named \u201cStuckie,\u201d which are currently on display at Southern Forest World, a museum in Georgia.\n\nIt is believed that Stuckie met his unfortunate fate sometime in the 1960s. The hunting dog (we\u2019re not entirely sure of its breed, but early reports identified it as a hound) was reportedly chasing an animal when it became trapped inside the hollow part of a tree. The dog perished there and remained entombed inside the tree for about 20 years, until it was cut down by loggers from the Georgia Kraft Corp. While we haven\u2019t been able to find any firsthand accounts of the discovery, it\u2019s reasonable to presume that the loggers indeed \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe what they found inside this hollow tree,\u201d as they decided it was worthy of preservation at the Southern Forest World museum.\n\nA 1985 article published in the Atlantic Constitution newspaper recounted the story of Stuckie and included comments from W.J. Martin, then the executive director at Southern Forest World, who explained that \u201ca chimney effect occurred in the hollow tree, which resulted in an upward draft of air \u2026 This caused the scent of the dead animal to be carried away so that insects and other organisms were not attracted to it\u201d:\n\nWhile Stuckie has been displayed at this Georgia museum since the 1980s, photographs of the preserved remains of the animal didn\u2019t reach viral levels on the internet until 2018. At that time, Newsweek spoke to Kristina Killgrove, a biological anthropologist at the University of West Florida who studies decay in humans, about how this dog became mummified in the center of a tree:\n\nNormally when a person or an animal dies, the microbes in the body are left unchecked by biological processes that keep them under control in living creatures. Without the usual guardians in place, they begin to eat the body, and then the microorganisms in the gut start the process of putrefaction. \u201cThey grow, they reproduce, and they start taking over the body,\u201d Killgrove told Newsweek. \u201cThat\u2019s the disgusting part.\u201d The body bloats and decays, and bacteria, fungi, insects and other animals come to eat the remains. But this isn\u2019t what happened with Stuckie in that chestnut oak that would become his coffin. Chestnut oaks contain tannin, which is used to tan animal pelts and prevent decay. Tannin is a natural \u201cdesiccant,\u201d or material that absorbs moisture and dries out its surroundings. The low-moisture environment stopped the microbial activity, Killgrove explained. And no microbial activity means no decay.\n\nReaders can get a closer look at Stuckie in the following video from the George Public Broadcasting show \u201cGeorgia Traveler\u201d:\n\nWe reached out to the Southern Forest World and will update this article if more information becomes available.", "lang": "en"}
