Scientific research supports their assertions.\n\nMore than 400 species of sharks live in the world\u2019s oceans, according to the Shark Research Institute. They all belong to the chondrichthyan classification, which includes other cartilaginous fish like skates, rays and chimaeras.\n\n\u201cSharks are the only animals that never get sick,\u201d one Facebook post claims. \u201cThey are even immune to every known disease including cancer.\u201d\n\nHowever, peer-reviewed scientific studies conducted over the years have documented forms of cancer and various other diseases in shark species. For instance, a 2016 study in the Journal of Fish Diseases found that one third of at least 44 cases of lesions in 21 species, including sharks, rays and skates, were malignant. Sharks can get infections \u2013 bacterial and viral \u2013 and parasites too.\n\nThe Daily Caller also reached out to experts, all of whom refuted the Facebook post\u2019s claim. (RELATED: Fact-Checking Trump\u2019s Comment On Wind Farms And Cancer)\n\n\u201cThis claim is false and has proven false multiple times,\u201d said Melissa Marquez, the marine biologist who founded the Fins United Initiative, an education and conservation program. \u201cSharks can get an array of diseases, including cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSharks do get cancer but perhaps at a lower rate than other groups,\u201d University of Guelph integrative biology professor Jim Ballantyne told the Caller in an email.\n\nScientists have been aware of the fact that sharks are susceptible to cancer for more than 150 years, according to Scientific American.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, the myth that sharks have immunity to cancer dates back to at least the 1970s, when researchers at John Hopkins University observed that shark cartilage could stop blood vessels from growing into tissues, as occurs in cancerous tumors. Another scientist in Florida exposed sharks to carcinogens and found that they didn\u2019t develop tumors, according to Scientific American.\n\nThat research formed the basis of the shark cartilage pill industry, which marketed shark cartilage as a miracle cure for cancer, despite numerous studies proving that it has no effectiveness in treating cancer, according to Scientific American. The shark cartilage pill industry has also negatively impacted shark populations, according to the American Museum of Natural History.", "lang": "en"}
