Section 131 of the Constitution states the qualifications for the office of the President.\n\nAccording to the section: \u201cA person shall be qualified for election to the office of President, if:\n\u2022 None He is a citizen of Nigeria by birth;\n\u2022 None He has attained the age of 40 years;\n\u2022 None He is a member of a political party\n\u2022 None He has been educated up to at least school certificate or its equivalent\u201d\n\nDUBAWA has deliberately highlighted \u201cat least school certificate or its equivalent.\u201d The logical question that follows is to ask what is meant by the underlined words.\n\nTo understand this and put the issue in perspective, DUBAWA examined the interpretation section of the Constitution.\n\nThis is Section 318 of the Constitution. According to the Section: \u201cSchool Certificate or its equivalent\u201d means:\n\u2022 None A Secondary School Certificate or its equivalent or Grade II Teacher\u2019s Certificate, City and Guilds certificate; or\n\u2022 None Education up to Secondary School Certificate level; or\n\u2022 None Primary Six School Leaving certificate or its equivalent and \u2013\n\u2022 service in the public or private sector in the Federation in any capacity acceptable to the Independent National Electoral Commission for a minimum of ten years and\n\u2022 attendance at courses and training institutions as may be acceptable to the Independent National Electoral Commission for periods totaling up to a minimum of one year, and\n\u2022 the ability to read, write, understand and communicate in the English language to the satisfaction of the Independent National Electoral Commission, and\n\u2022 any other qualification acceptable by the Independent National Electoral Commission.\u201d\n\nAlthough one requires a minimum of a first degree to work as a Teller in a bank or to even be considered for the post of a security guard in some companies, regrettably, one does not need a WAEC Certificate to contest for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.", "lang": "en"}
