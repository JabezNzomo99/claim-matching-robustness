This is the legal rule that someone who assists or encourages a crime is as guilty as the person carrying it out.\n\nBefore yesterday\u2019s ruling the courts had said that where two people set out on a joint enterprise to commit crime A, and the second person had \u201cforeseen the possibility\u201d that the first person might go on to commit crime B, they are guilty of crime B as an accessory.\n\nThe judgment clarified that the second\u2019s person\u2019s guilt actually requires intention, rather than foresight of the offence\u2014and the court pointed out that the two are not the same thing.\n\nOld convictions may be appealed, but won\u2019t necessarily succeed\n\nThis change doesn\u2019t mean that all previous convictions arrived at by applying the law as it was previously understood will be overturned.\n\nIn its ruling the court said that those convicted under the old interpretation of the law who are out of time to appeal can apply for \u201cexceptional leave to appeal\u201d.\n\nBut, importantly, exceptional leave will only be granted where \u201csubstantial injustice can be demonstrated\u201d.\n\nIt remains unclear how many old cases will be granted the right to appeal. It will depend on what exactly happened in each one.", "lang": "en"}
