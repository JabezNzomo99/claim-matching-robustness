But the photo is from 2009, and it shows state lawmakers in Connecticut, not members of Congress.\n\nDeception and poker go hand in hand, but one of the latest viral images to mislead users on social media invokes the more benign card game of solitaire.\n\nMore than 40,000 users on Facebook shared the meme, which includes a photo of lawmakers sitting behind laptops as a colleague speaks in the background. The computer card game can be seen clearly on two of the screens, while a third screen appears to show an image of a baseball player on ESPN\u2019s website.\n\nBut the image is not current, nor is it of members of Congress \u2014 as the meme implicitly suggests, and as Facebook users commenting and sharing appeared to believe (\u201cThe easy slippery slide to becoming a multi millionaire! Get elected to a congressman!!!\u201d one wrote). It\u2019s actually a 10-year-old photo of state representatives in the Connecticut State Capitol.\n\n\u201cHouse Minority Leader pictured standing, far right, speaks while colleagues play solitaire Monday night as the House convened to vote on a new budget,\u201d the post reads. \u201cThese are the folks that couldn\u2019t get the budget out by Oct. 1, and are about to control your health care, cap and trade, and the list goes on and on.\u201d\n\nIt also says \u201cwe all pay for\u201d those lawmakers\u2019 salary of \u201cabout $179,000 per year,\u201d which is similar to how much members of Congress earn. The current annual salary for most members of Congress is $174,000. On the other hand, state lawmakers in Connecticut, like those in the photo, receive a base salary of $28,000, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThe photo was taken Aug. 31, 2009, by Connecticut-based photographer Jessica Hill, and still appears on her website. Her caption reads: \u201cHouse Minority Leader Lawrence F. Cafero Jr., R-Norwalk, far right, speaks while colleagues play solitaire on their computers as the House convenes to vote on a new budget for the fiscal year in the Capitol, in Hartford, Conn.\u201d\n\nOne of the two lawmakers seen playing the game, Democratic state Rep. Jack Hennessy, publicly apologized after the photo circulated \u2014 calling it \u201cbad judgment \u2026 to play a computer game even for just a few minutes during the final House session on the budget.\u201d He now serves as deputy speaker of the state House.\n\nMisrepresentations of the photo started not long after it was first published: The website Snopes wrote about it in November 2009, noting that \u201cit has erroneously been attributed to a number of different legislative bodies, from the U.S. Congress to a variety of state legislatures.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
