In his speech, the man says if the government is prohibiting entry of more than five people to offer namaz inside mosques, people are also ready to give their lives.\n\nThe video is being widely circulated on social media and netizens are wondering if it is from India. Facebook page \"All India News\" also shared the 1-minute-35-second video.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News Room (AFWA) has found that the video is not from India but Pakistan. The man seen in the video addressing the crowd is Mufti Kifayatullah, a leader of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F).\n\nAs per media reports published on April 13, a large number of people had gathered for a funeral in Pakistan's Mansehra last week. This is where the Mufti had addressed the gathering.\n\nThe Mufti said, \"If you do this, we will be forced to think that mosques are being deserted on America's instructions. We are ready to give our lives, but not ready to desert our mosques.\"\n\nWe found the longer version of the viral video shot from a different angle. This video was uploaded by YouTube channel \"Mufti Kifayatullah Official\" on April 7. The title of the video says, \"Mufti Kifayatullah position regarding the closure of mosques under the cover of corona.\"\n\nThe viral part of the speech can be heard from 2.35 minutes.\n\nWe also found a tweet claiming that the Mufti has been arrested for the speech.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the viral video is not from India but Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
