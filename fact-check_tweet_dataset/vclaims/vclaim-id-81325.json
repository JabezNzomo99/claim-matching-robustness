So he appears to have responded to the White House pressure. But we are more interested in Rubio\u2019s account of how the Obama White House reacted to the protests after the 2009 Iranian election.\n\nLet\u2019s set the stage first. In mid-2009, the Obama administration was relatively fresh, and the president had made efforts to reach out to Iranian leaders, specifically the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The election was held on June 12, and almost immediately the official Iranian news agency announced that the incumbent, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had won an overwhelming victory over his rival, Mir-Hossein Mousavi. The results were a surprise, and almost immediately protests erupted around the country.\n\nObviously all of us have been watching the news from Iran. And I want to start off by being very clear that it is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran\u2019s leaders will be; that we respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran, which sometimes the United States can be a handy political football \u2014 or discussions with the United States. Having said all that, I am deeply troubled by the violence that I\u2019ve been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process \u2014 free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent \u2014 all those are universal values and need to be respected. And whenever I see violence perpetrated on people who are peacefully dissenting, and whenever the American people see that, I think they\u2019re, rightfully, troubled.\n\nWe will continue to pursue a tough, direct dialogue between our two countries, and we\u2019ll see where it takes us. But even as we do so, I think it would be wrong for me to be silent about what we\u2019ve seen on the television over the last few days. And what I would say to those people who put so much hope and energy and optimism into the political process, I would say to them that the world is watching and inspired by their participation, regardless of what the ultimate outcome of the election was. And they should know that the world is watching.\n\nStill, as an account in The Post noted: \u201cSince the election crisis began, the president has sought to preserve his options for future dealings with the government, assuming it survives. While his rhetorical message has sharpened, he has not called the June 12 election a fraud, refused to deal with the announced winner, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, or spelled out sanctions Iran might face if it continues its crackdown on protesters. Obama has also been careful to avoid the appearance of meddling, even to the point of sidestepping all questions on Ahmadinejad\u2019s legitimacy.\u201d Officials at the time argued that since the Supreme Leader remained the ultimate decision-maker, particularly on nuclear issues, making it imperative to avoid picking sides between the two candidates.\n\nIn response, Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon forwarded a New York Times article in which Obama, at a June 16 news conference, said it would be counterproductive for the United States \u201cto be seen as meddling\u201d in the election results. The article noted that Obama the day before had said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the violence. The article also quoted then-Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as defending Obama\u2019s approach to the diplomatic conundrum. So we are not sure what the article proves \u2014 and Sammon made no further comment.\n\nRubio would have every right to offer his opinion that the president was too slow or halting in his response, or did too little too late. But his claim that the president offered no comment at all is simply factually wrong. We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios, but the lack of nuance in Rubio\u2019s stance tipped it toward Three.", "lang": "en"}
