Had Nehru alluded to Bose supposedly entering \u201cRussian territory\u201d? A facsimile of a letter purportedly written by Nehru, addressed to Attlee has been circulating on social media platforms for the last couple of years.\n\nThe copy of the \u2018letter\u2019 allegedly written by Nehru castigates the Russians for allowing Bose to enter their country, calling it a \u201cclear treachery and betrayal of faith by the Russians\u201d. The letter further exhorts Attlee to \u201ctake note of it and do what you consider proper and fit\u201d. It may be noted that there are several versions of this letter doing the rounds. Alt News found that BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy had made a claim in December 2014 about a letter supposedly dictated by Nehru.\n\nPrima facie, the above image that is shared repeatedly on social media appears to be fake. It is replete with errors. Clement Attlee has been referred to as Clement \u2018Attle\u2019, and the first line of the letter states, \u201cI understand from reliable source\u201d (instead of \u201cI understand from a reliable source\u201d). The letter is dated December 27, 1945. It surprisingly refers to Russia as \u201can ally of the British-Americans\u201d, when the opposite was true for 1945 when the world was divided into opposing ideological blocs. There are two things worth noting here:\n\u2022 Subhas Chandra Bose has been referred to as a \u201cwar criminal\u201d\n\u2022 The date of the letter is December 27, 1945 whereas the official account states that Bose died on August 18, 1945.\n\nDid Nehru ever write such a letter?\n\nHow true is the claim that India\u2019s first Prime Minister had called Bose a \u201cwar criminal\u201d? Or that he was cognizant of Bose supposedly being alive and escaping to Russia, referring to the same in his communication with Clement Attlee? Alt News found that a copy of this letter makes an appearance in the files related to Subhas Chandra Bose which were declassified by the NDA government in January, 2016.\n\nFile no.915/11/C/6/96 declassified by the PMO contains a letter written by Pradip Bose, the nephew of Subhas Chandra Bose to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in April 1998. The letter encloses a paper written by Pradip Bose titled, \u2018A Note on the Mysteries of Netaji\u2019s Life and Death\u2019. It is this very paper which cites the letter purportedly written by Nehru to Attlee. Apart from the paper by Pradip Bose, the other place where this letter finds mention is the book \u2018Subhas Bose and India Today: A New Tryst with Destiny?\u2019 which has been written by Pradip Bose. It has also been referred to in the book \u2018Judgement: No Aircrash, No Death\u2019 penned by Lt. Manwati Arya who was part of the Indian National Army (INA).\n\nIt must be taken into account, however, that these are not the words of Jawaharlal Nehru.The letter forms part of the testimony claimed to have been given by Shyamlal Jain, who was the stenographer of Nehru. Jain had supposedly deposed before the G D Khosla commission which was set up in 1970 to look into the question of the mysterious disappearance of Subhas Chandra Bose. The contents of the letter are his recollection of what Nehru had supposedly dictated to him in December, 1945. This is mentioned in the book by Pradip Bose.\n\nJain\u2019s testimony had supposedly not been accepted by the one-man commission which concluded that Bose had died in the aircrash of August 1945 at Taipei in Taiwan. The above testimony doesn\u2019t have the spelling errors that the image that is shared on social media does. This indicates that the image shared on social media is photoshopped so as to make it look like an original old document.\n\nJain in his testimony, according to Pradip Bose\u2019s book, had stated that Nehru had dictated the letter on either December 26 or December 27, 1945 at Congress leader Asaf Ali\u2019s residence in Delhi. Alt News decided to dig deeper into this claim to determine the whereabouts of both Jawaharlal Nehru and Asaf Ali on the said days.\n\nAlt News chanced upon a blog written in 2016 by a social media user @raattai, which chronicled the whereabouts of both Jawaharlal Nehru and Asaf Ali during the days when the letter was purportedly written. This is what we found.\n\nCongress leader Asaf Ali, at whose residence in Delhi it is claimed the letter was written, was in Bombay on December 25, 1945. This is confirmed by a report by the Indian Expressdated December 27, 1945 which stated that Asaf Ali met Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on December 26, 1945. Another report mentions that Ali left Bombay for Delhi on December 27, 1945.\n\nAccording to a report by the Indian Express dated December 28, 1945, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Patna, Bihar on December 25, 1945.\n\nOn the same day, Nehru had travelled to Allahabad where he was for the next few days. This becomes clear from a news report by the Indian Express, and corroborated by a letter he wrote to V K Krishna Menon from Allahabad on December 26. The letter is available in \u2018Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru Volume XIV\u2019 available on Nehru Portal, a repository of the works of Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nWe also found another source, Jawaharlal Nehru Correspondence 1903-1947, which is a compendium of all the letters written by Nehru in the designated time period. Page 36 of this compilation categorically mentions that Nehru had written letters to Burma\u2019s Aung San U on December 26, 1945 and December 27, 1945. In both these letters, his location is specified as Allahabad.\n\nRecords suggest that Nehru was in Allahabad during the end of December, 1945 and NOT in Delhi as claimed by Shyamlal Jain in his testimony. The preface to The Discovery of India was written by Nehru at Anand Bhawan, Allahabad on December 29, 1945.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the contents of this letter are claimed to be the testimony of Shyamlal Jain before the G D Khosla commission in Pradip Bose\u2019s book. In his testimony, Jain claimed the content to be a dictation given by Nehru on either December 26, 1945 or December 27, 1945 at Congress leader Asaf Ali\u2019s residence in Delhi. Jain had supposedly reproduced it from his memory. It is NOT an original letter written by Nehru. However, historical records suggest that Nehru was in Patna and Allahabad from December 25 to December 29,1945, and Asaf Ali was at Bombay on December 25 and December 26, 1945. The contents of the letter circulating on social media and available in the declassified documents are inconsistent with the whereabouts of both Nehru and Asaf Ali, and do not withstand scrutiny.", "lang": "en"}
