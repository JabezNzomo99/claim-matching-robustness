Cries of help can be heard in the background, as armed policemen pull men and women away.\n\nThe clip has been revived in the wake of nation-wide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the NRC.\n\nThe National Register Of Citizens is a government registration document that contains names and relevant information of Indian citizens of Assam. The NRC further seeks to categorise minorities as illegal immigrants, causing many to be worried, after its implementation in Assam.\n\n\n\nThe viral video has been captioned as: \"People are being picked up for not being included in the NRC list. #Assam. If today your protests stop, then tomorrow your fate will be like this.\" (Original text in Hindi: #NRC \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948 \u0907\u0938\u0932\u093f\u090f \u0918\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0909\u0920\u093e\u092f\u093e \u091c\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 #Assam; \u0906\u091c \u0906\u092a\u0915\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0930\u094b\u0927 \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0939\u094b \u091c\u093e\u090f \u0924\u094b \u0915\u0932 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u093e \u0939\u093e\u0932 \u0910\u0938\u093e \u0939\u0940 \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e \u0964)\n\nThe clip has been viewed more than 2.1 lakh times at time time of writing this article. \n\n\n\nThe same video is viral on another Facebook page with a similar narrative. It has garnered more than 2.6 lakh views.\n\nBOOM found that the video is originally from a forest eviction drive by Assam police that has resurfaced with the fake narrative. We broke the video in its keyframes and ran a reverse image search on a few of its frames. We were directed to a longer version of the video from YouTube, which was uploaded in May this year.\n\nWe were then able to ascertain that the footage is from a news bulletin from a local Assamese news channel DY 365 through the watermark. \n\n The same video is uploaded on DY 365 channel's official Facebook page with the following caption. \"As the second day of eviction drive continues at Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary, an appalling incident took place at Kangkan Nagar. An angry protestor identified as Ismail Haque attacked a forest official with a sharp weapon amid the eviction. Security personnel jumped at him immediately and what followed next is...\"\n\nThe incident happened in the Amchang forest area of Assam in December 2017.\n\nBOOM also reached out to a desk editor from the news channel, who corroborated the events.\n\nNews reports said over 700 families were rendered homeless.

The area which has seen the eviction drive for three days in a row was declared an ECZ this past June by an expert committee set up by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF).\"", "lang": "en"}
