You take a look at these people, you study these people, and you\u2019ll understand also. \u2026 These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies.\u201d\n\n \u2013Trump, rally in West Palm Beach, Fla., Oct. 13, 2016\n\nTrump\u2019s message for most of this week was that women alleging sexual assault \u2014 regardless of how many years had passed, whether they filed charges, whether their claims were held up by the courts \u2014 deserve to be heard, rather than discredited or attacked. Trump made this clear by holding a news conference with three of Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers, urging the media to tell their stories and speaking about them in his rallies.\n\nWe have awarded Three Pinocchios to the claim that Hillary Clinton politically attacked the women. To support this claim, her critics have pointed to a Jan. 27, 1998, interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show. This interview took place a week after her husband was accused of having an affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky, when both Lewinsky and Bill Clinton were denying a relationship or sexual history. Clinton blamed Republican foes and the \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d \u2014 not Lewinsky or other accusers \u2014 for making false attacks against her husband. Lewinsky testified about the full extent of their relationship six months after the \u201cToday\u201d interview, after which Bill Clinton confessed to his wife.\n\nOct. 10-12: Trump and his campaign stressed the importance of giving a voice to alleged sexual-assault victims, particularly those connected to Bill Clinton. The campaign told Bloomberg it planned to launch a media blitz featuring Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers (\u201cWe\u2019re going to turn him into Bill Cosby,\u201d Trump campaign manager Stephen Bannon said). The campaign planned to highlight a November 2015 tweet by Hillary Clinton: \u201cEvery survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported.\u201d Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway retweeted it and urged others to do so:\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s accusers \u201chave been trying to get their feelings out for so long, and the media wouldn\u2019t take it. One thing with me, the media takes it. Whatever. So they were able to get what they wanted to get out. To quote Juanita Broaddrick, \u2018Hillary Clinton threatened me after Bill Clinton raped me.\u2019 She\u2019s been struggling to get the media to pay attention to her for many, many years. So last night, I decided we would expose the hypocrisy of the Clintons and the media and our politicians to the entire world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false. \u2026 They\u2019re pure fiction, and they\u2019re outright lies. These events never, ever happened and the people said them meekly, fully understand. You take a look at these people, you study these people, and you\u2019ll understand also. The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic. We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time very soon. \u2026 Last night we hear that after 12 years \u2014 this took place 12 years ago, this story \u2014 a new claim that I made inappropriate advances during the interview to this writer [Stoynoff, reporting for People magazine] and I asked a very simple question: Why wasn\u2019t it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? \u2026 These people are horrible people. They\u2019re horrible, horrible liars. And interestingly, it happens to appear 26 days before our very important election, isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d\n\nFor most of this past week, Trump advocated for accusers of Bill Clinton. He said it was \u201cvery beautiful and very sad\u201d to hear their stories. He blamed Hillary Clinton for attacking the women and discrediting them \u2014 even though her criticism was directed toward the \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d by Republicans, whom she said started rumors about Lewinsky, rather than against Lewinsky herself. He made no reference to how the allegations were made in the 1990s, or that some of the alleged attacks date as far back as four decades \u2014 and that the women waited years to make their claims.", "lang": "en"}
