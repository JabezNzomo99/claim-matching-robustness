Best social distancing example\u2026\u2026 No servants\u2026\u2026\u2026 No drivers.\u201d\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found that the woman in the video is not Deepika Padukone.\n\nSince the woman who is claimed to be Deepika is wearing a mask, so no one can actually identify who it is just by merely looking at the video.\n\nWe extracted the keyframes of the video and put them through Reverse Image Search. We found the same video being posted by popular paparazzi Viral Bhayani on his official Instagram handle. In the caption, he claimed that the woman in the video is actress Rakul Preet Singh.\n\nTaking a cue from this, we scanned through Rakul Preet\u2019s social media handles and we came across a tweet in which she had retweeted the same video and had written \u2013 \u201cOh wow! I wasn\u2019t aware that medical stores were selling alcohol\u201d.\n\nRakul Preet\u2019s tweet came in after she was questioned whether she had purchased alcohol.\n\nIn conclusion, the above information confirms that the woman in the video is NOT Deepika Padukone, but she is actress Rakul Preet Singh.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
