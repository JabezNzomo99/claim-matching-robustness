He has been filmed swimming with soldiers as far back as 2015.\n\nSome media outlets report that the jaguar was seized from hunters. Others say he was found in the Amazon abandoned by his mother.\n\nIt seems very unlikely that the picture was taken during a rescue mission from a previous flood or fire, as there was a professional photographer present, and the people pictured in other photos in the set seem quite relaxed.\n\nFact checkers Columbiacheck have also debunked the image.", "lang": "en"}
