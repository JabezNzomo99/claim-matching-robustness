Sana hindi grabe 'yung focus sa military, sa kapulisan, kasi ito, health concern ito.\"\n\nIn her Biserbisyong Leni radio show on May 31, Robredo said that basketball will not be allowed under the general community quarantine (GCQ). \"Ngayon, sa GCQ, pwede na 'yung outdoor exercises, pero non-contact 'yung sports.... 'Yung basketball hindi pa pwede kasi contact sports 'yun. Pero 'yung hindi contact sports, pwede na. Tennis, badminton, pwede na 'yun,\" she said.\n\nIn the past, Rappler debunked other false quotes attributed to Robredo. One manipulated graphic contained an alleged quote from Robredo saying the virus, not people, should be restrained from spreading, and another altered quote card claimed that Robredo suggested \"inhaling cough back\" to prevent the spread of coronavirus. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
