But Kaine gets some history wrong.\n\nNixon never publicly released his tax returns as a presidential candidate, though he did amid a swirling tax controversy during his presidency.\n\nKaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, has made comparisons with Nixon a regular feature of his stump speeches. Nixon has an interesting history regarding tax returns, but Kaine is botching the facts some.\n\nHere\u2019s what Kaine said in a speech in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on Aug. 30.\n\nKaine made a similar claim the same day at a rally in Erie, noting that Nixon was even under an IRS audit when he released his tax returns, undercutting Trump\u2019s stated reason for refusing to release his own.\n\nFor questions related to tax returns, we turn first to Tax Analysts\u2019 Tax History Project, which has compiled an online archive of tax returns publicly released by presidential candidates. It shows tax returns for Nixon from 1969 to 1972, but Nixon didn\u2019t release those when he was a candidate. Rather, he released them near the end of his presidency in 1973 amid speculation about tax improprieties.\n\nNixon\u2019s tax woes are a fascinating chapter in presidential history that has been largely overshadowed by the unrelated Watergate scandal, which ultimately led to Nixon\u2019s resignation.\n\nBut in 1973 and early 1974, Nixon\u2019s tax scandal was a big deal. Although the IRS had signed off on an audit of Nixon\u2019s returns, public interest was sparked by an IRS leak that called into question Nixon\u2019s use of a charitable deduction \u2014 to the tune of $500,000 \u2014 for vice presidential papers he deeded to the National Archives.\n\nIn an attempt to clear the air, Nixon asked the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation to review his tax returns. The IRS also decided to reopen its audit. As a result of their joint investigation, the taxation committee and IRS determined that Nixon had underpaid on his taxes, and owed $476,431 in back taxes and interest. That was about half of Nixon\u2019s net worth at the time, Joseph J. Thorndike, a historian at Tax Analysts, told us in a phone interview.\n\nAt the time, Democrat Wilbur Mills, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee and vice chairman of the House-Senate committee investigating Nixon\u2019s tax returns, predicted the tax scandal would lead to Nixon\u2019s resignation. It didn\u2019t. Watergate did.\n\nNonetheless, those are the circumstances surrounding Nixon\u2019s release of tax returns.\n\nAs a candidate, Nixon never did publicly release his tax returns, although there is one asterisk. In the 1968 Republican primary, Nixon squared off against Michigan Gov. George Romney, and Romney took the unprecedented step of releasing a dozen years of his tax returns to Look magazine, according to an article in Bloomberg View by Stephen Mihm, an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia. In response, Nixon allowed a Look writer to inspect photocopies of three years worth of tax returns, Mihm wrote. But they were never publicly released.\n\n\u201cThe whole point about publicly releasing them is the public part,\u201d Thorndike said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get the crowd-sourcing. Either you are going to release them publicly or not.\u201d\n\nA reporter quickly reviewing tax returns without the ability to take notes is not the same as the public \u2014 including tax experts \u2014 being able to carefully pick over them, he said.\n\nThere is another interesting footnote to Nixon\u2019s role in the history of presidential disclosure of tax returns. While running as a vice presidential candidate in 1952 as Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s running mate, Nixon got in hot water over questions about some campaign finance issues. Nixon delivered his famous \u201cCheckers\u201d speech \u2014 named after his dog, who was featured in the address \u2014 in which he laid out his personal finances, and challenged his Democratic opponents to do the same.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson upped the ante by releasing 10 years worth of tax returns. Stevenson then called on Nixon to do the same. Nixon refused, but Eisenhower released a summary of his tax returns.\n\nSo in a way, Thorndike said, Nixon helped spur the trend toward candidates publicly releasing tax returns. The later tax scandal in 1973-74 cemented the precedent. Since then, Thorndike said, candidates have provided returns to show, \u201cI\u2019m not Nixon.\u201d\n\nSo Kaine is wrong that Nixon released returns as a candidate. He\u2019s also technically wrong when he says, \u201cCandidates for 40 years, both parties, this is not a partisan statement, have released their tax returns.\u201d In 1976, Jimmy Carter released his. But his opponent, Republican Gerald Ford, refused, and instead only provided a summary of his return. Every presidential nominee from both parties has released some tax returns since then.\n\nKaine\u2019s history is a bit off, Thorndike said, but his broader point about the longtime precedent for releasing tax returns is valid.", "lang": "en"}
