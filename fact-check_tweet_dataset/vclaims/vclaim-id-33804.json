No, that's not true: The former special counsel who investigated Trump's campaign and his administration has not used Twitter to counter any claims of the president. A viral tweet that purported to be from Mueller used a fake account that was since suspended by Twitter.\n\nThe false claim originated from fake Twitter account, but was shared in a post (archived here) published by the People of Bernie Sanders Facebook group on November 16, 2019 under the title \"Whoopsie. Robert Mueller tweets back...\". It opened:\n\nSix Former Trump advisers, 26 Russian nationals, three Russian companies, one California man, and one London-based lawyer. Seven of these people (includin five of the six former Trump advisers) have pleaded guilty. All of these charges stem from our investigation.\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe purported Mueller tweet was a reply to this real Trump tweet:\n\nAfter the fake tweet gained attention on social media, the account was suspended by Twitter.\n\nRobert Mueller has been famously reluctant to publicly comment on the results of his investigation. Even when called to testify before congress, he was tight lipped, sticking close to the words published already in his report.", "lang": "en"}
