In general, across-the-board cuts in tax rates tend to benefit wealthier taxpayers\u2014who after all pay the majority of taxes. (As we have noted before, the top one percent of taxpayers pay nearly 40 percent of federal income taxes collected.)\n\nThe new law did eliminate a number of loopholes to help finance the tax cut, including a $20,000 cap on deducting property taxes and home mortgage interest that was aimed at the owners of large homes and estates. But lawmakers, under pressure from the state\u2019s boat building industry, did not eliminate a $1,500 cap on the sales tax for boats and planes. That\u2019s where the ad gets its line about keeping such tax breaks.\n\nThe ad cites a report from the left-leaning Budget and Tax Center, which is affiliated with the North Carolina Justice Center. But the data in the report comes from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Meg Wiehe, ITEP\u2019s state tax policy director, actually works out of North Carolina and has seen the ad. \u201cWe have not said that 80 percent of taxpayers will pay more under this plan,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nIn fact, when the plan is fully phased in, Wiehe says that ITEP\u2019s analysis of the income tax portion of the law shows that 49 percent of taxpayers will get a tax cut and 35 percent will get a tax increase; 16 percent would see no change. (This analysis includes the impact of lawmakers deciding to allow the expiration of the state\u2019s earned income tax credit, which benefits low-income workers. Some analysts might argue the EITC is not a tax cut, but that\u2019s another story. ITEP also calculated the results without the impact of the EITC. )\n\nITEP calculated the impact of tax law on seven different income levels\u2014the lowest 20 percent, second 20 percent, middle 20 percent, fourth 20 percent, next 15 percent, next four percent and then the top one percent. Breaking up the top quintile into three parts significantly boosts the average incomes, making the benefits appear to flow dramatically to the top one percent. (The average income of the fourth 20 percent is $67,000 and the average income of the top one percent is $940,000. Imagine who pays more in taxes\u2014and thus would benefits most from a tax cut.)\n\nThe ITEP analysis then shows that the average tax change within those income groups. For the bottom 20 percent, with an average income of $12,000, the average taxpayer would see an increase of two dollars. (Yes, you read that correctly; it\u2019s not a typo.) For the second 20 percent, with an average income of $25,000, the average tax payer would pay an additional nine dollars. (Yes, that\u2019s correct\u2013just nine dollars.)\n\nBut within those categories, there are huge differences. In the lowest income category, 29 percent of taxpayers would have an average tax increase of $121 and 32 percent would have an average tax cut of $103. Even among the top 20 percent, a significant portion of taxpayers\u2014about 25 percent\u2014would experience a tax increase since, as we noted, some tax breaks for the wealthy were eliminated.\n\nITEP further added in the \u201caverage\u201d impact of changes in various sales and franchise taxes, which slightly boosted taxes for every income group, even the top one percent. But the amounts were modest\u2014ranging from $22 to $97 for all income groups except the top one percent.\n\nOn its face, it is pretty absurd to think that a tax reform bill that cut rates and eliminated tax loopholes ended up raising taxes on 80 percent of the people in the state. Broadly speaking, the wealthy do appear to gain more from the 2013 tax overhaul, but they also pay the lion\u2019s share of income taxes. And 35 percent of the people appear to face a tax increase, including some of the wealthiest people in the state\u2013not 80 percent, all at the bottom.", "lang": "en"}
