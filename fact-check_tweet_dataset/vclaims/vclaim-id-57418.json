The claim suggests this is from the opening ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games which could not be held due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cJapan decided to do the show under Mount Fuji,\u201d reads the viral message.\n\nThe video below posted by Twitter account @MiguelCalabria3 was viewed over 3,000 times.\n\n\n\nFacebook page IGrow RSA posted a 3-minute version of the same video and wrote, \u201cThe Olympics cannot be opened because of the epidemic, but these fireworks cannot be stored until 2021, so the Olympic fireworks are displayed at this time.\u201d This video has been shared over 12,000 times and viewed over 4 lakh times.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on YouTube and found that the viral video was uploaded by the channel hiramu55bocaboca in 2015 and has over 3 million views. The tune playing in the background is \u2018William Tell Overture\u2019 by Gioachino Rossini.\n\nThe title of 2015 video reads, \u2018FWsim Mount Fuji Synchronized Fireworks Show2\u2019. FWsim is a fireworks simulator tool. Some of the features on the official website state, \u201ccreate firework displays with your favourite music; build your own firework effects, or choose from a huge effects library; 3D worlds with realistic lighting and video export in 4K resolution with shadows and smoke simulation.\u201d While FWsim is a paid software, a free trial is also available.\n\nMoreover, as per the official Olympics website, the Tokyo 2020 games will take place next year after they were rescheduled due to COVID19. In March, the official account of The Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games tweeted, \u201cThe Olympic Games #Tokyo2020 will be held from 23 July until 8 August 2021.\u201d\n\nThis video was earlier fact-checked by American fact-checking website Snopes on August 18.\n\nThus the viral video doesn\u2019t show fireworks at all. It\u2019s a simulation created using computer software. The claim that it shows fireworks set off for Tokyo 2020 Olympics is false.", "lang": "en"}
