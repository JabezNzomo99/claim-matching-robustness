Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nOn the website of the Income Tax Department, it can be found that the Direct Tax collection figures for each state are given. There are no figures based on religion. However, from Census 2011, it was found that the Sikhs formed more than 5% of the total population in Punjab (58%) and Chandigarh (13%), and approximately 5% in Haryana. These three states represent more than 80 per cent of India\u2019s Total Sikh Population.\n\n\n\nThe Direct Tax Collection data (for the year 2016-17) for these regions show that they contributed less than 4 per cent of the Total Direct Tax Collection in the country. Even if it is considered that all the tax collection from these states came from the Sikh community, it can be concluded that the Sikh Community does not contribute 1/3rd of the total Direct Tax Collection in the country as is claimed in the post. There are other claims in the post which could not be verified due to lack of data. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, Sikhs do not contribute 33% of Income Tax in India. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
