Amnesty cited victim and eyewitness accounts of persecution, including the torture and murder of gay men in the Chechen capital Grozny and other parts of the republic,\u200b that were first published by the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta in April 2017.\n\nThe newspaper detailed the plight of more than 100 who were detained and the deaths of at least three Chechen men accused of being homosexual. According to the newspaper, the detentions followed a formal request made in March 2017 to hold a gay-parade, which sparked public protests in the republic, where the newspaper reports even an accusation of being gay can lead to execution.\n\nFacing media coverage of the roundup of gays, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov reported on the situation in the region to Vladimir Putin in late April 2017. He told the Russian president that the information about multiple arrests, torture and killings was \u201ca provocation.\u201d \u200b\n\nKadyrov claimed the only person reportedly murdered by Chechen law enforcement was, in fact, safe and in his own home, and the \u2018coming outs\u2019 were paid for \u201cas a money-making campaign.\u201d\n\nKadyrov denied any evidence of any detentions in the locations indicated in the Novaya Gazeta publications.\n\nPutin\u2019s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said he has \"no reliable information\" of detentions of gay men in Chechnya.\n\nWhile Grozny continues to deny not only persecution and torture of gay men, other evidence has emerged. In October, a gay man, Maxim Lapunov, said in Moscow that he had escaped torture in Chechnya. At a news conference organized by Novaya Gazeta, Leptunov said he was forced to name other gay men and was beaten for being a \u201cRussian who came to Chechnya to corrupt Chechens.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International responded to a request for comment on the statement by Alvi Karimov, the spokesman for the head of Chechnya, denying the very existence of gay men in Chechnya.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time the Chechen government officials accuse human rights activists in \u2018conspiring with the West\u2019 and label them as \u2018enemies of the people\u2019,\u201d the human rights group told Polygraph.info.\n\nIt added that some Chechen leaders like Magomed Daudov, speaker of the Chechen parliament, have even gone so far as to call for the death penalty for human rights activists.\n\nAmnesty also said, in response to Karimov's suggestion it cooperated with the \"Western intelligence agencies,\" it \u201cnever works or coordinates its work with any of the intelligence services\u201d and conducted its own \u201cindependent research into the situation of gay men in Chechnya and used proven information from other human rights NGOs (non-governmental organizations).\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the daughter of slain Chechen human rights activist Natalia Estemirova, who would have turned 60 today but was murdered in July 2009 while working on working on \"extremely sensitive\" cases of human rights abuses in Chechnya, has also commented on the plight of gays in the republic.\n\n\u201cIt is unsurprising that Chechen authorities continue to deny any allegations of the gay purge,\u201d Lana Estemirova wrote in a letter to Polygraph.info. \u201cThe reasoning behind persecution was harrowing -- it seems that upon discovering the existence of gay community in Chechnya, the officials and police aimed to break those men physically and emotionally, purely out of deeply rooted prejudices and hatred. Chechnya is a very conservative, patriarchal republic and Kadyrov\u2019s regime controls every aspect of its social and political life without any distinction between the private and the public. Gay men insult Kadyrov and his henchmen on an existential level and threaten his vision of masculinity \u2013 hence he cannot even bring himself to say the word \u2018gay\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must do everything in our power and urge the Russian government to conduct a proper investigation and grant the victims appropriate protection if they want to testify. We have to continue making Kadyrov uncomfortable,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe Russian non-governmental organization \u201cRussian LGBT Network\u201d said it opened a hot line for gay victims in Chechnya, and reported evacuating over 106 people out of Chechnya and helping provide asylum at European embassies.", "lang": "en"}
