His estate at Monticello labels it a \u201cspurious quotation.\u201d\n\nJefferson served as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, the first secretary of state and the nation\u2019s second vice president prior to becoming president. During his presidency, he brokered the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France, doubling the size of the U.S.\n\nThe Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which maintains his estate at Monticello, keeps a running list of \u201cspurious quotations\u201d frequently attributed to the nation\u2019s third president. A quick internet search revealed that the saying ascribed to Jefferson in the Facebook post appears on that list.\n\n\u201cThis quotation has not been found in any of the writings of Thomas Jefferson,\u201d wrote Anna Berkes, a research librarian at Monticello, in a 2013 entry.
