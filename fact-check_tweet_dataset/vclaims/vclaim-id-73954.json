But experts say this is false, and that the country is far from the point where enough people have the immunity necessary to curb the disease\u2019s spread.\n\n\u201cPOSITIVITY RATE SHOWS HERD IMMUNTIY HAS BEEN REACHED,\u201d says the August 4, 2020 Facebook post from Matthew McBride, who bills himself as a \u201chealth policy expert.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, it was probably reached in May,\u201d according to the post, which includes a chart from Johns Hopkins University that McBride incorrectly says supports the herd immunity conclusion.\n\nThe novel coronavirus -- which causes COVID-19 -- has killed more than 750,000 people worldwide since late 2019, nearly a quarter of them in the United States, which has the highest number of infections of any country in the world but has nonetheless proceeded with reopening the economy.\n\nA false belief that COVID-19 herd immunity has been reached could push people to take unnecessary risks, leading to more infections and a worsening of the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not reached herd immunity,\u201d Dr John Wherry, the director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Institute of Immunology, told AFP by phone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing infection rates continue to rise exponentially in some places, and without... social distancing and other efforts, we are not seeing that spread curbing, which means that the rate of transmission remains extremely high, as if the population as a whole is still very susceptible,\u201d Wherry said.\n\n\u201cHerd immunity for different infections can vary a little bit. Typically depending on the infection you think about somewhere in the range of... maybe 60 to 80 percent of a susceptible population being immune,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, \u201cour estimates are somewhere between maybe five and 15 percent of the US population has been infected and might have immunity or antibodies.\u201d\n\nDr Shelley Payne, director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas at Austin, said that \u201cthe data do not indicate that herd immunity has been reached in the US.\u201d\n\n\u201cHerd immunity will require that a large proportion of the population be infected and have immunity to the virus. We are not there yet,\u201d she said by email.\n\nPayne noted that Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the spread of COVID-19, suggests that COVID-19 herd immunity will require 70 percent of the population to be immune to the disease.\n\n\u201cThe number of confirmed infections in the US is about five million, which is less than two percent of the population. Even if this vastly underestimates the number of infections, we are nowhere near 70 percent,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, herd immunity can be achieved through vaccination or natural infection. But COVID-19 vaccines are still in clinical trials, and it \u201cisn't yet clear if infection with the COVID-19 virus makes a person immune to future infection.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe risk of thinking that we\u2019ve reached herd immunity is that we will see the pandemic continue to spread, we\u2019ll see increased mortality, and we\u2019ll actually see that instead of being able to partially open the economy, we\u2019re gonna have to shut down everything, causing even greater economic problems,\u201d he said.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 600 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
