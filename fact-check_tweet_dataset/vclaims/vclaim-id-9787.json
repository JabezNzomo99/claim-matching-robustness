Nope, no such claims were made by the White House.\n\nThe claim about proof being released appeared in an article published on Daily World Update March 28, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: White House Releases PROOF That Stormy Daniels Is Lying.\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe White House has just released absolute proof that Stormy Daniels, the porn star who says she had unprotected sex with God's choice for President, is a liar. The news came from Information and Propaganda Director Art Tubolls in a statement: \"On the night in question Mr. Trump has proof that not only was he not in New York to have a date with a porn star, he wasn't even in the country.\"\n\nThe words \"a statement\" linked to a Google search for the word \"dumbass\" and the name of the spokesperson (\"Art Tubbols\") is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the nickname of the man who owns the site. He has been trolling conservatives and Republicans online with outrageous fake news for quite some time.\n\nWe wrote about dailyworldupdate.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Gay Pornstar Did NOT Come Forward With Pence Accusations\n\u2022 Fake News: Smithsonian Museums Will NOT Offer $5 'Apology Discounts' To Black People\n\u2022 Fake News: Passenger Plane Full Of Illegals Did NOT Skydive To America, Did NOT Land Inside A Prison\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as ladiesofliberty.net, shareotonin.com and dailyworldupdate.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
