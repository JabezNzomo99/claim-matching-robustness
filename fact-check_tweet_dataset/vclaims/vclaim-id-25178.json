Confrontation between the two groups of Tabligh Jamaat, supporters of Maulana Saad on one side and those who do not like him on the other side led to over 200 muslims being injured.\n\nThis is scary, Muslims fighting Muslims cannot be tolerated. This is the same group that profess itself to be peaceful and kind, but guys you are doing a very bad advertising for your group as well as the entire religion. May Allah (swt) save us. If this is what you do to your fellow hanafis, what would you have done if the conflict was with the followers of some other Madhab.\n\nIt is because of people like these that a peaceful religion like Islam gets a bad name, gets labelled as extremist and barbaric. Well I know this is not the best of you, but you have done a great disservice to Islam and Muslims. For the sake of Allah (swt), please stop! fear Allah! The Prophet (\ufdfa) said:\n\nAbusing a Muslim is Fusuq (evil doing) and killing him is Kufr (disbelief).", "lang": "en"}
