Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.\n\nClaim: Mahatma Gandhi having breakfast with British official inside the jail. Fact: The photo was not taken inside the jail. It was taken during a breakfast meeting between Gandhi and Mountbatten at Viceroy\u2019s House in April 1947. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is run Google Reverse Image Search, a link to Getty Images website containing the same image can be found in the search results. In that website, the image has a description which reads, \u201cBreakfast meeting between Mahatma Gandhi and Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten 1947\u201d. Also, in the book \u2018India Remembered\u2019 written by Pamela Mountbatten (the daughter of Lord Mountbatten), the same image can be found in the \u2018A Huge Task\u2019 chapter. She writes that the photo was taken on 1st April 1947 at the Viceroy\u2019s House. The Viceroy invited Gandhi for breakfast to discuss the transfer of power, declared by England\u2019s PM Clement R. Atlee in February 1947. So, the photo was not taken inside the jail.\n\nTo sum it up, the photo was taken in April 1947 at the Viceroy\u2019s house, not inside the jail.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
