Spokeswoman Olivia Egger confirmed via email that \u201cthe 9/11 Memorial was not vandalized during any recent protests.\u201d\n\nReaders also sent in screenshots of a Facebook meme from an incident that had nothing to do with protests. The meme includes an image of a woman, whom we have cropped out below for the sake of privacy: \n\n While it\u2019s true that an upstate New York woman named Laura M. DiCampli was arrested in September 2019 on suspicion of spraying graffiti on 9/11 and World War II memorials in Geneva, a small city southeast of Rochester, New York, her alleged actions were unrelated to the protests during spring 2020.\n\nWe\u2019ve concluded that the two above posts are hoaxes.\n\nBecause the 9/11 Memorial & Museum was not damaged during the spring 2020 protests, and because a vandalism incident in upstate New York that occurred in the fall of 2019 also was unrelated, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
