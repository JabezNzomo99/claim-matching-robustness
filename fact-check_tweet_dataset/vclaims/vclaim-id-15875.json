The image has been doctored; the original is actually an endorsement of a pro-Duterte candidate.\n\nThe image was published to Facebook here on April 2, 2019, where it has been shared more than 300 times, and also here on the same day.\n\nIt shows Philippine Senator Juan Edgardo \"Sonny\" Angara pointing at the sleeve of fellow Senator Vicente \"Tito\" Sotto III.\n\nHere is Angara\u2019s biography on the senate website. In the image he is standing on the left and Sotto, whose official biography is here, is on the right. \n\n\n\nSotto\u2019s sleeve is adorned with a large number \"8\" with the word \"DIRETSO!\" purportedly written below that.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the posts:\n\nAngara is running for reelection in May 2019 mid-term polls and has been endorsed by President Duterte, according to this article by the state-run Philippine News Agency.\n\nMeanwhile Sotto has expressed support for Duterte\u2019s war on drugs, as reported here by major Philippine media organization ABS-CBN.\n\nThe post's caption, translated to English, says: \"Simple endorsement for #OtsoDiretso\".\n\nOtso Diretso, which means \"Straight Eight\", is the campaign slogan of the eight senate candidates for the Liberal Party, the country's main opposition party. Here is the group's verified Facebook campaign page.\n\nA Google reverse image search found the image has been doctored from this photo posted on Angara's official Facebook account, dated March 7, 2019.\n\n\n\nThe image below compares the photo in the misleading Facebook post (L) with the original image posted by Angara (R):\n\nThe original photo shows Sotto wearing a shirt with a number \"8\" on its sleeve but without the word \"DIRETSO!\"\n\nThe same photo was posted again on Angara\u2019s Facebook page here on March 19, overlaid with a message from Sotto endorsing Angara.\n\nThe first two lines of text on the photo, translated to English, say: \u201cMake sure that we put Sonny Angara back in the Senate, #8 in the ballot, he has done a lot.\u201d\n\nThat post is embedded below:\n\nA sample official ballot appears here on a Philippine government website.\n\nIt shows that Angara is number eight on the ballot in the May 13 vote, which covers local and national positions.\n\nBelow is a screengrab of the sample ballot, with Angara's name circled in red:\n\nComments such as the one below, with the user's identity redacted, indicate that some people believed the false post.\n\nTranslated into English it says: \"Haha these turncoats are funny, they know Otso Diretso is strong that\u2019s why they have the guts to endorse Big 8\".", "lang": "en"}
