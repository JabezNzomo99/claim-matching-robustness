The movement, referred to in shorthand by the somewhat imprecise phrase \u201cdefund the police\u201d faced intense opposition from some right-leaning quarters, especially supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAs a result, companies and organizations faced condemnation for their supposed association with the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement, and in July, readers asked Snopes to examine one such claim.\n\n\u201cStarbucks says Defund the Police. Let\u2019s defund Starbucks. Ask all friends and family not to be Starbucks patrons. Dunkin coffee is just as good!\u201d\n\nWe could find no evidence of any instance in which Starbucks, as a company, called for police forces to be defunded or abolished, promoted or supported the \u201cdefund the police\u201d campaign, or indeed used the words \u201cdefund the police\u201d (or similar phrases) in its public utterances or on its social media accounts. As a result, we are at a loss as to the origins of the false claim that \u201cStarbucks says defund the police.\u201d\n\nThe company has on several occasions articulated support for the Black Lives Matter movement and opposition to racial injustice, but that is clearly not the same as supporting the \u201cdefund the police\u201d campaign.\n\nWe found no evidence that Starbucks supports the \u201cdefund the police\u201d campaign. By contrast, we found ample evidence of the company\u2019s partnering with various police forces as part of the \u201cCoffee with a Cop\u201d initiative, which encourages police officers and members of the public to meet in their local Starbucks caf\u00e9 with the aim of creating understanding, rather than hostility, between law enforcement agencies and the communities they police.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that that initiative seeks to repair and improve relations between police forces and local communities, especially people of color within those communities. As such, it is actually rather antithetical to the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement, whose proponents often argue that those relationships are damaged beyond repair and efforts to reform policing have failed and should no longer be attempted.", "lang": "en"}
