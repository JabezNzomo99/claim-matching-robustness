He has repeated this claim nearly 20 times since. Online activists and prominent right-wing Twitter personalities promoted the theory. And the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officials \u2014 including FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and Attorney General William P. Barr \u2014 appeared to confirm it, echoing Trump\u2019s claim.\n\nOren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at ADL, emphasized, \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge [to identify antifa] because this is not an organized group. You\u2019re essentially looking to try to identify what does somebody believe in.\u201d Antifa has been identified by patches, flags, graffiti and black clothing, Segal explained. And at times, they can be identifiable by moving in \u201cblack bloc\u201d formation. But, Segal hedged, looking to identify antifa by these visual cues is \u201cnot foolproof.\u201d\n\nRoughly 80 federal charges, including murder and throwing molotov cocktails at police vehicles, reveal no evidence of an antifa plot. Four people who identify with the far-right extremist \u201cboogaloo\u201d movement are among those facing the most serious federal charges. Asked whether anyone who identifies as antifa had been charged, Department of Justice spokesman Matt Lloyd said via email, \u201cWe do not collect statistics based on potential inspiration but on unlawful acts according to statute.\u201d\n\nThe DHS said in a June 1 internal intelligence report seen by Reuters that \u201cmost of the violence appears to have been driven by opportunists.\u201d A separate DHS document dated June 17 reviewed by Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent stated \u201canarchist and anti-government extremists pose the most significant threat of targeted low-level, protest-related assaults against law enforcement.\u201d The document did not mention antifa by name and the document\u2019s definition of \u201canarchist extremist\u201d appears to exclude the group.\n\nEven though tangible evidence of antifa\u2019s involvement is scant, as protests multiplied, rumors regarding the movement\u2019s alleged role spread across social media. \u201cWhat we have seen at ADL is that there has been misinformation that has suggested that antifa has been in places where there has not been any proof that they\u2019ve been,\u201d Segal said. This effort, he said, was \u201cmore coordinated it seems than antifa has been at actually being on the ground.\u201d\n\nA Twitter account that claimed to be run by antifa activists and called for violence at the protests was later linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa. A viral May 27 tweet, from a popular QAnon account, alleged that the protests were an effort by the \u201cdeep state\u201d to \u201cstart a race war before the election,\u201d arguing \u201cantifa & BLM are domestic terrorist organizations that need to be STOPPED.\u201d Conservative media outlets and prominent Twitter influencers, including Donald Trump Jr., amplified the theory that antifa was connected to the violence.\n\nBy May 29, there were almost 300,000 mentions of antifa on Twitter, according to an analysis by Zignal Labs, a media intelligence company. The next day, mentions reached nearly 1.5 million. An analysis of the Twitter accounts followed by the president, via Emerson T. Brooking of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, found that about 10 percent of his feed on May 30 suggested in some fashion or other that antifa is a terrorist organization. That day, Trump first blamed antifa for violence at the protests.\n\nBut beliefs and orchestrating organized violence are not the same. There has not yet been a single confirmed case in which someone who self-identifies as antifa led violent acts at any of the protests across the country. The president and his administration have placed an outsize burden of blame on antifa, without waiting for arrest data and completed investigations.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has pointed to antifa as a shadowy nemesis. But the misinformation created by his continued insistence of antifa\u2019s involvement has led to more chaos and violence in an already turbulent moment. As always, the burden of proof rests with the speaker \u2014 and the administration has provided no evidence, only assertions that it has evidence.", "lang": "en"}
