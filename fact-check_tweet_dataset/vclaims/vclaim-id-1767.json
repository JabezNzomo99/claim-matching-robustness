He said tax collections increased seven-fold and those revenues are put into treasury coffers and are used for \u201csocial objectives.\u201d\n\n \n\n While it is true that the 2001 tax reform has been one of the most successful reforms in post-Soviet Russia, experts and economic data suggest Putin may be overstating the success of the reform as it relates to what he called \u201csocial justice.\u201d\n\n \n\n The Russian economy continues to have difficulties and the country\u2019s social programs are not nearly as robust as Putin implies. This includes some socio-economic factors, such as medical care, quality of education and distribution of wealth \u2013 which could fall under a broad concept of \u201csocial justice.\u201d\n\n \n\n Putin claimed that in 2001, when the tax reform was introduced, he was \u201cconcerned that the budget would lose revenue, because those who earn more would have to pay less.\u201d He said he was also concerned \u201cwhether social justice would be ensured and so on.\u201d\n\n \n\n However, as the reform gained traction, \u201cpersonal-income tax collection has increased \u2013 pay attention \u2013 seven times,\u201d Putin said.\n\n\u201cThese funds, which go to the treasury, are then distributed to address social objectives - this is what social justice is all about,\u201d he added.\n\n \n\n Putin appears to be correct in terms of the flat tax impact on revenues, experts told Polygraph.info.\n\n \n\n \u201cThe flat income tax has continued to be highly effective in collecting taxes and making all pay,\u201d Anders Aslund, an economist and Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, said in an email to Polygraph.info.\n\nAs the reform simplified income tax declarations, Aslund said it \u201cleveled the playing field\u201d and turned out to be \u201cone of the main anti-corruption measures.\u201d As a result, \u201cit collects well and is popular.\u201d\n\n \n\n According to Aslund, this is in contrast with the pre-reform period, when \u201cRussia's very wealthy tended not to pay income tax at all and tax collections were miserable -- only 2 percent of GDP.\u201d\n\n \n\n Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told Polygraph.info that two factors contributed to a significant increase in personal income tax revenue: \u201cthe low rate made tax evasion and avoidance much less attractive, and increased incentives to earn income.\u201d\n\n \n\n As for Putin\u2019s claim that tax collection rose seven-fold since 2001, Aslund said it is not surprising, since \u201ceverybody started paying income taxes.\u201d \n\n \n\n But experts question whether the added revenues created a better socio-economic environment, as Putin claimed.\n\n \n\n Even though Russia\u2019s social expenditures are \u201csubstantial,\u201d Aslund said, Putin\u2019s claim that personal income tax is \u201cdistributed to address social issues\u201d cannot be verified since \u201ctaxes are fungible (and) we cannot say how much of one tax goes to what purpose.\u201d\n\n \n\n Putin\u2019s claim may be putting a positive spin on budgeting in general, Mitchell said.\n\n \n\n \u201cIn most nations, the majority of budgets are used for redistribution and social insurance,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cSo any tax, unless it is dedicated to some other cause, will go to \u2018addressing social issues.\u2019\u201d\n\n \n\n Mitchell believes it would be more precise if Putin highlighted that \u201cthe low rate enabled higher collections and that enables more redistribution.\u201d\n\n \n\n Aslund also said that even with increased personal income tax revenue, social programs remain \u201cgenerally poor.\u201d\n\n \n\n \u201cMedical care and education are of poor quality and insufficient,\u201d he said. \u201cPensions are given to too many young people and too little goes to the poor and infirm, while they cost too much and offer poor incentives.\u201d\n\n \n\n The World Bank said in its 2016 Russia\u2019s Economic Report that \u201cthe tax system (in Russia) does not reduce inequality.\u201d The World Bank said that disposable income in Russia contracted by 5.8 percent.\n\n \n\n \u201cIn the first half of 2016, 21.4 million people, or 14.6 percent of the population, had incomes below the national poverty line,\u201d the report said.\n\n \n\n Worsening economic factors also led to \u201can 8 percentage point increase in the share of the vulnerable population with per capita incomes below $10 per day,\u201d the World Bank said. It added that the significant increase of the vulnerable population is \u201creversing many of shared prosperity gains of recent years.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
