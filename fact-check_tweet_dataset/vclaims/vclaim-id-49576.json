The photo is of a Russian soldier and was taken during the 2004 Beslan school siege.\n\nThe posts, including this on Facebook from February 17, 2019, laud the man for heroism, claiming he is returning to fight militants after getting injured in the attack.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post.\n\nThe caption of the post in Hindi translates as: \u201cThis is an injured army soldier coming out to fight after knowing that India has been given a free hand after Pulwama attack. He got up in middle of his treatment, came out of hospital. This is the spirit of our army, salute.\"\n\nAt least 41 Indian soldiers were killed in the attack, on February 14, 2019. Here is an AFP report published two days after the attack.\n\nThere are obvious signs that the photo in the misleading is not from India, including the soldier's features and those of the other men in the background.\n\nA reverse image search quickly confirms this, leading to many photos of the soldier indicating it was taken during a school siege in Russia's Beslan in 2004.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the initial reverse image search.\n\nAFP conducted its fact-check after Indian media outlets debunked the misleading use of the photo, and those results also showed up in the reverse image search.\n\nOne of the fact-checks was this one by India Today.\n\nAFP continued to conduct its own investigation to confirm the origin of the photo.\n\nA search with keywords \u2018Beslan school siege' and Razumovksy\u2019 found that a New York Times article which reported that his name was Dmitry Razumovsky.\n\nThe report stated he was one of 11 Russian special forces who died on September 3, 2004, as they tried to rescue dozens of hostages from Chechen rebels in the southern Russian town of Beslan.\n\nHere is another article about him in the Russian press stating that Dmitry Razumovsky was a Russian serviceman and Lieutenant Colonel. Thirteen years ago, on 3 September 2004, he was involved in the assault on school in Beslan that was captured by terrorists. The Hero of Russia title was conferred upon him posthumously.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article.\n\nA search on Yandex with keywords \u2018Dmitry Razumovsky\u2019 shows the same photo of him in Russian media.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the Yandex search results.\n\nThere is a monument in Russia to him.", "lang": "en"}
