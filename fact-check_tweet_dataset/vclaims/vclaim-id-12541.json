He also has said in other appearances that clean coal can be exported or \u201cloaded up\u201d on railway cars.\n\nBut \u201cclean coal\u201d refers to technologies deployed at power plants that make coal cleaner to burn, not to the fuel itself. Modern definitions require cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, and the only way to do that in a substantial way is through carbon capture. Just two coal power plants in the world use the technique, and it makes up less than 0.1 percent of American coal-fired capacity.\n\n\u201cClean coal\u201d has become a popular talking point for the president, especially when he addresses crowds in coal-producing states, such as West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Montana.\n\nOn Nov. 3 in Belgrade, Montana, Trump said: \u201cAnd we then did the war on clean, beautiful coal, and we are putting \u2014 and you see it better than almost anybody \u2014 our coal miners. They\u2019re all back to work, and they\u2019re going back to work. Clean coal, clean coal. Nobody thought that was going to happen so fast, either.\u201d\n\nBut what does \u201cclean coal\u201d mean? And how does the technology work? We\u2019ll dive into the various ways coal combustion can be made cleaner, and take a look at the future of coal in a world grappling with the effects of climate change.\n\nThe term \u201cclean coal,\u201d which is used by industry, the government and academics, is annoyingly nebulous.\n\n\u201cClean coal turns out to mean largely whatever one wants it to mean,\u201d said Edward S. Rubin, a professor of mechanical engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, in a phone interview. He has worked on energy and environmental issues for almost half a century, and on coal technologies nearly as long.\n\nJulio Friedmann, a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy and CEO of the company Carbon Wrangler, agrees.\n\n\u201cThere is no formal definition of clean coal,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd it is often in the eye of the beholder.\u201d\n\nRubin recalls the term first being widely used in the mid-1980s, when the Department of Energy launched its Clean Coal program. At the time, acid rain was a top priority, and coal plants were a key culprit. Coal contains impurities, that, when burned, escape into the air as harmful air pollutants, including acid-rain-causing chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Fortunately, scrubbers and catalytic converters could be added to power plants to chemically remove the majority of these pollutants.\n\nOver time, the definition expanded as society recognized that burning coal resulted in other pollution problems. In the \u201890s, for example, as scientists realized the importance of mercury emissions from coal, that too became a clean coal signifier. Mercury released into the air eventually makes its way back down to Earth, where it can become a health hazard for humans and damage ecosystems and wildlife. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates coal-burning power plants are responsible for about 42 percent of all man-made mercury emissions in the United States.\n\nFinally, the \u201cclean\u201d label evolved to include reductions in carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas scientists say is driving climate change. The EPA formally designated carbon dioxide as an air pollutant in 2009, in recognition of the harm the gas poses \u201cto public health and welfare\u201d in its role in global warming.\n\nCoal plants pump out inordinate amounts of the gas. According to the Energy Information Administration, coal power plants released 1,207 million metric tons of CO in 2017 \u2014 far more than any other source of electricity. And that\u2019s despite a decline in coal use. As the EPA notes, \u201calthough coal accounted for about 67 percent of CO emissions from the sector, it represented only about 32 percent of the electricity generated in the United States in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese days, my own sense is that talking about clean coal without extending it to mean significant reductions in carbon emissions is basically ignoring the climate-related impacts of coal combustion,\u201d Rubin said.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment Friedmann shares. \u201cI personally believe coal cannot be clean unless it controls CO emissions as well,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Rubin notes that coal industry definitions are often vague, referring to environmental performance improvements that may make only incremental advancements. Even if industry groups accept that carbon dioxide control is part of clean coal, as some do, it\u2019s often a question of how much. Someone could argue, Rubin said, that a 5 percent reduction in emissions is enough to make coal \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nClearly, the \u201cclean\u201d part of \u201cclean coal\u201d is relative, and is better described as \u201ccleaner.\u201d For this reason, many environmentalists think that \u201cclean coal\u201d doesn\u2019t exist and consider the phrase an oxymoron. Coal can never be clean, they argue, because even if sophisticated power plants capture pollutants, there is environmental damage during the mining and transport of coal. Mountaintop removal in particular is notorious for polluting streams and harming ecosystems, especially aquatic ones. This environmental damage is well documented by the EPA.\n\nBut while Friedmann considers these fair complaints, he also thinks they should be put in perspective, as just 5 percent of U.S. coal production is done by mountaintop removal. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t represent a big fraction of how coal is produced,\u201d he said.\n\nThe best technology cannot make coal completely pollution-free or carbon-neutral, but it can mitigate a lot of the negative environmental impacts. This technology, known as carbon capture and sequestration (or storage), or CCS, is a process in which CO is trapped and kept out of the atmosphere, usually by forcing the gas into below-ground formations. As we\u2019ll explain, there are several ways to do CCS. But the technology is expensive and is not yet widespread.\n\nOther \u201cclean coal\u201d methods also address carbon dioxide emissions, including novel ways of burning coal more efficiently. In a standard coal-fired power plant, coal is burned to heat a boiler, which creates steam that turns a turbine, which powers a generator to create electricity. Increasing the temperature and pressure of the steam, as is done in so-called supercritical and ultrasupercritical plants, makes this process more efficient. Because less coal needs to be burned to create the same amount of energy, the plants have smaller carbon footprints. These improvements, however, usually yield only modest reductions in carbon dioxide, such that they still do not match the lower emissions of modern natural gas plants. Rubin said these are also not widely used in the United States.\n\nWhat Trump Could Mean\n\nThe White House did not reply to requests for clarification on what Trump means when he says \u201cclean coal.\u201d Trump could simply be thinking of the basic scrubbers that prevent acid rain \u2014 but do nothing to reduce CO emissions.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s more specific comments, however, incorrectly describe coal itself as being \u201cclean,\u201d not the burning of it.\n\nTake, for instance, the idea that coal sitting in railway cars is clean, and that the U.S. exports clean coal, both ideas he floated in September.\n\nSetting aside Trump\u2019s inflated claims about reviving the coal industry, which we\u2019ve addressed before, Rubin said Trump\u2019s words don\u2019t make a lot of sense, given the normal definitions of clean coal.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t the coal that\u2019s clean,\u201d said Rubin. \u201cIt\u2019s using coal, and using it in a way that generates useful energy, without significant environmental emissions.\u201d All of the meaningful ways to do this, he said, happen at a power plant.\n\nThere is only one plausible way Trump could argue his case, and it\u2019s a stretch.\n\nHe could be thinking of coal cleaning or coal washing, an older technology that removes impurities, such as non-combustible mineral matter and sulfur, from coal. This can cut down on coal ash pollution, and slightly reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. But this processing hardly makes coal clean.\n\n\u201cToday, no one really thinks of coal cleaning as a significant clean coal technology,\u201d said Rubin.\n\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, less than 20 percent of U.S. coal is washed, usually higher-sulfur coal in the East, and cleaning does not change coal\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nCoal washing, notably, appears on a list of technologies posted on the American Coal Council\u2019s website, but the industry group is careful to label the entire list \u201ccleaner\u201d rather than \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAs for the export claim, Friedmann is equally baffled.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I don\u2019t see how you can export coal and call it clean unless you export clean coal technology with it,\u201d said Friedmann, adding that this is something the Trump administration is not doing.\n\nAnd no exported coal heads to carbon capture facilities. Of the two coal-fired CCS plants, only one \u2014 the Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan, Canada \u2014 is outside the United States, and it gets its coal domestically.\n\nUnderstanding the basics of how coal-based carbon capture and sequestration works will help explain why it isn\u2019t more widespread.\n\nThere are three main ways to do carbon capture, which differ in when and how the CO is removed:\n\u2022 Post-combustion the coal has been burned. This is the only capture method in commercial operation. Essentially, before the flue gases are sent up the chimney, the CO is pulled out with chemicals, usually nitrogen-rich amines. This technique can be applied to existing coal plants as a retrofit \u2014 a huge advantage over the other methods. But it still takes quite a bit of energy to run the system, Rubin explained, mainly because the CO -absorbing chemicals need to be stripped of CO so they can be regenerated and used again.\n\u2022 Pre-combustion : CO is captured from a coal-sourced gas being burned. The carbon capture part is less expensive than in post-combustion capture, but the overall cost of gasification plants is high. To Rubin\u2019s knowledge, just two American power plants use gasification at all. One plant, in Kemper County, Mississippi, was designed to do coal gasification with carbon capture, but had to scrap those plans after cost overruns and delays. It now runs on natural gas.\n\u2022 Oxy-fuel rather than air. This makes it easier to collect the CO , but according to Rubin, running an oxygen plant takes a lot of energy, and the economics may or may not make sense compared with post-combustion capture.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the basic technology hasn\u2019t changed much since we last wrote about it in 2009, when then-President Barack Obama was taking heat from environmental groups for supporting clean coal. What has changed is that there are now two commercial coal CCS plants in operation. One is the Petra Nova plant in Houston, Texas, which came online in 2017, and the other is Canada\u2019s Boundary Dam, which debuted in 2014. Both grab the CO after combustion using chemicals, although their setups are different.", "lang": "en"}
