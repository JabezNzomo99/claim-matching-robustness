In a news release announcing House Resolution 4433 -- the Appalachian Regional Energy Hub Initiative -- McKinley said he backs the effort and cited Hurricane Harvey, the 2017 storm that shocked coastal Texas and Louisiana, as evidence that a more reliable storage system is needed.\n\n\"Developing such a \u2018Hub\u2019 in Appalachia would bring significant investment and jobs to the region,\" McKinley said in his op-ed for the Fairmont News.\n\nIn his news release, McKinley wrote that the danger for the nation is that today, \"about 95% of America\u2019s production of ethylene is produced on the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana \u2014 a region exposed to major storms like Hurricane Harvey.\"\n\nIs he right about that percentage? We took a closer look.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explain what ethylene is.\n\nEthylene is commonly used to produce polyethylene, which is one of the most commonly produced plastics in the world. Food packaging and containers, bottles, and housewares are among the products manufactured from polyethylene.\n\nMcKinley\u2019s District of Columbia office pointed us to a report to Congress by the U.S. Energy Department released in November 2018.\n\nThe report includes a line that says that \"ethylene production capacity is highly concentrated in the United States Gulf Coast; over 95% of U.S. ethylene production capacity is located in either Texas or Louisiana.\"\n\nThe figure below illustrates the total capacity in million metric tons that each region produces, the majority of which comes from Texas and Lousiania.\n\nDocumented Ethylene Production Capacity in the U.S. (Source: Ethane Storage and Distribution hub in the United States)\n\nAfter Hurricane Harvey hit the U.S. in Texas and Louisiana, 60% of the production capacity in America went offline, causing problems for industry, at least in the short term.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these numbers can be expected to shift once a major \"ethane cracker\" plant in Monaca, Pa., comes online in another year or two.\n\nCrackers are facilities that break down ethane into multiple byproducts, including ethylene. The Shell Chemicals facility in Monaca is expected to produce 1.6 million metric tons per year of ethylene.\n\nThe Energy Department report cites two additional ethylene facilities in the Appalachian region that are on the drawing board, though they are slated to come online after the Monaca plant. They are in Washington Bottom, W.Va., and Shadyside, Ohio.\n\nMcKinley said, \"About 95% of America\u2019s production of ethylene is produced on the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana \u2014 a region exposed to major storms like Hurricane Harvey.\"\n\nThe scale of operations in Appalachia are on track to grow in the coming years, but for now, McKinley is correct: Energy Department data shows that more than 95% of U.S. ethylene production capacity is located in either Texas or Louisiana.", "lang": "en"}
