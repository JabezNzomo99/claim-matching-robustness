The claim is false; India\u2019s central bank said the posts were a hoax, adding that banks do not ask for such documents.\n\nThe photo of the purported advisory was published on Facebook here on March 10, 2020. The post has been shared nearly 500 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe advisory\u2019s Hindi-language text translates to English as: \u201cImportant information, everyone is hereby informed that they should withdraw all their money from all the banks before March 31, 2020. From April 1, 2020, all the banks will ask for NPR documents, and if anyone fails to produce it their accounts will be blocked. Share it widely.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s caption translates as: \u201cImportant information, more importantly for Muslims, withdraw all your money from the banks by April 1, 2020, otherwise, you will lose it.\u201d\n\nNPR refers to the National Population Register, a government record of all \u201cresidents\u201d of India who have lived in a specific locality for six months or more. It was first implemented in 2010 to track population density.\n\nThe photo has been shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here and here; and on Twitter here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which controls currency supplies and regulates the nation's banking system, refuted the claim, describing it as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\"The news is absolutely false and neither banks nor RBI have asked for any NPR documentations from customers,\u201d Yogesh Dayal, an RBI spokesperson, told AFP by phone on March 13, 2020.\n\nThe RBI has not published any press release on its website here about banks asking for NPR documents.", "lang": "en"}
