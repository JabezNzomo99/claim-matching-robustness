No, that's not true: The statement was posted by a different Tim Allen, not the Tim Allen who voiced Buzz Lightyear in all the Toy Story movies.\n\nThe claim appeared in a Facebook post (archived here) where it was published on August 25, 2020. It opened:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nFrom :Tim Allen\n\nHere are some interesting points to think about prior to 2020, especially to my friends on the fence, like moderate Democrats, Libertarians and Independents and the never Trump Republicans and those thinking of \"walking away\" from the Democratic party. Women are upset at Trump's naughty words -- they also bought 80 million copies of 50 Shades of Gray. Not one feminist has defended Sarah Sanders. It seems women's rights only matter if those women are liberal.\n\nThe claims made in the statement itself is out of the scope of this fact check.\n\nParts of the text in this post have been circulating since April 2019, according to Snopes' fact check on the same claim. The longer statement now circulating on Facebook was likely misattributed to the actor Tim Allen when a Facebook user with the same name posted the statement.\n\nAllen's manager told Reuters, who conducted a fact check on the same claim, that the posts are not from Tim Allen his client.\n\nAllen has never publicly endorsed Trump and he did not post this statement.", "lang": "en"}
