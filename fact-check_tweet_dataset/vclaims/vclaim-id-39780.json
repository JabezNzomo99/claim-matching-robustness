Roosevelt in 1945. During his presidency, he presided over the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan and the end of World War II for U.S. forces.\n\nThough Truman wrote and spoke extensively on a variety of subjects, there is no evidence that the quote originated with him. The Harry S. Truman Presidential Library has no record of the expression in its collection of Truman\u2019s writings. A search of the National Archives didn\u2019t turn up any matching phrases either.\n\n\u201cWe have never been able to confirm or verify that President Truman ever wrote or said, \u2018If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,\u2019 a quote that is often attributed to him,\u201d said Samuel Rushay, an archivist at the Truman Library, in an email to the Daily Caller.\n\nAccording to the website Quote Investigator, the false attribution to Truman may come from Samuel Gallu\u2019s 1975 play \u201cGive \u2019em Hell, Harry,\u201d in which a fictional Harry Truman character said, \u201cYou want a friend in life, get a dog!\u201d\n\nThe source of the quotation is unknown but, according to etymologist Barry Popik, it has been in print since at least 1911.", "lang": "en"}
