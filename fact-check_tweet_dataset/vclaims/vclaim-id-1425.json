Kander, who is Missouri\u2019s secretary of state and a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, puts together an AR-15 in 30 seconds. As he assembles the gun, he talks about how his opponent, Republican Roy Blunt, has attacked his record on guns Kander, a former Army captain, says \"In the Army, I learned how to use and respect my rifle.\" He continues to say, \"In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights,\" while supporting background checks to keep guns like the AR-15 \"out of the hands of terrorists.\" Kander was a Missouri state representative for four years, from 2009 to 2012, before he was elected secretary of state.\n\nIn 2011, Kander voted in favor of a bill that would lower the age \u2014 from 23 to 21\u2014 at which a person could get a permit to conceal and carry a gun. Kander voted against the bill when the House first debated it, but switched for the final vote. The bill became law.\n\nThat same year, Kander voted for a resolution that would amend the Missouri Constitution to protect \"the right of every citizen to possess, purchase, reload, or manufacture ammunition and any other parts or articles essential to the proper functioning of arms.\" The resolution died in a Senate committee.\n\nIn 2009, Kander voted against a bill that would extend the Castle Doctrine to renters. The doctrine allows a homeowner to use deadly force against a perceived intruder. The bill also would have lowered the age to get a concealed carry permit and would remove a ban on carrying a gun on a college campus.\n\nIn the Heller decision, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, made clear that while D.C. could not ban handguns, the Second Amendment is \"not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\"\n\n\"Even if one believes in the Second Amendment right to have guns, that does not mean that every law to allow more access to guns should be regarded as a good thing,\" he said. \"Someone could believe in the Second Amendment, but still support some restrictions on guns.\"\n\n\"The Supreme Court has only said that the right protects the right to have a handgun in the home,\" he said in an email. \"So long as he did not vote to deny law-abiding people that right, then he can reasonably claim to be a supporter of the right to bear arms.\"\n\nAs a state representative, Kander voted in favor of two bills, which are now law, that would lower the age for someone to conceal and carry a weapon. On the other hand, he also voted against several bills that would reduce regulations on guns.", "lang": "en"}
