The announcement came after employees of the publishing house staged a walk-out \u201c in solidarity with Ronan Farrow, Dylan Farrow, and survivors of sexual assault.\u201d Ronan, a journalist and the son of Allen\u2019s former partner Mia Farrow, had earlier declared he would no longer work with the publisher if it released Allen\u2019s memoirs.\n\nRonan Farrow and sister Dylan allege that Allen sexually molested her when she was a child, a charge Woody Allen has denied for years.\n\nOn March 9, Margarita Simonyan, chief editor of the Russian state-owned media conglomerate Rossiya Segodnya, which includes RT, Sputnik International and RIA Novosti, responded to the news in an RT piece.\n\nUnder the headline \u201cWoody Allen, we will publish your book,\u201d the piece said:\n\n\u201cWe will publish your book because we still remember a time when books were banned, and do not wish to see it return.\n\n\u201cWoody Allen, we will publish your book because we believe in free speech.\u201d\n\nThat is misleading. In fact, the Russian government bans thousands of books, and routinely bans websites. For example, on March 12, Russia\u2019s communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, banned a website opposed to constitutional changes proposed by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRussia\u2019s justice ministry has banned books and literature deemed \u201cextremist.\u201d While that list includes some books banned in other countries, such as Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf, it also bans publications by the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, a Christian group that\u2019s faced Russian government persecution since 2016.\n\nRussian authorities have used the possession of banned literature from the Islamic group Hizb-ut-Tahrir as a pretext to justify the arrest of Crimean Tatars and other Muslims in Russia.\n\nOn March 11, Simonyan posted an item on Facebook repeating many of the points she made in her RT piece \u2013 and some additional claims:\n\n\u201cThey refused [to publish your book] because your son, who also published his book in the same publisher, was categorically against it. Because he hates you for marrying his mother\u2019s adopted daughter. And married to her for 23 years.\u201d\n\nThat post made no mention of the molestation allegations or the walkout by Hatchette employees sympathetic to Ronan and Dylan Farrow.\n\nThe Allen-Mia Farrow story has many twists. The couple split in 1992, after it was revealed that Allen had a relationship with Farrow\u2019s adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. Allen and Previn have been married for more than two decades. Farrow appeared in many of Allen\u2019s movies in the 1980s and early \u201890s. Rolling Stone magazine recapped their story and Previn\u2019s defense of Allen two years ago.\n\nRussian state media and politicians have reacted negatively to the rise of the #MeToo movement -- which arose in tandem with Ronan Farrow\u2019s journalistic investigation into allegations of sexual assault and harassment against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. The Russians have defended some of the men accused of misconduct. Putin publicly dismissed #MeToo during his annual televised call-in program in 2018.\n\nRussia had its own #MeToo controversy in which female journalists accused State Duma Deputy Leonid Slutsky of sexually harassment. Slutsky\u2019s case was later reviewed by the Duma\u2019s ethics committee, which decided that he had not acted inappropriately.\n\nAllen\u2019s publisher in France (\u00c9ditions Stock, a French affiliate of Hachette), where his films have a huge fan base and Allen is less controversial, has vowed to publish the memoir. Famed horror writer Stephen King also criticized the decision to drop the book, but added that Hatchette had been \"tone deaf\" to sign Woody Allen after already publishing the work of Ronan Farrow.", "lang": "en"}
