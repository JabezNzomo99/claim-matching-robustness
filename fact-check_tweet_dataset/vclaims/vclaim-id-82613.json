But the Pakistan army mistook it for an Indian Airforce aircraft and shot it down. The news became viral despite various efforts by Pakistan to hide it.\"\n\nWithin 16 minutes, the post went viral, garnering 112 shares and nearly 300 reactions.\n\nThe article by The Fauxy, which was shared in the post, explained how the Pakistani army erroneously shot down one of its own aircraft owing to the panic that has allegedly ensued in the country due to its fear of India's retaliation after the Pulwama attack.\n\nThe website has put out a disclaimer on its pages which clearly state that it is a satirical website and that their content is fictional.\n\nHowever, going through the comments of the post, it was apparent that many users were oblivious to that fact.\n\nSoon, many users and pages started sharing the photo of the crashed aircraft with same caption, but without the link to the satirical website which is the source of the article, making the fake news go viral.\n\nFor an archived version of the post, click here.\n\nBOOM did a reverse image search with the photo of the crashed aircraft and found out that it originated from an incident in Belgium when an F-16 fighter jet was mistakenly shot down by another plane near the Florennes air base.\n\nDaily Mail had used a similar photo while reporting on this matter in an article dated October 13, 2018.\n\nBOOM extracted the photo from both the articles and placed them next to each other, only to find striking similarities between them.\n\nThis confirms that the story about Pakistani army shooting down their own aircraft due to fear of India is a satirical fabrication, inspired by the events in Belgium last year.", "lang": "en"}
