The CNN interview, with Erin Burnett, was one of his first appearances speaking for the White House.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) weeks after taking office in 2009. The law provided $787 billion in stimulus funds over several years. Congress later added more funding in 2012, for a total stimulus of $840 billion, according to a now-defunct government website called Recovery.gov. (The Fact Checker pulled up a copy from 2015 using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.)\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, plummeting home values, spiking energy prices, chaos in the banking and financial sectors, and a crisis in the auto industry were some of the leading factors causing the U.S. economy to go haywire and into recession.\n\n\u201cIn response, policymakers quickly moved to prevent the instability in housing and financial services from spilling over into the broader economy,\u201d according to a 2009 report from the Congressional Research Service. \u201cLooking to the future, members of Congress and the Obama administration sought additional mechanisms to stimulate economic activity. Various approaches were considered to ensure that an economic stimulus package could reach many different segments of the economy, provide a sustained economic boost, and widespread job growth. Some economic stimulus proposals included infrastructure spending, revenue sharing with states, middle class tax cuts, business tax cuts, unemployment benefits, and food stamps.\u201d\n\nKudlow described this stimulus package as \u201call spending,\u201d but it was not. Of the total $840 billion stimulus, $290.7 billion, or 35 percent, was designated as tax relief. This included dozens of measures, such as a payroll-tax holiday, tax credits for first-time home buyers and for people buying electric vehicles, increased exemptions from the alternative minimum tax, credits and incentives geared at businesses and infrastructure projects, and COBRA health-care benefits for laid-off workers. Although the ARRA did not modify tax rates set in statute, this $290.7 billion reduced effective tax rates across the country.\n\n\u201cThe final package was very well diversified. Roughly one-third took the form of tax cuts. The most significant of these was the Making Work Pay tax credit, which cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. Taxes for a typical family were reduced by $800 per couple for each of 2009 and 2010. Another provision of the bill provided roughly $14 billion for one-time payments of $250 to seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities. The macroeconomic effects of these payments are likely to be similar to those of tax cuts.\u201d\n\nSpending for all other categories represented 45 percent of the total $840 billion stimulus. This included some items that could fairly be described as \u201cwelfare programs and social spending,\u201d such as $105.7 billion to shore up Medicaid and Medicare and $14 billion for housing. But it also included $94 billion for education, $5.7 billion for public safety, $1 billion for agriculture, and billions of dollars for other programs that had nothing to do with welfare and could only tenuously be described as \u201csocial spending\u201d (or \u201csocial services,\u201d which Kudlow possibly meant to say).\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that the ARRA combined hundreds if not thousands of different initiatives into one massive stimulus package. So there are many ways to slice and dice the numbers on Recovery.gov. The bottom line of our analysis is that it\u2019s hard to see how \u201cwelfare programs and social spending\u201d could fairly be made to account for more than half of the ARRA, as Kudlow claimed.\n\nLastly, we feel compelled to point out that Kudlow made a couple more factual errors mere seconds after these remarks. He said \u201cthe Obama stimulus package \u2026 was, what, a trillion dollars at the beginning.\u201d It was actually $787 billion at first and rose to $840 billion.", "lang": "en"}
