If the patient can also chew raw onions, they should do that, and I assure you of your recovery.\u201d\n\nAccording to the speaker, he is a traditional healer and a specialist in herbal treatment.\n\nResponding to the claim, a Communications Adviser at the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa, Collins Boakye-Agyemang said: \u201cit is not true.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are currently no drugs licensed for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThere is no scientific proof that chewing onions in large quantities can in any way help cure or help people recover from the coronavirus\u2026 We will advise fellow Ghanaians who speak Hausa or those who have heard the voice clip in the Zongos to disregard it. It is not true.\u201d Head of Food Industrial Support Services Department at the Ghana Food and Drugs Authority (FDA), Ebenezer Kofi Essel also told GhanaFact.\n\nA number of fake cures and unproven treatments being widely circulated on social media have been debunked by the WHO on its website: \u201cCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: Myth busters\u201d page.\n\nMany studies have linked onion consumption with increased immunity, \u201cbut the strain COVID-19 is so new that there have been no studies specific to onions and coronavirus,\u201d the NOA has stated on its website.\n\nThe National Onion Association(NOA) is an organisation that represents America\u2019s onion growers and its supporting industry.", "lang": "en"}
