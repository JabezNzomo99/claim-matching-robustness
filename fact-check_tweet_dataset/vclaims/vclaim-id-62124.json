The age range for out-of-school children is 6-11 years.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, even though primary education is officially free and compulsory, about 10.5 million of the country\u2019s children aged 5-14 years are not in school. Only 61 per cent of children between 6 and 11 years of age regularly attend primary school and only 35.6 per cent of children aged 36-59 months receive early childhood education.\n\nUNICEF added that one in every five of the world\u2019s out-of-school children is in Nigeria. The country currently harbours about 13 million \u2013 the highest in the world.\n\nAlso, on October 4, 2018, the Executive Secretary, Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), Ahmed Boboyi, claimed that the figure of out-of-school children in Nigeria rose from 10.5 million to 13.2 million.\n\nThe Executive Secretary, who was represented by the Director of Social Mobilisation, Bello Kaigara, at the Northern Nigerian Traditional Rulers Conference on Out-of-School Children pre-conference briefing in Abuja, quoted the Nigeria Demographic Health Survey (NDHS), which, he said, was conducted in 2015 by the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cIf you add the number of children that have been displaced and the increasing number of birth, you find out that our source in DHS conducted by UNICEF published in 2015 reveals the number of out of school children increased to 13.2 million. Over the last few years, Nigeria has been besieged by Boko Haram and lots of children have been put out of school\u201d Boboyi claimed.\n\nIn another contrasting figure, the Universal Basic Education Commission report in 2018 released on December 17, 2019, titled \u201cDigest of Basic Education Statistics for Public and Private Schools in Nigeria\u201d, the whole of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria have only 10,193,918 (10.1million) out-of-School-children.\n\nThis, he said, at a press conference in Abuja, was part of the 2018/2019 Annual School Census, which was carried out by the Universal Basic Education Commission, National Population Commission, National Bureau of Statistics and other stakeholders.\n\nAs COVID-19 pandemic continues to hold its grip across the globe, about 7 million students from primary up to secondary education could drop out owing to the income shock of novel Coronavirus alone, a report by World Bank Group Education revealed.\n\nThe report, using data from 157 countries, revealed that both the global level of schooling as well as learning will fall. With this projection, the future is even bleaker for children of school age in these agriculture communities who are already counting their losses due to the bad roads.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)\u2019s summary report, 2010 \u2013 2012 released in February 2015, as of 2010, close to 3 million children aged 6 to 14 years had never attended any school in Nigeria. This represents 8.1% of the population of children within that age group. Also, during the same period, about a million children aged 6 to 14 years dropped out of school. This represents 3.2% of the population of children in that age group that never attended school in Nigeria.\n\nFurthermore, there are regional variations as the percentage of the population that attended schools in the year 2010 was higher in urban areas (91.4%) than in rural areas with 80.7%. Also, gender variation still exists in school attendance in Nigeria. In the aforementioned year, females\u2019 attendance stood at 81.2%, lower than that of males\u2019 with 88.1%.\n\nDoes Nigeria have no data bank on Out-of-school-Children?\n\nThe ICIR contacted experts in the field of data on the clash of figures and unavailability of unified data on the total number of out-of-school children in Nigeria.\n\nAtiku Samuel, a data expert and senior project Officer (Technical Coordination) at the International Budget Partnership (IBP), explained to The ICIR that with the varying data on Out-of-school children in Nigeria, \u201cI don\u2019t think we have reliable statistics that tell us the total number of out of school children\u201d.\n\nThe data expert added that across the years, people drop out of school because of many reasons. And again, there are private schools that are not registered, even some children in private school could actually be categorised as out of school.\n\n\u201cFirst, you look at deductions, you look at the total pupil in JSS3, the ministry of Education has a number of people in JSS3, by the time you compare it with people entering SS1, you will see the gap, and that\u2019s the basis of the data NBS is pushing out\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have a statistical nightmare. I think the matter concludes that we really don\u2019t know for certain how many children are out of school. But based on the estimate done by Unicef, which is the most recent survey, we are looking at about 10.5million. I think that\u2019s the closest and it is age-specific,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nHowever, Joshua Olufemi, the founder of Dataphyte, in a phone interview maintained that we can not say Nigeria lacks unified data on out-of-school children because, according to him, data managed by UBEC can still be regarded as unified because of its domestic nature.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t categorically say that we don\u2019t have unified data. If we are going to have any unified data on out of school children it should be the one warehoused or managed by the Ministry of Education in conjunction with state ministries of education.\n\n\u201cIf the UBEC database or ministry of Education exists, that will be the unified one but the most important question is how format and which way and how frequent is that data collected which talks about the method of collection, chronology of collection, resources to collect and also how much the ministry of Education prioritised that data.\u201d\n\nThe barrage of inconsistent data on out-of-school children is fuelling false information and excluding students forced out of school due, in part, to insurgency or those enrolled in unregistered private schools across the country. While UBEC, in partnership with states, seem authoritative in their figures, the absence of a curated national data bank and a rigorous method of data collection are stifling the fight against false information in the country.\n\nTo escape this data nightmare, the country needs two things: a well defined data collection strategy, and the political will to ensure an efficient data management.\n\nThis article is a republished content from ICIR per our Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with newsrooms and media organisations.", "lang": "en"}
