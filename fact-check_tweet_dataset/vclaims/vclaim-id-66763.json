It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America. Blaming the prince of the fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince. The republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools, such as those who made him their president.\"\n\nThose are pretty harsh words to come from a head-of-state, particularly one with whom Obama seems to have a . But after scouring the Internet, we found zero evidence that Klaus ever said this.\n\nSome context: Klaus was president of the Czech Republic from 2003 to 2013, when he was impeached on treason charges. The charges were later dropped, but he did not resume his post. He is now a at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nSome others, including , have tried to debunk the attribution years ago.\n\nThe quote has been floating around on blogs, email chains and comment boards since at least early 2009 and has had many attributions. We\u2019ll go through a few.\n\nThe earliest sighting we found was from April 30, 2009 -- just under five months after Obama took office -- on a . That post said the quote came from \"Prager Zeitungon, a Czech newspaper.\"\n\nThis appears to be a misspelling of the weekly . However, there is no online record of this quote ever having been published in the newspaper, and as of today only pulls up 13 articles with the word \"Obama\" in them -- all written since 2012.\n\nA similar but unattributed quote (with some additions) was posted in December 2009, on another that no longer exists. We also found the quote unattributed in a 2010 self-published e-book called (page 47) by Richard McKenzie. It even appeared in print, as a May 2010 letter-to-the-editor in , a newspaper in North Carolina.\n\nFunnily enough, this quote has gone global. People in several other countries have swapped out \"Obama\" and \"America\" for their own leaders and countries.\n\nPossibly the most often-occurring version after the American one is from . It replaces Obama\u2019s name with Jacob Zuma, their president, elected in 2009. Many people posting that version have attributed it to a named Ken Peters. We can\u2019t find an economics professor by that name -- Czech or otherwise -- associated with anything other than that quote.\n\nThe quote has also been adapted for politicians in other countries. It's appeared in posts and comments in , , the , , and .\n\nA chain email said the former president of the Czech Republic said the American people were a \"confederacy of fools\" for electing Obama.\n\nThis quote has had various attributions since it first appeared on the Internet more than five years ago. The quote\u2019s true origins may be forever buried far down in the depths of the Internet, but we\u2019re sure it didn\u2019t come from Klaus.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
