He has long had a reputation for being private.\n\nSo, the actor definitely didn\u2019t say: \u201cFor Me, Trump Is The Symbol Of A Successful Man And A Role Model For Every Young American, Something That Our Nation Was Looking For Years. I Don\u2019t Think That America Will Again Have A Leader Like Him.\u201d That\u2019s from a headline on more than a dozen dubious websites that have published a story claiming that he did.\n\nThe story has been shared more than 3,000 times on Facebook, and users of the social media site have flagged it as potentially false. It is.\n\nWe found no record of Reeves making any public statement about President Donald Trump, and the rest of the story is a barely modified version of a profile of Reeves that ran in the Telegraph, a British newspaper, while he was promoting his 2014 movie, \u201cJohn Wick.\u201d The article looks back at Reeves\u2019 career, and says nothing about Trump or politics.\n\nMany of the sites that ran the story with the made-up quote also included a video of a 2014 interview with Reeves on Uruguayan television in which he talks about that same film and his travel preferences. Reeves doesn\u2019t mention Trump in the segment, which aired before Trump was a candidate for president.\n\nAlso, similarly questionable websites \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 have attributed the same made-up quote about Trump to actors Russell Crowe and Geoffrey Rush.\n\nFalse quotes like this one can take on a life of their own, too, as illustrated by yet another dubious website that inserted the quote attributed to Reeves into a story about Trump earlier this month.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cActor Keanu Reeves: \u2018For Me Trump Is The Symbol Of A Successful Man And A Role Model For Every Young American, Something That Our Nation Was Looking For Years.I Don\u2019t Think That America Will Again Have A Leader Like Him,\u2019 Do You Support Him?\u201d PoliceNews.info. 6 Mar 2018.\n\nCollin, Robbie. \u201cKeanu Reeves: \u2018I felt like I was fighting for my life.'\u201d The Telegraph. 9 Apr 2015.\n\nClayton, Jim. \u201cTrump Keeps Improving America While Critics Keep Attacking Him.\u201d Conservativedailynews.com. 1 Mar 2018.", "lang": "en"}
