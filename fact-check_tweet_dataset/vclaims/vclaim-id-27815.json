Hang this thief on town square.\u201d\n\nBut the meme is made up. It was created by a Facebook page belonging to a network of self-described sites known as America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. The Facebook page that originally shared the meme in December writes on its \u201cAbout\u201d page: \u201cNothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. You have been warned.\u201d\n\nHowever, the meme isn\u2019t labeled as satire, so once it is shared online there\u2019s no way to know it was made up.\n\nThe picture used in the meme, showing pallets full of gold bars, is from the Bank of England, which opened an exhibition in 2015 called \u201cDiscover Gold\u201d that shared some of the contents of its vault to visitors at the Bank of England Museum. It has nothing to do with the U.S. or Afghanistan.\n\nAlso, there is no \u201cTrump audit of Obama\u201d and there have been no reports of the U.S. transferring gold to Afghanistan. That claim, though, is reminiscent of Trump\u2019s criticism during the 2016 campaign of a $400 million payment that the Obama administration made as part of a legal settlement to reimburse Iran for the purchase of U.S. military equipment in the late 1970s that it never received.\n\nThe claim that the U.S. transferred gold to Afghanistan, however, is unfounded.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nAmerica Loves Donald Trump.
