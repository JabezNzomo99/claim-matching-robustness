The posts further claim hospital staff gifted Hanks the ball as a tribute to his character Chuck Noland in the 2000 film 'Cast Away', who \"befriends\" a volleyball. The claim is false; the image has been doctored using a 2015 photograph of Hanks and a stock photo of a hospital ward; the doctored photo emerged on a satirical website.\n\nThis photo was published on Twitter on March 12. It was been retweeted more than 1,300 times.\n\nThe caption states: \u201cTom Hanks has #Coronavirus He also has a cracking sense of humour.
