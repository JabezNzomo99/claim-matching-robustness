Send this video to everyone and make it viral. This teacher is from RM VM School. Share this video to an extent and the teacher and school both are shut.)\u201d\n\nAlt News has not hyperlinked Mevani\u2019s tweet (or any other tweet or website in this article) because of the graphic nature of the video. A screenshot of the Gujarat MLA\u2019s tweet is attached below.\n\nAfter a few people claimed that the video is from Egypt, Mevani quote-tweeted his earlier post and asked people to tell him if it\u2019s from Valsad or Egypt.\n\nWe found that the video has been also circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News broke the video into multiple frames and reversed-searched the images on the Russian search engine Yandex. We found several foreign websites carrying the same video last year. A Middle-Eastern online news portal Al-Masdar News published a report on the incident in February 2018. According to the media platform, \u201d A group of Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters kidnapped a nine-year-old boy that was travelling to his school in the eastern countryside of the Dara\u2019a Governorate last month [January 2018]\u2026Since the nine-year-old boy\u2019s kidnapping, the Free Syrian Army fighters have demanded the child\u2019s family pay a ransom of $1 million (USD) in exchange for securing their son\u2019s release.\u201d\n\nAl-Masdar News claimed that the video was sent by FSA rebels to the child\u2019s family.\n\nWe also found a tweet by a Syrian journalist Nedal Al-Amari who had shared the same video in February 2018 and said that it was sent by the kidnappers to the boy\u2019s family.\n\nThe video is, thus, not from India. This was also evident from the language that the child spoke. The same institution, RM VM School, was targetted with a child abuse video last year as well. A clip from Syria was falsely shared as children being thrashed by a teacher in the school.", "lang": "en"}
