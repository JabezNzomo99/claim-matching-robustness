Trump does not support equal pay legislation, but he has said that he believes in paying people based on performance, not gender.\n\nClinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, made her remarks in Ohio, in a speech critical of Trump\u2019s economic policies.\n\nHer campaign told us that Clinton was referring to a response that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, gave at an Oct. 12, 2015, town hall event, where a young woman challenged him on equal pay and abortion. The woman said, \u201cI want to get paid the same as a man,\u201d and asked will \u201ca woman make the same as a man\u201d if he is president. Trump responded, \u201cYou\u2019re going to make the same if you do as good a job.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign has made much of that quip, posting the quote on Twitter and on its website. But before and after that 13-word answer, Trump has given more expansive answers to questions about equal pay legislation that could best be described as a pro-business, free-market response favored by Republicans. Trump has said that he believes in paying people what they are worth, regardless of gender, without government involvement.\n\n\u201cIf they do the same job, they should get the same pay,\u201d Trump said nearly two months earlier in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nOn that show, Trump expressed skepticism that the government could construct a workable solution to pay inequity. According to the most recent Census Bureau data, a woman working full time, year-round, earned only 79 cents for every dollar earned by her male counterpart in 2014. (As we have pointed out before, that Census figure is the median for all women in all jobs, not for women doing the same job or even necessarily working the same number of hours.)\n\nTrump, Aug. 20, 2015: When you have to categorize men and women into a particular group and a particular pay scale, it gets very \u2014 because people do different jobs. If they do the same job, they should get the same pay. But it\u2019s very hard to say what is the same job. It\u2019s a very, very tricky question. And I talked about competition with other places and other parts of the world, Mika. This is one of the things that we have to look at very strongly.\n\nNine days before the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d interview, on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d Trump told host Chris Cuomo that the concept of equal pay legislation is \u201cgood,\u201d but implementing it would be \u201cvery complicated.\u201d Trump said, \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be a negative where everybody ends up making the same pay. That\u2019s not our system.\u201d\n\nCuomo, Aug. 11, 2015: You said I\u2019m going to be great for women. I will do the most that can be done for women. Will you pass an equal pay? You know the statistics. You know, they don\u2019t get paid what men do? Trump: I\u2019m looking into that very strongly. I was asked that question yesterday. I\u2019m looking into it very strongly. I will have a position on it in the not too distant future. One of the problems you have is you get to have an economy where it\u2019s no longer free enterprise economy. You know, everybody gets the saying whether the \u2014 the concept of it is good. It\u2019s a very complicated. The whole issue is a very complicated issue. \u2026 I\u2019m looking at that very strongly. I feel strongly \u2014 the concept of it, I love. I just don\u2019t want it to be a negative where everybody ends up making the same pay. That\u2019s not our system.\n\nIt was after those two interviews that Trump had an exchange with a woman who challenged his positions on abortion and equal pay. By that point, it was clear that Trump was skeptical of equal pay legislation, if not outright opposed to it.\n\nThe exchange occurred Oct. 12, 2015, in New Hampshire. It began with the woman telling Trump, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a friend to women.\u201d\n\nYoung woman, Oct. 12, 2015: I want to get paid the same as a man, and I think you understand that. So, if you become president, will a woman make the same as a man and do I get to choose what I do with my body? Trump: You\u2019re gonna make the same if you do as good a job. You\u2019re gonna make the same if you do as good a job, and I happen to be pro-life. OK? I\u2019m pro-life.\n\nTwo days later, Trump discussed his exchange with the woman and his views on equal pay with MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nBrzezinski, Oct. 14, 2015: I just wanted to know how you would make sure that\u2019s happening, because I understand equal work for equal pay. Trump: Well, you know, the marketplace is going to make sure of it, because I see it more and more. Women are being hired. And in fact, in many cases are being hired for more money than men based on their competence. And that\u2019s what I say. I mean, very I said it very clearly. If they do the job, I have women that make more than men executives. I have numerous women, many men \u2014 many men are unhappy because women in a similar position are making more than they are. And they work for me. They come to me and complain about it.\n\nAbout a month later, Trump equated equal pay legislation to socialism, and repeated that pay should be based on performance, not gender.\n\nTrump, Nov. 19, 2015: Here is the problem. If you start getting involved with government on \u201cthis one gets this pay and this one gets that pay,\u201d and then you say \u2014 \u201cWhere does it all start?\u201d Because you could have a woman that\u2019s much better than a man, or you could have a woman that\u2019s not as good as man, if you sorta say \u201ceverybody gets equal pay\u201d you get away from the whole American Dream. You get away from capitalism in a sense. I can tell you, that I have women, honestly that are just, in many cases, they\u2019re better than men and I pay them more than men. And to a certain extent, people have to go out there, they have to fight for themselves. \u2026 I don\u2019t know if people agree with me, once you get where everybody gets the same, I mean you\u2019re into a socialistic society.\n\nTrump does not support equal pay legislation, and that is a fair point of comparison for Clinton. But his position isn\u2019t as simple as Clinton makes it out to be.", "lang": "en"}
