But an image being shared on social media suggests authorities are taking this directive to an extreme.\n\n\"A California surfer was arrested for violating the state\u2019s stay-at-home order,\" reads the text over an image of what looks like two sheriff deputies walking a man in handcuffs down a beach. \"He was alone, in the ocean, when police violated social distancing protocols to arrest him, and potentially expose him to infection. This isn\u2019t about safety, it\u2019s about control!\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

On April 2, Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested a paddle boarder \u2014 not a surfer \u2014 on grounds he ignored lifeguards\u2019 orders to get out of the ocean near Malibu Pier for at least 30 minutes, the Times reports. Lifeguards contacted the deputies who responded by boat, according to the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\nIn video taken by bystanders and posted to Instagram it appears that the man was paddle boarding alone.\n\n\"The man, who was not identified by authorities, eventually made his way to the beach, where he was arrested on suspicion of disobeying a lifeguard and violating Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order, a misdemeanor,\" the story says.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department confirmed to PolitiFact that the man was arrested for violating a lifeguard\u2019s orders.\n\nBut Newsom\u2019s order says that it \"shall be enforceable pursuant to California law, including, but not limited to, Government Code section 8665.\" That law says that anyone who \"refuses or willfully neglects to obey any lawful order or regulation promulgated or issued as provided in this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a fine of not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by imprisonment for not to exceed six months or by both such fine and imprisonment.\"\n\nThe paddle boarder was booked at a sheriff\u2019s station and released on a promise to appear in court, according to the Times.\n\nOn its website, the California Department of Public Health advises that public health officials recommend social distancing \u2014 including maintaining approximately six feet away from other people \u2014 to slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19.\n\nThe Facebook post says a lone surfer in California was arrested for flouting the state\u2019s stay-at-home order. That\u2019s mostly right \u2014 it was a paddle boarder, not a surfer, out on the water at a beach that was closed to slow the spread of COVID-19. Authorities say he was arrested for disobeying a lifeguard and violating the state\u2019s restrictions.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
