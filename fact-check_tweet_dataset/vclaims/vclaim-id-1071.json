Here\u2019s what it looks like,\u201d reads the caption on a post showing the card that has been shared more than 8,900 times ( here ).\n\nExamples of other posts sharing the photo, which shows a debit card with the words \u2018ANTIFAmily\u2019 on it, can be seen here and here .\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has singled out Antifa, an amorphous movement of primarily leftist anti-authoritarians, as a major instigator of the current unrest in the country and said he will designate it as a terrorist organisation ( here ).\n\nThe spoof debit card shown in the posts is sold from a German website called Hooligans Gegen Satzbau ( here ).\n\nThe page advertising the card points to its satirical nature - the \u2018basic\u2019 card is said to come with a \u2018Satirefaction\u2019 guarantee while the \u2018platinum\u2019 version features an NFC (Nazis Fuckoff Chip).\n\nThe \u2018About\u2019 section of the Facebook page for Hooligans Gegen Satzbau also reads: \u2018ALLERGY WARNING: this site may contain traces of satire and irony\u2019.\n\nWhen asked for comment, Hooligans Gegen Satzbau told Reuters that the card was not linked to the antifa movement but \u201cto your own ANTIFA-Imagine-Account\u201d.\n\nFalse. The debit card pictured is meant as a joke and has no real link to the Antifa movement.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
