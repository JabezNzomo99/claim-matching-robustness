The video purports to show people voicing anti-Modi chants alongside a claim that it is evidence he received a bad reception from onlookers. The claim is false; the video has been manipulated to include the anti-Modi chants.\n\nThe 50-second video, which shows Modi walking alongside West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee, was shared on Facebook here on May 22, 2020. The video has since been viewed more than 397,000 times.\n\nAudio of people chanting \u201cchowkidar chor hai\u201d, which translates as \"the watchman is a thief\", can be heard throughout the video. The protest slogan was coined ahead of general elections 2019 by Rahul Gandhi, the former president of India\u2019s main opposition Indian National Congress (INC) party, in response to Modi portraying himself as India\u2019s watchman.\n\nThe video is also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here and here; and on Twitter here and here.\n\nA reverse Google image search using video keyframes extracted with InVID-WeVerify, a digital verification tool, found the video was doctored to include the protest audio.\n\nThe original footage was published here on May 22, 2020, on the Facebook page of the government-run regional news unit of All India Radio, Kolkata.\n\nThe video includes audio of people shouting religious slogans and \u201cdidi\u201d, which means sister and is a term of endearment for Chief Minister Banerjee. No anti-Modi slogans can be heard.\n\nAFP reported on Modi\u2019s visit to West Bengal on May 22, 2020 here.\n\nA further search found that the audio used in the misleading video shared on social media was taken from this YouTube video published in April 2019 by The Times of India, a major Indian daily newspaper. The footage shows INC supporters protesting against Modi, chanting \u201cchowkidar chor hai\u201d at a public rally.", "lang": "en"}
