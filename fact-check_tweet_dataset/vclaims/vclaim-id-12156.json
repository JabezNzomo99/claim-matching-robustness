This is also stated at the top of the \u201cabout\u201d section on the writer\u2019s blog.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "January 30, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-12156", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/pro-assad-blogger-discovers-venezuela-fact-check/29742431.html", "vclaim": "\u201cIn Venezuela\u201d (@invenezuelablog) is the Twitter account of a Venezuela news site by the same name authored by Giancarlo Fiorella, who also works as an investigator for the open source intelligence investigation organization Bellingcat.\n\nBut the name of the account didn\u2019t fool pro-Assad Syrian vlogger and commentator Maram Susli, who identifies herself as \u201cSyrian Partisan Girl\u201d despite living in Australia. Susli revealed that the account in question was actually based in Toronto, Canada and not Venezuela. She also alleged that the person behind the account was \u201cpretending\u201d to be in Venezuela when he wasn\u2019t.\n\nHow Did Susli expose this information? What investigative journalistic techniques did she use to determine that this account was in fact closer to Calgary than to Caracas? It appears she simply clicked on the account\u2019s main page, where it clearly gives its location as Toronto, Canada in the account\u2019s bio. Clicking on the link to the In Venezuela blog also gives access to an \u201cAbout\u201d page where it plainly states:\n\n\u201cMy name is Giancarlo Fiorella. I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto, where I am conducting research on protest policing in Venezuela. My research focuses on Venezuela\u2019s colectivos armados and the 2014/2017 anti-government protests. I am also an investigator and trainer for Latin America at Bellingcat.\u201d\n\nIf this was an attempt at deceiving audiences into thinking the blogger was actually located in Venezuela, it was poorly planned. But couldn\u2019t a visitor possibly mistake the site for a blog by someone in Venezuela? Not likely:- the front page displays what are obviously news stories from and about Venezuela. In fact, the about section clearly states this is the site\u2019s purpose:\n\n\u201cThis blog attempts to bring Venezuelan news and events to an English-speaking audience. Every day, I read through Venezuelan media and translate the day\u2019s biggest news into English.\u201d\n\nPartisan Girl is prominent on YouTube and Twitter, and has contributed to RT, Infowars, and the Iranian state channel Press TV, among other media. Apart from accusing the U.S. of orchestrating the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al Assad (in a YouTube video that now appears to be offline), she has also claimed that the CIA arms and funds al-Qaida and ISIS, and that 9/11 was a U.S. government false flag attack.", "lang": "en"}
