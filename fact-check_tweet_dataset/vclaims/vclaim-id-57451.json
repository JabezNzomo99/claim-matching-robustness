The Trump campaign says Biden only began calling for that on the same day \u2014 March 18 \u2014 that Trump said he was invoking the act. There\u2019s a bit of spin coming from both sides on this.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find evidence that Biden has been calling for use of the law for as long as he suggests, and Trump did not invoke the full force of the act back on March 18.\n\nWith the use of the Defense Production Act becoming a frequent point of contention between Trump and his critics, we thought it would be helpful to explain what the act is and how Trump has (and has not) applied it to date.\n\nWhat Is the Defense Production Act?\n\nFirst enacted in 1950 in response to the Korean War and last amended in 2018, the Defense Production Act provides the president broad authority to \u201cinfluence domestic industry in the interest of national defense,\u201d as a Congressional Research Service report put it in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe authorities can be used across the federal government to shape the domestic industrial base so that, when called upon, it is capable of providing essential materials and goods needed for the national defense,\u201d the CRS report states.\n\nThe law authorizes the president to identify businesses \u201ccapable\u201d of producing \u201cscarce and critical material\u201d to \u201crequire acceptance and performance\u201d of contracts to meet those needs. The act also allows the president to incentivize U.S. companies to expand production of critical materials with such things as \u201cloans, loan guarantees, direct purchases and purchase commitments, and the authority to procure and install equipment in private industrial facilities,\u201d the CRS report says.\n\nAs the New York Times reported, the law has been used hundreds of thousands of times during the Trump administration, \u201cespecially by the military to give its contract priority ratings to jump ahead of a vendor\u2019s other clients.\u201d The Times noted that in recent years, the administration has also used the powers contained in the act to restore power grids and to supply emergency food and water in areas devastated by hurricanes in 2017.\n\nOn Feb. 28, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar first signaled that the administration might use the Defense Production Act for the coronavirus to expedite contracts for medical supplies, such as face masks and gloves.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any procurements I need it for now, but if I need it, we\u2019ll use it,\u201d Azar said at a White House briefing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use it if we need to, but we, obviously, if we can work cooperatively with any vendor, we\u2019d rather do that,\u201d Azar said in a March 1 interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nOn March 13, 57 House Democrats wrote a letter urging the president to \u201cuse the powers afforded by the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a74501 et seq.) to begin the mass production of supplies needed to address the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe letter highlighted the likelihood of shortages of N95 respirators and face masks, testing equipment, and medical supplies like ventilators, and warned that \u201cfailure to act now\u201d could \u201cendanger American lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese authorities could be used to direct the domestic production of equipment currently in short supply, like personal protective equipment and ventilators,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThis would ensure we have the materials we need at the ready, rather than wait for disruptions in the global supply chain to subside.\n\n\u201cDuring World War II, our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers, tanks, and many small items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cWe know what the demands of this time are, and we must act now to meet these demands. We urge you to invoke the Defense Production Act without delay.\u201d\n\nFive days later, on March 18, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act \u201cjust in case we need it.\u201d But Trump stopped short of implementing the act to force production of certain goods. Later that day, Trump tweeted, \u201cI only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need.\u201d\n\nVia Twitter, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed the move as \u201can important step,\u201d but added, \u201cso much more is needed NOW.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Biden released a statement on \u201cimmediate actions\u201d he believed the Trump administration should take to address the pandemic. It called for Trump to \u201cPrioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis \u2014 such as the production of ventilators and associated training to operate \u2014 by invoking the Defense Production Act, delegating authority to HHS and FEMA. This action must be built on forecasted demand, using the best modeling currently available for negative scenarios.\u201d\n\nIn the following days, Trump said that he was reluctant to use the Defense Production Act to force corporations to make products, likening such a move to \u201cnationalizing our businesses.\u201d\n\nBesides, he said, companies were voluntarily stepping up with offers to produce masks, ventilators and other needed medical supplies and equipment.\n\nWe should note that compelling a company to produce supplies is not the same as \u201cnationalizing\u201d the business. Under the act, private businesses would be paid for their production and would remain private companies, not government entities.\n\nWhat Biden Said and When\n\nIn recent days, Biden has criticized Trump for failing to fully use the Defense Production Act, something he says Trump should have done weeks or even months ago. Biden has also cast himself as one of the earliest to call for it.\n\u2022 According to a March 22 pool report of a Biden phone call, the Democratic candidate \u201creiterated his call for the president to invoke the \u2018full power of the Defense Production Act\u2019 and noted he called for that a month ago.\u201d\n\u2022 In a YouTube speech on March 23, Biden said, \u201cAs of late yesterday, we\u2019re told that the president still has not activated the authority under the Defense Production Act, which I and others call for him to invoke immediately and act on, to direct American manufacturers to make essential supplies. Trump keeps saying that he\u2019s a wartime president, well start to act like one. \u2026 We need to get in motion. Get in motion today what we should have set in motion weeks ago.\n\u2022 \u201cI would have enacted it a long time ago, Jake,\u201d Biden told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on March 24. \u201cI think it was three \u2014 two, three weeks ago I pointed out that the president should enact this. It should have been enacted months ago.\u201d\n\u2022 During an online news conference the following day, Biden said, \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we understand that this idea of this Defense Production Act, he talks about signing, he doesn\u2019t want to dictate to companies. There\u2019s things we need now, now, not tomorrow, not yesterday, but months ago or a month ago, and the president\u2019s not acting.\u201d\n\u2022 And finally, on MSNBC on March 30, Biden said, \u201cI talked about doing the Defense Production Act before anyone came along.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign said that as far as it could tell, the first time Biden ever called for Trump to use the Defense Production Act was on March 18, the same day Trump invoked it (but did not use it to compel a company to start producing something).\n\nWe reached out to the Biden campaign for evidence that Biden had called for use of the Defense Production Act prior to that, but we got no response. We could not find any public comments from Biden prior to the statement he put out on March 18 \u2014 which we referenced earlier.\n\nPrior to March 18, we found instances of Biden talking generally, as he did on March 12, about the need to \u201csurge our capacity\u201d at hospitals, and make \u201csure communities have the hospital beds available, the staff, the medical supplies, the personal protective equipment necessary to treat the patient.\u201d\n\nBiden did not mention the Defense Production Act in the Democratic debate on March 15, where he encouraged viewers to see his full, detailed plan to combat COVID-19 on his campaign website. Nor does that plan, which was initially posted to the campaign website on March 12, mention the Defense Production Act.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan says only that the federal government should \u201c[w]ork with businesses to expand production of personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves, and additional products such as bleach and alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Incentivize greater supplier production of these critically important medically supplies, including committing, if necessary, to large scale volume purchasing and removing all relevant trade barriers to their acquisition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWork[ing] with businesses to expand production of personal protective equipment\u201d was essentially the Trump administration policy at the time.\n\nIf his first public call for Trump to use the Defense Production Act was March 18, Biden would have been exaggerating when he said on March 22 that he called for that a month before, or on March 24 when he said he made those calls \u201ctwo, three weeks ago.\u201d\n\nIt also would have been five days after 57 House members wrote to the president urging him to use the act, and two days after his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, publicly called on Trump \u201cto use existing emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to dramatically scale up production in the United States of critical supplies such as masks, ventilators, and protective equipment that our health care workers need.\u201d\n\nWe will update this story if the Biden campaign gets back to us with earlier examples.\n\nWe can say for sure, though, that Biden has repeatedly claimed to have issued a warning about the seriousness of the virus earlier than he actually did.\n\n\u201cAll of the way back in January 17, I wrote a piece for U.S. News & World Report saying, \u2018We have got a real problem. The president, we have \u2014 coronavirus is real. We have to start acting now,'\u201d Biden said in a March 24 interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\n\nThe op-ed he wrote was actually for USA Today, and it was published on Jan. 27, not Jan. 17. Those 10 days make a big difference. Biden\u2019s op-ed on Jan. 27 was just four days before the Trump administration announced travel restrictions on those who had traveled to China in the previous two weeks. Had Biden published that op-ed on Jan. 17, he would have been well ahead of the curve.\n\nWe would chalk up Biden\u2019s date mix-up to a simple misstatement, but he has cited that same incorrect date at least three other times since.\n\u2022 \u201cFor example, way back in January 17th I argued that this virus was coming. I did a, I think it was US News and World Report, I did a piece on saying it\u2019s coming. We\u2019ve got to prepare,\u201d Biden said in an online news conference on March 25\n\u2022 \u201cI wrote an article back in January 17th saying we should be prepared now and laid out the things that I thought we should be doing then,\u201d he said in a CNN town hall on March 27.\n\u2022 \u201cYou may recall, I was the first one to call for the president, way back in January 17th, to take this seriously,\u201d Biden said on March 30 on MSNBC. \u201cA real serious crisis is coming, an article I wrote.\u201d\n\nOn March 23, Trump signed a new executive order \u201cto prohibit the hoarding of needed resources,\u201d citing the authority given to him under the Defense Production Act. On March 30, federal authorities invoked that order when they charged a Brooklyn man for hoarding surgical masks, medical gowns and other medical supplies that authorities said he was selling at inflated prices from his home.\n\nDespite his early reluctance to employ the Defense Production Act to compel businesses to make supplies necessary for the COVID-19 response, Trump said in a March 27 press conference that he had invoked the act \u201cto compel General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators.\u201d\n\nTrump also tapped Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, to act as national Defense Production Act policy coordinator. At the press conference, Navarro explained that the Defense Production Act was employed to compel General Motors to make ventilators only after the federal government \u201cran into roadblocks\u201d in its negotiations with GM over production.\n\nNavarro, March 27: We need industrial mobilization to make adequate ventilators, particularly in the very short run, to help people of New York, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, all around this country, as this virus bears down. And the ventilators really are the most important thing for patients who become most seriously ill. They\u2019re literally the lifeline for people. And I\u2019ve personally been working with FEMA, and I\u2019ve been working with HHS and over 10 ventilator companies, making sure we can get what we need as quickly as possible. And virtually every one of those companies has been cooperative, patriotic, moving in Trump time \u2014 which is to say as soon as possible, sir. But we did have a problem with GM and Ventec. On the one hand, we had Ford and GE moving forward on a similar kind of project, patriotically moving as fast as possible. Over the last several days, we ran into roadblocks with GM. We cannot afford to lose a single day, particularly over the next 30 to 60 days. So President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act as a way of enhancing and accelerating this mobilization.\n\nIn an interview on CNN on March 31, Biden said Trump\u2019s action was too slow, and too limited.\n\nBiden is entitled to his opinion that the president acted slowly and \u201cstill hasn\u2019t fully invoked the Defense Production Act.\u201d But we could find no evidence that Biden called for the president to use the act prior to March 18, despite his repeated claims that he had done so much earlier.", "lang": "en"}
