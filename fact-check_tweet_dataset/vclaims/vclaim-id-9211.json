But he is the first person to have won two Olympic golds in the singles.\n\nIronically, we discovered in the course of researching this article that the official Olympic website has incorrect or missing information on several medallists. We recommend the International Tennis Federation website or the relevant Wikipedia entry instead.\n\nAndy Murray first won a gold medal in the men\u2019s singles at the London 2012 Olympics. Yesterday he added another men\u2019s singles gold to his collection with victory in Rio.\n\nBy doing this, he became the first person to successfully defend an Olympic singles title and the first man to win back-to-back golds.\n\nVenus and Serena Williams have a lot more than two gold medals\n\nAs Mr Murray pointed out, American tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams have won four Olympic gold medals each. Six of these were for their efforts in the women\u2019s doubles. They first won the doubles at Sydney in 2000, before going on to win the gold back-to-back at the Beijing Games in 2008 and again at London 2012.\n\nVenus also won the women\u2019s singles gold medal in 2000 and Serena won it in 2012.\n\n20 people in total have won multiple golds in tennis at the Olympics\n\nSpain\u2019s Rafael Nadal has also won two golds, though in different events. The first was in the men\u2019s singles at Beijing in 2008, the second in the men\u2019s doubles last Friday\u2014two days before Mr Murray\u2019s win.\n\nThe same is true of Nicolas Massu who won two golds for Chile at the Athens Olympics in 2004 in the men\u2019s doubles and men\u2019s singles.\n\nGigi Fern\u00e1ndez and Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez of the USA won back-to-back golds in the women\u2019s doubles at the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics in 1992 and 1996.\n\nThat\u2019s a total of seven people who have won multiple tennis gold medals in the modern era.\n\nLooking slightly further back in tennis\u2019s Olympic history, a further 13 achieved this feat when the sport was first on the roster between 1896 and 1924.\n\nReginald Doherty of the United Kingdom won the men\u2019s and mixed doubles gold medals at the Paris Olympics in 1900. He then won the men\u2019s doubles gold again in 1908.\n\nHis brother Hugh Lawrence Doherty won the doubles with him in 1900 and also took the men\u2019s singles gold at the same Olympics. Reginald reportedly pulled out of the semi-final to let his younger brother go through.\n\nSteffi Graf won back-to-back Olympic singles golds, but one wasn\u2019t included in the medals tally\n\nEven when it comes to Olympic gold medals, the answer depends on what you count.\n\nSteffi Graf won back-to-back singles golds for West Germany at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 and again in Seoul in 1988. However, in 1984 tennis was only an \u2018exhibition sport\u2019 so it wasn't included in the official medal tally.\n\nRafael Osuna of Spain also won three Olympic golds at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City when tennis was again an exhibition sport. He won two separate golds in men\u2019s doubles and also took the singles title.\n\nAltogether, an extra seven people would be included as multiple gold winners in tennis if their Olympic \u2018exhibition\u2019 wins were counted.\n\nTennis was to return as an official medal sport in 1988 after a 64-year absence from the Olympics, and has been included ever since.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Olympians, Paralympians have won multiple golds too\n\nA number of people have won multiple gold medals in wheelchair tennis at the Paralympics.\n\nEsther Vergeer of the Netherlands holds the record with seven medals. Four of these have been for the women\u2019s singles which she won at every games from 2000 to 2012.\n\nShingo Kunieda of Japan, Maaike Smit of the Netherlands and David Wagner of the USA have all won three gold medals each. A further seven Paralympians have won two gold medals each at various Paralympics since the sport was first introduced in 1992, including Great Britain\u2019s Peter Norfolk.", "lang": "en"}
