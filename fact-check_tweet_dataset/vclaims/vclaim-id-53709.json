The claim is false: the photo shows a temporary road constructed in two months after a Japanese highway was damaged by a landslide in July 2018.\n\nThe photo was published in this Facebook post on October 14, 2019.\n\nIt has been shared 50 times.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cAn emergency bridge was built within 24 hours as the highway was blocked by a landslide. This incident happened after a typhoon hit Japan. Constructing a bridge only in 24 hours, amazing.\n\nThe English text superimposed on the image states: \u201cEmergency road constructed in Japan within 24 hours so as to maintain flow of traffic after the main one was being covered by landslide.\n\n\u201cHow many hours will this be fixed in your own country?\u201d\n\nTyphoon Hagibis hit Japan on October 12, 2019, triggering landslides and floods. At least 74 people were killed and dozens remain missing, according to this AFP report.\n\nThe image was also published in Facebook posts here, here and here, as well as in Twitter here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe same image with a claim that the road was constructed within 24 hours but not related to recent typhoon also appeared in Facebook posts in English here, here and here, where it has been shared more than 6,000 times.\n\nIt is also shared alongside a similar claim in Arabic here and here, as well as in Khmer here and here.\n\nThe claim is false. The image shows a temporary road constructed in the two months after a landslide damaged a highway in Fukui city, Japan, in July 2018.\n\nA reverse image search for the image in the misleading post on Yandex followed by subsequent keyword search found this image of the temporary road published in a tweet on March 22, 2019.\n\nThe caption of the post says that the road was a national highway in Fukui city.\n\nBelow is the screenshot comparison between the image in the misleading post (L) and the image posted on Twitter (R):\n\nThe same Twitter user also posted a video of cars travelling along the road here.\n\nFukui city is the capital of Fukui prefecture.\n\nNational Route 305 in Ikura-cho, Fukui city, was damaged by a landslide which was triggered by heavy rain hitting west Japan in July 2018. A temporary road was subsequently constructed, according to a report by Japanese media Fukui Shimbun on October 27, 2018, here.\n\nFukui Shimbun also published this report on November 1, 2018, stating that the construction of the temporary road had been completed and was open to the public.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a photo of the road in the report:\n\nThe construction of the temporary road was completed within two months from August 27, 2018, to October 31, 2018, according to this local government document, praising the local officials in charge of the construction.\n\nThe new section of National Route 305 is located here on Google Maps, but Google Street View only shows the area as it was in 2017.\n\nThe map is embedded below:", "lang": "en"}
