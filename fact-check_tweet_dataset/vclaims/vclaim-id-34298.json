The Brexit Party confirmed to us that its pledge is that corporation tax would be waived for the first \u00a310,000 of pre-tax profits, not the first \u00a310,000 of tax owed.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen figures to show exactly how many companies have profits less than \u00a310,000. A company with profits of \u00a310,000 would normally pay \u00a31,900 in corporation tax.\n\nThe available statistics show that 279,780 companies paid less than \u00a31,000 in 2017/18 and 713,590 companies paid less than \u00a35,000. So the number who will have profits of less than \u00a310,000 will be somewhere between, and so fewer than half of the 1.5 million companies have profits of less than \u00a310,000.", "lang": "en"}
