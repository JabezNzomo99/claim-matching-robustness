This is false: Maduro was never certified on those platforms, and Guaido was already certified before Wednesday, according to an AFP investigation confirmed by an Instagram spokesperson.\n\nShortly after Guaido proclaimed himself \u201cacting president,\u201d messages were widely shared, particularly in Spanish, noting the withdrawal of Maduro\u2019s certification.\n\nThis widely shared tweet proclaimed, \u201cBreaking: Facebook and Instagram have removed Venezuelan Dictator Nicolas Maduro\u2019s verification sign.\u201d\n\nPhotojournalist Andrews Abreu also shared the information on Twitter, referring to Maduro\u2019s Facebook page, before posting a correction tweet several hours later. His tweet was relayed by American journalist Michael Moynihan.\n\nMany users believed the news and it was picked up by major Spanish-language media such as Colombian television channel RCN.\n\n\n\nThe information was also shared in English and Portuguese. It was, for example, amplified by Glenn Greenwald, the journalist behind revelations about the NSA, who took to Twitter to ironically (but mistakenly) accuse Facebook of \u201cpatriotically following Trump administration pronouncements.\u201d\n\nThe information could also be found on French sites such as Loop Ha\u00efti, and also on Facebook pages including L'Obs.\n\nIn reality, Maduro\u2019s verification could not have been withdrawn because his Instagram and Facebook pages were not verified in the first place.\n\nThanks to the internet archive tool the Wayback Machine, a site that allows users to view older versions of web pages, it\u2019s possible to see that Maduro\u2019s Instagram account was not verified as far back as October 6, 2017. This is also seen through a Google Images search.\n\nThe situation is the same for Facebook: Maduro was not verified, as seen in this screenshot from January 22, 2019.\n\nThis screenshot of past tweets, dating from 2016 and 2017, also shows that Maduro was not verified on Facebook.\n\nThe result of a Google Images search is the same.\n\nAFP was unable to obtain archived snapshots of Juan Guaido\u2019s accounts.\n\n\"Nicolas Maduro was not verified on Instagram or Facebook, and we did not remove verification from his account,\" an Instagram spokeswoman confirmed to AFP. \"Juan Guaido was verified on Instagram in November 2018, and he was verified on Facebook more recently.\"", "lang": "en"}
