It was PhilHealth ex-board member Roberto Salvador who named the members of a \u201cmafia\u201d inside the institution. Salvador clarified, however, that the individuals he named were not involved in criminal activities, just that they have \u201cinfluence.\u201d\n\nSecond, there was no mention of Hontiveros being part of the said \u201cmafia.\u201d The senator is no longer a board member of PhilHealth, having served from November 2014 to October 2015.\n\nHontiveros, often a target of disinformation online, was falsely tagged in 2018 as one of the officials of PhilHealth who ordered the grant of unauthorized bonuses to employees in 2009, 2010, and 2014. She was not yet a member of the board when the controversial bonuses were approved for release. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Online posts claiming Hontiveros involved in PhilHealth bonuses mess FALSE)\n\nThe misleading video made the rounds on the internet a day after Go called for a settlement of the row between PhilHealth and the Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines, Inc. (PHAPi), as the latter demanded the health insurance institution to pay the unsettled claims of its member hospitals.\n\nIt was already viewed 153,000 times and could have reached around a million netizens. Its top traffic generators are public Facebook groups DUTERTE PARA SA BAYAN! and DUTERTE MARCOS SUPPORTERS, as well as Facebook page Status Pilipinas.\n\n(Editor's Note:VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
