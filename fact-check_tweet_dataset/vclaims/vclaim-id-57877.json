Whereas the viral screenshot reads 11:33 PM.\n\nAlso, the Rafale jet crash would have made headlines given the importance of the news but we did not find a single credible media report on this.\n\nHence, from the above fact check it is clear that the viral claim is fake.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
