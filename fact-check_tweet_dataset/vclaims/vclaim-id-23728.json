They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!\u201d\n\nThat tweet is paired with the quote attributed to Jefferson in the image. However, there is no evidence that Jefferson actually spoke or wrote these words.\n\nThe expression is included in a list of spurious quotations from Jefferson\u2019s estate at Monticello and does not appear in a collection of Jefferson\u2019s writings.\n\n\u201cThis quotation has not been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson,\u201d Monticello says on its website. \u201cIts earliest known appearance to date is a meme generated in late February 2017.\u201d\n\nWhile this exact quotation cannot be traced to Jefferson, he did support the freedom of the press. In a letter to statesman John Jay in 1786, Jefferson wrote that liberty \u201ccannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that be limited without danger of losing it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
