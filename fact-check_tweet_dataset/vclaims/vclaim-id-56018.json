HBO Max, for instance, briefly pulled \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d to add a disclaimer about how the movie portrayed slavery. Netflix also removed content that featured characters done up in blackface.\n\nWhile there were some changes to movies and television shows in June 2020 due to their use of blackface or other racist stereotypes, there have not been any widespread efforts to remove Van Dyke from \u201cMary Poppins.\u201d One reason for this may be because Van Dyke\u2019s character\u2019s face is covered in soot, and this is not \u2014 at least not explicitly \u2014 a racist caricature:\n\nWhile this rumor originated from a satire website, and there have not been a widespread calls to have Van Dyke removed from \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d some academics have labeled this scene problematic for being a \u201cparody of black menace:\u201d\n\nFor background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.", "lang": "en"}
