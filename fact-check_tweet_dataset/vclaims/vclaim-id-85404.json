A reader questioned the assertion made by Sen. Ben Sasse that the national debt is really more like $70 trillion to $75 trillion, rather than the more commonly used figure of $19 trillion. Here\u2019s the key moment in the discussion, which you can see was somewhat rowdy, though Sasse handled himself well. He was attempting to answer a question about proposed cuts in arts funding.\n\nThe Treasury Department has a website that provides the national debt up to the penny. It lists three figures \u2014 debt held by the public (about $14.35 trillion on April 13, 2017), intragovernmental holdings ($5.49 trillion) and total public debt outstanding ($19.85 trillion). Intragovernmental holdings include items such as the Social Security Trust Funds, which hold U.S. Treasury securities that can be redeemed at some point to pay benefits. (For more, see our guide to understanding Social Security.)\n\nJames Wegmann, a spokesman for Sasse, said he was drawing on several sources to come up with a ballpark figure. The Treasury Department, in a 2016 report, said that the projected expenditures for scheduled benefits for social insurance programs would exceed projected revenue by $46.7 trillion. Adding to it the gross debt of $19 trillion yields a figure of $66 trillion. Over an infinite horizon, Treasury said, total resources for Social Security and Medicare amounted to $90.5 trillion in present value terms. Wegmann said Sasse was taking a number between those values to make a broader point.\n\nSome of these obligations, such as FDIC guarantees, do not pose significant risks to taxpayers, Hamilton said. \u201cOther programs, such as the federal government\u2019s big role in lending for housing and education, have less clear benefits and have been associated with more tangible costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest off-balance-sheet liabilities come from recognition of the fiscal stress that will come in the form of an aging population and rising medical expenditures.\u201d\n\nHamilton noted that at times, such as during the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, off-balance-sheet obligations ended up costing Americans real money. The United States had to honor $124 billion in off-balance-sheet commitments when the savings and loan industry collapsed. The situation has been even more dramatic in other countries. Ireland had a very strong financial position, on paper, before the Great Recession. But the Irish then had to inject the equivalent of 45 percent of their GDP to rescue the banking system, sending the country\u2019s debt from 25 percent of GDP to over 100 percent.\n\nSo Sasse is correct to highlight implicit liabilities that are larger than the official debt. He gets into a bit of trouble by suggesting $70 trillion is \u201cthe real number,\u201d as these figures do not represent actual debt instruments. These are potential obligations, but as Sasse well knows, Congress is able to change future Social Security and Medicare benefits, as it has in the past. Indeed, Sasse himself has proposed to gradually index the age of eligibility and means-testing benefits, which would reduce future obligations.\n\nBut Wegmann said that Sasse\u2019s reference to $70 trillion to $75 trillion was parenthetical. \u201cSasse starts with a conversation of debt to GDP, interrupts to make a point about the off-books debt we\u2019ve discussed, and then comes back to debt to GDP,\u201d he said, noting that Sasse misspoke when he made a reference to the highest level being on the eve of the Great Depression. \u201cHe probably should have said World War II.\u201d\n\nThe gross debt-to-GDP ratio did peak right after World War II, to nearly 120 percent, and then declined steadily to about 30 percent until the Ronald Reagan administration. The debt ratio soared until a brief period of balanced budgets under Bill Clinton. Then the Great Recession sent the debt-to-GDP ratio skyrocketing. As the charts below show, the ratio more or less has plateaued around 100 percent in the last few years of the Obama administration but still has not been reduced from its post-recession high \u2014 unlike the period immediately following World War II.\n\nThe senator was correct to note that arts funding is not a major factor in the debt, compared to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which have long-term obligations that could total $70 trillion to $75 trillion. But he was a bit misleading when he called those obligations \u201cthe real number,\u201d when in fact those obligations can be reduced if Congress takes action. So it\u2019s not really the same as the Treasury securities now traded on Wall Street, or even the bonds in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n\nSasse should have spoken more clearly and explained he was talking about anticipated costs over a 75-year or infinite period, not debt held by bondholders. That would have allowed him to speak more clearly about the unusually high debt-to-GDP ratio for the United States. It\u2019s an important point to raise, and will be solved either by a booming economy or tough choices about reducing federal spending or boosting federal revenue.", "lang": "en"}
