Is this a real video?\n\nWhether the women seen in the video below were using illegally obtained EBT cards to purchase food items for resale.\n\nThe owner of a deli was arrested for buying up other people's EBT food stamp cards and using them to purchase items to resell at his store.\n\nOn 29 September 2016 the Facebook page Vidmax.com shared a video and a post alleging that a Muslim woman had been filmed committing food stamp (i.e., Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) fraud by using her SNAP benefits to purchase a large quantity of soda with the intent of reselling it to others at her store:\n\nThe web site 100% Fed Up reshared the clip and reiterated a claim that the woman committed food stamp fraud, purporting that she \u201cblatantly admit[ted] to\u201d it in the footage:\n\nAlthough the video was widely shared, many social media users might not have watched the entire clip to determine whether any of the claims were evidenced in its content. The footage begins with a woman unloading a grocery cart full of soda into her vehicle, and the unseen man recording the clip shouts that she \u201ctakes our tax money,\u201d \u201cbuys a bunch of pop,\u201d and \u201csell[s] it at [her] gas station.\u201d He then tells individuals off-camera (presumably bystanders) that the woman depicted bought \u201call that pop on food stamps\u201d to sell at her store. The location of the depicted confrontation was not apparent\n\nThe woman bristles at the man\u2019s allegations, leading to the following primary exchange:\n\nWOMAN: \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do with my card.\u201d WOMAN: \u201cHow is it fraud? Because I went in there and bought all this pop for myself? That\u2019s stereotyping!\u201d MAN: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to where you came from, then?\u201d WOMAN: \u201c[laughs] Detroit? I was born in Detroit \u2026 why don\u2019t you go where you came from? You\u2019re not Native American \u2026 you go back to your country \u2026 Fuck out of here.\u201d\n\nThe man then records an image of her vehicle\u2019s registration sticker (for a 2000 Lexus) and again warns her she will \u201cget deported.\u201d While the clip\u2019s unseen narrator records and publishes the woman\u2019s vehicle registration, he himself never provides his name, location, or any other information about his identity or purpose in following and interrogating the depicted woman. The clip ends abruptly and consists of little more than bickering between a woman shopping at a store and a man who followed her to her vehicle at night to record her and publish the results online. During the exchange the woman laments the footage is \u201calready viral,\u201d apparently aware that her visual appearance coupled with his accusation assured that the clip would (as it did) become immensely popular on social media.\n\nAlthough the clip was widely touted as footage of a \u201cMuslim woman caught using food stamps to fraudulently buy soda to sell in her store,\u201d almost no part of any of the claim was verified or verifiable from the clip (save for the ostensible fact the depicted individual was female). Nothing in the video itself demonstrated how the off-screen narrator knew that woman had used SNAP benefits exclusively to purchase the soda, or knew that she was planning to resell the soda at a \u201cgas station.\u201d The woman in the video also didn\u2019t \u201cblatantly admit\u201d to anything, other than referencing the use of food stamps a few times (possibly with the intent of irritating whoever was filming her).\n\nHowever, a few days after this video went viral, the owner of a Buffalo deli was arrested on charges that he had been buying up other people\u2019s EBT food stamp cards and using them to purchase items to resell at his store:\n\nAhmed Alshami, 37, is charged with criminal possession of public benefit cards, misuse of food stamps and criminal use of a public benefit card for defrauding the welfare system. Alshami is the owner and operator of IGA Express Mart, a corner deli at 271 Ludington in the City of Buffalo. According to the Erie County District Attorney\u2019s Office, between October 9, 2014 and March 21, 2016 Alshami is accused of buying EBT (food stamp) cards from people willing to trade them for cash. He usually paid people half of what the cards are worth. It is alleged that Alshami would use the food stamps to buy items to be sold in his store. I\n\n\n\nAlshami\u2019s wife, captured by television cameras at a court hearing, appears to be the same woman as the one seen in the above video:\n\nIt\u2019s still unknown at this point whether the woman seen in the video above was in fact using illegally obtained EBT cards to purchase food items for resale at another retail establishment. As of this writing, Alshami\u2019s wife has not been charged with a crime.\n\nThe buying of other people\u2019s EBT food stamp cards is a crime, regardless of what use is made of those cards.", "lang": "en"}
