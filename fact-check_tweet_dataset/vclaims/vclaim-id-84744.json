She lost her cool because she missed her flight. Since she assaulted a government official on duty even her bail has been rejected. She now has three years in jail to cool down her temper.\n\nThe woman in the video, identified as Auj-E-Taqqadas, is a British national of Pakistani origin. BOOM had debunked the same video when it was viral last year with a similar narrative. Taqqadas, who was headed to Singapore, was detained, for overstaying her visa by 160 days. The video shows an angry and abusive Taqqadas shouting at the immigration officer.", "lang": "en"}
