Take care of yourself, as long as you are safe, your God is also safe!! Man\u2019s existence is not because of God, but the existence of the imaginary God is because of the human being!! It is a request to the devotees to please think, understand and then believe!!\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the claim to be false.\n\nOn putting the picture through Reverse Image Search on various search engines we found a Facebook post dated July 27, 2019, featuring a video from a religious event.\n\nWe ran a keyword search and found a link to a post on a Russian social media website \u2013 VK (VKontakte), featuring pictures from the same event.\n\nDevotees believe Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Nityananda Prabhu, Advaita Acahrya, Gadadhara Pandit, and Srivasa Thakura are the Panchatattva or Five Truths. They incarnated as five people and propagated the Hare Krishna mantra and the practice of devotion to Lord Krishna.\n\nFrom the above information, it is clear that the picture has no relation to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and is being circulated with mischievous intent.\n\nHence, the viral claim is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
