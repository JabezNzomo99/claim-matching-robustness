Further articles followed on 6, 10, 11, 17, 22, 24 and 31 December and continued on 2 January.\n\nThis is to say nothing of its coverage on TV or radio.\n\nOther British media outlets, including The Daily Mail, The Guardian and The Sun have all published articles on the strike action.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s a matter of opinion as to whether strikes in France are newsworthy enough to deserve more coverage, but it\u2019s certainly not the case that the BBC and British media have ignored them completely.", "lang": "en"}
