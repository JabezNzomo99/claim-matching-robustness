The claims are misleading; police confirmed that a priest was robbed but said there was no indication he was targeted by protesters or because of his profession.\n\n\u201cFr Thomas Haake of Washington DC was brutally attacked last night simply for being a Catholic priest,\u201d says a June 28, 2020 Facebook post shared more than 80,000 times. It included a photo of a man wearing a priest\u2019s collar, with bruising around his eye and on his face.\n\nThe post did not suggest who was responsible but said, \u201cthe assault has begun on priests.\u201d\n\nAnother post on Instagram a day earlier, which described Haake as \u201cmy friend,\u201d blamed an unnamed \u201cmovement\u201d for assaulting him.\n\nLiked more than 16,000 times, it was the first reference to the attack, a search using the CrowdTangle social media analysis tool showed.\n\n\u201cIt was a crime motivated by hatred and malfeasance,\u201d said the post, which did not elaborate on which \u201cmovement\u201d it blamed.\n\nSome social media users, however, accused Black Lives Matter, which has gained broad support since the May 25 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a death that sparked weeks of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality.\n\n\u201cFr. Thomas Haake was assaulted by #BLM in the streets of Washington #DC while praying his Rosary,\u201d one tweet said.\n\nAnother claimed: \u201cBLM DID THIS TO THIS 80 year old Catholic priest dressed in his cassock & collar.\u201d\n\nA few, including this Facebook post, claimed it was a racial hate crime.\n\nBut police say this is inaccurate.\n\n\u201cRight now it is not being investigated as a hate-bias crime,\u201d Kristen Metzger, deputy director of the Metropolitan Police Department office of communications, told AFP by telephone on July 6.\n\nHate-bias would include being targeted because he was a priest, she said.\n\nAs for claims that BLM was involved, Metzger said: \u201cWe don't have any information at this time to suggest that.\u201d\n\nAccording to a police report obtained on July 3, Haake said he was walking on the John Philip Sousa Bridge at about 6:15 am on June 9 when \u201che fell to the ground and hit his face on the sidewalk.\u201d Haake later woke up to find his right eye swollen and his wallet and cell phone missing, the report said, listing the items as stolen.\n\nIt said Haake was taken to hospital after the robbery, which was committed with \u201cpersonal weapons\u201d, such as hands or feet.\n\nBlack Lives Matter has been targeted by online disinformation, including the false claim that it issued \u201crules\u201d for white protesters, which AFP Fact Check has debunked.\n\nThe robbery occurred in Washington\u2019s Ward 7 which, along with a neighboring ward, had the most violent crimes in the city over the past two years.\n\nPolice data accessed on July 5 showed that, in the month prior, there were four robberies and one assault with a dangerous weapon in the immediate area where Haake was robbed.\n\nIn a July 2 email to AFP, the Archdiocese of Washington said it was \u201cunable to confirm the facts\u201d due to Haake's request for privacy.\n\n\u201cHe has declined interviews at this this time because he is in the midst of the ongoing investigation by DC Police,\u201d wrote Emma Restuccia, the archdiocese manager of media relations.\n\nShe described Haake as a member of the Oblates of the Virgin Mary, \u201ca visiting priest serving in the Archdiocese of Washington for a few months.\u201d\n\nAFP visited the Catholic residence where Haake lived, roughly a mile from the scene of the attack, but was told he was no longer there and was staying elsewhere \u201cwith the church.\u201d\n\nErnest Bengtson, 52, who is not a priest but who lives at the residence, told AFP that Haake had recounted to him what happened.\n\nAs he walked across the bridge in the early morning \u201cthere were guys who were passing by\u201d on motorbikes or scooters, \u201cpassing back and forth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd then they came up behind him and they knocked him down, took, you know, his wallet and all that stuff,\u201d Bengtson said.\n\n\u201cHe just takes these long walks in the morning and he prays as he walks,\u201d Bengtson said, confirming Haake is the man pictured in social media posts.\n\n\u201cThis was not anything in the way of a hate crime. Period. It was just street crime.\u201d\n\nHave you seen content that you would like AFP USA to verify?", "lang": "en"}
