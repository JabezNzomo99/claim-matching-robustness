It includes the message, \u201cPlease STAY AT HOME\u201d.\n\nThe post claims that the total number of deaths in Italy rose from 233 to 4,032 within two weeks, and there are currently 233 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK.\n\nThe cumulative number of deaths from Covid-19 reported by the Department of Civil Protection in Italy rose from 233 on 7 March to 4,032 on 20 March (the day before the Facebook post was published). On 21 March, Public Health England (PHE) reported that there had been 233 deaths in total from Covid-19. (PHE does not provide a public record of deaths by day, but there are unofficial collections of this data gathered from PHE\u2019s public releases.)\n\nThe post also claims that there were 647 deaths in Italy in the last 24 hours. This is slightly higher than the official statistics from Italy, which reported 627 additional deaths between 19 and 20 March.\n\nItaly, to date, has had the highest number of deaths from Covid-19\n\nOn 19 March, Italy\u2019s death count from Covid-19 surpassed China\u2019s, making it the country with the highest number of deaths.\n\nAs the pandemic is ongoing, it is hard to know exactly why Italy has been affected so badly by the new coronavirus (or whether other countries will ultimately surpass Italy\u2019s death count).\n\nHowever, Italy\u2019s ageing population, as well as its culture of connectedness between generations, have been proposed as reasons for such a high number of deaths.\n\nItaly has a greater percentage of over 65s in its population than any other country in Europe, according to data published by the UN. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions \u201care at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness\u201d.\n\nIs the UK on track to have the same high number of deaths as Italy?\n\nThe overall message of the Facebook post is that the UK will end up with a situation like Italy if the UK public does not stay at home and stop the spread of the virus.\n\nIn a speech on 21 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that \u201cthe Italian death toll is already in the thousands and climbing. Unless we act together, unless we make the heroic and collective national effort to slow the spread\u2014then it is all too likely that our own NHS will be similarly overwhelmed\u201d.\n\nA graph of the total number of deaths in Italy and the UK, with the UK on a two-week delay, shows that the two countries have been on a roughly similar trajectory since just before they recorded their first deaths.\n\nHowever, several experts, including Professor David Spiegelhalter from Cambridge University\u2019s Statistical Laboratory (quoted in a Guardian article discussing the same issue), have emphasised the difficulty in drawing accurate conclusions about Covid-19 deaths in the UK based on what is known in other countries. Differences in the number of people who are tested for the new coronavirus and how deaths are recorded limits the comparability of published data across countries.\n\nVariation in health systems and demographics of populations, such as age structure, rates of underlying illnesses and health behaviours, may contribute to differences in the number of deaths.\n\nPolicy on social isolation and the public response to it will also play a role in the spread of the virus and the resulting number of deaths. Professor Spiegelhalter notes this importance: \u201cthe UK\u2019s peak may not be so severe if the UK\u2019s response to the outbreak has been effective\u201d, but also warns that \u201cthe answer to that is not yet clear.\u201d\n\nAs stated by Dr James Gill, Honorary Clinical Lecturer at Warwick Medical School, \u201cwhat we must ensure though is that countries learn from and adapt with one another when effective strategies are demonstrated.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
