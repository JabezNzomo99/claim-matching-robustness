This is false; the photo has been edited to show the inauguration on the TV screen. The original photo shows Atiku watching a football match last year.\n\nThe doctored photo was posted on Facebook by Mustapha Maigonjo, a supporter of Buhari, on Wednesday and has been shared more than 4,500 times. We\u2019ve archived it here. Another post showing the same edited picture has been shared over 2,300 times, with many commenters believing it was a genuine photo was taken on Wednesday, during the inauguration.\n\nThe same picture has been shared by numerous accounts on Twitter, including this tweet in pidgin English making a joke at the expense of Atiku\u2019s supporters.\n\nWe ran a reverse image search on Google, which revealed that the original picture was first posted on Atiku\u2019s official Twitter handle in February 2018. It shows him watching the finals of the African Nations Championship, played in Casablanca. Morocco defeated Nigeria 4-0 to win the trophy, as reported here by the Nigerian Football Federation.\n\nAtiku Abubakar was the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23, 2019 presidential election in Nigeria. He was defeated by sitting President Muhammadu Buhari, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), by nearly four million votes.\n\nAtiku did not accept the outcome of the poll, and is challenging Buhari\u2019s victory at the election petition tribunal. Read the full AFP story here.\n\nWhile Atiku was not able to stop Buhari taking office as president for a second term, the image being shared on social media is not a genuine photo of the runner-up watching the inauguration, as claimed by some of Buhari\u2019s supporters.", "lang": "en"}
