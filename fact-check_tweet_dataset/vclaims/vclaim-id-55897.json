But this supposed tweet from U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is not a smoking gun. Because she didn\u2019t actually tweet it.\n\nIt looks like she did, though, in an image being shared on Facebook. \"She deleted it but not before it was shared over 20,000 times,\" reads a description of the tweet.\n\nThe tweet itself says: \"It\u2019s vital that Governors (sic) maintain restrictions on businesses until after the November Elections because economic recovery will help Trump be re-elected. A few business closures or job losses is a small price to pay to be free from his presidency. #KeepUsClosed.\" The post in the image is dated May 20, 2020.\n\nThe Facebook post sharing the image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe found no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez tweeted this.\n\nProPublica, which keeps an archive of deleted tweets, does not have it in its collection of deleted tweets from either of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Twitter accounts. We also didn\u2019t find the tweet searching those accounts on Twitter.\n\nLastly, we couldn\u2019t find any news coverage corroborating this Facebook post \u2014 which, again, was allegedly from May. Ocasio-Cortez is a highly scrutinized elected official and if she said something as inflammatory as what appears in the post, it would have been widely reported.If you Google the quote, the top hit is a Snopes fact-check saying the quote is fabricated. Because it is.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
