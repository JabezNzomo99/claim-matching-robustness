Google translate detects the words as Samoan, but it does not provide an English translation.\n\nOur crack team of researchers at PolitiFact pondered what Trump may have been typing by hammering out words on our iPhones. Our best guess: Trump meant to type \"coverage\".\n\nFor the record, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer responded this way when asked about covfefe: \"The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant.\"\n\nAnd thus ends the story. You may now go about your day.\n\nUpdate June 1: Or the story isn't over after all. A few readers suggested that Trump may have meant to type covfefe after all. \"Cov fe'fe\" in Arabic translates to \"I will stand up,\" at least according to Google Translate. Trump was recently in Saudi Arabia, where Arabic is the official language. Maybe he picked up a new phrase along the way, the thinking goes.\n\nIf so, the tweet would read \"Despite the constant negative press I will stand up.\"\n\nThe trouble is Arabic speakers we reached out to said that translation is wrong.\n\n\"This is incorrect; Arabic has no [v]. To be more specific, this is in accurate as far as Standard Arabic, Levantine Arabic (Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian) and Egyptian Arabic are concerned. My guess is that it is inaccurate in any Arabic dialect; however, although I manage with the other varieties, I do not claim to have native or native-like intuition about them,\" said Youssef A.
