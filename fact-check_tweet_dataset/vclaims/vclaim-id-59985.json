Before the allegations came to light, the financier had a rich and powerful circle of friends that included politicians and celebrities like Trump, former President Bill Clinton and actor Kevin Spacey.\n\nWhile Trump and Epstein have been photographed together, the image being shared does not show such an instance. The original picture, taken by photographer Yann Gamblin in the 90s, shows Trump kissing daughter Ivanka\u2019s head in the back of a limousine, according to the Getty Images caption. In the doctored photo, Epstein\u2019s head has been superimposed over hers, though some of her hair is still visible underneath.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Epstein has been photoshopped into a photo of Trump. In July 2019, the Daily Caller debunked a viral image that claimed to show Trump, his daughter and Epstein near a motorcycle.", "lang": "en"}
