But the president twisted several facts in service of his points.\n\u2022 Trump claimed that Cohen is \u201cmaking up a story,\u201d but there is corroborating evidence \u2014 including emails \u2014 that supports the version of events that Cohen is now telling prosecutors.\n\u2022 Trump said the Trump Tower Moscow project described by Cohen was \u201ca very public deal\u201d that \u201ceverybody knew about\u201d and \u201cwas written about in newspapers.\u201d But the public didn\u2019t learn until well into Trump\u2019s presidency that discussions about a tower project in Moscow took place during the campaign.\n\u2022 Trump said Cohen is lying in hopes of getting a reduced sentence for \u201cthings that have nothing to do with me.\u201d In fact, two of the charges Cohen pleaded guilty to in August were campaign finance violations related to hush money paid to Stormy Daniels at the direction of Trump.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty on Nov. 29 to lying to two congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Cohen admitted that in an attempt to shield Trump from investigation and scrutiny, he misled Congress about the extent and duration of negotiations with Russian officials about a possible Trump Tower development in Moscow. Contrary to what he told Congress \u2014 that those talks broke off in January 2016 \u2014 Cohen said they continued, with Trump\u2019s knowledge, until June of that year, after Trump had become the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nTrump was asked about these developments before he departed for the G20 summit in Argentina\n\nTrump claimed that Cohen is \u201cmaking up a story,\u201d but there is evidence to support what Cohen is now saying.\n\nThe \u201cpaper that Michael Cohen wrote\u201d refers to a two-page letter that Cohen submitted to the House and Senate intelligence committees on Aug. 28, 2017, and/or a Sept. 19, 2017, written statement to the Senate intelligence committee before he was scheduled to testify. The letter and written statement included some information about the Trump Organization\u2019s proposal to build a residential and commercial building in Moscow.\n\nBut, according to the special counsel\u2019s charging document, Cohen\u2019s statements about the Moscow project were \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d Cohen, by pleading guilty, admits the facts in the charging document are accurate.\n\nTrump\u2019s position is that Cohen told Congress the truth last year, but now he is \u201cmaking up a story.\u201d Let\u2019s go through what Cohen said last year and what evidence the special counsel\u2019s office presents that supports the version of events that Cohen now says is true. (We should note that the evidence disclosed in the plea agreement may not be all of the evidence that the government has in the case.)\n\nCohen told Congress that the Trump Organization dropped the project in January 2016 \u201cbefore the Iowa caucus and months before the very first primary.\u201d But the charging document says Cohen \u201cdiscussed efforts to obtain Russian governmental approval for the Moscow Project\u201d as late as June 2016, which is after Trump had enough delegates to become the party\u2019s nominee.\n\n\u201cCohen discussed the status and progress of the Moscow Project with Individual 1 on more than the three occasions Cohen claimed to the Committee, and he briefed family members of Individual 1 within the Company about the project,\u201d the court document says. \u201cIndividual 1\u201d is also identified as the \u201cowner of the company,\u201d meaning Trump.\n\nCohen told Congress he emailed a Russian official seeking help with the Moscow project, but he did not receive a response. But, in his plea agreement, Cohen admits that he did. The special counsel\u2019s office cites the existence of emails and at least one phone call between Cohen and \u201cthe personal assistant to Russian Official 1.\u201d\n\nIn a phone call with the Russian official\u2019s assistant on Jan. 20, 2016, \u201cCohen requested assistance in moving the project forward, both in securing land to build the proposed tower and financing the construction.\u201d\n\nCohen also told Congress he did not travel to Russia in connection with the Moscow project, according to the charging document. But Cohen did not tell Congress that he agreed to go to Russia to discuss the project and took steps to arrange for Trump to travel to Russia to discuss it as well. The special counsel\u2019s office cites messages that Cohen exchanged with \u201cIndividual 2,\u201d who was Cohen\u2019s contact with Russia.\n\n\u201cI had a chat with Moscow,\u201d Individual 2 wrote to Cohen on May 4, 2016. \u201cASSUMING the trip does happen the question is before or after the convention \u2026 Obviously the pre-meeting trip (you only) can happen anytime you want but the 2 big guys where [sic] the question. I said I would confirm and revert.\u201d In response, Cohen wrote, \u201cMy trip before Cleveland. [Individual 1] once he becomes the nominee after the convention.\u201d\n\nBut on June 14, 2016, Cohen had informed Individual 2 that he would not be traveling to Russia.\n\nTrump said the Trump Tower Moscow project described by Cohen was \u201ca very public deal\u201d that \u201ceverybody knew about\u201d and \u201cwas written about in newspapers.\u201d Not at the time.\n\nThe fact that the Trump Organization was negotiating for the development of a Trump Tower in Moscow even during his presidential campaign wasn\u2019t publicly known until Aug. 28, 2017, seven months into Trump\u2019s presidency. As the Washington Post reported at that time, Cohen reached out to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s personal spokesman in mid-January 2016 with an email seeking to revive stalled negotiations over the project.\n\nAccording to the Post, \u201cCohen told congressional investigators in a statement Monday that he did not recall receiving a response from [Putin\u2019s spokesman] or having further contact with Russian government officials about the project.\u201d\n\nThat was widely reported. But again, that was seven months into Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThat Trump was generally interested, prior to his campaign, in pursuing a major development in Moscow was certainly known for years. As the New York Times reported on Jan. 16, 2017, just prior to Trump\u2019s inauguration, Trump had flirted with a tower development in Moscow for more than two decades, without success. The Times wrote then that \u201cby the time Mr. Trump entered the presidential race, he had failed to get any real estate development off the ground in Russia. But it was not for lack of trying.\u201d\n\nBut as we said, the fact that business dealings between the Trump Organization and Russian officials continued well into Trump\u2019s presidential campaign wasn\u2019t public information until August 2017. At that time, it was widely reported that Cohen provided congressional investigators with a statement that said Trump signed a \u201cletter of intent\u201d during the 2016 campaign to pursue \u201ca proposal for \u2018Trump Tower Moscow.\u2019\u201d Cohen told Congress that Trump signed the letter of intent with a Moscow-based developer, I.C. Expert Investment Co., on Oct. 28, 2015, according to the Post.\n\nCohen also told Congress that in January 2016 he emailed Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for Russian President Putin, in an attempt to gain the approvals necessary for the project. \u201cThose permissions were never provided,\u201d Cohen wrote in his statement. \u201cI decided to abandon the proposal less than two weeks later for business reasons and do not recall any response to my email, nor any other contacts by me with Mr. Peskov or other Russian government officials about the proposal.\u201d\n\nTrump certainly wasn\u2019t talking about that during the campaign, a fact that got lost in his statements during the Nov. 29 press conference.\n\nTrump, Nov. 29: So Michael Cohen has made many statements to the House, as I understand it, and the Senate. He put out a statement talking about a project, which was essentially, I guess, more or less of an option that we were looking at in Moscow. Everybody knew about it. It was written about in newspapers. It was a well-known project. It was during the early part of \u201916 and, I guess, even before that. It lasted a short period of time. \u2026 So he\u2019s lying about a project that everybody knew about. I mean, we were very open with it. We were thinking about building a building. I guess we had \u2014 in a form, it was an option. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call it. We decided \u2014 I decided ultimately not to do it. There would have been nothing wrong if I did do it. If I did do it, there would have been nothing wrong. That was my business. \u2026 This deal was a very public deal. Everybody knows about this deal. I wasn\u2019t trying to hide anything.\n\nNow, Cohen says discussions with Russian officials about the tower development in Moscow actually continued until June 2016. According to criminal information filed along with Cohen\u2019s Nov. 29 plea deal, Cohen admitted to ongoing communication with Russian officials about the project, that he discussed these developments several times with Trump and that he agreed to travel to Russia to further the project.\n\nThe earlier, false statements were provided, Cohen acknowledged, to \u201cgive the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before \u2018the Iowa caucus and \u2026 the very first primary,\u2019 in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations,\u201d the information states.\n\nCohen\u2019s Crimes \u2018Have Nothing to Do With Me\u2019\n\nTrump said Cohen is lying in hopes of getting a reduced sentence for \u201cthings that have nothing to do with me.\u201d In fact, two of the charges Cohen pleaded guilty to in August were campaign finance violations related to $130,000 in hush money paid to Stormy Daniels \u201cat the direction of\u201d Trump.\n\nTrump ignored those charges during his press conference when he claimed Cohen\u2019s criminal culpability was unrelated to him or the Trump Organization.\n\nBack in August, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight separate criminal charges, including tax evasion and bank fraud. In all, Cohen faces up to 65 years in prison.\n\nIt\u2019s true that many of the charges are unrelated to the Trump Organization or Trump himself. And those charges unrelated to Trump carry the lion\u2019s share of the prison liability.\n\nBut Trump is leaving out that Cohen also pleaded guilty to two campaign finance law violations, and admitted in open court that he paid $130,000 in hush money to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, to silence her during the 2016 presidential election at the direction of Trump. In his guilty plea, Cohen also admitted he received $420,000 from the Trump Organization to reimburse him for the payment, plus expenses and a bonus.\n\nA campaign loan from an individual is considered a campaign contribution \u2014 subject to the limits of individual donations to candidate committees. Under federal law, individuals such as Cohen cannot make a contribution that exceeds $2,700 per election, and corporations, such as the Trump Organization, cannot make campaign contributions.\n\nThe two charges each carry a maximum five-year prison term. Cohen\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 12.", "lang": "en"}
