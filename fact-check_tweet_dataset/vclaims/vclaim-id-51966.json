The posts allege that the Queen made the remarks during her televised speech on April 6, 2020. However, the claim is false; Duterte was not mentioned in the Queen\u2019s address and the image has been doctored from another graphic that contains a genuine quote by the Queen.\n\nThe graphic was published here on Facebook on April 6, 2020. It has been shared more than 1,100 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe quote in the graphic reads: \u201cPres. Duterte is the kind of leader who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way. Filipinos are very fortunate to have him. Seriously, he looked so overworked. He may not be perfect, but he truly loves his country. Philippines doesn\u2019t have the worst government. It actually has the worst citizens. / Queen Elizabeth II / delivering a message of hope amid the coronavirus pandemic / April 6, 2020\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s Visayan-language caption translates to English as: \u201cOuch\u2026.\u201d\n\nQueen Elizabeth made a rare televised address on April 6, 2020, thanking healthcare workers and urging a \u201ccollective effort and common endeavour\u201d.
