The post refers to the Brexit referendum, saying this is a reminder to \u201cyoung, naive remain voters\u201d that these elderly people \u201chaven\u2019t \u201cstole\u201d your future, they gave you one\u201d and seems to imply that the people in these age groups played an active role in the Second World War or could recall the events.\n\nHowever, if that\u2019s the case, the claims made in the post are mostly untrue.\n\nFirstly, to illustrate claims about the experience of older people today during the Second World War and its aftermath, the claim actually shows an image of soldiers in the First World War. The last surviving veterans of the First World War died some years before the 2016 Brexit referendum though there are still some people alive today who were born before or during the conflict.\n\nNext, the claim that 65 year-olds \u201cknew\u201d rationing is highly unlikely. 65 year-olds in 2019 were born between 1953 and 1954. Food rationing ended in July 1954 meaning today\u2019s 65 year-olds were at most nine months old when rationing ended.\n\nSimilarly, today\u2019s 75 year-olds were born between 1943 and 1944. The last Luftwaffe (German air force) raid on Britain was in May 1944. Again, suggesting someone eight months old could remember this or played a role is highly unlikely.\n\nFinally, the claim that 90-year-olds knew panzers (German tanks) is more accurate. Today\u2019s 90 year-olds would have been around 10 or 11 years old when the Second World War started and so all would likely have known panzers in the sense of being aware of their existence.\n\nToday\u2019s 90 year-olds would have turned 18, the age for military service, between 1946 and 1947 and so were unlikely to have seen panzers in action unless they lied about their age.", "lang": "en"}
