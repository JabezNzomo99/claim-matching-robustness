The Islamic call to prayer has been regularly performed in Spain for decades.\n\nThe Islamic call to prayer, referred to as the adh\u0101n, is performed five times each day at mosques around the world. A muezzin, the member of a mosque specifically appointed for singing the call to prayer, traditionally performs it from atop a minaret, though not all mosques have such a structure.\n\nThe video shows a man in a minaret performing the Muslim call to prayer in the evening, with the caption claiming it is the \u201cfirst time in 500 years the adh\u0101n was publicly called by a human voice in Spain.\u201d (RELATED: FACT CHECK: Has Poland Refused To Allow The Building Of Mosques?)\n\nThe mosque in the video is actually located in Balakan, a city in northwestern Azerbaijan. The majority of the country\u2019s population is Muslim. Instagram user Kenan Musaev posted the video in November 2019 and noted in the comments that it \u201chas nothing to do with Spain,\u201d according to AFP Fact Check.\n\nEven if the video had been filmed in Spain, this wouldn\u2019t have been the first time in 500 years that the Muslim call to prayer was performed there. The Grand Mosque of Granada, located in the Spanish city of Granada, posted a video of a call to prayer in July 2017, for instance. Another call to prayer could previously be heard in Granada in 2003, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe Spanish constitution has legally protected freedom of religion and worship since its adoption in 1978.", "lang": "en"}
