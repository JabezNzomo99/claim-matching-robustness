National and regional news outlets published stories that described such an overall pattern, or specific examples of it, in June and July.\n\nThose references to a nationwide coin shortage were well-founded. In a June 11 news release, the U.S. Federal Reserve acknowledged the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic had significantly diminished the U.S. coin supply. That\u2019s primarily because members of the public had not been able to visit the places where they typically deposit coins, like retail stores, and exchange them for larger cash denominations (thus removing those coins from circulation) but also because the virus had put a strain on coin production at the U.S. Mint. The statement read:\n\n\u201cThe COVID\u201019 pandemic has significantly disrupted the supply chain and normal circulation patterns for U.S. coin. In the past few months, coin deposits from depository institutions to the Federal Reserve have declined significantly and the U.S. Mint\u2019s production of coin also decreased due to measures put in place to protect its employees. Federal Reserve coin orders from depository institutions have begun to increase as regions reopen, resulting in the Federal Reserve\u2019s coin inventory being reduced to below normal levels.\n\n\u201c\u2026 The Federal Reserve is working on several fronts to mitigate the effects of low coin inventories. This includes managing the allocation of existing Fed inventories, working with the Mint, as issuing authority, to minimize coin supply constraints and maximize coin production capacity, and encouraging depository institutions to order only the coin they need to meet near\u2010term customer demand.\u201d\n\nOn June 17, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell used the word \u201cshortages\u201d to describe the situation, saying that the \u201cflow of coins through the economy\u201d had \u201ckind of stopped.\u201d Asked whether he was aware of a coin shortage in Tennessee and elsewhere, Powell told the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services:\n\n\u201cYes, I am aware of it. I\u2019m very much aware of it, and let me say what\u2019s happened is that with the partial closure of the economy, the flow of coins through the economy has gotten all \u2014 it\u2019s kind of stopped. The places where you go to give your coins and get credit [inaudible] and get cash, you know, folding money \u2014 those have not been working, stores have been closed, so the whole system of flow has kind of come to a stop. We\u2019re well aware of this. We\u2019re working with the [U.S.] Mint, and we\u2019re working with the [Federal] Reserve banks, and as the economy reopens we\u2019re seeing coins begin to move around again.\u201d\n\nPressed by U.S. Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn., on whether the problem was temporary or pointed to larger structural issues, Powell insisted it was only temporary:\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s just temporary. It\u2019s due to the fact of the economy being, in significant part, closed, as I mentioned. And the flow of coins through the economy \u2026 Now we\u2019re beginning to see those shortages. We\u2019ve been aware of it, we\u2019re working with the Mint to increase supply and working with the Reserve banks to get that supply where it needs to be. So we think it\u2019s temporary, a temporary situation.\u201d\n\n\n\n On June 30, the Federal Reserve provided an update on its joint efforts, with the U.S. Mint, to combat the shortage of coins in circulation throughout the United States, announcing it had established a U.S. Coin Task Force to help coordinate those efforts:\n\n\u201cThe primary issue with coin is a dramatic deceleration of coin circulation through the supply chain. As of April 2020, the U.S. Treasury estimates that the total value of coin in circulation is $47.8 billion, up from $47.4 billion as of April 2019. While there is adequate coin in the economy, the slowed pace of circulation has meant that sufficient quantities of coin are not readily available where needed. With establishments like retail shops, bank branches, transit authorities and laundromats closed, the typical places where coin enters our society have slowed or even stopped the normal circulation of coin.\n\n\u201c\u2026 In early July, the Federal Reserve will convene a group of industry leaders for a limited-scope, limited duration task force, the U.S. Coin Task Force, to work together to identify, implement, and promote actions to reduce the consequence and duration of COVID-19 related disruptions to normal coin circulation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
