The Twitter account linked to Malik Obama, Barack Obama\u2019s half-brother, tweeted a picture of it on June 15.\n\nBut the alleged document is fake. It closely resembles another fake Kenyan birth certificate, debunked by Snopes in 2009, that was created using a copy of an Australian birth certificate issued in 1959. The fake birth certificate being shared this week has a gold seal in the bottom-left corner that reads \u201cSouth Australia\u201d and has similarities to faux documents that can be made on the website Republic of Kenya Birth Certificate Generator.\n\nThe fake birth certificate also wrongly states that Kenya was a republic in 1961, despite the country not becoming one until December 1964.

Hawaii Department of Health officials confirmed that those documents are authentic.\n\nThe Office of Barack and Michelle Obama did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Malik Obama.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
