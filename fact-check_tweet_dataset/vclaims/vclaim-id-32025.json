For instance, Newspunch, a website that has repeatedly trafficked in this sort of misinformation, published an article entitled \u201cMorgan Freeman is Jimi Hendrix, Researchers Claim\u201d in May 2018, stating:\n\nJimi Hendrix reinvented himself as actor Morgan Freeman in the 1970\u2019s, shortly after faking his own death, researchers claim. According to internet sleuths, Morgan Freeman\u2019s sudden rise to fame in the 1970\u2019s occurred after Hendrix supposedly died on September 18, 1970.\n\nNewspunch later updated the intro and title of this article to make it clear that this rumor originated with conspiracy theorists and not \u201cresearchers\u201d:\n\nThe idea that Freeman is actually Hendrix is largely based on three claims: Freeman and Hendrix are both fans of music; Freeman and Hendrix look alike; and Freeman\u2019s acting career didn\u2019t take off until after Hendrix\u2019 death in 1970.\n\nWhile the first two claims may be accurate, they are also not especially convincing. After all, Freeman and Hendrix are far from the only people who enjoy music. Freeman does own a blues bar in Mississippi, but if liking blues music is the threshold for evidence, it\u2019s equally likely that Freeman is actually Robert Johnson, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Freddie King, Little Walter, Big Bill Broonzy, Mississippi John Hurt, T-Bone Walker, or any other famous, deceased blues musician.\n\nFreeman\u2019s appreciation for blues music probably speaks more to his upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, and Chicago, Illinois, than it does to the claim that Freeman is actually a deceased musician.\n\nFreeman and Hendrix also do bare a passing resemblance to one another:\n\nHowever, many of the image comparisons accompanying this rumor border on parody. The website WellAware1, for instance, attempted to draw a definitive link between Freeman and Hendrix based on the wrinkles seen in two photographs taken decades apart:\n\nScribbling lines onto a photograph does not constitute evidence.\n\nThe final claim, holding that Freeman\u2019s career didn\u2019t begin until after Hendrix\u2019s death, is inaccurate.\n\nHendrix died on Sept. 18, 1970. A post-mortem examination found that Hendrix died of \u201csuffocation due to barbiturate intoxication.\u201d A newspaper clipping on Hendrix\u2019 death can be found below:\n\nWhile Freeman was not a household name at the time of Hendrix\u2019s death, his acting career began prior to 1970. Morgan\u2019s first onscreen appearance came in 1964 in a non-credited role in the Sidney Lumet movie \u201cThe Pawnbroker.\u201d Freeman also appeared in at least four stage productions, including \u201cHello, Dolly!,\u201d \u201cThe Dozen,\u201d and \u201cExhibition,\u201d prior to Hendrix\u2019s death. Here\u2019s a newspaper clipping from 1969 featuring an unflattering review of \u201cThe Dozens\u201d published in The Herald-News:\n\nIt seems a bit implausible that Hendrix was moonlighting as an actor at the same time he was performing as a musician just so that he could fake his death and pursue a career in the movies.", "lang": "en"}
