Internal organs were removed from their bodies, like kidney and liver. Tamil Nadu police has said these children were abducted from various countries and brought here. Note: Take care of your children. Send this message to every group. Spread this photograph so much that this dog is caught. Who does not circulate this is not his/mother\u2019s child. Send this to as many groups- 1, 2, 3, 4, or 25. This rascal must be caught.\u201d\n\nThe message and photo have also found their way to Facebook. Alt News has decided not to post the audio clip, for fear of misuse.\n\nThe photograph showing dead bodies in white shrouds, shared along with the message is from June 2015. It was clicked in Pakistan.\n\nAccording to Getty Images, where this image is available,\u201cPakistani Edhi charity volunteers bury the bodies of unclaimed heatwave victims at a graveyard in Karachi on June 26, 2015. Pakistani welfare volunteers on June 26 held a mass funeral for 50 victims of Karachi\u2019s worst heatwave in decades, whose bodies had gone unclaimed.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the IAF airstrike in February 2019, this photo had been shared as \u2018proof\u2019 of casualties caused by the attack. Alt News\u2019 fact-check can be read here.\n\nMessage was viral in 2017 as well\n\nAlt News found that the exact message had been shared earlier as well, in 2017. The photograph accompanying it, however, was not the one being shared now.\n\nAccording to the fact-checking website Snopes, the above photograph is actually of the aftermath of the Ghouta chemical attack of 2013, in Syria.\n\nChild abduction rumours were rampant in April-May 2018, which resulted in a spate of mob lynching incidents in various states. Alt News had found that these rumours followed a highly customised pattern; the language and places referred to in the viral messages would be altered depending on where the message is being circulated. These rumours were viral across the country, from Uttar Pradesh to Gujarat to Tamil Nadu to Odisha. These messages had taken a communal turn, when Rohingya Muslims were targeted in July 2018 as child abductors.\n\nUsers of messaging and social media platforms are advised to be extremely circumspect with regard to such messages, and not forward them.", "lang": "en"}
