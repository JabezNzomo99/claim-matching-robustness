The claim is false. Although some of the ingredients listed do feature in children\u2019s vaccines, the doses involved are not toxic, pass through the body and ensure the reliability of the vaccination, according to health experts.\n\nThe post, shared more than 20,000 times in English on Facebook in May 2020, lists 26 substances, claiming: \u201cIn the first six years of life your child receives the following\u201d. The list is posted alongside a picture of a baby doll with 20 medical syringes injected into it. The claim also circulated in French and Dutch.\n\nContrary to what is claimed in the post, the listed substances are not toxic, lethal or carcinogenic when used in small doses. Health Canada points out that vaccines may contain \u201cminute amounts of chemicals that are used during the production process, such as for the growth or purification of specific antigens or the inactivation of toxins.\u201d\n\nHere are some specific examples where specialists examined the individual ingredients and found the doses are too small to be toxic.\n\nThe post questions the use of \u201c801.6 mcg (micrograms) formaldehyde (carcinogen, embalming agent)\u201d in vaccines.\n\nAccording to Health Canada, formaldehyde is \u201cused to inactivate viruses and protein toxins\u201d in the production stage of the vaccine.\n\nAlthough the dosage in the post is roughly correct, the implication of its risks is misleading.\n\n\u201cChildren are exposed to many of these ingredients at a far higher dose through other natural sources,\u201d Dr Natasha Crawcroft, Director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto told AFP via email. \u201cFor example, pears include 50 times more formaldehyde than any vaccine.\u201d\n\nThis is confirmed by the University of Oxford\u2019s Vaccine Knowledge Project: \u201cThe amount of natural formaldehyde in a two-month-old infant\u2019s blood (around 1.1 milligrams in total) is 10 times greater than the amount found in any vaccine (less than 0.1 milligrams).\u201d\n\nIt is also incorrect to describe the dosage of formaldehyde in vaccines as an \u201cembalming agent.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo embalm a body you need something like 6-10 liter of formaldehyde \u2013 it\u2019s nothing at all like the tiny amounts in vaccines,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nThe post also claims that a vaccinated child receives \u201c116 mcg potassium chloride (used in a lethal injection)\u201d. Potassium chloride is a potassium salt.\n\n\u201cOne aspect that is not made clear is the importance of dose. Everything including water can be lethal if given in too large a dose, but can at the same time be essential for life at the right dose. This is true of potassium and sodium chloride, for example,\u201d Crawcroft said.\n\nProfessor Francois Chast, Honorary President of France\u2019s National Academy of Pharmacy told AFP: \u201cA dangerous dose would be over 1 to 2 grams; 116 mcg is a dose 10,000 times smaller than that.\u201d\n\nChast also explained that lethal injections are administered intravenously. \u201cVaccines are not injected into a vein.\u201d\n\nThe use of \u201cpotassium phosphate\u201d and \u201csodium bicarbonate\u201d are also questioned by the post. Additives such as potassium or sodium salts are used in vaccines and medication to \u201chelp control product acidity (pH) and maintain the quality of vaccine antigens,\u201d according to Health Canada.\n\nThe post also condemns the use of \u201cantibiotics\u201d in vaccines.\n\nThese antibiotics are used at the production stage of the vaccine \u201cto prevent contamination during viral cell culture,\u201d according to Health Canada.\n\nThese products are excipients, or inactive ingredients used to help preserve medications and vaccines and to facilitate their administration.\n\nThese excipients are very quickly eliminated by the body and do not accumulate in a child\u2019s body over time.\n\nThe University of Oxford\u2019s Vaccine Knowledge Project adds that \u201cantibiotics which commonly cause allergic reactions (such as penicillins, cephalosporins and sulphonamides) are not used in vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe post criticises the use of \u201c5,700 mcg aluminum\u201d which it describes as \u201cneurotoxin.\u201d\n\nThis substance is used as an adjuvant. According to Health Canada, these allow a \u201creduction in the amount of antigen per dose or the total number of doses needed to achieve immunity,\u201d meaning that without them, patients might require much larger or more doses for the vaccines to be effective.\n\nThe University of Oxford adds: \u201cthe amount of aluminium present in vaccines is small -- less than 2 milligrams of the salts, and less than a milligram of actual aluminium.\u201d\n\nThis Health Canada study concluded that a toddler between the ages of six months and fouryears ingests over 1.5 milligrams of aluminum through normal consumption of drinking water, food, beverages, air and soil in the space of three days.\n\nThe post lists \u201c23,250 mcg gelatin (ground up animal carcass)\u201d and \u201cOver 560 mcg polysorbate 80 (carcinogen)\u201d as being present in the vaccines.\n\nThe Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States states that gelatin is used \u201cto keep the vaccine effective\u201d after it is manufactured.\n\nGelatin is commonly consumed by \u201ceating food such as Jell-O\u201d and it \u201cresides in the body naturally\u201d.\n\nPolysorbate 80 is \u201ca common food additive used in several vaccines as an emulsifier (to hold other ingredients together),\u201d according to the University of Oxford. \u201cCompared to its use in foods, there is very little polysorbate 80 in vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe list is posted with a picture of a doll being injected with 20 medical syringes. These are alleged to represent \u201chow many vaccines a child receives by age two\u201d.\n\nThis is misleading. Canada does not have national mandatory vaccination, with Ontario and New Brunswick being the only provinces requiring them for a child to attend school.\n\nFollowing the recommended vaccination schedule, a two year old child in Canada would have received eight vaccines, spread across 17 or 18 doses.\n\nIn the United States they would receive 10, spread across 33 or 34 doses, up to the age of two.\n\nThe total number of doses will vary as some vaccines can be administered through a single injection or multiple shots.\n\nVaccine ingredients are a regular source of misinformation.
