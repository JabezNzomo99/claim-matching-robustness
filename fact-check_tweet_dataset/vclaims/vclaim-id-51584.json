No, that's not true: A video of Harris being sworn into office as a U.S. senator on January 3, 2017, clearly shows a Bible was used. There is no evidence that any of her previous oaths -- including for California attorney general -- were not done using a Bible.\n\nThe claim was made in a post (archived here) shared on Facebook on August 12, 2020. It read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nStill photographers are not allowed on the senate floor, but Biden and Harris re-enacted the ceremony off the floor -- using a Bible, as shown in this image released by the Harris press office:\n\nFortunately, C-SPAN recorded the actual ceremony and has the proof in video form. Watch as Vice President Biden swears in Harris as a U.S. senator on January 3, 2017. You see a Bible and you hear Biden ask Harris to put her right hand on the Bible:\n\nOther recent false claims about Kamala Harris that Lead Stories has debunk include:\n\nFact Check: Kamala Harris' Birth Certificate Does NOT Identify Her As 'Caucasian'\n\nFact Check: Senator Kamala Harris IS A United States Citizen And IS Eligible To Be President\n\nFact Check: Kamala Harris Did NOT Say She Listened To Snoop And Tupac In College\n\nFact Check: Kamala Harris Did NOT Call Joe Biden 'A Racist And A Rapist'\n\nFact Check: Photo Is NOT Kamala Harris With Her Parents And Is NOT Evidence She Is Not A Black American\n\nFact Check: Kamala Harris Said She Believed Women Who Said They Felt 'Uncomfortable' By Biden Touching -- NOT 'Rape Accusers'\n\nFact Check: Kamala Harris Descended From A Slave Owner, But It's Not 'An Inconvenient Part Of Her History' Or A 'Deep, Dark Secret' That 'Could Come Back To Haunt Her'", "lang": "en"}
