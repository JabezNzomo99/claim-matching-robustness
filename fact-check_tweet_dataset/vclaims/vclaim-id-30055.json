But they\u2019re photoshopped.\n\n\"Have they forgotten these pictures,\" reads the text over a Jan. 24 Facebook post that splices together three separate photos of Obama, Clinton and Rice, each one manipulated to make it appear as though they were posing with bin Laden.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe\u2019ve previously debunked the image showing bin Laden shaking hands with Clinton, the former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic nominee for president. Other fact-checkers have, too.\n\nThat image appeared in a 2007 Photoshop contest on FreakingNews.com and gained traction after a Russian official was duped into talking about it on state TV. The original photo shows Clinton shaking Indian musician Shubhashish Mukherjee\u2019s hand in 2004.\n\nOther fact-checkers have also addressed the image of bin Laden with Rice, the former secretary of state and national security adviser to President George W. Bush. That image appeared in an \"April Fool's Day\" Photoshop contest on FreakingNews.com in 2007.\n\nFinally, other fact-checkers have also debunked the third image, which shows Obama wearing a Hawaiian lei and smiling beside a thumbs-up-giving bin Laden. The real photo shows Obama and Hawaii attorney Andre Wooten.\n\nThe photo appears on Wooten\u2019s website and Facebook page and also on the cover of attorney Daphne Barbee-Wooten\u2019s 2010 book, \"African-American Attorneys in Hawaii.\"\n\nAccording to Andre Wooten\u2019s Facebook page, the photo was taken in December 2005 when Obama, then a U.S. senator representing Illinois, visited Honolulu. Barbee-Wooten told the Daily Caller\u2019s Check Your Fact that she snapped the original photo.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
