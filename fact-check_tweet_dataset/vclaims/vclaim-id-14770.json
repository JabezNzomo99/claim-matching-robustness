The claim is false; the video is a Bloomberg news programme from February 2018 that reported the possibility of Subianto entering the 2019 election. It did not say that Subianto was \u201csuperior to\u201d Widodo or leading him in opinion polls.\n\nThis video, which has been viewed more than 89,000 times on Instagram since it was posted on April 11, has a caption that says: \"Good evening friends. We have news from abroad. Enjoy. I found it hard to translate what they say in the clip because they speak very quickly. But it primarily says that Prabowo is superior to Jae... That's what the clip basically about.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Instagram post:\n\n\u201cJae\u201d references Widodo. On social media, Subianto supporters frequently refer to the incumbent using the terms \u201cJae\u201d or \u201cJaenudin Nachiro\u201d. Here is a December 6, 2018, Detik.com story on the issue.\n\nThe text running across of the bottom of the video says in English: \"SUBIANTO MAY ENTER INDONESIAN RACE.\"\n\nEntering that text into a Google search, AFP traced the clip back to this February 27, 2018, footage posted on the Bloomberg website.\n\nThe exact same footage that is used in the misleading Instagram post appears in the original Bloomberg report from 0:07 to 1:04.\n\nBelow is a side-by-side comparison of screenshots of the video in the misleading Instagram post and the actual Bloomberg clip:\n\nNeither the original Bloomberg report not the clip in the misleading Instagram post say that Subianto \"is superior to\" Widodo.\n\nThe newscaster says: \u201cFormer general Prabowo Subianto may enter the race in Indonesia, which would be a rerun of the bitter 2014 race won by Joko Widodo.\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian word \"unggul\" used in the Instagram caption can also be translated to \"leading ahead of\".\n\nThe news program does not mention any survey putting the challenger ahead of the incumbent.\n\nSubianto and Widodo are running in the presidential election on April 17, 2019. Here is the election commission\u2019s website that lists the candidates.", "lang": "en"}
