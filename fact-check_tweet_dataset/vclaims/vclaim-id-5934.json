What if this gal has a boyish-sounding name and adopts children rather than bears her own? A rumor, apparently. And one she would rather not discuss at all:\n\nAccording to an oft-repeated whisper, Jamie Lee Curtis acknowledged that she was born an intersexual (the preferred medical term for persons of ambiguous gender, replacing \u2018hermaphrodite\u2019).\n\nSo? Is she, or isn\u2019t she?\n\nNo one but , her parents, and her doctors has the definitive answer to this question, and none of them is talking. Contrary to common assertion, never made such a revelation during an interview or public appearance and has repeatedly declined deigning to provide a response to this rumor, and her if they had something to say and wanted to say bound by laws regarding doctor-patient confidentiality.\n\nThis rumor is often lent credibility by people who have heard it repeated as fact by their university professors (especially those with specialties relating to intersexuality). Neither the hearer nor the teller ever seems to be able to provide a credible explanation of he knows this piece of information to be true, the chain of transmission always tracing back to the notoriously unreliable \u201cSomeone else told me about it.\u201d As happens over and over, even the most trusted of sources can sometimes take a widespread rumor at face value, then parrot it as fact.\n\nOkay, so we simply don\u2019t know. Why, then, is this rumor so widespread?\n\nJamie Lee is the daughter of Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh. At the time of Jamie Lee\u2019s arrival into this world, her father was a roguishly good-looking leading man, an actor female moviegoers couldn\u2019t help but swoon over. Her mother was a beauty and a renowned actress. Their union produced two daughters, Kelly Lee in 1956 and Jamie Lee in 1958.\n\nIn their day, Curtis and Leigh were one of Hollywood\u2019s up-and-coming couples, two successful, ambitious, famous people who appeared to have it all, with that \u2018all\u2019 including a happy marriage and two fine children. (As is often the case, appearances were deceiving: Curtis and Leigh divorced in 1962 after eleven years of marriage, and there were more difficult times ahead for both of them.) It\u2019s thus possible that the current rumor about Jamie Lee stems from an ancient backlash against her parents, long-ago envy expressed as a slander about what the union of two \u201cperfect\u201d people had produced. Just as the fox decries as sour the grapes that hang out of his reach, so might meanspirited folks fed up with hearing about the beautiful people spread a rumor that cuts these stars down to size.\n\nTwo facts lend an aura of credence to the rumor that Jamie Lee was born with both male and female bodyparts. The first is her two-way name: According to the rumor, a boyish appellation was bestowed upon her by parents who hadn\u2019t yet decided whether to have a boy or a girl \u201cmade\u201d of their baby and wanted to be prepared to go either way, but that wasn\u2019t the case of it. Janet Leigh explained how she came to choose the name:\n\nIf the names were truly chosen before the children arrived, that puts paid to the notion that \u2018Jamie Lee\u2019 was so christened in response to a medical condition that would only have been discovered after her delivery. (Jamie Lee Curtis was born long before the development of medical technology that could identify dual-gendered fetuses.)\n\nThe second fact that supports the rumor is own children: They\u2019re adopted. Though couples opt for adoptive children over natural progeny for any number of reasons, it is true the operation necessary to correct dual gendering in a female infant would leave her unable to bear children.\n\nDegrees of intersexuality vary in intensity from presence of an additional to being born with a mixed set of genitals. Treatment of cases of blatant intersexuality is generally (but not always) surgical in nature, with reconstruction performed on the infant patient to add or remove body parts so as to end up with a child completely male or female in physical appearance. Hormones are also given towards this end, but there is a limit to what can be corrected medically. Though an appearance of sexual normalcy can be constructed, fully functional reproductive organs cannot.\n\nAccording to Fausto-Sterling, a recognized expert in this field of study, to of all births do not fall strictly within the tight definition of all-male or all-female, even if the child looks \u201cnormal.\u201d In reaching her numbers, Sterling is counting all incidents of intersexuality, from mild to extreme. The incidence of children with mixed genitalia is pegged at 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 3,000, or 0.033 to of all births.\n\nIntersexuality is a reality; some children are ambiguously gendered at birth. However, one particular point needs to be made, and made quite vehemently: The existence of such medical conditions is not reason in itself to suppose that Jamie Lee Curtis has any of them. Using the one to bolster belief in the second is akin to claiming the existence of the Atlantic Ocean somehow proves a particular ship sank in it.\n\nIt is a telling commentary on the skewed importance we give any matter relating to sexuality that this rumor exists at all. Numerous children come into the world less than perfectly formed, yet no stigma is attached to those who require surgery to repair a malfunctioning heart, a disorder of the digestive system, or almost any other condition unrelated to gender. Yet when the question of sexuality is raised, it\u2019s all whispers behind hands and meaningful looks.", "lang": "en"}
