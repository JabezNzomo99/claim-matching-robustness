There must be grounds for investigation. For now, we are seeing a comatose patient.\"\n\nThere was no \u201churry\u201d in the German doctors \u201cuse of the word poisoning.\u201d The Charite hospital in Berlin, to which Navalny was transported last Saturday, Aug. 22, from the Siberian city of Omsk, announced the first results of its examination of him on Monday, Aug. 24 \u2013 two days after he was admitted.\n\nCharite hospital said in a statement that \u201cNavalny underwent extensive examination\u201d and that \u201cclinical findings indicate poisoning with a substance of cholinesterase inhibitors.\u201d\n\nWhile the \u201cspecific substance involved remains unknown,\u201d the German doctors indicated they had no doubts that Navalny was poisoned. \u201cThe effect of the poison\u2026 was confirmed by multiple tests in independent laboratories,\u201d the hospital said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell and U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan are among the many foreign officials who have asked the Kremlin to launch an independent investigation into Navalny\u2019s poisoning.\n\nPeskov said the Kremlin deemed such an investigation groundless because the exact \u201csubstance has not been found\u201d and that the \u201cpatient is comatose.\u201d He also said that the doctors in Germany had not said anything about Navalny that was different from what those who initially treated him in Omsk had said.\n\nHowever, unlike the doctors in Berlin, the doctors in Omsk have publicly denied that any of their testing found that Navalny was poisoned.\n\nIn media reports, the suspicion that Navalny was poisoned was originally attributed to Navalny\u2019s press secretary, Kira Yarmysh.\n\nYarmysh was the first to tweet about Navalny being poisoned, but later said she was only repeating what emergency room doctors in the Omsk hospital told her.\n\nOn Monday, Aug. 24, the Omsk hospital\u2019s deputy head doctor, Anatoly Kalinichenko, confirmed Yarmysh\u2019s information. \u201cThe emergency room doctors diagnosed him with toxic poisoning and that is why the patient was admitted to the toxicology unit,\u201d he said.\n\nKalinichenko added: \u201cBut the labs in Moscow and Omsk did not find any traces of toxic substances, so we\u2019ve moved away from the poisoning diagnosis.\u201d\n\nAlexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor of the Omsk hospital, complained during the same press conference that Navalny\u2019s wife Yulya \u201cnever thanked\u201d him or any other doctors for \u201csaving her husband\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nNavalny, the opposition leader and a long-time opponent of President Putin, was delivered to Murakhovsky\u2019s care on Aug. 20 \u2013 after he fell ill on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk.\n\nNavalny\u2019s relatives and supporters have criticized Murakhovsky. Oleg Navalny, the opposition leader\u2019s younger brother, accused the doctor of endangering his brother\u2019s life by resisting his evacuation to Germany, concealing test results and claiming that he had not been poisoned.\n\nOleg Navalny accused Murakhovsky of acting on the orders of Russia\u2019s security services.\n\nMurakhovsky told journalists on Aug. 21 that Navalny\u2019s condition was due to a \u201cmetabolic disorder\u201d and a \u201csudden drop\u201d in blood sugar levels. The Omsk hospital chief doctor repeatedly denied that the opposition leader had been poisoned.\n\nMurakhovsky was echoed by several Russian state media reports claiming that the \u201cmetabolic disorder\u201d was the result of Navalny\u2019s \u201calcohol abuse.\u201d A whole narrative about a \u201cdrunken night\u201d on the outskirts of Tomsk was created.\n\nThat story \u2013 just one of the many disinformation narratives that emerged in Russia as Navalny remains in a coma \u2013 has been debunked, including by the Tomsk resident in whose house, according to Russian media, Navalny \u201cpoisoned himself with samogon\u201d (Russian moonshine).\n\nMoreover, according to a report in the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets (MK.ru), during his trip to Tomsk, Navalny was under round-the-clock surveillance ordered from Moscow, \u201cbecause even the feds did not know what his plans were.\u201d\n\nMK.ru reported that two teams of plain clothes agents from two cities followed Navalny and his team, recording and documenting their every move. Citing a law enforcement source, the newspaper said that Navalny and his team did not purchase any alcohol.\n\nMK.ru also reported that they drove to one of his follower\u2019s home village of Kaftanchikovo, some 12 miles outside of Tomsk, for Navalny to take a swim in the local river \u2013 his long time tradition when visiting new places.\n\nMurakhovsky claimed that the initial decision not to allow Navalny to be evacuated to Germany was because the doctors at Omsk hospital reached a consensus that he was \u201cnon-transportable.\u201d He also claimed \u201cnone of our German colleagues objected\u201d to that decision.\n\nBut that was not what the German doctors said: they insisted, that Navalny was \u201cfit to be airlifted and transported to Berlin.\u201d\n\nThe Omsk hospital\u2019s refusal to release Navalny for transfer to Germany, as demanded by his family, delayed his evacuation for nearly 24 hours.\n\nMany social media users wrote that they believed Putin directly ordered that the Omsk doctors do not allow Navalny to be flown to Germany. These suspicions were reflected by Russians who hit the streets in Moscow and other cities, holding pieces of paper with \u201cPutin, let Navalny go!\u201d handwritten or printed on them. Arrests followed.\n\nMurakhovsky denied any political influence or pressure, as did Dmitry Peskov.\n\nPeskov promised the Kremlin would do everything it could to expedite Navalny\u2019s transfer, if asked for help, and a day later claimed no one had made such a request. But Navalny\u2019s wife Yulia published a copy of her request for such a transfer that she had addressed to Vladimir Putin and mailed to the Kremlin. She tweeted that she was \u201csurprised to learn from the press, that it has not been received.\u201d\n\nNavalny remains in a coma and his prognosis is unclear. The Charite hospital in Berlin said there is the \u201cpossibility of long-term effects, particularly those affecting the nervous system.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a toxic disinformation campaign targeting Navalny is only accelerating in Russia, with top lawmakers, government agencies and celebrities joining the chorus.\n\nOn Tuesday, Aug. 25, Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma (the lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament) ordered an investigation to determine whether the Navalny case is an attempt to destabilize Russia from abroad.", "lang": "en"}
