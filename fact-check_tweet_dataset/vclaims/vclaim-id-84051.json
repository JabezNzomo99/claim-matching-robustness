In this video, the women narrate how they were pulled out from their houses and beaten up. They also showed their injury marks. One woman cannot stop crying because of the atrocity she faced.\n\nPost UP elections, many people who are opposed to BJP and its core ideology of Hindutva have wondered as to how does BJP continue to win, especially post demonetisation. Well, if such is the opposition, who is the voter to vote for? Who will ever vote for such goonda politics?", "lang": "en"}
