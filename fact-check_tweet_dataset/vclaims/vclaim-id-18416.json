Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The woman in the photo said that she got converted herself from Hinduism into Islam because a person can drink cow urine but cannot drink water from the hands of a Dalit in Hinduism. Fact: The woman in the photo never mentioned about double standards in Hinduism. She mentioned that her husband forcibly converted her into Islam. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the photo was found in a website called \u2018Hindu Existence\u2019. On that website, it was written that the name of the woman in the photo is Jaya Bhandari and she lives in Ranchi. When searched on Google with the information found, a news article published by Hindustan Times in 2015 was found in the search results. According to the article in the Hindustan Times, Jaya Bhandari (a divorcee) was forcibly converted into Islam by her second husband. It can also be read that she filed a police complaint as her husband and in-laws forced her to eat beef, assaulted her and also, changed her name to Zoya Anwar.\n\nTo sum it up, the woman in the photo said that she was forced to convert into Islam by her husband and she did not speak anything about double standards of Hinduism.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
