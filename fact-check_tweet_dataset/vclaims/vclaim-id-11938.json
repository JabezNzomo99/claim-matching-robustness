Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!\"\n\nThere are some major factual problems with Trump\u2019s claim, we found.\n\nFirst, a new report from the Justice Department\u2019s internal watchdog suggests the roughly 19,000 messages slipped through the cracks due to technical glitches with the FBI\u2019s data-collection tool on Samsung devices, not because Strzok and Page went around the system.\n\nSecond, perhaps most importantly, while the messages were initially not captured, they have since been recovered. Trump\u2019s claim gives the false impression the texts are still unaccounted. In fact, at least a portion of the recovered texts were given to Congress and described in press reports. Some messages between Strzok and Page were published by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General in a June 2018 report.\n\nThe inspector general was unable to recover text messages Strzok and Page may have sent using iPhones they were given when they joined Mueller\u2019s team. But a special counsel official who reviewed Strzok\u2019s iPhone before it was reset found it contained no substantive messages.\n\nThere is no evidence the text messages show the special counsel investigation is a \"hoax.\"\n\nWe reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear back\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, the Justice Department\u2019s internal watchdog looked into whether the FBI followed protocol when it investigated Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. It published its findings in a June 2018 report.\n\nAs part of its inquiry, the Office of Inspector General collected texts exchanged between Strzok and Page, some of which showed hostility toward Trump and a preference for Clinton. (Strzok was later fired from from the FBI and Page has since left.)\n\nThe inspector general discovered a five-month gap in the Strzok-Page communications, from mid-December 2016 through mid-May 2017. This prompted the inspector general to conduct a follow-on report to supplement its June 2018 findings. The follow-on report, which further described the inspector general\u2019s forensic efforts to recover the missing Strzok-Page texts, was released Dec. 13.\n\nThe inspector general found no evidence Strzok and Page tried to prevent the FBI from collecting their texts.\n\nThe watchdog\u2019s findings suggest the most likely reason the texts weren\u2019t captured had to do with technical flaws in the FBI\u2019s data-collection process, not deliberate wrongdoing.\n\nIt concluded: \"The OIG investigation determined that the FBl's collection tool was not only failing to collect any data on certain phones during particular periods of time, it also does not appear that it was collecting all text messages even when it was generally functioning to collect text messages.\"\n\nFBI tech specialists cited a number of possible explanations for the text-collection breakdown, from a 2016 software bug, to misconfiguration during the phone\u2019s setup to a range of possible hardware errors, according to the inspector general report.\n\nThe collection tool had an estimated failure rate of 20 percent when used with FBI-issued Samsung S5 mobile devices. Both Strzok and Page used the S5 model during the five-month gap, the report found.\n\nOnly later in mid-2017 were they issued S7 models \"as part of a regular technical refresh and to address issues with the FBl\u2019s text message collection tool,\" according to the inspector general.\n\nAn outside expert hired by the inspector general to assist with the Samsung portion of the investigation concluded \"it was unlikely that Strzok and Page attempted to circumvent the FBI's text message collection capabilities,\" and the watchdog found no evidence they did.\n\nThe inspector general also found the \"content of the text messages did not appear to be a factor\" in the retention practices of Strzok and Page.\n\nSeparately from their Samsung devices, the two officials were issued Apple iPhones when they began working as members of the special counsel investigation.\n\nBy the time the inspector general obtained their Apple phones, they had been reset to factory settings so they could be reassigned, and contained no data related to the previous owner\u2019s use, the report states.\n\nThe special counsel records officer told the inspector general that she reviewed Strzok's DOJ-issued iPhone after he returned it to the special counsel \"and determined it contained no substantive text messages.\" (Upon her departure from the FBI, Page left her iPhone in her office, rather than return it to the special counsel records officer.)\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet seems to suggest the Strzok-Page texts are gone forever \u2014 hence why Trump laments that they \"would have\" exonerated him.\n\nBut this overlooks the fact that the inspector general managed to recover thousands of messages that were initially not collected because of the technical snafu described above.\n\n\"OIG digital forensic examiners used forensic tools to recover thousands of text messages\" from the Samsung S5 devices of Strzok and Page, the report notes.\n\nForensic experts recovered more than 9,300 texts sent or received from Strzok's S5 phone, about 8,300 of which were sent to or received from Page. They also collected 10,760 texts from Page\u2019s S5 device, about 9,700 of which were communications with Strzok.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say with precision how many unique texts were recovered. That\u2019s because some are duplicates, and because the inspector general nabbed some message fragments that did not have an associated date or time, and these were not included in the inspector general\u2019s calculation. They also recovered texts from a separate database which added marginally to the overall number of texts the inspector general recovered.\n\nTrump\u2019s reference to 19,000 texts appears to be the result of adding the total texts recovered from Strzok\u2019s and Page\u2019s S5 phones together.\n\nBut his suggestion that the messages are permanently lost is wrong. The OIG recovered a total of more than 126,000 lines of text from Strzok and Page.\n\nAt least a portion of the recovered texts were given to Congress and described in press reports. Some messages between Strzok and Page were published in the inspector general\u2019s June 2018 report on the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation.\n\nTrump said 19,000 text messages exchanged between former FBI officials that were \"purposely and illegally deleted ... would have explained (the special counsel investigation) hoax.\"\n\nThe Justice Department inspector general\u2019s report suggests the texts slipped through the cracks due to technical glitches with the FBI\u2019s data-collection tool, not because Strzok and Page deliberately deleted them.\n\nAn outside expert hired by the inspector general concluded \"it was unlikely that Strzok and Page attempted to circumvent the FBI's text message collection capabilities,\" and the watchdog found no evidence they did.\n\nTrump\u2019s suggestion that the messages are permanently lost is wrong. The OIG recovered more than 19,000 messages from the government-issued Samsung phones of Strzok and Page, totaling more than 126,000 lines of text.\n\nAnd lastly, there is no evidence the texts show that the special counsel investigation is, as Trump called it, a \"hoax.\"\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
