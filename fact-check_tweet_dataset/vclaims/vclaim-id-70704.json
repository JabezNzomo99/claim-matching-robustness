I really don't,\" he said during his second seven-minute interview that week, according to CBSSports.com. \"I appreciate it, but I don't get it. I'm just here so I won't get fined, boss. That's the only reason I'm here.\"\n\nThe reluctance to talk from a player nicknamed Beast Mode gave sports pundits something new to discuss ahead of Sunday's big game. Was the media overreacting, or was Lynch kind of being a jerk?\n\n, a host and analyst on Fox Sports\u2019 Fox Football Daily, asked a panel of former NFL players Randy Moss, Brian Urlacher and Michael Strahan about Lynch\u2019s wave-making in a Jan. 29 segment. The ex-players agreed that Lynch looked uncomfortable dealing with the media.\n\nKlatt said his reluctance won\u2019t matter much to Seahawks fans by Sunday.\n\n\"Really, all they care about is that his production continues in the direction that it's going,\" Klatt said. \"When you talk about postseason, second all-time in terms of average yards per rush only to Terrell Davis. So this guy can definitely play.\"\n\nWe wanted to know if Klatt was right about Lynch\u2019s postseason rushing prowess. (A spokesman for Fox Sports did not get back to us.)\n\nWe turned to the , which serves up sports statistics for professional sports leagues, including the NFL, and media outlets like ESPN. Statistician Frank Labombarda kindly crunched the numbers for us.\n\nFor the non-sports junkies, rushing basically measures the progress a team moves down the field. And yards per rush is simply rushing yards divided by rushing attempts.\n\nHow has Lynch performed in the playoffs? He has rushed 109 times for 560 yards or an average of 5.1 yards per rush. (Nearly 12 percent of Lynch\u2019s playoff yards came on one . That one run raises Lynch\u2019s average rush by more than half a yard.)\n\nThat is indeed less than former Davis, the former Denver Broncos running back, who averaged a whopping 5.6 yards per rush over 204 carries.\n\nBut Lynch's numbers also fall below a host of other NFL players, we found. Here's a sampling:\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTurns out, Klatt missed a key qualifier: players who have a minimum of 100 rushing attempts. \"You have to say minimum 100 attempts,\" Labombarda said. \"There are lots of guys who have higher averages.\"\n\nAmong players with a minimum of 100 attempts, Lynch is currently second, Labombarda said. The Seahawks running back is sandwiched between Davis -- at 5.6 yards -- and former Los Angeles Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs running back , who played for 16 seasons and in 15 playoff games, averaging 5 yards per rush in the postseason.\n\nKlatt said Marshawn Lynch is \"second all-time in terms of average yards per rush only to Terrell Davis.\"\n\nWhen counting all NFL players, Klatt is wrong. But he is on solid ground when calculating for players who have run the ball at least 100 times in the playoffs. Klatt\u2019s statement is partially accurate. So we rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
