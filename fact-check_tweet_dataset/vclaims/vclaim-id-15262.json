Even Indian cricketer, Virender Sehwag has shared a similar post on his Twitter account. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: Emanuel Eminiki has married Iheoma Nnadi in 2018. She was the winner of the Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria contest in 2014, not Miss Nigeria. Eminiki has never married before this wedding. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the wedding of Emanuel Eminiki on Google, it was found that similar posts were shared on various platforms with different years. According to the Pulse article, Eminiki was never married before his wedding with Iheoma Nnadi. They got married last year in May but before that, they had a daughter in 2017. Also, Iheoma Nnadi was not Miss Nigeria 2017 or 2018 but she was the winner of the \u2018Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria\u2019 contest in 2014. This all started with the post of Reekado Banks, a Nigerian Singer, which was deleted later after a serious reply from Eminiki to remove the post.\n\nIn fact, both the pictures in the post are from the pre-wedding shoot of Emanuel Eminiki and Iheoma Nnadi. They are available on the official account of the Photographer\u2019s Facebook page. These pictures were also reported by multiple african news outlets here and here.\n\n\n\nFinally, Emanuel Eminiki has neither married Miss Nigeria 2017 nor married Miss Nigeria 2018.", "lang": "en"}
