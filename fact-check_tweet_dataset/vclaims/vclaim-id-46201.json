Alt News has caught @Satynistha spreading misinformation on numerous occasions in the past. (archive link)\n\nTwitter user @PMPATEl1969 also shared the viral video along with the same Hindi. This video has been retweeted over 600 times (archive link). Similarly, a Facebook user also shared the viral video along with the same Hindi text. This has been viewed over 4,000 times (archive link).\n\nAlt News received several requests to fact-check the viral video on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News analysed the video using InVid, an online video verification tool and performed a reverse image search on Yandex. One of the searches revealed that the viral video was also shared with Hindi text, \u201c\u0905\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0940 \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u0947\u091f\u0940 \u0926\u094b\u0928\u094b \u092a\u0915\u095c\u0940 \u0917\u0908 , \u0926\u0947\u0916 \u0932\u094b \u0907\u0928\u0915\u093e \u0915\u093e\u092e\u201c.\n\nUsing this as a clue, we performed a keyword search on Facebook and found that the page India News had shared with the video with the title \u2018\u0905\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0940 \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u0947\u091f\u0940 \u0926\u094b\u0928\u094b \u092a\u0915\u095c\u0940 \u0917\u0908 , \u0926\u0947\u0916 \u0932\u094b \u0907\u0928\u0915\u093e \u0915\u093e\u092e \u2013 Entertainment Video\u2019 on March 4. The video has a staggering 5.8 million views and over 62,000 shares. (archive link)\n\nAfter rummaging through the results of another reverse image search, we found that the viral video was also published by a Pakistan-based YouTube channel on July 20, 2019. The title reads, \u2018Karachi young girl drug dealer arrested (Translated from \u06a9\u0631\u0627\u0686\u06cc \u0645\u0646\u0634\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0631\u0648\u0634 \u0646\u0648\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0691\u06a9\u06cc \u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0631 ).\u2019\n\nWe found several other Pakistani users who had shared the video last year.\n\nWhile we could not independently verify if the video is from Pakistan, the claim associated with the video is false and misleading. Alt News was able to trace the video back to July 2019, thus proving that it cannot depict a recent incident in Shaheen Bagh.", "lang": "en"}
