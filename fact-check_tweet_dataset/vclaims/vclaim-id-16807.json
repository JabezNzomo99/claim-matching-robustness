But she said \u201cinformally the Chechen authorities admit that the numbers of Chechens leaving for the Middle East are very high and they are unable to prevent their outflow.\u201d\n\nAs to how the numbers of Chechens in IS compare with those from other nations, a report from Northwestern University in April 2016 said there are 150 to 250 U.S. foreign fighters, approximately 2,000 Asian fighters, between 5,000 and 5,400 European fighters, 2,000 to 3,000 African fighters, and 120 to 225 Australian fighters.\n\nThe numbers in the study contradict Kadyrov\u2019s claim of \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people joining IS in Syria and Iraq from abroad.\n\n\u201cObviously there are, for a start, not \u2018hundreds of thousands\u2019 in any case,\u201d Mark Galeotti, a senior research fellow at the Institute of International Relations Prague, told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cAt its peak, the serious estimates for IS across both Syria and Iraq range from 40,000 to 100,000,\u201d he said of the total number of IS fighters including Arab and foreign fighters.\n\nPentagon officials said last week that 50,000 IS fighters have been killed by a U.S.-led offensive since 2014 and an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 IS fighters remain in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAnd numbers do not solely tell the story of the significance of Chechens in fighting for IS. After years spent fighting Russians, Chechens found success in IS ranks as several took on leadership roles and are credited with helping in the initial success of IS.", "lang": "en"}
