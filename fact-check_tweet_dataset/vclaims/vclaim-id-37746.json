Other names used to describe it include Hellfire bean or itchy bean; Agbala or Agbaloko to the Igbos; Karara in Hausa and Werepe in Yoruba.\n\nIt is an annual climbing shrub with long vines that can reach over 15 m in length. It is almost completely covered with fuzzy hairs; but when older, it is almost completely free of hairs.\n\nWhere can it be found?\n\nMucuna Pruriens or velvet bean is present in tropical parts of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. It is known for its valuable medicinal properties and has been investigated in various contexts for its anti-diabetic, aphrodisiac, anti-epileptic and anti-microbial properties.\n\nMucuna Pruriens (MP) is also a herbal drug that manages male infertility, nervous disorders, and a potent aphrodisiac. This may in part be due to its antiparkinson and neuroprotective effects, which also stem from its antioxidizing nature. Indeed ancient Indian medical systems used this as a herbal drug to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nAdditionally, velvet bean is a known anti-venom drug. Practitioners attest to this, adding that it can offer a year-long protection when its seed is swallowed intact. Some of these instances are native to Nigeria, Plateau State to be exact. Furthermore, it\u2019s anti-nutritional factors such as protease inhibitors render anti-diabetic effects.\n\nRegardless of all these health benefits, there are a few no-nos. The bean pod should not be applied directly on the skin or eaten as the hair on the velvet bean pod is UNSAFE. It is a strong irritant and can cause severe itching, burning, and swelling. This, however, does not to apply to special preparations by specialists.\n\nThe chemical compounds responsible for the itch are the protein mucunain and serotonin.\n\nInterestingly, extracts of MP methanolic show a downregulation of protein expression and suppression of 4HNE in human keratinocytes (cells formed on the outer skin- keratin constitutes over 90% of the epidermis). These relate to skin diseases and their cellular manifestations. This is the basis for preliminary studies that are investigating the effect of MP methanolic extract on skin diseases such as Psoriasis, Dermatitis and Eczema.\n\nThe hypothesis surmised that since most skin conditions are a result of oxidative stress on toxins; given that MP is antioxidizing in nature, it must have potential as a skin remedy.\n\nHowever, there is currently no concrete study by \u201cscientists\u201d, contrary to the user\u2019s views. These are still preliminary findings!\n\nVelvet bean shows great promise as a herbal drug, not as a skincare product. We advise you NOT to apply it directly on the skin, other than the aforementioned usage (doctor\u2019s prescription). It will NOT lighten the skin, cure eczema, remove black spots, soften or nourish the body. It will, however, cause serious itching!", "lang": "en"}
