The post was published alongside Chinese text which claims it was filmed in the United States. The claim is false; the video actually shows Dutch police detaining a woman in the Netherlands.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on February 23, 2020. It has since been shared more than 400 times.\n\nThe two-minute 33-second video features simplified Chinese subtitles which translate to English as: \u201cSee how the American police enforce the law. Looks far more powerful than that of Chinese police. American human rights? Human rights are restricted. Police will still beat and arrest even though passers-by take photos. Passers-by hide far away. The United States has democracy, while its law is enforced strictly.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video was also shared online in mid-2019, alongside a similar claim, as Hong Kong experienced widespread political unrest. The posts suggest that Hong Kong police are far more gentle than their US counterparts. Examples can be seen on Facebook here, and on Weibo here and here.\n\nSimilar footage claiming the incident shows police in the US was also published on Facebook here and here, on Twitter here in 2018, on Weibo here in 2019, also on YouTube here in February 2020.\n\nReverse image searches of keyframes extracted from the video found this article published on June 1, 2018 by Rijnmond, a Dutch media news organisation.\n\nThe Dutch article's headline translates to English as: \u201cPolice respond to video crackdown\u201d. It features video and photos that correspond to the footage shared in the misleading post, and reports that the incident occured in Stadhuisplein, a popular night spot in Rotterdam.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:\n\nA subsequent keyword search found this official statement from the Dutch police which states the incident happened in Stadhuisplein on the night of May 30, 2018.\n\n\u201cAggressive drunk couple arrested on Stadhuisplein,\u201d the statement is titled.\n\nThe statement goes on to describe the incident captured on video, noting that the woman \u201cwas pushed by one of the agents and fell to the ground\u201d and later \u201chit a cop in the face.\u201d The arresting officer, the statement adds, \u201cused violence\u201d to subdue the woman.\n\nThe incident sparked controversy and accusations of excessive force by police, according to this report published by Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad on June 1, 2018.\n\nGoogle Street View imagery of the Stadhuisplein in Rotterdam also matches the video shared on social media.", "lang": "en"}
