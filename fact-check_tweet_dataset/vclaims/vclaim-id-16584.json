Also, it may encourage the removal of toxins from the body.\u201d\n\nThe article claims \u201cthe foot has more than 7,000 nerve endings\u201d that are \u201cassociated with other body areas like the heart, sinuses, and brain\u201d. Putting onions on the feet means \u201ctheir health benefits are quickly dispersed throughout important organs in a short amount of time\u201d.\n\n, the chair and professor of the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at Iowa State University in the US, i\n\n\u201cOnions... are slightly acidic, which could have antibacterial effects,\u201d she said. \u201cBut these are much less effective than bleach or chemical antibiotics. Eating these vegetables provides antioxidants that can have health benefits, but they are unlikely to prevent or cure disease.\u201d\n\nreported that \u201cthe claim that onions are \u2018toxin absorbers\u2019 is pseudo-scientific nonsense\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have not found a single scientific source stating that onions absorb \u2018toxins\u2019 of any kind, much less those specifically related to diseases,\u201d the\n\nhas also researched the claim, and rated it\n\n. \u201cThe topical application of some chemicals in onions could kill bacteria externally,\u201d Snopes says. But sticking onions on your feet will not create \u201cany change to the internal systems of one\u2019s body, as claimed\u201d.\n\nThe evidence presented to support this fairly outlandish notion is either false or misleading, and we cannot find any plausible mechanism for a raw cut onion stuffed in your sock to reduce any disease.\u201d\n\nreport says the claim is \u201cbased on anecdote rather than research\u201d.\n\nAnother common claim is that a cut raw onion left in a room will remove toxins from the air.\n\nBut the US\n\nsays this is a folk tale \u201cthat dates back as far as 1500s\u201d. The thinking was that \u201cplacing a cut raw onion in rooms throughout a residence could protect its occupants from getting the bubonic plague\u201d.\n\nBefore germs were discovered, \u201cthe dominant belief was that contagious diseases were spread by \u2018noxious\u2019 air. While false, this belief maintained part of folk medicine,\u201d the\n\nOnions do have health benefits, the NOA says. \u201c\n\nOnions are high in vitamin C and are a good source of fibre and other key nutrients. Onions are fat free and low in calories, yet add abundant flavour to a wide variety of foods.\u201d\n\nalso advises that \u201cstrapping an onion to your foot certainly will not take away your illness\u201d and \u201cleaving cut onion around the room won\u2019t do the trick\u201d either.\n\n\u201cOnions may indeed have some properties beneficial to your health, but to reap such benefits, you actually have to eat them.\u201d -", "lang": "en"}
