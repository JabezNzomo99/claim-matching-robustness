The claim is false; the fight was actually between the speaker and deputy of the House of Representatives in Somaliland \u2013 not Somalia \u2013 and it took place in 2015.\n\nNairobi governor Mike Sonko shared the video in this post on Facebook with the caption \u201cSomali President exchanges blows with his Deputy\u201d. Since August 14, 2020, it has had more than 150,000 views, 2,000 shares and more than 1,500 comments.\n\nSeveral other Facebook posts (here, here, here and here) made the same claims.\n\nArticles published in Zimbabwe here and Nigeria here purported that the fight was between Somalia\u2019s President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo and the country\u2019s acting prime minister, Mahdi Mohamed Guled.\n\nAccording to the reports, \u201cthe Somalia president suddenly stood up during a press conference and started punching his deputy\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is not yet understood what led to the altercation because the two were holding hands and the next thing, fists were flying,\u201d one of the articles reads.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook posts in French (here, here and here) claimed that the clash involved Somalia\u2019s president and the speaker of the country\u2019s national assembly.\n\nHowever, all of these claims are false.\n\nA close look at the video reveals the words \u201cshirgudoonka golaha wakiilada\u201d written on a sign in front of one of the men\u2019s seats. This is written in Somali -- a language that is spoken in both Somalia and Somaliland -- and translates to \u201cthe speaker of the House of Representatives\u201d.\n\nThe flag that appears behind the two men is not Somalia\u2019s, which features a white star on a blue background. It corresponds to the flag of Somaliland, a self-proclaimed state on the edge of the Horn of Africa, which gained independence from Somalia in 1991. Somaliland is not recognised by the international community.\n\nA search using the video verification tool WeVerify revealed that the clip is not recent. AFP Fact Check found stills from the video used in an article published in 2015 on the Aftahan News site, which covers news from Somaliland.\n\nThe article, written in Somali and published on September 12, 2015, described the video as showing \u201cclashes (...) between the speaker and the deputy speaker of the House of Representatives of Somaliland Abdirahman Mohamed Abdillahi (Cirro) and Bashe Mohamed Farah\u201d.\n\nFarah (in a black shirt with short sleeves) succeeded Abdillahi in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe altercation took place after an argument over a motion concerning the management of fuel tanks in the port of Berbera in Somaliland,\u201d Mustafa Haji Abdinur, AFP\u2019s correspondent in Somalia, told AFP Fact Check.\n\nThe president of the separatist state had initially hired a company to manage the fuel tanks, but parliament subsequently revoked his decision. Thirty-three lawmakers tabled a motion to reverse parliament\u2019s decision, but Abdillahi, as the speaker of the house, ruled that the debate was closed.\n\nFarah then took the microphone to announce that discussions could continue. From there, the fight broke out, according to Abdinur from AFP.", "lang": "en"}
