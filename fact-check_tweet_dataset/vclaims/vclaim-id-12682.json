The post appeared on an apparent joke site but some people appeared to believe it was true. A reverse image search reveals that the picture was taken in 2016 when police threw teargas at a high school.\n\nThe Facebook post attracted over 5000 comments and more than 10,000 reactions when shared on this Facebook Page that has 1.2 million followers.\n\nThe photo shows a distressed male student carrying a female student, who appears to be lifeless or unconscious, at Nairobi\u2019s Silver Spring Secondary School in the Kibera slum.\n\nA caption accompanying the image on the misleading post implores the public to send their condolence messages to the family of the allegedly dead student.\n\n\"Only the heartless will ignore this. May her saw (soul, sic) rest in peace, she died after her mathematics exams. Don't scroll without typing....R.I.P,\" the caption read.\n\nIn the \u201cAbout\u201d section of the Facebook page it is described as \u201cjust for laughs\u201d but some of comments appeared to take the post seriously, showing concern for the girl.\n\nA reverse image search on Google and Yandex search engines revealed that the image was first taken in May 2016 during protests held in Kibera to push for electoral reforms in the country.\n\nThe demonstrations, reported in several publications, were spearheaded by the opposition Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) which held that the electoral body must be reconstituted before a general election in 2017.\n\nAs police officers were dispersing the protesters, they fired tear gas into the school\u2019s compound, causing the girl in the photo to collapse, according to Katie G. Nelson, the reporter who took the picture in May 2016.\n\nWhile this image is not of a student who died during exams, the Nation last week reported that a male student at Gesiaga Secondary school in the west of the country died after taking a mathematics exam. The student is said to have suffered a heart-related ailment.", "lang": "en"}
