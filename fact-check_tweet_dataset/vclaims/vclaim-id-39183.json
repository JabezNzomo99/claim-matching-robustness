Only the Quran has the cure for Coronavirus. Undoubtedly.'\n\nBOOM found that the clip begins and ends abruptly and has been created by splicing together separate parts of the voiceover to make up a false narrative.\n\n\n\nAlso read: Nigerian Driver Threatening To Spread Coronavirus Across The Country?\n\nThe posts can be seen below and its archived versions can be accessed here, and here.\n\nThe clip is widely viral on Twitter as well.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or (SARS-CoV), and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome or (MERS-CoV). Novel Coronavirus or (COVID-19) is a newly emerged strain of the virus. COVID-19 has killed over 3,300 people worldwide and was first reported in China's Wuhan city.\n\n\n\nAlso read: No, The Chinese PM Did Not Visit A Mosque To Protect Himself From Coronavirus\n\nYou can track the recent updates here.\n\nBOOM looked at the video and found several indications about it being a 'Viral Test', Aaj Tak's show where it debunks false claims. The faded stamp on the video can be seen clearly. We found the original video clip which is a four-minute-long video of the 'Viral Test' bulletin of AajTak.\n\nWith other discrepancies in the viral clip such as parts where the anchor says \"a post is viral on Facebook\" and \"claim is that reciting Quran can treat coronavirus\" have been removed.\n\nWe compared the screenshots of both the videos and found numerous differences.\n\nThe original video clip is a four-minute-long bulletin, whereas the viral clip is only 30-second-long. The anchor in the original video has clearly stated that the claims are 'viral on Facebook with a video that shows Chinese prime minister visited a mosque and recited Namaaz', on the contrary, the viral clip has only those parts where anchor is either reading the claim or saying that he is Chinese prime minister to make it sound like the anchor is making a claim.\n\n\n\nThe claim that he is the Chinese prime minister is factually incorrect. Xi Jinping is the president of China wheres the individual in the video is ex-Malaysian prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. This was also shown in the AajTak bulletin at the timestamp 2.50 minute.\n\n\n\nBOOM had already debunked the claim where a 2015 video of a former Malaysian prime minister praying at a mosque in China was being shared with false claims that the China Prime Minister Li Keqiang is seeking protection from Coronavirus by praying at a mosque.
