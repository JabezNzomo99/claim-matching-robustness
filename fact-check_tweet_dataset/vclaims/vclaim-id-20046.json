The story was also republished by the Natural Healing Magazine web site in July 2016.\n\nThe story carries the headline: \u201cDr. Gallo: \u2018I Invented AIDS to Depopulate Humanity\u201d and claims:\n\nYour News Wire, in turn, cites the \u201cDaily Post\u201d as having written a series of somewhat incoherent paragraphs characterized by spelling, grammar and syntax errors.\n\nQuite apart from all that, Dr. Robert Gallo has never \u201cadmitted that he created AIDS in order to reduce the world\u2019s population,\u201d or made any statement remotely to that effect.
