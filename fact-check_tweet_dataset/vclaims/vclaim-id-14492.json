In the image, PM Modi can be seen with FIFA president Gianni Infantino who is holding a jersey with the words \u2018Modi 420 living football FIFA\u2019. PM Modi was on a three-day tour to Argentina to attend the G-20 summit, whose closing ceremony was on December 1. This photo, posted on the Faceook group We Support Shehla Rashid, has been shared over 2600 times already. The group has over 87,000 members.\n\nThe photograph has also been posted by a page Jumla Express with the message, \u201c\u091c\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0917\u0940 \u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f \u0915\u0930 \u0939\u0940 \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0938\u0939\u0940 \u091f\u0940 \u0936\u0930\u094d\u091f \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 #Modi420\u2033 (Life has a way of meting out justice. An appropriate t-shirt has been given. #Modi420- translated). At the time of writing, this post had been shared over 4500 times. The page has more than 6 lakh followers.\n\nThe image is viral on Facebook with the claim that FIFA president has gifted this jersey with \u2018420\u2019 written on it. The number is popularly synonymous with fraud. Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) concerns itself with fraud, theft and deception. The image has been shared by several social media users, mocking the Prime Minister.\n\nThe image viral on social media is photoshopped. The original text \u2018G20\u2019 which is present in the image has been replaced with \u2018420\u2019.\n\nWhen Alt News reverse searched the image on Google, it came across the original image which was posted on the official Facebook account of PM Modi, on December 1. The post by PM Modi\u2019s page thanks FIFA President Gianni Infantino for the football jersey. It says, \u201cImpossible to come to Argentina and not think about football. Argentinian players are tremendously popular in India. Today, received this jersey from FIFA President Gianni Infantino. I thank him for the kind gesture.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time that PM Modi has been targeted through photoshopped images. Recently, a photoshopped picture of a woman seated next to PM Modi was viral on social media.", "lang": "en"}
