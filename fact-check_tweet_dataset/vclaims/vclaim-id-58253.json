He said:\n\n\u201cIt has been transpiring that the current pandemic \u2013 as I have been told and also, I watched some programs I was sent via WhatsApp yesterday \u2013 is, after all, a bluff. If this pandemic turns out to be a bluff, what would you say then? If it becomes established that this pandemic is a trick, and the world admits that it is a bluff, will that not prove the truth of what that bishop said!\u201d\n\nDescribing the pandemic as a \u201cbluff\u201d or \u201ctrick\u201d is false.\n\nThe global scientific community has joined forces to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 respiratory syndrome. While the world awaits the results, a segment of the Georgian clergy has begun questioning the vaccine and the benefits of vaccinations in general.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has been promoting anti-vaccination conspiracy theories targeting billionaire tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Bill Gates. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation plans to build factories to produce the COVID-19 vaccine once it is ready.\n\nAmong the bogus Gates conspiracy theories are claims that he wants to inject people with surveillance microchips and knew about the pandemic before it emerged in December.\n\nIn fact, Gates has advocated for pandemic preparedness for years. His foundation has spent millions on the prevention and treatment of contagious diseases and distributed vaccines in developing countries.\n\nIn his 2015 TED talk, given amid the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, Gates warned that a highly infectious virus, rather than a nuclear war, would be the greatest global catastrophe that could claim millions of lives.\n\nAfter the outbreak of COVID-19, Gates contributed a quarter billion dollars to several coronavirus vaccine initiatives.\n\nIn April, Georgian media outlets sympathetic to Russia made conspiratorial references to an \u201cEvent 201 exercise\u201d and \u201cInnovating to zero\u201d in an apparent attempt to prove that Bill Gates knew about the coronavirus outbreak in advance. \u201cEvent 201\u201d was a tabletop exercise, co-hosted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in October 2019, to illustrate the need for pandemic preparedness.\n\nNo evidence exists tying this exercise to the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOther Georgian Orthodox Church clerics have also made misleading claims. On May 3, one stated that if COVID-19 \u201cprovokes death of people that does not mean that the virus killed them but that the time for them to pass away has come.\u201d\n\nAnother cleric claimed on May 6 that COVID-19 does not directly kill people but instead aggravates underlying diseases that kill them. That is misleading: many of those with COVID-19 who have died did not have underlying or complicating conditions.\n\nThe Georgian clergy has been defiant since the start of the outbreak, when the Georgian Orthodox Church rejected a recommendation to give holy communion using disposable rather than shared spoons. \u201cWine, which turns into blood after it is poured into the chalice, is a natural antiseptic. A spoon cleansed in wine becomes free of bacteria. Dipping [the spoon] in wine is the same as dipping in alcohol,\u201d Bishop Nikoloz (Pachuashvili) of the Akhalkalaki, Kumurdo and Kars Eparchy of the Georgian Orthodox Church said on March 1.\n\nThe World Health Organization says only hand sanitizers with more than 60 percent alcohol effectively kill the virus. The alcohol content of wine is 20 percent or lower.\n\nAlthough the Georgian Orthodox Church required social distancing during the Easter holidays, it continues to give holy communion with a shared spoon.\n\nOn May 10, Bishop Gerasime of the Zugdidi and Tsaishi Eparchy of the Georgian Orthodox Church said that while the church cannot accept the vaccine outright, it will take the matter up for discussion. \u201cA commission will be set up to consider and discuss these topics, whether it is positive, negative, acceptable or unacceptable and then we will take a decision,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the WHO, vaccines prevented at least 10 million deaths between 2010 and 2015 and protected many millions more lives from illness.", "lang": "en"}
