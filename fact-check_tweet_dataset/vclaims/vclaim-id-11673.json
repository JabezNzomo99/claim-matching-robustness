In four of the seven countries less than half of people would be \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with a female head of government, according to Kantar\u2019s findings.\n\nIn the UK, the published figures show 58% of people would feel \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with a female head of government.\n\nBut it\u2019s not correct to say based on this that 58% are \u201ccomfortable\u201d. Nor is it correct to assume that everyone who didn\u2019t say they were \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with a female leader is uncomfortable. Here\u2019s why:\n\n9% of UK adults surveyed said they were uncomfortable with a female leader\n\nKantar told us that the exact question asked was:\n\n\u201cHow comfortable do you or would you personally feel about having a woman as the head of government in your country?\u201d\n\nThat hypothetical phrasing was used even if the country actually had a female head of government\u2014as is the case in the UK and Germany. (And it\u2019s possible that fact in itself would have influenced the results in those countries).\n\nThe answers respondents could choose from ranged from very or fairly comfortable to not very or not at all comfortable. They could also choose \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019.\n\nSo respondents could choose a range of options to express how comfortable with a female leader they were.\n\nThe report by Kantar shows us that many people answered \u201cvery comfortable\u201d but not how many answered with the other options. So although 58% of people in the UK were \u2018very comfortable\u2019 with the idea of a female head of government, the proportion that were either fairly or very comfortable was higher.\n\nBy the same reasoning, you also can\u2019t infer from the published data how many people in each country would be uncomfortable with a female head of state.\n\nKantar gave us the full UK results to the question. These showed that in the UK, 58% of people said they were \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with a female leader and another 29% said they were \u201cfairly comfortable\u201d. 9% said they were not very or not at all comfortable.\n\n79% of adults in the G7 think men and women are equally suited to leadership positions in government and politics\n\nThere\u2019s a limit to how much the data can tell us about attitudes towards women as heads of government across the G7. Kantar didn\u2019t ask respondents how they would feel about having a male head of government\u2014so we can\u2019t compare the two sets of figures.\n\nIt also didn\u2019t ask any follow up questions as to why people were comfortable (or not) with women as heads of government\u2014for example if it was linked to their gender, the performance of particular high profile politicians, or a general distrust of politicians.\n\nKantar did ask respondents whether they thought men or women are more suitable for leadership positions in government and politics more widely (rather than as the out-and-out head of state).\n\nIt found that while between 23% and 58% of adults in each G7 country felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with a female head of government, a far higher number (79% ) of adults felt men and women are equally suited to leadership positions in government and politics.\n\n8% felt women were more suited to these positions than men and 13% felt men were more suited than women.", "lang": "en"}
