The claim is misleading; the photos, while all taken inside the House of Representatives chamber, were all miscaptioned; in Australia, MPs' pay and allowances are set by an independent body, not the MPs themselves.\n\nThis meme has been shared more than 1,000 times since it was posted to Facebook on December 16, 2019.\n\nThe caption of the Facebook post states: \"Until we change the people on both sides we won't see better outcomes, anyone else interested?\"\n\nThe text superimposed at the top of the meme reads : \u201cWhy changes to Legislation is so difficult.\"\n\nThe meme has included eight images taken inside the Australian House of Representatives chamber alongside captions that purport to describe the corresponding policy debates shown in the photo.\n\nThe photos that claim to show debates on PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) in emergency services, mental health stigma, workers compensation, PFAS contamination, cancer legislation for firefighters and suicide figures in Australia feature sparse attendance.\n\nWhile in the two images captioned \"Debating MP's Pay\" and \"Debating MP's Allowances\", the chamber appears to be full.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nOther Facebook posts featuring the meme can be found here and here.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the photographs are miscaptioned.
