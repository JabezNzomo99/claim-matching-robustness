Scott Walker did an on April 25, 2015 with Caffeinated Thoughts, a website that says it looks at \"culture, current events, faith and politics from a Christian and conservative point of view.\"\n\nWhen Walker was asked about his position on immigration reform, he began his answer by saying:\n\n\"Number of things. Border security for sure. Unlike this president, I\u2019ve actually gone to the border and been there with the governor of Texas,\" Walker said, referring to a trip he made a month earlier.\n\nImmigration has long been a huge national issue. Barack Obama has been president for more than six years.\n\nIs Walker right that Obama has never been to the Texas-Mexico border?\n\nAshLee Strong, spokeswoman for Our American Revival, the group Walker created in anticipation of a campaign for president, responded to our request for information to back Walker\u2019s statement.\n\nShe essentially tried to modify the governor\u2019s claim by narrowing the time frame, saying Obama \"chose not to go to the border while he was in Texas in 2014 during a humanitarian crisis\" at the border.\n\nWalker, of course, made a much broader claim.\n\nBut let\u2019s start with his evidence: a July 9, 2014 CBS News .\n\nOn the day the report was posted online, Obama arrived in Texas for a previously planned two-day trip that was to involve talking to Texans about the economy and attending Democratic fundraisers.\n\nAt the time, there had been a surge in the number children and teens from Central America crossing the Mexico-U.S. border unaccompanied by a parent.\n\nMany of the youths fled drug violence at home, but faced new challenges in the United States because the border patrol system wasn\u2019t equipped to handle them, according to . Changes in policy to expand legal residence opportunities in the United States for undocumented youth may have led some families to send younger family members on the journey north.\n\nBecause of the crisis at the border, Obama altered his plans to include a meeting, in Dallas, with then-Gov. Rick Perry and local officials to discuss the situation at the border. But Obama -- resisting calls from lawmakers in both parties -- did not visit the border, although several senior members of his administration had done so.\n\nMore to the point of Walker\u2019s claim, however, the news report he cited also said Obama had visited the border in May 2011.\n\nWe found that Obama visited El Paso on May 10, 2011. (Our colleagues his statement during his speech there that the Border Patrol had doubled the number of its agents since 2004.)\n\nA Washington Post on the speech said Obama was \"standing within sight of Mexico\" and that it was his his trip to the U.S.-Mexico border as president.\n\nThat was his only visit to the border as president.\n\nWalker said that \"unlike this president, I've actually gone to the (Texas) border.\"\n\nObama certainly hasn\u2019t been a frequent visitor, but as president he did go to the border once, in May 2011 to give a speech on immigration reform.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.\n\nFor profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.", "lang": "en"}
