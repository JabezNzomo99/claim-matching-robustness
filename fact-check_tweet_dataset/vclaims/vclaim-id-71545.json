The image is real and went viral in 2012 -- however, it was not taken in South Africa, but at a bank in India.\n\nThe Facebook post, which we\u2019ve archived here, was posted on June 25 and reads: \u201cDurban Home Affairs\u201d.\n\nComments on the post were mixed, with some believing the picture was really taken in Durban, South Africa.\n\nBut another user cast doubt on the photo. \u201cIs this legitimate? The nationality of the people seems more Asian\u201d, reads the comment by Sabelo Kotswana.\n\nDurban is known for having residents of many cultural backgrounds, including a diverse Indian population.\n\nKotswana also did a reverse image search and found three links related to India, which led him to believe the post was misleading.\n\nThis 2017 article on the Indian website OfficeChai includes the photo, saying it showed \u201can SBI (State Bank of India) cashier playing a card game on her computer as harried customers waited in line\u201d. It \u201chad gone viral many years ago\u201d, the article adds.\n\nThe image can be found posted on Imgur in 2012 and then again in a Reddit discussion in a post claiming that it was taken at a vehicle registration office in India.\n\nHowever, other Reddit users correctly noted that it wasn\u2019t taken at a vehicle registration office.\n\nOne user noticed markings on the back of the woman\u2019s chair -- \u201cSBI/IND/CAH/157\u201d -- and a \u201cdistinctive\u201d pale blue booklet propped up on the counter that they recognised from the bank.\n\nAFP\u2019s Fact Check team in India helped us look into the detail on the chair and suggested it may show a banking reference code.\n\nUnder the coding system, SBI stands for State Bank of India and IND for India. A search for the full code appearing on the back of the chair returns links relating to the bank.\n\nOnline searches of the SBI booklet also resemble the book propped up against the window, as the Reddit user suggested.\n\nA Bailley water bottle produced by Parl\u00e9 Agro in India can also be seen on the window counter.\n\nWe haven\u2019t yet been able to track down the exact SBI branch in India where the photo was taken -- if you have any leads, you can contact us here.", "lang": "en"}
