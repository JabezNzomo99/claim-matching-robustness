But it was more tightly cropped than the original video and edited to slow Pelosi\u2019s speech, making it appear that she was slurring her words.\n\nTens of thousands of Facebook users shared the distorted clip, which received more than 2 million views. Many users spread the video by posting comments advancing the false claim that she was \u201cdrunk\u201d \u2014 mirroring a claim made in the caption of a YouTube version of the video, which was widely shared before being removed by the platform.\n\nThe same portion of Pelosi\u2019s full exchange with Neera Tanden, CAP\u2019s president, makes clear to viewers that the viral version was doctored. In fact, the 3-minute and 7-second doctored version adds more than 40 seconds to the same section of the interview as seen on C-SPAN and CAP\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nMaura Shea, an associate teaching professor of film-video and media studies at Penn State, said in an interview that the length added to the version on Facebook, as opposed to the one on C-SPAN, is one sign of its manipulated nature: \u201cTime is time.\u201d\n\nThe sound, too, of the Facebook copy shows signs of editing \u2014 notably a \u201ctin can or a swirling sound in the background\u201d that\u2019s especially apparent in the moments when Pelosi is not talking, Shea said.\n\n\u201cIt can happen when you digitally slow something down and you don\u2019t want the pitch to change,\u201d Shea said. \u201cWhich is normally what would happen with a slowed down clip.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe added: \u201cYou\u2019re making frames that don\u2019t exist so they don\u2019t sound perfectly clean.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Pelosi told FactCheck.org that Pelosi does not drink \u2014 something we were also told by staff in 2010 \u2014 and noted that Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani shared the video on Twitter before deleting it. Giuliani seemingly referred to the video again on Twitter Friday, calling it a \u201ccaricature exaggerating her already halting speech pattern.\u201d\n\nPelosi and Trump have exchanged jabs following the president\u2019s walkout from a planned infrastructure meeting on May 22.\n\nA day later, Trump shared a Fox Business segment that was critical of Pelosi\u2019s speaking during a press conference that day. \u201cPELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE,\u201d he wrote. That video does not appear to be distorted, but instead uses selective clips of her full exchange with reporters.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

First she should withdraw her charge which hurts our entire nation when she says the President needs an \u2018intervention. \u2018People who live in a glass house shouldn\u2019t throw stones.\u2019\u201d Twitter. 24 May 2019.\n\nShea, Maura.
