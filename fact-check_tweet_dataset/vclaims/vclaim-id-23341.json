A well-crafted \u201cemergency procedure\u201d known as \u201ccough CPR\u201d continues to attract attention on social media.\n\nCPR is cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a lifesaving procedure performed when the heart stops beating.\n\nwith over 10 million followers claims life-saving strategies for people having a heart attack while alone include coughing repeatedly and vigorously.\n\n\u201cA deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest,\u201d\n\nIt adds that a breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let-up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again.\n\nDeep breaths, according to the article, help get oxygen into the lungs and coughing squeezes the heart and keeps the blood circulating.\n\nIt says the squeezing pressure on the heart helps it regain normal rhythm, giving the victim time to get to a hospital.\n\nThe article concludes by asking the readers to share it as much as possible \u201cas instructed by a cardiologist\u201d.\n\nAnd, indeed, the article has been shared more than 67,000 times, also attracting 8,500 reactions and 1,700 comments.\n\n, a heart attack occurs when the blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart muscle is severely reduced or cut off completely.\n\nthat this happens because the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood can become narrowed from a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances that together are called plaque.\n\n\u201cWhen plaque within a heart artery breaks, a blood clot forms around the plaque. This blood clot can block the blood flow through the artery to the heart muscle,\u201d it says.\n\nWhen the heart muscle is starved for oxygen and nutrients due to restricted or reduced blood flow, it gets damaged or dies. This is a heart attack.\n\nthat heart attack and cardiac arrest are two different terms, incorrectly used interchangeably.\n\n\u201cA heart attack is when blood flow to the heart is blocked, and sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating unexpectedly. A heart attack is a \u2018circulation\u2019 problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an \u2018electrical\u2019 problem,\u201d the article says.\n\nCan coughing save your life during a heart attack?\n\nAlthough it may be possible for a conscious, responsive person to cough forcefully and repetitively to maintain enough blood flow to the brain to remain conscious for a few seconds until an abnormal heart rhythm is treated, the American Heart Association says the procedure is not useful for unresponsive victims and should not be taught to ordinary people.\n\n\u201cThe American Heart Association does not endorse \u2018cough CPR\u2019, a coughing procedure widely publicised on the internet,\u201d says an\n\nThe procedure has also been denounced by the UK\u2019s\n\n. The organisation aims to promote high-quality and scientific resuscitation guidelines and help save lives with education, training, research and collaboration.\n\nOn its website, the council\n\nabout the \u201cincorrect advice\u201d articles on \u201ccough CPR\u201d given to people. It warns that the procedure could in fact cause more harm.\n\n\u201cCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the correct treatment for sudden cardiac arrest, which is when the heart suddenly stops pumping. The majority of people having a heart attack will not suffer a cardiac arrest, and by attempting \u2018cough CPR\u2019 they could make their condition worse,\u201d\n\n\u201cThe correct advice for anyone who thinks they may be having a heart attack is to call immediately for an emergency ambulance and, whilst waiting for the ambulance to arrive, follow advice from the ambulance call handler.\u201d\n\nin the US and co-author of the paper \u201cVariable outcomes of human heart attack recapitulated in genetically diverse mice\u201d\n\nHe said it\u2019s simply not true that the procedure would help a victim survive a heart attack.\n\n\u201cThe claim that \u2018cough CPR\u2019 helps to survive a heart attack is an absolute myth. If you become unresponsive, it is rather unlikely that you can perform this procedure,\u201d he told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThe best way to survive a heart attack is to know the symptoms and call the hospital or an emergency hotline immediately.\u201d\n\nsays the symptoms of an impending heart attack may include:\n\u2022 None Chest discomfort where people may feel pain, heaviness, tightness, pressure or a crushing sensation in the centre of their chest.\n\u2022 None Discomfort in other areas of the upper body. Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.\n\u2022 None Shortness of breath where people may find it difficult to breathe or to take a deep breath due to a tight or constricted feeling in the chest. \n\n\n\n\n\nOther possible signs include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea or light-headedness. The website says the best way to deal with a possible heart attack is to rest immediately, tell someone how you feel and seek immediate medical attention.", "lang": "en"}
