Both are leading world cities and because they have very similar populations, statistics about them can often be compared fairly easily (although things aren\u2019t always that simple).\n\nIt\u2019s unclear precisely what Mr Bailey meant in his comment\u2014whether he was drawing a comparison between crime on the two cities\u2019 subway networks, or more generally in the two cities. (Also, he said the crime levels on the London Underground were also \u201creminiscent\u201d of New York\u2019s at their worst, which could be interpreted quite broadly.)\n\nWe\u2019ve asked Mr Bailey about what he was basing his comparison on, and in the meantime we\u2019ve taken a look at the figures to see whether either comparison is fair.\n\nThere was far more crime on the New York City Subway in the early 1990s than on the Tube now\n\nCurrent levels of reported crime on London\u2019s underground are considerably below those in New York in the 1990s.\n\nAt its worst in the 1990s (which was the year 1990) there were 17 reported felonies per million riders on the New York City Subway. Felonies are serious crimes such as violence, robbery and theft, so that number doesn\u2019t include less serious crimes.\n\nBy contrast from November 2017 to September 2018 there were 10 reported incidents per million riders on the London underground (according to figures from the British Transport Police). Unlike the New York felonies data, that includes all incidents\u00ad\u2014serious and less serious.\n\nSo riders of the New York City Subway in 1990 were considerably more likely to experience a serious crime than riders of the London Underground are to experience any crime today.\n\nData including less serious crimes on the New York City Subway is available for 2017. In that year there were 6.7 crime complaints per million riders on the New York City Subway.\n\nLondon is much safer than New York was in the 1990s\n\nThe story above the ground is much the same. Data suggests that New York had a higher crime rate in the early 1990s than London today, but New York\u2019s overall crime rate has since fallen below London\u2019s.\n\nWe haven\u2019t been able to find the total crime rate for New York going back to 1990, but have found data on specific crimes which shows how different the crime levels are.\n\nIn 1990 in New York, 31 homicides and 1,400 robberies per 100,000 people were recorded, compared to 1.5 homicides and 360 robberies per 100,000 in London in 2017.\n\nIn 2017, the police in New York received 5,300 crime complaints per 100,000 residents in 2017, while the Metropolitan Police recorded 9,300 per 100,000 (and that doesn\u2019t include the crimes recorded by the City of London police or the British Transport Police working within London).\n\nOne notable exception is the homicide rate, which in New York in 2017 was three per 100,000 residents, roughly double the rate in London.\n\nOne big health warning is that all these figures are for crimes recorded by the police. This means they don\u2019t account for unreported and unrecorded crimes and so the figures are likely lower than the true crime level in both cities.\n\nHowever that can make comparing crime between the two cities difficult, because it assumes that residents of the two cities were equally likely to report crime, and that the relevant police authorities were equally likely to record those crimes.\n\nAnother issue is that the city-wide crime rates are based on the number of people who live in the cities. But that doesn\u2019t account for people who are in the cities but don\u2019t live there, such as commuters or tourists. So comparisons of crime rates based on resident figures should be taken with a pinch of salt.", "lang": "en"}
