In recent years, numerous public figures have had to apologise for using the term to describe black people, or for defending the character.\n\nThe badge seen in the photo appears to be from UK marmalade and preserve brand Robertson\u2019s. The Golly was the brand\u2019s mascot from 1910 to 2001, when it was \u2018retired\u2019. The brand denied this was in response to a change in popular attitude towards the character.", "lang": "en"}
