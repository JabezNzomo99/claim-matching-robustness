On the Sunday shows, he refused to apologize \u2014 and further asserted that Kelly lists things he did not say. He also argued that he had first been attacked, appearing to refer to Bette Midler and New York Times columnist Gail Collins, two women cited by NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd.\n\nKELLY: Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don\u2019t use a politician\u2019s filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women. You\u2019ve called women you don\u2019t like \u201cfat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.\u201d KELLY: For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O\u2019Donnell. TRUMP: Yes, I\u2019m sure it was. KELLY: Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women\u2019s looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?\n\nWell, Rose O\u2019Donnell did get the Donald treatment for three of those terms. He called her a \u201cbig, fat pig.\u201d He also called her an \u201canimal\u201d and a \u201cslob.\u201d He also called her a \u201chorrible human being, a terrible person\u2026a loser.\u201d He also attacked her as \u201ca bully.\u201d And \u201ca degenerate.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, O\u2019Donnell, while moderating \u201cThe View,\u201d poked fun at Trump for holding a news conference to announce that he would let a Miss USA winner retain her crown, despite allegations of partying and underage drinking. She repeatedly referred to him as \u201cbankrupt,\u201d called him a \u201csnake oil salesman,\u201d and said it was ridiculous he was posing as a \u201cmoral authority\u201d given his history of failed marriages. She also did a wicked imitation of his demeanor, with a faux comb-over.\n\nAs Todd noted, one incident supposedly involved Collins. On Dec. 18, 1992, writing at the time for New York Newsday, Collins wrote a tongue-in-cheek column in which she referred to the \u201cnow-recycled Marla Maples\u201d (Trump\u2019s then-mistress and future wife) and how a deal to build the Riverside South apartment complex would \u201cnot restore Trump to his old billionaire status\u201d but \u201cwill make him a somewhat less financially embattled thousandaire.\u201d The article also mocked his \u201c$300 duck-tail haircut\u201d and quoted an \u201camused city councilman\u201d as asking, \u201cSo is he here strolling for babes?\u201d\n\nNearly two decades later, in 2011, Collins wrote in The New York Times that \u201cduring one down period, I referred to him in print as a \u2018financially embattled thousandaire\u2019 and he sent me a copy of the column with my picture circled and \u2018The Face of a Dog!\u2019 written over it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll have to take Collins\u2019 word for it, as she has not published Trump\u2019s scrawl, but Trump also has used \u201cdog\u201d to refer to other women. For instance, in 2015 he attacked Ariana Huffington as \u201ca dog who wrongfully comments on me.\u201d\n\nTrump should think twice before challenging the research of a major news organization. There is ample evidence for each of the slurs against women uttered or tweeted by Trump. Perhaps he has a point that he attacks once he is provoked, but there is little doubt that the over-the-top language cited by Kelly was correct.", "lang": "en"}
