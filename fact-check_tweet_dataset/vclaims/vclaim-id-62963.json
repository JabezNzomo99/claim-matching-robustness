The photo in the posts is dated and unrelated to his recent arrest.\n\nInformation circulating on social media and online portals suggests that the Head Pastor of the International God\u2019s Way Church, Bishop Daniel Obinim, also known as Angel Obinim, has been released after making bail and was photographed while praying for the very police officials who arrested him. The post shows a picture of Mr Obinim praying for eight kneeling police officers.\n\nOther versions of the story as published by some news and information portals like bbcghana.com, with the headline \u201cPolice Officers Run To Angel Obinim For Prayers Amidst Arrest \u2013 BEGS the angel for forgiveness of SINS\u201d have also been circulated. This particular publication has made it into other portals like operanewsap.com.\n\nDubawa\u2019s Google reverse image search revealed that the picture showing the eight police officers being prayed for by Mr Obinim has been in circulation in the media space since 2019. It cannot, therefore, be connected to the ongoing events of the pastor\u2019s arrest for false publication and forgery in 2020. The specific reason for the purported prayers remains unknown. However, adomfmonline.com reported that the officers were receiving blessings from Obinim at the time of writing their report in 2019.\n\nIt is worth noting that at the time the pictures started circulating on May 20, Mr Obinim was still in Police custody. He was released from custody on Friday, May 23 after meeting bail conditions.\n\nBishop Obinim was still in custody at the time the photos and information popped up. The pictures are first appeared online in 2019 and therefore cannot be related to recent happenings.\n\nRoselena Ahiable is a Senior Researcher with Dubawa Ghana.
