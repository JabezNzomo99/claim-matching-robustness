The posts are misleading; the headline is from a blog post that falsely represents a genuine news publication and the Indonesian information ministry says the quote in the headline has been fabricated.\n\nThe blog article, dated March 27, 2019, was published here on the website k0mpasinf0.blogspot.com \u2013 whose name and logo \u201cKompasInfo\u201d resembles that of Indonesian news organisation Kompas, online here with a different URL at kompas.com.\n\nThe article\u2019s main photo shows Indonesia\u2019s coordinating minister for maritime affairs, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan. Its headline, translated into English, says:\n\n\u201cJokowi administration offers Bogor city to China; Luhut: Hey people, you can\u2019t object and don\u2019t meddle in this issue!\u201d\n\nBogor refers to a major city, and separately also a district, south of the capital Jakarta. Jokowi is the nickname of Indonesia\u2019s President Joko Widodo, who is seeking re-election in April 17 polls. Here is his official Twitter account.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the blog post:\n\nA screenshot of the blog article showing its headline and main picture has been shared hundreds of times in multiple Facebook posts, for example here, here and here, where it has been shared more than 650 times since being published on March 27, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the Facebook posts, whose caption says, when translated, \u201cWho does this country belong to? Think, Grandpa..!!\u201d:\n\nThe blog post falsely represents Kompas \u2013 a national newspaper in publication since 1965, according to this Kompas article. It is owned by the media company Kompas Gramedia, here is its website.\n\nThe URL of the blog is \u201ck0mpasinf0.blogspot.com\u201d. This is clearly different from the Kompas URL: kompas.com.\n\nThe logo in the top left-hand corner of the \u201cKompasInfo\u201d site resembles the logo used on kompas.com.\n\nBelow is an image comparing the two sites\u2019 URLs and logos:\n\nSearching for the blog post\u2019s first paragraph on Google led to this March 27, 2019, news report by Bogor-based local newspaper Radar Bogor.\n\nThe entire text of the Radar Bogor report has been copied into the misleading blog article, but the headline is different.\n\nWhen translated, the original report\u2019s headline states: \u201cJonggol district \u2018sold\u2019 to China; Ade Yasin: I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Jonggol is a subdistrict of Bogor district, and Ade Yasin is the current regional head of Bogor.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Radar Bogor report:\n\nThe first two paragraphs of both the Radar Bogor report and the misleading blog article say:\n\n\u201cThe Indonesian government will offer 28 projects worth US$91.1 billion, which equals to 1,295.8 trillion rupiah, to the government of China at the second high-level Belt and Road Initiative or the Silk Road conference in April.\n\n\u201cOne of the 28 proposed projects would be located in Jonggol subdistrict in Bogor district as the Indonesia-China special economic zone.\u201d\n\nThe coordinating minister for maritime affairs, Luhut Pandjaitan, is Jokowi\u2019s point man in negotiating investment with China. The report about his appointment can be read here.\n\nRadar Bogor did cite the senior minister in its story, but he was not quoted as saying: \u201cHey people, you can\u2019t object and don\u2019t meddle in this issue!\u201d\n\nAccording to the paper, Luhut said the Indonesian government wouldn\u2019t give any special treatment to China and they have to satisfy requirements like other foreign investors.\n\n\u201cFirst, every investor who wants to make an investment has to bring the best technology from the country of origin. We don\u2019t want second-class technology, we want investors bringing technology that is environmentally friendly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Indonesian information ministry also released a statement here on March 28, 2019, saying that Luhut\u2019s quote in the headline of the misleading blog post had been fabricated.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the government\u2019s denial, which includes a screenshot of the \u201cKompasInfo\u201d blog with the word \u201cHOAX\u201d superimposed on it:\n\nThe main photo in the misleading blog post is a stock image of Luhut that has previously been used in news reports by the genuine Indonesian news site Kompas, such as this one, published July 11, 2018, and this one, published August 21, 2018.\n\nThe image below compares a screenshot of the misleading blog post with a screenshot of the July 11, 2018, kompas.com article, showing the photos used are the same:", "lang": "en"}
