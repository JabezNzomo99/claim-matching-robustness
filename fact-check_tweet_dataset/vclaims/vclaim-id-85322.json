All essential services will continue to be functional. The list of essential services, as per the Ministry of Home Affairs, remains unchanged since the March 22 \u2018Janata Curfew\u2019.\n\nSadhvi Deva Thakur, Director at Varanasi-based Deva India Foundation shared (archive link) an image of a mother in a transparent protective suit. In the photo, the mother is holding a baby. Thakur wrote, \u201cDo you have any words? That\u2019s why I say \u201cstay at home\u201d \u2026 this picture truly makes one cry.

According to the caption, \u201cInfant inside Laminar Air Flow Room protection from infection. The child has been irradiated prior to marrow transplant\u201d.\n\n\u201cTotal-body irradiation has continued to play a pivotal role in the conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplant, which has become a common modality in the treatment of both acute and chronic leukaemias and myelodysplastic disorders, as well as relapsed Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas,\u201d as per a report available on Cancer Network by MJH Life Sciences at New Jersey, USA.\n\nThe College of Medicine, University of Florida explains the logic behind total body irradiation.\n\u2022 To suppress the patient\u2019s immune system and prevent rejection of donor bone marrow after a bone marrow transplant using donor marrow (from someone other than the patient).\n\u2022 To kill abnormal cells that escape other therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, or local irradiation and remain hidden in the body to regrow later.\n\nGlinn\u2019s photograph from 1985 shows a baby who has undergone irradiation prior to bone marrow transplant. The woman, probably the mother, is wearing protective gear because the baby\u2019s immune system would be suppressed after the irradiation process and will easily catch the infection.\n\nThus the viral image is not related to coronavirus and the social media claim is false.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India has exceeded 600. This has caused the government to impose a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services. Globally, more than 4 lakh confirmed cases and over 19,000 deaths have been reported. There is a growing sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a global pandemic, can take lives.
