The Daily Mail doesn\u2019t clarify this in its article.\n\nType 2 diabetes is caused by problems with a chemical in the body (hormone) called insulin. It's often linked to being overweight or inactive, or having a family history of type 2 diabetes.\n\nData released to the Daily Mail by NHS Digital shows that in 2018/19 NHS England recorded 1.75 million hospital admissions of patients whose primary or secondary diagnoses was type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe primary diagnosis is the main reason the patient is receiving care in hospital while the secondary diagnoses are relevant \u201cco-morbidities and external causes\u201d.\n\nNHS Digital says: \u201cFor example a patient may be treated for a broken leg, may have diabetes which would be relevant to their care, and may have broken their leg in a traffic accident.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t break down these 1.75 million admissions into patients with diabetes as a primary or secondary diagnosis, but we can look at the number of \u201cconsultant episodes\u201d to show something similar.\n\nWhen you go into hospital your care may be transferred from one consultant to another which would show up as two consultant episodes but just one hospital admission.\n\nIn 2018/19 there were 20.8 million consultant episodes in NHS England hospitals. Of these 2.5 million were for patients with type 2 diabetes. But only 47,000 had type 2 diabetes listed as their primary diagnosis.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that type 2 diabetes plays no role in those 2.45 million other cases where it wasn\u2019t the primary diagnosis, and the data suggests diabetes sufferers are more likely to be in hospital, even if they are not there for diabetes specifically.\n\nProfessor in Diabetes and Endocrinology at the University of Southampton Richard Holt told us: \u201cAdmissions relating to a primary diagnosis of diabetes are relatively uncommon but admissions relating to complications are much higher.\n\n\u201cFor example, diabetes doubles the risk of a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or stroke. In these situations, the diabetes is likely to contribute to the admission even if not a primary diagnosis.\u201d\n\nIn 2018/19, 6.9% of patients at GP practices in England aged 17 and above had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn the same year, type 2 diabetes sufferers made up 13.5% of consultant episodes among people aged 17 and above\u2014almost double the diagnosed rate in the population.\n\nBut this could also be related to the fact that type 2 diabetes affects older people more than younger people, and older people are more likely to go to hospital regardless of whether they have diabetes.\n\nThe average age of someone admitted to hospital in 2018/19 was 54. The average age of someone admitted to hospital who had type 2 diabetes was 71.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s hard to know the extent to which people with type 2 diabetes are in hospital because of their diabetes or because of other health factors related to old age.", "lang": "en"}
