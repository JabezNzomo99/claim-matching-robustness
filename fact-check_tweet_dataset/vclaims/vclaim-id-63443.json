Aftermath of cyclone Amphan, Bengal.\u2019\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found the claim to be false.\n\nOn putting the image through Reverse Image Search, we found the same picture on the India Development and Relief Fund website, dated July 12, 2013.\n\nWe also found the same picture shared on Facebook seven years ago on July 28, 2013.\n\nNewsMobile could not independently verify the origin of the picture.
