Most notably, it pushes the widely debunked theory that the virus was created as a bioweapon in a Chinese lab.\n\nThe post also claims the 1,338-word essay \u2014 which ends \"Wake Up America! WAKE UP!\" \u2014 was written by former Fox News host and political commentator Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\n\"The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity.

No news organizations have reported that he authored such a post.\n\nIt\u2019s not on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s website, where he consistently posts his columns, podcasts and latest media appearances.\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s website staff confirmed that he didn\u2019t write the message.\n\nMeanwhile, fact-checking organization Snopes found that the true author of the screed appears to be a man named Tim Besmer, who posted the same text to his Facebook page on April 2, along with a copyright notice on the bottom with his name and the words \"Permission given for public sharing.\"\n\nAt some point along the way, O\u2019Reilly\u2019s name was added to the essay and Besmer\u2019s disappeared.\n\nThis is a misattributed, unproven conspiracy theory of its own.
