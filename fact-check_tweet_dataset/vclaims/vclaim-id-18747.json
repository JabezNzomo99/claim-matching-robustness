The message accompanying the video says that the woman used to follow Muslim men on Tik Tok and was trapped by seven such people on the app. She was \u201csecular,\u201d says the message.\n\nRecounting the terrifying ordeal, the woman can be heard saying that her husband came home one day when she was asleep and started beating her up. She said that her mother-in-law was also complicit in the crime. Later in the video, a different clip is played where a man records the woman crying. He says that she was made to drink urine, which was also poured on her face and hair. The man justifies the act by saying that women who are promiscuous after marriage deserve such treatment. On Twitter, this portion of the video has been shared by several users, along with a third clip where the woman can be seen getting treated for her injuries.\n\nThe video is massively viral on both Facebook and Twitter with the same claim \u2013 \u201c\u090f\u0915 \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0939\u0924\u0930\u092e\u093e \u0932\u0935 \u091c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0917\u0908\u0964 \u0914\u0930 \u0907\u0928\u0915\u094b \u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092a\u0940\u091f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e \u092a\u0947\u0938\u093e\u092c \u092a\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0917\u0908\u0964 \u092f\u0947 \u0938\u0947\u0915\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0932\u0930 \u0925\u0940\u0964 \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u0925\u0940 \u092f\u0947 \u092c\u0939\u0941\u0924 \u0905\u091b\u0947 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0964tik tok \u092a\u0930 \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0940 \u0925\u0940 fallow \u0935\u0939\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u0907\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u092b\u0901\u0938\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e\u0964 7 \u0932\u0921\u093c\u0915\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947.\u201d\n\nThe video was first posted by Pakistani journalist Iqrar ul Hassan on August 13.
