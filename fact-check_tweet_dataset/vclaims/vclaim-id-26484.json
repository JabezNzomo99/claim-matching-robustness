Two of his best known works, the 1895 satirical play \u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest\u201d and the 1891 philosophical novel \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d are both considered literary classics.\n\nHowever, nowhere in these works, or any of his others, does the phrase about happiness appear. A search of his complete works turned up no matching or similar expressions.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it anywhere in any of Wilde\u2019s published works or his notebooks,\u201d said Sos Eltis, author of \u201cRevising Wilde: Society and Subversion in the Plays of Oscar Wilde,\u201d in an email to the DCNF. \u201cIt looks like someone imitating a familiar oppositional structure that Wilde deployed.\u201d\n\nThe expression, attributed to an anonymous author, appeared below an actual Wilde quote in a 1947 book called \u201cA Little Book of Aphorisms,\u201d according to the website Quote Investigator, though variations of the saying have appeared in print as early as 1908.\n\n\u201cOne important mechanism for generating misattributions is based on the misreading of neighboring quotations,\u201d explains the website. \u201cOne or more inattentive readers of this book may have incorrectly decided that the second statement was crafted by Oscar Wilde.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
