She further quotes her father as saying that \"the Ministry of Health has instructed that the country is going to go on a lockdown for at least a month in the next five days.\"\n\nShe then appeals to the listeners to decide whether \"they want to go to their houses soon\" or stay back wherever they are put, \"as the situation will go worse.\" In the later part of the audio clip, she claims that the lockdown has been announced till April 15 and that the country will come to a standstill during the period. Later, she claims that the information is completely legitimate, as her 'father is in direct contact with the ministry.'\n\nBOOM has chosen not to include the viral clip. The clip has been doing the rounds on Whatsapp with the caption, \"Some girl saying her army officer dad is in contact with the ministry of health who says k Country will go into lockdown within 5 days.\"\n\nThe audio is also viral with another message which appeals people to stock up grocery in the next five days, as 'situation will worsen.' It is not clear who is behind the audio clip.", "lang": "en"}
