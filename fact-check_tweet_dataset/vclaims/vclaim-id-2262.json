It opened:\n\nA set of 54-year-old conjoined twins from Michigan are facing each other in court, as one of the siblings is contesting his brother's right to engage in sexual acts without his consent. Alfred and Wilbert Peterson were born joined at the waist and facing each other, and spent their entire life this way. They have two sets of arms and legs and their own hearts and stomachs but share a lower digestive tract and a penis. This shared penis has become a major source of conflict between the twins over recent years, and Alfred is now going to court to keep his brother from masturbating. \"He keeps playing with our penis without my consent. That's legally a sexual assault!\"\n\nOf course the entire story is made up from a to z. The Siamese twins in the picture are actually Ronnie and Donnie Galyon from Ohio (born in 1951 so well past 54 years old).\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known hoax website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.\n\nSo don't fall for this one either and inform people sharing the article that they are spreading fake news from a satire website.", "lang": "en"}
