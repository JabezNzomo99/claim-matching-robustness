As per a news report, on 25 April 2020, King Salman bin Abdulaziz has ordered partial easing of lockdown restrictions that are being implemented by the Saudi Arabian government. Malls and shopping centers have been allowed to reopen until May 22 (Ramadan 29). But, FACTLY has found the video to be old and not related to any recent incident. The video is found to exist on social media at least since 3 December 2019. FACTLY was unable to find the exact location and the context of the incident in the video. But as the video was found to exist since December 2019, it can be concluded that it is in no way related to the easing of lockdown restrictions in Saudi Arabia.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
