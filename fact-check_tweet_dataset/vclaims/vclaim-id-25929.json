But those cases include more than just complaints of sexual harassment and they don\u2019t only relate to claims against members of Congress.\n\nThe OOC was created to enforce the provisions of the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act \u2014 which, in addition to congressional offices, applies to Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office and other legislative agencies. In a fact-sheet last year, the OOC said that \u201ca large portion of cases before the OOC come from employing offices in the legislative branch other than the House of Representatives or the Senate.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
