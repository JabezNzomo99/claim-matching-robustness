Barr also said in a statement that \u201cThe violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\u201d\n\nBut the United States currently does not have a process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations, which makes Trump\u2019s ability to enforce such a designation highly unlikely.\n\nAntifa, short for anti-fascist, is an amorphous movement of people who are opposed to fascism. They do not comprise an organized group, do not have a visible leadership, and acknowledge that they are secretive, so it is impossible to know how many people even count themselves as members. Anti-fascists lean strongly toward the left of the political spectrum, and many of them refer to themselves as socialists, anarchists, communists, or anti-capitalists. The positions of various antifa groups can also be difficult to define, but many of them support oppressed community members and protest against amassing of wealth by corporations.\n\nSome antifa movements date their origins to the battle against European fascism in the 1920s and \u201930s. The BBC cited Mark Bray, the author of \u201cAntifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\u201d as an authority in noting that \u201c[Bray] says the modern American Antifa movement began in the 1980s with a group called Anti-Racist Action. Its members confronted neo-Nazi skinheads at punk gigs in the American Midwest and elsewhere. By the early 2000s the Antifa movement was mostly dormant \u2014 until the rise of Donald Trump and the alt-right.\u201d\n\nAntifa groups are not monolithic and employ a range of tactics. Many condemn the use of violence, but according to BBC News, some groups engage in aggressive confrontations, especially with far-right groups on the streets. Extreme factions have carried pepper spray, bricks, knives, and chains with them.\n\nTrump claimed members of the movement were responsible for acts of vandalism during the May and June 2020 protests against police brutality in the U.S., but in at least one case a white supremacist group was found to have posed as antifa on Twitter. Groups associated with both right and left, not just antifa, are being accused of inciting violence and looting during the protests. In most cases it is difficult to ascertain that antifa is solely responsible for the lawless activities occurring at some protests, and the culprits are still being investigated, as Keith Ellison, Minnesota\u2019s attorney general, observed on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d:\n\nWithout any official structure to the group, or much evidence linking antifa to specific acts of violence, it would be difficult to prove that that body of activists is behind anything, Faiza Patel, director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security program, said: \u201cAs far as we know, antifa doesn\u2019t have bank accounts or assets or infrastructure \u2026 Also there haven\u2019t been any deaths attributed to anti-fascist violence, and one of the hallmarks of foreign terrorist organizations \u2014 a designation the U.S. government does make \u2014 is the acknowledgement of attacks that involve many fatalities.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ability to designate anti-fascists as a terrorist group is also highly suspect given that only foreign groups can be labeled as \u201cterrorist\u201d organizations under U.S. law, and \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d is not currently a federal crime in the U.S., according to the New York Times:\n\nA 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) on domestic terrorism similarly stated that:\n\nThe CRS report also noted that although the U.S. does not officially designate domestic terror organizations, it does record individual terrorists and threats in its Terrorist Screening Database:\n\nIn an interview with Snopes, Patel said that a number of different crimes can be designated as acts of terrorism:\n\nThere is no single crime of either domestic or international terrorism. But both types of terrorism can be prosecuted under a number of statutes which constitute crimes of terrorism. The crime of hijacking an airplane, for example, is an act of terrorism. In fact, the government has available 51 different criminal statutes which can be applied domestic terrorism. It does not \u2013 and should not \u2013 have the ability to designate a domestic organization. This would allow the government to target political activity as terrorism, which is exactly what the White House and the Justice Department are trying to do by threatening to go after protestors under the guise of targeting Antifa.\n\nThe State Department makes a list of designated \u201cForeign Terrorist Organizations\u201d (FTO) available on their website. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), enforcing the terrorist designation for FTOs involves blocking assets, prosecuting individuals, and imposing immigration restrictions on FTOs, their members, and their supporters.\n\nPatel added that the Secretary of State can designate foreign terrorist groups, but this triggers a range of consequences: \u201cmost important of which is the ability to prosecute anyone who provides the group with material support, no matter how minimal. In addition property and assets of persons linked to terrorism can be blocked, but only under a law that requires a connection to a mainly foreign threat.\u201d\n\nThus, as a large, decentralized entity with no infrastructure or assets that we know of, designating and targeting antifa as a domestic terrorist organization could, according to some experts, create a dangerous scenario, as Patel told us:\n\nThe paucity of evidence directly connecting antifa to acts violence during protests, combined with the structureless nature of the group and the fact that the U.S. currently has no legal process for designating domestic terrorist organizations, leads us to rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
