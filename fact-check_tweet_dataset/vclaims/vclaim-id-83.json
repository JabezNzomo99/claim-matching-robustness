Some posts hint at a conspiracy of previous knowledge about the possibility of a pandemic occurring on the same year as the film\u2019s release.\n\nThe posts are accompanied by a dramatic trailer about the spread of a flu-like pandemic that sows chaos globally as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention struggles to find a cure.\n\nThese claims are inaccurate. The trailer that accompanies the posts is not for an upcoming release but of \u201cContagion\u201d, a film released on September 9, 2011 and directed by Steven Soderbergh ( www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/ ).\n\nThe film\u2019s brief description on IMDB says: \u201cHealthcare professionals, government officials and everyday people find themselves in the midst of a pandemic as the CDC works to find a cure.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported the recent coronavirus outbreak has prompted a resurgence of this film\u2019s popularity ( here ).\n\nAccording to the Times, Scott Z. Burns, the movie\u2019s screenwriter, \u201cconducted months of in-depth research into the science of pandemics\u201d and recruited several well-known epidemiologists to develop a realistic plot\u201d. Perhaps for this reason, the outbreak of coronavirus has elicited comparisons to the film, including by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow who played the protagonist in the 2011 film ( here ).\n\nFalse: Trailer promotes film \u201cContagion\u201d, a 2011 film on the outbreak of a fictional pandemic, not an upcoming release\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
