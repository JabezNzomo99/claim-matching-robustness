We\u2019re not touching that here. Instead, we turn to another ownership claim by Brady.\n\n \n\n In last week\u2019s televised mayoral debate, she was introduced as board chair and co-owner of Celilo Group Media. The company publishes and distributes coupon books, including the popular Chinook Book.\n\n \n\n Company president Nik Blosser said that he doesn\u2019t use the co-owner term. But he confirmed that Brady is the third largest individual who is a shareholder in the company. He and co-founder Tom Koehler invited Brady to join their board nearly a decade ago, and she has been chairwoman since.\n\n \n\n \"So she has and has had a key leadership role in the company, and she's an investor herself,\" Blosser said.\n\n \n\n Who are we to argue with that? Brady\u2019s claim is accurate. We rule the statement True.", "lang": "en"}
