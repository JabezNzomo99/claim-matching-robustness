Kamala Harris\u2019 birth certificate identifies her race as \u201cCaucasian.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cCaucasian\u201d appears in the \u201ccolor or race of the mother\u201d section of the pictured birth certificate. There does not appear to be a field on the document specifying Harris\u2019 race.\n\nSocial media users have been sharing false rumors targeting Harris since Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden announced her as his running mate on Aug. 11. This particular Facebook post attempts to question Harris\u2019 racial background.\n\nFeatured in the post is a screen grab of a tweet that purports to show a copy of Harris\u2019 birth certificate. The pictured document, though blurry, seems to have the word \u201cCaucasian\u201d circled. It appears to closely resemble a copy of her birth certificate obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation from the Alameda County Clerk-Recorder\u2019s Office.\n\nThe text in the tweet reads, \u201cSen K Harris listed as Caucasian on her birth certificate\u2026by her parents.\u201d (RELATED: Kamala Harris Says She Never Jailed Anybody For Truancy)\n\nHowever, a close look at the pictured document reveals the word \u201cCaucasian\u201d falls under the section \u201cColor or Race of Mother.\u201d A few lines below that, the section \u201cColor or Race of Father\u201d lists \u201cJamaican.\u201d The fields appear to match those on the copy of the birth certificate obtained by the DCNF.\n\nHarris\u2019 late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, immigrated to the U.S. from India. Gopalan, a Tamil Indian-American, earned a PhD in nutrition and endocrinology from the University of California, Berkeley, according to Reuters. Her father, Donald Harris, relocated from Jamaica and later became a Stanford economics professor, Check Your Fact previously reported.\n\nThe document does not appear to specify Harris\u2019 race, contrary to the Facebook post\u2019s claim. Harris identifies as \u201cthe second African-American woman and first South Asian-American senator in history\u201d on her Senate website.\n\nHarris\u2019 office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
