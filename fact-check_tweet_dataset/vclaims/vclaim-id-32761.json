The quotes go on to say that vaccine-makers will make \u201cbillions\u201d from \u201cproviding extermination services\u201d.\n\nIt can be hard to prove that a person never said something, because of course not every word is recorded and searchable. However, the evidence in this case clearly shows that the quote was invented.\n\nSeveral attempts by other fact checkers have failed to any evidence of Dr Kissinger speaking or writing these words, or anything similar. The World Health Organisation told both Politifact and Africa Check that it has no record of this speech. And the \u201cCouncil on Eugenics\u201d doesn\u2019t even exist.\n\nThe anonymous Facebook post gives no other source for the quote.", "lang": "en"}
