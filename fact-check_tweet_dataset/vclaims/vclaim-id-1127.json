Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. The other presidents are pictured in front of U.S. flags, while Obama is in front of yellow drapery labelled a \u201cMuslim prayer curtain\u201d. There is no such thing as a \u201cMuslim prayer curtain\u201d, and the implication that Obama did not want to stand in front of U.S. flags during his presidency, or that he may have replaced U.S. flags with a \u201cMuslim prayer curtain\u201d, is untrue.\n\nOne example of the claim from 2015 nearing half a million shares is visible here . Recent examples of the post being shared can be seen here , here , and here .\n\nMany observant Muslims enjoin five times daily in salat, a ritual prayer ( www.britannica.com/topic/salat ). To cover the bare ground or floor while they pray, many Muslims use a prayer rug, or sajjada, which is often decorated with religious symbols ( here ). There is no such thing as a \u201cMuslim prayer curtain\u201d. In the post, the gold-colored curtain behind Obama shows no markings, Arabic text or religious symbols.\n\nSimilar drapery was seen in the Oval Office before the Obama administration, ( here ) and has been visible throughout the Trump administration ( here ; here ).\n\nObama has also been pictured standing in front of U.S. flags and the gold-colored curtains in the East Room of the White House ( here ). Other examples of the former President standing in front of U.S. flags are visible reut.rs/2Nq63Ns and reut.rs/3eBHskW .\n\nThe gold curtains have been in the White House for decades ( here ).\n\nFalse. Obama did not replace American flags in the White House with a \u201cMuslim prayer curtain\u201d. The golden drapery has been in the White House for decades.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
