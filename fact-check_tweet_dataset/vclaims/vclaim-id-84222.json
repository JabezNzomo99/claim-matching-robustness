The claims are false; accommodation to allow for religious observance by people of all creeds is required under the Ontario Human Rights Code, but there is no requirement for public schools to provide a mosque.\n\nOne version of the Facebook post, archived here, states that Renu Mandhane, Chief Commissioner of the OHRC, said it is \u201cmandatory to provide a mosque in public schools if a Muslim student demands that facility.\u201d Another version, archived here, claims Mandhane has notified public school boards across Ontario that they \u201cmust provide\u201d an Islamic prayer room.\n\nAccording to CrowdTangle, a social media monitoring tool, the post pictured on the left was shared in March 2019, but has since been removed from this Canadian yellow vest Facebook group. The version of the post on the right can also be found on Facebook here, shared to a group for supporters of Canadian opposition politician Maxime Bernier.\n\nThere is no evidence on the OHRC website or on Mandhane\u2019s official Twitter account that she has sent the notifications described in the false posts.\n\nYves Massicotte, Information Officer at the OHRC, told AFP by email, \u201cNeither the OHRC nor the Chief Commissioner have ever said or \u2018notified school boards across Ontario that is now mandatory to provide a mosque in public schools.\u2019 There is no such mandatory requirement.\u201d\n\nThis is the OHRC\u2019s policy statement explaining the duty of schools to accommodate students\u2019 religious practice.\n\n\u201cThe Ontario Human Rights Code requires that schools consider individual requests for religious accommodation and provide accommodation, which could include some time and space for an individual to pray, unless it would cause undue hardship,\u201d Massicotte told AFP.\n\nWhen assessing hardship, the policy statement says that schools should consider three factors:\n\u2022 Outside funding, if any\n\u2022 Health and safety requirements, if any\n\nThe OHCR gives the following examples of how a school might accommodate observance:\n\nMassicotte also emphasized that the OHRC requires that schools \u201cmaintain an environment that is free of pressure or compulsion in matters of religion and belief.\u201d\n\nHeather Irwin, senior media relations coordinator for the Ontario Ministry of Education, told AFP by email: \u201cAll publicly funded school boards must comply with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Ontario Human Rights Code and the Education Act and their respective regulations.\u201d\n\nEach school board must have religious accommodation guidelines in place, according to Irwin.\n\nCarla Pereira, Director of Communications for the Peel District School Board, which oversees 257 schools in Brampton, Caledon and Mississauga, Ontario told AFP by email, \u201cNone of our schools operate mosques inside of them.\u201d\n\nPereira sent AFP a copy of the district\u2019s religious accomodations procedure. It states: \u201cStudents and staff of any faith background can request religious accommodation. Accommodation will be provided on a case by case basis.\u201d\n\nShe said that if Muslim students request to gather for Friday prayers the typical accommodation would be to allow them to gather in the cafeteria or a classroom.\n\nThis is a link to the guidelines for religious accommodation issued by the Toronto School District Board, which oversees 582 schools. It states: \u201cThe Board continues to follow the legal requirement that religious exercises and indoctrination shall not occur in its schools. However, there are requests for religious accommodation that can be accommodated. For example, students are not required to attend school on a religious holy day.\u201d\n\nThe policy goes on to detail an example of a specific accommodation at the Valley Park Middle School where, at the request of the predominantly Muslim community, the school provides \u201cunused space for prayer.\u201d\n\nAccording to the OHRC website, Mandhane was appointed Chief Commissioner in October 2015, not recently as one of the posts falsely claims. This is the government\u2019s press release on her appointment.\n\nThis 2015 profile story from The Star newspaper states that Mandhane was born in Calgary, Canada. This is Mandhane\u2019s official OHRC biography.\n\nThis website explains that OHCR commissioners are appointed by the Ontario Lieutenant Governor, who in 2015 was Madeleine Meilleur. Neither Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nor Ontario Premier Doug Ford played a role in Mandhane\u2019s appointment.\n\nWhat can be concluded?\n\nStaff members and students of all creeds can make requests for religious accommodation from public school boards in Ontario, but there is no single policy for all Ontario schools and public school boards have no obligation to provide a mosque.\n\nAccording to the Ontario Ministry of Education\u2019s Irwin, \u201cDistrict school boards and schools work with their communities in making appropriate accommodations that are sensitive to the religious beliefs and practices of their students and staff. Boards have the autonomy and flexibility to make accommodations on a case by case basis, based on individual requests.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
