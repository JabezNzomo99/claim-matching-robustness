It\u2019s the handiwork of mischief makers\u201c, his response simply read.\n\nMr Emefiele was appointed as CBN Governor on June 3, 2014, and his five-year tenure expires in some months \u2013 June 2019; except he is reappointed by the President for another tenure in office subject to ratification by the National Assembly as provided by law.\n\nSection 10 of the CBN Act of 2007 says \u201cthe Governor and Deputy Governors shall be appointed in the first instance for a term of five years and shall each be eligible for re-appointment for another term not exceeding five years\u201d.\n\nOn the removal of the governor, section 8 the CBN Act of 2007 provides that: \u201cthe removal of the governor shall be supported by two-thirds majority of the Senate praying that he be so removed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate is presently on recess and it will be an aberration for the President to do so without approval of the Senate!\n\nCONCLUSION: Considering the response from the CBN spokesman and the provision of the law, it is FALSE that President Buhari sacked the CBN governor.", "lang": "en"}
