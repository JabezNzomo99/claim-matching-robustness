This is false; Lebanese authorities have pointed to a huge cache of ammonium nitrate stored at the port, and experts say there is no evidence that it was a nuclear explosion.\n\n\u201cBreaking: Israel nukes Beirut,\u201d says an image in an August 4, 2020 Facebook post.\n\nThe image appears to be a screenshot of a headline from the \u201cVeterans Today\u201d website, which advertises itself as \u201cServing the Clandestine Community.\u201d\n\nOther claims that the Beirut blast was nuclear appear on Facebook here, here and here, Instagram here and here, and Twitter here.\n\nThe August 4 explosion at Beirut\u2019s port was devastating, killing more than 150 people and leaving thousands wounded. But it was not nuclear.\n\nLebanon\u2019s Prime Minister Hassan Diab said 2,750 tons of the agricultural fertilizer ammonium nitrate that had been stored for years in a portside warehouse exploded, sparking \u201ca disaster in every sense of the word.\u201d\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on August 5 that the explosion may have been an accident, after earlier claiming US generals had told him it appeared to have been caused by a \u201cbomb of some kind.\u201d\n\nAnd US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that \u201cmost believe that it was an accident as reported.\u201d\n\nLebanon\u2019s President Michel Aoun said on August 7 that the explosion was due to \u201ceither negligence or foreign interference through a missile or bomb,\u201d though he made no mention of a possible nuclear blast.\n\nSome posts claim that \u201cJeff Smith of the IAEA confirms this is a nuclear explosion.\u201d A person by that name has also been tied to unsubstantiated claims of a possible nuclear blast in Yemen.\n\nBut International Atomic Energy Agency spokesman Fredrik Dahl told AFP by email: \u201cThe IAEA has made no such statements.\u201d\n\nExperts meanwhile said evidence does not indicate that the Beirut explosion was nuclear.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look anything like a nuclear explosion,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, told AFP by phone.\n\n\u201cIf this were a nuclear explosion, there would have been a bright flash of light, which there wasn\u2019t,\u201d and \u201cgenerally speaking, nuclear explosions are much, much, much larger than this,\u201d he said.\n\nLewis also noted that the reddish-brown color of the cloud that rose over Beirut following the blast is \u201cvery typical of ammonium nitrate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about it that looked nuclear, and a lot of things about it that looked like an ammonium nitrate explosion.\u201d\n\nVipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at MIT who specializes in nuclear weapons and proliferation, agreed.\n\n\u201cIt was an intense blast, and it is a tragedy for the people of Beirut. But it was not nuclear,\u201d Narang told AFP by email.\n\nThere was \u201cno double flash. The double flash is the characteristically unique feature of a nuclear detonation: an intense flash of light which dims as the shockwave obscures the fireball, but then brightens as the shockwave dissipates,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditionally, \u201cnuclear mushroom clouds are not red,\u201d as was the cloud in Beirut.\n\nThe explosion comes during the collapse of Lebanon\u2019s economy -- yet another problem with which the crisis-hit country now has to contend.", "lang": "en"}
