Our Muslim brothers and sisters are being tortured in Kashmir.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. The picture is from Venezuela where close to 50 inmates were shot dead by security forces after a riot broke out inside a prison last month.\n\nThe misleading post is being widely shared on social media. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nUsing Yandex reverse search, we found that the viral picture was used in an article by Venezuelan news website \u201cQue Pasa\u201d on May 7, 2020. The report said more than 40 people were killed after clashes broke out between prisoners and police at a jail in Guanare city of Venezuela. Some security officials were also injured in the clashes.\n\nThe death toll later went up to 47, while more than 60 people were injured, mostly with gunshot wounds. News website \u201cPanAm Post\u201d also used a similar picture of the incident with the same information. The incident took place on May 1.\n\nCiting local media, another news website \u201cEn Son Haber\u201d said the prisoners were killed when they attempted to escape during the clashes.\n\nSeveral international media organisations had also covered the incident. As per \u201cThe Guardian\u201d, the clashes at the prison started with an inmate demanding that relatives be allowed to deliver him food.\n\nHence, it can be concluded that the viral post is misleading and the picture is not from India but Venezuela.", "lang": "en"}
