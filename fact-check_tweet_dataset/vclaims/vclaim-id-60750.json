Scott Walker -- and his allies -- began emphasizing an obscure measurement to argue that his policies were improving the state\u2019s economy: an index created by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\nIt sounds like a prestigious, important metric. But until Walker started discussing the Philly Fed report, scant attention was paid to this index of states\u2019 economies. The report is meant to predict how the states\u2019 economies will grow in the next six months, but is seldom cited nationally and almost never used to compare one state with another. More on that last point later.\n\nBut after issued Sept. 24, 2013, the Philly Fed became a talking point for Walker and his supporters, including the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, which featured it in a $1 million .\n\nFor his part, Walker\u2019s office highlighted the Sept. 24, 2013 report in public appearances, social media, and with . The headline: \"Wisconsin ranked #2 in economic growth.\"\n\nAmid concern about jobs, is Wisconsin really ranked second for economic growth?\n\nAs we looked into Walker\u2019s claim, we learned that there\u2019s good reason the report doesn\u2019t receive much attention: The index varies wildly from month to month. In late spring, the index ranked Wisconsin\u2019s economy as second worst in the nation, behind only Wyoming.\n\nHow did we go from bottom of the barrel to the cream of the crop?\n\nThe seeks to measure state-by-state economic growth using variables such as building permits, initial unemployment insurance claims and data from a survey of manufacturers.\n\nA key component is each state\u2019s monthly jobs report. This figure is based on reports from only about 3 percent of the state\u2019s employers. It comes with a large margin of error, is revised in subsequent months, and ultimately replaced with more-accurate quarterly figures that come from virtually all state employers.\n\nThe preliminary Philly Fed report for April 2013 showed only five states with contraction , assigning Wisconsin an index rank of -0.74 percent. Wyoming, with a rank of -1.29 percent, was the only state with a lower index.\n\nThings changed in the report issued one month later. The state\u2019s April ranking was revised to 40th. And the new report, for May, said Wisconsin had moved up to 20th place.\n\nThis volatility is identical to that seen in the monthly jobs reports. Walker\u2019s own administration once highlighted those jobs reports as a measure of success, but now criticizes them as inaccurate. Yet the same data is used to create the Philly Fed index.\n\nThe Philly Fed doesn\u2019t provide a first-to-worst listing for the states, but it is easily created by ranking states by the percentage change in the states\u2019 indexes from month to month.\n\nThat is what Walker did in September, when he declared the August numbers showed Wisconsin ranked second. The index for Wisconsin grew 0.51 percent from July to August. The only other state that had a larger change was North Dakota, which increased 0.52 percent.\n\nNationally, the index changed 0.23 percent in the same time frame.\n\nTo be clear, the Philly Fed doesn\u2019t do the ranking. The bank provides the monthly index and States are grouped into seven categories based on the size of the change. It\u2019s a simple process to calculate the percentage change, and then sort them from highest to lowest.\n\nAfter Walker touted the number, the Philly Fed issued a statement saying that it was wrong to use its data to compare performance between states: \"We do not consider state rankings based on the coincident and leading indexes to be valid.\"\n\nWhen we asked the governor\u2019s office about this, they said such state-to-state comparisons were valid, and cited an unusual source: The Philly Fed itself.\n\nWalker\u2019s staff pointed us to the that explains the indexes. it reads: \"The model and the input variables are consistent across the 50 states, so the state indexes are comparable to one another.\"\n\nWhen we went back to the bank, spokeswoman Marilyn Wimp said they were sticking with their most recent statement -- don\u2019t compare states -- despite what the website says.\n\nAnd bank spokesman Thomas Elliott directed us to a January 2013 report issued by the bank that evaluates the effectiveness of the index. That report says the index provides a good measure of states\u2019 economies but that state-by-state comparisons are problematic because the system doesn\u2019t provide good measurements for states that have a lot of agriculture or mining.\n\nHere is the relevant portion: \"Since the volatility of the percent change in these indexes is relatively large compared to the average change, an individual state\u2019s ranking based on the percent change can jump wildly from one end of a relatively narrow range to the other. Rank order is not persistent, thus state rankings are misleading.\"\n\nWe asked Elliott if the bank has told Walker not to make state-to-state comparisons.\n\n\"We were proactive in reaching out to those who mischaracterized our indexes,\" he responded.\n\nWalker said the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank ranks Wisconsin as \"No. 2 in economic growth.\"\n\nBut the bank did not provide the information as a ranking and maintains it is not valid to make such state-to-state comparisons. What\u2019s more, the number for each state is based in part on monthly employment numbers which Walker\u2019s own administration has criticized as inaccurate.\n\nStill, the fact the bank\u2019s own website seems to invite a comparison.", "lang": "en"}
