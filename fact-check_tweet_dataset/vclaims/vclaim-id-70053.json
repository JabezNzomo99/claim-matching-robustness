A spokesperson for the Kenosha Sheriff\u2019s Office said the alleged shooter\u2019s father does not and has never worked for the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nThe city of Kenosha has experienced unrest following the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police. During the third night of riots, Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Illinois, allegedly shot three people, killing two, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nA viral post alleges Kyle Rittenhouse\u2019s father serves as a deputy for the Kenosha Sheriff\u2019s Office, saying, \u201cWondering about Kyle Rittenhouse\u2019s father? Call the Kenosha Sheriff\u2019s Dept and ask Deputy Rittenhouse.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Jacob Blake Sexually Assaulted A 14-Year-Old)\n\nWhile little information about Kyle Rittenhouse\u2019s father is available online, there is no indication he works for the Kenosha Sheriff\u2019s Office. No one with the last name Rittenhouse appears on the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s staff list online. Searching the county\u2019s staff directory also didn\u2019t turn up any matches for the surname.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to both the Kenosha Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Kenosha Police Department. A spokesperson for the Kenosha Sheriff\u2019s Office confirmed to the DCNF in a phone call that the alleged shooter\u2019s father does not and has never worked in the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cIf he was an employee of the City of Kenosha, in any capacity, I am certain I would know about it,\u201d Lt. Joseph Nosalik, a public information officer for the Kenosha Police Department, said in an email to the DCNF. \u201cI do not have any information that would confirm that rumor.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Kyle Rittenhouse lives with his single mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, in Antioch, a village located just south of the Wisconsin border. His now-deleted Facebook page showed support for the Blue Lives Matter movement, and he was a former public safety cadet, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWendy Rittenhouse took one Michael Rittenhouse to court for child support in 2014, Lake County court records show. A copy of the complaint filed in relation to the case that the DCNF obtained describes the man as the \u201cresponsible relative\u201d obligated to support Kyle Rittenhouse \u201cby virtue of a presumption arising from marriage.\u201d The date of birth listed for Kyle Rittenhouse in the child support complaint matches that in the criminal complaint against the 17-year-old.\n\nKyle Rittenhouse has been charged with two counts of first-degree homicide and one count of attempted homicide, among other charges, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
