He told Africa Check that their data was from the 2016 survey by the national statistics office. But the majority of small businesses are not officially listed, he said.\n\n\u201cYou'd only be able to fact check the figure if they were all on a national business register, but the truth is \u2026 most of them are not,\u201d Shah said.\n\nThe state agency responsible for small businesses, the\n\n, told Africa Check that it relies on data from the\n\n. This, it said, was the \u201cfirst comprehensive study\u201d on small businesses in Kenya, succeeding the narrower\n\n. It confirmed to Africa Check that the survey was also aimed at getting more data on informal businesses.\n\nThe 2016 survey adopted Kenya\u2019s official definition of MSMEs as businesses that have fewer than 100 employees. These include working owners, full-time paid employees, unpaid family workers, part-time workers and apprentices.\n\nThey were further classified as follows:\n\u2022 None Micro enterprises \u2013 those with 1 to 9 employees \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey added that the current law on small businesses, the\n\n, further defines micro enterprises as those with an annual turnover of less than KSh500,000. Small enterprises have a turnover of between KSh500,000 and KSh5 million. The law does not give an upper threshold for medium-sized businesses.\n\nHow many small businesses are there in Kenya?\n\nThe 2016 survey estimated that there were about 1.56 million MSMEs licensed by the 47 county governments, and 5.85 million unlicensed businesses, making for a total of 7.41 million micro, small and medium businesses.\n\nTo estimate this, the statistics office sampled 50,043 licensed businesses from March to June 2016. An additional 14,000 households were targeted so as to capture household-based enterprises, which it said were largely unlicensed.\n\nBut the data agency doesn\u2019t have a publication with the number of\n\n, its director of macroeconomic statistics, told Africa Check. It is therefore difficult to establish what share of the total number of businesses 7.41 million MSMEs constitutes.\n\nFor these to constitute 80%, as Kenyatta claimed, Kenya would have 9.26 million businesses in total. We haven\u2019t yet found any data that shows this.\n\nIn its 2016 survey, the statistics office called for \u201ca comprehensive scientific MSME inventory\u201d, to be updated every year.\n\naimed at collecting data on the number of small businesses, especially those that are not listed and\n\nBut a spokesperson for the Kenya Revenue Authority, Paul Agonda, told Africa Check the agency did not have \u201crecent data\u201d on small businesses, and referred us back to the statistics bureau and the chamber of commerce.\n\n, published in 2018 by the national statistics office, estimated that smaller businesses employed 14.9 million people.\n\nThe statistics agency told Africa Check that although data was collected in 2016, it was based on activities in 2015. It estimated that the number of jobs in the country was\n\nin 2015, meaning that MSMEs would have accounted for 98% of all jobs in the country.\n\nOfficial data on employment in the Kenyan economy during this period was in the\n\n. It sampled 23,852 households across each of the country\u2019s 47 counties, from September 2015 to August 2016, with 21,734 (91.3%) households successfully interviewed.\n\nIt found that 17.9 million Kenyans had jobs, while another 1.4 million were classified as unemployed but\n\nThe labour force report released in March 2018 remains the most recent on jobs in Kenya, with the previous labour survey published in 2009. In June 2018 statistics bureau director-general Zachary Mwangi\n\nthat the agency planned to conduct \u201cannual and quarterly\u201d surveys.\n\nThe first annual labour force survey would be released in July 2019, Mwangi said. In the event, comparable data for 2015, the year the most recent small business survey covers, is unavailable, again making it difficult to work out their contribution to the country\u2019s jobs.\n\nin Nairobi. He said the inconsistent data collection on small businesses was a challenge for statistics.\n\n\u201cWe know the nationally representative data was from 2015, and the data before that was published in 1999. But where is the Kenya Revenue Authority\u2019s record? What is the national chamber [of commerce] doing with the information they have?\u201d\n\n\u201cInformation in the counties is very difficult to get. There are information technology issues and some of the systems are manual or semi-automated \u2026 [and] do not necessarily create output you can use,\u201d Obebo said.\n\nHe highlighted data sharing gaps and said that more interaction between organs of government could help statisticians \u201ctriangulate\u201d.\n\nThis claim further adds to the data challenge.\n\nMicro, small and medium sized businesses contributed 33.8% of Kenya\u2019s GDP in 2015, the\n\nby the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics found.\n\nThis would mean they would have contributed about KSh2.13 trillion of the the GDP, which for 2015 was\n\nBut the small businesses survey gave the contribution of small businesses as KSh1.7 trillion, which it said was the\n\nin 2015 against a national total of\n\nwith 2015 as the reference year,\n\nthe MSME survey remains the most recent nationally representative data on the sector. It estimated that there were 7.41 million small businesses in total.\n\nBut Kenyatta said this was the figure \u201ccurrently\u201d. Kenya\u2019s most recent GDP\n\nto be KSh8.9 trillion in 2018. One would need to compare the 2018 contribution of MSMEs against this figure, not the estimate from 2015. Without Kenyatta\u2019s office clarifying his evidence, we can also only rate this claim unproven.\n\nThe lack of comparable and reliable data is a real concern in working out the significance of such an important sector of Kenya\u2019s economy.", "lang": "en"}
