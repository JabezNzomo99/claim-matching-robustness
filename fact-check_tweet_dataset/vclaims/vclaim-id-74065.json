The disease is primarily contracted through drinking contaminated water or breathing in contaminated water droplets.\n\nSince the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended in early April that people wear face coverings in public settings, misinformation about face masks has circulated on social media.\n\nThis particular post falsely claims wearing a mask \u201cevery day all day long\u201d causes people to contract Legionnaires\u2019 disease, a severe form of pneumonia caused by inhaling Legionella bacteria. More than 4,000 users had shared the post at the time of publication.\n\nThere is no scientific basis for the claim, according to medical experts. Legionella.org, a nonprofit organization that raises awareness about the disease, states Legionnaires\u2019 disease comes from inhaling water droplets containing Legionella bacteria, not from wearing face masks.

Your mask would not be a source of transmission for the Legionella bacteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way that the environment that would be produced from a damp mask is going to be suitable for Legionella to grow in any kind of quality to cause Legionnaires\u2019 disease,\u201d Dr. Jonathan Parsons, a pulmonologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe bacterium that causes Legionnaires\u2019 disease primarily spreads through the inhalation of mist from infected water sources like air-conditioning cooling towers and hot tubs, according to the CDC. The disease can also be caused by aspirating infected water while drinking.\n\n\u201cMany studies and case reports regarding legionnaires have been published over the years,\u201d Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, told Reuters. \u201cI am not aware of any that say that mask wearing is a risk factor for developing the disease.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the use of face masks has been erroneously linked to a medical malady. Check Your Fact recently debunked the claim that wearing one for eight or more hours can cause pleurisy, a condition in which the tissue layers lining the lungs become inflamed.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
