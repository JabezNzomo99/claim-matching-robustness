No, that's not true: pranksters are spreading this rumor but all it will do is shut you out of your Twitter account for being under 13 years old which is against Twitter's Terms of Service.\n\nAn example of the claim can be seen in a tweet published on March 27, 2019 by \"Taha \u2744\ufe0f\" on Twitter (archived here):\n\nThe tweet came with a forged image showing the supposed color change:\n\nHowever the claim is false. Twitter Support already responded with an official tweet:\n\nThey also mention it is possible to get your account activated again but it will take some work as you will need to prove your real age to Twitter:\n\nSeveral Twitter users apparently fell for the prank:\n\nDon't be one of those people!", "lang": "en"}
