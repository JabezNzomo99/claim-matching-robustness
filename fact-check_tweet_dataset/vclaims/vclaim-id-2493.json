And is it true that taxpayers have to foot the entire bill, even when the president isn\u2019t traveling on official business?\n\nThe first question to consider is how much the use of Air Force One really costs U.S. taxpayers. The \u201c$200,000 per hour\u201d cost of Air Force One (or, more specifically, of the Boeing VC-25A aircraft on which the President usually travels) is a commonly cited figure, but it is both variable and highly misleading. For starters, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF) reported in April 2016 that the cost per flight hour (CPFH) for Air Force One had decreased in the last few years:\n\nThe main issue with this dollar figure is that it\u2019s not very informative since we don\u2019t know how much Air Force One costs when the President isn\u2019t using it. That is, cost per flight hour (CPFH) is typically determined by dividing fixed costs (or operating and support costs) by the number of hours flown \u2014 so an airplane that is very expensive to maintain but is flown relatively little (as Air Force One is) will have a high CPFH, but most of those costs will be incurred whether the aircraft is used or not.\n\nAs a ridiculously simplistic example, let\u2019s suppose you own a small plane that you pay $10,000 per month (or $120,000 per year) to maintain and store in a hangar, and once per year you put $1,000 worth of fuel in that plane and fly it for an hour. Your CPFH for the year would be a whopping $121,000, even though you would have spent $120,000 of that had you never used the plane at all. Moreover, if you bought $10,000 worth of fuel and flew the plane for ten hours, your CPFH would drop all the way to $13,000 even though you actually spent more money on your airplane.\n\nAir Force One likely has a very high fixed cost because it has to be continuously maintained, inspected, secured, crewed, and prepped to fly at a moment\u2019s notice, but since it doesn\u2019t generally log a lot of flight hours (especially when compared to the typical commercial airliner), it has a relatively high CPFH \u2014 and as noted, taxpayers would be footing the bill for those hefty fixed costs whether the President flew or not. The CPFH figure is also highly misleading because if the President used Air Force One more often than he actually does, that additional usage would cause the CPFH to drop, and it would paradoxically seem as the President were saving taxpayer money by spending more of it.\n\nWhatever the true cost of the President\u2019s using Air Force One might be, how much of that cost do U.S. taxpayers bear when the purpose of the trip is political? That side of the equation is less clear. Federal Election Commission rules require that the government be reimbursed for whatever percentage of a President\u2019s trip is devoted to campaigning, based on the cost of chartering a similar-sized (or slightly smaller) commercial plane to carry campaign-related personnel on an identical trip. According to the Washington Post, that cost is currently about $11,000 per hour. We don\u2019t know exactly how much more it costs taxpayers when Air Force One is in the air rather than on the ground, but it\u2019s probably greater than $11,000 per hour (and quite a bit less than $200,000 per hour).\n\nThis issue is something of an unwinnable one for a President \u2014 it\u2019s not illegal for a President to spend time campaigning, for himself or for others, but with rare exceptions the President isn\u2019t allowed to travel on any aircraft other than Air Force One. And President Obama (or his party) is already paying much more for campaign use of Air Force One than his predecessor did: prior to 2009 (when Barack Obama took office), the presidential reimbursement for political travel only amounted to a few hundred dollars per hour, so President George W. Bush paid significantly less per flight to take Air Force One on political trips than President Obama does.\n\nIn the specific case of the campaign trip President Obama took with Hillary Clinton to North Carolina, official paperwork showed that the Clinton campaign reimbursed the government $36,602.99 for the use of Air Force One on 5 July 2016 \u2014 pretty close to the going rate, it sounds like, but perhaps still no bargain for the American people.", "lang": "en"}
