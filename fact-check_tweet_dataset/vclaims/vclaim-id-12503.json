Our national idea is power, arrogance and rudeness,\u201d Serebryakov said.\n\nCreating a \u201cRussian national idea\u201d has been a key part of Putin\u2019s presidential agenda since his coming to power nearly two decades ago. \u201cPatriotism is the Russians\u2019 holy duty. That is our national idea,\u201d Putin said in his speech before the students of the Moscow State University in 2016.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church joined the Putin narrative, announcing that the national idea of Russia is to \u201cbe holy.\u201d\n\nSerebryakov\u2019s opinion is clearly different.\n\nBut RIA\u2019s characterization of Serebryakov\u2019s statements as \u201canti-Russian\u201d are misleading.\n\nTo disagree with and criticize the current government for historical revisionism and to state it has incited conflicts at home and abroad, correct or not, is clearly an opinion regarding policy and not nationality.\n\nSerebryakov said as much in comments to RIA Novosti, stating he is \u201ca patriot of Russia, no less than those who shout about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince I am a citizen of Russia, I have a civil position which is connected with the fact that war is a terrible tragedy comparable with planetary cataclysms,\u201d he said, adding that life is priceless and he is an \u201cactive pacifist against war.\u201d\n\nEven his previous comments can be interpreted as much as his Hobbesian view on life in the Russian provinces (a prominent feature of one critically-acclaimed film in which he starred, Leviathan) as anti-Russian sentiment.\n\nSerebryakov, who immigrated to Canada with his family in 2012, faced a harsh backlash at that time, with Leviathan producer Alexander Rodnyansky claiming the public outrage only served to prove the actor\u2019s point.\n\n\"Unfortunately, here in Russia we are familiar with such attacks,\u201d Rodnyansky told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"Serebryakov's opinion can be irritating to someone and people have the right to disagree with him, but the harassment that ensued, calls to strip him of his Russian passport and ban him from ever working again \u2014 this just proves his point, that the Russian society is ill,\" he said.\n\nWriting for Vedomosti, Pavel Artekar said \u201cmaybe the actor\u2019s words were a little clumsy,\u201d noting that \u2018\u201dpower, arrogance and rudeness\u2019 cannot be said to define the national identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe description better fits the behavior of Russia\u2019s bureaucrats \u2014 at home and abroad \u2014 in recent years,\u201d Artekar said.\n\nLeviathan itself was similarly lambasted at home for being anti-Russian, with Orthodox Christian activist Kirill Frolov calling it \u201ca filthy libel against the Russian church and the Russian state\u201d and Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky attacking it for alleged inauthenticity.\n\n\u201cHowever much the authors made them swear and swig liters of vodka, that doesn\u2019t make them real Russians. I did not recognize myself, my colleagues, acquaintances or even acquaintances of acquaintances in \u2019Leviathan\u2019s\u2019 characters,\u201d the New York Times cites Medinsky as telling the newspaper Izvestia. \u201cStrange, but among the movie\u2019s characters there is not a single positive one.\u201d\n\nOther popular artists in Russia have similarly faced accusations of anti-Russian sentiment when criticizing government policy.\n\nRock star Andrei Makarevich was attacked for his decision to perform in Eastern Ukraine territory under Ukrainian government control, with Yevgeny Fedorov, an MP for the ruling United Russia party, saying he should be stripped of his state awards.\n\nIn 2014, following Russia\u2019s military incursion into Ukraine, Makarevich found himself alongside fellow rock star Yuri Shevchuk and three political figures \u2013 Ilya Ponomarev, Aleksei Navalny and Boris Nemtsov \u2013 on a banner hung from House of books reading \u201cFifth column. Foreigners among us.\u201d\n\nOf those five men, Navalny has been regularly attacked and blinded in an acid attack, Ponomarev was forced into exile and Nemtsov was murdered outside the Kremlin four years ago on February 27, 2015. All four have been detained and arrested on multiple occasions for organizing or taking part in opposition marches.\n\nRussian actress Liya Akhedzhakova, a critic of the Kremlin\u2019s policy, last month said that young people are now afraid to express their civic position.\u201d\n\nShe added. \"Today there is a lot of Sovietism. There\u2019s snitching. There\u2019s denunciations \u2026 it\u2019s generally a tradition in Russia. To knock, to pawn people.\u201d\n\nShe brought up the case of Alexander Sokurov, a renowned director who correctly predicted his Example of Intonation foundation would be targeted due to his criticism of Putin and the Russian government.\n\nMeanwhile, while Russian singer Yuri Loza said Serebryakov should no longer be offered roles and producer Joseph Prigozhin said some people\u2019s minds \u201care simply missing\u201d in relation to the controversy, actor Alexei Panin said Serebryakov is understood by every reasonable person and \u201ceverything he said was correct.\u201d\n\nAs to Serebryakov\u2019s claims about Russian involvement in Africa, there is plenty of evidence Russia focuses on propping up fragile nations battling civil war, such as the Central Africa Republic.\n\n\u201cThe current Kremlin is trying to export counterrevolution,\u201d Kiril Avramov told the Voice of America Russian Service. The post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Intelligence Studies Project said than destabilizing regimes, Russia looks for countries already besieged.\n\nLast year, Russia proposed a logistic base in Eritrea, an East African country emerging from decades of conflict with a neighbor.", "lang": "en"}
