This is misleading; they are a family of viruses, which explains the presence of the reference on the labels before SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, Lysol\u2019s manufacturer told AFP.\n\n\u201cUNBELIEVABLE !!! how the government is playing with everyone. Apparently the Coronavirus is \u2018new\u2019 and they can\u2019t find a cure for it!!!,\u201d a post shared 2,500 times on Facebook claims. \u201cThe CORONAVIRUS has existed for a long time, so long that the product LYSOL which has been on the market in aerosol form since 1962 has it in its label as a virus that can be killed by the simple application of it.\u201d\n\nThe post includes several close-ups of the brand\u2019s disinfectant spray, including one of the back of the bottle and its label, with the mention \u201cHuman Coronavirus\u201d circled.\n\n\u201cJust another way that the government and pharmaceutical companies use to scare people and fill their pockets with money by selling placebo medicine, face masks, gloves and the government controlling economies of countries that they want to hurt and attack economically,\u201d the post says.\n\nSimilar posts have been shared here, here and here on Facebook, as well as here on Twitter, and here on Instagram. The same claim has also been made in Spanish here and here.\n\nBut these claims are misleading.\n\n\u201cCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says on its website. \u201cThe virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.\u201d\n\nThe novel coronavirus is a new strain, also known as SARS-CoV-2, that was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.\n\nOn July 6, 2020 the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the approval of two Lysol products, based on laboratory testing, as effective in killing SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces.\n\nLysol products had already been tested against older strains of coronaviruses prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, confirmed Reckitt Benckiser, the manufacturer of the disinfectants.\n\n\u201cTo clarify, human coronavirus refers to the family of coronaviruses, hence why our labels referred to this before SARS-CoV-2 was discovered,\u201d the company told AFP by email.\n\nIn a statement released on May 27 the company cited data published by the American Journal of Infection Control which, it said, confirms the active ingredients in Dettol and Lysol \u201care effective in breaking the chain of infection of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThis was the first published assessment of its kind, the company said.\n\nIn February 2020, Reckitt Benckiser told AFP it was \u201caware of the speculations about Lysol\u201d but did not have access to the new virus for testing and was \u201cnot yet in a position to confirm levels of effectiveness against the new strain.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked similar claims circulating about Dettol, another Reckitt Benckiser product.\n\nAs of July 14, COVID-19 infections totalled more than 13 million across the world, with more than half in the United States and Latin America. The United States is the worst-hit country with 3,364,918 cases and 135,635 deaths, so far.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes the danger of asymptomatic transmission of the new coronavirus and recommends cloth face coverings when around others. The organization also recommends people wash their hands often, clean surfaces regularly, cover their coughs and sneezes, and avoid close contact.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 560 myths and other misinformation about the new coronavirus.
