They acknowledge that big banks are doing well but say the president was referring to community banks, generally defined as having less than $10 billion in assets. One official said the administration was developing policies that would specifically help the community banking sector.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law in 2010, was developed in response to banking abuses and regulatory shortcomings exposed by the Great Recession of 2007-2008. It has long been derided by Republican and industry critics as overly complex and burdensome for the financial community \u2014 although some experts say that many large institutions have spent a fortune building compliance operations to satisfy the law and so may be reluctant to go back to a less-regulated system.\n\n\u201cSince 1994, community banks\u2019 share of the U.S. lending market has fallen by approximately half \u2014 from 41 percent to 22 percent \u2014 while the top five largest banks\u2019 share has more than doubled \u2014 from 17 percent to 41 percent,\u201d the report says. The number of community banks shrank from 10,329 in the second quarter of 1994 to 5,521 banks in the third quarter of 2016, according to FDIC data.\n\n\u201cRealistically much of Dodd-Frank doesn\u2019t apply to community banks under $10 billion in assets,\u201d said Stephen M. Klein, a former bank regulator now at the law firm of Miller Nash Graham & Dunn in Seattle. \u201cIt was more of the restrictive regulatory environment and attitude that prevailed post recession and the array of bank failures.\u201d He said that the historically low interest rates after the recession savaged banks\u2019 profit margins, with the enhanced regulatory environment \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d for small banks.\n\nAn especially burdensome regulation that limits lending is tangentially related to Dodd-Frank, Merski said. A regulation known as U.S. Basel III overhauled U.S. bank capital standards, and a provision in Dodd-Frank known as the Collins amendment prevents regulators from adjusting capital requirements for different-size banks. The ICBA is seeking a repeal of the Collins amendment, arguing that it makes it harder for small banks to attract capital. Moreover, he said, it has forced smaller banks to consolidate, reducing the footprint of small banks in communities.\n\nWhite House officials pointed to FDIC data to make the case that loans to small businesses have fallen in the era of the Dodd-Frank law. The data, which White House officials walked us through, shows that the number of commercial loans under $1 million has fallen 14 percent from 2008 to the third quarter of 2016, compared with an increase of 51 percent for large business loans in the same period.\n\n\u201cIt is true that anecdotally, credit unions and small banks seem to complain about the costs of compliance to Dodd-Frank, which increase the costs of originating loans and hence increase credit denial to small businesses. But to my knowledge, there is no data currently available that can let us assess this claim scientifically,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had to assess Trump\u2019s claim, I would say that it seems to reflect the sentiment of small businesses and local banks, but it is not supported or disproved by scientific evidence beyond any doubt.\u201d\n\nOf course, there is no rule that every business loan needs to be granted. There may have been sound business reasons for denying loans that have little to do with Dodd-Frank. But a case could be made that the post-Dodd-Frank regulatory environment made it harder for community banks to make small-business loans.", "lang": "en"}
