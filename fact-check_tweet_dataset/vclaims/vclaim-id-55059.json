{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did Bill Gates Patent A \u2018CV19-N95\u2019 Face Mask Design Years Before The COVID-19 Pandemic?", "subtitle": "", "author": "checkyourfact.com", "date": "2020-07-24T18:06:39.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-55059", "url": "http://checkyourfact.com/2020/07/24/fact-check-bill-gates-patent-face-mask-coronavirus/", "vclaim": "An image shared on Facebook claims a man named Christopher Harrington was denied a patent in 2015 for a face mask design with the serial number CV19-N95 because Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had filed a similar patent six months earlier.\n\nNeither Gates nor Harrington filed a patent for a face mask under the Obama administration. The image derives from a satirical meme.\n\nThe image being shared purports Gates filed a patent for a face mask design with a serial number related to COVID-19 in 2015, preventing Harrington from successfully filing a similar patent that same year. Below the text, there is a photo of a man dressed in a business suit who is presumably Harrington.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, under the Obama Administration, Christopher Harrington attempted to file a patent for a new design of a face mask with a serial number CV19-N95,\u201d the image states. \u201cDo those numbers look familiar to you?\u201d\n\nThe text in the image seemingly draws a connection between the alleged serial number, CV19-N95, and names that have been associated with the coronavirus pandemic: COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and N95, a type of protective mask worn by health care workers and first responders.\n\n\u201cThe patent was denied because a similar one had been filed 6 months prior, by who??,\u201d the post continues. \u201cYou guessed it, Bill Gates. We are being controlled, people. Was this planned years ago?\u201d\n\nContrary to the post\u2019s claim, no such patent exists in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s (USPTO) patent database under Gates\u2018 name or Harrington\u2019s. The supposed serial number does not meet the requirements for a USPTO patent application, per the USPTO\u2019s guidelines. Gates does not appear to hold any patents for mask designs.\n\nThe new coronavirus first emerged in late 2019, roughly four years after Harrington and Gates supposedly filed the patent application.

His name bears a close resemblance to popular \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Kit Harington, whose given name is actually Christopher, though the image misspells the actor\u2019s surname.\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller found a nearly identical meme on the popular meme-sharing website iFunny with additional text, in which someone named Brett Lofgreen takes credit for the entire story, characterizing it as \u201ccompletely fake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made this whole thing up,\u201d the text states. \u201cThat\u2019s a stock photo I found when I googled old man in suit. Also, Christopher Harrington is the real name of the guy who played Jon Snow in Game of Thrones. Get it together people. Memes aren\u2019t news sources.\u201d\n\nA reverse image search revealed that the photo in question is, in fact, a stock image of a businessman.", "lang": "en"}
