He went up to it and smelt something rotting. He took the clothes off the scarecrow and discovered it was a human skeleton. This is the photo he took before authorities arrived.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe image in the post is gruesome, showing what looks like a desiccated body hung on branches like a scarecrow.\n\nAnd, well, it is a scarecrow. The photo is from a blog called \"The House of Marrow,\" which has recent posts with titles like, \"The Pumpkinrot Pilgrimage\" and \"Halloween 2013.\"\n\nBack in March 2012, a post titled \"Skeleton Country\" featured the image in the Facebook post among other angles of the scarecrow. The post is tagged with two labels \u2014 props and scarecrows \u2014 and the person who posted the photo under the name \"Marrow\" responded to some commenters admiring his handiwork.\n\n\"That\u2019s fantastic,\" someone wrote. \"It\u2019s sort of how I wish my scarecrow looked. Your anatomy looks great, too.\"\n\n\"Thanks so much!\" Marrow replied. \"He was originally going to have a cardboard box over his head \u2026 but it looked weird and awkward so I went with a burlap sack.\"\n\nMarrow later wrote in comments that he took the photos at an abandoned farmhouse outside of Wellington, New Zealand. On section of a Halloween-themed internet forum called \"props and prop building,\" Marrow said that the scarecrow corpse was \"built from scratch\" using newspaper and masking tape.", "lang": "en"}
