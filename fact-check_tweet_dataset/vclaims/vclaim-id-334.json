I Guess They Didn\u2019t Get The Memo.\u201d This is likely a response to conservative claims that Klan members in the late 19th and early 20th centuries supported the Democratic party (here).\n\nPublished on the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 History, Art and Archives website, a history of African American political realignment after the Great Depression and New Deal can be found here . Information on the evolution of the Republican Party and the realignment of white voters from the 1960s onward can be found here .\n\nAnother version of the photo, seen here , shows Klan members holding banners in support of the antifascist protest movement Antifa \u2013 a group \u201cdriven by progressive ideology and workers\u2019 rights\u201d that has used violence to curb white supremacists, nationalists and conservatives, according to The Conversation ( here ). The photo also shows the Klan members waving communist hammer and sickle flags, adopted in 1922 as the Soviet Union\u2019s official symbol ( here ).\n\nThe photo of Klan supporters wearing robes and hoods and waving KKK and Confederate flags was taken on July 11, 2009, almost five years before Donald Trump announced his campaign for president in 2015 ( here ). The caption on the original image, taken by Getty and visible here , says that members of the Fraternal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan were participating in the 11th Annual Nathan Bedford Forrest Birthday march in Pulaski, Tennessee. As seen in the original photograph, the banner reads \u201cFraternal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d Other photos from this event can be found here .\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check Team previously debunked a photoshopped picture of Vice President Mike Pence holding a Confederate flag, viewed as a symbol of racism by some and a reminder of Southern heritage by others (here) .\n\nDuring his campaign for president in 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump gained the support of former KKK leader David Duke. On February 26, 2016, Trump said he was unaware of Duke\u2019s endorsement and that he disavowed it ( here ).\n\nFalse. This image was photoshopped from a 2009 photo of Klan members in Tennessee holding a banner that reads \u201cFraternal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d not \u201cTRUMP PENCE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
