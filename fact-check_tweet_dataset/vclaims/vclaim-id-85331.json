It is being shared with the claim that the man hails from the Muslim community. A Facebook user posted the viral video and wrote, \u201cJihadis are applying spit on bread as well (translated from \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0921 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0940 \u0925\u0942\u0915 \u0932\u0917\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0926\u0940).\u201d This video has been viewed over 5,500 times. (archive link)\n\nAnother Facebook user Anil Singh made a similar claim and posted the viral video on Facebook. It was viewed over 7,000 times and shared over 900 times (archive link).\n\nAlt News has received several requests to fact-check this video on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application\n\nAlt News analysed the video using InVid, a video verification tool, and performed a reverse image search using Google. We found that the video was published by Philippines-based news website ABS-CBN News on September 20, 2019. According to the report, \u201c[Baker] Gardenia Philippines on Friday said that the delivery personnel caught on camera tampering with a loaf of bread was dealing with stocks scheduled for disposal and not from fresh stocks for deliveries.\u201d Another Philippines-based news outlet SAGISAG also published a report on this incident.\n\nThe brand clarified the matter on its Facebook page on September 19, 2019. The statement added, \u201cthe delivery man took out bread slices from pulled out loaves for his personal use. This is a violation of company rules and procedures. The personnel involved is now undergoing administrative due process.\u201d\n\nNone of the reports on the issue has named the offender or reported any specifics about the person. Thus, terming him a \u2018jihadi\u2019 \u2013 a derogatory word used for Muslims \u2013 is an act of manufactured misinformation meant to delegitimize the Muslim community. Alt News has been regularly debunking such false claims in recent times. Earlier, a video of a restaurant employee packing food was shared with the false claim that a Muslim man was spitting on the food. Note: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India exceeds 5,000 and more than 150 deaths have so far been reported. The government has imposed a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services to tackle the pandemic. Globally, more than 14 lakh confirmed cases and over 80,000 deaths have been reported. There is a sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a pandemic, can take lives.
