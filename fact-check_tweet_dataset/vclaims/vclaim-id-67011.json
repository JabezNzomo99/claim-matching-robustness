The claim, however, is false; this video has circulated online since 2019 and actually shows a street in India.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on August 26, 2020. It has been viewed more than 748,000 times and shared some 28,000 times.\n\nThe 30-second clip shows a crocodile being pulled by a rope on a flooded street. Bystanders can be heard screaming as they watch.\n\nThe video\u2019s Urdu caption translates to English as: \u201cAfter heavy rain, the crocodiles of Manghopir are out. Beware the crocodiles. Share this post.\u201d\n\nManghopir is a neighbourhood in the outskirts of Karachi. It is famed for its shrine to the Sufi saint Haji Syed Shaikh Sultan, which has a pond populated by dozens of crocodiles.\n\nHeavy rain lashed the Pakistani port city in August, causing widespread flooding that killed dozens and left many homeless. Here is a local report on the damage caused by the downpour.\n\nThe video was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook, alongside similar claims. It was also posted here claiming to be in Sudan.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google using video keyframes found a video of the same scene shot from a different angle, published here on the YouTube channel of Indian newspaper Times of India on August 4, 2019.\n\nThe video description states: \u201cDue to waterlogging by the ongoing heavy rains, further incidents of crocodiles entering Vadodara\u2019s housing complexes have been recorded. Following last week\u2019s viral video of a crocodile attacking a dog inside Lalbaug\u2019s Rajsthamb society, a team of rescuers captured another reptile at night from the entrance of a house. Meanwhile, a 10-foot-long crocodile gave a hard time to forest officials at a society in Vadsar. As the water levels rise in the Lalbaug lake, crocodiles come out and enter the housing societies adjacent to it.\u201d\n\nVadodara is a city in the Indian state of Gujarat.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the Time of India video (L) and the video in the misleading Facebook post (R), with identical features circled in blue, red and green by AFP:\n\nThe state-run Sindh Wildlife Department in Karachi also denied the claims in this August 24, 2020 tweet.\n\nIt reads: \u201cSindh Wildlife Officials Hasnain & Naeem, deputed for covering wildlife issues within Karachi city premises rushed 2 shrine of 'Mangho Pir' on news spread on social media regarding escape of sacred crocodile having historical significance with the shrine\n\n The news proved baseless!\u201d", "lang": "en"}
