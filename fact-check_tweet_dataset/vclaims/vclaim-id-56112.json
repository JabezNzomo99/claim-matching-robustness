Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nThe post doing rounds on Facebook by a user named Mohit Choubey reads: \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t eat cabbage, as per WHO report, the coronavirus stays in cabbage for a very long time. On usual objects, the strains last for at least 9-12 hours, whereas the strain of the virus lasts more than 30 hours on cabbage. People are advised to stay away from cabbage.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News searched about any such information on the website of World Health Organization (WHO). The official website of WHO does not include any warning regarding the consumption of cabbage.\n\nWe further investigated and found a food safety report on the website of Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC). As per the report, \u2018there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.\u2018\n\nAnother report by European Food Safety Authority, \u201cthere no evidence that food is a source or transmission route for coronavirus.\u201d\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Vimal N. of Ministy of AYUSH. He said: \u201cEvery vegetable should be wash thoroughly before use. Eat more Leafy veggies and vitamin source veggies to improve your immunity to fight against any disease. It is important to stay away from these viruses and also from such fake and unscientific news.\u201d\n\nAs per Dr. A.C. Mishra, Joint Director, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) \u201cThere is no evidence to support transmission of coronavirus through food. Before consuming food, it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. It is also important to wash to fruits and vegetables properly before consuming.\n\nWe also performed social scanning of the user who shared the viral post. Upon investigation we found that the user hails from Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe claim has been falsely attributed to Chinese doctors and Taiwanese doctors.\n\nDisclaimer: The article has been modified by removing some details which were not required or irrelevant to the article.
