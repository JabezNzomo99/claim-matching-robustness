This is false; a spokeswoman for the UN secretary-general told AFP that Guterres made no such statement.\n\n\n\n The article, which has been shared more than 2,500 times on Facebook by accounts sympathetic to the Biafran cause, was posted on a website known for sharing false information, The Pointer News. We\u2019ve archived the article itself here, and some of the Facebook posts sharing it here, here, and here.\n\nThe article claims that \u201cThe Secretary General of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, call on Biafrans, should \u2018Start teaching Biafra Nation Anthem to your citizen now.\u2019 Because, the establishment of Biafra as a Nation will soon be a reality.\u201d\n\nThe article, which contains just two paragraphs, adds that \u201cAccording to Biafra Newspaper, \u2018It is time for states marks for Biafra Republic, should start teaching Biafra Nation Anthem to its citizen\u2019.\u201d\n\nAFP searched through speeches made by the United Nations secretary-general -- which are publicly available in video on UN WebTV, and in text on the UN website -- and found no mention of such a call for Nigerians to be taught the Biafran anthem.\n\nWe also reached out to the secretary-general\u2019s media team to find out if he had made the comments in any message that was not recorded or transmitted in text for public consumption. Keishamaza Rukikaire, associate spokeswoman for the secretary-general, told AFP that \u201cthe reports are false\u201d.\n\nArticles falsely reporting expressions of support from world leaders for the Biafran cause often pop up online -- we\u2019ve debunked a couple of them here and here.\n\nSeparatists have been pushing for an independent Biafran state in eastern Nigeria for more than fifty years.\n\nA unilateral declaration of an independent republic of Biafra for the Igbo people who dominate southeast Nigeria was made in 1967, sparking a brutal civil war with federal forces that left more than one million people dead from the effects of conflict, starvation and disease.\n\nAfter the Nigerian military defeated the separatists, the region was re-integrated into Nigeria, but latent secessionist sentiment in the southeast remains.", "lang": "en"}
