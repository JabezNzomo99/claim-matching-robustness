The video is actually computer-generated and was created by a Japanese artist as an April Fool\u2019s joke. While some commenters on the posts acknowledged the video was not real, many appeared to believe that it was.\n\nThe clip, in which a white blimp bearing the logo of international tech firm Amazon appears to glide through the air beside a hill and above a town as multiple small drones emerge from it and fly away in different directions, has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe video posts have different captions. For example, this one viewed around 300,000 times since it was published to Facebook on April 1, 2019 \u2013 April Fool\u2019s day \u2013 says: \u201ca step closer to the dystopian world i crave\u201d.\n\nAnother Facebook post published April 2 here contains the same video which has been viewed 14,000 times alongside the caption \u201camazon overlord mothership sends out fighter drones\u201d.\n\nOther Facebook posts, viewed fewer times, have captions which claim the video shows \u201cAmazon's delivery drones in action!\u201d here and that \u201cAmazon now has a Drone Aircraft Carrier, that flies\u201d here. Similar claims have also been made on Twitter, for example here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the Facebook posts:\n\nThe image below contains screenshots of selected comments from the Facebook posts that indicate the commenters believed that the video was real. The identity of the commenters has been redacted.\n\nFor example, one person wrote: \u201cThe future is N O W\u201d while another person wrote to their friend: \u201cWeren\u2019t you just arguing with me saying something like this WOULDNT ever happen lol\u201d.\n\nHowever, some of the commenters and media reports on the video such as here in Gizmodo and here on news.com.au pointed to this twitter thread by Japanese user @zozi009 who said they had made the clip using CGI (computer-generated images).\n\nAFP\u2019s Tokyo bureau translated the tweets and the description in the account\u2019s bio, which says:\n\n\"Bored person making various videos. AKA person of Itsukushima Shrine. Mainly on Nico-Doh but recently posting strange videos on Twitter. Moved all the girls of PSvita's KanColle on Live2D for work. Details are on blog. Teaching 3D at vocational school. Please RT\"\n\nThe tweet embedded below contains the same video as the online posts and says in Japanese:\n\n\u201cThere were rumours about delivery by drones but I didn't know it has already started. I thought it was for the future\u201d with an English translation and the hashtags: \u201c#Aprilfool #zozifilming\u201d\n\nThe second tweet contains three pictures showing the method used to create the video clip, involving a 3D netting model of the blimp.\n\nIt says: \u201cSpoilers in the afternoon. I don't think anyone believes it, but just in case. I created HDRI with thetaV and did the writing. I added extra stuff on the background but it seems not many noticed it.\u201d\n\nHRDI stands for high-dynamic-range imaging and and thetaV is a type of spherical camera, for example this one for sale \u2013 on Amazon.\n\nThe second tweet is embedded below:\n\nA third tweet from @zozi009 here says the blimp in the clip was inspired by a real airship developed by defence company Lockheed Martin, which can be seen in this Youtube video published by the company on August 24, 2010, embedded below:\n\nAmazon is developing a drone delivery system called \u201cPrime Air\u201d, described on its website here as \u201ca future delivery system from Amazon designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones.\u201d\n\nOn the same page it says this system is being tested and is not yet operational: \u201cWe will deploy when and where we have the regulatory support needed to safely realize our vision.\u201d\n\nOne Twitter user who posted the clip here on April 1 with the caption \u201cThis right here is borderline dystopian\u201d in a post that was retweeted more than 23,000 times later posted another tweet acknowledging the video was false.\n\nThe user\u2019s second tweet, embedded below, said: \u201cok update this is just some late stage capitalism CG!\", referring to computer graphics.", "lang": "en"}
