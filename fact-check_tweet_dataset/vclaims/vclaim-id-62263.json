Commentators on international relations see China\u2019s hand behind this.\n\nOn Facebook, several users have posted the 35-second clip a top shot of a large number of people marching on the streets. The caption in Bengali along with the video translates to, \u201cThe people of Nepal have started revolting against their Prime Minister for acting like a pimp of China. We thank the people of Nepal. Long live the brotherly relation between India and Nepal.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim with the video is misleading. The protest video is indeed from Kathmandu but the people were demonstrating against the Nepal government for its alleged failure to control the spread of Covid-19, and also against lockdown.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here and here. The viral post has been shared by multiple Facebook users.\n\nWith the help of InVID and reverse image search, we found that the viral video was uploaded by a YouTube channel called \u201cKinima TV\u201d on June 11. The title of the video says, \u201cPeople hit the streets in Nepal protesting against the lockdown\u201d.\n\nWe found still pictures of the same protest tweeted by senior Nepalese journalist and presenter Anita Bindu on June 11, calling it an uprising of Nepali youth against the government.\n\nNews reports of the protest march on several Nepalese news websites and YouTube channels confirm that the country had witnessed strong anti-government demonstrations in early June against the Oli government\u2019s alleged failure to handle the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to these news reports, on June 11, a gathering of hundreds of people marching towards Kathmandu\u2019s Baluwatar area near the Prime Minister\u2019s residence faced stiff resistance from Nepalese police, who used water cannons and batons against the protesters.\n\nNepal was under lockdown since March 24, and people wanted a better alternative from the government to handle the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nIt is true that pressure is building up on PM Oli from inside and outside his party after the map dispute with India.\n\nBut the viral video of people protesting against the Nepal government is not related to its pro-China stance but the Oli government\u2019s alleged failure to control the Covid-19 pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
