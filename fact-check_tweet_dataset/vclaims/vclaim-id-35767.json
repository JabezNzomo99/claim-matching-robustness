She reported that the picture was taken in the early hours before the protesters started pouring-in. \u201cThis (picture) was taken at 8 am when only volunteers were sleeping inside and women protesters hadn\u2019t come out,\u201d Kumar said. At around 9:00 am, women protesters started coming in and by 12:00 pm there were hundreds of protesters at the site, she added. The protest continued in the evening with hundreds of protesters continuing their demonstration in the area. The second part of both these reports mentions that the protesters didn\u2019t show up because AAP is coming back to power in Delhi. But, in reality, the protesters began a silent protest holding placards which read that they don\u2019t support any political party. Speaking to The Quint, a participant Shabnam said that the silent protest is against the alleged police crackdown on Jamia students. \u201cWe are neither happy with anyone\u2019s victory nor sad about anyone\u2019s defeat.\u201d Shabnam told The Quint. Shaheen Bagh protest has been going on for almost 55 days and has become a symbol of resistance against NRC, CAA and police brutality. And while the Supreme Court is slated to hear the matter of the protesters blocking the public roads and causing inconvenience to people on 17 February, the protesters aren\u2019t defiant and say that the apex court\u2019s order will be acceptable to them. While it remains unclear as to when will the protesters move from the location, but as of 11 February, men and women of Shaheen Bagh continued to raise their voice against the establishment.
