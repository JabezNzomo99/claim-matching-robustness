Even China tried to buy this (drone) but as it opposes India, Israel denied selling it to China. You also watch this amazing drone),\u201d is a message currently viral on social media, accompanied with a CGI video of combat aircrafts and drones.\n\nSeveral individual users have shared the 6:16 minutes clip.\n\nAlt News found that the video has been floating on both Twitter and Facebook with the identical claim since last year.\n\nThe viral video carried the stamp \u2013 \u2018Semenov Dahir Kurmanbievich\u2019. When Alt News looked up the phrase on YouTube, we found that it was the name of a Russian inventor, Dahir Semenov. We discovered his YouTube channel where, in 2016, he had uploaded the same video which is currently viral on social media.\n\nWe also found his LinkedIn and Facebook profiles which said that he is a Russian citizen currently residing in Turkey.\n\nSemenov is also a director of a technology company called Dahir Insaat Corporation, which provides clients with construction techniques. He made news in 2015 for designing an earthquake-proof bed.\n\nIn the aftermath of Pulwama attack, Israel offered \u201cunconditional help\u201d to India to tackle terrorism. Recently, the Indian government also approved 54 killer drones from Israel made for the Indian air force. However, the viral video is not representative of the India-Israel defence deal as it was a concept design uploaded by a Russian inventor.", "lang": "en"}
