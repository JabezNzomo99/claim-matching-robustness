But the image has been doctored \u2014 in the original, he\u2019s reading a bible the right way up.\n\nAn article based on the picture, titled: \u201cProphet Shepherd Bushiri Reading The Bible Facing UpSide Down\u201d has been shared more than 1,300 times on Facebook since February 19.\n\nBut as one commenter pointed out on Facebook, if the bible was indeed being read upside-down, the front cover would appear in Bushiri\u2019s right hand. In the doctored photo, it\u2019s in his left hand.\n\nClose-up, the blurred oval shape appearing around the text on the bible indicates the photo may have been doctored, as does the alignment of the text -- you would expect it to be centered on a book cover, and it's a touch more to the right than it should be.\n\nMaynard Manyowa, external media relations manager of Bushiri\u2019s church, shared the original image in response to the fake.\n\nBushiri, a controversial pastor and self-proclaimed prophet, often makes local headlines, most recently when he and his wife were arrested on money-laundering and fraud charges.\n\nHe isn\u2019t the only one: a surge in controversial pastors led South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to call on people to work together to rid the country of questionable religious leaders.\n\n\"Those who are doing things that are completely shocking, of trying to hoodwink the whole nation and saying that someone has been raised from the dead, it is actually bringing the name of the Lord, of God and of churches into disrepute,\" Ramaphosa said this week.\n\nRamaphosa\u2019s plea came after a pastor in South Africa claimed to have performed a resurrection -- see this AFP report for more.", "lang": "en"}
