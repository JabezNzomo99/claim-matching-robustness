The post with this caption \u2013 Exclusive: Bill Gates publicly rebukes Nigeria\u2019s Leaders \u2013 reads:\n\n\u201cI have invested $1.6Billion in Nigeria economy with no result. When a clueless idiot is the president and a decorated fool is the Vice President and cabinet members are notorious robbers, the result is nothing but economic calamity and holocaust.\u201d\n\nThe post has gathered 99 Retweets, 220 Likes and 81 comments on Twitter.\n\nFirst, we conducted a google reverse image search and it turns out that the picture had never surfaced online, except in the tweet. Next, we searched for interviews featuring Bill Gates and we were able to match where the picture must\u2019ve emanated from \u2013 an interview with the CNN!\n\nIn the original video of the interview CNN conducted with Bill Gates on YouTube, Bill Gates is seen talking about his return from Nigeria and the need for Nigerian politicians to focus on human capital and its large youth population.\n\nHe stated that the Foundation is spending $1.6 billion on programs in Nigeria, most of it his money and that he feels it is time for Nigeria\u2019s government to do better.\n\nNevertheless, he did not not call Nigeria\u2019s president a clueless idiot and the Vice President a decorated fool. Bill Gates merely directed his words to the politicians in the country.\n\nThis post is a clear case of misleading content. Yes, Bill Gates bemoaned the state of Nigeria\u2019s economy and health. However, he never made those extreme words!", "lang": "en"}
