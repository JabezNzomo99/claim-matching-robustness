Over 100 animals have also died in the Kaziranga National Park. Rakshith Shivaram who identifies himself as Former State Secretary, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, drew over 31,000 likes and close to 8,000 retweets for the images.\n\nThe images were also carried on the front page of Gujarat-based Sandesh News.\n\nOne Susanta Nanda IFS tweeted one of the same images during the 2019 Assam floods, \u201cHero\u2019s are made by the paths they choose & not by the power they grace.

According to a photo-story by UK-based Daily Mail, the incident took place in Noakhali, Bangladesh where wildlife photographer Hasibul Wahab had captured this brave act by a teenager named Belal. \u201cDuring the ordeal onlookers were unsure whether the boy was going to appear again. When he finally made it to the other side the locals cheered as the deer was reunited with its family.\u201d, stated the report.\n\nThe report includes several pictures of the incident.\n\nIn 2016, Assam government in a major goof-up had included one such image in its interim report on Assam floods to Union home minister Rajnath Singh.\n\nThe other image was shot during the 2016 floods in Andhra Pradesh.
