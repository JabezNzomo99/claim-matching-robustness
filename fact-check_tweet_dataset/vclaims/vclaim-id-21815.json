And we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. You see what\u2019s going on; you see the numbers. We\u2019ve created over 600,000 jobs already in a very short period of time, and it\u2019s going to really start catching on now, because some of the things that we\u2019ve done are big league and they are catching on. Already, we\u2019ve created more than almost 600,000 jobs. And yesterday, Toyota just announced that it will invest more than $1.3 billion \u2014 it\u2019s probably going to be $1.9 billion \u2014 into its Georgetown, Kentucky, plant, an investment that would not have been made if we didn\u2019t win the election.\n\nToyota announced on April 10 that it will spend $1.33 billion upgrading its assembly plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, as it works on a new model of the Camry. The car, according to the statement, \u201cwill become the first Toyota vehicle made in the U.S. to fully incorporate the new vehicle development and production technology\u201d under the Toyota New Global Architecture.\n\nBut Trump is wrong that the \u201cinvestment \u2026 would not have been made if we didn\u2019t win the election.\u201d\n\nToyota spokesman Aaron Fowles told us in an interview that the investment \u201cpredates the Trump administration\u201d and had been planned \u201cseveral years ago.\u201d Another company spokesman told the New York Times the same thing.\n\nThe investment is actually part of a bigger plan to spend $10 billion dollars in the U.S. over the next five years, which Toyota President Akio Toyoda announced back on Jan. 9.\n\nThat announcement came days after Trump threatened to penalize the Japanese automaker for its plan to produce cars in Mexico that would be sold to consumers in the U.S. But Toyota executives said that the company\u2019s plans to increase spending in the U.S. were not in response to Trump\u2019s threat, according to news reports.\n\nIn fact, Toyota, according to its April 10 statement, previously invested $530 million in the Kentucky plant in 2013 in part to support production of a new model of Lexus.\n\nFowles confirmed reports that the latest investment won\u2019t create any new jobs at the Kentucky plant, but, he said, that\u2019s because Toyota already added more than 700 employees at the plant last year.\n\nMany CEOs have said they are encouraged by Trump\u2019s promises to cut business taxes and regulations. But in the end, this is just the latest example of Trump claiming undeserved credit for company investments that were largely market-driven and that were in the works before he was elected.\n\nIn the same meeting with business leaders, Trump also claimed that his administration has \u201ccreated over 600,000 jobs already in a very short period of time.\u201d That\u2019s wrong \u2014 by a lot.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 219,000 jobs were added in February and about 98,000 more in March. That\u2019s a total of 317,000 jobs in the two full months with Trump as president. The January job numbers were based on a survey that was concluded before Trump took office on January 20.\n\nAnd even if we did include the estimated 216,000 jobs added in January, that would only bring the total to 533,000, not \u201cover 600,000.\u201d\n\nThe White House told Politico that the president was indeed counting jobs added in January. We asked for our own explanation, but the White House didn\u2019t respond.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, this positive jobs trend is not something that began in January, or even after the election. The economy added more than 250,000 new jobs a month in 20 of the 96 months under President Obama, and as of March, the U.S. has had 78 straight months of job growth.\n\nThe job gain in March actually underperformed expectations, even as the unemployment rate dipped to 4.5 percent.\n\nCorrection, Oct. 27: The U.S. had 78 straight months of job growth through March, not 77 as we originally wrote.", "lang": "en"}
