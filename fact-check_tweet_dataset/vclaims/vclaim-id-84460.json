In recent times, AAP social media volunteers especially have had to work hard because of party\u2019s poor performance in Punjab/Goa state assembly elections and Delhi MCD elections. In the latest fiasco, a person called Ankit Bhardwaj, who claims to be a AAP party worker, reportedly attacked Kapil Mishra. The attack happened at the place where Kapil Mishra has started an indefinite fast for protesting against the alleged corruption of AAP leaders.\n\nSoon after the attack, many prominent AAP social media volunteers started alleging that one Ankit Bhardwaj who is associated with Bhartiya Janta Yuva Morcha which is BJP\u2019s youth wing was responsible for the attack and that he\u2019s portraying himself to be an AAP volunteer.\n\nEven the official Aam Aadmi Party Twitter handle put out a video alleging the same, they have now deleted this tweet, but we managed to get a screenshot.\n\nThe video which has now been deleted can be seen here:\n\nArvind Kejriwal also retweeted this allegation via his Twitter account, the tweet by twitter handle @DaarubazMehta has now been deleted.\n\nAs it turns out, the Ankit Bhardwaj who is associated with BJYM was not responsible for the attack and he\u2019s clarified the same on his Facebook timeline.\n\nHe has also stated the same before media channels that he wasn\u2019t the one who attacked Kapil Mishra and that he\u2019s being unnecessarily defamed.\n\nIn this constant political battle between different parties on social media parties, truth often becomes the first casualty.", "lang": "en"}
