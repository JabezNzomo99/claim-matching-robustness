This is false; autopsies confirmed Floyd\u2019s death, and personnel files of the officers involved are available online.\n\nAnother Facebook post says: \u201cI think there is at the very least the \u2018possibility\u2019, that this was a filmed public execution of a black man by a white cop, with the purpose of creating racial tensions.\u201d\n\nFloyd, a 46-year-old, died on May 25, 2020 after white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The incident was caught on camera by bystanders, and has sparked outrage across the country.\n\nHe \u201cbecame unresponsive while being restrained by law enforcement officers; he received emergency medical care in the field and subsequently in the Hennepin HealthCare (HHC) Emergency Department, but could not be resuscitated,\u201d it says.\n\nA private autopsy was also conducted at the request of Floyd\u2019s family.\n\nBut police personnel files for the officers involved -- Chauvin, Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- are available online. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, and the other three with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.\n\nAudio of the calls to first responders can also be heard in this visual investigation by The New York Times that reconstructs the chain of events.\n\n\u201cThe idea of \u2018crisis actors\u2019 implies that events were staged for some political purpose,\u201d Karen Douglas, professor of psychology at the University of Kent told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cThis follows a very common conspiracy narrative -- that all is not what it seems and we can't trust the people in charge,\u201d Douglas said.\n\nThao can be seen wearing an embroidered badge while Chauvin has a metal badge in footage of Floyd\u2019s arrest, encouraging conspiracy theories -- such as here and here -- that they were \u201cfake cops.\u201d But variations in badges and uniforms exist in the police workforce.\n\nMinneapolis police officers can be seen wearing various badges here, here and here. The full uniform policy of Minneapolis police can be found here.\n\nSuspicions also circulated about the license plate reading \u201cPOLICE\u201d on a vehicle at the scene of Floyd\u2019s arrest.\n\nBut plates with the word do exist in Minneapolis, and can be seen in a photo posted on the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s Facebook page here.\n\nVarious Facebook users -- in several posts and a video -- have claimed that Floyd was seen at his own funeral. The man pictured is actually Stephen Jackson, a former NBA player.\n\nThe original photo, found with a reverse image search, was taken during a rally for Floyd and was posted on the NBA\u2019s official website on May 29, identifying Jackson, as well as other basketball players, in the caption.\n\nOn his official Instagram page, Jackson has spoken about how he considered Floyd his \u201ctwin,\u201d his \u201cbrother,\u201d and how they were friends, posting pictures and videos of moments spent together.\n\n\u201cOne of our good friends, Stephen Jackson, who's a former NBA player, it just so happens that George was a friend of his, he used to call him twin, cause they look so much alike and, talking to Stephen, he said, \u2018Man, it could have been me,\u2019\u201d actor Jamie Foxx, who attended the rally with Jackson, said in a video posted on his official YouTube account on June, 4.\n\nHouston said farewell to Floyd in a rousing hometown funeral on June 9 with tributes and calls for justice for the 46-year-old African American. Some 500 guests were at the funeral, including Jackson.", "lang": "en"}
