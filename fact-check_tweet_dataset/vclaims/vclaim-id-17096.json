However, most of the presidents in these countries, especially in the last decade have been university graduates!\n\nIn response to Dubawa\u2019s fact check on whether a candidate for the office of the President of Nigeria requires a WAEC certificate, Festus Keyamo, spokesperson for the All Progressives Congress [APC] Presidential Campaign Council for the 2019 Presidential election, has again widened the scope of the debate on the educational requirement for becoming the President of a country.\n\nSpecifically mentioning Germany, France and the USA, Keyamo wrote on his Twitter wall that presidential hopefuls in these countries do not require to have any educational qualification to be president.\n\n\u201cEven the U.S, Germany & France have no educational requirement for the office of President,\u201d Keyamo tweeted, adding that, \u201cThese are HARD FACTS, not my personal view. We need to read the proceedings of the making of these Constitutions to know why they left it that way so our conversations may be more informed.\u201d\n\nHOW \u2018HARD\u2019 ARE THESE \u2018FACTS\u2019?\n\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 5 of the country\u2019s constitution speaks on the requirement for becoming president of the North American nation.\n\nThe Section highlights 3 minimum criteria to be qualified for seeking to land the number one job in the country as:\n\u2022 None be a natural-born U.S. citizen of the United States\n\u2022 None be at least thirty-five (35) years old;\n\u2022 be a resident in the United States for at least fourteen (14) years.\n\nIn spite of this, however, of the 44 individuals that have been presidents of the United States, 32 (73%) graduated from a university. Only 12 (27%) had no degree, two of whom \u2014 Abraham Lincoln and Adam Johnson \u2014 did not attend high school either. Also, every president since 1953, has had at least a Bachelor\u2019s Degree.\n\nBut then according to the law of the country, it is correct to say the United States of America has \u201cno educational requirement for the office of president.\u201d\n\nIn Germany, the office of the president is open to all Germans who are entitled to vote in the Bundestag elections and have reached the age of 40.\n\nA search through the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany (Grundgesetz, GG) accessed online shows that the term \u201ceducation\u201d appears only 14 times therein \u2014 none had anything to do with who becomes president of the Central European nation.\n\nAlso, Part V of this German constitution referred to as the Basic Law talks about becoming the Federal President (Bundespr\u00e4sident) of Germany. Article 54, subsection 1 of this part states that: \u201cThe Federal President shall be elected by the Federal Convention without debate. Any German who is entitled to vote in Bundestag elections and has attained the age of forty may be elected.\u201d\n\nFederal Convention in this statement is the largest parliamentary convention in Germany, convened in five years\u2019 interval, all things being equal, to elect a new Federal President. It is usually convened by the president of Bundestag.\n\nGermany runs a parliamentary system of government wherein the Chancellor (currently Angela Merkel) is the nation\u2019s leading political figure and de facto chief executive. The President, on the other hand, plays mainly a ceremonial role; he can, however, give direction on general political and societal debates.\n\nThere is no specific level of education required to become the Chancellor of Germany. Article 62 of the German constitution says the Chancellor shall be elected by the Bundestag without debate on the proposal of the President.\n\nThe person who receives the votes of a majority of the Members of the Bundestag shall be elected. The person elected shall be appointed by the Federal President.\n\nAs for this West European nation, the French constitution states that a candidate for a presidential election is required to:\n\u2022 None have attained the age of 18 years;\n\u2022 not be ineligible by reasons of criminal conviction or judicial decision;\n\nNote, the criteria above are same for any other position that requires official elections. This is as set forth in the French Electoral Code (Code \u00e9lectoral).\n\nIn addition to this, Law No. 62-1292 of 6 November 1962 on the election of the President by universal suffrage, stipulates that a presidential hopeful must be nominated by at least five hundred (500) qualified elected officials, such as members of Parliament and mayors. There are exactly 45,543 elected officials, including 33,872 mayors in France.\n\nJust like the USA and Germany, the level of education attained is not a yardstick to becoming the President of France.\n\nTo become president in any of the countries \u2013 United States, Germany or France \u2013 you do not need any educational requirement, according to the laws of these countries. However, most of the presidents in these countries, especially in the last decade have been university graduates!", "lang": "en"}
