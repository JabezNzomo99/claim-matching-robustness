American fact-checking website Snopeshad debunked this hoax and found that this narrative of Japan banning microwave ovens originated from a Russian satirical website. This satirical article was later published by several Spanish news outlets and then was shared on Facebook.\n\nA Russian website named, Panorama.pub, had published a piece with the title, \u201c\u042f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0421\u0412\u0427-\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u043a 2020 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 (Japan finally abandon microwave ovens by 2020 -Google translated)\u201d, on March 3, 2019.\n\nThe website at the bottom clearly highlights the fact that it is a satirical website when it says, \u201cSatirical publication \u201cPanorama\u201d. All texts on this website are grotesque parodies of reality and are not real news. (Google translated)\u201d\n\nThe Google translation of the introductory paragraph of this article matches the text of the viral message circulating on the Internet. The translation reads, \u201cThe Japanese government decided to dispose of all microwave ovens in the country before the end of this year. All citizens and organizations that do not fulfill the requirement are threatened with prison sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years, depending on the severity of the crime.\u201d Thus, the text of the message was directly copy-pasted from the satirical piece and circulated on the Internet as authentic news.", "lang": "en"}
