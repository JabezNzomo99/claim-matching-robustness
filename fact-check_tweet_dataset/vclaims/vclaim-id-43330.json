The video, however, doesn\u2019t show a scene in Venice.\n\nThe footage was actually shot hundreds of miles away in Cagliari, a city on the Italian island of Sardinia. The Italian newswire service ANSA tweeted and published the video on its website, with the translated captions saying, \u201cMascot dolphin of Luna Rossa in the port of Cagliari.\u201d\n\nAt press time, Italy has reported 80,589 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and 8,215 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.", "lang": "en"}
