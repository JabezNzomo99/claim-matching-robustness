[1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Chalmers\u2019 claim one-third of people who present to emergency departments are waiting longer than is clinically recommended.\n\nMr Chalmers and Labor leader Bill Shorten announced additional funding for hospital beds and staff at the ALP campaign launch in Brisbane on May 5, 2019. [2]\n\nWhen people go to emergency departments at Australia\u2019s hospitals, they are \u2018triaged\u2019 - allocated into one of five categories depending on the urgency of their ailment.\n\nThe recommended treatment time, according to an Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report, varies across the five categories of resuscitation, emergency, urgent, semi-urgent, non-urgent - from immediately to within 120 minutes. [3]\n\nAccording to the most recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data from 2017\u201318, there were more than eight million presentations to public hospital emergency departments, an increase of 3.4 per cent on the previous year. [3]\n\nAlmost three quarters - 72 per cent - of those patients were treated within the recommended timeframe for their triage category. [3]\n\nMr Chalmer\u2019s claim relies on statistics from the report showing 64 per cent - just under two thirds - of patients triaged in the urgent category were not seen on time, ie within 30 minutes. [3]\n\nUrgent was the worst performing of the five categories and is not a true indication of on-time treatment across all five triage categories.\n\nAccording to the report 100 per cent of resuscitation cases were treated on time. For the other categories, 76 per cent of emergency patients were treated on time, 64 per cent of urgent patients, 73 per cent of semi-urgent cases and 92 per cent of non-urgent presentations.\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes Mr Chalmer\u2019s claim that one-third of patients presenting to emergency are waiting for treatment for longer than is recommended is false.", "lang": "en"}
