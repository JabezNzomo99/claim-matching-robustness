However, the claim is false; the author of the report admitted it was incorrect and Nigerian authorities have dismissed the claim.\n\nThe article has been shared more than 1,000 times on Facebook since it was published on a website called MySchoolNews.com.ng on June 3, 2020, according to data provided by social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.\n\nThe article claims that the Secretary to the Government of the Federation of Nigeria, who doubles as the Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, made the disclosure while briefing journalists in the capital Abuja. However, it does not quote him directly.\n\nSimilar versions of the claim surfaced online hours after MySchoolNews\u2019 publication, including here and here, as well as on Jamyco, a website previously the subject of a debunk by AFP Fact Check.\n\nMySchoolNews published another article on June 4, 2020, reporting on a statement purportedly released by the education ministry saying that universities and polytechnics would reopen on July 20, 2020 -- a week later than schools.\n\nBoth claims are false. No major Nigerian media reported on the purported resumption because Mustapha did not make such a statement, and neither was there any evidence to support the claim.\n\nShortly after MySchoolNews published the second article, it added a disclaimer, describing the press release it based the follow-up story on as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe wish to inform students and the general public to discard it (the education ministry press release, editor\u2019s note), it is fake news emanating from a group of individuals try to cause panic on schools resumption date in Nigeria (sic),\u201d it reads. \u201cWe urge you all to exercise patience while the Federal government is doing the needful to ensure a good learning environment for students across the country.\u201d\n\nMySchoolNews clarified that Mustapha said the federal government would reopen schools \u201cfollowing the easing of the lockdown and reopening of worship centres, markets and business\u201d and \u201cwhen the safety of the school children could be guaranteed\u201d.\n\nNigerian education authorities denied the claims and said no decision had been made to reopen schools. The education ministry warned against \u201cunconfirmed news\u201d in statements posted to its official social media accounts.\n\n\u201cKindly disregard all unconfirmed news not originating from the Ministry's Official Media Handles,\u201d the ministry said on Facebook and Twitter on June 4, 2020. \u201cThe Official date for Resumption of Schools Nationwide is yet to be confirmed.\u201d\n\nSchools in Nigeria have been closed since March 2020, with Health Minister Osagie Ehanire saying the government was still working to \u201cjudge when it is safe\u201d to resume classes.\n\nHowever, Africa\u2019s most populous country eased restrictions on religious gathering on June 1, 2020, for an initial period of four weeks in line with many of its west African neighbours.", "lang": "en"}
