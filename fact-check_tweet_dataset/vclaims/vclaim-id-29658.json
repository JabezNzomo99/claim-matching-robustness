The letter asks people to avoid posting political posts on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram. In fact, no such letter has been issued by the government. The letter was actually issued by an NGO which was later retracted.\n\nThe letter issued by \u2018Crime Prevention Council of India\u2019 reads, \u201cDo not share election-related posts, photographs and posters\u201d. \u201cNo person should share political posts via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp and Other Networks associated with social media as part of election campaign during the upcoming election, 2019!\u201d\n\nIn the end the letter says \u201cThe District level Special Surveillance Team will take action against anybody found guilty.\u201d\n\nMany social media users have shared this information.\n\nIn order to start our investigation, we first checked the website of \u2018Crime Prevention Council of India (CPCI)\u2019 \u2013 www.cpcindiaonline.com. \n\nWhile the name of the organisation might allude that it is a government entity, it actually is otherwise. There we found phone number and we called the office to know about the \u2018Crime Prevention Council of India\u2019 and we were told that the Crime Prevention Council of India is a non-governmental organization. A CPCI staff told us that \u201cCPCI is an NGO that works to reduce crime in the country through awareness programs, workshops, seminars, etc.\u201d\n\nHe told us further that \u201cThe letter viral on social media was wrongly issued by a member of CPCI and not the organisation. He should not have issued the letter as a \u2018notice\u2019 but only as a suggestion in public interest. The concerned person \u2013 District Officer Narendra Singh \u2013 has now been terminated from his position and is not associated with the organisation any more,\u201d\n\n\u201cA letter has also been issued by CPCI in this matter and it has been clarified that the earlier \u2018information\u2019 was not issued by the organization. It is also mentioned in this letter that the Crime Prevention Council of India is a non-governmental organization.\u201d\n\nWe talked to an Election Commission official for more information and we were told that there is no directive to take any action against general public for sharing any post. The EC has issued guidelines only for the candidates and political parties.\n\nConclusion: In our investigation, we found that the government has not issued any letter asking the general public to avoid sharing political posts ahead of 2019 Loksabha elections. The viral letter was erroneously released by an NGO official.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right. If you have a doubt on any news that could impact you, society or the nation, let us know.
