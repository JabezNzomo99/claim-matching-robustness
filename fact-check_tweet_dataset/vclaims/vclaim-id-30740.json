The claim is false; the video was circulating online at least one day before the court\u2019s judgement.\n\nThe video was published on Twitter here on January 14, 2020, by Fred Diaries, an account with more than 24,000 followers. The tweet containing the clip has been shared more than 300 times and liked nearly 200 times.\n\nThe post claims: \u201cMbaise people going to protest on behalf of Emeka Ihedioha Then boom they hear Gunshots [sic].\" Mbaise is a town in southeastern Nigeria in Imo state.\n\nThe footage, which shows a crowd quickly dispersing at what sounds like gunshots, also appeared here and here on Facebook, here on Twitter and here on Instagram alongside similar claims that it was related to the court ruling about the state governor. (Some of the Facebook posts here, here and here show screen recordings of the video tweeted by Fred Diaries.)\n\nMbaise-born Emeka Ihedioha of Nigeria\u2019s main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) was elected governor of Imo eight months ago. But after his rival Hope Uzodinma of the ruling All Progressives Congress challenged Ihedioha\u2019s victory, the Supreme Court decided in his favour on January 14, 2020.\n\nThe ruling has been criticised on the basis that Uzodinma had initially finished fourth in the March 9, 2019, gubernatorial poll, before the Supreme Court ruled that he actually finished first.\n\nA common feature in all the posts is a watermark of the name \"GlitchCam\" in the bottom-right corner of the video. GlitchCam, called \u201cVideo Editor - Glitch Video Effects\u201d here and \u201cGlitch Video Effect - Video Editor & Video Effects for Android\u201d here, is an application developed by Inshot Inc for editing images and videos. It claims to help users \u201cdistort video in an artistic way\u201d.\n\nThe 15-second clip shows a loud crowd approaching a junction. The crowd then quickly disperses while what sounds like gunfire is heard. Down the road, a white-coloured armoured vehicle approaches the crowd.\n\nSome of the comments on social media posts express shock at the speed the people ran away in the video clip.\n\n\n\nThe GlitchCam application has five features, including a speed effect that can make videos play twice as fast or reduce speed by half.\n\n\n\n The claim that the video shows Mbaise residents gathering to protest the court\u2019s ruling is false: While the PDP did stage protests against the judgment in Abuja and London, the video was first posted on Twitter here on January 13 -- a day before Nigeria\u2019s highest court nullified Ihedioha\u2019s electoral victory.\n\nThis tweet makes no mention of where the incident took place nor does it mention Ihedioha; it simply makes fun of the scene. In the comments, many people joke about how fast the crowd disperses.\n\nThe next day, it was reposted by Fred Diaries.\n\n\"I saw the video on one of my friends\u2019 WhatsApp statuses, so I saved it through an app \u2018WhatsApp status saver\u2019 and posted it here (Twitter). That's all I know,\" said Muhammad Aminu, the owner of the Twitter account @iamdihealer.\n\nAFP has not yet been able to independently verify the source of the video. We spoke to Mbaise residents who did not recognise the location as being in their town.\n\nImo police spokesman Orlando Ikeokwu said the video clip was not shot in any part of the state.\n\n\u201cThis is not even in Imo state, nothing like this happened anywhere in Imo State,\u201d Ikeokwu said.\n\nIf you have any information regarding the source of this video, please contact us.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate Facebook post shared more than a hundred times claims to show that Nigerian troops in Mbaise were responsible for killing protesters. We\u2019ve archived the post, which features two images, here.\n\nHowever, multiple reverse image searches on Google and Tineye show both images were in fact taken in Malawi.\n\nThe photo above was first posted here and here by Malawian newspaper The Nation. It was shot by Ras Peter Kansengwa during a Human Rights Defenders Coalition demonstration in the capital Lilongwe, but Kansengwa\u2019s logo in the bottom-right corner of the image was cropped out in the Facebook post that falsely claimed it was taken in Nigeria.\n\nThe second photo from the Facebook post appeared alongside other pictures in Twitter posts (see red arrow above) about the Malawi protest, shared here and here.", "lang": "en"}
