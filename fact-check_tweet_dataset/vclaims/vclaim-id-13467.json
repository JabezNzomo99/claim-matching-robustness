(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post shows two images in a split screen. On the left, it looks like the president is kissing his wife on the lips with a closed mouth. On the right, it looks like he\u2019s kissing his daughter on the lips with an open mouth.\n\nHere are two versions of the second photo with wider crops. You can see Trump is grasping Ivanka\u2019s upper arm and they\u2019re standing in front of several American flags. It\u2019s the stage of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in July of that year. In the Facebook post, both Trumps appear to be wearing the outfits they wore when Ivanka Trump gave a speech at the convention introducing her dad, then only a presidential candidate.\n\nBut we found no evidence that a kiss like the one shown in the post happened. Millions of people were also watching that moment live, and while some objected to Donald and Ivanka Trump\u2019s embrace, there was no mention of an open-mouthed kiss on the lips.\n\nReviewing Getty Images photos from that day, we found shots like this one, where Trump is clutching his daughter\u2019s arm, and this one and this one and this one, where they are kissing on the cheek. We found none in eight pages of photos that shows them embracing the way the Facebook post appears.\n\nSearching for the image in the post elsewhere online, we couldn\u2019t find an original, credible source.\n\nAnd watching the end of Ivanka Trump\u2019s speech introducing her father, he comes onto the stage, they kiss each other on both cheeks and then she leaves the stage. He does not kiss her the way the Facebook post makes it appear.\n\nYou can watch the moment from a different angle in a clip accompanying this story from Time, which at the time reported on how Trump had \"once again creeped out the Internet, this time with a \u2018so inappropriate\u2019 embrace of his daughter Ivanka.\"\n\nBut the criticism wasn\u2019t about a kiss. Rather, some people objected to the way he touched his daughter\u2019s hips.", "lang": "en"}
