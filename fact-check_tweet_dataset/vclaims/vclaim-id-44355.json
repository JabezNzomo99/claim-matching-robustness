Gates and his wife have previously donated to the research institute through their foundation.\n\nOn Jan. 29, the website Big League Politics published an article, titled \u201cHMM: Coronavirus Patent is Owned by Vaccine-Production Institute Funded by Bill Gates,\u201d claiming the Pirbright Institute owns the patent for the new coronavirus. It also mentions a debunked conspiracy theory that a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation training simulation predicted the outbreak before it began.\n\nAn Instagram user screen grabbed that article and posted it on the social media site, with the caption saying, \u201cThings that make you go hmm yes that\u2019s right Bill Gates owns the patent for the vaccine against the Virus.\u201d\n\nPirbright\u2019s patent is not related to the new coronavirus that has sickened thousands of people in China, contrary to the post\u2019s claim.

It also covers a porcine delta-coronavirus that infects pigs. Both are part of the coronavirus family but distinct from the 2019-nCoV virus.\n\nPirbright confirmed in a statement to The Associated Press that the patent is not for the new coronavirus and that the research institute does not currently work with human coronaviruses.\n\nThe U.K.-based Pirbright Institute receives some funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In November 2019, their foundation awarded Pirbright a $5.5 million grant to establish its Livestock Antibody Hub, according to the Pirbright website.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency Jan. 30, reported The New York Times.", "lang": "en"}
