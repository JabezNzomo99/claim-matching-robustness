Ted Cruz, R-Texas, hasn\u2019t shied away from the spotlight.\n\nOn Nov. 8, 2013, . Long before he got to the obligatory joke about reading Green Eggs & Ham during a lengthy Senate speech, he addressed gun policy.\n\n\"Do you target violent criminals, or do you try to take away the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens?\" Cruz said.\n\nAfter the senator criticized Obama for focusing on the latter at the expense of the former, he praised predecessor George W. Bush\u2019s efforts.\n\n\"Under President Bush, prosecution of gun crimes was 30 percent higher than it is under President Obama,\" Cruz said. \"They\u2019re not targeting bad guys.\"\n\nWe decided to see how the numbers differed under the two presidents.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the number of federal prosecutions by year. We\u2019ll start with fiscal year 2002, since that represents Bush\u2019s first full year in office. Fiscal year 2012 is the most recent year we have data for.\n\nThere are two different sets of statistics we can look at. Cruz\u2019s spokeswoman referred us to the Transitional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University data-gathering organization. This data tracks federal gun prosecutions by the lead, or most serious, charge.\n\nOn the other hand, the Department of Justice\u2019s United States Attorney\u2019s Office tracks all charges, a more inclusive category of prosecutions. Their data set includes everyone who was charged with a gun crime. The lead charge category only includes people whose most serious offense was gun-related, a distinction that omits thousands of charges each year.\n\nCruz\u2019s spokeswoman also told us that Cruz\u2019s claim didn\u2019t take into account numbers for Bush\u2019s entire term: He used 2004, the high-water mark for lead gun prosecutions during the time period, as his starting point.\n\nWe\u2019re left with four ways to calculate the percent change:\n\u2022 Lead charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 2.2 percent decrease\n\u2022 Lead charges from 2004 to 2012, which gives us a 29.4 percent decrease\n\u2022 All charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 10.3 percent increase\n\u2022 All charges from 2005 (the high-water mark of this data set) to 2012, which gives us a 10.2 percent decrease\n\nThis makes clear how Cruz got his 30 percent decrease. However, that\u2019s not the only, or necessarily the best, approach.\n\nNone other than TRAC\u2019s co-director, Susan Long, told PolitiFact that her organization\u2019s use of lead charges isn\u2019t as comprehensive as using all charges. She also called Cruz\u2019s 2004 start date misleading, since it amounts to cherry-picking.\n\nThe most reliable number may be the 10.3 percent increase in gun prosecutions between fiscal years 2002 and 2012. This rate actually indicates the trend moving in the opposite direction from what Cruz asserted.\n\nIn addition to highlighting a numerical difference in federal gun crime prosecutions, Cruz specifically suggested that Obama\u2019s policies are responsible for the decrease. But how much influence does the president really have on the issue?\n\nExperts say: not much.\n\n\"The Bush administration was all over the map,\" Long said. \"Those trends really are being driven by something other than presidential policy,\" since the peaks and valleys don\u2019t coincide with presidential terms, she said.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted in a previous fact check, the president, as the head of the executive branch, can order changes to prosecutorial priorities. For instance, following the Newtown, Conn. school shooting in December 2012, Obama did call for the need to \"maximize enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and prosecute gun crime.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t yet have data that reflects prosecutions in the aftermath of Newtown. But it\u2019s important to note that Obama\u2019s priorities are not the only factors at play in these decisions. Any presidential shift in policy must filter down to the attorney general, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field offices, and front-line attorneys, said Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the Regional Justice Information Service.\n\nU.S. attorneys can decline to prosecute gun cases for a variety of reasons, as outlined by TRAC.\n\nSo Obama is responsible for setting the broad policy approach to gun prosecutions, but he isn\u2019t micromanaging individual cases. Much of the decision-making occurs at a lower level.\n\nCruz said prosecution of gun crimes under the Bush administration was 30 percent higher than it is under Obama.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to get a decline that big by cherry-picking the data, but the most inclusive method actually produces an increase. Cruz also overstates the role of the president in determining prosecution rates. We rate Cruz\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
