It is not a list of places declared as \u201chotspots\u201d for coronavirus infections in Ghana.\n\nA list of \u201ccoronavirus hotspot areas\u2019 in Ghana is circulating on social media, specifically on WhatsApp. The list names areas like Agbogbloshie, Tema Community One, Nungua market, Agbogba area and Nima market among many others as places with the highest coronavirus infection rates in the country.\n\nDubawa spoke to Mr Jacob Andoh, Public Relations Officer at Ghana Health Service (GHS). According to Mr Andoh, the list is FAKE.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t come from GHS and we do not know where it came from. Everything we want the public to know is on the website. If it is not on the website, then it is not from us\u201d, Mr Andoh said.\n\nHe also forwarded to us the image below.\n\nThe Director-General of the GHS, Dr Patrick Aboagye, had mentioned some districts as hotspots during the COVID-19 bi-weekly briefings on Tuesday. He, however, did not name specific areas in the districts.\n\nFurther checks on the GHS website reveal no such list.\n\nThe Ministry of Information has also not announced or published any such list on their social media channels or website.\n\nThe Ghana Health Service or the Ministry of Information has not released any list indicating areas in Ghana that have been declared as coronavirus infection hotspots.\n\nRoselena Ahiable is a Senior Researcher with Dubawa Ghana.
