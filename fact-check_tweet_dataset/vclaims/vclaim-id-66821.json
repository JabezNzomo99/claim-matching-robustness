John McCain, R-Ariz., has a few pointers for Chuck Todd, who takes the helm of NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sept. 7.\n\nOn Aug. 27, McCain appeared on MSNBC\u2019s the Daily Rundown as part of Todd\u2019s weeklong send-off.\n\n\"I called to congratulate you and as the person who has the most appearances on Meet the Press, I\u2019d be glad to give you a lot of advice and counseling, including the best gotcha questions of the week,\" McCain said. \"And I have one other suggestion, we should change the name from Meet the Press to Meet the World\u2019s Foremost Political Junkie, And Guests. How \u2018bout that?\"\n\n\"69 times,\" Todd quantified. He then rolled a montage of McCain on the show, including a 2008 interview with Tim Russert, who said that Republican Bob Dole had clocked the most appearances but \"there\u2019s still time for (McCain) to catch up.\"\n\nWe wondered, has McCain caught up, meeting the press more times than any other guest?\n\nWe reached out to McCain\u2019s office and a spokesperson told us they don\u2019t keep track of those numbers but said McCain surpassed Dole in 2012.\n\nMeet the Press\u2019 fact , which needs an update, still lists Dole as the most frequent guest, with 63 appearances. McCain is next with 53 appearances, and Vice President Joe Biden trails McCain by 10 appearances.\n\nMcCain\u2019s 54th appearance came on March 29, 2009, to recently host David Gregory. Dole still had the record among guests, but Gregory had encouraging words for McCain.\n\n\"We've been doing the calculations here. We think we can make this up, maybe within a year's time,\" he said.\n\nThree years later, McCain broke Dole\u2019s record on , his 64th appearance.\n\n\"You've been on this show more than I have,\" Gregory joked.\n\nBased on Meet the Press , McCain appeared on the show twice more in 2012. He hasn\u2019t made an appearance this year, but went on three times in 2013, which brings his grand total to 69, according to our count.\n\nFor the record, McCain has appeared on the Sunday shows 11 times so far in 2014, but not on Meet the Press.\n\nIt's worth noting that NBC and McCain are using a slightly non-traditional definition of guest. Namely, it excludes journalists who appear on the show to debate the week's big stories. Again, according to NBC's out-dated fact page, the Washington Post\u2019s David Broder clocked 401 Meet appearances, while Chicago Sun Times\u2019 Robert Novak appeared on the show 248 times. Novak and Broder are both deceased.\n\nMcCain said that he\u2019s \"the person who has the most appearances on Meet the Press.\"\n\nTechnically, multiple people who represent the press side of the meet have McCain beat. Of officeholders, we count McCain as the current leader -- with 69 appearances.\n\nWith that caveat, we rate McCain\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
