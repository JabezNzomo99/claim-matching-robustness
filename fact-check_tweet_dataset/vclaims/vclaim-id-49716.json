The warning alert looked like this:\n\nThe warning alert makes several assertions: that video footage detailing Argentina\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic was going to start circulating online; that that video file would irreparably compromise information on viewers cell phones in 10 seconds, and that the national news outlet, CNN, had reported on the malware scheme and/or the video about Argentina.\n\nBy July 16, cautionary messages about the alleged file were spreading on Twitter, as well. Numerous Snopes readers requested that we investigate the warning alert and purported video.\n\nThe warning \u2014 like similarly-worded messages that have circulated on WhatsApp in recent years \u2014 appeared to be a hoax.\n\nFirst, we looked for evidence of the alleged video about the South American country\u2019s response to the pandemic, and whether that footage had been spreading a virus that hacks people\u2019s phones.\n\nMeanwhile, we contacted CNN to determine the legitimacy of the claim that the news outlet had reported on the scheme, or the \u201cArgentina is doing it\u201d video. Blair Cofield, a CNN spokesperson, said in an email to Snopes: \u201cThis is false. There is nothing on CNN platforms with that message.\u201d\n\nIn sum, it appeared that no one online actually saw or received a link to the \u201cArgentina is doing it\u201d video, per our analysis.\n\nAdditionally, we searched for details to explain the extent to which the scheme removed or stole recipients\u2019 cell information, and the underlying motivation behind the warning message. We found no evidence to explain the cell operating system on which the malware runs.\n\nOn a web page to explain the platform\u2019s privacy and security issues, WhatsApp says such messages that aim to deceive users often contain instructions to forward the message (\u201cPass the information on to your family and friends\u201d) and claim you can avoid punishment (getting your phone hacked) if you act in a certain way. The \u201cArgentina is doing it\u201d message checked both those boxes.\n\nThe WhatsApp page goes on to say people should disregard such messages, and \u201cto avoid exposing your contacts to potential harm, please never forward these messages to them.\u201d A cybersecurity writer for Forbes wrote in March 2020:\n\n\u201cThese hoax WhatsApp messages are the modern equivalent of the old chain letter that urged the reader to send copies on to ten people, or something terrible would happen to them. \u2026 the real problem with this kind of hoax messaging that goes viral is that it can then turn into what it purports to be: a malware distribution tool.\u201d\n\nGiven the fact that no evidence shows that the \u201cArgentina is doing it\u201d video exists, nor that it is part of a malware scheme to hack cell phones \u2014 as well as the similarities in language between this viral message and previous WhatsApp hoaxes \u2014 we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
