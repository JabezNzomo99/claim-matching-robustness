John Kitzhaber has been considering whether he\u2019ll call the Oregon Legislature back for a special session to look at further cuts to government pensions, some lawmakers are making their opinions known.\n\nRep. Sal Esquivel, a Medford Republican, thinks a special session is a bad idea and wrote an opinion piece about it, which appeared in The Mail Tribune, a paper in southern Oregon.\n\n\"This sounds like a good idea and an admirable goal on the surface, but it also raises any number of questions,\" he wrote. \"The most important is obvious \u2014 why wasn\u2019t this done during the five-month legislative session that we just adjourned?\"\n\nEsquivel lists a number of arguments, but one caught our attention straight away: \"Every day of a legislative session costs Oregon taxpayers $40,000. That includes paying staff, as well as per diem for legislators. And given the governor\u2019s historically poor track record when it comes to special sessions, that is probably not the best use of our limited resources.\"\n\nWe vaguely remembered the last special session, when lawmakers convened to give Nike a tax break, but we didn\u2019t remember the bill being so high, so we decided to check it out.\n\nFirst we looked through some of The Oregonian\u2019s articles about the late 2012 special session to see what we\u2019d reported as the cost as then. According to politics reporter Christian Gaston, the per-day cost (and it only lasted a day) of that session was $13,000.\n\nThat\u2019s a long way from what Esquivel quoted. We shot Esquivel a quick email to see if he could point us toward his sources. The price, he said through a staffer, had come from the \"Legislative Finance Office.\"\n\nWe checked in with Sandra Rierson, the manager of the Financial Services department, who explained that the price depends on the kind of session you\u2019re talking about.\n\nThe cost per day of the longer regular sessions comes in at $34,901 a day but a special session is considerably less expensive at $13,000.\n\nBoth numbers do not include the basic costs of keeping the Capitol running, which would get spent with or without lawmakers in the building. So why the difference?\n\nGiven the short time frame of a special session, there aren\u2019t nearly as many hires. \"We try to use existing staff as much as possible,\" Rierson said.\n\nWe called Esquivel to get his response. He said he based the statement on numbers he\u2019d been given years ago. \"I was told in the past by LFO that it was $36,000 per day and that was (six) years ago. I am assuming that that number did in fact go up so I concluded $40,000.\"\n\nThe figure we received, however, was the most recent average-per-day cost available from the finance department so we\u2019re sticking with it.\n\nIn an opinion piece arguing against a possible special legislative session, Esquivel said a legislative session costs $40,000 a day. In fact, it\u2019s closer to $35,000, and that\u2019s for regular legislative sessions. Esquivel, however, was making the argument against a special session. The cost per day for that comes in at a much lower $13,000.\n\nBecause his opinion piece addresses special sessions in particular, there is no truth to his statement -- not to mention the fact that he didn\u2019t use current numbers for regular sessions.", "lang": "en"}
