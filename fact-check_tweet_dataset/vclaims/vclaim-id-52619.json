Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of women jumping from a building after being locked by the Police for shopping during the lockdown. Fact: It is an old video. The video was taken in Karachi (Pakistan) and it is not related to the current lockdown. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched with the relevant keywords, a post by a Pakistani news agency \u2018Karachi Today\u2019 with the same video was found in the search results. In the post, \u2018Karachi Today\u2019 has mentioned that it is an old video that was taken at Khadda Market, Karachi.\n\n\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same video was found to be upload on YouTube and Facebook in 2015 with the title: \u2018Sex workers fleeing after FIA raid at a brothel in Karachi\u2019. So, it can be concluded that it is an old video.\n\nWhen searched on Google Maps with the shop names seen in the video, the location in the video can be found in the Khadda Market (Karachi).\n\nTo sum it up, an old Pakistan video falsely shared as \u2018Women locked up by Police for shopping during the lockdown\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
