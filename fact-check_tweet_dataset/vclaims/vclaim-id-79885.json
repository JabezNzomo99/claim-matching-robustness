The video has been overlaid with a voiceover which states that a particular kind of machine produces these chemically laden adulterated cashew nuts which are harmful for the health.\n\nThe 42 second long video shows unbaked cashew-shaped biscuits being separated from a sheet of rolled dough with the help of stencils.\n\nThe viral video is circulating on Facebook with the caption: ''Friends, fake cashews are also made in the factory and they are coming in the market. Be careful.''

The archived version of the tweet can be seen here.\n\nClick here for an archive of the video.\n\nWe also received the video in our tipline number with the claim that a chemical cashew making machine manufactured in China is being widely used in India.\n\nSeveral netizens pointed out that the video is of a 'kaju nimki' producing machine. The Kaju Nimki is a popular Indian bite sized biscuit, available in the shape of a cashew nut.\n\nTaking cue, BOOM ran a keyword search on Youtube with 'kaju nimki machine' and found several videos which show cashew-shaped biscuits made using the same process as shown in the viral video. \n\n\n\nWe found one Tushar Pandya, a Mumbai-based enterprenuer who owns several of these snack producing machines. Pandya identifies himself as a manufacturer of food processing machinery on Twitter. His account has other such videos of manufacturing food products with similar machines.\n\nIn a telephonic conversation with BOOM, Pandya said, \"The video is fake and you cannot make cashews in machines artificially. It clearly shows kaju nimki biscuits made out of flour.'' He identified the machine showed in the video as an automatic 'kaju nimki' making machine similar to the one used in his factory. He also added, ''You mix water and flour and blend the dough into that shape, to cut out cashew nut shaped biscuits. They are then baked or roasted.''\n\nBOOM found similar videos on Youtube of cashew and other shaped snacks being manufactured with such automatic snack-making machines.\n\n\n\nAlso read: Kerala Yoga Ashram Photo Viral As 'Bharatiya' Culture In New Zealand\n\nBOOM however could not independently verify the origin of the video.", "lang": "en"}
