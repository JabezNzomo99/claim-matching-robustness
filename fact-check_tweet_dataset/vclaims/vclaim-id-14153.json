The featured photo was not taken in California, it is not from an Earth Day event (which isn\u2019t until April 22), and it is not proof of hypocrisy on the part of environmentalists, as the text suggests.\n\nThe photo actually shows the aftermath of a football tailgate from nearly a decade ago at the University of Georgia.\n\nUsing reverse image searches, we found the same image used in posts about the September 2009 game. A local radio station\u2019s 2011 story about tailgating policies at the university uses the same photo, credited to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, with a caption noting that it was \u201cin front of the University of Georgia Law Library one Sunday morning in September 2009, the aftermath of tailgating activities during a football game the night before.\u201d\n\nThe Journal-Constitution, citing university officials, reported days after the Sept. 12, 2009, home opener against South Carolina that clean-up crews collected about 70 tons of trash.\n\nSimilar images of the littered area can be seen on the photo-hosting website Flickr in an album belonging to Sharon Bradley, special collections librarian at the university\u2019s School of Law.\n\nBradley confirmed in a phone interview with FactCheck.org that the image in the meme shows the same scene as her photos of a tailgate\u2019s remnants in a quad outside the law school.\n\nThe photo in the meme shows the view from \u201cthe steps of the main library,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cIt certainly is not California.\u201d\n\nBradley said trash from football tailgates was an ongoing issue at the time, until changes at the university led to improvements.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nBradley, Sharon. Special collections librarian, University of Georgia School of Law.
