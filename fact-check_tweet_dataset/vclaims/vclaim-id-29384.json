No, neither is true: While racial definitions in the United States are controversial, the federal government's definition of \"Black or African American\" includes persons \"having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa... and Afro-Caribbean entries, such as Haitian and Jamaican,\" according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The California senator falls into the legal definition of \"American Black,\" despite attacks from political opponents who accuse the Democratic presidential contender of stealing the heritage of families with longer histories in the country. Also, the Berkeley school district confirmed her elementary school was segregated until a year before Harris started kindergarten, contrary to claims it was integrated six years earlier.\n\nQuestions of Sen. Harris's racial identity have followed her throughout her political career, but they grew louder in the wake of her strong performance in her first presidential debate appearance in which chided former Vice President Joe Biden's record on forced school busing in the 1970s. President Trump's eldest son retweeted a tweet (archived here) posted on June 27, 2019 that read:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nDonald J. Trump Jr., the oldest of President Trump's children, retweeted it with the added message \"Is this true? Wow.\" This helped propel Ali Alexander's tweet into viral status and also assured major media attention to the controversy. Trump Jr. deleted his retweet, but here is a screenshot:\n\nAlexander, who the New York Times described as \"a right-wing personality,\" defined himself as \"half-Arab, half-American Black\" in a follow-up video titled \"MY TWEET WENT VIRAL: Explaining why Kamala Harris is not American Black.\"\n\n\"Kamala Harris's family didn't suffer American segregation,\" Alexander said, saying she \"spent most of her formative years in Canada in an Indian household.\"\n\n\"I'm calling her out because she stole debate time claiming that her family suffered Jim Crow and civil rights discrimination in America, when that's not the case,\" Alexander said in his video.\n\nHarris did not specifically claim \"Jim Crow\" suffering by her ancestors, but she did make a personal claim of discrimination as a child.\n\n\"As the only black person on this stage, I would like to speak on the issue of race,\" Harris said in what many saw as her break-out moment in the debate. She then recalled a story about neighbors who wouldn't let their children play with Harris and her sister \"because we were black.\" She then questioned Biden's record on race, specifically his cooperation with southern senators to \"oppose busing\" in the 1970s. \"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.\"\n\nHarris was born in Oakland, California, in 1964. She lived with her mother, a cancer researcher born in India, after her Jamaican-born father, a university professor, moved out following a divorce when Kamala was seven. Her mother moved her to Montreal, Canada, during her high school years, but she then returned to the United States where she attended Howard University, a historically black college.\n\n\"Kamala Harris's father's family owned slaves,\" Alexander said, suggesting this disqualified her from claiming to be a Black American.\n\nMy roots go back, within my lifetime, to my paternal grandmother Miss Chrishy (n\u00e9e Christiana Brown, descendant of Hamilton Brown who is on record as plantation and slave owner and founder of Brown's Town) and to my maternal grandmother Miss Iris (n\u00e9e Iris Finegan, farmer and educator, from Aenon Town and Inverness, ancestry unknown to me). The Harris name comes from my paternal grandfather Joseph Alexander Harris, land-owner and agricultural 'produce' exporter (mostly pimento or all-spice), who died in 1939 one year after I was born and is buried in the church yard of the magnificent Anglican Church which Hamilton Brown built in Brown's Town (and where, as a child, I learned the catechism, was baptized and confirmed, and served as an acolyte).\n\nThis is a photo of Kamala Harris's paternal great-grandmother Miss Chrishy, published in Donald Harris's article.\n\nThis is a photo of great-grandmother Miss Iris, holding young Kamala in her lap in 1966.\n\nHaving a white slave owner as a great-great-great-great-great grandfather does not rule Kamala Harris out as being African American. Instead, it gives her commonality with a large percentage of African Americans.\n\nHarris responded to critics in a radio interview in February, 2019:\n\nI think they don't understand who black people are, because if you do, if you walked on Hampton's campus, or Howard's campus, or Morehouse or Spelman or Fisk, you would have a much better appreciation for the diaspora, for the diversity, for the beauty in the diversity of who we are as black people... I am black and I am proud of it. I was born black and I'll die black and I am proud of it. And I am not gonna make any excuses for it, for anybody, because they don't understand.\n\nSen. Harris shared a photo of her as a young child with her mother and sister on Instagram in February 2020:\n\nThey post was accompanied with this message:\n\nOther false claims about Kamala Harris that Lead Stories has debunk include:\n\nFact Check: Kamala Harris' Birth Certificate Does NOT Identify Her As 'Caucasian'\n\nFact Check: Senator Kamala Harris IS A United States Citizen And IS Eligible To Be President\n\nFact Check: Kamala Harris Did NOT Say She Listened To Snoop And Tupac In College\n\nFact Check: Kamala Harris Did NOT Call Joe Biden 'A Racist And A Rapist'\n\nFact Check: Photo Is NOT Kamala Harris With Her Parents And Is NOT Evidence She Is Not A Black American\n\nFact Check: Kamala Harris Said She Believed Women Who Said They Felt 'Uncomfortable' By Biden Touching -- NOT 'Rape Accusers'\n\nFact Check: Kamala Harris Descended From A Slave Owner, But It's Not 'An Inconvenient Part Of Her History' Or A 'Deep, Dark Secret' That 'Could Come Back To Haunt Her'", "lang": "en"}
