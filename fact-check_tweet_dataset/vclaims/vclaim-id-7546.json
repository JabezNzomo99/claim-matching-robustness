No, that's not true, the story came from a satirical website that was spoofing recent sexual harrasment allegations made against Morgan Freeman. Most of what Sins was alleged to have done did indeed happen but it was all consensual because the man is a porn actor.\n\nThe story came from an article published by 8Shit on May 24, 2018 titled \"Johnny Sins Accused Of Sexual Harassment By 8 Women\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nJohnny Sins, an actor, engineer, doctor, astronaut, karate master, pizza deliver guy, plumber, dentist, school teacher, business man, scientist, soldier, firefighter, detective, cop, wrestler, football coach, and many other professions, has been acc*sed of disrespectful conduct towards women. One of the biggest contributors to society, who has helped many woman throughout his entire life, has been acc*sed by 8 of them, who claim that he \"forcefully kissed them\" and \"spanked them\" without the required consent. According to CNN, the women allege that it happened during one of the films (Sins is also an actor). \"He was giving me a penetrating look, and 5 minutes later, it was a penetrating penis.\", said one the women, who decided to remain anonymous. \"He spanked me. I told him to stop but he wouldn't stop. I was screaming but no one could hear me. It was all planned like in a movie.\" said another woman.\n\nWe were unable to locate any reports on the website of CNN even mentioning Johnny Sins. The actor has hundreds of porn videos to his credit on his IMDB profile:\n\nThe story spoofs the recent media reports about Morgan Freeman, another popular actor, being accused of inappropriate behaviour towards women:\n\nFurthermore, 8shit.net carries a disclaimer on its about page that reads:\n\nAnd an additional disclaimer in the footer of every page:\n\n8Shit is a satire news and humor website.
