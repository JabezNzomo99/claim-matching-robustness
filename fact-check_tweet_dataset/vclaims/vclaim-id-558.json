The \u201cM\u201d is made of 3 Hebrew symbols for the number 6 \u2013 so 666. There is a cross in the \u201cO\u201d \u2013 that is \u201cwitchcraft\u201d bc when you tip the can it\u2019s an upside down cross. It mentions \u201cMILF\u2019s\u201d like the drink so you will too \u2013 hence the can is not christian as the cross suggests at first site.\n\nThe clip displayed above featured a very sincere woman who laid out the Monster 666 theory in-depth, and her claims rested on a number of assumptions, including the assumptions that Satan worshippers are numerous, have infiltrated large corporations for unknown reasons, and seek to use their wealth and power to pointlessly infuse benign daily objects with coded signals. Another crucial assumption was most Americans don\u2019t know enough about how Hebrew works to understand it doesn\u2019t quite translate to what the woman in the video suggests:\n\nLook at the \u2018M\u2019 closely, there\u2019s a gap right here in the letter, it\u2019s never connected. So you go to Hebrew. The letter Vav is also the number six \u2014 you could have here, in Hebrew, 666. But my interest is the word Monster, what do you see in the O? There\u2019s a cross. What has Christ got to do with an energy drink?\n\nThe matter of the cross is \u201csolved\u201d by the video\u2019s narrator, who believes the symbol she identifies as Christian is turned upside down with each sip of the drink, invoking the common idea that adherents of Satan employ subverted Christian icons. The woman never fully articulates what the end game of secret Satanic symbols on Monster energy drink cans might be, but she concludes: \u201cYou see these Ms everywhere. Hats, t-shirts, bumper stickers. Is there another agenda here? If God can use people and product, so can Satan.\u201d\n\nThe rumors about 666s and other Satanic hidden symbols on Monster energy drinks have been circulating since at least 2009; however, the video has revived the old and long-debunked rumors with a vengeance.\n\nUltimately, the claim involving a 666 on Monster energy drink cans relies on the incorrect assumption the three claw marks comprising the logo represent three iterations of the Hebrew symbol \u201cVav,\u201d resulting in a Hebrew equivalent of \u201c666.\u201d But \u201c666\u201d in Hebrew would be written \u201cTav Resh Samech Vav,\u201d or \u201csix hundred sixty-six.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the clip, the woman points to a \u201ccross\u201d in the Monster logo, which is inverted when the can is tipped for drinking. However, the symbol to which the woman refers is phi, a pre-Christian Greek character that has nothing to do with Christianity, witchcraft, or Satanic messaging.", "lang": "en"}
