He is charged with one felony count of arson, Sgt. Spencer Crum told FactCheck.org.\n\n\u201cHe was charged with arson, but not for all the fires that have caused devastation over the last 10 days,\u201d Crum said.\n\nIt was a small fire that was put out within minutes by the local fire department, he said.\n\nGonzales, who was familiar to patrolling officers in the park where he was arrested, said that he had started the fire to keep warm, Sonoma County Sheriff Robert Giordano said during a press conference on Oct. 17. Gonzales had both a fire extinguisher and a lighter with him at the time, Giordano said.\n\nNo one has been arrested in relation to the fires that have burned 245,000 acres in northern California, Crum said.\n\nRumors that the Gonzales arrest was related to the deadly wildfires stem from a story that ran on the popular conservative website, Breitbart, which quoted selectively from a short article about the arrest from the local Santa Rosa newspaper, The Press Democrat.\n\nIt is true that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, issued a request that the sheriff\u2019s office detain Gonzales so that it could pursue deportation, as mentioned in the Breitbart story.\n\n\u201cICE lodged a detainer against Jesus Gonzalez [sic] with Sonoma County jail officials on October 16, following his arrest on felony charges for maliciously setting fire to a property,\u201d ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez said in an email to FactCheck.org.\n\nICE did not say that the arrest was related to the deadly wildfires, but it did say that it had sought to detain Gonzales four times in the last year.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
