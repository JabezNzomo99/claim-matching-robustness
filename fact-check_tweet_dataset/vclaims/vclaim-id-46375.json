It is being claimed that the same leopard that was spotted previously on May 14 was spotted again in NARM premises, Rajendranagar, Hyderabad.\n\nThe caption of the post reads: \u2018Peeping leopard. The leopard which showed up at Katedan Hyderabad on May 14 was caught on CCTV last night at the NAARM premises at Rajendranagar. The leopard was seen on the window of a room on the premises.\u2019\n\nCheck here for the archived post.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above picture and found that the claim attached to the picture is FAKE.\n\nWhen we put the picture through Reverse Image Search, we came across a collage on Facebook, which included the picture in question and was published on May 15, 2020. It was posted by Klaserie Camps, a camping facility in a privately-owned wildlife sanctuary in South Africa.\n\nWe found the same photos on their Instagram handle as well. The caption of the picture read, \u2018@natashakotzephotography A peeping Tom \u2026. literally! This young male, whom we\u2019ve known since a cub with his sister, is approximately 2 years old, came to visit Frikkie & Natasha at their home at Dundee last night. They do not have a pet, so we\u2019re curious as to his behaviour. What a sighting!\u2019\n\nWe further contacted the company and the spokesperson of the company confirmed that the picture was \u201cdefinitely taken in Nzumba Lodge, Klaserie Camps, from Klaserie Private Nature Reserve in the Greater Kruger National Park in South Africa\u201d.\n\nWe also found that the leopard spotted on a busy road at Mailardevpally in Rangareddy on May 14 was rescued by the forest department the same day.\n\nOur investigation clearly establishes the fact that the leopard was not seen in Hyderabad but in a private sanctuary in South Africa.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
