The post also claims that it might stop the Australian bushfires. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post \n\n\n\nFact: The video is an old one. While it is true that there were some rains in Australia recently, the video was taken in November-2019. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nOn searching about the rains in Australia, it was found that it rained in Australia on Monday (i.e. January 6, 2020). But when the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same video was found in an article published in November-2019. In the article, a link to the Facebook video uploaded by the \u2018Leongatha Fire Brigade\u2019 can be seen. So, the video is from Australia but it is not related to the recent rains.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video is being shared as firefighters celebrating the recent rains in Australia.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
