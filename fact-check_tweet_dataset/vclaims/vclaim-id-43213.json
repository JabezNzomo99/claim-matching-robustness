The images have since been shared hundreds of times.\n\n\n\nSince then, the stickers have provoked outrage for appearing to celebrate the deaths of coronavirus victims. The Twitter account behind the stickers XREastMidlands has been disowned by various other Extinction Rebellion groups, which say the messaging goes against the group\u2019s official stance on coronavirus. \n\n\n\nThe issue here is that anyone can use Extinction Rebellion fonts and logos to make materials resembling the groups signature messaging. Earlier this year, we reported on a white nationalist group who appeared to have produced stickers that mimicked the climate activist group, but deliberately stirred up racial tensions. \n\n\n\nIt is also possible whoever is behind these stickers sees themselves as part of Extinction Rebellion. None of the group\u2019s Twitter accounts are verified, making it very easy to start an account if you feel aligned with the group\u2019s message and want to form a branch. However, the group does have an official branch list here which does not list Extinction Rebellion East Midlands.", "lang": "en"}
