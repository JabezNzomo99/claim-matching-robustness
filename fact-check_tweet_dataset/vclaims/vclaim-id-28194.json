The post also includes a composite image of two photos of two journalists with eye injuries. The claim is misleading as some of the photos have been used in the wrong context; one photo collage of professional football players has been doctored to include eye patches; a photo in one composite image shows a different Palestinian journalist who suffered an eye injury in a separate incident.\n\nThe photos were published here on November 18, 2019, in a Facebook post. It has been shared more than 120 times. The post contains multiple composite images and several photos of people covering their left eye and holding signs.\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSOLIDARITY ACTION OF COVERING LEFT EYE IN PALESTINE\n\n\u201cSeveral world football stars covering their eyes as an act of solidarity with Gaza journalist Muaz Amarineh who was shot in the eye by an Israeli sniper. \n\n \u2026\n\n\u201cSeveral Gaza journalists held a solidarity action for Muaz Amarineh who was shot by an Israeli sniper while covering a demonstration in Khalil, West Bank. \n\n \u2026\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe journalist mentioned in the post, Muath Amarneh, was blinded in his left eye during clashes between Israeli border police and Palestinian demonstrators in Hebron, a city in the West Bank, on November 15, 2019. The misleading Facebook post\u2019s caption refers to Hebron as Khalil, as it is also known. Amarneh claims that he was shot in the eye by Israeli forces, as AFP reported here. Israeli police have denied the charge.\n\nSimilar photos were also published alongside a similar claim on Facebook here and here. The posts have been shared more than 300 times.\n\nThe claim is misleading as some of the photos have been used in the wrong context. One photo in the first composite image shows a different Palestinian journalist who suffered an eye injury in a separate incident.\n\nA reverse image search on Google and a subsequent keyword search found the first image includes a photo of Attia Darwish, a photojournalist who suffered an eye injury during protests in Gaza in December 2018.\n\nThe photo was published here in a report by the World Health Organization (WHO). The photo's caption reads: \u201cAttia Darwish hit in the face by a tear gas canister.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the WHO report:\n\nAnother reverse image search found that the other photo in the first composite image does show Amarneh moments after he sustained the eye injury on November 15, 2019.

The owner of the Instagram account, a designer named Muhammad Mansour, told AFP he edited the composite image. \u201cThat is my photo design,\u201d he said via Instagram direct message.\n\nHis Instagram post's caption reads: \u201cWhat if one of your favorite celebrities has been in an accident that caused him to lose one of his eyes. What would have been your reaction? fortunately this hasn't happened but unfortunately this is what happened to the journalist Moua'ad Amarneh as a result of being shot by one of the Israeli occupation snipers while covering the confrontations and outrage that is happening now in Hebron which caused the aforementioned journalist to lose his left eye.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Instagram post:\n\nThe photo in bottom far-right corner of the Instagram post also shows Amaneh. The rest of the images show football stars; from bottom centre clockwise: Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Neymar Jr, Paul Pogba, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Mohamed Salah, Luka Modri\u0107 and Sergio Ramos.\n\nGoogle reverse image and keyword searches found the undoctored photos of the football stars were published on various sites.
