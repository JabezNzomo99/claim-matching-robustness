In a video of Floyd\u2019s arrest, a Minneapolis police officer, identified as Derek Chauvin, can be seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, despite Floyd repeatedly saying he couldn\u2019t breathe, according to The New York Times. Chauvin was arrested on murder charges Friday.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, which the Secret Service briefly put under lockdown on Friday night, The Hill reported.

Reuters and WLWT, a Cincinnati-based NBC affiliate, posted videos of the protests at the Statehouse from different angles on their respective YouTube pages.\n\n\u201cOf those on the [statehouse] grounds, a few began to commit acts of vandalism, damaging some windows, light fixtures and doors,\u201d Staff Lt. Craig Cvetan, the public affairs commander for Ohio State Highway Patrol, told Newsweek. \u201cOne protester was able to gain access to the Statehouse through a broken window to an office; however, the protester fled back out the window before troopers could apprehend him from the interior. He was taken into custody by Columbus police when he exited the window.\u201d\n\nThe Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board, which maintains the Ohio Statehouse, said in a press release that 28 windows, 5 exterior light poles and several flags sustained damage.", "lang": "en"}
