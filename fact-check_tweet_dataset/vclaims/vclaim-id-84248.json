The claim is false; the amount shown in the photo appeared due to a technical error; the driver told AFP he was not actually charged the fee.\n\nThe photo was shared here in a Facebook post on April 27, 2019.\n\nThe photo shows a fee for $3,158.72 Singaporean dollars on a car park payment machine.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post\u2019s caption says: \u201cVia Whatsapp. No Need Survey! Another Numero Uno for SG!! The Highest Parking Fee In The History Of Motor Vehicles!!!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nBelow the photo, there is a lengthy message which states: \u201cIf you go to Jewel, park at B3, B4 & B5 are ok. Don\u2019t park at B2 & B2M as they are reserved as short term parking (within 90mins)... any excess parking over 90mins you will be charge as $5 for every 30 mins. Hence a 2hrs parking will cost you $20.\n\n\"Don\u2019t anyhow park your car at Jewel. Apparently car was parked for 10 days where the owner went for a holiday: 10 days x 24 hours x 60mins x $0.219 per min. Total is $3158.72 (very costly holiday).\u201d\n\nThe photo used in the misleading post was originally posted on Facebook here on April 24, 2019 by Supra Mac.\n\nIn a Facebook message, Supra Mac told AFP that he had taken the photo.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Mac told AFP that he was in the Jewel carpark for 15 to 20 minutes and when he left, it showed him the high charge.\n\nHe said he asked the security guard to open the gate for him, and he left without paying the charge.\n\nJewel told AFP by email that they would not comment on the incident.\n\nBut a spokesperson for Jewel told Singapore's Straits Times newspaper in this April 27 report that the incident occurred because the driver's previous exit from the area had not been registered.\n\n\"'We confirm that this was a case that took place on April 10 in the Jewel loading/unloading bay,' the spokesman said on Friday. 'There was no record of the driver leaving the carpark, and hence the parking charge snowballed until the next visit, which took place on April 24.'\"\n\nThe official, current parking rates at the airport carpark appears on the airport\u2019s website here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the parking rates:", "lang": "en"}
