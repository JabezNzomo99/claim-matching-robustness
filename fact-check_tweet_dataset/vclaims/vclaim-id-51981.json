The video is viral with a message in Hindi, which translates to, \"There is limit to dishonesty. They should now be economically banned.\"\n\nBOOM had debunked the same video in 2018, when it was viral with a similar communal narrative. The video was viral since August 2018 among Pakistani Facebook users. It shows the boy speaking in Pashto, a language spoken mainly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2018, BOOM was also able to find a YouTube video which stated that the incident took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province. While the YouTube video is no longer available BOOM\u2019s Fact Vs Fiction show had featured it earlier. A reference to the video was also made by Karachi-headquartered newspaper The News International in its editorial about raising awareness about hygiene and sanitation.", "lang": "en"}
