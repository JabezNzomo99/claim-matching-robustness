The original photo was credited to Go, when he was still special assistant to the President.\n\nAs for the claim that Duterte is \"doing the rounds\" during the coronavirus pandemic, he had a surprise inspection of checkpoints in northern Metro Manila at the start of the Luzon-wide lockdown on March 17. Since then, his public appearances had been limited due to physical distancing measures intended to stem the spread of the outbreak.\n\nAll persons going near Duterte and those who would be in the event area where the President is present are required to undergo rapid coronavirus tests. Those covered by these guidelines include high-ranking government officials, PSG troopers, and close-in personnel who always accompany the President.\n\nDuterte also reportedly went into self-quarantine from late March until April 7, after he was exposed to some government officials who either tested positive for COVID-19 or were exposed to another positive case. \u2013 Michael Bueza/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
