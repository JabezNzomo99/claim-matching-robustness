Nana Akufo-Addo increased agricultural output and Ghana is currently exporting many food items as a result of the planting for food and jobs initiative.\u201d\n\nTo assess this claim, we will look at the Agriculture sector growth rate during the former government and compare to the performance of the sector in the current administration.\n\nTo ensure a fair assessment of the two governments, we will have to leave out the last years of their respective tenures including 2016 and 2020.\n\nAfter striking a three-year average of the growth rates recorded in the Agricultural sector under the NDC and NPP, it is true that the current government has performed better than the previous administration.\n\nGhana has increased exports of food items to neighbouring countries from 85,000 MT to 133,145 MT between 2017 and 2019, Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Attah disclosed in the 2020 Mid-year budget and pointed at government\u2019s Planting for Food and Jobs initiative for the improvement.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that between 2017 and 2019, Agricultural sector growth has declined consistently.\n\n\u201cJohn Mahama presided over low industrial growth during his four years in office. Nana Akufo-Addo has increased industrial growth and building and reviving many factories under IDIF, etc..\u201d\n\nThe current government has averagely performed better in three years compared to the same period under the former administration. So, the claim is true.\n\nThe average inflation rate in the first three years of the current government is better than what pertained during a similar period under the former government. So, the claim by Vice President Bawumia is true.\n\nAfter scrutinizing four claims by the Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, we rate them as true.", "lang": "en"}
