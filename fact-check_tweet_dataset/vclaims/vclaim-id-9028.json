{"title": "Refugees in Lebanon and the UK", "subtitle": "Exact figures are hard to come by, but it seems correct to say that there are 10 times as many refugees in Lebanon as in the UK.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-9028", "url": "https://fullfact.org/news/refugees-lebanon-and-uk/", "vclaim": "Refugees in Lebanon and the UK\n\nA tweet posted this morning says that Lebanon is the size of Devon and Cornwall combined, and that it shelters 1,500,000 refugees to the UK\u2019s 150,000.\n\nThe first part of this claim has done the rounds on social media before and is accurate: Lebanon is 10,400 km\u00b2, while the combined area of the traditional counties Devon and Cornwall is 10,270 km\u00b2.\n\nThe second part is trickier.\n\nLebanon hosts just over a million Syrian refugees, according to the United Nations.\n\nThis is in addition to around half a million other refugees, most of them Palestinians, who are registered with a separate UN agency. That figure is disputed, however, with recent research indicating that only around half that number are actually in the country.\n\nIt\u2019s also complicated to work out the \u2018refugee\u2019 population of the UK. The Home Office told us that it doesn\u2019t keep a running total.\n\nThe UN gives a figure of 123,000 refugees in the UK, plus 46,000 people with an asylum application being processed. Last year, it was 117,000 plus 36,000 pending applications\u2014which may be the source of the claim that there are 150,000 refugees living here.\n\nBut as there\u2019s no definitive number for refugees in the UK, there are other ways this could be calculated.\n\nThe UN gets its figure by counting the number of people who have been granted asylum in the past 10 years. People who were accepted as refugees more than 10 years ago don\u2019t appear as \u2018refugees\u2019 in its statistics.\n\nRefugees can apply to become British citizens after six years. It seems reasonable to stop describing people as refugees after 10 years, as the circumstances of people in the UK for a decade or longer will often be very different to those fleeing recent persecution.\n\nFor many of Lebanon\u2019s refugees, there is no similar path to citizenship. Its large Palestinian refugee population is made up of people who fled Israel/Palestine after the war of 1948\u2014as well as subsequent conflicts, notably the Six Day War\u2014and their descendants.\n\nThese Palestinian refugees generally can\u2019t get Lebanese citizenship. They have \u201climited access to government services,\u201d according to the UN, and \u201chave to depend almost entirely on [the UN] for basic services\u201d. They can\u2019t own their own home and many still live in refugee camps.\n\nSo there are Palestinians who have lived in Lebanon for decades, or were in fact born there, who still qualify as refugees legally and live lifestyles similar in many respects to people who have fled persecution more recently.\n\nThat complicates the comparison with the UK, which has no equivalent population. Refugees who have arrived in the UK since World War Two will have eventually been absorbed as citizens.\n\nNone of this to deny Lebanon has a great number of refugees. Even allowing for some variation in the figures, it hosts more refugees per head than any other country: 1 for every 4 Lebanese citizens. The equivalent for the UK, based on the figures above, would at its maximum be 1 in 380.", "lang": "en"}
