The Trussell Trust says on average, people who were referred to them used a food bank twice last year\u2014which they told us included children\u2019s use too. So this suggests that around 220,000 children may have used Trussell Trust food banks over this period.\n\nThe Trussell Trust\u2019s latest figures cover the six months from April to September 2017. During this time 209,000 three day supplies were given to children.\n\nNone of these figures count use of food banks not run by the Trussell Trust. The Trussell Trust\u2019s food banks are thought to roughly account for around two-thirds of the food banks in the UK.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked into the reasons behind rising food bank use here.", "lang": "en"}
