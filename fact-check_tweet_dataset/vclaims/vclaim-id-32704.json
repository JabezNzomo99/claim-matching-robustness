The hoax has been debunked in previous election cycles.\n\nThis claim has cropped up occasionally in recent years, with each image alleging that ICE agents will patrol all polling stations for undocumented immigrants on Election Day, Nov. 3, 2020. It urges other Facebook users to \u201cspread this like wildfire.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Caller found no indication that ICE plans to take such action in any press release or media report. Britney Walker, a spokeswoman for ICE, confirmed in an email to the Caller that the post\u2019s claim was \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cICE does not patrol or conduct enforcement operations at polling locations,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAny flyers or advertisements claiming otherwise are false.\u201d (RELATED: Is An Ex-Buttigieg Staffer In Charge Of Voter Protection For Nevada\u2019s Democratic Caucuses?)\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, misinformation about voting and polling stations appeared on social media websites. For instance, a doctored image on Twitter appearing to show an ICE agent arresting someone in line to vote went viral before Election Day in 2016, according to The New York Times.", "lang": "en"}
