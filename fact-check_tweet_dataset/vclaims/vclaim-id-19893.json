That\u2019s a meeting of leaders of most of the world\u2019s industrial powers for discussions on economics and security.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the president announced a $110 billion arms deal and the Saudis said that business leaders had signed deals \u201cpotentially\u201d worth more than $200 billion over the next 10 years. In a speech, Trump claimed that \u201cwe signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s one thing to announce such deals and another thing to actually follow through with them. At the time of the signing, such deal numbers are especially inflated, which is why the word \u201cpotentially\u201d slips into the talking points. At least some of the Saudi investments predated Trump\u2019s election, but apparently have now been repackaged as a deliverable on the president\u2019s trip.\n\nAs for the number of jobs, thousands appears to have morphed into millions. But an analysis published by The Washington Post reported that the U.S. companies involved would not confirm any specific number of jobs saved or supported, suggesting that Trump\u2019s original estimate of \u201cthousands\u201d was more guesswork than reality. Our colleague Steven Mufson reported that the deals would create jobs \u2014 in Saudi Arabia. \u201cMost of the deals unveiled Saturday were memorandums of understanding rather than solid contracts, and thus still require further negotiation,\u201d he added.\n\nA White House official said Trump was not talking just about the Saudi deals but \u201cbenefits to trade from the entire trip from Saudi Arabia to the G7.\u201d He noted that \u201cany improvement on trade would save many jobs. Stopping even one bad trade deal can save millions. Changing the infrastructure of global trade to tilt it back toward the U.S. would save and create millions.\u201d\n\nPredicting the impact on jobs from trade agreements often is a fool\u2019s errand. Most mainstream economists do not believe that the number of jobs is significantly affected by trade policy. The composition of the workforce may change \u2014 which is why some communities may be adversely affected by trade deals while others gain \u2014 but in general the gains or losses, measured against the overall size of the U.S. economy, is minimal.\n\nThere is, of course, a long history of presidential administrations touting imaginary job gains from trade deals. \u201cI believe that NAFTA will create 200,000 American jobs in the first two years of its effect,\u201d President Bill Clinton said in 1993, when he signed supplemental agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u201cI believe that NAFTA will create a million jobs in the first 5 years of its impact.\u201d\n\nClinton was relying in part on analyses generated by the well-respected Peterson Institute for International Economics. Two years later, after a financial meltdown in Mexico and collapse of the peso evaporated any job gains from NAFTA, the economist who generated the forecasts famously said he would stay away from job forecasting in the future.\n\n\u201cNAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters,\u201d concluded the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. \u201cThe net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP [gross domestic product]. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment.\u201d\n\nIn claiming job savings from trade deals not yet concluded, Trump is counting his chickens before they hatch. Even if he succeeds in reorienting U.S. trade policy, jobs gains are still likely to be illusionary. That\u2019s all the more reason to be cautious about such pronouncements. Ultimately any gain in jobs under Trump\u2019s presidency will be recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the reality may not live up to the hype.", "lang": "en"}
