In this context, a video of a reservoir has been shared on social media with the claim that it represents Pavna dam in Pune. \u201cOpened floodgates of one of the four reservoirs in Pune, India\u201d, reads the message along with the 14-second video clip.\n\nAlt News found one more tweet with a similar claim saying \u2013 \u201cPaunadharam dam near to Pune.\u201d\n\nWe have received several requests to fact-check this claim on our Android Alt News App.\n\nAlt News used InVid to break down the video into multiple frames. Upon reverse searching one of the frames, we found the same video posted in April 2019. According to this post, the video is of a dam on the Yellow River in China.\n\nUpon further searching with keywords \u2018Yellow River dam\u2018, we came across the same video on YouTube published in November 2018 with the description, \u2018The huge and amazing Water flow of Yellow river discharged from Xiaolangdi Dam in China\u201d. Xiaolangdi dam is in Jiyuan, in the Henan province of China.\n\nWe also found a tweet by the Chinese news agency Xinhua, which had posted a video of the dam in July 2018.\n\nAlt News juxtaposed a frame from the viral video with a video of the Xiaolangdi dam to ascertain that the two are indeed the same. The juxtaposed image is posted below. Moreover, the colour of the water seen in both the videos is brown. This is due to siltation.\n\nIn conclusion, the video in question represents not the Pawna dam in Pune but the Xiaolangdi dam on the yellow river in the Henan province of China.", "lang": "en"}
