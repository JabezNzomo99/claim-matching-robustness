And what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s change those certifications. The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans\u2019 unemployment is actually now lower than general population. It was higher when I came into office.\"\n\n \n\n We wondered if Obama had his statistics correct.\n\n \n\n We looked at data on veterans\u2019 employment compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We focused on two categories of veterans -- all veterans, as well as those who have specifically served in the post-Sept. 11, 2011, armed forces. While Obama didn\u2019t specify what type of veterans he was referring to, the context suggests he was referring to post-9/11 veterans.\n\n \n\n The statistics for all veterans\n\n \n\n Unemployment rate for all veterans, January 2009: 7.4 percent\n\n Unemployment rate for the general population, January 2009: 7.8 percent\n\n \n\n Obama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when he came into office, so by this measurement, he\u2019s wrong.\n\n \n\n Unemployment rate for all veterans, September 2012: 6.7 percent\n\n Unemployment rate for the general population, September 2012: 7.8 percent\n\n \n\n Obama had said veteran unemployment is now lower than the general population, so on this measurement, he\u2019s right.\n\n \n\n The statistics for post-9/11 veterans only\n\n \n\n Unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans, January 2009: 8.9 percent\n\n Unemployment rate for the general population, January 2009: 7.8 percent\n\n \n\n Obama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when he came into office, so by this measurement, he\u2019s right.\n\n \n\n Unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans, September 2012: 9.7 percent\n\n Unemployment rate for the general population, September 2012: 7.8 percent\n\n \n\n Obama had said veterans unemployment is now lower than the general population, so on this measurement, he\u2019s wrong.\n\n \n\n Tallying the results\n\n \n\n So, whichever measure you use, Obama\u2019s formulation was half-right.\n\n \n\n We should also note, as we have in the past, that presidents do not necessarily have a large impact on either rising or falling unemployment, since the nation\u2019s labor market is sufficiently big and dynamic to be shaped by multiple factors beyond just presidential policies. However, presidential policies may have a bigger impact on employment among veterans than on other types of workers, since the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies have specific policies aimed at boosting veterans\u2019 employment.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n Obama said, \"Veterans\u2019 unemployment is actually now lower than (the) general population. It was higher when I came into office.\" Whether you\u2019re talking about all veterans or just those who served after 9/11, Obama gets one number right but one number wrong. So we rate his claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
