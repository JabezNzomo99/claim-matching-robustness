The tweet had amassed over 3,100 retweets before it was taken down. Below is a tweet which shared the video with the same caption.\n\nThe video was also shared by GSVKapoor who later took it down and several others on Twitter.\n\nSeveral Alt News application users have requested us to fact-check this viral video. Similar requests were also received on our official WhatsApp number (+917600011160).\n\nAlt News found that this was a TikTok video that was uploaded by Jabir Khan on May 15.\n\nIn the original video posted below, one can clearly hear that a group of people are chanting \u2013 \u201cAbu Asim Azmi Zindabad(3) Mumbai police Zindabad(3) Sajid Bhai Zindabad(2)\u201d \u2013 and not Pakistan Zindabad as claimed on social media.\n\nFurthermore, Alt News reached out to SP district president Sajid Siddiqui. He said, \u201cThis video was taken on May 14 at Chatrapati Shivaji station on Platform 18. The train was scheduled from CST to UP\u2019s Banda city. We were working from 4-5 days to send these migrant workers back home. Initially, they were told that money will be collected for the tickets. Later Zone-4 DCP Saurabh Tripathi helped us and made sure that they boarded free of cost\u201d. Siddiqui sent us a photograph of him walking along with Abu Azmi.\n\nHe also sent us a video shot from a different angle where the same people can be heard raising the slogans.\n\nWhile tagging the office of Uddhav Thackeray and the Maharashtra cyber cell, Azmi called for strict action to be taken against those who put out the misinformation.\n\nA video of SP leader Abu Azmi was therefore shared with the false narrative that his supporters were heard raising \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans at Mumbai\u2019s Wadala station.", "lang": "en"}
