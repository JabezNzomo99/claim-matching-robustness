Another version of the same message claims that based on a suggestion from Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, PM Modi decided to setup a fund for battle casualties and weapon purchase.\n\nIn 2016, Indian Army veterans had officially announced that a fund has been setup for the \u2018Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualties\u2019. The announcement came in the wake of Siachen avalanche disaster when several organization and personnel wished to financially contribute to the kins of battle casualties. However, the fund is not meant for procurement of weapons for army. The official document issued by the official website of Army veterans states, \u201d The donations received in the fund are utilized to pay financial assistance / grant to widows of our Battle Casualties, their next of kins and dependents.\u201d It may be noted that the account details given in the viral message are accurate. While the viral message is asking people to donate to Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), CRPF comes under the Home ministry while the Indian Army comes under Defence ministry. Also, this wasn\u2019t an initiative by actor Akshay Kumar as it is being claimed on social media.\n\nAccording to news report, the message had also gone viral on WhatsApp after the Uri attack that took place more than two years ago. Incidentally, the Additional Directorate General of Public Information \u2013 Indian Army had also issued a clarification days before the Uri attack. The claim was earlier debunked by The Quint.\n\nThe \u2018Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualties\u2019 was setup for financially supporting the kin of battle casualties, and not for collecting funds for weapon purchase, as suggested by the viral social media message. The message on social media, mentions the correct account number but the description of the objective of the fund is misleading.\n\nYou can donate to the families of CRPF martyrs on Ministry of Home Affairs\u2019s portal, BharatkeVeer. It was reported in media that the BharatKeVeer portal was Akshay Kumar\u2019s brainchild which Home Ministry executed. However, it may be re-emphasized that the portal aims to help the next kin of slain soldiers financially and not to purchase weapons.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use UPI to contribute to this account.", "lang": "en"}
