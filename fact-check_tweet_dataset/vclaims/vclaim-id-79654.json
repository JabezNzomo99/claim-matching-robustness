For the purposes of brevity, we will not post the entire passage attributed to Allen, but it begins:\n\n\"Tim Allen is credited with writing this ... Here are some interesting points to think about prior to 2020, especially to my friends on the fence, like moderate Democrats, Libertarians and Independents and the never Trump Republicans and those thinking of \u2018walking away\u2019 from the Democratic party \u2026 Women are upset at Trump\u2019s naughty words -- they also bought 80 million copies of 50 Shades of Gray \u2026 Not one feminist has defended Sarah Sanders. It seems women\u2019s rights only matter if those women are liberal \u2026 No Border Walls. No voter ID laws. Did you figure it out yet?..\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That\u2019s because there\u2019s no evidence the actor actually said this.\n\nBefore we get to that, we want to note that we have fact-checked some of the claims made in the statement:\n\nNo, House Democrats did not vote to allow noncitizens to vote as part of HR 1\n\nWill Trump's border wall cost less than Obamacare website?\n\nA meme about migrant cell phone use at the U.S. border takes an AP photo out of context\n\nNo, the Green New Deal doesn't aim to end air travel, as Florida Sen. Rick Scott says\n\nBut as to whether Tim Allen \u2013 a Republican who has been open about his conservative viewpoints in interviews \u2013 actually said or wrote this, a review of all the available evidence indicates the answer is no.\n\nNot one media organization reported that Allen authored the post and the statement was not posted to any of Allen\u2019s official social media accounts.\n\nClaims that Allen said this began surfacing in late August 2019, when other fact-checking organizations came across similar posts.\n\nBut it appears that days before social media posts began crediting Allen with the statement, a version of it was posted on the Facebook page of singer Ted Nugent, who is also known to be a vocal conservative.\n\nA day later, the message was shared by a Facebook user who is coincidentally named Tim Allen, but is not the actor.\n\nIt is likely the actor was misattributed after another man with the same name shared it.", "lang": "en"}
