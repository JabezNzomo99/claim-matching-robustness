But even more so is what you hear, that because of the cancellation the numbers have increased. Yes, it is true; it moved from nearly 7000 to 14000 but when we restored the teacher trainee allowance, in fact we are hovering 15700, many more than when they cancelled, or double when they cancelled [the allowances],\u201d he asserted.\n\nIn response, the ranking member on the Education Committee and NDC Member of Parliament (MP) for Akatsi North, Peter Nortsu-Kotoe, said the cancellation of the allowances followed the recommendation of the Prof. Anamuah-Mensah Committee report and the government white paper endorsing the recommendation.\n\n\u201cWith the cancellation of teacher trainee allowances this was in a white paper signed by the former president of this country, HE John Agyekum Kufuor. I want him to refer to that white paper. A committee was formed and Prof. Anamuah-Mensah was the chairman of that committee. He recommended the cancellation of allowances at the teacher training colleges and that was what was implemented. And the implementation of that rather provided access for more students to enter training colleges,\u201d he argued.\n\nThe 29-member Prof. Jophus Anamuah-Mensah Committee was inaugurated on 17th January 2002 to review the entire educational system in the country with the view to make it more responsive to current challenges.\n\nThe committee submitted its report to the government on the basis of the government white paper issued in 2004.\n\nWe also spoke to Prof Anamuah-Mensah who said the Committee did not recommend a cancellation of allowances.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Prof Anamuah-Mensah said.\n\nAdditionally, after careful scrutiny of the committee\u2019s report, Dubawa could not find any specific recommendation for the cancellation of the allowances.\n\nHowever, there was a recommendation on page 261 of the report (https://new-ndpc static1.s3.amazonaws.com/pubication/Meetn+the+Challenges+of+Educ+in+21st+Century.pdf) which made a proposal for cost-sharing in teacher education.\n\nIt recommended that the government should continue \u201cto pay the allowances for teacher trainees for the time being but should be reviewed from time to time.\u201d\n\nIt said, \u201cthe government should encourage the use of other innovative and cost-effective strategies such as distance learning and modular courses in the training of pre-service teachers.\u201d\n\nThe cost-sharing recommendation was explained in Table 7.8 below.\n\nThus, though the committee\u2019s report shifted most of the recurrent expenditure items to parents/students, it did not recommend a cancellation of the allowances.\n\nWhat did the government white paper say?\n\nOn page 41 section 23.1, under Financing of Education, the government white paper accepted the recommendation of cost-sharing captured in the committee\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cIn addressing the crucial issue of financing of education the committee identified various innovative ways by which Government could generate additional resources to cope with the perpetual insufficiency of the educational budget. Government endorses the recommendations to explore the variety of sources proposed and is open to additional suggestions from the public on the matter. In addition, the GETFund has proved to be of great benefit. Government will continue its policy of revenue diversification as a strategy for financing education. In this regard, the government accepts the cost-sharing arrangements proposed in the report,\u201d it stated.\n\nAgain, after a careful study of the government white paper on the report of the education reform review committee, Dubawa could not find any explicit plan by the then government to cancel the allowances of trainees.\n\nBased on the specific claim of the Ranking Member on parliament\u2019s education committee, Peter Nortsu-Kotoe, that the cancellation of the allowances was implemented based on the recommendation of the Prof. Anamoah Mensah committee and the government white paper on the committee report, we rate the claim as false.\n\nThe reporter produced this fact-check under the auspices of the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship in partnership with The Finder Newspaper to facilitate the ethos of \u201ctruth\u201d in journalism and to enhance media literacy in the country.", "lang": "en"}
