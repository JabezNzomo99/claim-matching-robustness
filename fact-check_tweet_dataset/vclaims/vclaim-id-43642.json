Mohandas Pai and BJP MP, Subramanian Swamy as its latest victims. \u201cShocking list. One Indian political party included\u201d tweeted Pai while sharing an article listing the ten most corrupt political parties in the world in 2018. The list was published in July 2018 and featured the Indian National Congress among other parties from different parts of the world. According to this list, INC ranks 2nd among the most corrupt political parties of the world. Pai has now deleted his tweet.\n\nBBC News Hub is a dubious website that is not related in any way to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The \u2018About us\u2019 section is equally hilarious. It states, \u201cbbcnewshub.com is best place to provide complete, brief, correct, healthy and strong content for the respectable visitors which are related to all over the world. It provides the national and international current and all type of information.\u201d\n\nThe poorly worded article is full of grammatical mistakes. The article starts with a laughable description of political parties, stating that \u201ca political party is a union of people who work conjointly and struggle against one another to win political power; political parties do hire member or contenders, these parties are also to run and organize elections to decide the government of any country in the world.\u201d It goes on to describe Indian National Congress as \u201cthe powerful reigning party in India\u201d and then announces that \u201cevery general election is leaded by Indian National Congress due to its majority in most regions.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to imagine that anyone would fall for this website after reading the first few sentences. Even the title reads as Top 10 list of most corrupt political \u201cparty\u201d in the world. But T.V. Mohandas Pai had plenty of company in others who also took such an obviously fake website at face value and shared its list. From an author of fake news website Postcard News to Vivek Agnihotri and Subramanian Swamy, the list is long.\n\nSocial media users brought it to Mohandas Pai\u2019s notice that he has tweeted a link to a fake news website. This did not seem to deter Pai who chose to defend his tweet.\n\nTrushar Barot, Digital Launch Editor with BBC also tweeted to Mohandas Pai requesting him to delete his tweet as it could lead to perpetuation of this misinformation, to which Pai replied,\n\nIt was only later in the day that Mohandas Pai deleted his tweet.\n\nIn November last year, the same website listed PM Narendra Modi among \u201cTen most corrupt Prime Ministers in the world\u201d.\n\nIn yet another \u2018list\u2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s family ranked 2nd among \u2018Top 10 Most Corrupt Families In The World 2018\u2019.\n\nMohandas Pai is no stranger to this tendency of falling for fake news. Earlier, the former Infosys director had retweeted a tweet by Times How, a parody account of Times Now.\n\nSeveral media organisations including Alt News have busted the claims of this fake news website in the past, yet social media users continue to fall for it. In most cases when people come across content that reinforces their beliefs and prejudices, they share it without exercising any critical evaluation.", "lang": "en"}
