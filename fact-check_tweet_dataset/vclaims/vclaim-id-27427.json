The said letter is dated on November 11 and reads, \u201cDear Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Let me begin by congratulating you and your bench Justice S.A. Bobde, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, Justice Ashok Bhushan & Justice S. Abdul Nazeer for your stupendous contribution to Hindu Rashtra. Hindus will always be grateful to you and your team for your compendable and memorable decision, which will make a new history for Hindu Rashtra. I wish you and your family the very best for your future endeavours and once again congratulate you for this remarkable decision. Thank you for the wonderful support at this crucial time.\u201d\n\nThe letter has been trending on social media, primarily on WhatsApp.\n\nAlt News has receieved several requests to fact-check the image on WhatsApp.\n\nAs an official correspondence, the language used in the letter is inconceivable. Statements \u201cHindus will always be grateful to you and your team for your commendable and memorable decision, which will make a new history for Hindu Rashtra\u201d and \u201cThank you for the wonderful support at this crucial time\u201d are used to create a perception of conflict of interest within the government.\n\nThere is also a typo in the two-paragraph letter. The word \u2018commendable\u2019 is spelt as \u2018compendable\u2019.\n\nMoreover, if the letter was truly sent by the Prime Minister it would have made national news. Alt News was unable to find any such reports in the media.\n\nAfter performing a reverse image search on Google, we discovered a similar letter written by PM Modi to Gautam Gambhir.\n\nOn comparing both the letters, we spotted that the letter being circulated as \u201cNarendra Modi writes a congratulatory letter to the Chief Justice\u201d doesn\u2019t have the saffron and brown border at the bottom. Nor does it mention the address of the recipient at the bottom, as seen in Gambhir\u2019s letter.\n\nTaking a closer look at both the letters, one can observe that the background texture in Gambhir\u2019s letter is consistent throughout the letter, as highlighted below.\n\nHowever, the viral letter does not have a consistent texture. The textured background is only present where there are no words.\n\nThe official Twitter account of the High Commission of India in Bangladesh shared a tweet on November 13 refuting the claims.\n\nBased on visual analysis and lack of reports in the media, it is clear that the image circulated as \u201cNarendra Modi writes a congratulatory letter to the Chief Justice\u201d is inauthentic.\n\n[This article was updated on November 14, 2019, to include to tweet of High Commission of India in Bangladesh.]", "lang": "en"}
