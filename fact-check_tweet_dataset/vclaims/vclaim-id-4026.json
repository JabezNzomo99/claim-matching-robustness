No, there is no evidence for this at all, just a report by an unreliable website that habitually takes some real news from other sources and then adds a headine and introductory paragraph that doesn't contain any sourced facts and is usually made up in order to gain traffic and advertising revenue by abusing the trust of gullible people who don't check their sources.\n\nThe nuke report originated from an article published on April 30, 2018 by YourNewsWire titled \"Israel Drops Tactical Nuclear Bomb On Syria\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAn Israeli airplane in Syria has dropped the first nuclear bomb deployed in armed conflict since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, according to local reports. The nuclear blast targeted an ammunitions depot in Hama, Syria and was so powerful it caused a 2.6 magnitude earthquake recorded close to Taqsees, Hama, Syria at 10:40 pm local time Sunday, at the same time Syrian TV reported several explosions in the same area. Moments later, videos of a massive set of explosions, reportedly at a Syrian military base at Jabal al-Bukhut 47, some 10 miles south-east of Hama, began to appear on social media.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, possibly scaring them into thinking World War III had started:\n\nLocal reports did indeed report a strike on an ammunition depot and the videos of the resulting explosion seem real enough:\n\nAs is typical of ammo depot explosions, a huge blast can be observed followed by many smaller flashes in the air as various airborne bits of ordnance cook off. It doesn't look like a nuclear explosion though and there is no reason to suppose there was one.\n\nThe video YourNewsWire embeds also doesn't mention a nuclear blast, it is captioned:\n\nThe YourNewsWire article fails completely to provide links to any of the \"local sources\" that supposedly reported that this was a nuclear strike. And even the official Syrian news agency only reports it as a \"rocket attack\":\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: 'Smallville' Star Did NOT Confess She Sold Children To Rothschilds And Clintons\n\u2022 Fake News: Superstar DJ Avicii Found Dead But Did NOT Expose Pedophile Ring\n\u2022 Fake News: 'Smallville' Actress Faces 15 Years But NOT For Providing Kids To Hollywood Pedos\n\u2022 Fake News: US Surgeon Found Dead Did NOT Expose Clinton Foundation Corruption In Haiti\n\u2022 Fake News: California Did NOT Ban Parents From Pulling Kids From 'Obscene' LGBT Sex Ed Classes", "lang": "en"}
