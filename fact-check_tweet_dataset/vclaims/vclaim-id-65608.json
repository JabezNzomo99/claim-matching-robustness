This particular post, shared over 19,000 times, attempts to credit Reagan, who served in the Oval Office from 1981 to 1989, with a quote about Democrats restricting \u201cfreedoms,\u201d \u201chistory\u201d and \u201csafety.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep voting Democrat,\u201d Reagan allegedly said in 1987. \u201cOne day they will restrict your freedoms, restrict your history and restrict your safety. All in the name of professional victims that don\u2019t understand the consequences of their ignorance.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of Reagan saying the quote in 1987 or any other year. Searching the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library\u2019s digital archive and the National Archives turned up no matches. It also does not appear in his presidential diaries, correspondence or autobiography.\n\n\u201cWe have all his official speeches and I could not find this quote for that year or any other between 1981-89,\u201d Reagan Library archivist Michael Pinckney said to Snopes.\n\nMelissa Giller, chief marketing officer at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, also told USA Today that the quote \u201cis not a true quote.\u201d (RELATED: Is The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library In Danger Of Closing Permanently Due To Coronavirus?)\n\n\u201cI have access to a database where I can search all of President Reagan\u2019s quotes,\u201d she said. \u201cI searched the quote multiple ways using phrases from the post, and there is absolutely zero records of him saying this. This is not a true quote.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
