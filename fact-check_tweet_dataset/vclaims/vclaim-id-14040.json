Kennedy spoke of a \u201cplot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child\u201d just one week before he was assassinated.\n\nThere is no indication that Kennedy said this days before his assassination, or at any other time.\n\nWhile conspiracy theories about Kennedy\u2019s assassination have existed for years, this theory implies that Kennedy was killed to keep him from exposing some sinister plot to \u201censlave\u201d citizens of the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot,\u201d the image claims Kennedy said a week before he was assassinated.\n\nKennedy was assassinated in Texas on Friday, Nov. 22, 1963. Seven days before that would have been Friday, Nov. 15. On that day, Kennedy gave a speech to the AFL-CIO where he talked about the economy. The quote from the image does not appear in that speech in full or in part.\n\nKennedy also spoke that day at the National Convention of the Catholic Youth Organization. He did not mention a plot to enslave Americans in that speech either.\n\nThe quote does not appear in any of Kennedy\u2019s other speeches or on the quotations page of the Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asked about this statement fairly often here in the research room, and we\u2019ve never found evidence to verify that John F. Kennedy said or wrote it,\u201d Stacey Chandler, an archivist with the Kennedy Library told The Daily Caller in an email.", "lang": "en"}
