Miriam Loomis disappeared when she was 20-years-old and likely died at 35, according to the coroner. That puts her death somewhere around 2000, but the coroner says there\u2019s about a three to four-year margin of era [sic].\n\nThe photograph included in the article is taken from a November 2016 Daily Mail article, about Todd Kohlhepp, a South Carolina man suspected of multiple murders.\n\nThe entirely fabricated Miriam Loomis story was republished the same day by the Daily USA Update web site, with the added (false) claim that the (non-existent) woman had gone missing in Houston, Texas in 1985 and \u201clikely died pregnant.\u201d\n\nThe Last Line of Defense is a self-described satirical web site and a known purveyor of fake news.\n\nThis is just the latest in a series of deaths falsely attributed to or associated with the Clintons over the last few decades. In this case, the death itself did not even take place.", "lang": "en"}
