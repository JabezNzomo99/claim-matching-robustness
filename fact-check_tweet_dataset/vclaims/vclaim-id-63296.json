I Fkn knew it! We are locked until all the towers are done\u201d. The featured comment, circled in red, reads, \u201cMy hubby\u2019s mate just called him on Thursday to say he\u2019d just counted about 10 (towers) going up in Wellington. He saw one of the workers that he knew so pulled over to ask him. He said, bro we signed a contract we are not allowed to discuss\u2026but we\u2019ve got four weeks to get these up!\u201d\n\nThe screenshot is accompanied by the Facebook user\u2019s comment, \u201cEnd The Lockdown, Bring them down!\u201d\n\nThe March 30 post has attracted more than 51,000 views, 400 shares and 80 comments.\n\nThe first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) in New Zealand was reported on February 28, 2020. As of April 2 there have been 723 confirmed cases in NZ and one person has died.\n\nOn March 23, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the New Zealand government would lift its COVID-19 alert level setting from two to four following a spike in the number of cases. A nationwide lockdown for a four-week period came into force from 11:59pm, March 25, with restrictions placed on travel and movement. A state of emergency was also declared.\n\n5G is the next generation of mobile communication technology, however some groups have raised questions regarding health risks posed by the network. The World Health Organization and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), say there is no established evidence that exposure to 5G and other wireless communications cause adverse health effects.\n\nIn a media release on December 16, 2019, New Zealand\u2019s Minister of Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Kris Faafoi said: \u201c5G offers significantly improved data speed and capacity for conventional mobile and fixed wireless broadband networks, and will enable the next wave of productivity and innovation across multiple sectors.\u201d\n\nOn January 14, 2020 the Prime Minister\u2019s Chief Science Advisor said in a media release that NZ\u2019s 5G network had launched in some locations, initially in Alexandra followed by \u201cparts of Westport, Twizel, Tekapo, Hokitika and Clyde\u201d. The release also says: \u201cVodafone launched 5G in parts of Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown in December 2019.\u201d\n\nA Newshub report on August 29, 2019 stated that \u201cfive new 5G mobile sites are now live in Auckland\u201d ahead of the network\u2019s launch in December 2019. It also reported that a further \u201c95 sites also scheduled to be operational by (that) time\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for NZ\u2019s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), which is responsible for the 5G contracts, told AAP FactCheck in an email that any claim of a link between the COVID-19 lockdown and the 5G rollout is \u201ccompletely untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 is a global problem and many countries are imposing national or regional lockdowns. The rollout of 5G is likely to be delayed not accelerated by the COVID-19 restrictions and economic impacts. New Zealand is not locked down for the purpose of installing 5G towers,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that \u201cwe\u2019ve got four weeks to get these up!\u201d is also untrue, the MBIE said.\n\n\u201cVodafone\u2019s 5G rollout in Wellington (and in Auckland, Christchurch and Queenstown) has been well publicised and is required to be completed in accordance with planning and resource management consents,\u201d the spokesperson told AAP FactCheck.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the COVID-19 emergency powers to override that and, therefore, no deadline which needs to be pushed to complete work before or by the end of the COVID-19 level four alert lockdown.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP Factcheck found the Facebook post to be false. The installation of 5G towers around New Zealand began in August 2019 before the country\u2019s state of emergency and COVID-19 lockdown announcement on March 23, 2020. New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment told AAP FactCheck any link between installation of 5G towers and the four-week lockdown is \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d. The ministry said there was no push to complete NZ\u2019s 5G rollout before the end of the lockdown period. False \u2013 The claims made in the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
