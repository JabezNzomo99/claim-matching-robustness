Rick Scott travels the state with a rap sheet of talking points laying out all he\u2019s done to lower taxes \u2014 a topic, no doubt, on many Floridians\u2019 minds ahead of Tax Day. (Tuesday!)\n\nScott launched into this list during a roundtable discussion in Pensacola on April 7.\n\n\"We\u2019ve cut taxes 55 times. Our job growth rate is showing almost double the rest of the country. Our labor force is growing four times the rest of our county, and we have the second-lowest tax burden, per capita, state taxes in the country,\" Scott said.\n\nWe previously evaluated an earlier version of Scott's 55 tax-cut claim, rating a statement that he cut taxes \"more than 40 times\" as Half True.\n\nWe decided to focus here on whether Florida\u2019s tax burden is the second-lowest in the land.\n\nFlorida taxes near the bottom of pack\n\nAlmost all credible analyses of Florida\u2019s tax burden have the Sunshine State paying some of the lowest taxes per capita in the country.\n\nAccording to the Florida Department of Revenue, the state collected about $38.6 billion in state and local taxes in fiscal year 2016. In 2016, Florida\u2019s population, according to the U.S. Census, was about 20.6 million. Do the math, and that\u2019s a little more than $1,800 in taxes collected per person, or capita.\n\nOther estimates are close to our own.\n\nScott\u2019s office pointed us to the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning. Using the most recent data from the U.S. Census, it found Florida collected $1,836 in per capita state taxes in fiscal year 2015.\n\nThat amount gives Florida the distinction of having the second-lowest state taxes per capita out of all 50 states.\n\nOur own calculation, achieved by comparing the U.S. Census 2015 Annual Survey of State Government Tax Collections (the most recent year) to 2015 population data, also puts Florida as the place with the second lowest state taxes.\n\nA slight wrench in Scott\u2019s factoid is that state taxes are not the only type of taxes that Florida collects.\n\nAccording to Florida Tax Watch, a group that takes a critical look at state spending, Florida ranked 27 out of 50 states for per capita local tax collections in fiscal year 2014.\n\nKurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of research, said Florida\u2019s local tax burden is far higher than the state\u2019s tax burden.\n\nFlorida\u2019s low state tax burden combined with a middle-of-the-road local tax burden still leaves Florida with some of the lowest taxes per capita. The same Tax Foundation analysis cited by Scott ranks Florida as having the fifth-lowest state and local taxes per capita.\n\nThe problem with per capita figures is context, said Richard C. Auxier, a research associate in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute.\n\nThe per capita figure includes millions of people, namely children, who either pay no taxes or pay a nominal amount (the sales tax on a toy purchased with allowance money, for example).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean that all Floridians pay low taxes.\n\nFor example, Florida\u2019s lack of an individual income tax is good news for high earners. But low-income residents may feel more of a benefit with living in a state with a lower sales tax (Florida\u2019s is 6 percent, which is about the 16th-highest rate in the country).\n\nOne more thing: A state\u2019s tax burden is the result of many factors, not just the influence of one chief executive.\n\nNorth Dakota had some of the highest taxes per capita in the latest fiscal year, but that\u2019s not because North Dakota is a high tax state, it\u2019s because the state experienced an oil boom which brought in more tax dollars that year than other years prior.\n\nScott said Florida has \"the second-lowest taxes, per capita, state taxes of any state in the country.\"\n\nBased on our own calculations, as well as a credible analysis from the Tax Foundation, Florida has the second-lowest state taxes per capita (behind Alaska).\n\nWhen you include our middle-of-the-road local taxes, Florida still hovers around the bottom for per capita taxes, but it\u2019s not the second-lowest. And it\u2019s important to remember that just because a state\u2019s per capita taxes is low, it doesn\u2019t mean everyone in that state has low taxes.\n\nScott\u2019s measurement is accurate but doesn\u2019t quite tell the whole story. We rate Scott\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
