If you go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site and plug in the data, you will indeed see 54 straight months of job gains in the private sector, after the dizzying drops in the Great Recession.\n\nMoreover, going back as far as the Labor Department kept such statistics (1939), it\u2019s clear there has never been a period this long without a decline. (Some might quibble about Obama\u2019s use of \u201chistory;\u201d it is certainly as long as such records have been kept.)\n\nIn Clinton\u2019s case, that one-month blip stemmed from a massive blizzard that struck the East Coast in January 1996. In Washington, the impact of the blizzard was so bad that Clinton had to shut down the federal government for a week.\n\nThe net result on job creation was a monthly nationwide decline of (just) 2,000 jobs. That month was clearly an anomaly because 129,000 private-sector jobs were created the month before \u2014 and 397,000 the month after.\n\nA White House spokesperson countered that the past 54 months have included more than its fair share of unexpected headwinds, including international events such as the European sovereign debt crisis, the 2011 tsunami and nuclear accident in Japan, and the disruption of Libya\u2019s oil supply; extreme weather such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and this year\u2019s coldest winter since the 1970s; and the government shutdown in October 2013. So the argument is that private-sector job creation kept going despite those obstacles.\n\nThere is another caveat: The average number of jobs created in this period is significantly lower than in either the Clinton or Reagan period, as shown in this Tableau interactive chart created by Wall Street Journal reporter Matt Stiles. As he noted, the average monthly gain during this period is in the bottom half of the 17 jobs recoveries lasting 12 months or more in the past 75 years, with an average of 186,000 jobs created every month. By comparison, the periods in the Reagan and Clinton eras generated at least 240,000 private-sector jobs a month.\n\nThe White House, however, argues that such comparisons are a bit facile. For instance, the 1980s expansion was aided by the fact that millions of women surged into the labor force, while the current period has been hampered by the wave of retiring baby boomers.\n\nThe current period has also been notable for the huge cutbacks in public-sector jobs, which the White House argues makes the private-sector job performance more impressive. (New jobs in the public sector, and the resulting paychecks, obviously help generate additional private-sector jobs.) So the White House argues that the continued private-sector growth, in the face of massive public-sector cutbacks, is especially significant.\n\nHere\u2019s a chart, from the Calculated Risk blog, that shows the decline in public-sector jobs under Obama, compared with other presidents. Obama is the only recent president under whom cumulative public-sector job creation is negative.\n\nWhile some might argue that Obama\u2019s statistic is based on a technicality \u2014 and that the pace of job creations lags many other periods of extended growth \u2014 the fact remains that the president\u2019s assertion is correct. He also appropriately prefaced his statement with a nod to the fact that the recovery has been sluggish: \u201cfor all the work that remains.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
