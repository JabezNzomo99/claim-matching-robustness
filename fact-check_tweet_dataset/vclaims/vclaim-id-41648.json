All of these companies have not had any reported cases in the news. Yet, every employee in these companies encounters thousands of people a day. None of these companies have closed stores. However, all of a sudden, all the meat packing plants are closing and small businesses are still not allowed to open. None of this makes any sense at all.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Here\u2019s just a sampling of the news stories documenting different cases.\n\u2022 In Worcester, Mass., one Walmart closed in April after 23 employees there tested positive for COVID-19.
