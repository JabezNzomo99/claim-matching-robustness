It may have evolved from the writing of ancient Confucian philosopher Xunzi.\n\nThe internet is replete with quotes attributed to the founding fathers, Franklin in particular. However, there is no evidence that this particular saying originated with Franklin, a signee of the Declaration of Independence and highly influential inventor. (RELATED: Did Benjamin Franklin Say, \u2018Any Fool Can Criticize, Condemn And Complain\u2019?)\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched the collected writings of Franklin but found no record of it or any variations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never encountered it. And \u2018involve me\u2019 sounds very un-Franklin,\u201d says H.W. Brands, author of \u201cThe First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin,\u201d in an email to the DCNF.\n\nThomas Kidd, author of \u201cBenjamin Franklin: The Religious Life of a Founding Father,\u201d also told the DCNF in an email that he had never encountered the quote.\n\nThe statement may actually have evolved from the writing of ancient Confucian philosopher Xun Kuang, better known as Xunzi, according to the website Quote Investigator. Xunzi wrote a thematically similar statement in one of his works, which was translated into English and published in \u201cXunzi: The Complete Text.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot having heard of it is not as good as having heard of it. Having heard of it is not as good as having seen it,\u201d reads the saying from Xunzi. \u201cHaving seen it is not as good as knowing it. Knowing it is not as good as putting it into practice.\u201d\n\nThough Franklin did not coin the expression attributed to him in the Facebook post, he was an advocate for education. In his 1749 publication \u201cProposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania,\u201d Franklin wrote, \u201cThe good education of youth has been esteemed by wise men in all ages, as the surest foundation of the happiness of both private families and of commonwealths.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
