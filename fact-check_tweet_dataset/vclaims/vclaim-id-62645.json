I DON\u2019T!!!\u201d it says.\n\nThe same claim appears on Twitter here and here.\n\nThe CDC tracks influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations and deaths every flu season.\n\nFlu fatalities are estimated weekly, based on death certificate data, by the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the CDC.\n\nThe NCHS says that \u201cthe data for earlier weeks are continually revised and the proportion of deaths due to P&I (pneumonia and influenza) may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received.\u201d\n\nThe NCHS estimates that more than 7,500 Americans died from the flu between January 5 and May 9, 2020, according to a tally of its weekly data.\n\nCOVID-19, which has killed more than 93,000 people in the US since it emerged in late 2019, is affecting whether patients seek healthcare, the CDC says, so illness data should be interpreted cautiously.\n\nAFP Fact Check has addressed other false or misleading claims about the flu, available here and here, and has debunked at least 460 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
