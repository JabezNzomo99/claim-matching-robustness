Did media have the courage to show this news? -translated)\n\nA Twitter user, @MLARajeshSP tweeted the same claim which had garnered close to 400 retweets before it was deleted.\n\nMultiple people on Facebook and Twitter have shared the message. According to the message, Nirav Modi in a London court had said that he paid a huge amount to the government minister, BJP leaders and officials to help him flee India.\n\nA report published by the Times of India on March 21, has specifically quoted the words spoken by Nirav Modi in Westminister\u2019 magistrate court, \u201cI do not consent\u201d. This was in response to a question asked by the District Judge Marie Mallon. According to the report, the only other details that he gave were his date of birth and address. Alt News couldn\u2019t find any other media report where the statement in question was ascribed to Nirav Modi.\n\nAlt News contacted Naomi Canton, a journalist based in London. Canton, who reports for the Times of India in the UK confirmed that the statement attributed to Modi is, \u201cfake news\u201d. She said, \u201cI was in court and Nirav Modi did not say this in open court. He spoke just to confirm his name and gave his date of birth and address. He was asked if he consented to extradition and he said I do not consent. Other than that it was just his barrister who spoke and the CPS.\u201d\n\nA photoshopped screenshot of News 18 India is also doing the rounds on social media, where this fake statement has been credited to Nirav Modi.\n\nA cooked-up statement was ascribed to Nirav Modi on social media to target the BJP leaders and ministers in regards to their complicity in his escape from India.", "lang": "en"}
