Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling to keep the economy shut down so as to hinder Donald Trump\u2019s re-election chances.\n\nThough she has deleted her original tweet, Melton doubled down, saying, \u201cWe don't know for sure if she really tweeted it.\"\n\nWe do, however, know for sure that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t tweet it. As a popular political figure, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s social media pages are frequently saved in the internet archive the Wayback Machine. Her Twitter profile was archived on May 21, and does not show the tweet. Additionally, ProPublica maintains a database that archives deleted tweets from politicians. The alleged tweet from Ocasio-Cortez does not appear on her page in the database.\n\nMelton\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
