It is not clear when exactly the video was created.\n\nAlt News had debunked this misleading post earlier this week and had found a video from 2009.\n\nBOOM investigated further and found an older video uploaded to YouTube that dates back to August 25, 2007. The caption of the video says '5 Germans Converted to Islam'.\n\nClick here to view the video\n\nCorrection: A previous version of the article incorrectly identified the preacher as Sven Lau.
