It turns out he\u2019s correct.\n\nThomas did not respond to requests for comment, but he likely got his statistics from a budget request that Lucian Niemeyer, assistant secretary of defense for energy, installations and environment, provided to the House Committee on Armed Services on April 18, 2018.\n\nNoting that the Department of Defense needs a steady flow of investment to keep its bases in good condition, Niemeyer requested more money for the 2019 fiscal year to compensate for low funding in past years.\n\n\"As a result of limited investments in previous budgets for facilities sustainment and recapitalization, 23 percent of the Department\u2019s facility inventory is in \u2018poor\u2019 condition \u2026 and another 9 percent is in \u2018failing\u2019 condition,\" Niemeyer said in prepared testimony.\n\nInfrastructure is a broad term. In this context, it seems to refer primarily to the buildings on military bases.\n\nPentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb confirmed the numbers in the budget request are accurate.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the DOD budget President Donald Trump ultimately proposed for 2019 was more than $686 billion, with about $10.8 billion devoted to maintenance and repair for facilities.\n\nThomas said, \"Currently, 23 percent of our military\u2019s infrastructure is graded as \u2018poor\u2019 while 9 percent is \u2018failing\u2019.\"\n\nThese numbers are in line with what the Department of Defense reported to Congress last year.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
