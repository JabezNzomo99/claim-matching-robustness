To be hosted by either Katherine Thomas or possibly Nicky Byrne, INTG will feature an initial station-by-station search, followed by a second stage where successful candidates are brought to the judges houses, to make sure they get on with the judges of Ireland and everyone knows 'how things work'.\n\nRT\u00c9 is indeed Ireland's state broadcaster but there is no trace of the new show on their website. It would be strange indeed, since the \"Garda\" is Ireland's national police force and they typically don't select their leadership based on a reality tv show. And no, they don't mention the show on their website either.\n\nAnd of course Whaterford Whispers News carries following disclaimer:\n\nWaterford Whispers News is a fabricated satirical newspaper and comedy website published by Waterford Whispers News. Waterford Whispers News uses invented names in all its stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.\n\nSo don't be fooled even if the summary of the story on social media does look somewhat realistic and you never know in these crazy times...\n\nTHE hunt for the new Garda Commissioner is to be televised on RT\u00c9 later this Autumn, in a glitzy reality-based TV extravaganza that will sift through hundreds of applicants in a bid to find 'Ireland's Next Top Garda'.", "lang": "en"}
