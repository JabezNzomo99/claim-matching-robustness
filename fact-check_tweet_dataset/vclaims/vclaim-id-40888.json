The graphic claims that Duterte said the government has completed distributing cash assistance to those affected by the novel coronavirus pandemic. But the graphic has been doctored; it has been manipulated to include the purported Duterte quote and has been disowned by the PNA.\n\nThe graphic was published on Facebook here on April 6, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \"Game over. Someone's already collected? 275 Billion for Covid 19 emergency who now holds and benefits? #ihatecorruption #stealvirus\".\n\nThe quote, which is dated April 3, 2020 and attributed to Duterte, reads: \u201cI would like to congratulate the DSWD and DBM as well as local officials for the 100% completion of distribution of social amelioration benefits to the needy in a record setting time.\u201d\n\nDSWD and DBM are acronyms for the Department of Social Welfare and Development and Department of Budget and Management, two government agencies involved in administering the Philippines\u2019 recently-enacted cash assistance program for low income households affected by the COVID-19 emergency.\n\nThe same graphic was also shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here with a similar claim that it was an official quote from Duterte.\n\nThe PNA took to Facebook on April 6, 2020 to deny publishing the graphic, saying that it was \u201cmaliciously culled\u201d from another quote card.\n\n\"The Philippine News Agency clarifies that such quote card of President Duterte congratulating the DSWD, DBM, and local officials for the supposed 100 percent completion of the distribution of social amelioration benefits was never published. It was maliciously culled from a quote card posted on its Facebook page on April 4, 2020,\u201d the statement read.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of PNA\u2019s statement showing a comparison of the doctored quote card and the original:\n\nThe original PNA graphic, which can be viewed here, quotes Duterte saying in a mix of English and Tagalog: \u201cI am calling upon the ROTC, get in touch with DSWD. Those in cities, just give your accreditation, maybe an ID and help (in distribution).\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original PNA graphic:\n\nAn official government transcript of Duterte\u2019s April 3 speech matched the quote on the original PNA graphic. At no point in his remarks does Duterte say the cash assistance program is complete.", "lang": "en"}
