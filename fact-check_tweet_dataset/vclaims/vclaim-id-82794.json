Nick Rahall (D-W.V.) features stale claims and out-of-context quotes in an attempt to scare seniors.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-02-02T18:55:47Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82794", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/06/20/four-pinocchios-for-yet-another-democrat-mediscare-ad/", "vclaim": "That $6,000 claim is based on a 2011 analysis by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), using data from the Congressional Budget Office, regarding Ryan\u2019s original plan. The report said that in 2022, when the premium support system then was expected to go into effect, a beneficiary\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses would double, from $6,000 to $12,000.\n\nUnder Ryan\u2019s 2012 revision, the premium support payment would be based on the cost of the second least-expensive private plan or traditional Medicare, whichever is lower. Any difference in costs would need to be made up by the beneficiary. But Medicare benefits of at least one plan supposedly would be covered by the premium-support payment. But in 2014, Ryan moved to an \u201caverage-bid\u201d plan \u2014 meaning the average of all bids submitted by private insurers and traditional Medicare.\n\nIn a September 2013 report, CBO found that the \u201caverage-bid\u201d option would actually provide savings for beneficiaries; the same report essentially retracted the 2011 analysis that formed the basis of CBPP\u2019s $6,000 projection. (CBO says its modeling has improved.) CBPP in its most recent examination of the Ryan plan reiterates that, in its view, over time costs would rise and traditional Medicare would be eroded. But there are no numbers as definitive as the original estimate of a $6,000 gap.\n\nIndeed, the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2012 calculated that the gap would be much less than $6,000. The report suggested that if the revised Ryan plan had been in effect in 2009, the additional payment would have added up to less than $800 a year.\n\nThe ad suggests that the candidate is talking about raising Medicare premiums. But in fact the quote has to do with completely different subject \u2014 Medicaid, the government-run health care program for the poor. Jenkins was interviewed by Charleston Daily Mail for an article on how the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid would begin to require co-payments for some recipients \u2014 because he was executive director of the West Virginia State Medical Association.\n\nUnder current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid rules, states cannot charge Medicaid recipients more than $8 for non-emergency trips to a hospital emergency room. For inpatient care, states can charge patients as much as half the cost for their first day of treatment, or set a nominal fee. For outpatient care, states only can charge a $4 co-pay if patients\u2019 income is below the federal poverty line. That doesn\u2019t seem like much, but state Sen. Evan Jenkins, D-Cabell, said studies have proven even small co-payments encourage health care consumers to reconsider unnecessary medical services\u2026. \u201cWith a little financial skin in the game, they will think about that co-pay when deciding whether or not \u2018I really need to go to the doctor,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cWhen something is free, we don\u2019t place a very high value on it. We may take it for granted and we may over-utilize.\u201d And that is exactly what is happening at hospitals around the state. Dale Wood, chief quality officer for Charleston Area Medical Center, said most people who arrive at emergency rooms are soon sent back home. \u201cDepending on the type of hospital, it may be as high as 80 percent go home,\u201d he said.\n\nIn other words, Jenkins was quoted as an expert, not in a political context. The ad leaves the impression that Jenkins is perfectly happy as a policy-maker to force seniors to pay $6,000 more in premiums a year, when in fact he wasn\u2019t talking about seniors\u2014and the actual co-pays generally turned out to be a few dollars a visit. (Technical note: there are some poor, elderly Americans on Medicare who also use Medicaid to fill in gaps in Medicare\u2019s benefit package but they generally are exempted from the new rules.)\n\nThe Rahall campaign stood by its ad. Officials claimed it was not about the Ryan budget but something deeper. \u201cThe point of the ad is that Evan Jenkins believes in raising seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket costs, just like his wealthy backers,\u201d a campaign statement said. \u201cThey share that belief whether it\u2019s Medicare or seniors\u2019 copays \u2013 the consequences are the same: seniors pay more.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
