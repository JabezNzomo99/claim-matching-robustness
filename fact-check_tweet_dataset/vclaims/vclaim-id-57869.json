Akash RSS shared the clip with the following message, \u201cSee the condition of Hindu girls after they fall for the trap of love Jihad. These girls leave their religion and parents for peaceful boys who do this to them after satisfying their lust.\u201d The word \u2018peaceful\u2019 is a derogatory term used for members of the Muslim community. Alt News is not providing any links to the video due to its graphic nature.\n\nAkash RSS is \u2018Akash Soni\u2019. In a 2017 report, Alt News had investigated that he was the man behind a popular fake news website Coverage Times. Another report published in June 2018 revealed that he was one of the individuals running misinformation and propaganda Facebook page \u2018BJP All India\u2019. Soni was also found to be behind the targetted harassment of journalist Ravish Kumar through a WhatsApp group.\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook with the \u2018love Jihad\u2019 claim.\n\nThe video was earlier viral with the message, \u201cHumanity is dead. This is barbaric, sad, and shocking. Is he an executioner? I request nation\u2019s police officers punish him in a similar way.

We performed this search on Facebook as Google did not throw up results matching the description of the video.\n\nThe first result on Facebook leads to a post on the page \u2018Feminic\u00eddio \u2013 Parem de nos matar\u2019 which publishes cases of femicide in Brazil. The post said that Thalia Torres de Souza (23) was hacked to death with an axe in Granja Portugal, Fortaleza.\n\nA subsequent keyword using the woman\u2019s name led us to several other Facebook posts in Portuguese. \u2018Aracati Pol\u00edcia 24hs\u2019 uploaded a picture of the woman where she can be seen in the same clothes as the viral video. This post is from August 30.\n\nThus a gruesome video from Brazil is circulating with the false claim that a woman was hacked to death in India after falling for the trap of \u2018love Jihad\u2019. Alt News has debunked several such gory videos from Brazil that are misrepresented in India.", "lang": "en"}
