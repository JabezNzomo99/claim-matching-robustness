Although we love his songs and his character, as a company, our marketing team has decided that he is no longer fit to serve as a brand ambassador to Wrangler. We made this decision based on our strong Christian beliefs. We proudly serve God and it is in our best interest to not associate our brand with someone who disobeys the laws of the Lord.

To us that indicates deception is going on so in accordance with our Satire Policy we rate this story \"False\".\n\nWe wrote about lfrsolutions.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: R&B Legend Sisqo NOT Given 6 Months to Live, NOT Diagnosed With Advance Lupus\n\u2022 Fake News: Caitlyn Jenner NOT Pissed None of Her Kids Wished Her a Happy Mother's Day", "lang": "en"}
