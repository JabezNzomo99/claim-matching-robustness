Col. Michelle Baldanza told Voice of America.\n\nThe Pentagon says the USS Porter attempted to contract the Russian aircraft and received no response. The Russian aircraft did not have their transponders on, the Pentagon said.\n\n\u201cSuch incidents are concerning because they can result in accident or miscalculation,\u201d Balganza said.\n\nThe USS Porter was conducting routine maritime operations in international waters in the Black Sea following the conclusion of a regional military exercise, the Pentagon said.\n\nAn Air Force official later told Military.com that officials do not believe the Russian aircraft involved in intercepting the NATO planes were the same ones involved in the USS Porter flybys.\n\nThe official also said that the intercept of the Russian aircraft by NATO aircraft \"is not the first time this has happened. This happens almost every time U.S. and NATO aircraft fly - especially in the Baltics.\"\n\nU.S. Lt. Col David Faggard, a U.S. European Command spokesman, told Polygraph.info: \u201cU.S. military aircraft and ships routinely interact with Russian units and most interactions are safe and professional. However, we have deep concerns when there is an unsafe maneuver.\n\n\u201cUnsafe actions have the potential to unnecessarily escalate tensions between countries, and could result in a miscalculation or accident which results in serious injury or death,\u201d he said. \u201cSovereign nations have the right to operate freely in accordance with international law. We expect safe and professional conduct by all parties in international waters and airspace.\u201d\n\nBut Russian military spokesman Konashenkov told reporters that he has no knowledge of the alleged unsafe flying practices on February 10.\n\n\u201cWe have not received any complaints or appeals from the Pentagon or personally from General Tod Walters regarding some dangerous encounters involving Russian aircraft on February 10,\u201d Konashenkov said.\n\nStill, Russian warplanes have engaged in numerous unsafe encounters with other aircraft in recent years, according to reports from multiple countries.\n\nIn April 2016, the U.S. said a Russian Su-27 \"performed erratic and aggressive maneuvers\" 50 feet away from U.S. aircraft.\n\nSimilar incidents have continued in air space over the Black Sea.\n\nIn June 2016, Estonia, a member of the EU and a NATO ally, accused Russian military air forces of violating the nation's airspace.\n\nIn September 2016, Iceland said Russian bombers posed danger to civilian aircraft.\n\nIn October 2016, and Estonia said Russian military jets violated their airspace.\n\nIn December 2016, Sweden advised towns to make preparations for potential attacks by Russia. previously reported three \u201cnear collision\u201d encounters with Russian jets in 2014.\n\nMilitary analyst Michael Kofman told Polygraph.info that these actions represent \"intentional messaging behavior, which [the US and Russia] should be quite practiced with given it was how [they] interacted through much of the Cold War.\"\n\n\"The principal agreement that [the Russians] have been violating of late is called INCSEA, the Incidents at Sea Agreement, which dates back the 1970s,\u201d Kofman added. \u201cIt was originally signed between the U.S. and USSR to reduce this sort of brinkmanship at sea - understandably the more dangerous interactions typically take place over international waters.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
