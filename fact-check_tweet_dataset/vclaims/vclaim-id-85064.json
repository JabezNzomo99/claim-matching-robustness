After historic dissions and plans\u2026.implemented by Maharashtra Govt. It\u2019s the time to stand strong with our government. So lets trend #KisanThanksDevendra and show our support to our beloved Devendra Sarkar.\u201d In an attempt to build public opinion against Farmers\u2019 long march to Mumbai, the BJP\u2019s social media supporters were up to their usual tricks. The 22 page Google document provided tweet templates to BJP supporters and was circulated on the party\u2019s WhatsApp group.\n\nA screencast video of the document can be seen below:\n\nEven as thousands of farmers were on the streets to press their demands in an unprecedented rally, #KisanThanksDevendra was the hashtag planned to initiate a fake twitter trend showing an overwhelming support for the Fadnavis government. Clearly rattled by this show of strength, the \u2018IT cell\u2019\u2019s social media strategy involved singing praises of the Fadnavis government, maligning the opposition and discrediting the Farmers\u2019 march. Some of the sample tweets were as follows:\n\n\u201cWhy has the Left suddenly become active to take the farmers\u2019 cause? Why is that only farmers from northern Maharashtra participating in the farmers\u2019 morcha? #KisanThanksDevendra\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Year of 2016-17 Maharashtra Govt invested 56000 Cr in Agriculture #KisanThanksDevendra\u201d\n\n\u201cUrban Maoist cadres are participating in it, they are poor tribals and not farmers. Their demand is about farming rights in forest. Communist want another incident like like bhima koregaon, Congress, NCP providing tacit support for this. #KisanThanksDevendra\u201d\n\nAlt News spotted a copy of the Google Doc circulating in a WhatsApp group of BJP supporters and decided to counter it on Twitter in a series of tweets.\n\nSoon other Twitter users caught on to mock this attempt of the IT cell. In a hilarious turn of events, #KisanThanksDevendra became a joke on Twitter. The trend was hijacked by those sharing jokes and memes about it. The top retweets were for the tweets of Alt News founders exposing the fake trend.\n\nAt-least two of the people accessing the document and tweeting using the #KisanThanksDevendra hashtag were familiar names \u2013 Karan Sharma with Twitter handle @IKaransharma27 and Mehul Jain with Twitter handle @TigerNamo. While Mehul Jain had the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister in his office, Karan Sharma describes himself as a RSS Swayamsevak and is followed by the PM on Twitter.\n\nAfter the Alt News expose, the #KisanThanksDevendra hashtag was abandoned by the IT cell and instead they started tweeting by prefixing all their tweets with \u2018FARMERS WITH DEVENDRA\u2019. With social media users becoming more aware of the tactics of the IT cell, it won\u2019t be surprising if future attempts to force trend hashtags meet a similar fate.", "lang": "en"}
