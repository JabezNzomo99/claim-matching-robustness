The same measure for other common diseases, such as coronary heart disease, strokes and lung cancer, has been falling.\n\nPeople are tending to live longer and healthier lives, so more of us are living long enough to develop dementia. Improving diagnosis rates and a better understanding of the disease have probably also increased the recording of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease on death certificates.", "lang": "en"}
