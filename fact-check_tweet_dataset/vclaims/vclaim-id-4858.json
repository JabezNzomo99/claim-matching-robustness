No, that's not true: the news was spread by a satirical French website, not by a real news source. Unfortunately for Belgium the French victory stands.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Journal Des Insolites on July 10, 2018 titled \"Urgent: la FIFA envisage d'annuler la victoire de la France pour faute d'arbitrage\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLes Bleus defeated the Red Devils 1-0 in the first semi-final of the World Cup in Russia and qualify for the final The French should hold their breath and stop celebrating too soon. We have received information from a source within the governing body of football that FIFA is considering canceling the match between France and Belgium in the semi-finals of the World Cup because of bad refereeing. According to our sources, the Belgian Football Association has submitted a request to cancel the match to the governing body of FIFA World Football due to the huge arbitration fault during the match.\n\nTo the disappointment of many Belgians the website that posted the news carries following satire disclaimer so the story is not true:\n\n24Jours.com assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of some of its articles and the fictional nature of certain content. All the characters appearing in certain articles on this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.
