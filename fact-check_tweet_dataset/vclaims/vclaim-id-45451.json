The meme distorts the details of Floyd\u2019s case and includes a photo of a woman who was badly injured in an unrelated attack in Spain in 2018.\n\nA popular meme has misrepresented a criminal case involving George Floyd more than a decade ago.\n\nFloyd\u2019s death in police custody on May 25 sparked nationwide protests against racism and police violence, which has made the incident a target for misinformation since then.\n\nNow a meme with a photo of a woman\u2019s bruised and bloody face is circulating on social media with this claim: \u201cAracely Henriquez was the woman kidnapped and brutally beaten by George #Floyd and his five accomplices, as they searched her home for drugs and money. She was pregnant at the time, and he asked her if she wanted him to kill her baby.\u201d\n\nBut the woman pictured is not Aracely Henriquez. The photo actually shows Andrea Sicignano, an American student who was raped and beaten in Madrid, Spain, in 2018.\n\nIn a June 12 post on Facebook, Sicignano wrote, \u201cToday my photo is being used as political propaganda/click bait to make people believe that George Floyd deserved to die.\u201d She asked that those who see her photo being used that way report it to Facebook and correct the person who shared it.\n\nThe photo, Sicignano explained in her recent post, was taken at the hospital after she was attacked. She posted it on Facebook shortly after the attack, and the picture was later published in a Spanish newspaper, which is likely where it was taken from for the meme.\n\nBeyond the use of the picture, the meme gets other parts of the claim wrong, too.\n\nFloyd pleaded guilty in 2009 to aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. He was not charged with kidnapping or assault.\n\nAccording to the complaint in the case, filed in 2007, Floyd was one of six men who forced his way into the Houston home that Aracely Henriquez shared with Angel Negrete and a 1-year-old child.\n\nOne of the men claimed to be from the water department in order to get Henriquez to open the door. Then Floyd, who was described as the biggest of the men who pulled up in a black Ford Explorer, forced his way in and \u201cplaced a pistol against the complainant\u2019s abdomen, and forced her into the living room,\u201d the complaint says. It doesn\u2019t say whether or not Henriquez was pregnant.\n\nFloyd then searched the house while another man guarded Henriquez. That man hit her in the \u201chead and side areas\u201d with his pistol after she \u201cscreamed for help,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nSo, while Floyd did plead guilty to a charge stemming from the invasion of Henriquez\u2019s home, the picture circulating with the claim doesn\u2019t show Henriquez and the claim distorts the details of the case.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
