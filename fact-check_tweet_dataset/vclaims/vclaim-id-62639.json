It looks at both in-hospital death data and death certificates to make the estimate, according to the CDC website.\n\nThe April 21 post claims that the flu \u201ckilled 80,000 people in the U.S. last year,\u201d presumably referencing the 2018-2019 flu season. (RELATED: Did The 2009 Swine Flu Pandemic Kill 18,000 Americans?)\n\nBut this statistic is inaccurate. The CDC estimated about 34,200 people died from the flu in the 2018-2019 flu season, with the uncertainty interval indicating the range could be as low as about 26,300 and as high as about 52,700 deaths. Mike Patronik, a spokesman for the CDC, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the estimate is preliminary and \u201cmay change as data are finalized.\u201d\n\nThe death figure cited in the post appears to come from the preliminary estimate that the CDC gave in September 2018 for the 2017-2018 flu season. The CDC said at the time that early estimates indicated \u201cmore than 80,000 people died from the flu last season.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CDC has since updated its 2017-2018 flu season estimate to a lower number: about 61,000 deaths. That figure, which is still preliminary, has an uncertainty interval ranging from roughly 46,400 to 95,000 flu deaths, according to CDC data.\n\nThere have been 24,000 to 62,000 flu deaths in the United States during the 2019-2020 flu season, per a preliminary estimate from the CDC.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
