As you will see, the reports are false.\n\nThe reports spread instantly after the Interfax news agency posted an article citing Bolton\u2019s comments in Baku.\n\nLater in the day on October 24, Interfax followed up with an update that the euro was also reacting to the news of \u201cno additional\u201d U.S. sanctions by falling against the Russian ruble, reaching its lowest value since August \u2013 74.14 rubles to the euro.\n\nThe optimism followed what appeared to be either an incorrect conclusion or a fabrication by Interfax, which claimed Bolton said the U.S. had \u201cno plans\u201d to impose additional sanctions.\n\nHere is what Bolton actually said, according to the Reuters news agency:\n\n\u201cOn the potential for additional sanctions on Russia, we are still considering what we may be obligated to do under a statute related to chemical weapons attacks. No decision has been made at this point, and I wouldn\u2019t predict the timing, whether it might be before the (U.S. mid-term) elections or after the elections. The decision-making is ongoing as we speak.\u201d\n\nReuters also pointed out Interfax had \u201cincorrectly reported\u201d Bolton\u2019s comments.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly denies the U.S. sanctions have any negative effect on Russian economy, while some of his government top officials called the U.S. policy towards Russia \"genocide through sanctions\" -- claims that Polygraph.info debunked on multiple occasions.", "lang": "en"}
