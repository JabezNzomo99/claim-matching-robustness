He only said \u201cEducational Institutions should begin the process of working towards \u2018potentially\u2019 reopening within this phase\u201d. There is no fixed school resumption date.\n\nOn Thursday evening, various online media platforms posted a report that suggests that the Federal Government has ordered full reopening of schools.\n\nSuch stories can be found on NaijaNews, ThePunch, and TheCable among others. Most of them have headlines such as \u2018FG approves full reopening of schools\u2019, \u2018FG okays full reopening of schools\u2019, \u2018Buhari Orders Schools To Reopen Fully Nationwide.\u2019\n\nAll these sources have credited the source of their news to the National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Dr Sani Aliyu, who spoke at a briefing at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, on Thursday.\n\nHowever, this can be misleading for students who have been home for a long time and are eager to go back to school.\n\n\u201cFor educational institutions which include daycare, primary, secondary and tertiary institutions. Educational institutions should begin the process of working towards potentially reopening within this phase\u201d Aliyu said.\n\nHe added: \u201cHowever, we strongly recommend that states conduct risk assessment to ensure all schools are at a level of compliance and create a monitoring mechanism to assess, create, and monitor this level of preparedness.\n\nHe further said: \u201cMeanwhile, all daycares and educational institutions are to remain closed to in-classes until this level of risk is assessed. And if there will be opening of schools, it must be staged and preferably carried out in phases to ensure that this does not pose a risk to the general public and in particular to vulnerable groups that might end up getting infected by students going back home.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted through a text message, Dr. Aliyu denied ever ordering full reopening of schools.\n\n\u201cNo that\u2019s not true. We asked all sub nationals \u2013 that is States \u2013 to do a risk assessment and take a decision based on level of preparedness and Federal Ministry of Education guidelines,\u201d Dr. Aliyu said in a text message to Dubawa\u2019s enquiry.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere won\u2019t be a single date for reopening, (it) will be phased out.\u201d\n\nThe National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Dr Sani Aliyu, never gave orders for schools to reopen as reported by most online platforms.\n\nHe said \u201cEducational Institutions should begin the process of working towards potentially reopening within this phase\u201d\n\nThe word \u2018potentially\u2019 is an adverb that means: \u201cpossibly true in the future, but not true now\u201d, according to Macmillan Dictionary.\n\nDr. Aliyu\u2019s words further suggest that he did not order the reopening of schools.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, all daycares and educational institutions (which, according to him, include daycare, primary, secondary and tertiary institutions) are to remain closed to in-classes until this level of risk is assessed.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cif there will be opening of schools, it must be staged and preferably carried out in phases to ensure that this does not pose a risk to the general public and in particular to vulnerable groups that might end up getting infected by students going back home.\u201d\n\nDr. Sani Aliyu, who was said to have ordered reopening of schools has denied ever saying that. Instead, he said \u201cEducational Institutions should begin the process of working towards \u2018potentially\u2019 reopening within this phase\u201d. There is no fixed time for school resumption yet.\n\nThe researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with Vision FM to facilitate the ethos of \u201ctruth\u201d in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.", "lang": "en"}
