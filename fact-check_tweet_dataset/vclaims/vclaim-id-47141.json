Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cChildren should be raised by the state.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Ocasio-Cortez ever made such a statement. The claim stems from an article published on a satirical website.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who is currently running for reelection, first took office in January 2019 and represents New York\u2019s 14th congressional district. Since rising to national prominence, the freshman congresswoman has become a popular target for misinformation on social media.\n\nThe May 27 article, titled, \u201cAOC: \u2018Children Should Be Raised By The State,'\u201d alleges that the freshman congresswoman wants children to be turned over to the government \u201cso that they can do properly indoctrinated and become model citizens for a new and better American future.\u201d (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Say, \u2018The Only Reason Trump Is Keeping His Campaign Promises Is To Influence The Outcome Of The Election\u2019?)\n\n\u201cOur children are underused in this country,\u201d the article quotes Ocasio-Cortez saying. \u201cOr rather, improperly used. All kids should go to the government.\u201d\n\nBut there is no evidence to support the claim. There are no posts echoing this sentiment on any of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s social media accounts. Nor could such statements be found on her official websites.\n\nAn internet search by the Daily Caller found a nearly identical article published on Taters Gonna Tate, a website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d Yet, white Taters Gonna Tate includes several disclaimers that the piece is satirical, the article being shared on Facebook has no such warning, misleading some social media users to believe it is factual.\n\nThis is not the first time Ocasio-Cortez has been the subject of misinformation this month. Social media users previously shared an image that falsely credited the congresswoman with saying, \u201cOwning guns is not a right. If it were a right, it would be in the Constitution.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
