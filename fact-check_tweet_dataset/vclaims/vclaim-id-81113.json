The claim is false; the video shows one police officer pointing his baton at the woman before another officer detonates a tear gas canister, prompting the woman to move away.\n\nThe ten second video was shared in this Facebook post on June 13, 2019.\n\nThe footage shows a woman shouting at Hong Kong riot police. One officer points a thin black object at the woman\u2019s face before an explosion is heard and the woman recoils. The man next to her is then seen pulling her away.\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s caption says: \u201cA woman shot in the head by Hong Kong Police.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe video was shared one day after police clashed with demonstrators in Hong Kong during a protest against a proposed extradition law on June 12, 2019. Here is an AFP report about the unrest.\n\nThe day after the clashes, groups including Amnesty International Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association criticised what they said was excessive use of police force. Here is an AFP report on the claims.\n\nThe same video was viewed thousands of times after being posted on Twitter here with a caption saying: \u201cHong Kong Police Professionalism - shoot a woman, a mother as well, closely #HK69parade #\u9999\u6e2f\u53cd\u9001\u4e2d\u5927\u6e38\u884c #extraditionbill #HongKongProtests #HongKong #HongKongPolice #HKPD\u201d.\n\nThe same footage has also been included in longer videos, which make similar claims and have been viewed tens of thousands of times on Facebook here and here, on Twitter here, and YouTube here.\n\nThe longer videos include additional footage taken from this video by HK television channel i-Cable News which show the same female protester, at 1:12, pleading with police.\n\nBut the claim is false; the misleading footage actually shows one police officer pointing his baton at the woman while another officer nearby detonates a tear gas canister.\n\nAn analysis of keyframes from the video shows the police officer points his baton at the woman\u2019s face at the five second mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video paused at the five second mark:\n\nBelow is a zoomed in screenshot of the video at the five second mark with the baton circled in red:\n\nHere is an AFP photo taken the same day of other Hong Kong police officers holding batons.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo:\n\nAlso at the same time -- the five second mark in the video in the misleading posts -- another police officer can be seen detonating a tear gas canister, which causes a loud bang.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that moment with the tear gas canister circled in red:\n\nThe same officer then throws the tear gas canister high into the air, while the man standing on the woman\u2019s left hand side pulls her away from police.\n\nBelow are two screenshots of the moment the police officer throws the canister (L) and the moment it sails through the air (R) with the canister circled in red:\n\nThe same incident was filmed from a different angle in this longer Facebook live video published on June 12, 2019 at 5.21pm.\n\nIn the Facebook live video, the police officer can be seen detonating a tear gas canister at 6:50. The same female protester can then be heard again shouting at police, before walking away unaided.", "lang": "en"}
