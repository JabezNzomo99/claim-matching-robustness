The allegations presented in social media posts are unfounded.\n\nThe main false claims presented in these posts are that Dr. Anthony Fauci was the first CEO of Moderna; that Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci were college roomates; that George Soros was the founder of Moderna and that Jeffrey Epstein was the main investor of Moderna until his death.\n\nA video featuring these claims shared over 47,000 times on Facebook is visible here . A text version featuring these claims is visible here .\n\nModerna did not respond to Reuters request for comment, this fact check will be updated if they do.\n\nModerna, Inc is a biotech company ( www.modernatx.com/ ) that has received nearly $1 billion from the U.S. government to develop its coronavirus vaccine. Its candidate, mRNA-1273, is already in late-stage human trials testing its ability to safely prevent coronavirus infection ( here , here ).\n\n\u201cFAUCI WAS THE FIRST CEO OF MODERNA\u201d\n\nThe claim falsely alleges that Anthony Fauci was the first CEO of Moderna when he was \u201ca young graduate from Cornell\u201d.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci obtained a medical degree from Cornell University\u2019s Medical College in 1966, where he graduated first of his class ( here ). He started working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1968, as a clinical associate at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) ( www.oar.nih.gov/about/fauci ).\n\nModerna Inc. was founded over four decades later, in 2010 in Cambridge, Massachusetts ( here ), by Derrick Rossi, Robert Langer, Kenneth R Chien, and venture capitalist Noubar Afeyan ( here , here , here ).\n\nSt\u00e9phane Bancel, was appointed first Chief Executive Officer of Moderna in 2011 and continues to hold the position. ( here )\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci is not listed in Moderna\u2019s board of directors ( here ), scientific advisory board ( here ) nor its management\u2019s team ( here ).\n\nBill Gates was not a student at Cornell University. He enrolled at Harvard University in 1973, seven years after Dr. Fauci graduated from Cornell, and dropped out to co-found Microsoft Corp ( www.gatesnotes.com/Bio ).\n\nThere is also a fifteen years age difference between Gates, born in 1955, and Fauci, born in 1940 ( here ).\n\nSome iterations of the claim also include the false allegation that Bill Gates \u201cdesigned the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) and patened (sic) it under US2006257852\u201d.\n\nThe alleged patent mentioned in the post has nothing to do with RFID technology nor Bill Gates. Reuters previously debunked a claim regarding this patent here . More on the history of the RFID technology is visible here .\n\nThe claim falsely alleges that George Soros ran German conglomerate IG Farben, \u201cbroke it up\u201d and then founded Moderna.\n\nAccording to a DW report here , IG Farben \u201cwas once the world\u2019s largest chemicals company\u201d and was closely linked to the Nazi regime. The German conglomerate came under Allied powers after the end of World War Two and was ordered to dismantle ( here ). Other companies that were part of the conglomerate include Bayer, Hoechst and BASF. IG Farben went into liquidation in 1952 ( here ).\n\nGeorge Soros did not run IG Farben nor did he disband it. When the conglomerate was dismantled, Soros was a teenager. Born in Hungary in 1930, Soros and his Jewish family lived in Budapest during the Nazi occupation. In 1947, he left to study at the London School of Economics ( here ).\n\nSome iterations of the claim also falsely state that Soros was a Nazi. Reuters previously debunked this claim here\n\nModerna was founded in 2010 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Epstein & Company here and Southern Trust, founded in 2012 here .\n\nThe top owners of Moderna are visible here and here .\n\nSome iterations of the claim also falsely state that Epstein generated his fortune through Moderna, but by 2010 when the company was founded, Epstein\u2019s fortune was already well established. (In 2010, Forbes debunked here the notion that Epstein was a billionaire and said he was likely worth \u201ca fraction of that.\u201d)\n\nFalse. Unfounded claims falsely link Dr. Fauci, Bill Gates, George Soros and Jeffrey Epstein to the potential coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
