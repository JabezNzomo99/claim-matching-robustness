The register is the pool from which working nurses and midwives are drawn.\n\nHow many nurses work across the NHS?\n\nThe Prime Minister gets her \u201c13,000 more\u201d line from the official statistics published by NHS Digital.\n\nIt\u2019s true that one category of nurse \u2013 described in the figures as working on \u201cacute, elderly and general\u201d care wards \u2013 has increased by just over 13,000.\n\nThat\u2019s if we start counting in May 2010, when the Conservative-led coalition was elected, and counts full-time equivalent roles.\n\nThe Department of Health told us they want to focus on this figure because it captures most nurses who work on hospital wards specifically.\n\nBut there are lots of other nurses who don\u2019t work on wards, and whose numbers have been cut since May 2010 \u2013 mental health and community health nurses would be two examples.\n\nAccording to NHS Digital, there were a total of 285,893 nurses and health visitors working across the whole of the NHS in March this year, compared to 280,950 in May 2010.\n\nThat\u2019s still an increase under Conservative chancellors, but a less impressive one of around 5,000, or just under 2 per cent.\n\nAnd this comes at a time when workloads are likely to be increasing for many nurses.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no one convenient number for measuring total NHS activity, several important measures we know about, like hospital admissions, accident and emergency attendances, and operations, have gone up dramatically over the last decade.\n\nMrs May and others have chosen their words more carefully on other occasions, referring to a rise in nurses \u201con our wards\u201d. On this occasion, the Prime Minister wasn\u2019t quite accurate.\n\nIt\u2019s right to say that there are 13,000 more nurses working specifically in hospital wards than there were in May 2010, but this is a sub-group of all nurses.\n\nAcross the NHS, the total number of nurses has still risen, but only by around 5,000. And this is at a time of increasing pressure on many areas of the service.\n\nThe numbers Mr Corbyn quoted in parliament refer to all registered nurses, not just those currently employed by the NHS. This number fell in 2016/17 for the first time in recent years.", "lang": "en"}
