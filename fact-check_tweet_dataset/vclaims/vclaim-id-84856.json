I think he\u2019s probably got the toughest skin I\u2019ve ever seen, and I think he\u2019s a terrific guy. I just have to view the economy and the country. I think Bill Clinton has done a terrific job. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been treated very fairly, but I think he\u2019s done a terrific job.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best thing he has going is the fact that the economy\u2019s doing great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it. You know, they talked about the \u201980s were good. The \u201990s are better. I mean, the \u201990s are really much better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure that he shouldn\u2019t have just gone in and taken the Fifth Amendment and said, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t get along with this man, [independent prosecutor Kenneth] Starr. He\u2019s after me. He\u2019s a Republican. He\u2019s this, he\u2019s that,\u2019 and, you know, just taken the Fifth Amendment. It\u2019s a terrible thing for a president to take the Fifth Amendment, but he probably should have done it. I don\u2019t think he could have done any worse than what\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nMATTHEWS: Did you ever have a flicker, when you\u2019re taking a shower or walking to work or waking up in the morning, when you said: \u2018Donald , you\u2019ve won every battle you\u2019ve ever fought. Why don\u2019t you run for governor? Why don\u2019t you run for president?\u2019 Did you ever think about that? : People want me to all the time. MATTHEWS: What about you? : Can you imagine how controversial that\u2019d be? You think about him with the women. How about me with the women? Can you imagine \u2026 MATTHEWS: Well, you might be close, but it\u2019d be no cigar. : Well, they might like my women better, too, you know.\n\nBy early 1999, Broaddrick had gone public with her allegations of a rape by Clinton 21 years earlier. Clinton\u2019s attorney denied the allegation, and no charges were ever brought, though friends told reporters that Broaddrick had informed them of the incident at the time. Her claims were widely publicized, and some GOP lawmakers said the Broaddrick file swayed them to vote for articles of impeachment against Clinton.\n\nTrump likes Clinton, he says, and finds it all too easy to understand why the then president found it hard to answer the question: \u201cDid you f\u2026 Monica?\u201d \u201cWhat he should have done is fought for years not to answer it. I mean, isn\u2019t it amazing and terrible that a guy \u2014 a president \u2014 is put in that position? He could have gone down as truly great and, instead, you know, he\u2019ll be viewed somewhat differently, which is really a shame.\u201d\n\nFinally, in a 2008 interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, Trump argued that Clinton should never have been impeached and that he got into trouble over \u201csomething that was totally unimportant\u201d \u2014 in contrast to George W. Bush, who he said should have been impeached for \u201cgetting us into this horrible war [Iraq] with lies.\u201d\n\nThe record shows that for years, Trump dismissed or minimized the sex allegations against Clinton, even after Willey and Broadderick went public with their claims. His main concern is that Clinton did not handle the public relations of the Lewinsky scandal right; Trump dismissed the women involved as losers and not attractive. Trump even suggested that Americans would have been more forgiving if Clinton had slept with more beautiful women.", "lang": "en"}
