Hear it straight from the horse\u2019s mouth. RahulGandhiPagalHai,\u201d tweeted Krishna (@Athiest_Krishna) along with a clip where Gandhi can be heard saying \u2013 \u201c\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u091c\u0948\u0938\u093e \u092c\u0947\u0935\u0958\u0942\u095e \u0907\u0938 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948| (There is no other fool like me in this country.)\u201d The video attracted over 15,000 views and more than 800 retweets.\n\nSeveral other Twitter users also circulated the same video.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Rahul Gandhi did not call himself a fool. This video has been doing rounds on social media since last year and was debunked by India Today\n\nThe viral clip is only four seconds of a much longer speech that the Congress president gave at Talkatora stadium in the OBC convention on June 11, 2018. Gandhi wasn\u2019t calling himself a fool but claimed to be quoting a BJP OBC MP who came up to him and said that he (the MP himself) was a fool for supporting PM Modi.\n\nHere\u2019s what Gandhi said at the convention, \u201c\u0932\u094b\u0915 \u0938\u092d\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0947 OBC MPs \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u0906\u092f\u0947. \u0938\u091a \u092c\u0924\u093e\u0909 \u092c\u093e\u0925\u0930\u0942\u092e \u0938\u0947 \u0928\u093f\u0915\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0925\u093e \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u094b\u0902\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u091d\u0947 \u0930\u094b\u0915\u093e. \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092c\u0924\u093e \u0938\u0915\u0924\u093e. \u0928\u093e\u092e \u092c\u0924\u093e \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0924\u094b \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940\u091c\u0940 \u0906\u0909\u091f \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0947. \u092e\u0917\u0930 \u091a\u093e\u0930-\u092a\u093e\u0901\u091a \u0906\u090f \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0928\u0947 \u0909\u0928\u0938\u0947 \u092e\u095b\u093e\u0915 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0942\u091b\u093e, \u201c\u092d\u0907\u092f\u093e \u092f\u0947 \u092c\u0924\u093e\u0913 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094b \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0901?\u201d \u090f\u0915 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u0939\u093e\u0925 \u092a\u0915\u095c\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0915\u0939\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u201c\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932\u091c\u0940, \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u091c\u0948\u0938\u093e \u092c\u0947\u0935\u0958\u0942\u095e \u0907\u0938 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948. \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0907\u0928\u0915\u094b \u0932\u093e\u092f\u093e, \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0928\u0947 \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u0906\u091c \u0932\u094b\u0915 \u0938\u092d\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u0926 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940\u091c\u0940 \u092e\u0941\u091d\u0947 \u090f\u0915 \u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092c\u094b\u0932\u0928\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0947\u2026(Narendra Modi ji\u2019s OBC MPs came to me at the Lok Sabha.

It is a part of Gandhi\u2019s Lok Sabha address on Rafale earlier this year where his statement was directed at Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Misinformation has been used in the past to claim that Rahul Gandhi said that Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s non-violence was inspired by Islam. His video of praying at a Dargah was pushed with the narrative that he was praying for a Muslim kingdom in India. There have also been false claims of him taking a U-turn on farm loan waivers and that he termed former Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah\u2019s government corrupt.", "lang": "en"}
