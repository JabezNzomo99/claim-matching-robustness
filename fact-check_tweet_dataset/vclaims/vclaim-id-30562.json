The image represents a group of protesters burning the Indian National flag in Pakistan, NOT India. In July 2015, this image was published along with a blog titled, \u201cPakistani protesters burn a poster of PM Narendra Modi\u201d. Upon searching for images related to the protest, we found the original photograph clicked by an Associated Press (AP) photographer.\n\nThe caption posted with the image reads, \u201cPakistani protesters burn an Indian flag during a protest in Multan, Pakistan, Thursday, June 11, 2015. Pakistan has reacted angrily to comments made by the Indian prime minister that reportedly acknowledged Indian forces had a role in the war that created Bangladesh, part of Pakistan until 1971 when separatists won independence after a war.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, a four-year-old image from Pakistan was falsely shared as Shaheen Bagh protesters burning the Indian national flag at a demonstration against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).", "lang": "en"}
