(See: VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Viral \u2018disente vs bastos time\u2019 photos MISLEAD; all taken under Duterte administration)\n\nA reverse image search reveals that the bottom photo claimed to be Duterte\u2019s housing project for uniformed officers is actually an architect\u2019s rendering of townhomes in Amberley Subdivision in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. Several real estate websites still list the properties for sale, each valued at P2.17 million.\n\nThere are no reports of Duterte distributing houses in the Cebu subdivision to soldiers.\n\nOn the other hand, the top photo was indeed during the Aquino government's term: a temporary housing community in Barangay Caiba-an in Tacloban, Leyte for victims of Typhoon Yolanda (international name: Haiyan), which devastated parts of the central Philippines in 2013.\n\nThe image was grabbed from a November 2015 GMA News Online article about a documentary on the survivors\u2019 housing situation two years after the typhoon hit.\n\nSOLID Duterte\u2019s misleading post emerged after Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles announced on Aug. 6 the turnover of 1,419 permanent housing units for Yolanda victims in Ormoc City, Leyte.\n\nThe inaccurate post has nearly 3,000 shares and could have reached 323,000 people, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. Its top traffic generators, apart from SOLID Duterte itself, are FB groups PROTECT THE PRESIDENT DUTERTE and SUPPORT and PROTECT the PRESIDENT DUTERTE.\n\nAside from SOLID Duterte, which was created on April 16, two other netizens uploaded their versions of the misleading post on Aug. 17, replacing the phrase \u201cpanahon ng kamay na bakal\u201d with \u201cpanahon ng bastos (rude time).\u201d The two have been shared nearly 800 times.", "lang": "en"}
