The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended in early April that people wear face coverings in public to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nA viral image alleges in a Facebook post that masks had never been used for protection against viruses prior to 2020, saying, \u201cTrying to figure out how masks keep us safe when we never used them before 2020 for any viruses.\u201d (RELATED: Did Florida\u2019s Surgeon General Recommend People Stop Wearing Face Masks?)\n\nBut, contrary to the post\u2019s claim, face masks have previously been used as an infectious disease mitigation strategy. For example, public health officials encouraged \u2013 and even mandated in some U.S. cities \u2013 people to wear masks during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, according to Stanford University.\n\n\u201cNewspapers provided instructions on \u2018How to Make Masks at Home\u2018 and published photographs of masked nurses,\u201d E. Thomas Ewing, a history professor at Virginia Tech, wrote in Health Affairs. \u201cMasks were just one of the \u2018non-pharmaceutical interventions\u2018 or \u2018social distancing\u2018 policies, to use modern terms, adopted to contain the epidemic, along with closing schools, prohibiting public gatherings, and advising changes in personal behavior.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2009-2010 H1N1 flu pandemic, the CDC recommended that individuals sick with or suspected of having the virus and those at high risk for severe illness wear face masks in certain settings. People in Asian countries, particularly those impacted by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, have also worn masks during public health emergencies prior to the emergence of the new coronavirus in late 2019, according to The Atlantic.\n\nAs of press time, there are over 10.7 million confirmed coronavirus cases and some 517,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.", "lang": "en"}
