While Mike Martinez has been on the Austin City Council for nearly eight years and has a near-perfect attendance record, Steve Adler has not, to our knowledge, ever taken an active role in our local government by appearing before Council on an item.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a way to get to \"never.\"\n\nTo be sure, Adler has been running as a City Hall outsider eager to get city government moving in a fresh direction. Wick told us Adler never has been on a council-appointed board or commission.\n\nBut Wick said by email the eminent-domain lawyer has built familiarity with city affairs, in part by representing clients whose land was being condemned by the city. In 2004, Adler represented Lowe\u2019s when the store and city of Austin tried to keep construction of a store continuing in Southwest Austin. The project ultimately proceeded after a 2005 legal settlement involving the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups.\n\nAdler also has volunteered in causes that connected with city government, Wick wrote.\n\nAccording to an October 2014 Austin American-Statesman , Adler led the board of the Austin-area Anti-Defamation League from 2009 to 2012. In that role, Wick told us, Adler \"helped conceive of and serves on the city-led Hate Crimes Task Force.\"\n\nThe Austin ADL says on a that when the task force was launched in December 2010, its \"convenors\" included the ADL, several council members and more than 70 individuals representing 40 organizations or departments.\n\nA May 2011 Austin Chronicle , pointed out by Wick, listed the ADL among groups having a hand in starting the task force. The story described Laura Morrison as one of three council members behind the task force\u2019s creation in the wake of the beatings of two men outside City Hall in 2010. \"The attack prompted Morrison and colleagues Sheryl Cole and Randi Shade to ask the Austin chapter of the Anti-Defam\u00ada\u00adtion League to put together a proposal for what a city-led task force might look like,\" the Chronicle said.\n\nThe story said: \"The idea is for the group \u2013 which includes\" Travis County\u2019s district and county attorneys, the Austin Police Department, \"University of Texas and Austin Independent School District police, members of the Anti-Defam\u00adation League, Out Youth, and other civil rights groups, among others \u2013 to identify and develop an approach to dealing with hate-motivated violence \u2018before, during, and after\u2019 it happens.\"\n\nThat story didn\u2019t mention Adler. But in May 2014, in the Austin Bulldog quoted Austin ADL board member Kirk Rudy saying Adler \"was instrumental\" in creating the task force.\n\nBy phone, attorney Karen Gross, a former ADL staff member, told us she and Adler helped launch the task force by reaching out to any group with a possible stake in the collaboration of city, county and non-governmental entities.\n\nWick said Adler also had a hand in writing the city\u2019s cultural master plan.\n\nAn April 2008 consultant\u2019s lists Adler among 71 members of the CreateAustin Leadership Council, an appointed group of \"civic, business and cultural leaders who agreed to provide the visible leadership in reaching out to engage the community, to assist in crafting the CreateAustin Cultural Master Plan and to galvanize the effort to implement the plan\u2019s recommendations.\"\n\nBy telephone, Janet Seibert, the city\u2019s civic arts program consultant, said the members were chosen by city staff.\n\nThe report says the city\u2019s Cultural Arts Division launched the CreateAustin \"strategic planning process\" in September 2006 because the city \"wanted to review and refine municipal roles and responsibilities for cultural support, but that was only half of it. The City recognized they couldn\u2019t support arts, culture and creative industries alone. They sought to trigger and develop community leadership to explore major issues and develop strategies to sustain the creative culture of Austin.\"\n\nThe leadership council, the report said, \"met regularly to review research, findings and community input in order to help shape the cultural plan.\" Adler, the report says, was on the body\u2019s Cultural Infrastructure task force. Adler co-chaired that task force, Seiberg said to our query. She said the Austin City Council accepted the master plan in June 2010.\n\nMartinez said Adler has \"never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall.\"\n\nAdler hasn\u2019t been a member of city boards or commissions and we accept Martinez\u2019s assertion Adler hasn\u2019t addressed the council. Then again, Adler had a leadership hand in developing the hate crimes task force and the city\u2019s cultural master plan.\n\nAll told, this never/anything statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
