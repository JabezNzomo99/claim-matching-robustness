One hour later, WikiLeaks starts dropping my emails,\" Podesta told Chuck Todd on Dec. 18, 2016. \"One could say that those things might not have been a coincidence.\"\n\nThe Access Hollywood tape Podesta referenced showed Donald Trump making lewd comments about women during a 2005 interview. \"I\u2019ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,\" Trump tells interviewer Billy Bush. \"You know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful \u2014 I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. I just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\"\n\nThe tape was discovered and first published by the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold right around 4 p.m. ET on Oct. 7. Fahrenthold shared a link to his story on Twitter.\n\nLess than an hour later, WikiLeaks revealed that it had received 50,000 of Podesta\u2019s emails. It released 2,050 initially. It, too, shared the news via Twitter.\n\nWe authenticated the time of each tweet using the Twitter source code and this very helpful blog post. We obviously cannot assess if the two events were connected, as Podesta suggested, but on the timeline he\u2019s right on.\n\nHere's how Time described the events in an article published that day.\n\n\"The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post\u2019s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\"\n\nCorrection: WikiLeaks' first post of Twitter was around 4:30 p.m. An earlier version of this fact-check referred to a subsequent tweet.", "lang": "en"}
