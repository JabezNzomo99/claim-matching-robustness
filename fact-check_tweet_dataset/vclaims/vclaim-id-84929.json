The classification of a call sheet therefore is not necessarily fixed, and staffers in the Secretary\u2019s office who are involved in preparing and finalizing these call sheets understand that. Given this context, it appears the markings in the documents raised by the press were no longer necessary or appropriate at the time they were sent.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
