But there\u2019s still a chance she\u2019ll get some competition before the primaries and caucuses start next year.\n\nOne of those potential candidates is Martin O\u2019Malley, who served two terms as governor of Maryland. O\u2019Malley, like Clinton, hasn\u2019t officially announced a bid yet, but he recently traveled to , home of the first-in-the-nation primary, and he sat for an with George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s This Week.\n\nDuring the interview, O\u2019Malley decried the long-term economic fraying of the American dream, saying the United States has had \"12 years in a row of wages declining.\" A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did.\n\nWe turned to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, zeroing in on the annual averages for median, inflation-adjusted, usual, weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers. That sounds like a mouthful -- but when we ran it by two economists, Tara Sinclair of George Washington University and Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution, both said it was the same metric they would have used.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the data between 2002 and 2014:\n\nHere\u2019s where O\u2019Malley has a point: Wages were indeed lower in 2014 than they were 12 years earlier.\n\nBut here\u2019s where his phrasing is misleading: It\u2019s not accurate to say the United States has had \"12 years in a row of wages declining.\"\n\nThis makes it sound like wages dropped, in lockstep, in each of those 12 years. That\u2019s not the case -- as the chart above shows, wages fell in six of the 12 years, rose in four years, and remained steady in two years.\n\nIndeed, over the 12-year period in question, weekly earnings remained in a fairly narrow band -- sometimes rising, sometimes falling, but only deviating by $4 a week over 12 years, a decline of just over 1 percent from where they started in 2002. That\u2019s more accurately described as a sideways trend line than as a steady decline.\n\n\"Gov. O\u2019Malley misspoke or simply was in error,\" Burtless said.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s office did not dispute the data we found. Spokeswoman Lis Smith said O\u2019Malley has previously used a different formulation -- that \"over the last 12 years, wages have been going down, not up.\" He in Iowa recently, for instance. And that wording would have been more accurate than what he said on This Week.\n\nO\u2019Malley said that in the United States, we\u2019ve had \"12 years in a row of wages declining.\"\n\nHe has a point that, using the most appropriate measure of compensation, weekly wages adjusted for inflation are lower now than they were 12 years ago. But they have not fallen consistently and inexorably, as the phrasing of his claim on This Week suggests. We rate the claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
