The young man, who had converted to Islam in 2014, had pledged allegiance to ISIS hoping to become a full-fledged soldier in its war against Western civilization. Instead, he was rapidly turned into a sex slave for ISIS combatants, spending most of his time in captivity chained to a bed, dressed up as a Western-style woman and performing sexual services on ISIS soldiers daily until his recent escape. \"I went there to fight but I guess they had other plans for me,\" he told reporters, visibly ashamed. \"Upon my arrival, they kept pinching my ass, rubbing my nipples across my shirt and whistling at me,\" he said. \"At first, I thought it was all fun and games until I woke up one day chained to a bed, dressed in a robe with makeup and lipstick on my face,\" he recalls in horror.\n\nThe picture used with the story does indeed show Christian Emde, a German ex-protestant who converted to Islam and joined ISIS.
