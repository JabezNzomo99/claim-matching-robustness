On normal days, the protest at Shaheen Bagh starts around 12 pm as confirmed by one of The Logical Indian reporters, who visited the site of the protest. However, the picture taken by Amar Ujala was from an early morning scene when the protestors had not assembled.\n\nAmit Malviya and several others had earlier tried to discredit the Shaheen Bagh movement using similar fake news.\n\nThe Supreme Court is slated to hear the matter of the protesters blocking the public roads and causing inconvenience to people on 17 February. The protesters, however, aren't defiant and say that the apex court's order will be acceptable to them.\n\n\n\nWomen protesting at Shaheen Bagh had earlier sent a defamation notice to Amit Malviya on January 21 for his allegation that the women were paid to protest. The office of advocate Mehmood Pracha had sent the legal notice charging Rs 1 crore for damages and also demanded an apology from Malviya.\n\nTherefore it can be confirmed that the protest has not been called off following AAP's victory in the Delhi assembly elections.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Protesting Women At Shaheen Bagh Send \u20b91 Cr Defamation Notice To BJP IT Cell Chief Amit Malviya", "lang": "en"}
