The link to the homepage of the BBC is attached to the message, which has been reproduced below.\n\nBJP will gain seats and win 2019 Lok Sabha polls says CIA & ISI Survey\u2026*\n\nState.

Another version of the same message begins with the words, \u201c#BBC \u092c\u094d\u0930\u093f\u091f\u093f\u0936 \u091a\u0948\u0928\u0932 \u0928\u0947 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0926\u0940 \u091a\u094c\u0915\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0964\u201d (Shocking information by BBC channel in its survey- translation). It may be noted that the link to the BBC homepage has been attached with the message, in order to make it seem as if this \u2018survey\u2019 was commissioned by the BBC.\n\nSeveral individuals have copy-pasted this message on their timelines on Facebook. It has also found its way to Twitter, although the tweet count is minimal at this stage.\n\nThe message is a total fabrication. No such pre-election survey has been conducted by the BBC. In fact, the broadcaster does not conduct pre-election surveys at all for India. In a statement to Alt News, BBC spokesperson said, \u201cThis fake survey on the Lok Sabha polls has been circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook, with messages claiming it to be from BBC News. We\u2019d like to make it absolutely clear that it is fake and does not come from the BBC. The BBC does not support pre-election surveys in India\u201d.\n\nIn the past as well, prior to the Karnataka assembly election and the Rajasthan assembly poll of 2018, the name and logo of BBC was misused to circulate a fake pre-poll survey showing the ruling party ahead in both states. With the Lok Sabha election about to commence, such fake pre-election surveys are likely to be circulated widely.", "lang": "en"}
