The claim is misleading; the image was taken in the aftermath of a traffic accident in Cambodia in 2019.\n\nThis image of multiple saffron-robed Buddhist monks lying on a roadside was posted on Facebook on September 28, 2019, and has been shared more than 130 times since.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nTranslated to English, the Sinhalese-language text superimposed across the image reads:\n\n\u201cThis is not the work of the Pohottuwa\u2019s patriotic Karuna\n\n\"You slaves, there is not a single individual who harmed our religion in the pohottuwa.\u201d\n\nThe Sinhalese caption reads: \u201cTrue true, the man who committed the highest number of Buddhist monk killings is not with the pohottuwa now.\u201d\n\n\u201cPohottuwa\u201d means flower bud in Sinhalese, and it is the official symbol of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), a political party led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\n\u201cKaruna\u201d refers to Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan, who is also known as Karuna Amman, a former rebel commander of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka\u2019s Eastern province.\n\nMuralitharan has been linked to the Aranthalawa Massacre, in which LTTE militants killed 33 Buddhist monks on a bus in Eastern province on June 2, 1987. The politician denies the accusation.\n\nHaving broken away from LTTE in 2004, Muralitharan, as well as his Tamil National Freedom Front party, is currently supporting Rajapaksa\u2019s party.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the image used in the post shows casualties of a road accident in Cambodia in 2019, not the killings of Buddhist monks.\n\nA reverse image search on Google led to this photo published on the website of the Cambodian Police on June 30, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the Cambodian police\u2019s website:\n\nAccording to a Cambodian police report, on June 30, 2019, a truck slammed into a tuk tuk transporting several young Buddhist monks on a road in Koh Kong province, killing a man and injuring five monks.\n\nThe same picture was also published in this July 1, 2019, article by the Khmer Times, a Phnom Penh-based English-language publication.\n\nThe article is headlined: \u201cMonks injured and killed in fatal Koh Kong traffic accident\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparing the image in the misleading post image (L) and the photo in the Khmer Times (R):", "lang": "en"}
