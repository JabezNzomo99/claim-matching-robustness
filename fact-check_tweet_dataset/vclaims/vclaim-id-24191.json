The law applies to poor, deserving students from 15 to 25 years old.\n\nThe ad neglects to mention that RA 9547 amended RA 7323 which created SPES in 1992, giving the impression the program was new.\n\nEstrada himself said in a Senate press release in 2010:\n\nSPES is an excellent legislation but it needed improvements so I personally pushed for the adoption of such improvements on the old law to make it more effective and relevant to present and future conditions as well as to increase the number of students and employers that could benefit from the program.\n\nAmong the amendments the Partido ng Masang Pilipino Senate bet introduced to the old law are (1) granting academic credits to students employed in jobs related to their course, as stated in his campaign ad; (2) expanding employers' participation by lowering the required minimum number of their workers from 50 to ten; (3) setting a fixed maximum period for employment of students and (4) requiring employers to inform students of their rights, privileges and benefits as workers.\n\nAt the time Estrada\u2019s bill was approved on second reading, a total 984,840 students had already benefited from SPES since 1995, according to a 2008 press release from the Senate.\n\nHis May 2 ad refers to 164,246 beneficiaries, an information it attributes to the Official Gazette, which compiles laws and other government issuances. \u2014 Lyra Lucero, Alyassa Lagua and UP Journalism Department\n\nOfficial Gazette.
