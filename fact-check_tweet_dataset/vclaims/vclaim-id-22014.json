He was apparently slapped by the chief guest and Vedic scholar Swami Vidyanand Videh, who objected to Nehru\u2019s remark and retorted that Aryans are the original inhabitants of Bharat and that it is Nehru who has Arab blood in his veins. It is further mentioned that the same is cited in a book penned by the swami.\n\nThe photo and the message with identical text were posted by several individual users on Facebook in 2019.\n\nThe same has been shared on Twitter. Alt News also found the same text in a blog published in 2016.\n\nThe social media claim which accompanies the photograph is false. Alt News had earlier fact-checked this photograph of Jawaharlal Nehru, wherein he appears to be restrained by being held from the back, when it was circulated with a false narrative referring to 1962 and the Sino-Indian war.\n\nWhile it is true that this photograph is from 1962, it is in no way related to the Sino-Indian war or its political aftershocks. Reverse-searching the image on Google, Alt News found that it had appeared in an article in Outlook magazine published in 2014. The photograph was captioned, \u2018Braced for the worst: Nehru is prevented from plunging into a riotous crowd in 1962, before the war\u2019. The image was credited to Associated Press (AP).\n\nSearching the Associated Press archives with the key words \u2018Nehru 1962\u2019, Alt News found the picture and also the correct narrative describing it \u2013 \u201cA security man grabbed Indian Prime Minister Nehru to keep him from plunging into a riotous crowd at a meeting of the Congress Party in Patna, India, January 1962. Later in the year, Communist China\u2019s attack on India plunged Nehru into new troubles.\u201d This implies that the photograph was taken before the Indo-Sino war in 1962.\n\nAlt News looked at newspaper reports of January 1962, and found that the photograph was clicked at the Congress session in Patna, which was held in January, 1962. The crowd at the plenary session had swelled, and as it moved closer to the dais to get a glimpse of the Prime Minister, pandemonium broke out, resulting in a stampede. The photograph was clicked at the moment when Nehru, in \u201cpersonal effort to restore order\u201d, was restrained by security personnel from plunging into the crowd.\n\nMoreover, Alt News found no trace of the references cited in the message, two books named \u0935\u093f\u0926\u0947\u0939 \u0917\u093e\u0925\u093e: \u090f\u0915 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0938\u0902\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0921\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0940 and \u0928\u0947\u0939\u0930\u0942 : \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928 \u0914\u0930 \u092a\u0924\u0928.\n\nAlt News had fact-checked this image earlier, when it was shared with the false narrative of Nehru thrashed by a mob after failure in the 1962 war. It is noteworthy that the photograph was clicked in January 1962, whereas the Sino-Indian war broke out in October that year. The same image has been circulated with one more false narrative- of Nehru arrested in Kashmir in 1946 as he attempted to enter without a visa.", "lang": "en"}
