It is being claimed that the video was shot in Delhi\u2019s Dhaula Kuan area and the lions came out amid the ongoing lockdown because of the Coronavirus spread.\n\nThe caption of the video read: \u201cDelhi cantt\n\n Dhaula kuan\n\n \ud83d\ude33lockdown ka asar\u201d\n\nThe video is being widely shared. Several posts can be seen here, here, here and here.\n\nALSO READ: Rahul Gandhi did not trip in this picture; here\u2019s the truth\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to the video is false.\n\nWe extracted keyframes of the video and put them through Reverse Image Search. We found the same video posted on a Facebook page Gir India Asiatic lion dated May 10, 2020. According to the caption, the video was from Gir National Park during the nationwide lockdown.\n\nThe caption read: \u201cA amazing video from Gir national park (Gujarat India)\n\n Lion pride roaming in Lockdown at Pipavav port road in day\n\n Two lioness with four cute cubs\u201d\n\nTaking a cue from the above claim, we did a search with keywords such as \u2018Gir national park\u2019, \u2018lions\u2019, \u2018Cub\u2019 which led us to another similar video on YouTube from Gir Forest, dated January 11, 2016, in which a lioness and her cubs can be seen walking on a road.\n\nThough, its not the same video as the one in the question, however, when we juxtaposed both the videos and closely analysed them, we came to the conclusion that location of both the videos is same (Gir National park).\n\nWe compared both the videos frame-by-frame and found a few common elements, which helped us establish the fact that the video in question is from Gir National Park in Gujarat.\n\nHowever, NewsMobile independently cannot verify the timeline of the video. But, the above information establishes that the video in question is NOT from Delhi\u2019s Dhaula Kuan.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
