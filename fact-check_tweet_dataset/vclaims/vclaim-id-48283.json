This was announced by the French Prime Minister on 15 April. The French government says this will be for all staff who manage the Covid-19 crisis in the hospitals of the departments most affected, as well as to staff in less affected departments who have received Covid-19 patients. All the other hospital staff who don\u2019t benefit from the maximum rate will receive \u20ac500 (\u00a3440). Staff working overtime in hospitals will also be paid more than usual.\n\nSome other workers will get some kind of bonus too, including state civil servants.", "lang": "en"}
