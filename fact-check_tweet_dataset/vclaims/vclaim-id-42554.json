Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: PM Modi is providing free masks to people under \u2018Swachh Bharat Mission\u2019 to keep them protected from Coronavirus outbreak. Fact: The website in the post is a dubious one and there is no government scheme of PM Modi under which free masks are being provided to people. The Press Information Bureau (PIB) has also clarified that there is no Central government scheme that provides free masks to people to keep them protected from Coronavirus outbreak. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the link (www.narendrmodiawasyojna.in/?m=1) in the post is opened, it is directed to a page. The website address (domain) of this website is different from the website domain of government sites which end in \u2018gov.in\u2019 or \u2018nic.in\u2019. Also, the name of PM \u2018Narendra Modi\u2019 is written as \u2018Narendr Modi\u2019. \n\n\n\nWhen clicked on the \u2018Order Now\u2019 option, irrespective of filling up of details, it is directed to a blog and it shows the message \u2018Blog has been removed\u2019.\n\nIn the post, it was written that the masks are being provided under the \u2018Swachh Bharath Mission\u2019, but there is no mention of it on the website of \u2018Swachh Bharath\u2019.\n\nThe Press Information Bureau (PIB) has also debunked the message and clarified that there is no central government scheme that provides free masks to people to keep them protected from the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe same website address is also being shared (archived) on social media in the name of \u2018Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana\u2019 (a housing scheme of Central Government). If the posted link address is observed carefully, it can be seen that it mentions \u2018Awas Yojana\u2019 i.e. housing scheme. But, as discussed above, it is a dubious website.\n\nTo conclude, there is no central government scheme that provides free masks to people to keep them protected from the Coronavirus outbreak. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
