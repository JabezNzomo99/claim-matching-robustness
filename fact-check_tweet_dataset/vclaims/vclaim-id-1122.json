Biden\u2019s shows a near empty gym with participants observing social distancing guidelines, while Trump\u2019s alleged rally features a large crowd. The photograph used for Trump\u2019s rally actually shows a separate Washington D.C. event in 2019.\n\nAn example of the post is visible here .\n\nThe photograph used to show Biden\u2019s campaign event at a community center in Darby, Pennsylvania, is authentic. Reuters coverage shows similar social distancing measures in place ( reut.rs/3hRYpcR ). Trump tweeted the exact photograph visible in the claim ( here ).\n\nBiden spoke to a very small audience near Philadelphia on June 17, where he criticized the President\u2019s actions regarding the coronavirus pandemic ( here ).\n\nThe photograph used to show Trump\u2019s rally was recently fact-checked by Reuters ( here ). It does not show Trump\u2019s recent rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20. The image actually shows a crowd at the Pentagon Library parking lot in Arlington, Virginia on May 26, 2019, during the Rolling Thunder Washington D.C. First Amendment Demonstration Run (Arlington is part of the Washington D.C, metro area. The photograph was taken just across the Potomac river from D.C., near the Pentagon.)\n\nA similar angle of the image in the claim is visible here (see blue tent). A slightly different angle of the scene is visible here and here (see white Jeep). The location of the scene, officially in Arlington, Virginia, is visible on Google maps here ( bit.ly/2NogZes ). Videos of the scene are visible here and here .\n\nFor more than three decades, thousands of bikers have gathered in the Pentagon parking lot on Memorial Weekend for the Rolling Thunder run \u2013 a motorcycle procession that started as a tribute to fallen and missing-in action soldiers. Reuters footage of the event is visible here and here .\n\nOn June 20, President Donald Trump addressed a less-than-full arena in Tulsa, Oklahoma for his first re-election campaign rally in months ( here ). Reuters photos of the rally can be seen here . Aerial footage of the rally venue and surrounding areas is visible here .\n\nPartly false. While Biden\u2019s event did observe social distancing and low attendance, the photograph used to show Trump\u2019s rally is actually from a D.C. event in 2019.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
