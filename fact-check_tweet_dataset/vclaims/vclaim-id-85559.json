Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, and state and local law enforcement can decide the extent to which they want to cooperate with the federal government on immigration enforcement.\n\nThere is limited research on the effect of sanctuary policies on crime. The research that does exist found no statistically significant impact of sanctuary policies on crime or showed that immigrant-friendly policing strategies reduced crime in some jurisdictions. Sanctuary jurisdictions release inmates after their criminal case is complete, and extensive research shows noncitizens are not more prone to criminality than U.S.-born citizens. Moreover, some sanctuary jurisdictions do cooperate with the federal government if they believe the inmate is a public safety threat.\n\nFrom 3 p.m. Friday, June 30, to 6 a.m. Wednesday, July 5, more than 100 people were shot in Chicago, and at least 15 of the victims died. Nearly half of the shootings occurred in the last 12 hours of the long holiday, according to the Chicago Tribune\u2019s analysis. Many of the shootings involved gang-related activity. And much of the violence in the last 12 hours of the holiday involved petty disputes in which arguments escalated into shootings, particularly among people who were drinking all day.\n\nBut illegal immigration is not a contributing factor, according to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson: \u201cI have been a police officer for more than 30 years and the federal government\u2019s plans will hamper community policing and undermine the work our men and women have done \u2026 Undocumented immigrants are not driving violence in Chicago, and that\u2019s why I want our officers focused on community policing and not trying to be the immigration police.\u201d\n\nBecause Chicago fails to identify suspects in the majority of its killings, it is impossible to know exactly how many are committed by illegal immigrants, O\u2019Malley said: \u201cAnd Chicago\u2019s unwillingness to share data regarding the citizenship of offenders in its custody further muddles the issue. Reversing sanctuary city policies is about more than just enforcing federal immigration law by detaining criminals here illegally \u2014 it\u2019s about reestablishing a culture of law and order, where crimes are punished and people are deterred from committing them.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s no evidence that it had anything to do with the city\u2019s decision to reverse its sanctuary policy in early 2017. In fact, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gim\u00e9nez explained to Sessions after the speech that the county has worked hard to decrease its crime rate using new tactics and neighborhood-based crime-prevention efforts, such as creating job-training programs for high-crime areas, said Michael Hern\u00e1ndez, spokesman for the mayor.\n\n\u201cMayor Gim\u00e9nez explained to the attorney general that we can\u2019t attribute the drop in crime just to a policy change that took place earlier this year. We have to look at it holistically,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cWe strongly believe that it is because we have the best law enforcement agency in the Southeastern United States \u2014 the Miami-Dade Police Department.\u201d\n\nThis is a complicated topic, but the answer is quite simple: There is no evidence to back up Sessions\u2019s claim that Miami-Dade\u2019s crime went down because it reversed its sanctuary policies, or that Chicago\u2019s crime went up because of its sanctuary policies. He offers a specific example from the 2017 Fourth of July weekend: the number of shooting deaths in Chicago compared with the lack of shooting deaths in Miami-Dade. But this is a red herring \u2014 and a nonsense comparison \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make a point one way or another about sanctuary policies or the crime trends in either city.", "lang": "en"}
