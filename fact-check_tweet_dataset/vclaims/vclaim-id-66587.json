Rick Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., expressed concern about entrepreneurialism in the United States.\n\n\"For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting,\" Rubio said at the June 2, 2015, event.\n\nIs that correct? We took a closer look.\n\nWe located a by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, titled, \"Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros.\"\n\nIn that report, coauthors Robert Litan and Ian Hathaway published data that supports Rubio\u2019s claim. Their calculations come from a collection of U.S. Census Bureau data called Business Dynamics Statistics.\n\n\"Recent evidence points to a U.S. economy that has steadily become less dynamic over time,\" they wrote.\n\nThey found that the rate of business failures held steady, except for an uptick during the Great Recession -- but they also found that the entry rate of new firms declined by nearly half between 1978 and 2011. \"The precipitous drop since 2006 is both noteworthy and disturbing,\" the authors wrote.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker from the report: \"Business deaths now exceed business births for the first time in the 30-plus-year history of our data,\" the authors wrote.\n\nTechnically, the crossover point occurred in 2008, so it\u2019s not as if this happened in the past year or two. Still, we checked with Litan to make sure Rubio wasn\u2019t twisting the statistic in any way, and Litan responded that Rubio\u2019s claim is accurate.\n\n\"It\u2019s true,\" Litan told PolitiFact, adding, \"We haven\u2019t reversed this yet.\"\n\nAs for the causes, the authors of the Brookings report acknowledged being uncertain themselves. However, the report added, \"it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy -- whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones.\"\n\nRubio said that \"for the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting.\" The change didn\u2019t happen in the past year or two -- it occurred in 2008 -- but in general, Rubio has accurately cited a statistic from a respected think tank\u2019s report. The co-author of that report said he feels Rubio has stated the claim accurately. We rate Rubio\u2019s claim True.", "lang": "en"}
