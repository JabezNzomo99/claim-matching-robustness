Visible in the background is a red building branded with the logo \u201cMegabox\u201d.\n\nThe location of the MegaBox shopping centre is Enterprise Square Five 38 Wang Chiu Road, Kowloon Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The only MegaBox shopping centre on record is in Hong Kong, with no record of a MegaBox shopping centre in Wuhan, China.\n\nAAP FactCheck used Google Street View to determine where the video was taken from and found the location to be at, or close to, 11 Sheng Yuet Rd, Kowloon, Hong Kong.\n\nThe 2019 Hong Kong protests erupted in response to a proposed extradition law that could have seen the transfer of fugitives from the semi autonomous region to mainland China.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s \u2018smart\u2019 lamp posts have been controversial since their rollout in June 2019. The lamp posts are being used to support the 5G network on the island among other things. Protesters, however, are pulling them down because they believe the posts house cameras that could feed facial recognition software, not over fears related to the roll out of a 5G network.\n\nThe incident filmed did not occur in 2020 but in fact happened in August, 2019, as evidenced by video and photography from two more sources.\n\nA photo from Getty Images photographer Anthony Kwan shows the same lamp post being pulled down in close proximity to a building branded with an \u201cExchange Tower\u201d logo. The Exchange Tower building is visible to the left of 11 Sheng Yuet rd, Kowloon, in Google Street View.\n\nThe caption of Kwan\u2019s photo reads: \u201cProtesters attempt to pull down a smart lamp post during an anti-government rally in Kowloon Bay district on August 24, 2019 in Hong Kong, China\u201d.\n\nA video published by The Guardian on August 26 uses some of the exact same footage showing protesters spraying the lamp post with an unidentified substance. The Guardian video is titled \u201cHong Kong: anti-surveillance protesters tear down \u2018smart\u2019 lamp post\u201d and was uploaded on August 26, 2019.\n\nOn December 31 2019 the World Health Organization was informed that pneumonia of an unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, China. The culprit would later be identified as the new coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 infection, placing the beginning of the outbreak of the potentially deadly disease months after Hong Kong protesters felled \u2018smart\u2019 lamp posts around the semi autonomous region.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the post to be false. The video does not show protesters in Wuhan pulling down 5G towers, rather protesters in Hong Kong pulling down \u2018smart\u2019 lamp posts well before the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was discovered. False \u2013 The implications of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
