While there is no evidence this appeared in Obama\u2019s yearbook as implied in some posts, something similar to this quote was written by Obama while at Harvard.\n\nThe quote is a misinterpretation of words written in 1991 by Obama and Robert Fisher, a fellow schoolmate, in an unpublished Harvard paper titled \u201cRace and Rights Rhetoric\u201d.\n\nThe reference to Trump gained attention after the publication of the book Rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama by David J. Garrow ( here ). While discussing the paper which according to him was intended to be part of a book manuscript, Garrow included the following excerpt from \u201cRace and Rights Rhetoric\u201d in his book:\n\n\u201c[Americans have] a continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility, values that extend far beyond the issue of race in the American mind. The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American\u2014I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don\u2019t make it, my children will.\u201d\n\nObama and Fisher did not write that Trump was the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d but mentioned him as an example of success or wealth. In context, they write that the economic status exemplified by Trump is hoped for with \u201cunfounded optimism\u201d by the average American.\n\nAccording to Garrow, Obama and Fisher argued in their paper that \u201crights rhetoric\u201d had \u201cimpeded, rather than facilitated\u201d the achievement of \u201cblack empowerment\u201d and made a call for African-Americans to \u201cgrasp the pragmatic need for a shift away from the rights rhetoric and towards the language of opportunity\u201d.\n\nWhen asked about the misattributed quote, Garrow told Reuters via email this is a perpetuated error, noting it is \u201chard to erase falsehoods from the record\u201d. He added: \u201cOnce a falsehood gets out there on the web, it takes on an independent life as the very nature of the web discourages people from checking for reliable sources.\u201d\n\nThe misleading quote may have stemmed from the headlines of several media outlets that reported on Garrow\u2019s book and the paper\u2019s excerpt. According to Snopes here , some outlets misleadingly implied in their headlines that Obama called Trump the American Dream, while clarifying the reference to Trump in the body of their articles.\n\nPartly false. Barack Obama did not say Donald Trump is the American Dream. Obama mentioned Trump in an unpublished Harvard paper titled \u201cRace and Rights Rhetoric\u201d to exemplify the economic status that the average American hopes for with \u201cunfounded optimism\u201d.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
