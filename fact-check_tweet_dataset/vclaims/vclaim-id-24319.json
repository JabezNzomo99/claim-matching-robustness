Satanists end their prayers by saying \u2018Lucifer our Lord\u2019, in short, \u2018LOL\u2019. Every time you type \u2018LOL\u2019 you are endorsing Satan. Do not use \u2018LOL\u2019 ever again! Keep Satan out of your life. Share this advice to Christians.\u201d\n\nFirst used for \u2018laughing out loud\u2019 in 1989\n\nBut LOL has been used as a short version of \u201claughing out loud\u201d for decades, since the 1980s. There\u2019s plenty of proof of that \u2013 and zero proof that typing LOL when you think something\u2019s funny means you\u2019re \u201cendorsing Satan\u201d.\n\nfor \u201claughing out loud\u201d to 1989.

Some say it also means \u201clots of love\u201d, but none includes the definition \u201cLucifer our lord\u201d.\n\n\u2018Appeared out of the ether\u2019\n\nSo where did the hoax come from?\n\nThe meme seems to have started\n\nin about 2012. It was quickly\n\nin the US, as well as by fact-checkers\n\nthe hoax \u201cappeared out of the ether in November 2012\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo mention of such a connotation predated the rumour\u2019s first appearance, and documentation of the term\u2019s generally accepted meaning of \u2018laughing out loud\u2019 is extensive both on the internet and among linguists who have studied the usage of internet slang.\u201d\n\nSnopes points out that Oxford\u2019s researchers had thoroughly researched the origins of LOL before it was added to their dictionary.\n\n\u201cHad the \u2018Lucifer\u2019 variation legitimate been an (even partial or marginal) root, it would have shown up in the extensive research done on the etymology of LOL prior to 2011.\u201d \u2013", "lang": "en"}
