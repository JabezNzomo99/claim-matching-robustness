Annie Raja is also a CPI activist and is the wife of communist leader D Raja.\n\nBOOM reached out to Raja who rubbished claims of being a student of JNU.\n\n\u201cOf course I am a student, but not of JNU. I was detained by the police when we were staging demonstrations against the CJI in the sexual harassment case in May this year. This has got nothing to do with the ongoing JNU protests,\u201d Annie Raja said.\n\nThe students of JNU were lathi-charged by Delhi Police on November 18, when they were marching towards the parliament with their demands of rolling back the hostel fee hike. Several students were injured during the face-off with the Delhi police.", "lang": "en"}
