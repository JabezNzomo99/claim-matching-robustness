This post is not about the science behind such claims, but instead about the business of selling supplements with fake celebrity endorsements. For the record, no keto-based product has ever been pitched or funded on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d\n\nIn at least one notable instance, a product named \u201cPureFit KETO\u201d was marketed as if it had been successfully pitched on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d However, on June 22, 2019, the Better Business Bureau investigated the company, finding \u201cthat the images appearing on PureFit KETO\u2019s website were taken from a separate \u2018Shark Tank\u2019 episode that does not mention PureFit KETO.\u201d Despite this, Amazon, among others, includes the \u201cShark Tank\u201d claim in its product listing at the time of this reporting in late 2019.\n\nClaims of a \u201cShark Tank\u201d approved \u201cketo pill\u201d are just one of a series of iterations of a broader scam. Among the many ways some people seek \u201cpassive income\u201d from online marketing is to sell supplements via dropshipping \u2014 a practice in which the person advertising and selling a given product never actually has physical possession of the product in question. The role of the dropshipper is to move the product by directing potential customers to order directly from a supplier and thereby earning a fraction of the profits from a sale in the process. Myriad individuals in this space evidently use a variety of dubious practices to juice those sales.\n\nOne such method is to lie about who has endorsed the product, as evidenced in claims that \u201cPureFit Keto\u201d had been funded on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d Similar products have also been advertised as if famous celebrities use them. For example, marketers of a product named \u201cKeto Fit\u201d claimed the supplement was endorsed by model Chrissy Teigen, providing made-up quotes from her to sell the product. Teigen publicly repudiated the practice when it was brought to her attention in January 2019:\n\nClaims of Keto Fit\u2019s celebrity endorsements don\u2019t end with Teigen. False claims about Keto Fit\u2019s endorsements include alleged support from celebrities such as Demi Lovato and Jameela Jamil. In some cases, claims of support come from websites designed to look like existing media properties \u2014 the Teigen claims were made on a website pretending to be the popular site Bored Panda. In other cases, a common marketing method is the creation of fake diet pill reviews on blogs that exist solely to review that one keto product while highlighting impossible-to-miss links to order the product.\n\nThough these various keto products often change names \u2014 the products are frequently \u201crebranded\u201d into similar-sounding names over time \u2014 the product generally remains the same. These products, with names like KetoFit, KetoBurn, KetoPlus, or KetoMelt, are all \u2014 if you trust these companies to accurately report their contents \u2014 made up of the same chemical: Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB).\n\nBHB is a ketone that the body is able under certain circumstances to burn for energy instead of glucose. Suggesting this widely available nutritional supplement is uniquely worthy to be an invention worthy of \u201cShark Tank,\u201d or a secret product used by the Hollywood elite is, on its face, absurd. More to the point, however, no keto diet pill has ever been discussed on the show \u201cShark Tank.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
