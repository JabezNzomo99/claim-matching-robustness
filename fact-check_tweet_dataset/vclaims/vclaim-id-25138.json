The page Acche Din has a following of over 13 million. The message has also been shared by individual users on Facebook.\n\nExpectedly, this claim has also found its way to Twitter.\n\nIn conversation with Alt News, Asaduddin Owaisi said, \u201cThis is an absolute lie. It is the work of trolls. You may refer to my response to (SP leader) Azam Khan over the Dadri issue, when I had raised objection over him taking the issue to the United Nations. I have recently criticised (Pakistan PM) Imran Khan over his statement on minorities in India. There is no question of my having written such a letter to the UN.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Asaduddin Owaisi had lashed out at SP leader Azam Khan after the latter had written a letter to the then UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, seeking intervention after the Dadri lynching episode in which Mohammad Akhlaq was killed on suspicion of having slaughtered a calf. Owaisi had reportedly said, \u201cAzam has committed a blunder by taking up India\u2019s internal issue with the UN. It is supposed to be solved within the country.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
