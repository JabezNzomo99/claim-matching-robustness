Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.\n\nClaim: The girl in the photo was holding a poster criticizing the \u2018Shaadi Shagun\u2019 scheme. Fact: No, the girl was not holding a poster criticizing the \u2018Shaadi Shagun\u2019 scheme. The photo was taken in 2014 and the scheme was announced in 2017. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the image in the post was run through Google Reverse Image, it was found to be uploaded by a Facebook page called \u2018Speaking Frame\u2019 back in 2014 in an album with the title \u201cBefore judging US, JUDGE yourself!\u201d. In the original photo, the girl was holding a poster which reads, \u201cIf a girl is in LOVE, it\u2019s natural and it does not make her CHARACTERLESS\u201d.\n\nAlso, when looked for the scheme \u2018Shaadi Shagun\u2019 on Google, it was found that the scheme was announced in 2017. The official press release of the government also mentions this in 2017. So, it is clear that the girl\u2019s photo was taken in 2014, much before the announcement of this scheme.\n\nTo sum it up, the girl in the photo was not holding a poster criticizing the \u2018Shaadi Shagun\u2019 scheme.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
