For instance, the screenshot posted below is of a fake account of Moitra(@moitra_mahua). This account has close to 6000 followers, and among those who follow it include TMC MP Derek O\u2019Brien and journalist Sankarshan Thakur. The account clearly impersonates the TMC MP by suggesting that it belongs to her.\n\nThe official Twitter account of Mahua Moitra is @MahuaMoitra. This was confirmed to Alt News by Moitra herself who said, \u201cI have only one official account, which is @MahuaMoitra.\u201d The same is clearly mentioned in the Bio section of the account. A screenshot of her official account is posted below.\n\nTwitter\u2019s policy on parody/newsfeed/commentary/fan accounts categorically states that users are allowed to create these, provided they follow certain guidelines, such as unambiguous mention in the Bio section and the account name, that the said account is not affiliated with the subject of the account, and that it is a parody and/or fan account.\n\nWhile one of the accounts states that it is a parody account of Ms. Moitra, two others have referred to the accounts as fan accounts. It may be noted that the account @Moitra_Mahuaadded the \u2018parody\u2019 disclaimer only at the time of writing this article. Among those deceived by this handle include Zee News anchor Sudhir Chaudhary and Business Line.\n\nIt may be noted that the official Twitter handle of TMC MP Mahua Moitra is @MahuaMoitra. All other accounts are mere impersonations.", "lang": "en"}
