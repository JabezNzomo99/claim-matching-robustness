It's \u00a346 billion of money I can't spend or nor can anybody else spend on all those goodies that some people think are in the Labour manifesto. We have to live within our means.\"\n\nThat\u2019s about how much the government spent on debt interest in 2015/16. Gross interest payments on central government debt came to about \u00a345 billion and will have been a projected \u00a348 billion for 2016/17, according to the Treasury.\n\nThe government effectively paid some of that to itself. Almost a quarter of government debt is owned by the Bank of England, which pays the profit back to the Treasury.\n\nIgnoring interest payments to Bank of England, the government spent \u00a333 billion in debt interest in 2015/16, with estimates of \u00a336 billion and \u00a342 billion for the following couple of years, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.\n\nIn isolation, those can just look like big meaningless numbers. It helps to look at it in the light of total government spending (of which net debt interest is about 5%) or the size of the economy (2.5%).\n\nThere are lots of ways to slice up government spending. One way is to divide it up according to the different functions of a government, using a method devised by the United Nations. From that angle, debt interest is indeed the fifth biggest item, after spending on health (\u00a3139 billion), benefits and tax credits (\u00a3125 billion), pensions (\u00a3110 billion), and education (\u00a384 billion).\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown we made earlier. It uses Treasury figures for 2015/16, when net debt interest was at a similar level to defence spending. But as they show, it\u2019s not correct that we spend more on interest than on education\u2014we spend over twice as much on that.", "lang": "en"}
