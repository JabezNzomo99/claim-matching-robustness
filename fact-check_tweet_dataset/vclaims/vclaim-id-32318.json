So, we wondered: Did this really happen? In the context of the possible pandemic, it seemed to be an alarming figure.\n\nMurphy\u2019s staff said the source of its information was a Washington Post article from early 2018. That article said, \u201cThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is dramatically downsizing its epidemic prevention activities in 39 out of 49 countries because money is running out.\u201d Similar articles appeared in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal at about the same time, all of which said the administration was planning to scale back or end activities in 39 out of 49 countries.\n\nMurphy\u2019s staff did not explain why his numbers were slightly different. Nor did they explain why they were relying on an article from 2018 when, presumably, a senator or his staff could quickly find out whether the funding reductions occurred.\n\nAt issue was an initiative called the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), which sought to help countries prepare to detect and respond to infectious diseases. The U.S. contribution was largely funded by a supplemental package passed in 2015 after the Ebola crisis that provided about $600 million to the CDC for global-health security work \u2014 and the money was running out.\n\nBrandon Ball, senior lead for congressional relations at PATH, a global health technology nonprofit group, tracked down the numbers for The Fact Checker. The fear in early 2018 was that there would be only a $58.2 million appropriation at a time when the supplemental was running low on funds. But then lawmakers, within weeks, nearly doubled the appropriation.\n\n\u201cFortunately, because of a variety of factors \u2014 including PATH\u2019s advocacy and congressional education work and that of the consortium [backing the GHSA] \u2014 we have seen the overall dollar amount move closer to the level that would mitigate what was being written about in 2018,\u201d Ball said. \u201cHowever, the job isn\u2019t nearly done as covid-19 is demonstrating, which is why we are still advocating and [the CDC] is still working.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that it still up and running,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cWe were concerned it was on the chopping block. The good news is that global health security programs have seen their numbers go up.\u201d\n\nAs we noted, the administration\u2019s 2021 budget request called for an increase in the annual appropriation for global public health protection. The budget notes the commitment to the GHSA represented by the five-year supplemental passed in 2015. \u201cTo ensure these successes continue their trajectory and maintain momentum, the administration has affirmed its commitment to strengthening global health security and fully supports the next phase, GHSA 2024,\u201d the document says.\n\nThe CDC says it provides direct financial support and technical assistance from CDC staff to 17 \u201cPhase 1\u201d countries and technical assistance to 14 \u201cPhase 2\u201d countries and CARICOM, an organization of 15 Caribbean countries and dependencies. An additional eight countries are listed as Ebola Preparedness Countries. That adds up to more than 49, but CDC documents refer to 49 countries. There has been no change to how CDC describes the program or the countries served by it between 2017 and today.\n\nMurphy jumped to conclusions, assuming the funding reductions had gone into effect and the programs in nearly 40 countries were closed. But that\u2019s not correct. Advocacy groups and congressional officials jumped into action. The Trump administration backed off and now appears to fully support GHSA. The recent news reports cited above more accurately said that the administration had sought these cuts, without mentioning that they did not go into effect.", "lang": "en"}
