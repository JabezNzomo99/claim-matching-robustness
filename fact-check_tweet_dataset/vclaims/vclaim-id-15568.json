I was taught Biology and Chemistry by Indian teachers in my secondary school days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are surplus in their country. We have a surplus in the medical profession in our country. I can tell you this. It is my area, we have excess. We have enough, more than enough, quote me.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, it is his area, for the Minister is a medical doctor, although it is difficult to say when last he saw a stethoscope!\n\nTo verify Mr Ngige\u2019s claim, Dubawa contacted him on telephone for evidence to back his claim. He, however, did not respond to calls and text messages sent to him on this subject matter.\n\nFOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING, DEFINITION OF \u2018SURPLUS\u2019\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, surplus is defined as \u201cthe amount that remains when use or need is satisfied.\u201d Another online dictionary, English Oxford Living Dictionary defines surplus as \u201can amount of something left over when requirements have been met; an excess of production or supply.\u201d\n\nIn recent times, Nigerian doctors have been migrating to Canada, United States of America, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom and many other nations across the globe, in search of greener pastures.\n\nWhile many Nigerians will readily agree that Nigeria is experiencing a shortage of doctors in most of its hospitals, the Minister of Labour and Employment says Nigeria has surplus doctors.\n\nAccording to the latest United Nations estimates (as at April 24, 2019), the population of Nigeria is 199,961,971. This is roughly 2.6% of the total world population.\n\nThe Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) data of December 2017, which is the most recent shows that Nigeria had 42,845 registered doctors, dentists and alternative medicine practitioners working in the country. Of these number, 39,912 are medical doctors.\n\nWHO\u2019s ratio of doctor to patient is one doctor to 600 patients.\n\nBased on WHO\u2019s recommendation, Nigeria is expected to have 333,270 medical doctors.\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT THE DOCTORS\u2019 PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION SAYS:\n\nAdedayo Faduyile, the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) President was surprised at the Minister\u2019s statement. Nigeria, he confirms, suffers from an acute shortage of doctors.\n\n\u201cThat is an unfortunate statement which shows that he has done nothing in medical practice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organisation stated that, for optimal healthcare to be achieved, we need doctor/patient ratio of one to 600. In Nigeria, we have 40,000 doctors taking care of 200 million people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, we do not have enough doctors. Maybe he is looking at the monetary part, but there is opportunity cost. We have the maternal mortality that is about the highest in the world. To correct it, we need health professionals around.\u201d\n\nFrom available facts, Nigeria does not have surplus doctors as claimed by Dr. Ngige. The country has a long way to go if the country is to meet the recommendation of WHO on doctor-patient ratio. Therefore, Dr. Chris Ngige\u2019s claim that Nigeria has surplus doctors is totally false.\n\nIt is also clear that the shortage of medical doctors in Nigeria has serious consequences not only for infant and maternal mortality but also the general health of the citizens.", "lang": "en"}
