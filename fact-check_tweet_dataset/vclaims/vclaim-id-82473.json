He whose grandfather was ashamed of being Hindu, can never accept Hindutva in his heart- translation).\n\nThe above message has been shared in the aftermath of speculation that Congress President Rahul Gandhi may contest from Wayanad, Kerala in the upcoming Lok Sabha election. It has been shared along with a video which shows green-coloured flags bearing a crescent, waved in a street rally. The video is 24 seconds long. The logo of News18 can be seen on the top right corner of the video clip.\n\nThe above post is by Nation Wants Namo, a Facebook page with over 230,000 followers, and has been shared over 4300 times so far. The video has been watermarked with the words, \u201cWayanad welcomes Congress\u2019 decision with Islamic flags (translated from Hindi).\n\nThe video has spread like wild fire on Twitter and Facebook. The video has also been shared with an alternate caption in English which reads,\n\nRahul to fight elections in Wayanad , Kerala. Look who is celebrating in Wayanad waving Pakistan flags. Now you know why Congress selected this constituency. The video has also been shared with the message in Telugu.\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook with the Hindi text.\n\nThe message has been shared widely on WhatsApp too.\n\nIUML FLAG, NOT THE FLAG OF PAKISTAN\n\nThe green-coloured flags seen in the video represent the banner of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). IUML is a political party based in Kerala. Its banner is visibly different from the national flag of Pakistan. The two have been juxtaposed and posted below for comparison.\n\nThe gathering and celebration by IUML cadres was in response to unconfirmed reports of Rahul Gandhi contesting from Wayanad. It may be noted that the IUML is in an alliance with the UDF for the upcoming general election. This gathering was reported by News18 Kerala on March 26. In the video posted below, from 5:45 onwards, the relevant portion can be viewed, in which green-coloured IUML banners can be seen.\n\nAlt News has observed on numerous occasions how green-coloured banners at political rallies are claimed to be Pakistani flags. This misinformation is then shared widely on various platforms. Earlier in May 2018, ahead of the Karnataka assembly election, an IUML flag at a Congress rally was falsely alleged to be the Pakistani flag. The same video had resurfaced a few days back on social media, with the same claim.", "lang": "en"}
