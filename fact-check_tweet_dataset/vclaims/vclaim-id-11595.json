Her visit to the last of these countries prompted some controversy a month later when news reports claimed that her one-day visit to Cairo had cost U.S. taxpayers $95,050 in fees paid to a hotel there.\n\nThe business web site Quartz, for example, reported that Trump had spent one night in Cairo, yielding a hotel bill of \u201cover $95,000\u201d:\n\nMelania Trump\u2019s stay in Cairo during her October trip to Africa cost taxpayers $95,050, according to federal spending records. The US first lady and her entourage racked up the tab at the Semiramis Intercontinental Cairo, which offers rooms starting at $119. The hotel\u2019s presidential suite can be rented for $699, which includes $156.50 in taxes, per the property\u2019s website.\n\nQuartz later corrected their article after Melania Trump\u2019s spokesperson Stephanie Grisham clarified that the First Lady had not, in fact, stayed overnight in Cairo.\n\nFor their part, the progressive web site the Daily Kos reported that \u201cMelania Trump\u2019s $95,000 one-day hotel stay was billed to U.S, taxpayers \u2014 but she didn\u2019t stay there,\u201d and The Cut (a blog on the web site of New York magazine) wrote that \u201cThe United States Department of State paid a hotel in Cairo nearly a $100,000 for a single day of services during Melania Trump\u2019s trip to Egypt, part of her tour of the African continent, according to a government spending report.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. State Department did pay the Semiramis InterContinental Hotel $95,050 for what official spending records described as \u201c[First Lady] visit hotel rooms.\u201d However, Trump herself never stayed overnight there, and the services provided by the hotel may not have been rendered while the First Lady was actually in Cairo, contrary to the reports highlighted above.\n\nAccording to the details of the State Department \u201caward,\u201d the \u201cperiod of performance\u201d by the hotel was 30 September 2018, which was six days before Melania Trump\u2019s visit to the city of Cairo. This suggests that the accommodations or other services the hotel charged for were provided to staff engaged in planning the First Lady\u2019s visit as well as Secret Service personnel making advance security arrangements, but the precise details of the $95,050 payment remain unclear.\n\nWe asked a spokesperson for the First Lady for a breakdown of that payment, including the number of rooms, number of staff involved, and details about any other services provided by the hotel, but the spokesperson said she was not immediately in a position to provide that information and would get back to us.", "lang": "en"}
