That\u2019s contradicted by Apple\u2019s chief executive officer, who said that \u201cthere\u2019s large parts of this that we would have done in any situation.\u201d\n\nNot all of the money is exactly new spending. Apple said that a portion of its contribution would come from continuing its \u201ccurrent pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers,\u201d which is expected to be $55 billion in 2018. If it spent that amount each year for five years, it would total $275 billion.\n\nApple said another $75 billion consists of capital expenditures, new manufacturing investments and taxes paid on overseas profits transferred back to the U.S.\n\nBut the president credited the Republican tax bill he signed into law in late December for the full amount during remarks he made to members of Congress at a GOP retreat in West Virginia.\n\nApple did announce that it will be creating 20,000 jobs as part of a $350 billion contribution to the U.S. economy over the next five years. But the company did not attribute all it has planned to the new tax law.\n\nA Jan. 17 press release said: \u201cCombining new investments and Apple\u2019s current pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers \u2014 an estimated $55 billion for 2018 \u2014 Apple\u2019s direct contribution to the US economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years, not including Apple\u2019s ongoing tax payments, the tax revenues generated from employees\u2019 wages and the sale of Apple products.\u201d\n\nAs for new investments, the press release stated: \u201cPlanned capital expenditures in the US, investments in American manufacturing over five years and a record tax payment upon repatriation of overseas profits will account for approximately $75 billion of Apple\u2019s direct contribution.\u201d\n\nOf that amount, the tech giant said $38 billion would come from taxes it will pay on about $250 billion in foreign profits it plans to bring back to the U.S. That was the only explicit mention of the tax law, which lowered the tax rate from 35 percent to 15.5 percent on overseas cash that companies repatriate to the U.S.\n\nIn addition, Apple said it plans to spend $30 billion on capital expenditures, including $10 billion on investments in data centers across the country. The company also plans to increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund by $4 billion \u201cto support innovation among American manufacturers and help others establish a presence in the US.\u201d\n\nAnd though Trump said that \u201cthey\u2019re going to build a lot of plants\u201d with the $350 billion, Apple\u2019s release only mentioned the construction of one new corporate campus in an unspecified location, \u201cwhich will initially house technical support for customers.\u201d\n\nWe asked Apple representatives how much of the $350 billion contribution was directly related to the tax law, but didn\u2019t get a response.\n\nThat said, Apple CEO Tim Cook previously indicated that not all of it is. He told ABC News reporter Rebecca Jarvis in an interview in January that \u201cthere are large parts of this that are the result of tax reform, and there\u2019s large parts of this that we would have done in any situation.\u201d\n\nCook said he \u201chasn\u2019t spent a lot of time categorizing the two,\u201d but his statement means that Trump can\u2019t attribute everything that Apple has planned to the Republican tax legislation that he signed into law.", "lang": "en"}
