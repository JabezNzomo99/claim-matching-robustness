The claims are false; the images have no connection to the Sahiwal raid, and the police officer has not been killed.\n\nThe Facebook posts, for example this one which has been viewed 13,000 times since it was posted January 25, 2018, combine a video of a policeman speaking about alleged corruption in Sahiwal with a video of a dead body, and claim the policeman has been killed.\n\nThe unidentified policeman in the video is saying in Punjabi: \u201cMr Chief Minister, Inspector General Punjab and all law enforcement agencies. My life is in danger because of evidence I have against DPO (District Police Officer) Sahiwal.\u201d\n\nThe second video then shows a dead body lying in a pool of blood.\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s caption says: \u201cShocking!! This is the Justice system in Pakistan. A policeman, who had publically claimed to have evidence against the officials & was fearful about his life, is brutally murdred. Hope New CJP take notice #JusticeAsifSaeedKhosa.\u201d\n\nThe video was also shared on Twitter here where it has been viewed 42,000 times since it was posted January 25, 2019.\n\nHere is another similar post, which contains still images taken from the same two videos, and has been shared 322 times since it was posted January 25, 2019.\n\nThe post's caption says: \"The policeman who witnessed the Sahiwal tragedy is also murdered.\"\n\nThe post is referring to a January 19, 2019, incident in which four people were killed by counter terrorism police in Sahiwal.\n\nHere is a report by Pakistani state media on the raid, which the country\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan also tweeted about here.\n\nThe policeman speaking in the video and seen in the photograph in the misleading Facebook posts is Naveed Alam, an-ex constable from Sahiwal.\n\nThe footage of him speaking about corruption was originally shared here on the Facebook page of Shakarghar24 -- a local news website -- on 20 February, 2018, where it has been viewed more than three million times.\n\nAlam also shared the footage on his Facebook page on February 25, 2018.\n\nAfter the misleading posts linking Alam's anti-corruption video to the Sahiwal incident began circulating on social media, for example on YouTube here and here on January 21, and on Facebook on January 22 here, Alam posted a statement on his Facebook page.\n\n\u201cI am Naveed Alam constable speaking from Sahiwal. I had raised my voice against the corrupt clerk mafia of DPO Sahiwal office and uploaded videos about their corruption,\u201d he says in the January 24, 2019 post.\n\n\u201cI request those people who are linking my videos and photos... with the Sahiwal incident that they should refrain from it otherwise I will proceed against them under cyber crime (law). Please do not misuse my videos.\u201d\n\nSahiwal police tweeted on January 22, 2019 that the footage of Alam was not linked to the January 19 raid.\n\n\"This video is about one year old. Constable Naveed Alam was dismissed from police. He runs a fruit stall at Mission Chowk Sahiwal. It is highly regrettable to deliberately link the old news with current DPO Sahiwal Captain (retired) Mohammad Ali Zia.\u201d\n\nAccording to a reverse image search, the second video used in the misleading Facebook posts, which shows a dead body in a pool of blood, actually is of another January 21, 2019 incident in the nearby town of Pakpattan.\n\nThe exact same footage can be seen in this YouTube video posted January 21 with a headline saying: \"Pakpattan kachari incident .Abrahim Malkana and Ifraheem Malkana Murder today\".\n\nBelow is a Punjab police statement about the Pakpattan incident:\n\nThe police report says that two men and their lawyer's assistant were killed at a court in Pakpattan district, some 49 kilometers southeast of Sahiwal, on January 21, 2019.\n\n\"Both accused were present in the chamber of their lawyer when ten to twelve persons laced with weapons came and opened fire on them. Resultantly, both accused Ibraheem and Ifraheem along with Munshi (clerk or assistant) of the lawyer Yusuf died on the spot,\" the report said giving only first names.\n\nHere is a report on the incident in the English-language daily newspaper Dawn.\n\nIn this report by AbbTakk television on the Pakpattan incident, which was posted on their official YouTube channel January 20, 2019, the dead body featured in the footage in the misleading Facebook posts can be seen from a different angle.\n\nThe spokesman for Punjab\u2019s Chief Minister Shahbaz Gill said on Twitter that policeman Naveed Alam was alive.\n\n\u201cMasha Allah (what Allah wishes) constable Naveed is alive and healthy. News of his murder are baseless.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
