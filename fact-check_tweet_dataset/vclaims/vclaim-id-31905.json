It has been shared over 500 times.\n\nThe photos are in fact of Peruvian police. Both images seem to be from a Peruvian Independence Day parade in 2007.\n\nPESCO stands for \u201cPermanent Structured Cooperation\u201d, which is an EU strategy for closer cooperation on security and defence among members.\n\nThere is an initial list of 17 projects that will take place as part of PESCO, and 17 more were added last year. None of these include plans for an EU police force.\n\nRegardless, the UK is not signed up to PESCO, and can opt-out of EU policies relating to freedom, security and justice.", "lang": "en"}
