A screenshot of the present policy can be seen below.\n\nTo compare the changes that have been made, Alt News accessed the cached version of the privacy policy as it appeared on PM Modi\u2019s website on March 23rd, a day before the expos\u00e9. A backup of the cached version can be accessed here and here.\n\nTill a day before the expos\u00e9, the privacy policy on the website read as, \u201cYour personal information and contact details shall remain confidential and shall not be used for any purpose other than our communication with you. The information shall not be provided to third parties in any manner whatsoever without your consent.\u201d\n\nA screenshot of the same can be seen below.\n\nThe changes to the privacy policy have been made surreptitiously since neither the verified Twitter account of the Prime Minister nor the verified account narendramodi_in which claims to be the \u201cTwitter account of http://www.narendramodi.in \u2013 Shri Narendra Modi\u2019s personal website & the Narendra Modi Mobile App.\u201d acknowledged the issue. The NaMo APP also hasn\u2019t followed the standard practice to inform the users when changes to the privacy policy are made, a practice that most major apps and websites follow.\n\nWhile the PM\u2019s website claimed that personal information would not be provided to third parties in any manner whatsoever without the consent of the user, it was doing exactly the opposite. These hurried changes to the privacy policy further go onto prove that there was a clear privacy breach by PM Narendra Modi\u2019s mobile app.", "lang": "en"}
