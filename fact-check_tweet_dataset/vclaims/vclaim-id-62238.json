Ron Johnson.\n\nIn a July 1, 2020, interview with Axios, the Wisconsin Republican discussed his proposed changes to the PPP, which was part of an effort to protect the economy from the effects of coronavirus. But he also added a statement that may have had listeners seeing dollar signs:\n\n\"PPP on average probably provided a grant of around $11,000 per employee,\" he said.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at that figure.\n\nThe PPP is a $650 billion program intended to keep small businesses afloat during the coronavirus pandemic by providing them money \u2014 primarily used to pay workers.\n\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration distributed more than $521 billion through the program as of June 30, 2020, according to a report released July 6, 2020. Roughly $131 billion set aside for the program remains undistributed.\n\nThe PPP money is distributed as loans that can be fully forgiven if the money is used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The loans are subject to various requirements, such as that businesses use at least 60% for payroll. That number was reduced from the previous requirement of 75%.\n\nBusinesses originally had just eight weeks to spend the loans, but that period was increased to 24 weeks in early June.\n\nThe loans are intended for small businesses, which are generally defined as those with fewer than 500 employees.\n\nThe $521 billion in loans supported 51 million jobs as of the end of June, according to the July SBA report. That translates to about $10,200 per employee \u2014 but that assumes 100% of the money went directly to employee payroll, which is not the case.\n\nFor instance, if every company put just 60% of its loan toward payroll \u2014 the minimum required for the loan to be forgiven \u2014 that would average out to just over $6,000 per employee.\n\nWhen asked to back the claim of $11,000 per employee, Johnson spokesperson Aaren Johnson used a different method.\n\nAaren Johnson used the private-sector employer\u2019s average cost for employee compensation from December 2019 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, calculated that for a full work week and put that number in the context of an eight-week period, the original period of time the loans were meant to cover.\n\nUsing these metrics, the average loan per employee was around $11,110.\n\nAaren Johnson emphasized the senator\u2019s comment was made in the context of his proposal for a PPP replacement program, which included a federal grant of $10,000 per employee to businesses.\n\nHe added the senator \"was talking about the payroll-covering part of the PPP forgivable loan\" when he made his statement.\n\nKevin Mumford, a professor of economics at Purdue University, said Johnson\u2019s method of calculation is \"reasonable as a rough approximation\" of the average loan per employee.\n\nMumford noted the average amount of money per employee would vary by business depending on the percentage of the loan businesses put toward payroll and benefits.\n\nJohn Witte, professor emeritus of public affairs and political science at the University of Wisconsin, also said Johnson\u2019s method was accurate without immediate access to detailed tax data from the businesses.\n\nWitte added it was \"correct\" to use the average employer cost for employee compensation from December 2019, because that was before the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the U.S. economy, altering those payment figures.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics report for March 2020 showed a slightly higher average cost of employee compensation than the December 2019 figure. Had Sen. Johnson used that figure, his average loan per employee would have been around $12,000.\n\nSen. Johnson said the \"PPP on average probably provided a grant of around $11,000 per employee.\"\n\nAlthough the methodology used to calculate this figure is an approximation due to lack of access to detailed tax information, it largely aligns with the $10,200 average the PPP data shows. But both figures assume businesses are applying 100% of the loans toward payroll, which is not always the case.\n\nOur definition of Mostly True is \"the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\"", "lang": "en"}
