Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed,\" Lady Gaga tweeted.\n\nAccording to the fake account, just hours after the offending tweet, Gaga and Melania Trump met face-to-face, with Gaga hurling insults while the future first lady ignored the enraged pop star. That\u2019s when Gaga threw something at Trump, according to fake witnesses, forcing the Secret Service to intervene.\n\n\"The New York Post tried to reach out to the NYPD after it was reported that GooGoo was taken away in a black Yukon in handcuffs, but as of yet there\u2019s no record of an arrest,\" the item read. \"You can rest assured if this incident isn\u2019t prosecuted by the corrupt liberals in the city government that the less-than-lady will be staring down the barrel of a multi-million dollar lawsuit.\"\n\nThe item surfaced Sep. 3 on American Flavor, which we\u2019ve previously labeled a fake news site.

But as one eagle-eyed writer at Snopes points out, it\u2019s actually a screengrab of actress Amanda Bynes being escorted into a courthouse in 2013.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
