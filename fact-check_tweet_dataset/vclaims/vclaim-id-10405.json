Khuzami, the deputy U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, an \u201cObama holdover\u201d?\n\n\n\nA: No. Khuzami served under Democratic and Republican administrations, but he left government in 2013. He returned to public service this year when he was hired by the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nRobert S. Khuzami \u2014 the man leading the investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Michael Cohen \u2014 has received considerable media attention this month.\n\nBut contrary to reports circulating on Facebook, Khuzami, the deputy U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, is not an \u201cObama holdover\u201d \u2014 a term used to describe an administration official who remains on staff even after a new president takes office.\n\nKhuzami did serve as the director of enforcement at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during the Obama administration. But he left government in 2013 and did not return to public service until earlier this year, when Geoffrey S. Berman, the interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, tapped Khuzami to become his deputy. Berman himself was appointed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a member of Trump\u2019s cabinet.\n\nSo Facebook users were right to flag as false an April 14 story on gellerreport.com that carried the headline \u201cObama Holdover Accused of Corruption Approved Trump Lawyer Raid.\u201d That story originated on frontpagemag.com, a website operated by the conservative center of controversial author and political activist David Horowitz. Thousands of people have shared the links to the posts, and commenters on social media expressed dismay and outrage over Khuzami, who one man called a \u201cswamp dweller.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Khuzami cemented a career in public service long before Obama\u2019s presidency: From 1990 to 2002, during Republican and Democratic administrations, he worked as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he took on cases involving financial crimes and terrorism targeting landmarks in New York City. After that, Khuzami was Deutsche Bank\u2019s general counsel for the Americas before he was named to his position at the SEC in 2009.\n\nNow, as the second-highest prosecutor in the Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office, Khuzami is leading the investigation into Cohen\u2019s activities. (It\u2019s widely reported that Berman recused himself, but the precise reason for that isn\u2019t clear.)\n\nA recent federal court filing by Khuzami described the case as a grand jury investigation being handled by his office and the FBI into \u201ccriminal conduct that largely centers on (Cohen\u2019s) personal business dealings.\u201d\n\nThe Cohen investigation burst into public view on April 9, when FBI agents raided Cohen\u2019s office in Manhattan. News reports indicate that among the documents sought were those related to nondisclosure agreements made with women who have publicly alleged affairs with Trump.\n\nMultiple media reports say that U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein signed off on the raid, and Khuzami\u2019s filing makes clear that the searches also were authorized by a federal magistrate judge who determined that investigators had probable cause.\n\nKhuzami\u2019s filing also confirms that the case was referred to his office by the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials who sought to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe story calling Khuzami an \u201cObama holdover\u201d does correctly note that Khuzami spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2004, where he praised the Patriot Act, and that he donated to Republican Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nBut, the author opines, the \u201cmuch more significant factor is his SEC gig.\u201d The story then cherry-picks information to allege that Khuzami has a history of corruption.\n\nFor example, it cites a story about an SEC inspector general\u2019s report that dealt with a complaint that Khuzami had \u201cforced\u201d his staff to drop fraud charges against Citigroup officials. The Citigroup case centered on allegations that the bank misled investors about its exposure to subprime securities.\n\nBut the story cited omits the inspector general\u2019s conclusion: The investigation \u201cdid not find evidence substantiating the claims in the January 3, 2011 anonymous complaint, alleging \u2018serious problems with special access and preferential treatment\u2019 at the SEC.\u201d\n\nThe report said that settlements paid by Citigroup officials \u201cwere part of a negotiation process that involved several members of the Enforcement staff working collectively on the Citigroup investigation.\u201d\n\nAnother part of the story about Khuzami resurrects a controversy surrounding the destruction of certain SEC files, in particular those related to \u201cmatters under inquiry\u201d \u2014 initial reviews that could potentially become investigations \u2014 that never evolved into full investigations.\n\nAfter an SEC whistleblower contacted the National Archives and Records Administration in 2010 about the agency destroying such files, the SEC stopped the practice and worked with NARA to develop new policies for records retention.\n\nAlthough that issue raised questions about the SEC\u2019s policing of Wall Street, it began well before Khuzami\u2019s time there: In a September 2011 letter to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, Khuzami noted that the discarding of those files dated back to at least 1998. He also said that certain information about those matters under inquiry \u2014 even those that did not grow into full probes \u2014 had been kept electronically, dating back about 20 years.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cAttorney General Jeff Sessions Appoints Geoffrey S.
