Even Andrew Leigh is up for death taxes, let alone the union movement.\"\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison stands accused of spreading \"fake news\" by claiming Labor, the Greens and the union movement all support the reintroduction of a \"death tax\". [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Morrison\u2019s claims that the Greens, shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh and \u201cthe union movement\u201d are all \u201cup for\u201d death taxes.\n\nAAP FactCheck found the PM\u2019s claim to be somewhat false.\n\nDeath taxes, otherwise known as inheritance taxes, are a one-off levy paid on money or property exceeding a certain threshold when the original owner dies.\n\nThey serve as another form of revenue for government and are considered to stimulate philanthropy by encouraging donations to charities. [2]\n\nDeath taxes were introduced in Australia\u2019s colonies in the early 19th century. By federation in 1901, they had been adopted by all states. The federal government introduced additional death taxes in 1914, but by 1984 all death taxes levied at state and federal level were abolished. [3]\n\nDuring the second week of the 2019 federal election campaign Labor accused the Liberals of running a \u201cscare campaign\u201d by peddling \u201cfake news\u201d on social media that Labor plans to introduce a death tax. [4]\n\nLabor complained to Facebook, demanding the social media platform take down posts containing these false claims. [5]\n\nAustralian Council of Trade Union\u2019s boss Sally McManus was dragged into the debate when a fake tweet, photo-shopped to imply it came from her account, was shared by conservatives including a former Howard-government minister Gary Hardgrave who later apologised for being duped.\n\nThe fake tweet read, \u201cAt the Labor National Conference the imposition of an Inheritance Tax was passed by a majority of candidates as being an objective within the term of the next Parliament, the ACTU proudly supports this initiative.\u201d [6]\n\nGreens leader Richard Di Natale told AAP FactCheck the prime minister was \u201cdesperate\u201d and \u201clying\u201d by claiming the Greens were pro death taxes. \u201cAn inheritance tax is not part of our fully-costed election platform in 2019,\u201d the senator told AAP FactCheck.\n\nLast month however Greens Queensland Senator Larissa Waters told ABC Radio\u2019s RN Drive that death taxes were in the party\u2019s \u201cpolicy platform\u201d, but it was not a policy they were taking to the election.\n\n\u201cWe have reams and reams of fantastic policy that our members write, and it\u2019s up there for all to see. We then craft from that an election policy platform that we cost,\u201d Senator Waters said. \u201cBut we\u2019re open to the conversation.\u201d [7]\n\nA spokesperson for Senator Di Natale told AAP FactCheck the party did not object to the concept of death taxes in principle, but it was not policy they\u2019ve adopted.\n\nRegarding shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh, he worked as an Australian National University economics professor, with a PhD in Public Policy from Harvard, before entering politics in 2010. [8]\n\nIn 2006, he wrote an article for The New Matilda, an independent news website, advocating for the return of the \u201cinheritance tax\u201d. \u201cWe believe that reinstating an inheritance tax on the super-rich would be consistent with the Australian values of egalitarianism and the fair go,\u201d he said. [9]\n\nMr Leigh has since repeatedly said, most recently on radio 2GB on April 22, 2019, he no longer holds that view. Speaking on Money News Mr Leigh said: \u201cInheritance taxes died at the federal level 40 years ago in 1979. Labor has no plans to bring them back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirteen years ago I was an academic floating ideas. Now, as a policymaker, I've been asked repeatedly my views on inheritance taxes, death taxes over the years. I've always said I don't support them. Let\u2019s call it for what it is: it's a lie. It's a lie, pure and simple.\u201d [10] [11]\n\nBack in 2016 Mr Leigh also rejected claims he supported death taxes in an interview with Peter van Onselen on Sky News TV.\n\n\u201cPeter, you're like a dog with an old manky bone that has been dug up deep in the backyard. I think this is like the sixth time you've raised this issue with me\u2026 Inheritance taxes are dead Peter, get over it,\u201d he told Sky News. [12]\n\nRegarding the position of the ACTU, the current tax policy linked on the union\u2019s website includes a section stating, \u201cCongress believes that consideration should be given to taxing inheritances in the hands of the beneficiary. A lifetime threshold could be made available to the taxpayer with tax payable once cumulative inheritances exceeded the threshold.\u201d\n\nHowever, the ACTU does not prosecute a case for death taxes, as it does with other categories in its tax policy. [13]\n\nA spokesperson for the ACTU told AAP FactCheck, \u201cThe ACTU supports the tax policies of the ALP. These do not include a death tax.\u201d\n\nBased on the ACTU\u2019s statements, AAP FactCheck finds the PM\u2019s claim about the union to be mostly false.\n\nBased on Mr Leigh's strong and constant rejection of death taxes as a politician, AAP FactCheck finds the PM\u2019s claim is false.\n\nBased on the statements from the Greens, AAP FactCheck finds the PM\u2019s claim is mostly true, as while a death tax is not a 2019 Green\u2019s election policy, it is part of their suite of policy platforms.", "lang": "en"}
