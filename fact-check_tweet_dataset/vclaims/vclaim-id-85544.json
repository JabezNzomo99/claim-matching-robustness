This takes into account all the benefits that can be shared with members of a household, even if not everyone in the household qualifies for it or receives it.\n\nSome public assistance programs, such as Social Security and Medicaid, are based on individual eligibility. But others, such as SNAP or TANF, provide household-level benefits. For example, if you have a household with two ineligible legal permanent resident parents but two U.S.-born children who can receive SNAP, your household would share the benefit.\n\nA White House spokesman explained: \u201cUnder the current system, you get welfare through your household. The new legislation will expand the five-year welfare prohibition to the households of all immigrants coming in on the points system, and not just to the immigrant themselves (as is current law). That keeps them from immediately going on welfare.\u201d\n\nIn a 2016 report, Alex Nowrasteh, of the Libertarian think tank Cato Institute, warned against measuring welfare use by households, because it \u201cdoes not reveal who receives the benefits, leaving the impression that the immigrants are the intended legal beneficiaries when they are often legally excluded from these programs.\u201d\n\nEven when looking at households, the definition of \u201cwelfare\u201d makes a difference. This graph below shows the breakdown of public assistance programs by households, using data from a September 2016 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine on the economic impacts of the U.S. immigration system.\n\nThe legislation specifies that for immigrants who receive visas through the points system, \u201cevery member of the household of such alien, shall not be eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit\u201d for five years. But the points system applies to about 140,000 skills-based immigrants, which is 14 percent of the roughly 1 million legal immigrants accepted per year. The skills-based immigrants tend to be more educated, and less likely to access public benefits, experts say. This requirement would not affect the vast majority of legal immigrants, including refugees, who are exempted under current law.\n\n\u201cIt would be a departure to deny household members. I don\u2019t believe it would stand a legal challenge, that a U.S. citizen child with a parent who is a recent legal immigrant gets treated differently under the law than a child with a U.S.-born parent,\u201d said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the nonpartisan think tank Migration Policy Institute. \u201cThat would violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed the Senate bill would prevent new immigrants from immediately collecting welfare. But that is misleading. In general, legal permanent residents are not eligible for the major federal public assistance programs during their first five years of residency. There are some exceptions, such as refugees and asylees, or people with military connections.\n\nWhat Trump is talking about is extending the five-year ban so that new immigrants would not be able to benefit from public assistance that their family members may qualify for, because they are legal permanent residents who lived in the United States for more than five years, or were born in the United States. This is a very specific way to look at use of \u201cwelfare\u201d by immigrants, which is not clear to the average voter without lots of context.", "lang": "en"}
