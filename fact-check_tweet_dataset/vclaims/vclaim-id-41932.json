Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) firing in protest against Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB). Fact: The video in the post is an old video. The same video is being shared for the last one year with different claims. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, many similar videos were found in the search results. The same video is being shared from the last year with different claims. While some claimed it to be related to Mexico, the others have posted that the video is related to Nagaland. Some claimed the video is related to a celebratory firing on the eve of New Year. The context of the video cannot be ascertained with the available information, but it can be concluded that it not a recent video. The same video can be found to be uploaded in January-2019 on YouTube. So, it is not related to any recent protests in Assam against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, an old video is being falsely shared as \u2018ULFA fire in protest against CAB\u2019.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
