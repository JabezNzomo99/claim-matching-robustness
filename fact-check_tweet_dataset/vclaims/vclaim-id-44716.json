The design of the Philippine Flag may only be changed by amending the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 8491), which needs to undergo a plebiscite or referendum to be ratified.\u201d\n\nThe untrue post featured an illustration of the supposed new design, changing the present two horizontal bands of blue and red, to three horizontal bands in a blue-red-blue scheme. The first version of the post, which has since been taken down, was published by an impostor page pretending to be the NHCP.\n\nThe circulating versions of the false post grabbed the fake flag uploaded by the fraudulent NHCP page and added this phrase to the new infographic: \u201cStart June 12 2020 Well Change of New Flag.\u201d\n\nIn a June 1 advisory, NHCP Executive Director Restituto Aguilar said the institution did not make the fake FB page, or advocate or support a new design for the national flag.\n\n\u201cThe NHCP has neither the mandate nor the intent to change the current specifications of our National Flag,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fallacious \u201cchange of new flag\u201d infographic was published after the NHCP released on its FB page educational posters in celebration of National Flag Days, being observed from May 28 to June 12. The deceptive posts dubiously copied the layout of the May 28 and May 29 posts of NHCP.\n\nThe versions of the false post published by two netizens flagged by VERA Files have collectively been shared almost 200 times. The now-deleted post by the fake NHCP page, which received backlash from netizens who pointed out that it was a fraud, was shared over 900 times.", "lang": "en"}
