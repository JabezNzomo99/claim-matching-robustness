The figure is 60% for people sentenced to less than a year. These figures are for people released between April 2013 and March 2014.\n\nThe overall rate of proven re-offending has remained stable for the past decade.\n\nRe-offences don\u2019t have to be as serious as the original offence. Receiving a caution in the year after release from prison counts as a proven re-offence in these figures.\n\nWhile re-offending is highest for short-sentenced prisoners, this doesn\u2019t mean short sentences are less effective on their own. The Ministry of Justice warns that figures for different sentence types \u201cshould not be compared to assess the effectiveness of sentences\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s because people who are sentenced to under a year don\u2019t necessarily share the same characteristics as people who get cautions or who are sentenced to longer periods, so it\u2019s not possible to tell whether the sentences themselves have any effect on re-offending.", "lang": "en"}
