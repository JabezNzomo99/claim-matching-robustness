Trump 2020.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because the photo doesn\u2019t show the whistleblower. The man in the photos is Alexander Soros, the son of Democratic fundraiser George Soros and deputy chairman of the Open Society Foundations.\n\nHe posted the photo with Pelosi on Instagram on Sept. 2.\n\n\"Inspiring meeting with speaker @nancypelosi,\" he wrote. As she says: our #diversity is our strength, our #unity is our power! #bluewave2020\"\n\nHe posted the photo with Clinton back in July 2016.\n\n\"There can only be one #womancrushwednesday today and that is of course @hillaryclinton, not just for being the first woman to run for president from this nation\u2019s two largest political parties, but I believe the best presidential candidate this nation could have today!,\" he wrote.\n\nThe whistleblower who alleged Trump is soliciting foreign interference from Ukraine in the 2020 election has legal protection from retaliation. U.S. officials have kept that person\u2019s name confidential and most news organizations have also withheld the name.\n\nThis photo\u2019s claim is wrong, and even commenters on this Facebook post have offered corrections.", "lang": "en"}
