Jones, the court ruled that the sitting president could not postpone a civil lawsuit until he left office. That lawsuit pertained to President Bill Clinton\u2019s conduct before taking office.\n\nWhy did Mueller slog through this obstruction probe if he could never bring charges? The report says: \u201cWhile the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be prosecuted, it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President\u2019s term is permissible. The OLC opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves office. And if individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at this time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
