This is not true.\n\nThe photo appears in one post (here) with overlaid text that reads: \u201cThe moment you realize it\u2019s not about Black Lives anymore, it\u2019s only about vandalism\u201d. Another version of the photo with thousands of shares (here) carries the caption: \u201cALL STATUE LIVES MATTER\u201d, implying a link with recent protests.\n\nThe Jim Hendrix statue is located in Seattle (here!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sK1B1Lfo-84oTybcuIjl1xQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192), his place of birth.\n\nAccording to a news report from the Seattle Times, the photo was taken in September, 2013, after two men were arrested for spraying blue paint at a number of locations, including the statue, while intoxicated (here).\n\nSome confusion about the source of the graffiti may stem from a Facebook post by a niece of Jimi Hendrix on June 24 (here). In the post Tina Hendrix shares the same photo and writes: \u201cEach time Jimi\u2019s statue is defaced our family feels very hurt. It seems to happen on a regular basis. I\u2019ve been working to get the statue moved to Jimi\u2019s old neighborhood where it belongs. Thanks for your support\u201d. She did not note the date the photo was taken.\n\nFalse. The photo showing blue paint on the statue of Jimi Hendrix was taken in 2013 and is not connected to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
