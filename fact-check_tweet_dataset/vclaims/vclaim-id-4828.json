No, that's not true: the story was made up by a known fauxtire site that makes up tales about weird crimes, sex acts and incidents of racism for entertainment and satire purposes. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on July 10, 2018 titled \"McDonald's Manager Shoots Man For Putting Soda In His Free Water Cup\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nATLANTA - It is being reported that An Atlanta man was shot inside a local McDonalds for apparently putting soda in his water cup. According to authorities, he was shot by the McDonalds restaurant manager. Kyle Davis, 25, was shot multiple times by McDonald's store manager Jerry Goldberg, 53, for asking for a water cup and instead putting soda in it. Kyle was shot 3 times and was taken to the nearest hospital. Medical staff say Kyle is expected to live. Jerry told authorities he was tired of people asking for free water cups and getting soda instead, and couldn't take it anymore. \"These N*ggas walk in here asking for a water cup and get sprite and sh*t, i said hell nah not this time\", said Jerry.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and might have thought it was a real news story:\n\nBut the man pictured in the graphic illustrating the story is definitely not a McDonalds manager. He is actually Stephen Brown, a pedophile who was arrested in 2015:\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: White Woman Did NOT Call Cops On Innocent Man Selling Crack Cocaine Outside Her Apartment\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Alabama Man In Custody After Promising Kids V-Bucks, Did NOT Sexually Abuse Them\n\u2022 Fake News: Germany NOT Discussing Nuking South Korea After Being Eliminated From FIFA World Cup\n\u2022 NOT Fake News: Shooting Suspect Actualy Arrested In Death Of XXXTentacion\n\u2022 Fake News: Jr Smith Did NOT Admit He Drank Hennessy During Halftime Of Game 1 Of The NBA Finals", "lang": "en"}
