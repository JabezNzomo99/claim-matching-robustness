Jhantu is a derogatory term for someone stupid. The tweet got over 3600 retweets and nearly 10,000 likes at the time of writing this story.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that jhadu (broom) is the party symbol of AAP, and both the terms are phonetically similar.\n\nThe archived version of the tweet can be accessed here.\n\nThe same post is also viral on several Facebook pages.\n\nThe image of Kejriwal tweeted by Gupta is nothing but a bad photoshop. Several comments on Gupta's tweet itself takes a jibe at the MLA for the bad photoshop attempt.\n\nA closer look at the poster clearly shows the bad attempt at photoshop. The original poster released by the AAP for campaigning can be seen below.\n\nWhen we compare the two posters, it becomes clear that an alphabet in jhadu has been replaced, thus changing the entire meaning of the word.", "lang": "en"}
