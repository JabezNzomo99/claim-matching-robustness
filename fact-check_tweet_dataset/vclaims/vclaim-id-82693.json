(Read about it here, here and here)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pages, who were vociferous in their opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP, have deleted nearly all posts from 2019 barring their profile photo and cover picture. Archived versions of these pages can be viewed here, here and here.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the last post seen on the page was on May 5, 2019, in the form of a profile picture update.\n\nAll other posts, except for a video, have been purged. The video clip that still remains on the page is that from BJP President Amit Shah's press conference including PM Modi on May 17, 2019. The prime minister who has faced long standing critique for not holding press conferences during his first term did not answer any questions at the event.\n\n\n\nThe caption with the video says, \"BJP did not want this to reach the public,\" in Viral In India's typically cheeky style.\n\nThe brain behind Viral In India.\n\nBOOM had earlier documented the rise and fall of Viral In India a serial purveyor of misinformation run by Abhishek Mishra. \n\n\n\nMishra told BOOM that he was disheartened with the election results and so his page has gone silent for now.\n\n\"What else can we do after such a result. We had invested our time on social media creating an awareness but what will we do with a million followers if they don't go out and vote. We have decided to go silent for now and temporarily suspend any work on the page. If at all things change in the future, we will see,\" - Abhishek Mishra, founder of Viral In India\n\nA dejected Mishra added that they have no plans to hand over the page to any other party.\n\nIn January this year, BOOM through several telephonic interactions with Mishra, tried to find out what fueled Mishra's anti-BJP propaganda.\n\nWhile he claimed that the team of Viral In India was politically neutral, the content on Mishra's timeline as well as Viral In India's Facebook page showed otherwise.\n\nDays before the interview was published, Mishra was arrested by the crime branch unit of Delhi police on January 22, 2019.\n\nMishra was arrested for allegedly hurting religious sentiments by sharing posts from his Facebook account and the website. He was later out on bail and while the website was immediately taken down, and continues to be dysfunctional, Viral In India's Facebook page soon resurfaced.\n\nAl Jazeera had also interviewed with Mishra as part of its investigative piece 'India: Fake News and Agitprop.'\n\nA three-month old archived version of Viral In India's page shows that it was prolific in spreading misinformation until a couple of months ago.\n\nBOOM also checked the page's Twitter handle and found that all the old tweets have been deleted. The handle now has only five tweets.\n\nAll videos from Abhishek Mishra's YouTube channel have also disappeared. The channel, which has 134,499 subscribers, does not have any videos to display anymore.\n\nTwo other pages that have launched a clean-up drive after election results were announced are - I Support Ravish Kumar and Prasoon Vajpaaye Fans. \n\n\n\nMishra had categorically denied having any connection to the two pages.\n\nWhile over 1 million people follow the Prasoon Vajpaaye Fans page, I Support Ravish Kumar has 1.8 million followers.\n\nThe last post on I Support Ravish Kumar - an updated profile picture - was on May 11, 2019. Everything else has been deleted. The page earlier shared all posts created by the Viral In India Facebook page.\n\nThe page Prasoon Vajpaaye Fans posted a pro Kamal Nath post on May 31, 2019.\n\nOther posts that are still visible in a Google search have been deleted. A video with a caption that compared Narendra Modi to Adolf Hitler has also been deleted.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, on September 29, 2018, both I Support... and Prasoon Vajpaaye... had updated their cover photos.\n\nIt is not clear whether these pages with a staggering follower base will be sold or whether they will change their content going forward.\n\nBOOM reached out to the admins of both the pages but did not receive any response till the time of publishing.", "lang": "en"}
