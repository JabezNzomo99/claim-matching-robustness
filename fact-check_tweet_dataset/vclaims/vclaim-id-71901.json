We decided to take a look at the polling data.\n\nAt Obama\u2019s direction, the military began a targeted airstrike campaign in Iraq earlier this month against the Islamic State, a terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria that is also called ISIS or ISIL.\n\nWe found a number of recent surveys that asked respondents how they felt about this decision.\n\nAccording to a CNN poll published Sept. 8, 76 percent of Americans backed additional airstrikes against the Islamic State. Just 23 percent opposed.\n\nThe results were consistent with several other recent polls.\n\nVanden Heuvel also said that the Islamic State\u2019s beheading of two American journalists was the tipping point for public support of airstrikes. The videos contained a \"barbarism and a gruesomeness\" that \"moved\" Americans to back Obama on this, she said.\n\nHowever, polls don\u2019t exactly bear that out.\n\nA Washington Post/ABC poll from Aug. 13-17, found majority support, 54 percent, for airstrikes against the Islamic State. That poll was conducted before Aug. 19, when the Islamic State released footage of a Sunni insurgent beheading journalist James Foley.\n\nA Pew Research Center/USA Today poll released Aug. 18 -- also before the videos were released -- showed 54 percent of Americans supported airstrikes while just 34 percent opposed.\n\nEven earlier in the summer, the country was split on whether to launch airstrikes. A Washington Post/ABC poll from June 22 found 45 percent of respondents backed airstrikes and 46 percent opposed them. So it\u2019s not as though the pro-airstrike crowd was weak months before the beheadings, either.\n\nWhile support for airstrikes jumped in the aftermath of the gruesome videos, it was already building and above 50 percent before news outlets learned two journalists were beheaded.\n\nObama has vowed not to get American troops directly involved in combat in Iraq and Syria.\n\nPolls are mixed, but it does not seem that there\u2019s a great appetite for \"boots on the ground,\" as some may say.\n\nThe September Reuters poll allowed respondents to select multiple actions they deemed appropriate for America to take to fight the Islamic State. Choices ranged from humanitarian aid to no intervention at all. Just 9 percent of respondents favored sending troops, easily the least-chosen option.\n\nSimilarly, CNN found two-thirds of Americans opposed ground troops while about one-third supported it.\n\nThe Huffington Post/YouGov poll (the most-recent poll we found) had a far less definitive result. Asked if they would support or oppose ground troops in Iraq and Syria to fight the Islamic State, 38 percent expressed some support while 44 percent were against it. So a plurality opposed the move, but it was much closer than other surveys.\n\nOn This Week, vanden Heuvel embellished a bit when she said support for ground troops to fight the Islamic State was \"not there\" and \"very thin,\" but her general point is on target. Polls found at least a plurality opposed sending combat troops to fight the Islamic State.\n\nVanden Heuvel said Americans now \"support strikes (to fight the Islamic State) but the support for ground troops is not there. The support is very thin.\"\n\nIn general, vanden Heuvel captures the sentiment of the American people. But she over-exaggerates the influence of videos showing beheadings of journalists on Americans' attitudes about airstrikes. There was already majority support for airstrikes before the killing of the first journalist, James Foley.\n\nIt is also a stretch to say support for ground troops is \"not there\" or \"very thin.\" It is a minority opinion, but at least two polls show one-third of Americans support the idea.\n\nOn balance, we rate her claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
