The congressman is currently running for Minnesota attorney general and has denied the allegations.\n\nBut the focus here is the claim that Phillps is \"charged with ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination at his companies,\" as the ad\u2019s narrator goes on to say.\n\n\"Sleazy Keith Ellison and Shady Dean Phillips, both caught up in another sexual harassment scandal. Ellison accused of physical abuse. Phillips charged with ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination at his companies. Sued over and over again. A whistleblower says he told Phillips' board of the abuse, warning the harassment was a serious problem that was being covered up. Keith Ellison. Dean Phillips. They are the problem. Dean Phillips, your time is up.\"\n\nWe wanted to sort out the facts. We found that Phillips is not connected to Ellison\u2019s case, and the allegation against him is based on a decades-old lawsuit filed against an organization where he was once a board member.\n\nThe ad makes the suggestion that Phillips has been \"sued over and over\" and was \"charged\" with ignoring sexual harassment at his companies. We found no evidence that supports either claim.\n\nTo be clear: Phillips is not involved in the domestic abuse allegations levied against Ellison by a former girlfriend, nor is Phillips involved in any sexual harassment case.\n\nThe Paulsen campaign points to a February 2007 Star Tribune article that discusses a lawsuit brought against Allina Health by seven nurses who said they were sexually harassed by a doctor at one of the health group\u2019s clinics. The case was settled out of court.\n\nThe news account quotes a letter that was sent by another doctor to an Allina board member.\n\nThe doctor vouched for the lawsuit, saying the harassment was a serious problem at the clinic and is being \"covered up by the Allina administration.\"\n\nPhillips served on the board of directors from 2005 to 2011, and while the board advises Allina, it doesn\u2019t \"run the company\" as the ad implies.\n\nThere is also no evidence the note was actually sent to Phillips, and his campaign says he has no memory of receiving such a letter or having any board discussions about the harassment case.\n\nShortly after the ad aired, Lori Peterson, the attorney who represented the women, contacted the Paulsen campaign requesting they take it down.\n\nShe has not gotten a response, Peterson said, and sent the campaign another note Friday.\n\n\"You have been asked, for weeks, to stop using my clients in your ads. You have misrepresented their experiences, lied about your opponent, and further traumatized these women,\" Peterson wrote. \"You have dragged these women into your campaign against their will and you won\u2019t even respond to their requests that you stop.\"\n\nShe goes on to say that her clients want nothing to do with Paulsen\u2019s campaign, and that she has told him repeatedly that Dean Phillips \"had nothing to do with this case. No allegations were made about him and he had no involvement in the litigation.\"\n\nPaulsen attempts to tie Phillips to another Democratic candidate involved in a domestic abuse case and says he \"ignored sexual harassment allegations at his companies.\"\n\nBut Phillips has nothing to do with the accusations against Ellison.\n\nPhillips served on the board of a health organization that was sued over sexual harassment allegations in 2007, but the lawyer in that case said he had nothing to do with it. There is also no evidence that proves he was informed or received a letter about the harassment.\n\nPaulsen\u2019s ad misleads viewers by connecting Phillips to a domestic abuse case he is not involved in, and implies some sort of formal action was taken against Phillips (\"charged with ignoring\") at a company he runs, neither of which are true.", "lang": "en"}
