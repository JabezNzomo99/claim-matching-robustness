The post was shared by nearly 1,920 users.\n\nThe post was also shared by hundreds of individual accounts on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe viral post contains three photos of a woman soldier who, the post said, were martyred and two photos of the cremation ceremony.

Pay tribute by writing Jai Hind..Jai Hind).\n\nIndia Today Fact Check spoke to DIG of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Dinakaran, who confirmed that the message attached to the viral post was completely false as no woman soldier have died fighting on the border in last one year. The officer also confirmed that the CRPF has never deployed women on the Kashmiri borders.\n\nA Facebook profile named Kavita Saini\u2019 also had these images uploaded on her timeline.\n\nThrough Kavita\u2019s Facebook account, India Today Fact Check got a link to another Facebook user\u2019s account which had posted more images of the same woman.\n\nWhen the images were zoomed in, the name on the woman\u2019s uniform badge revealed that her name is Kajal Kumari and not Kavita Saini.\n\nThe district bureau chief of the portal, Suresh Piplodiya told India Today TV that he had received this information from someone in Rajasthan and that he couldn\u2019t confirm the source of the information.\n\nThe remaining two images claiming to be of the soldier\u2019s funeral also do not belong to her. The first one belongs to Lance Naik Hamraj\u2019s funeral who was killed by Pakistani soldiers on the LoC in 2014. The second one dates back to May 2017 when two Nagpur children died a tragic death from electrocution.\n\nIndia Today Fact Check also found that a Twitter account with Kajal Kumari\u2019s name and her pictures in uniform.
