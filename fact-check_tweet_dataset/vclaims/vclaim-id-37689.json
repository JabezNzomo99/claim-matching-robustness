Yet Facebook said the pages and accounts were linked to employees of Sputnik, a government-own and operated news agency based in Moscow.\u201d\n\nFacebook added the pages \u201cfrequently posted\u201d about topics related to anti-NATO sentiment, protest movements and anti-corruption matters.\n\nPosts related to Ukraine, for example, \u201cwere targeted at individual Ukrainian regions/cities,\u201d with a focus on \u201cinflaming news about NATO, [the] Kerch Strait incident, separation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church from Russia [and] local governance,\u201d tweeted Nina Jankowicz, a Global Fellow at the U.S. government-funded Kennan Institute.\n\nOn the same day, Sputnik responded by saying the decision to take down \u201cpages allegedly related\u201d to Sputnik personnel \u201cis clearly political\u201d in nature and \u201cpractically censorship,\u201d noting that \u201cseven [Facebook] pages belonging to our news hubs in neighbouring countries have been blocked.\u201d\n\n\u201cSputnik editorial offices deal with news and they do it well. If this blocking is Facebook's only reaction to the quality of the media\u2019s work, then we have no questions, everything is clear here. But there is still hope that common sense will prevail. Read Sputnik,\" Sputnik's press service said.\n\nThe latest accusations against Sputnik mirror those leveled at the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the so-called Russian troll factory indicted in February 2018 on charges of violating criminal laws with the intent to interfere \"with U.S. elections and political processes\".\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, following a public hearing in November 2017, reported on the IRA\u2019s activitiy on Facebook:\n\u2022 3,393 advertisements purchased (a total 3,519 advertisements total were released after more were identified by the company);\n\u2022 More than 11.4 million American users exposed to those advertisements;\n\u2022 80,000 pieces of organic content created by those pages; and\n\u2022 Exposure of organic content to more than 126 million Americans.\n\nIn October 2016, the U.S. Homeland Security Department and the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s office on election security stated that the intelligence community \u201dis confident that the Russian government directed\u201d election-related hacking of e-mails of political figures in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community in January 2017 directly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering \u201dan influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.\u201d It said the tactics not only included the hacked e-mails but also a social media campaign.\n\nFor Sputnik\u2019s alleged disinfo op, Facebook uncovered 289 pages and 75 related accounts, with the later attracting 790,000 followers.\n\nAround $135,000 in spending for advertisements on Facebook paid for in euros, rubles, and U.S. dollars, were linked to these accounts, with the first running in October 2013 and the most recent this month.\n\nThe pages hosted 190 events, the first being scheduled for August 2015 and the last this month, with \u201cup to 1,200 people having \u201cexpressed interest in at least one of these events.\u201d\n\nFacebook could not confirm if any of the events transpired.\n\nAccording to the Atlantic Council\u2019s Defense Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), \u201cthe effect of these activities was promotion of Rossiya Segodnya (the state-run Russian news agency that launched Sputnik) output to a range of special-interest audiences, without stating their background or affiliation.\u201d\n\n(Note: The Atlantic Council is a non-profit, U.S.-based think tank which receives funding from a variety of U.S and foreign government agencies, companies, and individuals. The organization puts Polygraph.info fact checks on a website dedicated to coverage of international disinformation).\n\nThe network also sought to amplify the video service TOK, which falls under the Rossiya Segodnya umbrella.\n\nDFRLab said the real issue is that most of the pages in the network were covert, having failed to mention a connection to Rossiya Segodnya or any other specific identity.\n\n\u201cIn one case, a sub-group of nine pages in Georgia was run by an account that appeared to be actively fraudulent, in that it claimed to be a young lady from Tbilisi, but took its profile pictures and \u2018personal\u2019 posts from other online sources,\u201d DFRLab said.\n\nDFRLab\u2019s analysis found the Sputnik-linked network had 853,413 followers in aggregate, versus 790,000 detected by Facebook. In any case, DFRLab said that \u201cSputnik\u2019s official pages across the same countries amassed 495,947 followers,\u201d meaning the inauthentic network had \u201cincreased Sputnik\u2019s reach by over 170 percent\u201d across the related countries.\n\nFollowing DFRLab\u2019s research, the Latvian investigative TV show De Facto interviewed the editor-in-chief of Sputnik Latvia, Valent\u012bns Ro\u017eencovs, on the activity. Ro\u017eencovs \u201cconfirmed that Sputnik itself was running the pages,\u201d adding that this was \u201cnormal content promotion.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sputnik\u2019s claim of being censored for operating like any other media agency also belies the agency\u2019s real mission.\n\nMargarita Simonyan who is both editor-in-chief of Rossiya Segodnya and the RT news channel, told Kommersant newspaper in 2012 that Sputnik\u2019s mission was of a military nature, DFRLab previously reported.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re not fighting anyone. But in 2008 we were fighting. The Defense Ministry was fighting with Georgia, but we were conducting the information war, and what\u2019s more, against the whole Western world,\u201d Simonyan said.\n\nThe following year, she reiterated that point to the online news portal Lenta.ru:\n\n\u201cThe information weapon, of course, is used in critical moments, and war is always a critical moment. And it\u2019s war,\u201d Simonyan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a weapon like any other. Do you understand? And to say, why do we need it \u2014 it\u2019s about the same as saying: \u2018Why do we need the Ministry of Defense, if there is no war?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs Polygraph.info noted during its examination of RT\u2019s registration as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d under the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), Russian news agencies are expected to reflect a positive image of the Russian government. In April 2017, the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications presented its 2016 annual report to President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe report stated that the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications \u201cexercised the functions of a state client in financing, controlling and supervising the subordinate entities\u201d in accordance with the president\u2019s address to the Russian Federation Council, in which Putin underlined the \u201cmain directions of the information policy.\u201d\n\nSputnik\u2019s response to the latest influence operation has not been to deny the accounts were run by Sputnik employees, but to characterize their shuttering as censorship.\n\nBased on all of the available evidence, Polygraph.info finds that claim to be false.", "lang": "en"}
