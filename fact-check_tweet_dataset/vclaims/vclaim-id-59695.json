She did not receive enough votes in the March 3 primary to advance to the general election in November, according to election results from The New York Times. On her Facebook page, she describes herself as a \u201cformer political candidate\u201d that \u201cjust concluded\u201d her campaign.\n\nThe California Secretary of State website states only the top two vote-getters for \u201cvoter nominated\u201d offices such as congressional seats advance from the primary to general election. Candidates \u201crunning for a voter-nominated office cannot run in the general election without having been one of the top two vote-getters in the primary election,\u201d according to the website.\n\nPelosi and Buttar, an activist and lawyer, will vie for California\u2019s 12th congressional seat in November, The Intercept reported. Pelosi received 74 percent of primary votes in the district, while Buttar received 13 percent, according to the Washington Post.", "lang": "en"}
