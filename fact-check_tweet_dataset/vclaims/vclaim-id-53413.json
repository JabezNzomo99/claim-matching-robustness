He deserves this. People are dying of hunger and he is enjoying in AC.\u201d The viral post gives the impression that the incident happened recently.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim with the video to be misleading. The incident is two years old when Nitish Kumar\u2019s convoy was attacked in a village in Bihar\u2019s Buxar district while he was on a statewide tour.\n\nThe 2-minute-30-second video shows a convoy of SUVs and police jeeps passing through a village when it comes under attack. One of the police jeeps is seen crashing into a house as people standing on the roadsides pelt the convoy with stones and bricks. Policemen are also seen retaliating by throwing stones and beating up people. There are visuals of injured cops too.\n\nAmong others, Facebook page \u201c\"RJD Chhatra Yuva Neta Prem Pawan Yadav\"\u201d shared the video which was viewed more than 3.4 million times and shared over 36,000 times till this story was filed. The archived version can be seen here .\n\nUsing related keywords, we found that the same video was uploaded on the Facebook page of \u201cNews18\u201d on January 13, 2018. The attack was carried out a day before.\n\nAccording to the \u201cNews18\u201d video, the incident happened in a village called Nandan in Bihar\u2019s Buxar district during Nitish Kumar\u2019s \u2018Vikas Samiksha Yatra\u2019, aimed at taking stock of the state government\u2019s developmental schemes.\n\nWhile the chief minister escaped unhurt, several security personnel in the convoy were injured in the stone-pelting. According to reports, some people wanted Nitish Kumar to visit their village to highlight the lack of amenities, but their request was turned down which made them angry.\n\nThe incident was widely covered in the media .\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the video of the attack on Nitish Kumar\u2019s convoy is two years old. The incident did not take place recently during the lockdown. According to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, Bihar reported 831 cases of coronavirus and six deaths till May 13 evening.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Old pic of KCR\u2019s Ramadan gift for Muslims goes viral with misleading claim", "lang": "en"}
