It has been tweeted on January 11, the day Gandhi arrived in Dubai. Another tweet of January 3 by Rukshmani Kumari, member of Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee, shows Rahul Gandhi on a massive billboard with the words RG@UAE.\n\nPhotofunia is a photo editing website with a large collection of templates for representing photographs in an interesting and unique manner. Among the various templates or \u2018effects\u2019 as the website calls it, is the \u2018billboard\u2019 effect. Here, photographs of individuals can be superimposed on the template to create an impression of presence on a billboard.\n\nThe above image has been created using the City Billboard effect, while the image posted below has been conjured using another effect, Billboards at Night.\n\nInsofar as the image of Gandhi\u2019s poster on the bus is concerned, Alt News used Yandex and came across the original image on a blog called The Purple Journal. The image is indeed of a bus in Dubai, but there is no Rahul Gandhi poster on the back windshield.\n\nThese images were earlier debunked by Boom Live. Earlier, a digitally created video was shared widely by Congress supporters on social media to show how Rahul Gandhi\u2019s image had been beamed on the Burj Khalifa.", "lang": "en"}
