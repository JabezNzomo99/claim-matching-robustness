This is misleading; many hospitals have prohibited visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, but across Canada medical facilities have exceptions allowing a parent or guardian to be with pediatric patients.\n\n\u201cIf your child gets this virus their going to hospital alone in a van with people they don\u2019t know to a room they don\u2019t know to be with people they don\u2019t know,\u201d warns a poster that was shared on social media as a photo on March 25, 2020. \u201cThink about it. Stay In,\u201d the post adds.\n\nHowever, this post is misleading and hospitals AFP contacted in Canada allow visits from one parent or guardian.\n\nWith more than 20,000 confirmed cases on April 23, 2020 the French-speaking province of Quebec is by far the hardest hit in the country, despite having implemented some of the most drastic confinement rules in Canada, with intercity movement forbidden.\n\nBryan G\u00e9linas, a spokesman for Quebec\u2019s largest hospital network, the CHU de Qu\u00e9bec-Universit\u00e9 Laval, told AFP by email, \u201cNo policy corroborates this publication.\u201d\n\n\u201cA COVID-19 positive minor can be accompanied by a parent,\u201d G\u00e9linas added. However, a parent would then also be considered COVID-19 positive and would be confined in the child\u2019s room.\n\nRestricting visitors is necessary as the virus is mainly transmitted by respiration and physical contact, and a patient can already be contagious even before the first symptoms appear.\n\nIn the central province of Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous and second most affected by the pandemic with more than 12,000 confirmed cases, rules are not as drastic. At Sick Kids, a pediatric hospital in Toronto, new rules for COVID-19 stipulate that \u201conly ONE adult caregiver per patient is allowed in the hospital.\u201d\n\nGillian Howard, a spokeswoman for the University Health Network, which oversees four hospitals in Toronto, said that \u201cif you are in close contact with someone who is COVID positive, you would be asked to wear a mask while in the hospital, and self-isolate at home.\u201d\n\nIn the western province of Alberta, although provincial health authorities have mandated that no visitors will be permitted to visit patients, there are several exceptions to the rule, including for pediatric patients.\n\nOnly one visitor is allowed at a time, but the Alberta Health Services COVID-19 web page specifies that \u201cthe unit manager/charge nurse may, in rare situations, approve two visitors at one time on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Alberta had 3,400 confirmed cases.\n\nSimilarly, the British Columbia\u2019s Children Hospital in Vancouver allows only one adult caregiver for outpatient clinics, two adult caregivers for in-patient areas, and one adult caregiver visit for children in the emergency department.\n\nAlthough British Columbia was one of the first areas affected by the pandemic in Canada, its number of confirmed cases is stable at just over 1,700.\n\nProvincial health authorities declined to share the ages of COVID-19 patients in their jurisdiction. A report by the Canadian Paediatrics Society on the novel coronavirus in children mentions that symptoms in children are similar to those in adults \u201cnamely fever, dry cough and fatigue.\u201d\n\nThe same flyer circulated in the US, where AFP Fact Check also found it to be misleading.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 365 examples of misinformation about the novel coronavirus crisis.", "lang": "en"}
