Kennedy Jr., the son of former President John F. Kennedy.\n\nWhile FBI records released in 2000 detail at least three kidnapping threats against John F. Kennedy Jr., there is no evidence Biden was involved in these plots or any others.\n\nThe viral post cites \u201cdeclassified FBI files\u201d as its source for the claim that Biden was involved in a plot to kidnap John F. Kennedy Jr. at some point.\n\nThe Associated Press obtained 162 records from the FBI through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2000. Those records, which appear to be referenced in the Facebook post, show that John F. Kennedy Jr. was the target of at least three kidnapping threats during his lifetime.\n\nOne threat occurred in 1972, when he was in elementary school. The others occurred in 1985, two years after he graduated from Brown University, and in 1995, four years before he died in a plane crash at the age of 38, according to the FBI records.\n\nMany of the details surrounding the kidnapping plots are redacted, but none appear to indicate Biden had involvement in any of them. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Leak The Identities Of SEAL Team 6?)\n\nBiden is mentioned in the FBI records as a \u201cvictim,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times. In August 1994, the then-senator received a threatening letter from Worcester, Massachusetts, that began, \u201cDear Sen. Biden, You are a traitor.\u201d It was signed, \u201cJohn F. Kennedy Jr.\u201d\n\nThe FBI analyzed the handwriting and pulled fingerprints from the letter, but eventually closed the case without identifying any suspects, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nJim Ellis, a former FBI agent and certified fraud examiner, told In Touch that he does not believe John F. Kennedy Jr. sent the letter to Biden.\n\n\u201cThe FBI investigates these [types] of things all the time and 99 percent are from cranks,\u201d he told In Touch. \u201cIf somebody really means to do harm to a senator or congressman, they typically don\u2019t telegraph their intentions.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any credible reports online that Biden was ever involved in a plot to kidnap John F. Kennedy Jr. either.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
