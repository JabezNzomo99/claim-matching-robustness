No longer being able to get away with tax avoidance & evasion is what Brexit is about\u201d\n\nA widely-shared tweet by the broadcaster Terry Christian claims that the EU is bringing in a law in 2020 which will mean anyone with an offshore account will have to \u201ccome clean\u201d and potentially have their income taxed. Avoiding this, he claims, is \u201cwhat Brexit is about\u201d. The tweet has been shared over 10,000 times, and screenshots of it have also circulated on Facebook.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly which law Mr Christian is referring to\u2014there are a couple of laws he could mean. However, we can\u2019t find any interpretation of this claim that would make it correct.\n\nWe\u2019ve found two sets of EU laws (relating to tax avoidance and money laundering) that we think he could be referring to, as at least some parts come into place in January 2020. However, neither of these forces the owners of offshore accounts to \u201ccome clean\u201d as the tweet describes.\n\nThere are some new EU laws on tax avoidance\n\nOne possibility is that he is referring to the EU\u2019s new \u201canti tax avoidance directive\u201d, the last part of which has to be applied in member states by 1 January 2020 (although it\u2019s unclear if they will still take effect if we leave with no deal at the end of October).\n\nHowever, its purpose is not to reveal money hidden in offshore accounts.\n\nThe directive has five key legal aspects relating to:\n\u2022 limiting interest (capping the amount of tax deductible interest a company can have),\n\u2022 the rules around exit taxation (the taxes on companies when they leave a country),\n\u2022 the rules around controlled foreign companies (to stop the diverting of profits to low-tax countries),\n\u2022 general anti-abuse rules (to counter \u2018aggressive tax planning\u2019 that doesn\u2019t necessarily break any specific rules), and;\n\u2022 rules on hybrid mismatches (when companies exploit the differences between countries\u2019 tax systems).\n\nBroadly, the new directive is intended to prevent corporate tax avoidance practices, and has been planned since 2015. It \u201caims to address situations where corporate groups take advantage of disparities between national tax systems\u201d to reduce the amount of tax they have to pay.\n\nIn practice, this aims to tackle large companies shifting profits from the EU country in which they were made to a country with a lower tax rate or \u201cpreferential\u201d rules. This could be another EU country, or a non-EU country.\n\nSo these policies are about tightening up \u201csystemic issues\u201d to do with tax law in EU countries, to make it harder for companies to practice what the EU calls \u201caggressive tax planning\u201d.\n\nMost of these policies are already in place\n\nThree of the five provisions of the new tax avoidance directive are already in place, with EU countries (including the UK) having to adopt them by 31 December 2018.\n\nHMRC told us that the new EU rules on interest restriction and the general anti-abuse rule led to no changes in the UK, because the UK\u2019s existing rules already met or exceeded the minimum standards set.\n\nThere were some minor changes made to controlled foreign companies rules, but none were expected to have any significant impact on individuals or the economy.\n\nThe two EU provisions not yet in place are on exit tax and hybrid mismatches. The UK must meet the EU\u2019s new standards on these by the start of 2020.\n\nHMRC told us the exit tax rules would lead to two \u201cminor\u201d changes.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible Mr Christian was referring to another EU policy coming into force next January: the fifth anti-money laundering directive. This will require member states to put mechanisms in place to identify ownership information on bank and payment accounts and safe-deposits. The EU told us that this does not cover bank accounts held outside the EU.", "lang": "en"}
