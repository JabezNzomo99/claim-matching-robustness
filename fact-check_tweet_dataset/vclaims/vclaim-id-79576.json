The security work is not part of the sheriff\u2019s budget.\n\nClarke, however, has asserted his authority to help provide security.\n\nIn March 2013, that during an \"integrity check,\" an undercover sheriff's deputy with a gun cleared security checkpoints at all six entrances into the county courthouse complex. He said that, as a result, he had ordered deputies posted at each security checkpoint in the complex until \"he is convinced weapons cannot get through.\" He said the staffing would be paid for with overtime.\n\nWhen we checked the entrances one afternoon in June 2014, we found two county employees manning each checkpoint and a deputy nearby. At one checkpoint, we saw a deputy actively working the metal detector; but at the others, a deputy was only observing.\n\nOur colleagues who regularly visit the courthouse told us the same: usually they see deputies merely observing, but occasionally actively working a checkpoint.\n\nFor his part, Clarke told us the deputies are not posted at the checkpoints to watch the screeners.\n\n\"The deputies are there to provide an armed presence for the protection of the public and employees, and to prevent and deter an armed person from getting into the building,\" he said in an email.\n\nThere\u2019s no dispute that overtime pay is being used, at least in part, to pay deputies to work security checkpoints at the courthouse complex. But the amount is not clear.\n\nBased on overtime reports the Sheriff\u2019s Office submits to county officials, it\u2019s not possible to tell how much in overtime pay is being spent on deputies working security checkpoints at the courthouse complex, said county Auditor Jerome Heer.\n\nOverall, the sheriff\u2019s overtime expenditures have gone over budget.\n\nIn 2013, the Sheriff\u2019s Office spent $5.9 million for overtime, exceeding the $3.6 million overtime budget, Heer said. As of June 23, 2014, he said, overtime expenditures were $2.7 million, which is on pace to exceed the overtime budget of $4.1 million.\n\nChisholm said Clarke has \"deputies collecting overtime while sitting passively in chairs watching courthouse security personnel work.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no dispute that part of the sheriff\u2019s overtime budget pays deputies to work security checkpoints at the courthouse complex. The deputies typically are observing visitors passing through the checkpoints, but sometimes get actively involved in screening them or monitoring metal detectors.\n\nTo comment, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.", "lang": "en"}
