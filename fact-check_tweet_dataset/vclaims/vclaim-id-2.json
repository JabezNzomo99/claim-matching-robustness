What goes around comes around. #FridayFeeling\u201d resurfaced on social media recently. The image, a low-definition screenshot of a tweet by a user with an account named \u201cFed Up American\u201d, claims Tlaib tweeted and then deleted the content.\n\nThe link here, which has already been deleted and is only available as a preview on Facebook, has over 100,000 shares and according to Crowdtangle, has been posted in at least 500 Facebook groups and pages, as of February 18, 2020 (some examples here and here).\n\nThis claim is false, Congresswoman Tlaib did not tweet this. This tweet, which resurfaced on social media several times, was originally posted by an impostor\u2019s account on January 9, 2019. While it has the same profile picture and a similar handle to Tlaib\u2019s actual account, there are several indications that help us conclude this is not an authentic tweet.\n\nThe account does not have the blue check next to the handle, which is how Twitter distinguishes verified accounts, such as Tlaib\u2019s. \u201cThis account twitter.com/RashidaTlaib is verified as designated by the blue check viewable in the account profile\u201d, a Twitter spokesperson told Reuters. According to Twitter, the \u201cblue verified badge on Twitter lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic\u201d (see here) and these blue checks must be applied by Twitter themselves.\n\nAfter this fake content resurfaced on social media earlier this year, Tlaib tweeted about this lack of blue check: \u201cQuick public servant announcement: If there isn't a checkmark next to my name on the tweet then it's fake!\u201d (see here).\n\nThe user featured in the claim @RashidaTIaib uses the capital letter \u201ci\u201d to look like a lowercase \u201cL\u201d, which is visible if one copy and pastes the \u201cimpostor\u201d account into Word and change the caps.\n\nThe account had only 10 followers on the date the tweet in the claim was generated, according to this archive snapshot of the profile archive.fo/XvWcN. Tlaib\u2019s authentic account had 280,000 followers at the time (see archive.fo/XvWcN). The fake profile has been deleted.\n\nFed Up American (see twitter.com/bpadj), the account featured on the screenshot, has already explained on Twitter several times that she immediately deleted the retweet \u201cwithin hours\u201d when she realized it was made by a \u201cfake account\u201d (examples here and here).\n\nFalse: Rashida Tlaib did not tweet \u201cAmericans have spent decades raping and pillaging her people\u201d, this was tweeted by an impostor\u2019s account.", "lang": "en"}
