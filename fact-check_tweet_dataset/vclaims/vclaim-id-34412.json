The Census Bureau says this is a hoax.\n\nIn recent days and weeks, Facebook users have flagged several suspicious posts that purport to share an \u201cUrgent Community Notice\u201d for \u201cUSA residents\u201d about the \u201cupcoming census.\u201d The bogus notice says that would-be robbers posing as \u201cofficials\u201d from the \u201cDepartment of Home Affairs\u201d are going door-to-door to confirm \u201cthat everyone has a valid ID\u201d for the 2020 census.\n\nThe Census Bureau says this is a hoax.\n\nThere is no \u201cDepartment of Home Affairs\u201d in the United States government, and there is no \u201cvalid ID\u201d required to take the 2020 census.\n\nAs part of its efforts to combat misinformation about the 2020 census, the U.S. Census Bureau has created a web page to dispel rumors and an email address (rumors@census.gov) for people to report suspicious social media content. On its website, the bureau says of the \u201cUrgent Community Notice\u201d for U.S. residents: \u201cThis is a hoax that originated overseas.\u201d\n\nThe rumor apparently originated in South Africa, which does have a Department of Home Affairs. On Sept. 2, the South African agency issued a statement on Twitter warning its residents of a \u201csocial media scam.\u201d\n\nThe scam now targeting U.S. residents is particularly insidious because it leaves the mistaken impression that U.S. residents may need \u201ca valid ID\u201d for the 2020 census. That is false, and potentially could discourage U.S. residents from participating in the decennial census, which counts every person living in the U.S. regardless of legal status and citizenship.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, census employees are in neighborhoods across the country as they prepare for next year\u2019s census,\u201d the Census Bureau says. \u201cHowever, census employees are not asking the public for any identification.\u201d\n\nThe Census Bureau goes on to say: \u201cBesides not asking the public for any identification, the Census Bureau will never ask you for your Social Security number, your bank account information, your credit card numbers, or for money and/or donations during the 2020 Census.\u201d\n\nPeople with questions about the identity of census takers or general questions about the survey can call the bureau at 800-923-8282.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
