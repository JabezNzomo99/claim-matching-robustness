The Putin Tomorrow article fits that mold, claiming that the \u201cMinistry of High Technologies\u201d posted an announcement on their official website that they would be banning the development of, and investment in, this cellular technology, while citing someone named Nobunari Kabato as that ministry\u2019s head:\n\n\u201cWe need to think about the health of the Japanese. Our country has already accelerated economically so that today we have nowhere to hurry. It is necessary to stabilize this state. 5G is fraught with great danger. So we think not only we, yesterday this information was confirmed by the US ambassador to Japan. If America, China or the EU countries are ready to risk their people for the sake of progress, then such a strategy is unacceptable for our welfare state, \u201dsaid Nobunari Kabato, Minister of High Technologies.\n\nAt least three reasons exist why the above assertion is baseless. First, \u201cNobunari Kabato\u201d appears to be a made-up name: The only Google search result for it is the article we are presently debunking. Second, no \u201cMinistry of High Technology\u201d exists in the Japanese government. The closest entity to that would be the \u201cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology,\u201d which is run by a man named K\u014dichi Hagiuda. Finally, and contrary to the headline claim in the article, Japan is actively investing in 5G technology.\n\nIn fact, Japanese companies are actually investing in what the Nikeii Asian Review described as a \u201d14 [billion dollar] spending blitz for nationwide 5G.\u201d In April, that outlet reported that \u201cJapan\u2019s government \u2026 approved plans by four mobile network operators to build superfast fifth-generation wireless networks, with investment set to total 1.6 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) over the next five years.\u201d As such, we rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
