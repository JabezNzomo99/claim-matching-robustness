The headline on a Georgia Farm Bureau web page touts, \"Georgia Agriculture \u2013 The state\u2019s $71 billion industry.\"\n\nA bullet point underneath is a bit more nuanced. \"Agriculture contributes more than $71.1 billion annually to Georgia's economy,\" it reads.\n\nThe distinction matters, as we\u2019ll get to in a minute.\n\nBut before we get into semantics, we have to delve into some economics.\n\nWe contacted the farm bureau, which directed us to the 2013 Ag Snapshot published by the Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development at the University of Georgia.\n\nThe center conducts an annual survey which allows farmers to report acreage, yield, crop price and other details.\n\nThe 2013 report \u2013 which looks at 82 commodities using 2011 data \u2013 concludes the direct economic value of agriculture is $13 billion.\n\nTwo pages later, it concludes that direct value, combined with the values along the supply chain from fertilizer and seed to first-line processing plants, \"generated a total economic impact of $71.1 billion\" for Georgia.\n\nCenter officials told us they add to the the $13 billion what the actual economic value (using federal data compiled by a private firm) of the businesses along the ag supply chain. In 2011, the tally was $44 billion.\n\nIt then induces a multiplier, adding in what workers in all of those jobs spend on daily living, to arrive at the $71 billion figure.\n\n\"We are looking at the contribution of all the sectors related to agriculture,\" said center economist Sharon Kane. \"It\u2019s so much more meaningful to report the overall impact.\"\n\nThe IMPLAN Group LLC, the North Carolina firm that operates the input-output modeling system and provides the figures for ag-related sectors, did not return calls to confirm data.\n\nWe also contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to try to verify the agriculture numbers. It couldn\u2019t, exactly.\n\nThe agency\u2019s Economic Research Service division can offer only somewhat comparable data in its Farm Income and Wealth Statistics tables.\n\nAccording to that division, Georgia\u2019s net valued added by farms in 2011 was $2.9 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge difference from between the $13 billion that farmers reported. Definitions account for part of the gap \u2013 Georgia counts timber, nurseries and agriculture tourism such as hunting licenses, while the federal agency does not.\n\nBut even then, there is at least a $9 billion gap between state and federal figures.\n\nTo make sense of that gap, and the calculations themselves, PolitiFact Georgia reached out to Bruce Seaman, an economist who studies economic impacts of projects and industries.\n\nSeaman, a professor of economics at Georgia State University, said the varying definitions of agriculture likely accounts for much of the massive gap in the figures.\n\nMore concerning, he said, is the mixing of \"impact\" and \"contribution\" when throwing around the $71 billion figure.\n\nThe Agribusiness report answers the question of how much activity is going on in agriculture and its related industries.\n\nThat is the industry contribution, Seaman said. It is a snapshot of the industry, which shows agriculture makes up about 10 percent of the overall state economy.\n\nThat\u2019s very different than saying it has the same impact, or importance, he said.\n\nConsider: In 1905, about a third of all jobs in the United States were in agriculture. But Seaman said that did not mean those jobs had a proportional impact on the overall economy, or the United States would have collapsed as jobs moved into manufacturing.\n\n\"It describes how much activity is linked to an industry,\" he said. \"But it does not mean that if the agriculture industry declined by half, the economy would suffer a $35 or $36 billion loss.\"\n\nSo, looking at the big picture, is agriculture Georgia\u2019s largest industry?\n\nThink of it as a pie (pecan, of course. Made in Georgia).\n\nBased on the state and federal data \u2013 and adding in sectors that are directly linked to growing cotton and raising broilers \u2013 the $71 billion figure might be a bit too high, but can be mostly verified.\n\nBut that figure is simply agriculture\u2019s slice of the pie that is Georgia\u2019s economy.\n\nIn this study, making ag\u2019s slice smaller or larger doesn\u2019t make the pie any bigger.\n\nAgriculture is the largest single component in the state economy. But it requires another type of study to know its actual economic impact.\n\nThe Georgia Farm Bureau statement is accurate, but needs some additional context to fully understood.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
