According to Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), a group of protesters broke away from a peaceful demonstration and attempted to breach the border fence, while several others hurled solid objects at CBP agents. In response, CBP launched tear gas into Mexico against the demonstrators in a moment captured in vivid detail by Reuters photojournalist Kim Kyung-Hoon, whose photograph of a mother and two children fleeing a canister of tear gas immediately went viral:\n\n\ufeffIt was in this context that right-wing commentator and Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren quote-tweeted actor and activist Alyssa Milano, who had angrily rebuffed President Trump with the accusation that he had \u201ctear-gassed women and children \u2026 on Thanksgiving weekend.\u201d In Lahren\u2019s tweeted response, she characterized this same incident as the highlight of her weekend:\n\nThe controversial tweet was soon encapsulated in meme form, with the most prominent iteration stemming from liberal commentator John Pavlovitz, who paraphrased Lahren\u2019s tweet as her expressing that \u201cwatching children being hit by tear-gas\u201d was the highlight of her weekend:\n\nWhile the meme did not allege that Lahren said those words exactly as stated (as evidenced by the judicious use of quotation marks), some viewers interpreted it as reproducing an exact quote, which it did not. However, as Lahren\u2019s tweet was issued in direct response to someone\u2019s discussing \u201ctear-gassed women and children \u2026 on Thanksgiving weekend,\u201d it was not a wholly inaccurate paraphrase.", "lang": "en"}
