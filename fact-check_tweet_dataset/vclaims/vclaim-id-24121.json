However, instead of a clip video, photographs of the PM at the same event were used.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe clip used to propagate that the Prime Minister spent Rs 80 lakh on beauticians has been picked up from the video showing the making of PM Modi\u2019s wax statue in Madame Tussauds, Singapore. The clues are hidden in the video itself.\n\nAt about 8 seconds into the video, a paper reads out \u2013 \u2018Madame Tussauds Body Measurement.\u2019\n\nThe video of the making of PM Modi\u2019s wax statue was uploaded in 2016. The claim that beauticians were applying make-up on the PM is false as Madame Tussauds employees can be seen taking his body measurements.\n\nMoreover, no such RTI revealing that PM Modi spends Rs 80 lakh a month on beauticians was found in media reports. The social media claims are, therefore, false.", "lang": "en"}
