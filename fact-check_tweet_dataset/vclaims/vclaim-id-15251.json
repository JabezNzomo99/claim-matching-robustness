Killings have been a regular feature of the State so much so that, there have been calls for the declaration of a State of Emergency in the State.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government, Professor Abdullahi Shinkafi, lamented on Monday while receiving relief materials donated to the State by the wife of the President, Aisha Buhari:\n\n\u201cAs at now, 5,000 lives had been lost, about 9,000 people injured and several thousands were displaced; about 500 villages affected across the 14 local government areas of the State through these unfortunate attacks.\u201d\n\nThe video of the claim ascribed to Nasir El-Rufai has been shared by over 5,000 people on their Facebook page alone, through a news site, Scannews, which is fast gaining reputation as the first site to go to for fake news. It was thereafter shared on the popular Nairaland site; shared on Naijaloaded, and also by a Lagos- based newspaper, Nigerian Bulletin.\n\nThe Governor was alleged to have said:\n\n\u201cWe apply military force; we think we can resolve insurgency; it is not going to happen. I have been in Government, I ran a territory, and I know the amount of information I get, security reports that I get, as Minister.\n\n\u201cThe President gets 50 times that. And I put it to you, and I challenge anyone, including the DG SSS to this; who these insurgents are\u2026 the President knows them,\u201d El-Rufai was alleged to have said in the video.\n\nHowever, DUBAWA checks showed that although El-Rufai appeared in the video that went viral, it wasn\u2019t a recent video; in fact, he was not talking about President Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the interview had been conducted in May 2013, six years ago, long before he became the Governor of Kaduna State. The interview, tagged STRAIGHTTALK, was aired on Television Continental (TVC).\n\nMany Nigerians, especially in the Northern part of the country have experienced incessant violent attacks, leading to the loss of lives and limbs and rendering many homeless.\n\nIt is therefore not only reckless but also callous, to cook up stories capable of fanning the embers of war.\n\nConclusion: Governor El-Rufai of Kaduna State, didn\u2019t say President Muhammadu Buhari knows those behind the Zamfara killings.", "lang": "en"}
