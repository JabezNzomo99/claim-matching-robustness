Both stories are false and were rightly flagged as such by Facebook users.\n\nThe headline on the story claiming that Sharia is now the law of the land nationwide says: \u201c9th Circuit Court Betrays America: Sharia Law Now Legal In All 50 States.\u201d\n\nIt originated on Reagan Was Right, a self-described satirical website that says it tries to fool conservatives. Its \u201cabout\u201d page says: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d But other sites that posted the story had no such disclaimer.\n\nThe original story\u2019s opening line says: \u201cThe liberal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals extended their session to 10 PM eastern last night to finalize their ruling to overturn a case that essentially makes Sharia Law legal in America.\u201d\n\nThere is a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and it does have a reputation among conservatives as being liberal. But everything else the story says about the court was completely made-up.\n\nFor example, the story quotes a fictional \u201clegal analyst\u201d named \u201cProfessor Art Tubolls,\u201d who was referred to in other stories on the same site as a \u201ccorrespondent\u201d and a \u201cpublicist.\u201d It also refers to a nonexistent law clerk for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nWe checked with the Supreme Court, and \u201cBobby Mulvaney\u201d does not work for Roberts. The legal website Above the Law posted the names of his current clerks here.\n\nThe fact is, 11 states prohibit the use of foreign or religious laws in their courts, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals hasn\u2019t done anything to change that.\n\nThe headline on the second story wrongly proclaims: \u201cSharia Law Now In Full Effect In One State After What Judge Gave Muslim Rapist Special Permission To Do.\u201d\n\nThat story was originally published by Freedom Daily, a conservative website that says: \u201cWe post and decipher content to a level that is consistent with a common sense approach and falls in line with the ideals of American liberty and freedom.\u201d\n\nThe site describes the story\u2019s author, whose byline appears as Prissy Holly, as a \u201cprofessional shi*t starter.\u201d Holly wrote a story based on a kernel of truth and distorted it beyond recognition.\n\nIn reality, Mohammed Ali Mohammed, a Somali refugee, served six years in a juvenile detention center after pleading guilty to raping two women in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 2011 when he was 14, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. In November, a Utah judge sentenced Mohammed \u2014 now almost 21, and too old for a juvenile facility \u2014 to probation instead of time in state prison.\n\nBut Freedom Daily spun that story into an anti-Islamic diatribe that starts this way: \u201cAmerican citizens continue to feel the devastating effects where Muslim refugees have been allowed to invade\u2026 Now it appears as though Sharia Law in a state of Utah is in full effect, after the sickening thing that Muslim refugees are now allowed to do to American women without any fear of legal repressions.\u201d (The emphasis is the website\u2019s own.)\n\nThe story \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 says that the state trial court judge, Vernice Trease, decided \u201cto let the Muslim go free apparently because he was a Muslim.\u201d It also falsely says: \u201cOne of the pillars of Islam is raping non-Muslim women.\u201d\n\nActually, the five pillars of Islam are: professing faith, praying five times a day, giving to charity, fasting for Ramadan and making a pilgrimage to Mecca. And Trease didn\u2019t let Mohammed off completely free, either.\n\nAs we said, he was sentenced to five years of probation, and he has to wear an ankle monitoring device, among other restrictions. Trease said she \u201cwon\u2019t bat an eye\u201d at sending him to prison if he violates his probation in any way, the Tribune reported.\n\nIn addition, two images published side-by-side at the top of the story on Freedom Daily have nothing to do with Mohammed\u2019s case.\n\nOne is a 2015 photo of refugees at a train station in Munich, Germany, and the other is a photo from the scene of a 2015 accident in which a Los Angeles police sergeant was hit by a car while investigating a late-night robbery.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201c9th Circuit Court Betrays America: Sharia Law Now Legal In All 50 States.\u201d Reaganwasright.com. 28 Nov 2017.\n\nWheeler, Russell. \u201cTrump wants to \u2018break up the Ninth Circuit.\u2019 How would that help him?\u201d The Brookings Institution. 16 May 2017.\n\nZapotosky, Matt. \u201cFederal appeals court rules 3 to 0 against Trump on travel ban.\u201d Washington Post. 9 Feb 2017.\n\n\u201cSharia Law Now In Full Effect In One State After What Judge Gave Muslim Rapist Special Permission To Do.\u201d Freedom Daily. 30 Nov 2017.\n\nMiller, Jessica. \u201cA 14-year-old Somali refugee raped two Utah women in 2011.
