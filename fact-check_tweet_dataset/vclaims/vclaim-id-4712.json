It\u2019s difficult to measure the extent that one is causing the other.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-4712", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/universal-credit-driving-people-food-banks/", "vclaim": "This is correct according to the Trust\u2019s own research.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t prove that Universal Credit has caused an increase on this scale, and the Trussell Trust itself says it isn\u2019t the only benefit people at food banks are experiencing issues with. There\u2019s wider evidence that people have had problems during the rollout of Universal Credit and that some have been going to food banks as a result.\n\nUniversal Credit is a new working-age benefit that is replacing a lot of existing social security benefits like income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance and Housing Benefit. It\u2019s currently being rolled out in stages across different parts of the UK, and all existing claimants of the old benefits are expected to be moved to the new system by 2022.\n\nConcerns have been raised that delays in moving claimants over to Universal Credit or administration problems may be causing some people to use food banks. The Trussell Trust is the UK\u2019s largest network of food banks.\n\nResearch shows a correlation between increased food bank use and early rollout areas for Universal Credit\n\nThe Trussell Trust confirmed to us from its own research that: \u201canalysis of 38 foodbanks in our network that have been in full Universal Credit rollout areas for a year or more shows that these projects experienced an increase of 52% in the twelve months following the full rollout date in their area.\u201d\n\nThe Trust said it added up data from individual food banks in areas of the UK where Universal Credit had been rolled out and compared the change in usage after a year. The average increase was 52%.\n\nMeanwhile using a random sample of 247 food banks in areas without Universal Credit, or those where the rollout had only just started (for at most three months) the average increase was 13% over equivalent periods. We don\u2019t know how these averages vary across different food banks.\n\nThe National Audit Office has observed separately steeper increases in food bank use in three of the four areas it looked at where Universal Credit is being introduced.\n\nAs we\u2019ve looked into before, it\u2019s as important to know what food bank figures don\u2019t tell us as what they do.\n\nThe Trussell Trust doesn\u2019t run all food banks in the UK, for instance, so these findings are specific to the cases they\u2019ve been able to measure.\n\nThis is also still early days. We know that\u2014by definition\u2014the rollout areas covered in the study are among the earliest to receive Universal Credit. The benefit is currently claimed by an estimated 920,000 claimants and is expected to reach over eight million in total.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how much of an impact Universal Credit is having on food bank use, but it isn\u2019t the only factor\n\nThe research showing a 52% increase can\u2019t on its own prove that Universal Credit is the main driver of increased food bank use, though it\u2019s still likely to be a major factor.\n\nThe Trussell Trust has done wider work asking some of its users about their experience of Universal Credit and why it led them to use a food bank. This gives an insight into the problems some people are facing, and why they went to a food bank. But it isn\u2019t necessarily a representative sample of Trussell Trust food bank users as a whole, which the Department for Work and Pensions has drawn attention to.\n\nThe evidence from its referral agencies suggests in 2017/18 a growing proportion of referrals to food banks are because benefit payments aren\u2019t seen to be covering the costs of essentials.\n\n28% of referrals for which the Trust has data were due to \u2018low income\u2019\u2014for which benefits were a significant factor\u2014followed by benefit delays (24%) and benefit changes (18%).\n\nAs the Trussell Trust also points out: \u201cUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at food banks are experiencing issues with\u201d. Research has also suggested people on disability benefits are more likely to visit food banks.\n\nThese figures won\u2019t reflect the full impact of recent changes\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions told us: \u201cThe reasons why people use food banks are complex, so it\u2019s wrong to link a rise to any one cause\u201d. It went on to say \u201cUniversal Credit is working for the vast majority who claim it\u201d.\n\nThe DWP also points out that the research, covering 2017/18, won\u2019t reflect the impact of all of the changes introduced earlier this year to provide extra support to claimants and allowing access to a full month\u2019s advance payment while waiting for an award. We won\u2019t know what effect these have had until more research has been done and those changes have had time to bed down.\n\nThe DWP\u2019s own research shows that significant numbers of claimants report experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nIt told us that 83% of claimants are satisfied with the service they receive, which is correct for people on the \u2018live service\u2019\u2014a temporary part of the rollout in some areas that has more restrictions on who can claim, as opposed to the \u2018full service\u2019.\n\nBut as the National Audit Office drew attention to this week in an argument with the Secretary of State, it\u2019s also the case from the DWP\u2019s research that 40% of claimants on the \u2018full service\u2019 surveyed report experiencing significant financial difficulties eight to nine months into their claim.", "lang": "en"}
