A reverse image search also showed the original News5 graphic. News5 social media manager Agatha Sayurin also told Rappler that they did not produce the false quote card.\n\nMeanwhile, on his Instagram account, Martin did not post anything about Mas. Moreover, no news organization reported on Martin issuing this remark.\n\nRappler also reached out to News Blog Radio to ask for their source, but received no response as of writing.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation arrested Mas on May 11. He faces charges of inciting to sedition related to cybercrime as well as violation of Republic Act No. 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.\n\nIn the past, Rappler also debunked other false claims about celebrities, including one that said Angel Locsin \"tested positive\" for coronavirus and another that said Bamboo Ma\u00f1alac died in March. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
