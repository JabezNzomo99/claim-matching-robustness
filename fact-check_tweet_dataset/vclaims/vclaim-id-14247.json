No, that's not true: in recent days several fake Ellen Facebook pages and profiles were created that are being used by scammers to harvest likes, shares and comments to make their pages or profiles appear more popular in Facebook's algorithm. Some of the pages are also being used to spread dodgy links to suspicious websites.\n\nAn example of the scam can be seen in this post (archived here). Many of the posts have a variation of following text:\n\nMost of the scam pages use short video clips of the real Ellen, often totally unrelated to any giveaway or contest.\n\nThe real Ellen DeGeneres Facebook page can be found here:\n\nIf you see an Ellen contest or giveaway on Facebook and it isn't coming from that page it is most likely fake. You should also keep an eye out for the blue verification checkmark next to the name of the page or profile: if that is missing it means it is not the real page.", "lang": "en"}
