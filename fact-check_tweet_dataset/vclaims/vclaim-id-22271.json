{"title": "Ex-Finance Minister: Russian Share of Global Economy Shrinking", "subtitle": "While Russia's place among the world's big economies varies, depending on exchange rates and price comparisons for goods, the IMF finds the nation's total contribution to the global economy is falling.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "February 14, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-22271", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-role-global-economy/29040200.html", "vclaim": "In 2017 Russia\u2019s economic growth, based on Rosstat\u2019s first estimate, equaled 1.5% or a quarter less the government\u2019s recent forecasts. It is only slightly better than the pre-2013 crisis trends.\n\nHowever, if we disregard growth declines of the last three financial crises in the country, these growth rates turn out to be minimal in the last 20 years. At the same time, the global economy is demonstrating growth rates almost 2.5 times higher:\n\nRussia\u2019s exact place in the global economy depends on the way the growth of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is calculated. Converted into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate, based on the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) estimate, Russia is outside of the first top ten countries:\n\nLooking at the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) in national currency (by doing price comparison of the same goods and services in different countries), the group of leading countries, according to the IMF, looks different. In 2014, it was led by China ahead of the United States. Russia took the sixth place.\n\nWe have put both numbers together in one graph that demonstrates how Russia\u2019s contribution to global GDP has been changing since the beginning of the new century. This is exactly what the ex-Minister of Finance was talking about:", "lang": "en"}
