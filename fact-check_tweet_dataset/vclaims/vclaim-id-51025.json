The photo is being shared in a misleading context; it was actually taken in Indonesia following the Mt. Sinabung eruption in May 2016.\n\nThe photo was shared on Twitter here on January 13, 2020, one day after the Taal volcano began emitting billowing clouds of ash.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cI live near Tagaytay area & friend of mine from Manila keep asking me last night to evacuate and go their place. My reaction was \u201cI can\u2019t leave my 4 dogs\u201d PLEASE PEOPLE IF YOU ARE GOING TO EVECUATE BRING YOUR PETS WITH YOU!!!\n\nTagaytay is a city that sits on a ridge overlooking Taal.\n\nTens of thousands of people living in areas near the volcano have been forced to flee since Taal began spewing ash and lava on January 12, 2020, with many abandoning their livestock and pets, AFP reported here.\n\nReactions to the tweet suggest many thought the photo of the dog was taken in the aftermath of Taal\u2019s eruption.\n\nOne angry comment states in a mix of Tagalog and English: \u201cThis is heartbreaking!!! There really are people who would put themselves first & have the audacity to leave pets/animals behind. Those people are infuriating!!!\u201d\n\nAnother comment states: \u201cOK, now I won\u2019t sleep worrying about this dog. What is wrong with people? Dogs wouldn\u2019t leave us behind.\u201d\n\nA third reaction reads: \u201cDID SOMEONE SAVE THIS DOG? PLEASE. ANYONE?\u201d\n\nBelow are screenshots of the comments:\n\nThe same photo of the ash-covered dog was also shared in several other Twitter posts about Taal, for example here and here.\n\nBut the photo is being shared in a misleading context; reverse image searches on Yandex found that the photo was taken in May 2016 in Indonesia and was originally published here by Anadolu Agency (AA), a Turkish news agency.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the AA photo:\n\nThe photo\u2019s caption reads: \u201cKARO, INDONESIA - MAY 22 : An injured dog covered in volcanic ash crouches down in an empty village after it was abandoned following the eruption of Mount Sinabung at the Gamber Villages, in Karo, North Sumatra, Indonesia on May, 22. 2016. At least seven people were killed and two other were seriously wounded after Mount Sinabung volcano in North Sumatra province of western Indonesia erupted on Saturday, disaster agency official said here. ( YT Haryono - Anadolu Agency )\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the AA photo (R):\n\nThe photo is accurately captioned in this report by the Daily Mail, a UK-based publication.\n\nOn Facebook, the photo was also shared alongside images of an ash-covered cat and fowl in this misleading post, which does not explicitly mention Taal but was published on January 13, 2020.\n\nReverse image and keyword searches found that the photo of the cat was in fact taken by Reuters in 2008 following a volcano eruption in Chile.\n\nThe photo of the ash-covered fowl appears to have been taken in the Philippines after the Taal eruption and was shared on Twitter here by MovePH, the civic engagement arm of Philippine news organization Rappler, on January 13, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
