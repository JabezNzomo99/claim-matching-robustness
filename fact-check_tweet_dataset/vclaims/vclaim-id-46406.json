However, it is unclear what informed his decision to peg the exchange rate at 6 cedis to 1 dollar.\n\nNeither the Bank of Ghana interbank exchange rate nor forex bureau rate, following our checks, pegged 1 dollar to 6 cedis on June 1. The Bank of Ghana interbank exchange rate (mid-rate) for June 1 was 1 dollar to 5.62 cedis.\n\nThe date of receipt, exchange rate volatility and transaction charges are factors expected to impact the exact amount to enter government coffers. The Controller and Accountant General\u2019s Department meanwhile has refused to provide GhanaFact with the necessary details including the Ghana cedi equivalent of the amounts received in dollars from the various sources.\n\nAt the Finance Ministry, Chief Director Patrick Numo confirmed, \u201cit is true we[Ghana] got 100 million dollars from the World Bank, 1.250 billion cedis from the stabilisation fund, 1 billion dollars from the IMF and 5.5 billion cedis from the Bank of Ghana,\u201d but added it was the Controller and Accountant General\u2019s Department that could confirm the exact figures that had entered government coffers.", "lang": "en"}
