A day after the meeting, Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat and co-author of the plan with Graham, claimed Trump used an obscenity to describe African nations and made disparaging remarks about Haitian immigrants.\n\nDurbin quoted the president as saying of African nations, \u201c\u2018Those shitholes send us the people that they don\u2019t want.'\u201d Durbin continued, \u201cHe repeated that. He didn\u2019t say that just one time.\u201d Durbin also quoted Trump as saying, \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t need more Haitians.'\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Graham reportedly told his fellow Republican senator from South Carolina, Tim Scott, that the media reports about Trump\u2019s language at the meeting were \u201cbasically accurate,\u201d according to Charleston\u2019s Post and Courier.\n\nTrump issued a vague denial. In a Jan. 12 tweet, he said: \u201cThe language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used,\u201d without explaining which remarks he denied making or what exactly he said at the meeting. Talking to reporters in Florida two days later, Trump said of the remarks attributed to him: \u201cThey weren\u2019t made.\u201d On Jan. 15, the president tweeted that Durbin \u201ctotally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting.\u201d\n\nThere were at least seven members of Congress at the meeting and one administration official, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Five members of Congress and Nielsen have made public statements about the meeting. Here\u2019s what each of them has said so far.\n\nThe Illinois Democrat told reporters in Chicago on Jan. 12 that the president described African countries as \u201cshitholes.\u201d Durbin confirmed what the Washington Post had reported earlier that day.\n\nDurbin, Jan. 12: As Sen. Graham started to read the plan, the president started making comments and asking questions, and that\u2019s when things deteriorated rapidly. When we talked about those in the United States on temporary protected status, there was comment that they were from El Salvador and Honduras and Haiti. \u201cHaitians,\u201d he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t need more Haitians.\u201d Then we went on and the president started commenting on immigration from Africa. And that\u2019s when he used those sickening, heartbreaking remarks, saying, \u201cThose shitholes send us the people that they don\u2019t want.\u201d He repeated that. He didn\u2019t just say it one time\u2026. It was clear that the president had rejected our bipartisan plan and told us to go back to work and find something else\u2026. I cannot imagine that in the history of that room, that hallowed room, where the president of the United States goes to work every day there has ever been a conversation quite like that. It was vile. It was hateful. It was racist.\n\nTold that the president denied saying the words attributed to him, Durbin said, \u201cIt speaks for itself. There were witnesses. There were 12 of us in the room. I was the only Democrat who was in that room, but I\u2019m hopeful that Republican senators will step up and confirm what I just told you. It happened. I\u2019m saying it because it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nLater that day on MSNBC, Durbin also said that Graham confronted the president over his remarks at the meeting. Durbin said Graham exhibited \u201cextraordinary political courage.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina Republican senator put out a statement on Jan. 12 in response to Durbin\u2019s remarks, saying, \u201cI appreciate Senator Durbin\u2019s statements.\u201d Graham did not contradict Durbin\u2019s account, but he didn\u2019t explicitly confirm it, either.\n\nGraham, Jan. 12: Yesterday Senator Durbin and I met with President Trump at the White House to discuss our bipartisan proposal on border security and immigration. Following comments by the President, I said my piece directly to him yesterday. The President and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel. I\u2019ve always believed that America is an idea, not defined by its people but by its ideals. The American ideal is embraced by people all over the globe. It was best said a long time ago, E Pluribus Unum \u2013 Out of Many, One. Diversity has always been our strength, not our weakness. In reforming immigration we cannot lose these American Ideals. The American people will ultimately judge us on the outcome we achieve, not the process which led to it. I know the bipartisan proposal discussed at the White House can get a lot of support from both sides. As always, I look forward to considering additional ideas that could make the proposal even better. I appreciate Senator Durbin\u2019s statements and have enjoyed working with him and many others on this important issue. I believe it is vitally important to come to a bipartisan solution to the immigration and border challenges we face today. I am committed to working with Republicans and Democrats to find common ground so we can move forward.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s junior senator, Republican Tim Scott, was not at the meeting, but he told the Post and Courier that he spoke to Graham about media reports of Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201cshitholes.\u201d Scott said that Graham told him the media reports were \u201cbasically accurate,\u201d according to the Post and Courier, without elaborating on what Graham specifically told him.\n\nThe two Republican senators initially put out a joint statement on Jan. 12 that said they \u201cdo not recall the President saying these comments specifically.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, both senators elaborated on their statement during appearances on Sunday talk shows.\n\nCotton reiterated on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that he did not hear Trump use the language attributed to him. However, Perdue, appearing on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d told host George Stephanopoulos that Durbin had grossly misrepresented Trump\u2019s remarks, saying \u201cthat language \u2026 was not used.\u201d\n\nPerdue, Jan. 14: Then in Thursday we had a meeting, and coming out of that meeting, we heard a gross misrepresentation of what happened in that meeting. But it\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve had a gross misrepresentation by that individual. Stephanopoulos: Well, let\u2019s get into \u2013 let\u2019s get into that. Perdue: No, let me finish, George. Stephanopoulos: Well, I want to know what the gross misrepresentation was. Perdue: \u2026 the gross misrepresentation was that language was used in there that was not used, and also that the tone of that meeting was not contributory and not constructive\u2026. Stephanopoulos: \u2026 you\u2019re saying flat out, definitively, the president did not say those words? Perdue: I\u2019m saying that this is a gross misrepresentation, it\u2019s not the first time Senator Durbin has done it, and it is not productive to solving the problem that we have at hand. Stephanopoulos: Senator Durbin has been very clear. Senator Graham has told others that the reports were basically accurate. Are you saying the president did not use the word that has been so widely reported? Perdue: I\u2019m telling you he did not use that word, George. And I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s a gross misrepresentation. How many times you want me to say that?\n\nOn the same program, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake was asked if he believed Perdue. Flake said he learned of Trump\u2019s disparaging comments a day before the public learned of them.\n\n\u201cWell, all I can say is I was in a meeting directly afterwards where those who had presented the president our proposal spoke about the meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they \u2014 they said those words were used before those words went public. So that\u2019s all I can tell you is I \u2014 I heard that account before the account even went public.\u201d\n\nShortly after Perdue\u2019s interview, Cotton appeared on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and was asked about Perdue\u2019s remarks by host John Dickerson.\n\nCotton, Jan. 14: Yeah, John, I didn\u2019t hear that word either. I certainly didn\u2019t hear what Senator Durbin has said repeatedly. Senator Durbin has a history of misrepresenting what happens in White House meetings though, so perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by that. Here\u2019s what I did hear. And here is the point. Dickerson: Sorry to interrupt. You didn\u2019t hear the word, or it was not said? Because Senator Graham also told Senator Scott, your Republican colleague, that this is what happened. Senator [Jeff] Flake was in a subsequent meeting right afterwards where he was told by people in the meeting this happened. So just to button that up, you\u2019re saying it did not happen or you just don\u2019t recall? Cotton: I didn\u2019t hear it, and I was sitting no further away from Donald Trump than Dick Durbin was. And I know\u2013 Cotton: And I know what Dick Durbin has said about the president\u2019s repeated statements is incorrect.\n\nNational Review Editor Rich Lowry, who was not at the meeting, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he was told Trump \u201cused a different, but very closely related vulgarity. He said s-house, and not s-hole.\u201d\n\nA day later, the Washington Post reported, based on accounts from anonymous White House officials, that Perdue and Cotton told the White House that they heard \u201cshithouse\u201d rather than \u201cshithole,\u201d which the Post wrote allowed both men \u201cto deny the president\u2019s comments on television over the weekend.\u201d\n\nGraham appeared to criticize Cotton and Perdue for their selective memories of the meeting. \u201cMy memory hasn\u2019t evolved,\u201d he told reporters in South Carolina on Jan. 15. \u201cI know what was said and I know what I said.\u201d\n\nAt an event in Chicago on Jan. 15 to mark Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Durbin said: \u201cI know what happened. I stand behind every word that I said in terms of that meeting.\u201d\n\nDiaz-Balart would neither confirm nor deny whether Trump used the obscenity at the meeting to describe African nations.\n\nThe Florida Republican issued a Jan. 12 statement via Twitter saying he did not want to be \u201cdiverted from all possible efforts to continue negotiating to stop deportations,\u201d without addressing the president\u2019s reported remarks.\n\nOn Jan. 14, Diaz-Balart\u2019s spokeswoman issued a statement saying the congressman \u201chas NEVER repeated, stated, or leaked what is said in private meetings.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Nielsen told host Chris Wallace that there was an \u201cimpassioned conversation\u201d on immigration at the meeting, but she did not hear \u201cthat specific phrase being used.\u201d\n\nWallace, Jan. 14: Secretary, you were in that meeting in the Oval Office. Did the president say that? Nielsen: I don\u2019t recall him saying that exact phrase. I think he has been clear and I would certainly say undoubtedly the president will use, continue to use strong language when it comes to this issue. He feels very passionate about it. I think what was frustrating about that meeting for all of us in the meeting was that although the deal presented in theory and approach to the four pillars upon which we had agreed, did not address the core security issues that we need to do our job. And more importantly, there\u2019s nothing in there that would prevent us from getting here again. So, we\u2019re not interested in half measures. We don\u2019t want additional temporary populations here. It\u2019s unfair to them, it\u2019s unfair to American citizens and it certainly raises security risks. Wallace: I don\u2019t understand \u2014 I\u2019m just going to press back on you once on this subject. It seems to me \u2014 you were in the meeting when these comments were made. I can understand you either saying they were said or they were not said. It is pretty shocking language and to say I don\u2019t recall seems implausible. If the president of the United States used the word blank-hole talking about countries in the Oval Office or didn\u2019t say it, I would know. Nielsen: I understand the question. It was an impassioned conversation. I don\u2019t recall that specific phrase being used, that\u2019s all I can say about that.\n\nAt least two other Republicans \u2014 House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Rep. Robert Goodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 attended the meeting, but we have yet to find any statements from either one about Trump\u2019s remarks at the meeting.", "lang": "en"}
