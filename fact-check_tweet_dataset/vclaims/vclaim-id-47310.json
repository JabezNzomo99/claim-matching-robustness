Rather, it was a \u201c3D visualization\u201d of the Australian fires by Anthony Hearsey, \u201can image maker who specialises in photography, retouching and creative imaging,\u201d which was compiled from NASA satellite data collected across the span of a month.\n\nMany postings of this image included a disclaimer noting that the visualization encompassed \u201call the areas which have been affected\u201d by fires in Australia, but that \u201cnot all the areas are still burning\u201d:\n\nAnthony Hearsey himself offered a clarification of what this image represents:\n\nThis is a 3D visualisation of the fires in Australia. NOT A PHOTO. Think of this as prettier looking graph. This is made from data from NASA\u2019s FIRMS (Satellite data regarding fires) between 05/12/19 \u2013 05/01/20. These are all the areas which have been affected by bushfires. Scale is a little exaggerated due to the render\u2019s glow, but generally true to the info from the NASA website. Also note that NOT all the areas are still burning, and this is a compilation.", "lang": "en"}
