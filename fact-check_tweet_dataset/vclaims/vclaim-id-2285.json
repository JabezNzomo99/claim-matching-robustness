Sources differ on how many prizes each country has.\n\nWe ran our own calculations using the Nobel Prize data to find out more.\n\nIf we base it on the country where each Nobel Prize winner (a \"Nobel Laureate\") was born then it's correct that the United States has the highest number of Nobel Laureates with 259, followed by the UK with 99. Germany is third with 91 Nobel Laureates.\n\nBut there are other ways to add up Nobel Laureates by country\n\nFirstly, countries have changed. India was once part of the British Empire but is now an independent state. Rudyard Kipling, born in India under British rule, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907\u2014should we count this as a prize for India or the UK?\n\nSecond, we might prefer instead to look at which country hosted or funded the work, or the nationality of the Nobel Laureate at the time they were awarded the prize, rather than their country of birth.\n\nThird, a Nobel Prize be may be shared by more than one person. If joint work by a British and a Belgian scientist is awarded a Nobel Prize it might be fairer to say that Britain and Belgium each got half a prize. This happened in 2013 when the Nobel prize for Physics was awarded to Professors Peter Higgs and Englert Fran\u00e7ois, and there are many more examples.\n\nUnder this definition, there have been about 61 Nobel Prizes awarded to people born in the UK. This still puts them in second place to the United States\u2019 139 and ahead of third-placed Germany with just under 60.\n\nMaybe we should also make adjustments so that countries of different sizes are compared fairly. For example Luxembourg has two Nobel Prizes with a population of around 580,000 people. That\u2019s one prize in every 290,000 people. Compare that with the UK, which has one prize in every 663,000 people\u2014which sounds much less impressive.\n\nLooking at prizes per capita the UK comes in at 10th, although this still depends on the factors discussed above. Topping the table is Saint Lucia, which has two Nobel winners from a population of just 178,000.\n\nOther things we might want to consider is the number of universities or the amount of research funding each country provides. If we wanted to be really picky, we could take into account the number of people who were ever citizens of the country since the start of the Nobel Prize awards, rather than just the current population.\n\nBut that\u2019s an analysis for another time.", "lang": "en"}
