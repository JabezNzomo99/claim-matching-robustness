It is being claimed to be of the picture of the solar eclipse taken by a British Airways pilot while the plane was crossing the Atlantic ocean.\n\nThe caption with the picture read: \u201cA British Airways pilot clicked this photo of solar eclipse when his plane was crossing Atlantic ocean. One can see another plane on same flight path.\u201d\n\nSeveral other users shared the same picture with the same claim. Such posts can be seen here, here, here.\n\nIn 2017, the same picture was shared by Delhi BJP leader Satish Upadhyay on his verified Facebook page with the same claim.\n\nALSO READ: Did Maharashtra freeze investments worth Rs 5,000 Cr with China? Here\u2019s\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above picture and found that the claim attached to the picture is false.\n\nOn putting the picture through Reverse Image Search, we found the original picture on Shutterstock which does not have a plane.\n\nOn closely analysing the picture, we discovered that the picture is actually a digital artwork and it has been on the internet for years much before the solar eclipse took place on June 21, 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, it is safe to say that the picture in question has no connection with the recent solar eclipse and the claim of British Airways pilot clicking this picture is FAKE.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
