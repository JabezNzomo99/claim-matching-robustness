The former poll chief, who has been in the United States since November 2017, argued he had not received any summons and submitted instead a sworn affidavit in March.\n\n\n\nThe story's content is not an actual news report but a copied May 29 Facebook Live video of Presidential Communications Operations Office social media strategist Trixie Cruz-Angeles. In the video, Cruz-Angeles ventures to explain the status of the Senate\u2019s probe into Bautista\u2019s alleged money laundering activities.\n\nContrary to Cruz-Angeles\u2019 explanation that the arrest order has been withdrawn after Bautista sent his affidavit, the resolution to withdraw the order is still being routed for signatures, according to the office of Sen. Francis \"Chiz\" Escudero. Escudero is chair of the Senate committee on banks, financial institutions and currencies conducting the Bautista probe.\n\nPinoynewsportal.info was created in February 2018.
