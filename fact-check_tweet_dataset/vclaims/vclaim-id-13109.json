It was posted to Facebook by a passenger on that flight and on Indonesian citizen journalist platform, NET Citizen Journalist (and their names are on several versions of the video).\n\nThe Etihad flight went on to land safely.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook. You can read more about this\u2014and find out how to report Facebook content\u2014here. For the purposes of that scheme, we\u2019ve rated this claim as false because the video is not of the Ethiopian Airlines crash but of another flight experiencing severe turbulence which went on to land safely.", "lang": "en"}
