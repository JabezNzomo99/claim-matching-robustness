It talks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged incidents from his childhood. \u201c\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u092d\u093e\u0908 \u092c\u0939\u0928 \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u094c\u0924 \u0915\u093e \u091c\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948 (Modi\u2019s brothers and sister blame Narendra Modi for their father\u2019s death),\u201d the clipping is headlined.\n\nIt says that PM Modi\u2019s father, Damodardas Mulchand Modi, used to make ends meet by pickpocketing and stealing coal and iron from the railway station where he worked as a tea seller. He traded the stolen items for gold, which, in turn, were stolen by Narendra Modi when he was a young boy. His father, unable to cope with his son\u2019s actions, suffered a cardiac arrest. The family could not get back the stolen gold despite lodging an FIR and Damodardas Mulchand Modi subsequently died because his family could afford the medical expenses. The story ends by claiming that former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee suppressed the case and the FIR against Narendra Modi in 1996.\n\nThe elaborate tale is being shared by multiple users on social media.\n\nIt has been shared on Facebook by quite a few users.\n\nThe claim has been floating on WhatsApp as well. The oldest instance of the story that Alt News found was a 2017 post by one Velaram M Patel whose Facebook bio says that he is a member of Congress. Alt News contacted Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s brothers for comments. His elder brother Soma Modi said, \u201cMy father had bone cancer and died in 1989.\u201d He added that Narendra Modi was at Kailash Mansarovar Yatra at the time. \u201cNarendra came back home and gave father prasad from Mansarovar. Father passed away the next day,\u201d he continued. This information was reiterated by PM Modi\u2019s younger brother Prahlad Modi in a separate conversation with Alt News. \u201cThis is completely false,\u201d he asserted. \u201cOur father died in 1989 of bone cancer. Narendra was an RSS pracharak at the time and was home for father\u2019s funeral.\u201d We also contacted the Prime Minister\u2019s biographer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay who gave us information similar to the statements of PM Modi\u2019s family. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge and the conversations I\u2019ve had Mr Modi during the time I was researching for my book, he\u2019d said that his father died in 1989-90.\u201d Posted below are screenshots of excerpts from Mukhopadhyay\u2019s biography of PM Modi \u2013 \u2018Narendra Modi: The Man, the Times.\u2019 According to the book, Narendra Modi left his village and broke away from his family in 1967. He came home for a few hours in 1989 when his father passed away. At another point, the book also says that Narendra Modi had just returned from his pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar when his father was on his death bed. \u201cI gave him sacred water from Mansarovar,\u201d the book quotes PM Modi. It adds that in 1989, when Damodardas Mulchand passed away, Narendra Modi was General Secretary, Organisation of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The approximate date of Damodardas Mulchand\u2019s demise was also stated by the Prime Minister in a 2018 speech when he said that his father died \u201c30 years ago\u201d. PM Modi\u2019s statements and those given by his family members to Alt News are sufficient to debunk the viral clipping. Firstly, the cutout claims that PM Modi\u2019s brothers and sister blame him for their father\u2019s demise, alleging that he died of a heart attack unable to cope with the shock that Narendra Modi stole his gold. This is false as the family members stated that their father died of bone cancer and not cardiac arrest. Secondly, the cutout claims that Damodardas Mulchand passed away when PM Modi was in his childhood. As per his family members, their father died in 1989 therefore, PM Modi could not have been a teenager at the time. The Prime Minister was born in 1950 and would\u2019ve been nearly 40 years of age at the time of his father\u2019s demise.\n\nThere are several clues hidden in the clipping itself which suggest its ingenuity.\n\n1. At first glance, the clipping appears to be a newspaper cutout. But it isn\u2019t. While the story has been aligned similar to articles published in newspapers, the report is not dated. Furthermore, the story gives out information that is not backed by factual data like dates, time and place. It says Narendra Modi stole his father\u2019s gold, however, fails to mention his age or the year of the alleged incident. All that it does is give readers a photograph of PM Modi as a young boy. This could be interpreted as visual manipulation. While the story itself does not reveal his age, the picture causes the reader to infer that the Prime Minister must have been a teenager when the incident took place. Furthermore, the clipping says that his father died of a heart attack. But it does not give away the year of the death.\n\n2. If one tries to look up the alleged incident on Google, the search engine does not throw up any results.\n\n3. There are several spelling errors in the article. For instance, \u2018\u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938\u2019 is written as \u2018\u092a\u094b\u0932\u093f\u0938\u2019 in multiple places. The word \u2018\u092a\u0915\u095c\u093e\u2019 is spelt as \u2018\u092a\u0915\u0921\u093e\u2019. Many sentences in the article do not end with a purn viraam (full-stop) but ellipsis (series of dots).\n\nThe elaborate story of PM Modi\u2019s father being a petty thief and the Prime Minister stealing his gold, causing his father to die of a heart attack, is baseless. There is no evidence to support these claims.", "lang": "en"}
