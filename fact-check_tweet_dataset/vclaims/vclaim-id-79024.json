The topic was government surveillance. But lucky you, we\u2019re not checking a statement related to spying.

Last year it was Lincoln, this year it's Grant. Who knows what is going to happen (next) year,\" he said. \"But ladies and gentlemen, the City of Portland has won more national Constitution contests than any city in America.\"\n\nThe program is called \" We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution Program ,\" and it\u2019s been around since 1987 with its first competition in 1988.

Could there be a rival program that shuts out Portland?\n\nWe asked the people at the , the nonprofit in Oregon that coordinates the state\u2019s We the People program. \"None that I know of. I'd say Earl is RIGHT!\" wrote Barbara Rost, program director, in an email.", "lang": "en"}
