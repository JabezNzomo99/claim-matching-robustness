It comes from an article published on a satire website.\n\nThe image, posted on June 22, appears to show Thunberg, CNN anchor Don Lemon and other members of the alleged panel. The town hall, titled \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like Being Black In America,\u201d is purportedly scheduled for Thursday at 8 p.m.\n\nThunberg first gained global recognition for skipping school to protest against inaction on climate change outside the Swedish parliament, later going on to address world leaders at a United Nations climate summit in New York City. She took all of 2019 off school to continue her campaign by attending school protests and conferences, according to BBC News.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Thunberg is scheduled to participate in such a CNN town hall. No town hall with that title appears on CNN\u2019s schedule of upcoming broadcasts. Nor has she previously appeared in one to that effect, a list of previous CNN town halls shows.\n\nA faint watermark on the right-hand side reveals that the image is actually a screen grab of an article posted on Genesius Times, a satire website that describes itself as \u201cthe most up-to-date, accurate fake news on the Internet.\u201d Unlike the Genesius Times website, the screen grab does not make it clear that the content is satirical in nature.\n\nThunberg most recently participated in a coronavirus-related CNN town hall in May to talk about her activism work during the pandemic, according to the New York Post. She was listed as a climate activist, not an expert panelist, the video of the town hall shows.
