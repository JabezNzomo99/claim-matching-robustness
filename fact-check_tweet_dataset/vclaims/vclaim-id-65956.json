The image used at the top of the story is taken from NBC footage recorded after a shooting at the Capitol on March 28, 2016.\n\nBut FreedomCrossroads.us had a familiar feel to it \u2014 it shared a design template with TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody site responsible for literally hundreds of fake news stories popping up across the Internet.\n\nThat site was run by a man named Christopher Blair, who has told us he was a self-described liberal troll living in Maine. He said his aim was to trick conservatives with absurd and fictional news stories that exposed how gullible they were.\n\nA Whois lookup showed that FreedomCrossroads.us is registered to Blair, and lists information PolitiFact had previously used to contact him. The site was registered on Aug. 18, 2016. Its posts are archived back to March 21, 2017.\n\nWe tried to reach Blair to verify he was the site\u2019s owner but didn\u2019t get any response. The Pelosi post is credited to an author called \"Truth Dealer,\" who is crosslisted as Alan Whitemor.\n\nFreedomCrossroads.us said on its page footer that the site made up its stories. \"Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate,\" it reads.\n\nPelosi did not have any kind of breakdown. The story came from a parody website run by a prolific troll.\n\nWe rate this one Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
