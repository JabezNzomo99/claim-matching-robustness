The claim is false; this photo has circulated in news reports since 2017 about the president\u2019s visit to Marawi, a war-torn city in the country\u2019s south that was then besieged by militants.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on April 18, 2020. It has been shared more than 5,900 times.\n\nIt shows Duterte sitting in a vehicle with Senator Christopher Lawrence \u201cBong\u201d Go, a close presidential aide. Both men can be seen wearing military fatigues.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nPart of the post\u2019s lengthy Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"While others are always yapping, criticising the government the president who is 74 years old with a weak body and immune system more prone to virus that could kill him if he gets hit with it, [he is] making rounds and ensuring the security of us Filipinos. He chose to make rounds on the ground instead of sleep in the air-conditioned Malaca\u00f1ang palace and wait for updates or news from his people.\"\n\nThe post states Duterte and Go are wearing military uniforms because of their respective roles as chief commander of the Philippine military and army reservist.\n\nThe photo was also shared here, here, here, here, here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo has circulated in reports since 2017 about Duterte visiting the Philippine city of Marawi in 2017.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the same photo published here in an August 24, 2017 tweet by CNN Philippines, the Filipino arm of the US-based media channel.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the photo in the CNN Philippines Twitter post (R):\n\nThe photo was also published in this tweet by the Philippine news channel News5 on August 24, 2017.\n\nBoth CNN Philippines and News5 credited the photo to Go.\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, Go told AFP by text message on April 22, 2020 that the claims were \u201cpart of non stop daily fake news\u201d.\n\nMarawi was besieged by armed Abu Sayyaf and Maute militants between May and October 2017, in an operation that Philippine authorities say aimed to establish a Southeast Asian base for the Islamic state group. The five-month armed conflict resulted in almost 1,200 fatalities before it ended on October 17, 2017.", "lang": "en"}
