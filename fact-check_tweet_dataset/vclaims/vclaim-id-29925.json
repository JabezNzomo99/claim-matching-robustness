These generally aren\u2019t correct.\n\nThe post goes on to claim Labour\u2019s manifesto would have ended homelessness, child poverty and food banks, nationalised public services and tackled climate change. Whether it could have achieved all of those aims is a complex question that we won\u2019t address here; but it\u2019s worth noting that, for example, there were questions over whether the policies in the manifesto could have ended child poverty (which wasn\u2019t actually a pledge the manifesto made).\n\nHS2 is the government\u2019s project to build a high-speed railway from London to Manchester and Leeds, via Birmingham and the East Midlands.\n\nIt\u2019s incorrect to say HS2 will cost \u00a3150 billion. The latest estimate is that the scheme could cost \u00a3106 billion, according to an independent review of the project\u2019s costs leaked recently to the Financial Times. The report reportedly still recommends that \u201con balance\u201d the government should proceed with the railway.\n\nSince this article was first written the leaked review has been published by the government. It says that the total cost estimate for HS2 \u201cdeveloped by an external consultant\u201d was \u00a3106.6 billion in 2015 prices.\n\nThe costs are significantly higher than they used to be. Initially, these were estimated as \u00a337.5 billion, but those estimates have risen since then. The government\u2019s 2015 spending review only set aside \u00a356 billion (in 2015 prices) for the project.\n\nThe BBC has reported that cost increases are down to \u201ca mixture of management issues, tricky soil conditions and unrealistic land valuation\u201d, among other concerns.\n\nLabour\u2019s 2019 manifesto, by contrast (assuming the post is referring to the most recent one) set aside about \u00a383 billion of additional day-to-day spending by 2023/24. However it also announced compensation for the WASPI women amounting to an additional \u00a311.5 billion a year. In any case, it\u2019s certainly more than half of the estimated cost of HS2.\n\nAnd more importantly, that\u2019s comparing extra spending every year for Labour\u2019s manifesto with a one-off cost spread over many years for HS2.\n\nLabour\u2019s manifesto also supported completing HS2 anyway, so if the party were in government they would be facing the same budget decisions as the current government.\n\nThe \u00a3150 billion figure seems to come from a report by the Midlands Economic Forum, an independent research forum, in April last year. It said that all three phases of HS2 were estimated to cost around \u00a3106 billion. To this it then added other associated costs to get a figure of over \u00a3156 billion as the total cost of HS2. But there are some problems with its calculations.\n\nBy far the largest part of these associated costs are \u00a343 billion of \u201clocal transport infrastructure connections to HS2 terminals\u201d. It says that this figure was from Sir John Armitt, the chair of the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC).\n\nBut the \u00a343 billion recommended by the NIC didn\u2019t relate to HS2-associated infrastructure connections, but referred to its recommendation for additional investment in urban transport more generally (for towns and cities with populations of over 100,000 people) up to 2040.\n\nSome journeys are expected to be significantly faster\n\nOn the most recent estimates, HS2 will shave more than a \u201cfew\u201d minutes off journey times to and from London. The Department for Transport estimates journey times from Leeds will fall from 131 minutes to 81. From Liverpool they will drop from 134 minutes to 94, and from Manchester from 127 to 67.\n\nOnce the project is complete, HS2 forecasts that around 300,000 passengers a day will use the network.", "lang": "en"}
