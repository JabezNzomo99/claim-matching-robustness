But the pressure has been rising.\n\nOther nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Iran\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to a report by Kenneth Katzman of the Congressional Research Service , which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress.\n\nOil exports, which fund nearly half of Iran\u2019s government spending, have fallen by about half since 2011, from about 2.5 million barrels a day to about 1.25 million. The drop has been driven, Katzman says, by a European Union embargo and U.S. pressure on Iranian oil customers.\n\nIran also lost access to the international banking system.\n\nThe combination has caused a sharp drop in the value of Iran\u2019s currency, the rial, Katzman says. Meanwhile, sanctions helped trigger a recession that\u2019s driving up unemployment.\n\nHas that meant \"30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment,\" as Reich told ABC viewers?\n\nInflation estimates range from . Official unemployment statistics, meanwhile, are out of date, and outside experts question their accuracy, anyway.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development don\u2019t have up-to-date figures for Iranian unemployment.\n\nGary Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has studied sanctions for 30 years, said Reich\u2019s numbers \"seem reasonable.\"\n\nHere\u2019s how the Congressional Research Service put it in June:\n\nInflation: 30 percent plus, according to Iran Central Bank in May 2013, but believed to be over 50 percent by outside experts.\n\nUnemployment rate: Official rate is 15.3 percent as of the end of 2011, but outside experts believe the rate is higher.\n\nReich pointed us to news articles from the and energy news site \u2014 which offer some support for his numbers while highlighting the uncertainty.\n\nThe Associated Press reported in June inflation \"over 30 percent,\" though it cited a 14 percent unemployment rate. OilPrices.com noted Sept. 19 that analysts outside the country found that unemployment rate \"impossible to believe,\" and quoted an estimate from Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian-born economic adviser to the European Union, of more than 20 percent. (The OilPrices.com report echoes a Reuters report from the .)\n\nSo \"reasonable\" seems like a fair assessment for Reich\u2019s numbers.\n\nWe should also note there\u2019s not universal agreement on the size of sanctions\u2019 role in all that financial pain, which experts also attribute to Iran\u2019s .\n\nReich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley with a background in economics, told PolitiFact it just makes sense unemployment and inflation would follow a slash in oil exports.\n\n\"The typical consequence for a nation dependent on exports when those exports are cut is high inflation and high unemployment,\" he said.\n\nMichael Malloy, a professor at the University of the Pacific\u2019s McGeorge School of Law who specializes in banking regulation and economic sanctions, told PolitiFact \"it's likely to be a much more complicated picture.\"\n\nReich told ABC viewers that under economic sanctions, \"now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation\" and \"20 percent unemployment.\"\n\nIran\u2019s own statistics aren\u2019t widely trusted and international organizations don\u2019t have recent unemployment figures. But those numbers fall within a broad range of expert estimates cited by news reports and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Iran\u2019s economic struggle has been exacerbated by its own economic policies and other factors, not just sanctions. Still, there\u2019s good evidence they\u2019ve had a \"huge impact,\" as Reich said. We rate his claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
