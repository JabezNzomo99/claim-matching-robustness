But New York state remains on the higher end of that range.\n\nThat\u2019s what WKBW-TV, Buffalo\u2019s ABC affiliate, reported on April 27, citing the American Automobile Association.\n\n\"New York is one of only 12 states where the average gallon of gas costs more than $2.00, according to numbers provided by the AAA of Western and Central New York,\" the report said.\n\nIs that correct? Yes.\n\nWe asked AAA for the gas price data for April 27, and they provided us with the full list of 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The data comes from surveys of up to 120,000 gas stations across the country.\n\nWe looked at the price per gallon for unleaded regular. Here\u2019s the list of states, from most expensive to least expensive:\n\nAccording to this list, New York, at $2.18 a gallon, was the seventh most expensive state for gasoline, trailing Hawaii, California, Washington state, Oregon, Nevada, and the District of Columbia. (D.C. isn\u2019t a state, but we\u2019ll grant some leeway.)\n\nThe other five states with gas prices above $2.00 were Arizona, Pennsylvania, Utah, Alaska, and New Jersey. That adds up to 12 states above $2.00, as the statement said, as long as you include D.C. as a state.\n\nThree states had gas below $1.40 a gallon: Ohio, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin.\n\nAAA isn\u2019t the only source of this data. We also looked at data from the wesbite GasBuddy.\n\nGasBuddy sent us their own state-by-state prices from April 27 and it shows a similar pattern, but slightly different due to data sampling.\n\nNew York, at $2.13, was one of eight states with gas prices above $2.00. In descending order, they were Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington state, Nevada, New York, Arizona, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThat\u2019s fewer than the 12 states that AAA found with $2.00-plus gasoline, but four additional states on the GasBuddy list had prices just under $2.00. Utah, Alaska, the District of Columbia, and New Jersey all had gas prices at between $1.95 and $1.95.\n\nOne reason why gas prices are relatively high in New York is the tax burden, according to an interactive map produced by the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nIn 2018, New Yorkers paid more than 45 cents a gallon in state taxes and 18 cents a gallon in federal taxes, for a total of 63 cents a gallon. That\u2019s nearly twice what Ohio motorists pay in taxes. New York is one of just a handful of states where motorists pay more than 49 cents a gallon in gasoline taxes.\n\nSince the article appeared, the situation hasn\u2019t changed much.\n\nBy the following week, only 10 states had average gas prices above $2.00 per gallon, and New York remained one of them.\n\nWith some states beginning to re-open portions of their economies, gasoline prices have increased slightly in some states, according to AAA and GasBuddy data. But the average price per gallon in the United States had only risen a couple of cents per gallon,\n\nIn New York, the changes were also minimal. AAA had New York\u2019s average price per gallon at $2.15, while GasBuddy had a slightly lower price, $2.12.\n\nA news report cited the American Automobile Association in saying that \"New York is one of only 12 states where the average gallon of gas costs more than $2.00.\"\n\nAAA provided us the full data, confirming that the statement is correct, as long as the District of Columbia is counted as a state. Among the 50 states and D.C., New York ranked seventh highest in per-gallon prices for regular unleaded.\n\nAnother gasoline price metric, from GasBuddy, had eight states above $2.00, with four additional states between $1.95 and $1.99.", "lang": "en"}
