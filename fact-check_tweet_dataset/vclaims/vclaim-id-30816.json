This found that middle-aged people in the poorest third of households became more likely to report a life-limiting illness or general poor health between 1979 and 2011. Meanwhile, the experience of the richest third hardly changed. In other words, the health of poorer people had got worse, and the gap between them and the richest had grown wider.\n\nHealth inequality is real, and several studies provide evidence that the gap between the richest and poorest is widening.\n\nBut Dr Jivraj\u2019s research does not say that people on low incomes are objectively in worse health than a generation before, as suggested by the press.\n\nMeasuring how many people report poor health does not necessarily tell you how healthy they are. We know, for example, that life expectancy rose substantially in the 20th and early-21st centuries, including for people on low incomes and people doing unskilled manual work. This suggests that the general health of the whole UK has improved.\n\nThe research paper itself says that different generations might report illness and disability in different ways, because \u201cthose in lower-income groups born later\u2026 [could] have greater expectations of their own health\u201d. By contrast, the oldest people in the study grew up before the foundation of the NHS.\n\nIt is also possible that some middle-aged people in poor health today might have died before reaching middle-age in the past, thereby making previous generations of middle-aged people look healthier than they actually were.\n\nDr Jivraj did not take account of this in his research, but said when we contacted him that he thought the effect would be small. We\u2019re going to look into this issue in more depth, and will update this article if necessary.", "lang": "en"}
