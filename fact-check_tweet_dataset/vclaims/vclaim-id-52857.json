No, that's not true: the story originated as a joke on a Christian-themed satire website and it referenced \"booksellers across the country\". But because it used a digitally altered photo of a notice in a Barnes & Noble bookstore many people believed the story to be real and the image started to lead its own life online.\n\nThe story originated as an an article published by The Babylon Bee on June 12, 2020 titled \"Bibles Pulled From Shelves For Outdated Idea That All Humans Are Of One Race And Made In The Image Of God\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe story was accompanied by an image of a sign using the Barnes & Noble logo:\n\nThe sign was photoshopped over a stock photo titled \"Chicago, USA - September 10, 2018: Barnes and Noble bookstore interior\" taken by Anton Gvozdikov.\n\nMany people apparently believed the picture or the story were real, causing a sharp uptick in searches for \"barnes and noble bible pulled\" according to Google Trends:\n\nThe story prompted a reaction from the bookstore: they posted a note (archived here) to their Facebook page explaining that the Babylon Bee was a satire website:\n\nThe Babylon Bee is indeed a satire site with following disclaimer on the 'about' page:\n\nThe Babylon Bee is the world's best satire site, totally inerrant in all its truth claims. We write satire about Christian stuff, political stuff, and everyday life. The Babylon Bee was created ex nihilo on the eighth day of the creation week, exactly 6,000 years ago. We have been the premier news source through every major world event, from the Tower of Babel and the Exodus to the Reformation and the War of 1812. We focus on just the facts, leaving spin and bias to other news sites like CNN and Fox News. If you would like to complain about something on our site, take it up with God. Unlike other satire sites, everything we post is 100% verified by Snopes.com.\n\nAt Lead Stories we are big fans of satire but in accordance with our Satire Policy we sometimes fact check satirical content if it seems there are many people who don't get the joke (or if the joke gets stolen by Macedonian fake news sites and is then presented as \"news\"). To quote from our Satire Policy:\n\nSometimes jokes need to be fact checked. Not for you, because you are smart and you get the joke. But for the crazy uncle who thinks it is real. Or for the foreign journalist who doesn't know what The Onion is. Or for the people who missed the disclaimer and the hints. Or because the disclaimer and the hints were hidden on purpose.\n\nAnd that is certainly not hypothetical in the case of The Babylon Bee:\n\nEarly in 2020 Sputnik News was fooled by a piece from The Babylon Bee into reporting Jordan Peterson would be hosting the Oscars. If only they had read our fact check from a year before...", "lang": "en"}
