Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of a burqa-clad Muslim woman being denied a food kit for being a Muslim. Fact: The woman in the video was not denied food rations. Rajeev Mishra (the man distributing food rations in the video) has sent other video and photos to FACTLY, where it can be seen that the woman was given rations. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the posted video, at 25 secs, it can be heard that the name of the man distributing food rations is \u2018Rajeev Mishra\u2019. So, when searched with his name and other keywords, another Facebook video (posted by \u2018UPKhabar\u2019) with more information regarding the man in the video was found.\n\nWhen searched with the available details, the Facebook profile of \u2018Rajeev Mishra\u2019 (President of \u2018Mamatha Charitable Trust\u2019 and \u2018General Secretary of BJP Uttar Pradesh\u2019) was found. He has posted the same video (a longer version) on his profile on 16 April 2020. Even in that video, the video gets transitioned to another visual when the woman comes to receive the food kit; making people believe that she was denied food rations. When FACTLY contacted Rajeev Mishra for clarification on the video, he denied the false claims and shared another video and photos from the event with FACTLY. In the video and photos, it can be clearly seen that the burqa-clad woman has received food rations.\n\nAlso, Rajeev Mishra told FACTLY that they do not discriminate against people based on religion. More videos and photos of him distributing food kits to Muslims can be seen on his Facebook profile. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, the burqa-clad Muslim woman in the video was not denied food rations.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
