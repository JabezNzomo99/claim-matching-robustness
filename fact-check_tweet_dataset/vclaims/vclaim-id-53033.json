NO SOCIAL DISTANCE.\"\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at that part of the claim.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\n\nDid Democratic leaders including Pelosi huddle up as pictured without standard COVID-19 precautions?\n\nPelosi has been a strong proponent of mask-wearing (in contrast to Trump\u2019s refusal to wear one in public).\n\nTwo days before this Facebook post, CNN quoted her as saying a federal mandate on mask wearing is \"long overdue.\"\n\nA New York Times story from a month earlier said Pelosi has \"relentlessly, and strategically, made masks a part of her platform.\"\n\nSo the allegation of hypocrisy here is noteworthy, particularly with the supposed photographic proof.\n\nBut the picture is not what it seems.\n\nThe image, taken by Andrew Harnik of the Associated Press, dates to Dec. 18, 2019. It shows Pelosi speaking with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal after the House voted to impeach President Trump, the original caption says.\n\nAt that point, the COVID-19 outbreak was just beginning in Wuhan, China. The first case in the U.S. wasn\u2019t confirmed until more than a month later. The first stay-at-home order enforcing social distancing wasn\u2019t imposed until March 2020, in California.\n\nSo, of course, Pelosi and the others pictured would not be social distancing or wearing masks.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll note, Pelosi has been very conscious of mask and social distancing recommendations.\n\nWhen joined by other Democrats at a recent news conference, the dozens of lawmakers were spaced for social distancing. House committee meetings have been held virtually, and for in-person meetings, masks have been the norm. What\u2019s more, Pelosi consistently wears a mask when appearing in public.\n\nA Facebook post shows Pelosi and other Democratic leaders huddled together, criticizing them for not wearing masks or following social distancing guidelines.\n\nBut the image is from December 2019, months before masks and distance became part of the national response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCiting it as proof in a dramatically different landscape eight months later is ridiculous, particularly when Pelosi has actually been a strong supporter of mask-wearing and social distancing for herself and the Congressional body she oversees.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
