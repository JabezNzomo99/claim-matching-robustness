Thank you to everyone who sent us quotes for checking via Twitter using hashtags #FactCheck and #QandA, on Facebook or by email.\n\nJACQUI LAMBIE: First of all, we\u2019ve always had climate change \u2013 it\u2019s been much, much hotter and much, much colder. Even 110,000 years ago, it was four degrees hotter. Charging our pensioners and our businesses and families more for power\u2026 TONY JONES: There\u2019ll be fact checkers on that one, Jacqui\u2026\u2013 Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, speaking on Q&A with host Tony Jones, February 13, 2017\n\nWith renewable energy, heatwaves and climate change back in the headlines, Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie told Q&A that it was four degrees hotter 110,000 years ago.\n\nIs that right?\n\nWhen asked for sources to support her statement, a spokesman for Jacqui Lambie referred The Conversation to Al Gore\u2019s book An Inconvenient Truth and Tim Flannery\u2019s book The Weather Makers.\n\nThe spokesman confirmed that Lambie was referring to 4\u2103, not Fahrenheit, and added:\n\nThe detailed response from Lambie\u2019s office, which is available here, included a chart from Gore\u2019s book An Inconvenient Truth, which Lambie\u2019s office had annotated. That chart is based on data from Antarctic ice cores. A response that The Conversation sourced from Tim Flannery on Lambie\u2019s representation of his work can also be found here.\n\nMost non-scientists probably think in terms of \u201cwarmer than today\u201d or \u201ccooler than today\u201d.\n\nHowever, much of the science on this compares past and projected temperatures to a pre-industrial baseline, not to the temperature today in 2017. That\u2019s because temperatures now are rising too rapidly to serve as a useful baseline. (Industrialisation began in the late 18th century, and the world has warmed by about 1\u2103 since then).\n\nIn this FactCheck, we will talk about both: comparing to pre-industrial levels and comparing to today.\n\nWas it \u2018much, much hotter\u2019 and \u2018much, much colder\u2019 in the past?\n\nLambie was right to say that the Earth\u2019s climate has always changed and that, at different times, Earth has been hotter and colder than today.\n\nThe past 650,000 years of Earth\u2019s history (the interval shown in the annotated chart provided by Lambie\u2019s office) was characterised by large climate swings as Earth moved naturally in and out of \u201cice ages\u201d triggered by changes in its orbit relative to the Sun.\n\nInitial cooling, brought on by slow changes to the shape of the Earth\u2019s orbit and wobble of the Earth\u2019s axis, was amplified by natural effects, including the growing ice sheets and the drawing down of carbon dioxide into the deep oceans. Over tens of thousands of years these amplifying feedbacks caused Earth\u2019s climate to descend into an ice age.\n\nAt the peak of the last ice age (around 20,000 years ago), Earth\u2019s global average temperature is estimated by scientists to have been about 5-6\u2103 cooler than it was during the pre-industrial interval.\n\nSo, yes, it is fair to describe the ice ages as much, much colder than now. But were the warm periods of the last 650,000 years \u201cmuch, much hotter\u201d?\n\nNo. The warm climates of the so-called \u201cinterglacials\u201d \u2013 meaning the period between ice ages \u2013 were similar to today. A few of these periods were a little bit hotter; some were a little bit cooler.\n\nNone had a global average temperature that was 4\u2103 warmer than either today or pre-industrial times (we will return later to what the data say about local average temperatures).\n\nHow warm was it 110,000 or so years ago?\n\nThere was a warm interglacial period around 130,000 to 115,000 years ago, before the last ice age.\n\nThis last interglacial period was one of the warmest periods of the past 650,000 years. But it wasn\u2019t 4\u2103 hotter globally.\n\nExtensive scientific evidence from across the globe shows that the global average temperature during this interglacial period was 1-2\u2103 warmer than pre-industrial times (or about as warm as it was in 2016).\n\nThis evidence comes from natural climate archives, including the tiny marine organisms that accumulate as sediment on the bottom of the oceans and whose chemical makeup fluctuates with surface ocean temperatures, and the water molecules in ice cores that reflect air temperatures over the polar regions.\n\nThe last time Earth\u2019s average temperature was 4\u2103 warmer than pre-industrial levels was around 5-10 million years ago. To put that in context, modern humans have existed for the last 200,000 years and civilised societies began to form only around 6,000 years ago.\n\nWhile the global average temperature during the last interglacial period was 1-2\u2103 warmer than pre-industrial times, in some places like Antarctica and Greenland local warming resulted in temperatures as high as, or even higher than, 4\u2103 warmer. These more extreme local temperature changes near the poles are referred to as polar amplification.\n\nScientists have used ice-core data to calculate that during the last interglacial period Antarctica was around 3-5\u2103 warmer than it was during pre-industrial times. But global average temperatures were not 4\u2103 warmer.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThe fact that Earth has experienced natural climate changes in the past doesn\u2019t downplay the significance of how humans are changing the climate now.\n\nThe vast amounts of coal, oil and gas burned since the Industrial Revolution in 1750 has caused the levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to rise very significantly.\n\nNatural climate variations have continued to be a factor in Earth\u2019s climate since the Industrial Revolution, but the rapid rise in carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases) has been the dominant cause of climate warming during the industrial era.\n\nIn 2016, the planet\u2019s average surface temperature had risen to be about 1.1\u2103 warmer than in the late 19th century, when instrumental records began. This places our climate today at a similar global average temperature to the last interglacial.\n\nWhen global average temperatures were 1-2\u2103 warmer than pre-industrial times between 115,000 and 130,000 years ago, this caused so much of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets to destabilise and melt that sea level rose by 6-9 metres.\n\nIt takes time to melt an ice sheet. But in some parts of Antarctica, climate warming since the Industrial Revolution has already triggered unstoppable changes in the ice sheets that will likely commit us to the higher end of the 28-98cm range of sea-level rise predicted for the end of this century by the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nSenator Jacqui Lambie\u2019s description of past climate change on Q&A was not entirely correct.\n\nShe was right to say that Earth\u2019s climate has always changed. It always will - driven by a wide range of natural causes, and now dominated by the growing influence of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. And at different times it has been hotter and colder than today.\n\nBut was it 4\u2103 hotter 110,000 years ago, as Lambie said? No, not globally.\n\nThe Antarctic was about 4\u2103 hotter during last interglacial period (around 130,000-115,000 years ago) than it was in pre-industrial times \u2013 but the global average temperature then was closer to 1-2\u2103 warmer than pre-industrial times.\n\nOur climate today is at a similar global average temperature to the last interglacial period about 130,000-115,000 years ago. \u2013 Nerilie Abram\n\nThis is a sound FactCheck. It is presented in a clear and accessible manner. In drawing its conclusions it cites a range of peer-reviewed scientific literature in our top journals. It highlights the key distinction between local and global temperature, and our understanding of polar amplification.\n\nI would only add that the rate of warming over the last century is very unusual in the context of glacial and interglacial cycles. When the earth has moved out of ice ages in recent millennia it has taken, on average, 1,000 years to warm the planet by 1\u2103. The earth\u2019s temperature in recent decades has risen at around 1\u2103 per 100 years, or faster. So the recent rate of warming is very unusual in this context. NASA makes this point here.\n\nThe climate science community is very well aware of the record of past changes in the Earth\u2019s climate. Indeed, these changes are part of the evidence for why we expect the rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activity to produce large changes to the climate. \u2013 Ben Henley\n\nHave you ever seen a \u201cfact\u201d worth checking?
