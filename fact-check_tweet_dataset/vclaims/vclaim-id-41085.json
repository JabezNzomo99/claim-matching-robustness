Charlie Baker announced a four-month temporary ban on the sale of all vaping and e-cigarette products last week. The ban comes as more than a thousand vaping-related lung illnesses have been reported across the country, including at least 83 in Massachusetts.\n\nThere have been 1,080 cases of vaping-related lung illnesses reported in the U.S. and its territories, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Eighteen of those cases have proven fatal, according to federal health data released Thursday. It\u2019s still unclear what exactly is making people sick, though many patients used black market products containing THC (the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) oil that many people believe is being diluted with \u201cthickening agents.\u201d Illicit, counterfeit products from China are finding their ways into the legal marijuana market, according to officials and shopkeepers cited by the Washington Post.\n\nMassachusetts and several other states have instituted bans of some form on vapes and e-cigarette products in response to the burgeoning number of cases.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this public health emergency is to temporarily pause all sales of vaping products so that we can work with our medical experts to identify what is making people sick and how to better regulate these products to protect the health of our residents,\u201d said Baker in a statement.\n\nThe ban does not, however, extend to the use of vapes and e-cigarettes already in circulation, as the meme claims.\n\nEven if Massachusetts\u2019 ban did prohibit use of already purchased products (to be clear, it does not), it would be impossible to ban vaping from safe injection sites, as there aren\u2019t any in the state.\n\nSuch facilities \u2014 which have had successful results in Canada but are inconclusive to some experts \u2014 offer medical supervision to drug users in an effort to limit the number of overdose deaths from heroin and other opioids. Some Massachusetts doctors and lawmakers have advocated for them in recent months, but laws against using most of the drugs have prevented any from opening in the state.\n\nIn late August, Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone announced a plan to open a safe injection site next year, though it\u2019s still unclear if or when it will actually happen.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
