Andrew Cuomo\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as it ravages the state.\n\u2022 With mask use spiking at one New York hospital, Trump speculated that masks may be \u201cgoing out the back door,\u201d suggesting they are being stolen. He has provided no evidence, however, that theft is driving the increase. A bioresponse expert told us that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is \u201creasonable\u201d for hard-hit hospitals \u201cto see its mask use increase by an order of magnitude.\u201d\n\u2022 The president said that 4,000 ventilators delivered to New York from the federal stockpile are being kept in a \u201cwarehouse which happens to be located \u2013 which is interesting \u2014 in Edison, New Jersey,\u201d and so \u201cmaybe they didn\u2019t need them so badly.\u201d Cuomo said the ventilators are being stored in anticipation of peak demand in the coming weeks.\n\nTrump also repeated his misleading claim that \u201cNew York had a chance to get 16,000 ventilators a few years ago and they turned it down.\u201d We wrote about that in our March 26 story \u201cTrump\u2019s Misleading Ventilator Counter-Punch at Cuomo.\u201d\n\nNew York has borne the brunt of much of the early explosion of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Nearly 43% of the more than 156,000 confirmed cases nationwide were located in New York, as of the afternoon of March 30.\n\nDuring a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d phone interview on March 30, Trump was asked about polls showing high approval for Cuomo\u2019s handling of the pandemic, and speculation in an opinion piece in the New York Times about Cuomo\u2019s presidential potential.\n\n\u201cWell one of the reasons his numbers are high on handling it is because of the federal government, because we give him ships and we give him ventilators and we give him all of the things that we\u2019re giving him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOne of the reasons he\u2019s successful is because we\u2019ve helped make him successful.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Trump took several shots at the New York Democrat. The president claimed that despite Cuomo appealing to the federal government to provide more masks, ventilators and other equipment from federal emergency stockpiles, New York has not used the 4,000 ventilators the federal government has provided.\n\nAs for the shortage of masks, during a press conference the night before, Trump suggested a spike in the number of masks being used at one New York hospital seemed suspicious, and he implored reporters to look into whether masks may be \u201cgoing out the back door.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s claim about masks came after Edward Pesicka, president and CEO of Owens & Minor, said during the press conference that despite his company ramping up its production of masks, \u201cOne of the issues we\u2019re struggling with is the demand increase.\u201d\n\nPesicka then cited \u201can anecdotal example of one hospital in New York that traditionally uses roughly 10- to 20,000 masks a week are now using 2- to 300,000 masks a week. So you multiply that times \u2026 the entire U.S., let alone the same demand outside of the U.S. That\u2019s part of the issue we\u2019re running into, is even with a significant ramp-up in supply, you know, there\u2019s still that demand that is \u2014 that is much greater than that supply.\u201d\n\nTrump said those figures were discussed in a private meeting prior to the press conference.\n\nTrump, March 29: That statement was made that they\u2019ve been delivering for years, 10- to 20,000 masks. Okay, it\u2019s a New York hospital. Very \u2014 it\u2019s packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20, to 300,000? 10- to 20,000 masks to 300,000? Even though this is different, something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So, somebody should probably look into that, because I just don\u2019t see, from a practical standpoint, how that\u2019s possible to go from that to that. And we have that happening in numerous places \u2014 not to that extent; that was the highest number I\u2019ve heard. That\u2019s the highest number you\u2019ve seen, I would imagine, right? But this man makes them and delivers them to a lot of hospitals. He knows the system better than anybody. And I think you were more surprised than I was when you saw that number. So thank you very much. I hope I didn\u2019t get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble. So they have to look at that in New York.\n\nTo be clear, in his public statement Pesicka did not speculate that the high demand for masks from the New York hospital in recent weeks was due to theft.\n\nLater in the press conference, Trump doubled down on the speculation, saying that with such a large increase in demand for masks at one hospital, \u201cI think people should check that because there\u2019s something going on, whether \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hoarding; I think it\u2019s maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out. Check it out.\u201d\n\nAfter the press conference, leading Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden dismissed Trump\u2019s speculation as \u201cridiculous and completely false.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s conspiracy-mongering from our President is among the most reckless and ignorant moves he has made during this crisis, and there have been many,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cLives hang in the balance.\u201d\n\nAlso after the press conference, the Trump campaign pointed to news reports from March 6 in which Cuomo asked the state police to investigate reports from health care professionals that \u201cthere have been thefts of medical equipment and masks from hospitals, believe it or not. Not just people taking a couple or three, I mean just actual thefts of those products.\u201d\n\nA CNBC story about Cuomo\u2019s comments noted that the governor didn\u2019t indicate how much supplies or equipment was missing.\n\nThe Trump campaign also pointed to comments from an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, who, according to Modern Healthcare, \u201csaid her hospital has had thefts of respirator masks and other essential protective equipment in lobbies and other high-traffic areas.\u201d\n\nBut there is no indication of the scale of these thefts, and no evidence that they are driving the spiking demand for masks and other protective equipment at hospitals dealing with a steep increase in patients infected with COVID-19.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in early March it had only about 1% of the masks that would be needed in a severe pandemic. An HHS spokesperson told CNBC that the U.S. had 42 million N95 and surgical masks in the federal stockpile, and that the U.S. would need about 3.5 billion to handle a severe pandemic.\n\nKenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, released a statement in response to Trump\u2019s comments that Americans \u201cdeserve better than their President suggesting that PPE is \u2018going out the back door\u2019 of New York hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew York\u2019s healthcare workers are treating exploding numbers of COVID-19 patients around the clock \u2013 willingly and without complaint. My daughter, an ICU nurse at a New York City hospital, is one of them,\u201d Raske said. \u201cThe only thing they ask for in return is adequate amounts of personal protective equipment. PPE is the single thing that separates them from being COVID-19 patients themselves.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to a spokesman at Owens & Minor to find out what hospital Pesicka was referring to, but we did not get a response. We also did not get a response from NYC Health + Hospitals, which runs the city\u2019s public hospitals, about whether any of its hospitals were using as many masks as Pesicka cited.\n\nDr. George L. Anesi, director of the Medical Critical Care Bioresponse Team at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, where he has been leading the efforts to prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic, told us in an email that while he couldn\u2019t comment on the appropriate use of masks at any particular hospital, \u201cduring the COVID-19 pandemic, it is reasonable for any hospital in a high-risk region, of which there are now many in the US, to see its mask use increase by an order of magnitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncreased demand for and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks, has occurred for a number of reasons,\u201d said Anesi. \u201cFirst, even before novel coronavirus arrived, the US was in the midst of an intense respiratory viral season,\u201d from various non-novel coronavirus strains and other viruses. \u201cSecond, arrival of the novel coronavirus prompted the need for masks for the care of both patients with confirmed COVID-19 and, importantly, patients who might have COVID-19 but were awaiting evaluation or testing. With the exponential spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, essentially any patient with respiratory complaints has the potential to be infected, and requires the use of masks to protect staff, family members, and other patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any situation of increased demand or inadequate supply, there is always going to be some diversion, including from hospitals and from the public purchasing equipment most needed by frontline healthcare workers,\u201d Anesi said. \u201cAppropriate use by healthcare workers in this rapidly expanding pandemic is the dominant force currently.\u201d\n\nIn his public comments, Trump also questioned why thousands of ventilators sent by the federal government to New York were being held in storage, even as Cuomo pleads for more.\n\nAt a press conference on March 29, Trump said that with thousands of ventilators sitting in storage in New York, \u201cmaybe they didn\u2019t need them so badly.\u201d\n\nTrump echoed that point in his \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview the next morning.\n\nCuomo has acknowledged that there are thousands of ventilators being held in storage, but he said that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t needed, or that New York doesn\u2019t need more. Cuomo said they are being stockpiled ahead of anticipated demand in a couple weeks.\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Cuomo said the president\u2019s comments indicate Trump doesn\u2019t understand \u201chow to run a government, how to plan an operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis virus has been ahead of us from day one,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing catch-up from day one. Still two, three, four weeks away depending on whose projection model you use. Prepare for the apex. Have the materials for the apex. That\u2019s when the system is going to collapse. They sent 4,000 ventilators. I\u2019m not using them today because I don\u2019t need them today. I need to assemble them in a stockpile. A stockpile, by definition, is to be used at the high point.\u201d\n\nCuomo has said that based on projections from medical experts, New York is expected to need as many as 30,000 ventilators \u201cat that high point of need.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the numerical projections say,\u201d Cuomo said on March 28. \u201cSo we\u2019re planning for that quote, unquote worst case scenario which the models predict. Maybe we never get there, maybe we flatten the curve and we slow the infection rate so we never get to that point and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do and we\u2019re working on that day and night. But, if we can\u2019t flatten the curve, you can\u2019t slow the infection rate, you hit that apex, make sure you\u2019re ready for the apex and that\u2019s where the 30,000 ventilators come in.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes\u201d on March 27, Cuomo said the data comes from a variety of sources, including the state health department.\n\n\u201cSo what I do is I just study the numbers and the science and the data and I follow the data,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe have McKinsey & Company [a global management consulting firm], we have and Weill-Cornell medical center [the biomedical research unit and medical school of Cornell University], I talked to the World Health Organization, look at the models of China, look at the models of South Korea, look at the models of Italy and look at the models of the numbers in my state.\u201d\n\nIn his March 30 interview on \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Cuomo said, \u201cThe tsunami is coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know it is,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to gather supplies, do the preparations because it\u2019s too late the day before. If you have not done the work before the storm hits, it\u2019s too late to do it once the storm hits. And the storm is coming. Stop the politics. Listen to the scientists and the pros and plan because otherwise \u2026 people will die who don\u2019t need to die. That\u2019s the bottom line. \u2026 The storm hits in two weeks, three weeks, this is what I\u2019m going to need. If you don\u2019t want to see a total collapse. And let\u2019s focus on getting that.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
