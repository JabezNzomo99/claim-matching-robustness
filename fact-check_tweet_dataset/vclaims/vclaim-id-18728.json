In the video, a group of people is seen sloganeering in support of BJP and waving the party flag. Some burqa-clad women can also be seen in the video. A text on the video says this is not India but Pakistan (Balochistan).\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video was shot during the general election 2019 in Anantnag, Jammu & Kashmir.\n\nAmong others, a verified user Atul Kushwaha\u2019 also tweeted this misleading video on August 11. The tweet has been liked by more than 1,000 users and retweeted more than 450 times.\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook as well.\n\nIn the video, it can be heard that people are raising slogans in support of Sofi Sahaab\u2019. With the help of related keywords, AFWA found a YouTube video of Punjab Kesari TV in which the similar procession can be seen. In this video, it can also be noticed that the crowd is raising slogans similar to ones heard in the viral video.\n\nThe title of this video says BJP candidate from Anantnag Sofi Yousuf filled (filed) his nomination. Upon probing further, we found that this video was shot during the Lok Sabha election 2019 when BJP candidate from Anantnag, Sofi Yousuf, filed his nomination.\n\nYousuf had himself tweeted a video of the same procession on March 30, 2019.\n\nHe had lost to Hasnain Masoodi of National Conference in the elections.\n\nThis misleading post also went viral during the general elections 2019. At that time, BBC had debunked this fake news.", "lang": "en"}
