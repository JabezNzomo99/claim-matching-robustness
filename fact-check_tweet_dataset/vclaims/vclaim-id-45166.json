The man, purportedly Gates, goes through a slideshow on the VMAT2 gene and a \u201cFunVax\u201d vaccine to suppress it in the video. He concludes by saying the project has shown \u201cgreat promise.\u201d\n\nThe VMAT2 gene, which stands for vesicular monoamine transporter 2, was dubbed the \u201cGod Gene\u201d in Dr. Dean Hamer\u2019s 2004 book \u201cThe God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into Our Genes.\u201d That book discussed how a \u201cvariation in the VMAT2 gene plays a role in one\u2019s openness to spiritual experiences,\u201d according to an article published in the CBE Life Science Education journal.\n\nHowever, the man giving the presentation in the video is not Gates, and the video appears to be a hoax that has circulated online for years.

In that version, viewers can clearly see that the man doesn\u2019t resemble Gates. A spokesperson for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also confirmed to Reuters that it is not him.\n\nLead Stories, a fact-checking website, reported that the video appeared to be a promotion for a \u201cfaux documentary.\u201d The creator had a Kickstarter campaign seeking funds for investigating the \u201ctruth behind the Vaccine Against Religious Fundamentalism\u201d and trailer for the alleged vaccine, per Lead Stories.\n\nThe video appears on numerous fringe websites, often under tags such as \u201cchem trails,\u201d \u201ceugenics\u201d and \u201cPentagon bioweapon to destroy religion,\u201d according to Vice.", "lang": "en"}
