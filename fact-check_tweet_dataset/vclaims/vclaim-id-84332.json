Here are a few debunked by AFP.\n\nThis photo was shared in Canada, in Australia, in France, in Poland and Georgia: the young Swedish activist posing with George Soros, a Jewish American billionaire of Hungarian origin, and a regular target for conspiracy theories in Europe and the United States.\n\nThe photo actually came from a French satirical website, secretnews.fr, where it was altered. The original photo showed Thunberg posing with former US vice-president Al Gore, and was published in December 2018.\n\nHere is our article.\n\nA collage featuring the Soros photo mentioned above also shows a photo of a young girl held by a man in front of an Islamic State group flag, with the claim that the girl is Thunberg.\n\nThe photo is actually a screenshot of a video of a Koran recitation contest organized by the Islamic State organization in Aleppo, Syria, in 2013. There is no evidence that the girl in the photo is Thunberg.\n\nAFP debunked this photo in March 2019 when it was shared with the false claim that the girl was being sold as a child bride.\n\nThe third photo of the collage, featuring Thunberg wearing a t-shirt supportive of the anti-fascist group Antifa, is real. Thunberg shared the image on Twitter in July 2019. Following outrage over the perception of the group as violent, she deleted the photo and tweeted that she does not condone violence, while remaining staunchly against facism.\n\nHundreds of plastic bags and bottles strewn across a public park lawn after a climate march organized for Thunberg\u2019s visit in New York City?\n\nThat\u2019s what many online publications shared thousands of times claimed to show, providing a photo as proof. However, the photo shows London\u2019s Hyde Park in April 2019, following a 4-20 protest for the legalization of cannabis.\n\nIn Brazil, a photo allegedly showing Thunberg enjoying a feast inside of a train while young children in rags look on enviously from the outside, was also widely shared.\n\nThis photo is fabricated. The young Swede published the original photo in January on her Twitter account with the caption \u201cLunch in Denmark.\u201d Outside, rows of trees visible through the train window, not hungry children.\n\nHere is an article in Portuguese from our AFP Checamos colleagues.\n\nA false magazine cover shows Thunberg\u2019s face above the words \u201cAnnual List of Highest Paid Activists,\u201d in the style of Forbes Magazine\u2019s 100 richest people on Earth list.\n\nHowever, the magazine cover originated on a parody website, and a spokesperson for Thunberg told AFP that she does not receive payment for her appearances or media engagements.", "lang": "en"}
