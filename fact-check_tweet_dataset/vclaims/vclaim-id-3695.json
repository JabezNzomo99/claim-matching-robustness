Here we verify key claims made by members of parliament as they reflected on newly-elected President Cyril Ramphosa's maiden address.\n\n\n\n The Democratic Alliance\u2019s (DA) George Michalakis pointed out that while the Western Cape province has high levels of violence, it has the lowest unemployment rate in the country.\n\n\"This is a strange paradox. Lower unemployment should lead to lower crime stats,\u201d he said.\n\nreleased by Statistics South Africa last week shows that Michalakis is right about the unemployment rate. In the last quarter of 2017, it had both the lowest narrow and lowest broad unemployment rate (the second rate includes\n\npeople who had given up looking for a job).\n\nIn response to the DA\u2019s boast about the Western Cape province\u2019s low unemployment rate, the ANC\u2019s Richard Dyantyi that the province\u2019s economic performance \u201cexcludes the vulnerable people of the Western Cape\u201d, with the bulk of unemployed people being youth. \n\n\n\n Note: Dyantyi also claimed the Western Cape hadn\u2019t employed young people as part of the national department\u2019s , but Africa Check was unable to confirm this with departmental spokesman Sputnik Ratau or Asief Alli, the programme manager for the \n\n\n\n In the last three months of 2017, the province had an estimated who were actively looking for a job, according to Stats SA most recent employment survey. Of those, the bulk (378,000 people, or 62.7%) were youth between the ages of 15 and 34, as Dyantyi had said. \n\n\n\n But the picture was similar at the national level, with youth making up 63.9% of the country\u2019s\n\nThese ratios were much the same for the broad unemployment rate, which includes people \u201cwe term \u2018discouraged work seekers\u2019 \u2013 those who have not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey\u201d, Lauren Graham told Africa Check. She is deputy director at the University of Johannesburg\u2019s \n\n\n\n \u201cThey may not have looked for work for a range of reasons, including not having the funds to look for work and having given up looking for work over that time.\u201d \n\n\n\n Stats SA data for broad unemployment in the Western Cape indicated that, of the , 466,000 were youth between the ages of 15-34. At the national level, were in that age group during October to December 2017. \n\n\n\n There are a number of factors that drive South Africa\u2019s high youth unemployment rate, said Graham said, including slow economic growth. \n\n\n\n \u201c[Y]outh tend to be at the back of the labour market queue because they are coming in with very little experience, and many of them coming in with very little training. We also know that when jobs are shed, young people are the first to lose jobs and they are the last to recover, so that drives the higher rates of unemployment for young people.\u201d - Ina Skosana \n\n\n\n\n\n, drew attention to the slice of national revenue that local government receives from treasury.\n\n\u201cWe have raised an ongoing concern that\u2026 local government receives an average of 9% from the national fiscus,\u201d he said.\n\nTau\u2019s number is supported by the latest data from national treasury.\n\nshows that local government received 8.9% of nationally-raised revenue in 2016/17. In comparison, provinces received 43.1%.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that municipalities are\n\nmost of their own administrative costs. According to treasury, \u201cthe constitution gives local government substantial revenue-raising powers\u201d such as property rates and charges for the provision of basic services. These avenues for revenue collection are not available to provinces.\n\nBut the ability to gather revenue differs from municipality to municipality, according to local government expert\n\n\u201cThe large metros will generally raise the great bulk of their own resources. As you get to smaller and smaller municipalities, their ability to do so decreases,\u201d Siddle explained.\n\n\u201cSome municipalities have almost non-existent revenue bases, for example places out in the sticks where you have property values of no great significance and very small populations. There is nothing from which they can derive adequate revenue from.\u201d\n\nMP Jooste paid particular attention to the toll on women who prioritise their children\u2019s nutrition over their own. \n\n\n\n \u201cWomen are literally sacrificing their bodies by eating the leftovers of the little they have so that their children can eat better,\u201d she stressed. \u201c And the sad part about this is that this strategy is not even working.\u201d \n\n\n\n She continued that the \u201cbiggest cause of deaths amongst women is non-communicable diseases\u201d. , often referred to as \u201clifestyle diseases\u201d, are the result of factors such as genetics, the environment and our behaviour. These include chronic condition such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. \n\n\n\n Jooste told Africa Check that she sourced this claim from the most recent mortality and causes of death report . The report, released by Stats SA last year for 2015, lists diabetes as the leading cause of death among women, accounting for 7.1% of all female deaths \n\n\n\n , deaths certificates do not provide an accurate reflection of South Africa\u2019s AIDS-related deaths, \n\n\n\n , which is the latest available, researchers from South Africa\u2019s Medical Research Council found that deaths due to AIDS-related causes were often misclassified or undercounted. \n\n\n\n - Ina Skosana Researchers adjusted the data for deficiencies and found that Aids-related causes were the leading cause of death among women, accounting for 30.2% of all deaths in 2012. \n\n\n\n\n\nEFF member Floyd Shivambu bemoaned a country \u201cwith exposure of state-owned companies that have got guarantees of government\u201d. \n\n\n\n \u201cThe debt that is guaranteed by the state in Eskom is R350 billion. In SANRAL, it\u2019s R38.9 billion. In South African Airways, it\u2019s R19.1 billion. In Denel, it\u2019s R1.8 billion. In the Road Accident Fund, it\u2019s R8.5 billion,\u201d he listed. \u201cAnd these are the futures that you\u2019re inheriting.\u201d\n\nThis means that Tsapane Kgwedi Mampuru, who represents the ANC in the National Council of Provinces, waswhen later in the debate she said: \u201cI must indicate upfront that Limpopo province has the lowest unemployment rate in the country at 20.8%.\u201d (Note: That was Limpopo's narrow unemployment rate in the second quarter of 2017, but also then the Western Cape's rate was slightly lower at 20.7%.) - Ina Skosana", "lang": "en"}
