The posts share the following words:\n\n\"There will be a twin year (2020) from which will arise a queen (corona) who will come from the east (China) and who will spread a plague (virus) in the darkness of night, on a country with 7 hills (Italy) and will transform the twilight of men into dust (death), to destroy and ruin the world. It will be the end of the world economy as you know it.\n\nWe could find no passages in Nostradamus\u2019 collective works that resemble these words. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Nostradamus is best known for \"Les Proph\u00e9ties,\" a collection of poetic quatrains that are united in sets of verses, or \"centuries,\" that was first published in 1555. This purported prediction does not follow the pattern of his typical vague, four-line poems, and we couldn\u2019t find anything resembling it in Les Proph\u00e9ties, or in various versions of his compiled works. Recent social media posts also appear to be the first and only occurrences of this prophecy online, and none provide additional details or evidence as to where it was found, which typically indicates it was fabricated. There is no evidence Nostradamus wrote this, it doesn\u2019t follow the quatrain format of his predictions and the words cannot be found in his works.", "lang": "en"}
