Several international media have also reported on the rising number of medical frontliners dying in Italy, hitting 41 as of March 26, based on the latest report.\n\nBut there have been no reports reflecting the netizen\u2019s claim that the country has run out of doctors. There are over 240,000 practicing medical doctors in Italy, according to a 2019 European Union report on physician statistics.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s untrue post has widely made the rounds on the web, receiving over 4,000 reactions, 1,300 comments and 36,000 shares on FB.", "lang": "en"}
