The claim is false; as of April 2020, health experts have said there is no evidence that papaya salad can prevent people from catching the virus; the World Health Organization (WHO) maintains that wearing masks, social distancing and washing hands regularly are the most effective methods of preventing infection.\n\nThe video was published on Facebook here on April 11, 2020. It has been viewed more than 331,000 times and shared more than 8,700 times.\n\nThe one-minute 37-second video shows Dr. Pornthep Siriwanarangsan, the former director-general of Thailand\u2019s Department of Disease Control, saying that eating papaya salad can protect people from COVID-19 infection.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nAt the video\u2019s one-minute 15-second mark, Siriwanarangsan can be heard saying: \"In papaya salad there is garlic and chilli, which are mucolytics that will help protect you from COVID-19.\"\n\nThe post's caption reads: \u201cDo you want to eat papaya salad?
