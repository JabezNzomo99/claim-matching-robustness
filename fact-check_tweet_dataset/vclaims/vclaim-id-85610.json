Trump made this claim while explaining why he had not yet made a statement about the four U.S. Special Forces members who died on Oct. 4 in Niger during a deadly ambush by dozens of Islamist extremists.\n\nTrump said that letters were drafted over the weekend for the families and would be \u201cgoing out either today or tomorrow.\u201d He also said he planned to make phone calls, unlike Obama. But when questioned about this, he then quickly backtracked: \u201cPresident Obama, I think, probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes he didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what I was told. All I can do is ask my generals.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is plenty of evidence that Obama met with families of fallen service members. In 2011, he flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware when 30 troops \u2014 including 22 Navy SEALs \u2014 died after their helicopter was hit by a rocket in Afghanistan. He met with the families there as the remains were brought home.\n\nOnly a month earlier, Leon Panetta had been named defense secretary. He was there with Obama on the tarmac in Dover. In an interview with The Fact Checker, Panetta recalled that Obama also \u201cmade calls to some of the families\u201d involved in the helicopter crash. He said he was also told by staff of other occasions when Obama contacted families.\n\nStill, in early 2011, the family of one fallen soldier, Sgt. Sean Collins, told Fox News they had requested a call from Obama and were told his schedule was too packed for a conversation. (Note: At that point, about 1,000 troops had been killed in Iraq or Afghanistan under Obama\u2019s watch. So far in 2017, 25 troops have been killed in those countries.)\n\nGenerally, former Obama aides said, the president wrote letters or made base visits in which he met with families. \u201cI remember he did on occasion make calls and met Gold Star families at the White House and on his base visits,\u201d said Benjamin Rhodes, a national security aide to Obama.\n\nSharon Belkofer, a Gold Star mother whose son died in 2010 in Afghanistan, told the Democratic National Convention in 2016 that she met Obama at Fort Drum, where \u201cI cried all over his suit.\u201d She met him again a year later and was inspired to run for school board at age 73. After she won, \u201cthe president even sent me a handwritten note of congratulations,\u201d she said.\n\nPanetta faulted Trump for appearing to try to explain away poor staff work. As a former White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton, Panetta said: \u201cI suspect some staff members did not get letters [about Niger] to the president as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nGiven that Trump more or less took back his claim in real time, we will not rate this statement. But Trump, as is his style, was too quick to charge that Obama had not made phone calls. Perhaps he was influenced by the Fox News report in 2011, or perhaps he received some bum information. But generally one would not expect a president or a White House to announce that such a painful and difficult call had been made.", "lang": "en"}
