Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral claim is false.\n\nThe post shared on Facebook claims that any type of poison (from snake poison to celphos poison) can be cured on call immediately. The contact numbers were also mentioned on the viral post: 9893905661, 9754304435, 9425460326, 9753367868 and 9826430189. The archived version of the post can be read here.\n\nVishvas News called up the numbers given in the post. One of the numbers which got connected was received by someone who said that he cures poison by chanting a mantra on the phone. When we inquired further he disconnected the call and switched off his phone.\n\nWe also searched online whether all types\u2019 of poisons can be cured by chanting a mantra. The researches and detailed fact check can be read here.\n\nWe further investigated by contacting National Poison Informatics Centers of AIIMS. Dr Swati Sharma of AIIMS stated that: \u201cThere is a proper treatment for poison. Doctors contact the people for treatments and they provide suggestions. The treatments need to be followed properly. One cannot treat any deadly poison just by saying something to the patient on call.\u201c\n\nThe post has been shared on Facebook by a user named Dipu Pagare Dipu Pagare. We scanned the social profile of the user and found that the user is based out of Khandwa.\n\nConclusion: Post claiming treatment of all deadly poisons on call is fake. The post was debunked in June 2019 and has resurfaced now.", "lang": "en"}
