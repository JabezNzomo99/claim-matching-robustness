It is being suggested that apart from Mohammed Pasha, a 26-year-old lorry driver, the other three accused in the Hyderabad rape case were also from the Muslim community.\n\nTwitter handle @realhistoripix, which on several occasions has been found spreading misinformation, posted the graphic saying, \u201c\u0935\u0948\u091f\u0928\u0930\u0940 \u0921\u0949\u0915\u094d\u091f\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0932\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0935 \u0939\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0938\u0932\u0940 \u0928\u093e\u092e\u0964 1. \u092e\u094b\u0939\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0926 \u092a\u093e\u0936\u093e 2. \u092e\u094b\u0939\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0926 \u0907\u0915\u092c\u093e\u0932 3. \u092e\u094b\u0939\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0926 \u0930\u0939\u0940\u092e 4. \u092e\u094b\u0939\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0926 \u0905\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e (Real names of the Hyderabad veterinarian\u2019s rapist. 1. Mohammed Pasha 2. Mohammed Iqbal 3.Mohammed Rahim 4.Mohammed Akram)\u201d. It may be noted that the claim is attributed to another Twitter handle @pokershash which has also been found spreading misinformation on several occasions. However, the handle has denied tweeting the information.\n\nMany other people on Facebook and Twitter have posted the same claim.\n\nIn the recent development in the case, all the four accused of the murder and rape were killed in an encounter with the Telangana police in the wee hours of December 6, 2019.\n\nThe claim that all the accused in the Hyderabad rape case hailed from the Muslim community is patently false. In a press note issued by the police, the accused were identified as follows:\n\nYou can see the names listed in a screenshot of a press note below.\n\nThe same names were reiterated by the police in a press conference after the incident.\n\nMoreover, The Quint spoke with the families of all the four accused. The article identifies the family members of the accused as follows:\n\nSuffice to say, the claim that all the accused in the gruesome rape and murder of the Hyderabad veterinarian did not hail from the same community. Cyberabad police also refuted the claim by saying, \u201cIt is false information. All the accused not belongs to one religion. One is Muslim and remaining 3 are Hindus. It is a heinous crime and we are working hard to ensure capital punishment to all the accused. Please don\u2019t give religious colour to the crime.\u201d\n\nAlt News had earlier fact-checked a similar claim where it was said that three out of the four accused in Hyderbad gang-rape case were minors. The claim was promoted by self-proclaimed saint Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati.", "lang": "en"}
