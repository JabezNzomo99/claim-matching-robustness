They alleged that women participating in the sit-in protest are being paid to demonstrate against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens. A man in the video further claimed that the protest was \u201csponsored\u201d by the Congress party. Malviya reiterated the claim in his tweet.\n\nTimes Now broadcast the video tweeted by Malviya with the disclaimer that it \u201cdoes not vouch for the authenticity of the video\u201d. In its broadcast, Times Now\u2019s Megha Prasad said, \u201cIt looks like a sting operation, this particular video. It\u2019s of course been shot with a hidden camera and it tries to show that people who are there at Shaheen Bagh are perhaps being paid for doing this sit-in dharna but again I am saying it is not for us to either corroborate or confirm any of this. We do not even know from where the BJP has got this video. Is it their own video, is it their own sting, have they sourced it from anyone?\u201d.\n\nPrasad continued, \u201cAmit Malviya has not given the credit to anybody. So one is just assuming at this stage, perhaps, they have been able to manage something like this.\u201d\n\nPrimetime debates on India Today and Republic TV also focused on Malviya\u2019s video. Republic TV asked \u201cIs Shaheen Bagh a paid protest?\u201d and ran the hashtag #ProtestOnHire.\n\nMy Nation, a portal that has links to the BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrashekar, published a report on the unverified video and asserted, \u201cNow, you can also add that fact that they are being bribed to take part in the protests.\u201d\n\nOpIndia, another Right-wing propaganda website, picked up the story too and said: \u201cEven though OpIndia could not verify the authenticity of the video, it certainly raises doubts about the credibility of the organized Shaheen Bagh protests.\u201d\n\nSeveral other prominent Right-wing handles like BJP Gujarat MLA Harsh Sanghvi, BJP Mahila Morcha\u2019s Priti Gandhi, former Shiv Sena member Ramesh Solanki, BJP Delhi IT cell head Punit Agarwal, and filmmaker Ashoke Pandit amplified the video with identical claims.\n\nWe watched the video frame-by-frame. In one frame, a mobile number printed on one of the posters on the wall is visible. The number is \u201c9312484044\u201d.\n\nA Google search for this number revealed that it belongs to a shop named \u201cKusmi Telecom Center.\u201d The image of the shop on Google Maps corroborates with details in the video: The wall is the same colour. The wall in the video also looks like it\u2019s in a mobile shop, based on the data plan posters seen in the background.\n\n\u2018The video was shot at my shop, claims are unreliable\u2019\n\nThe \u201cexpos\u00e9\u201d on the citizenship law protests was, in fact, shot eight kilometres away from Shaheen Bagh in South Delhi\u2019s Pul Prahladpur. The area falls under the Tughlakabad constituency. The video was made at shop number 134, called Kusmi Telecom, located at F-block in Mittal colony \u2014 just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the Tughlakabad metro station.\n\nThe Tughlakabad urban area sits on the hillocks of South Delhi, so its streets slope randomly. The main commercial street in Mittal Colony\u2019s F-block ends at an uphill intersection. Kusmi Telecom is located at this junction.\n\nAshwani Kumar, 38, runs the shop with his sectagenarian father. He sells data plans, print-outs, chips, eggs and cigarettes. The shop, with big red advertisements for Airtel and Vodafone, does not stretch beyond 8-10 square feet. Its walls are painted teal, and a wall-clock featuring BJP leaders, prominently Narendra Modi, faces the customer.\n\nKumar and his father vehemently denied that the video was shot in their shop \u2014 until four days later when he admitted it had been. While he denied shooting it himself, too many things don\u2019t add up.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, the leaders do not care much about the elders and the widows here, be it MLA or MP,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cAll of them come once every five years, asking for votes. I take people to their leaders and get their work done. I work for the people.\u201d\n\nAshwani Kumar likes to call himself a \u201ckaryakarta\u201d, or a worker. Given the BJP paraphernalia in his shop, can he be described as a \u201cBJP worker\u201d? \u201cOnly \u2018worker\u2019 will do,\u201d he grinned, \u201calthough I\u2019ve belonged to the BJP since the beginning.\u201d\n\nSeveral stacks of documents lay on the shelves of his shop \u2014 paperwork of people that Kumar helps. He took them out and put them on the table. \u201cLook, this person did not get their pension,\u201d he pointed to a piece of paper. Kumar said both the AAP MLA and BJP MP are approachable representatives. When you go to them with problems, as Kumar does, \u201cthey treat you well and listen to you\u201d.\n\nDiscussing the CAA and the NRC, both father and son support it. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s so much protest about it,\u201d said the father. The son added: \u201cIf the government had made a law, it must be right. Those people are educated. They must be thinking about the country.\u201d\n\nAnd what about the people who are protesting against the law? \u201cThere are all kinds of people. There was firing at Jamia today, for instance,\u201d Kumar said, his implication being it was a protester who fired \u2014 which is untrue. \u201cThe Muslims living here [Mittal Colony] are also fine. They are peace-loving.\u201d\n\nHis father interjected: \u201cThere are 125 crore people, who knows what kind of people are getting into this country?\u201d\n\nWhen I brought up the \u201cexpos\u00e9\u201d on Shaheen Bagh \u2014 that the protest is \u201csponsored\u201d and women were being paid to protest \u2014 Kumar said, \u201cIt is wrong to say such things about people. It is all hearsay, and people just like to spread it further. It can also be a lie.\u201d\n\nFrom the first 20 minutes of conversation, certain things are clear.\n\nFirst, the \u201cexpos\u00e9\u201d spread by the BJP was shot at this shop. The visuals in the video gel perfectly with the interiors: the walls, the eggs, the numbers, etc.\n\nSecond, there were three voices in that video: the accuser, visible on camera, and two others, who couldn\u2019t be seen. To my mind, one of the voices sounds exactly like Kumar\u2019s father \u2014 it\u2019s distinctly hoarse and crusty. In fact, it sounds like it\u2019s Kumar\u2019s father who says \u201csab Congress ka khel hai\u201d in the video. This was later quoted in Amit Malviya\u2019s tweet and repeated on Times Now.\n\nSimilarly, Kumar\u2019s voice, with its accent and flair, fits with the voice in the video that emanates from directly behind the camera.\n\nThird, the video is clearly shot on a phone, not a sting camera. Its original frame (see here) is a typical phone-sized frame that was shrunk when Malviya shared it online.\n\nAdding these up, could it be that Ashwani Kumar shot the video himself?\n\nWhen asked if the video was shot in his shop, Kumar got antsy and denied it vehemently. \u201cTwo people can go to any shop, talk nonsense, shoot a video and make it viral. It is not a difficult thing to do.\u201d\n\nSo was that video shot at your shop? \u201cNo,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe conversation might have looped from election issues to Shaheen Bagh, but Kumar was now fully aware that we\u2019re investigating the BJP video. He turned defensive, claiming he has no affiliation to any political party. He began cursing and grabbed my notebook, striking off the bit where I had written \u201cBJP karyakarta\u201d under his name. He then ripped out the pages with my notes.\n\nAs I smoked a cigarette that I\u2019d bought from his own store, Kumar even shot a video of me(Newslaundry reporter), saying, \u201cLook, this man is smoking at my shop without my permission.\u201d\n\nHe then said: \u201cWherever that video might have been shot, you should know one thing. That boy in it did not know anything. He was a kid. He couldn\u2019t tell his elbow from his ass. And by the way, I have nothing to do with the BJP, the AAP or the Congress.\u201d The \u201cboy\u201d refers to the person in the \u201csting\u201d video who says Shaheen Bagh\u2019s women are being paid to protest.\n\nTill the last minute of our meeting, Kumar remained incensed and refused to concede that the video was shot at his shop. Finally, four days later, he told me over the phone: \u201cThe video was indeed shot at my shop,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it was another person who shot it covertly from outside. And what was said in it is unreliable.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to believe Ashwani\u2019s caveat \u2014 that the video was shot from outside the shop by an outsider. In the video, the accuser, who is standing outside and across the desk, looks inside while addressing the comments of the person behind the camera.\n\nAdditionally, at 1:24 in the video, the camera zooms out and it becomes clear that the person shooting the video is inside the shop. A person standing outside would have to stretch his hands all the way to the inside to shoot that frame. Such gymnastics would hardly go unnoticed, and would be far from being \u201ccovert\u201d, which Kumar claimed it was. When I posed this to him, he said his father might not have noticed it because he is an \u201celder\u201d.\n\n\u2018There is no proof, it is common sense\u2019\n\nAbout 50 metres away from Ashwani Kumar\u2019s shop, the neighbourhood was decorated with BJP flags. A particularly large party flag was hoisted on the terrace of one of the houses.\n\nThis is the home of Bhanwar Singh Rana, a local BJP worker in Pul Prahladpur. A stout man with a ready smile, Rana believes that women in Shaheen Bagh are being paid to protest. He cannot prove it, he claimed, but it is \u201ccommon sense\u201d. \u201cIf the protest is honest, why are they making women sit on the road?\u201d\n\nNearing the end of an hour-long conversation on politics, the BJP, news and newsmakers, Rana said he likes Republic Bharat.\n\nIsn\u2019t that the channel that did the Shaheen Bagh sting on women, I asked him, deliberately and incorrectly. He smiled, turned to an acolyte seated beside him, and asked mischievously: \u201cDo you know who did that sting?\u201d\n\nRana answered the question himself: \u201cHe is from our street only. There is a shop in our neighbourhood. One boy stood there and talked, and someone made a video of him.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Rana to introduce this shop owner to me(Newslaundry reporter), he said he couldn\u2019t. \u201cThat person has told me not to reveal his identity. I don\u2019t know who the boy is, but I know the shopwalla. He\u2019s close to me.\u201d\n\nRana gave me Kumar\u2019s answer when I probed further. \u201cA person who was standing outside the shop made the video, not the shop owner,\u201d he claimed. \u201cYou keep that video with yourself. You come to me after February 8, after the elections, and I\u2019ll introduce you to the shop owner,\u201d he grinned.\n\nThis AltNews-Newslaundry investigation would have been unnecessary if the news outlets that carried this \u201csting\u201d as news \u2014 and even conducted primetime debates on it \u2014 had done their own investigation in the matter.\n\nHere\u2019s basically what happened: three people in a corner of Delhi made unproven claims about a protest eight kilometres away, one of them filmed it, the governing party spread it on social media, and channels like Times Now, Republic and India Today debated it on national television. These tall claims \u2014 from which the shopkeeper distanced himself, and which the BJP couldn\u2019t back with evidence \u2014 might have attracted eyeballs and generated advertising revenue, but they also lent credence to baseless, unverified claims.\n\nThese became a part of an online misinformation campaign to portray the women at Shaheen Bagh as paid protesters. A morphed image and an old video were used for this. These representations came handy in the political domain, like when Home Minister Amit Shah remarked that Delhi voters should \u201cpress the voting button so hard that the current is felt in Shaheen Bagh\u201d, or when a BJP minister made a crowd chant\u201cdesh ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro saalon ko\u201d, effectively endangering the lives of adults and children at the Shaheen Bagh protest.\n\nWe reached out to Amit Malviya for his comments. This story will be updated if and when he responds.\n\n[Alt News and Newslaundry are independent platforms that focus on misinformation and propaganda in the mainstream media.
