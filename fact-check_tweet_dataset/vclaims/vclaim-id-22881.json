But are up to 80% of farmers in the country smallholders?\n\nWe asked Boga for his sources and he sent us the\n\nof his ministry\u2019s 10-year plan for 2019 to 2029.\n\nTitled the Agriculture Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy, the plan estimates there are 4.5 million small-scale farmers, including \u201c3.5 million crop farmers, 600,000 pastoralists and 130,000 fisherfolk\u201d.\n\nA farmer is defined as \u201ca person who owns, works on, or operates an agricultural enterprise that cultivates land or crops, or raises animals including livestock and fish\u201d.\n\n\n\n \n\n Who is a \u2018smallholder\u2019 farmer?\n\n\n\n It depends on who you ask. Kenya\u2019s agriculture ministry smallholder farmers as those working land between 0.5 and 5 hectares. Medium-scale farms are 5 to 50 hectares, and bigger farms are large-scale. \n\n\n\n These definitions are based on a 2006 national household survey, it says. But it also current national agricultural policy defines small farms as 0.2 hectares to 3 hectares, medium as 3 to 49 hectares and large as 50 to 30,000 hectares. \n\n\n\n A smallholder farmer \u201ccurrently and commonly\u201d referred to someone with \u201c10 acres (4 hectares) and below\u201d, Dr \n\n\n\n , an engineer in rural development who works with smallholder farmers, said a small-scale farm was considered to be between 0.5 acres (0.2 hectares) and 5 acres (2 hectares). \n\n\n\n says there \u201cis no unique and unambiguous definition of a smallholder farmer\u201d. Context matters, because farm size, or income, or even agricultural output have been used to categorise farmers, the UN agency adds. \n\n\n\n \u201cThe statistical definition of a smallholder is, therefore, very difficult,\u201d the FAO says. But even with these difficulties, \u201csmallholder farmers do exist\u201d, and countries define them according to local conditions. \n\n\n\n In Kenya, \u201cthe typical smallholder farm size is 0.47 hectares\u201d, the study based on a 2-hectare threshold, classifying farmers who hold less than this as smallholders would result in them accounting for nearly all of the country\u2019s arable sector. \n\n\n\nHow did the ministry arrive at this figure?\n\nThe ministry\u2019s estimate of 4.5 million small-scale farmers came out of calculations of data from the 2016 economic survey,\n\nusing data from the\n\n, \u201cdifferent assumptions based on county level populations\u201d and \u201cinformation from the\n\nI don't know how they estimate from [the social accounting matrix] the number of smallholder farmers in Kenya, because satellite [\n\n] accounts with physical data has not been published,\u201d Prof Alfredo Mainar Causap\u00e9, the lead author of the 2014 social accounting matrix, told Africa Check.\n\non the subject, and directed Africa Check to the the statistics bureau\u2019s\n\nIt shows that since 2012, small farms have produced 73% of Kenya\u2019s marketed agricultural crop.\n\nas between 0.2 hectares and 12 hectares, much larger than the agriculture ministry\u2019s two definitions. It also includes some farms \u201coutside this range\u201d.\n\nBut neither the 10-year plan nor the other documents give an estimate of the\n\nAccurately estimating the number of smallholder farmers in Kenya is \u201cusually very difficult\u201d, Dr\n\n, a development economist and research fellow at agriculture think-tank the\n\nHe said this is because Kenya has never done an agricultural census.\n\nSuch a census would provide an exact number of farmers, their individual enterprises, the amount of land they used and any investments such as in workers and inputs, Njagi said.\n\nThe estimate of 70% to 80% was old, Dr\n\n, an engineer in rural development who works with smallholder farmers, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThese are numbers that have been thrown around for the last three decades,\u201d Kaumbutho said. He added that there hadn\u2019t been a recent study on the extent of small-scale farming.\n\nMapping it out would help smallholder farmers. \u201cThese are people who need a lot of technological support, markets and subsidies from the government.\u201d\n\nConclusion: No data supports claim that 70% to 80% of Kenya\u2019s farmers are smallholders\n\nAt the launch of a World Bank report on improving farming in Kenya, agriculture ministry research head Prof Hamadi Boga said smallholder farmers, \u201cthe backbone of Kenya\u2019s agriculture\u201d, made up 70% to 80% of the country\u2019s farming community.\n\nThe data points to the\n\nof farmers in Kenya being smallholders, but doesn\u2019t give the total number of farmers. Kenya hasn\u2019t yet done an agricultural census, an expert said.\n\nFarm sizes are also defined differently. Without reliable data, Boga\u2019s claim cannot be proven at this time.", "lang": "en"}
