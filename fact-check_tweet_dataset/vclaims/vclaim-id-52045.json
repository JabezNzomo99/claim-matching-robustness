The ministry said that missile never left Ukrainian soil, contradicting the international Joint Investigative Team\u2019s (JIT) findings in May which placed the blame on Russia for the downing of the civilian airliner.\n\n\u200bNicolas Dhuicq, a spokesman for the Debout La France (the France Arise) party, told the Russia state media outlet Sputnik that Western \u201csilence\u201d following the defense ministry\u2019s latest release \u201cproves the integrity of the data.\u201d\n\nDhuicq, who holds the party's sole seat in the French National Assembly and lists Crimea as his location on his personal Twitter account, added that he \u201cpersonally\u201d had no reason to doubt Russia\u2019s findings.\n\nOn Monday, the JIT, tasked with probing the case, issued a statement saying it had \u201ctaken note of the information that has been publicly presented by the authorities of the Russian Federation for the first time today.\u201d The JIT went on to say that it had asked for the Russian Federation to provide \u201call relevant information\u201d as early as 2014, specifically requesting in May of this year \u201cinformation concerning numbers found on several recovered missile parts.\u201d\u200b\n\nThe JIT said it would \u201cmeticulously study\u201d the new material once the new documents are made available, adding that information previously provided by Russia \u201chad proven to be \u201cfactually inaccurate,\u201d citing the \u201calleged presence of a fighter plane in the vicinity of MH17 on radar imagery presented to the public on (at) a press conference in July 2014.\u201d\u200b\n\nDhuicq would later be quoted as saying that he believed Russia would not have benefited from shooting down the civilian airliner, claiming that the Ukrainian army at that time was very disorganized, while groups \u201cwere not under the center\u2019s [Kyiv's] control.\u201d\n\nHe further expressed doubt the airliner had been brought down by Pro-Russian separatists \u201cbecause shooting such a missile requires some training and organization.\"\n\nHowever, in 2016, the JIT presented the results of its criminal investigation, showing that Flight MH17 was shot down by a BUK missile from the 9M38 series. The missile was fired from a field in the area of Pervomaiskyi, which at the time was controlled by pro-Russian separatists.\n\nIn a hastily deleted social media post, separatist leader Igor Girkin boasted some 35 minutes after the downing of MH17 that \u201cthe militia of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DPR) have brought down a military transport Antonov-26 (An-26) plane of the Ukrainian Air Force on the outskirts of the town of Torez\u2026\u201d The town Girkin reffed to is located 10 miles South-East from Pervomaiskyi, indicated in the JIT investigation.\n\nOn July 23, 2014, Alexander Khodakovsky, commander of the separatists, told Reuters that pro-Russian rebels did possess the BUK missile system, adding it could have been sent back to Russia to remove proof of its presence.\n\nIn May 2018, the JIT presented new results of its investigation, saying \u201cthe BUK TELAR that shot down flight MH17 comes from the 53rd Antiaircraft Missile Brigade, or the 53rd Brigade from Kursk in the Russian Federation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
