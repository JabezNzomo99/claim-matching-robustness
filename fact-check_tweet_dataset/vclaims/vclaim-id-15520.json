The message posted along with the photograph claims, \u201cRare to find leaders like Indira Gandhi When Kiran Bedi booked a challan on PM\u2019s vehicle for wrong parking, Indira ji invited her for lunch personally at PMO to honor her fearless commitment towards duty\u201d. It suggests that Gandhi had invited Bedi for lunch after the latter had booked the Prime Minister\u2019s vehicle for illegal parking in Delhi.\n\nThis claim was reiterated with the same photograph by many other individuals on Twitter.\n\nAlt News found that the photo featuring Gandhi and Bedi has been placed out of context by social media users who have circulated it. It pertains to a meeting when Gandhi had invited Bedi for breakfast after the former saw Bedi leading the Republic Day parade in 1975. This photograph was also tweeted by Bedi in 2014.\n\nFor the longest time, Kiran Bedi was popularly referred to as \u201cCrane Bedi\u201d, with the claim that she personally towed Indira Gandhi\u2019s car. It may be noted that in the past, Bedi\u2019s Twitter bio itself had the claim, \u201cTowed PM\u2019s car for Traffic violation\u201d. The issue came to fore again in the run-up to the 2015 Delhi assembly election when Kiran Bedi was announced as the BJP\u2019s CM candidate. Kiran Bedi in an interview with NDTV (2015) had clarified that it was SI Nirmal Singh who actually towed the car by saying, \u201cSub-inspector Nirmal Singh towed it away\u201d. At the time of the incident, Bedi was the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic in Delhi.\n\nAn article published by NDTVin 2015 stated, \u201cIn 1982, an ambassador car that belonged to then prime minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s office was parked at the wrong spot and towed away by sub-inspector Nirmal Singh.\u201d In the video posted below, the relevant part can be heard.\n\nIn conclusion, the photograph now viral on social media is unrelated to the alleged incident of Kiran Bedi towing the Prime Minister\u2019s car, and represents an occasion when Bedi was invited for breakfast at the Prime Minister\u2019s residence.", "lang": "en"}
