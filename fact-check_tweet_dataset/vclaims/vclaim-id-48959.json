But FACTLY has found the video to be an old one. It is not related to any recent incident. The same video was found in an article published in July 2019. As per the article, the video shows an RPF Jawan in Surat taking bribe from bootlegger women. As the video went viral last year, the RPF Jawan was dismissed from service for taking bribe. More information about the incident can be found here and here.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
