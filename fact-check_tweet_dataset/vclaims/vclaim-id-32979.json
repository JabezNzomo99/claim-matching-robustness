These images were of an apparent Guardian article headlined \u201cLeaked emails expose turmoil at heart of Liberal Democrat leadership\u201d.\n\nThis article is a fake. The supposed author of the Guardian article, and real Guardian journalist, confirmed that he had not written such a piece. A quick Google search shows that no articles with such a headline exist on the Guardian\u2019s website.\n\nOther signs that the image is fake are that the headline font used is not quite the same as the Guardian\u2019s, and there is a stray letter and full stop (presumably from the original unedited image) which hasn\u2019t been fully removed in the second screenshot.\n\nThe fake Guardian article went on to falsely claim that Chuka Umunna (who joined the Liberal Democrats in June) had suggested a possible coup against their newly-elected leader, Jo Swinson, and also wrote \u201cIt\u2019s a fact the no-deal Brexit is the best possible outcome for the party\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about how to spot misleading images online here.", "lang": "en"}
