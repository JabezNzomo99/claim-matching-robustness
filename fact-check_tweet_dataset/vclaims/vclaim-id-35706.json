At the moment they are split equally between EU and non-EU migrants.\u201d\n\nThis appears to show the Home Office briefing two incompatible numbers. As economics professor Jonathan Portes pointed out, the total number of migrants who came from the EU for work in the year ending June 2019 totalled 90,000.\n\nIf there are only 90,000 EU migrants coming to the UK for work and roughly 32,500 (half of 65,000) are skilled, then around 57,500 must be unskilled. You can\u2019t reduce 57,500 by 90,000.\n\nProfessor Portes told us that migrants are only assessed as being skilled or unskilled if they are making a work visa application, not if they are planning to migrate to the UK for any other reason, such as joining family or for study.\n\nWe asked the Home Office for more details on the figures which, according to the Sunday Times, came from them. A spokesperson told us:\n\n\u201cWe will deliver on the people\u2019s priorities by introducing a points-based immigration system from 2021 to attract the brightest and best talent from around the world, while cutting low-skilled immigration and bringing overall numbers down. We will set out the details of this firmer and fairer new system in due course.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s inappropriate for government departments to use figures that aren\u2019t in the public domain, and figures like these should be published in full so that anyone can check where they\u2019re from and how they\u2019re calculated. We would ask the Home Office to publish its figures and methodology at the earliest opportunity.\n\nHow you might get to 90,000\n\nReducing the number of EU migrants by 90,000 could be mathematically possible if you looked at all EU migrants, not just those coming to the UK for work-related reasons.\n\nFor example, new laws could plan to reduce the number of both work-related migrants and non-work-related migrants.\n\nOr it\u2019s possible that by reducing the number of unskilled migrants, there\u2019s an associated reduction in the number of people migrating for non-work reasons (for example coming to stay with these workers under family visas).\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the Home Office briefed out-of-date-figures forecasting how much immigration might be reduced by, but which are not applicable now EU migration has dropped since the EU referendum.\n\nBut the Sunday Times mentions the figure specifically in the context of reducing the number of \u201cunskilled EU migrants.\u201d So even if the government\u2019s plans could lead to a fall in EU migration of 90,000 it\u2019s incorrect, based on the figures we have, to suggest that all of this will come from unskilled workers.", "lang": "en"}
