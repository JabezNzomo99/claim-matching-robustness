The flight, which lasted 12 hours, included training with Romania, Ukraine and Georgia bordering the Black Sea.\u201d\n\nDespite the U.S.A.F.\u2019s unwillingness to discuss the details of such missions, there are reasons to believe the B-52 was not Crimea-bound.\n\nSteffan Watkins, a Canadian open source intelligence research consultant mostly focused on ships, planes, and undersea cables, told Polygraph.info that not every such mission can automatically be assumed to be a simulated bombing mission.\n\nHe said that in the case of flights \u201cmore or less directly at Kaliningrad (or St. Petersburg \u2018behind\u2019 Kaliningrad),\u201d in which bombers make a \u201chairpin turn\u201d right before entering the Russian Flight Information Region, such missions are most likely simulated strikes.\n\nWatkins said that, based on its flight path, it does not appear that AFKAI12, which is nuclear-capable, \u201cwas lining up on any targets in Crimea\u201d on October 19.\n\n\u201cHowever, their flight path does suggest they could have been lining up a shot on Tehran, if you extend their flight path before they turned around, and they would have been within range to launch ALCMs (air launched cruise missiles) at Tehran from the Black Sea,\u201d he said.\n\nIt should be noted that the modern B-52 Stratofortress, while the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the U.S. strategic bomber force, \u201cis capable of dropping or launching the widest array of weapons in the U.S. inventory,\u201d according to Military.com.\n\nThe Federation of American Scientists said the aircraft was adapted in the 1980s, well beyond its nuclear mission, so that \u201cthe capabilities of the B-52 have been broadened to provide firepower across the spectrum of conflict.\u201d\n\nWhile there is an argument to be made that Russian media have manufactured a provocation near the occupied Crimean peninsula for propaganda purposes, without more information, Polygraph.info finds the latest claim by Sputnik to be unclear.", "lang": "en"}
