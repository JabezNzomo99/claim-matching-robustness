NDTV had also tweeted that Wickremesinghe had told them \u201cin principle, we have agreed to full autonomy to Tamil areas\u201d, as per a report in The Tamil Guardian.\n\nSri Lanka's The Nation newspaper had contacted Wickremesinghe to verify whether he had made such a statement, the report added. \u2018No, no, no... What I said was that I am for the implementation of the 13th Amendment and that I am for the unitary state,\u201d Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had told the paper. Following this, The Nation had accused NDTV of deliberately distorting the prime minister's statement on this \"highly sensitive matter to all Sri Lankans\".", "lang": "en"}
