Some readers wondered why we still bother to vet her statements, but certainly there continues to be intense interest in what she says.\n\n#1: Sarah Palin\u2019s claim about China, U.S. debt and the \u2018foreign master\u2019\n\nWe focused on Palin\u2019s comment that U.S. debt holdings by China would leave future generations \u201cbeholden to a foreign master\u201d because her remarks do reflect some common misunderstanding about foreign holdings of Treasury securities. (We noted that Obama, as a candidate in 2008, had made similar comments.) China owns the most public debt, but even so that only represents about 10 percent of all publicly held Treasury securities. Rising debt is a big risk to the long-term health of the U.S. economy, but not the fact that foreign governments may own a portion of that debt.\n\n2: Obama\u2019s pledge that \u2018no one will take away\u2019 your health plan\n\nSecond place goes to our lengthy examination of the president\u2019s memorable pledge that, under the Affordable Care Act, \u201cno one will take away\u201d your health plan. Though the White House has since backed off this claim \u2014 made repeatedly by the president during the crafting of the law and in recent months \u2014 we concluded that it was worthy of Four Pinocchios because of the frequency with which he made it and because of the impact of regulations crafted by the administration. As we noted, this was also the most popular fact check of October.\n\n3: The White House effort to blame insurance companies for lost plans\n\nHere, we dug deeper into the administration\u2019s effort to extricate itself from the controversy over the president\u2019s pledge \u2014 such as accusing insurance companies of stripping away benefits. But as we explained, the main culprit is not whether or not an insurance company had changed a plan that ran afoul of the administration\u2019s regulations, but the law\u2019s effective date. In fact, we calculated that as many as 95 percent of people now getting cancellation notices likely purchased their plan after the effective date of the law.\n\n4: False claims about a health-care memo persist even after testimony\n\nRepublican efforts to probe the disastrous rollout of the health-care law took a detour when GOP lawmakers touted a memo as showing that the personal information of millions of Americans was at risk. It turns out there was much less to the memo than originally claimed, but that did not stop lawmakers from repeating their claims on television after the hearing. Information may yet emerge about the law\u2019s protection of personal information, but lawmakers need to learn to adjust their talking points before going on TV.\n\n5: A cautionary tale for politicians: Al Gore and the \u2018invention\u2019 of the Internet\n\nThis history lesson about Al Gore\u2019s famous gaffe generated surprising interest, demonstrating that it still has resonance. We noted that his statement never said he \u201cinvented\u201d the Internet, but it was so self-centered that it obscured the fact that as a legislator, he did help advance funding for research that helped foster the Internet. A gaffe sticks if it somehow validates preconceived notions about a politician. So even though Gore was one of the first politicians to grasp the importance of interconnected computers, with one awkward phrase, he managed to obscure his accomplishments and instead become a recurring punch line. No Pinocchios were awarded, which some readers thought was a mistake, as the column was pegged off a recent reference by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R).", "lang": "en"}
