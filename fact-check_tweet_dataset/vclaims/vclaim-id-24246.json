We want it all fixed!\u201d\n\nSome users who commented on the posts that were attributed to Harvey praised the entertainer\u2019s supposed prose. \u201cMr. Harvey speaks and thinks with common since [sic],\u201d one user wrote. But Harvey didn\u2019t write it.\n\nHarvey officially endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on his radio show in March 2016. He did meet with Trump in January 2017 to discuss housing issues, but last year Harvey called Trump \u201cone of the most immoral presidents we\u2019ve ever had in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nThe writing about raccoons actually appears to have originated as part of a submission to the conservative website 100percentfedup.com, which published it in March 2016 \u2014 before Trump officially clinched the Republican nomination for president. The website wrote that \u201cthis letter was sent to 100% FED Up! by an anonymous author,\u201d who was only identified as an \u201c80 year old American.\u201d\n\nThe letter also was republished on the well-known conspiracy theory website InfoWars two days later.\n\nAfter that, it took on a life of its own.\n\nIn April 2016, an honorary co-chair of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in New York invoked the same analogy in a radio interview, saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what kind of person is the exterminator, OK? They want the raccoons out of the basement.\u201d\n\nIn February 2018, the deputy mayor of a New Jersey town posted the piece on Facebook, prompting an outcry that led to his resignation.\n\nThen, in September 2018, the post again drew attention \u2014 when the Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor, Scott Wagner, recited parts of it while addressing his supporters, referring to it as \u201cthe raccoon story.\u201d Democrats condemned the tale as racist, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported, and a Wagner spokesman told the newspaper that Wagner had read the account \u201cin an email that had been sent to him.\u201d\n\nOnline deceptions have long leveraged celebrities in an attempt to make political points: We\u2019ve debunked false claims about Miley Cyrus, Kurt Russell and Jennifer Aniston, among others.\n\nIn this case, there may be an explanation for the erroneous attribution. A search of public posts on Facebook for \u201cSteve Harvey\u201d and \u201cHOW I FEEL ABOUT TRUMP\u201d shows that one user who posted the text on Facebook in January \u2014 earning some 160,000 shares \u2014 had something in common with the TV host: His name on the platform is also Steve Harvey. But it is not the account for the comedian.\n\nSome who posted the same text after it went viral did so with a credit that reads, \u201cCOPIED FROM STEVE HARVEY.\u201d\n\n\u201cDEAR RNC: An Everyday American Writes A Letter To Explain The Trump Phenomenon.\u201d 100percentfedup.com.\n\nSeidman, Andrew. \u201cScott Wagner, Republican nominee for governor, shares story about \u2018raccoon\u2019 infestation, invasion.\u201d The Philadelphia Inquirer. 20 Sep 2018.", "lang": "en"}
