Others were incredulous.\n\n\"Do you really think he is holding that sign?!!!\" one account wrote.\n\n\"Why does it matter to you what I think?\" another account replied. \"Apparently lots of others thought so too.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Trump is actually holding a proclamation he signed on May 7, 2018, during an event in the Rose Garden for Melania Trump\u2019s \"Be Best\" initiative. You can see many Associated Press photos from that day here and here.\n\nIn April, Snopes fact-checked a similar Facebook post that appeared to show Trump holding a T-shirt that said, \"No matter who is president Jesus is still king.\" That one was also doctored. The original image shows the president holding a jersey with his name and the number \"45\" on the back, according to Snopes.", "lang": "en"}
