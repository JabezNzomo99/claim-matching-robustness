We can only sympathise with the cabin crew\u201d, claims a Facebook post that enclosed a video that shows disgusting condition of an aircraft cabin. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The video showing the disgusting condition of an aircraft cabin travelled by persons with skull caps is on Air India flight. Fact: The footage was filmed on Saudia Airlines flight from Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Hence, the claim that it is an Air India flight stands FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes were returned. On subjecting these keyframes to Google Reverse Image Search technique, a certain keyframe directed to an article of \u201cGulf Business\u201d newspaper. As per this article, this incident has taken place on an inaugural flight from Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. This flight belonged to Saudia Airlines (also known as Saudi Arabia Airlines).\n\nWhen searched with keywords to find reports on this incident by any other news agencies, an article of \u201cDaily Mail\u201d was found. In this article, a video was also included and this is the same video as in the post. The Daily mail reported that this video recording of the aircraft cabin is on a Saudia Airlines flight from Jeddah. This article was published in 2016.\n\nDuring our search process, it was found that, earlier, this video was also in circulation alleging that the flight shown in the video belonged to British Airways. AFP FactCheck organisation has written a fact-check article on it.\n\nTo summarize, this video doesn\u2019t show an aircraft cabin on Air India flight. It is that of a Saudia Airlines flight.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
