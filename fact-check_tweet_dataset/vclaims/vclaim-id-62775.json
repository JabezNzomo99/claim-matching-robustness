As a matter of fact, there is no change in the position of the stone in both the pictures.\n\nIn the above collage, we can see that the stone is lying in the same place. However, the angle from where the image has been taken creates an illusion that he is holding the stone.\n\nMoreover, none of the media reports mentioned that the kid was holding a stone at any point in time during the entire ordeal.\n\nHence, from the above information, we can conclude that the post in circulation is misleading and false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
