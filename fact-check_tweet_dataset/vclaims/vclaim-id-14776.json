A Twitter user @Lorrykaran who describes himself as the media cell district secretary of BJP Thoothukdi was among those who shared the screenshot.\n\nSeveral people believed the Twitter exchange to be true.\n\nThere are several clues which indicate that the Twitter exchange was manufactured.\n\nTwitter has a character count limit of 280 and the reply ascribed to the union minority affairs minister has visibly crossed the limit.\n\n2. No active exchange between the duo found on Twitter\n\nThere are no active replies by Naqvi to Barkha Dutt.
