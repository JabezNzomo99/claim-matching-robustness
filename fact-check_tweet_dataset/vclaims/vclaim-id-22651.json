By giving this description along with the video, the user tries to imply how the TMC goons in the garb of \"bhagwa goons\" were involved in the violence that broke out during the roadshow of BJP president Amit Shah in Kolkata on May 14.\n\nMost social media users took the video literally, believing that the video was from the recent Kolkata violence. At the time of filing this story, this tweet gathered more than 7,500 retweets and around 8,400 likes.\n\nIndia Today's Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is about a week-old and is from Jharkhand's Jamshedpur, not West Bengal.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nTwitter user Ravi Singh uploaded the video with the caption, \"Real Name - Mohammad Nisar Orange T-shirt, Tilak on Forhead (sic). Now you can understand many things. You can also connect this to the so called 'Bhagwa Goons' doing Violence during Amit Shah Road Show in Kolkata, They were all TMC Goons.\"\n\nAs his tweet attracted controversy followed by the blame game between the TMC and BJP, Ravi defended saying he had never claimed that the video is from Kolkata.\n\nThe video is also viral on Facebook.\n\nWe spotted a comment in the Twitter thread by a user @madhu_ganeriwal. He mentioned that the video is of the incident that took place in Jamshedpur on May 12 when two groups got into a scuffle over elections.\n\nTo confirm the incident, we ran a search on the internet and found a news bulletin video of News18 which reported about the clashes in Jamshedpur's Jugsalai. At 2 minute and 19 second, the same man can be seen detained by police. On the May 12 voting day, a scuffle broke out in Jugsalai and local police had to fire tear gas shells and lathicharge to control the situation.\n\nWe also found the news report in Times of India according to which the clashes broke out between the BJP and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) workers outside the polling booth in Jugsalai. Two accused were also arrested. Boomlive also debunked the claim.\n\nHence, it is clear that the viral video is not from West Bengal but Jamshedpur.", "lang": "en"}
