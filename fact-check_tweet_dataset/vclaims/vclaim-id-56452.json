The claim is misleading; the clips have circulated separately online since July 2017 and January 2020 respectively.\n\nThe footage was shared on Facebook here on June 19, 2020. It has been viewed more than 3,000 times since.\n\nThe four-minute 49-second video consists of two clips: the first clip shows troops embroiled in a heated discussion in English and Mandarin in a mountainous region; the second clip shows a scuffle between several uniformed troops.\n\nThe Facebook post's caption reads: \u201cLast video of Col.Santhosh Babu trying to pacify Chinese soldiers.Even while he was talking, Chinese soldiers bullied him.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Indian Army, Colonel Bikumalla Santosh Babu was one of at least 20 Indian soldiers killed on June 15 in a fatal clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley, which lies along the Chinese-Indian border.\n\nThe confrontation marked the first deadly incident in a long-running border dispute between the two countries in decades, AFP reported here.\n\nThe video was shared alongside a similar claim here and here on Facebook.\n\nRegional Telugu-language TV news channels in India also posted the video alongside similar claims on YouTube here and here. The videos gained combined views of nearly 2.5 million.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading; both clips shared in the misleading posts circulated online long before Colonel Babu was killed in June 2020.\n\nThe first clip was published on YouTube here on January 13, 2020, several months before the deadly Galwan Valley incident.\n\nThe video shows a Chinese soldier arguing with Indo Tibetan Border Police in the northeast Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, according to the YouTube post. Arunachal Pradesh is over 3,000 km from the Galwan Vally, as seen on Google Maps here.\n\nAFP debunked a similar misleading claim about the video here in May 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the first clip in the video in the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video from in January 2020 (R):\n\nA reverse image search on Google with video keyframes extracted using InVID-WeVerify, a digital verification tool, found the second clip was published here on July 7, 2017, nearly three years before the June 2020 incident.\n\nThe video, uploaded to the verified YouTube channel of Indian newspaper Deccan Herald, is titled: \u201cWatch: Jawans stop Chinese soldiers from entering Indian territory part 1.\u201d\n\nBelow are screenshot comparisons of the footage video in the misleading post (L) and the Deccan Herald video from July 2017 (R):", "lang": "en"}
