It continued to circulate in July 2019.\n\nThe story originated on a pro-Democrat Facebook page in February 2017, around the time of the senate confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos to be Trump's education secretary. The fake tweet was recently shared in a post (archived here) published on July 21, 2019. Trump's purported tweet from February 14, 2017 read:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nIt is not difficult to create a fake tweet image:\n\nWhile President Trump is known to post tweets offensive to many, such a message as this would have created an unforgettable outrage. Again, the president never tweeted this. It was never on his timeline.", "lang": "en"}
