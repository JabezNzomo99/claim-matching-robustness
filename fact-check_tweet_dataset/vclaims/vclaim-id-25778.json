That\u2019s it. He went abroad and continued to cooperate, consulting some intelligence services there,\u201d said Putin.\n\nIn fact, Western media have uniformly referred to Skripal either as a spy or military intelligence agent.\n\nAFP, in a report carried by CBS, called Skripal \u201ca former military intelligence colonel who was jailed for betraying Russian agents to Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence service.\u201d\n\nThe BBC has described him both as a \u201cformer spy\u201d and \u201cformer Russian double agent\u201d who was \u201cconvicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6.\u201d\n\nFox News reported that Skripal \u201cprovided information about GRU agents in Europe, receiving over $100,000 in return.\u201d\n\nFox also cited Russian media reports that quoted Russia\u2019s FSB domestic security agency as saying \u201cthe damage from his activities could be compared to harm inflicted by Oleg Penkovsky, a GRU (Russian military intelligence) colonel who spied for the United States and Britain. Penkovsky was executed in 1963.\u201d\u200b\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation similarly described Skripal as a former Russian military intelligence colonel who \u201cwas charged with \u2018high treason in the form of espionage\u2019 and sentenced to 13 years in prison.\u201d\n\nUSA Today reported that Skripal was working as a Russian military intelligence officer when the United Kingdom recruited him \u201cto pass state secrets on to MI6.\u201d\n\nRegarding his motives and his character, while not always negative, few descriptions in Western media could be construed as particularly glowing.\n\nFor example, on September 9, the New York Times ran a piece characterizing Skripal as a \u201csmall fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is how British officials now describe Mr. Skripal, a Russian intelligence officer they recruited as a spy in the mid-1990s,\u201d the NYT reported.\n\nOne former associate, Oleg Ivanov, who worked with Skripal in the Moscow regional governor\u2019s office, said he was \u201calways looking for side hustles.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy his psychological type, he was a materialist,\u201d Mr. Ivanov told the NYT. \u201cHe simply loved money.\u201d\n\nAs the paper noted, Ivanov \u201cfound Skripal\u2019s betrayal, if not especially honorable, at least comprehensible.\u201d\n\nSpiegel Online similarly called Skripal a \u201cperipheral figure,\u201d adding the former spy did not \u201cseem to have made much of an impression on the people who know him.\u201d\n\nThe Mirror, calling him a spy, double agent and colonel in Russian military intelligence, said neighbors described him as \u201cquiet\u201d and \u201ccasually dressed,\u201d but not a human rights defender.\n\nOther outlets have reported that Skripal had \u201ccontinued to cooperate\u201d with Western intelligence.\n\nThe Guardian, for example, said Skripal \u201chad betrayed the motherland but admitted his crime.\u201d In another report, the paper hypothesized that the \u201cdemonstrative killing of a traitor could be a warning to junior officers not to follow the same path.\u201d\n\nThe paper went on: \u201cOne possible reason is that Skripal was being punished for a continuing relationship with British intelligence, or the suspicion of one.\u201d\n\nCNN mirrored that framing, calling Skripal a \u201cformer GRU officer who arrived in the UK with a pardon as a result of a spy swap in 2010,\u201d adding he \u201cwas active again \u2013 with the connivance or encouragement of the UK intelligence services.\u201d\n\nBased on dozens of reports from as many Western media sources, we found no outlet that ever referred to Skripal as anything other than what he was -- a former spy convicted of treason and potentially poisoned for once again returning to intelligence gathering activities.\n\nPutin, during his annual Q&A in 2010, had warned of a harsh fate for traitors, saying they would \u201cchoke on their 30 pieces of silver.\u201d\n\nBut Skripal\u2019s character has played no part in staunch Western opposition to the deployment of military grade chemical weapons on British soil. Likewise, while Skripal was never portrayed as a human rights defender.\n\nA joint statement on the attack, signed by British Prime Minister Theresa May, President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, read:\n\n\"[The Skripal poisoning] is an assault on UK sovereignty and any such use by a State party is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and a breach of international law. It threatens the security of us all.\u201d\n\nAnd so we find that Putin\u2019s claim that Skripal has been portrayed as \u201csome sort of human rights defender,\u201d and that the ensuing media firestorm has been \u201cartificially\u201d blown out of proportion, is false.", "lang": "en"}
