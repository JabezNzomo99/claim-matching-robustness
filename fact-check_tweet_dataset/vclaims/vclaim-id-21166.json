In the words of the Office for National Statistics (ONS): \u201cThere are no official figures that show how many students do not emigrate and remain in the UK after their studies.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, the available evidence is contradictory. Most student immigrants come from outside the EU on a temporary visa, and a minority still have the right to remain after a few years. Diane Abbott\u2019s office pointed us to figures showing this via a Universities UK report, as well as a Times article showing that a small minority of students overstay their visas.\n\nAt the same time, figures showing how many former international students emigrate are much lower than the figures for students immigrating to the UK. If accurate, that indicates many more students are remaining in the UK than the visa figures would suggest.\n\nThe ONS and others are working to improve the evidence we have in this area.\n\nInternational students are adding to the UK population\n\nEven though we can\u2019t be sure of all the figures, we do know that student immigration is adding to the UK population overall. Not all students who come to the UK return home. The challenge is measuring how many do so, and explaining what\u2019s happening to those who don\u2019t.\n\nWe don\u2019t have precise answers to either question. Most statistics don\u2019t follow individual immigrants and the routes they take through education and beyond. Our main migration estimates, for example, just look at snapshots of one set of people arriving and another set leaving.\n\nThe ONS says these main estimates provide \u201cthe only currently available data source that identifies when a student emigrates.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, these suggest most immigrant students aren\u2019t actually emigrating.\n\nIn 2016, an estimated 588,000 people immigrated to the UK \u2013 that is, they intended to stay here for at least a year. Of those, 136,000 said the main reason they came was to study. At the same time, about 63,000 former student immigrants left the UK.\n\nWe can\u2019t just compare 136,000 to 63,000 here. They\u2019re actually from slightly different sets of data, but more significantly they\u2019re not the same people: those 63,000 people will have been immigrants from previous years.\n\nBut that gap has been fairly consistent over the past few years. In every year since 2012 around 100,000 more student immigrants have arrived than former student emigrants have left. And each year the emigration of former students has accounted for less than half of student immigration.\n\nSo what\u2019s happening to these students if they\u2019re not all emigrating? The ONS offers three main suggestions:\n\u2022 Students might be staying longer than expected through legitimate means, like getting extensions on their visas for further study or to move into work.\n\u2022 They might be overstaying their visas, so breaking the law.\n\u2022 The statistics could be missing students.\n\nMost student immigrants come from outside the EU on a temporary visa. They have the option to stay longer in the UK by extending their visa, either to continue study or move into a different category such as a work visa. In 2016, there were around 44,000 such extensions. That figure is falling rapidly: three years ago it was over 112,000.\n\nBy comparison the number of non-EU immigrants coming to study was estimated at about 92,000 last year, and 122,000 three years ago. Again, those figures don\u2019t cover the same group of people, so can\u2019t be compared directly.\n\nEarlier this year, the Home Office also published figures tracking the journey of a group of immigrants who had arrived to the UK on a study visa in 2010 over several years.\n\nOf those issued a study visa in 2010, nearly half saw it expire within two years, showing that many will have been on short courses. After five years, only 19% still had valid leave to remain and 1% had indefinite leave to remain.\n\nThat\u2019s as far as these figures go \u2013 they don\u2019t actually confirm what people do after their temporary visa expires.\n\nFor obvious reasons, we don\u2019t know a huge amount about how many students are overstaying their visas in the UK.\n\nDiane Abbott\u2019s office pointed us to a Times report describing a leaked Home Office study which suggested that only a small minority of international students break the terms of their visa by staying in the UK after their course finishes.\n\nWithout seeing more detail, it\u2019s difficult to judge the accuracy of this report. The government says the work is \u201cnot completed\u201d.\n\nThese immigration figures cover students who say they intend to stay in the UK for at least a year \u2013 following the UN definition of who counts as an immigrant. That means some students aren\u2019t counted here, for example those who come for a single year course: they arrive in September and leave the following summer. On the same basis, the emigration figures only cover students who intend to leave the UK for more than a year\n\nThat means it\u2019s possible that some students are slipping past these particular figures. This could be because they leave the UK within a year, or because they only end up leaving the UK temporarily. However, ONS analysis suggests that neither of these possible counting methods fully explains the gap between students immigrating to the UK and former students emigrating.\n\nThe figure below shows recent work by the ONS \u2013 using data from 2015 in this case \u2013 to visualise all the possible things that could be happening to non-EU students who\u2019ve previously immigrated to study here.", "lang": "en"}
