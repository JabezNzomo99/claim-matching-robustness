On putting the picture through Reverse Image Search on the Russian search engine, Yandex, we found the same picture in a blog dated March 5, 2014, on NatureForver, a blogging website.\n\nAccording to the blog, the picture was taken in a rice mill warehouse in Andhra Pradesh, India.\n\nThough NewsMobile could not independently verify the origin of the picture, but, the above information establishes that the picture in question is old as it was already on the internet much before the lockdown came into effect in India.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
