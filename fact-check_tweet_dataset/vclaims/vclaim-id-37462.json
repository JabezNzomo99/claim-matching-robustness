They are praying for the Muslim Kingdom in India.\u201d At the time of writing this article, the video had 10,000 views. The post is now deleted.\n\nAnother page NaMo Mantra:- Nation FIRST shared the video with the identical narrative and later took it down.\n\nThe clip has been circulated on Twitter as well, including by those followed by railway minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s office (1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nIn fact, the video is viral on social media.\n\nIt has also been shared with the message \u2013 \u201c\u0925\u094b\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0932 \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u094b\u0917\u0947 \u0924\u094b 4 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092a\u092a\u094d\u092a\u0941\u092e\u093e\u092b\u0940\u092e\u093e\u0902\u0917\u0924\u0947\u0939\u0941\u090f\u0928\u091c\u0930\u0906\u090f\u0917\u093e\u201d \u2013 after the conclusion of 2020 Delhi Assembly elections. The message translates to, \u201cIf you make this viral Pappu will beg for forgiveness in four days. \u201c\n\nAlt News had debunked the same video when it was viral in December 2018 with claims that Gandhi converted to Islam after the assembly elections.\n\nHowever, the truth is that the video depicts the Congress President paying tribute at Ambedkarnagar\u2019s Kichhocha Sharif Dargah. We had found a December 10, 2016 video uploaded by news organisation Sahara Samay, which reported, \u201cAfter attending a meeting at Shivbaba in Ambedkar Nagar, UP, Rahul Gandhi reached the famous Sharif Kichhocha dargah and on the tomb of Makhdoom Sahab, offered tribute\u201d (approximate translation).\n\nThis news was also reported on September 10, 2016 byAaj Tak with the headline, \u201cRahul Gandhi pays tribute at Ambedkarnagar\u2019s famous Kichhocha Sharif dargah\u201d (approximate translation).\n\nRahul Gandhi has often found himself in the crosshairs of misinformation attempting to portray him as a Muslim sympathiser. Earlier, his photograph shot during a temple visit in MP was viral was him offering Namaz.\n\n[Update: The same video was revived after the conclusion of Delhi Assembly elections. The viral link has been added to the report.]", "lang": "en"}
