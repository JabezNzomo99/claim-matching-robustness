Text above the photo suggests that the product can be used to avoid the flu if it is applied inside the nostrils daily.\n\n\"With this horrible flu going around, This is what the nurses at UAMS tell the MM patients to do when they have to go out in public!\" the post adds.\n\nScreenshot of a Facebook post taken on February 20, 2020\n\nUAMS is likely the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
