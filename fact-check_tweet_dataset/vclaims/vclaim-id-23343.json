According to news reports like this one, reserved and unused EVMs were brought in from Sakaldiha, one of the assembly segments under Chandauli parliamentary constituency.\n\nHowever, the Opposition, including Samajwadi party MLA Prabhunarayan Yadav, protested against the vehicle's entry in the strong room area. Yadav can be seen in the viral video as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the Election Commission spokesperson tweeted on May 21 saying, \"Clarification issued by RO (Returning Officer) with respect to mishandling of EVMs in Chandauli, UP. All extant guidelines issued by ECI followed.\"\n\nThis tweet also contains a letter written by the district magistrate to Lucknow-based chief election officer giving details of the incident.\n\nThe letter states, \"After voting and scrutiny ended on May 20,2019, the assistant returning officer sent these machines from Sakaldiha tehsil temporary strong room by vehicle to be kept in the allocated strong room No. 9 at Navin Krishi Mandi Samiti, Chandauli. Political parties had been informed beforehand about this along with the strong room number where it was to be kept. (A photo of this has been attached)\".\n\nAccording to the DM, proper procedure for unused reserve EVMs was followed.\n\nNews about the protest and the DM's clarification can be read here.\n\nIt is clear that the issue had emanated from unused reserve EVMs being brought to the Chandauli strong room area.
