The fake article has been circulating at least for a few months on Facebook. The end of the article directs readers to Channel50news, a prank website.\n\nThe dateline on the story says Sept. 20, 2016, but when we read the oldest comments at the bottom of the story, they started on Sept. 20, 2017.\n\nAnother hint that this is fake news is that the three-paragraph article has typos or sentences that make no sense:\n\n\"President Trump claims he will no longer for any party of parent to pay child support. Trump also says that ant reports of abuse or negligence to a child from either party will result in the child automatically being turned over to the State Child Welfare.\"\n\nWhile this fake story suggests that the federal government is wiping out child support, it\u2019s worth noting that states set child support policies and have enforcement programs.\n\nWe emailed the authors of the website and did not get a reply.\n\nA story stated that a law will end all child support in the United States in 2018, but no such law has been passed. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
