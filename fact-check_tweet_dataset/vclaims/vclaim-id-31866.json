K Parthasarthi, former minister and spokesperson, YSRCP, said, \"He is a true believer of Jesus. But he respects all religions. At the request of people he might visit temples or do a pooja. But that does not mean he has converted to any other religion or Hinduism. These allegations are baseless and shameless.\"\n\nBOOM also found the same video uploaded on YSRCP's official YouTube account, YSRCPofficial on August 10, 2016.\n\nSakshi TV, which is owned by Reddy, carried the same video as in the viral posts with a caption, \"YS Jagan Performs Homam in Rishikesh For Special Status to AP\".
