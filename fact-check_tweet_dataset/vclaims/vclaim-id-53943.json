The viral clip, made on video-sharing social media app TikTok, is accompanied by a message that reads 'Some important information from Kasturba Hospital corona chief Doctor. Please listen carefully and follow if you have any symptoms. Please Share maximum'. BOOM found that, both, the information shared in the video and caption accompanying it are false.\n\nThe 30-second-long video shows a man, with a face mask on, saying 'According to information till now, Coronavirus stays in the throat for four days before infecting the lungs. This leads to coughing, throat infection and pain. If the infected person drinks a lot of water, gargles with salt-and-vinegar hot water, Coronavirus can be cured. Please share this widely. Help save someone's life'.\n\nAlso read False: Salt Or Vinegar Warm Water Gargle Eliminates The Coronavirus\n\nWatch the video below and check its archived version here.\n\n\n\nAlso read Message Claiming Coronavirus Can Last Up To 8 Hours In Air Is Misleading\n\nSimilar claims have also been shared from several Twitter handles earlier too.\n\nThe viral claim that gargling with hot salt-vinegar water helps cure Coronavirus has been debunked earlier too.\n\nBOOM checked the official recommendations of World Health Organization (WHO) under 'Protection Measures for Everyone' and did not find 'gargling' or 'drinking hot water' in the list. Further, an AFP Fact Check mentions that gargling with hot water is not a remedy for novel coronavirus, a dreaded disease that has killed 17,156 worldwide and 9 in India till now.\n\nThe viral clip meanwhile led BOOM to the original TikTok account - that of Subhasha Yadav - where the video was first shared. Yadav has made several TikTok videos related to Coronavirus, as can be seen from his feed.\n\nSubhasha Yadav had lip-synced a pre-recorded message for this viral clip. When we traced the source of the pre-recorded audio clip, BOOM found a total of 6,165 videos with the same message. The videos can be viewed here.\n\nBOOM also contacted Dr Chandrakant Pawar, Public Relations Officer at Kasturba hospital to get more information on the video. We could not reach him. We will update this report as soon as we hear from him.", "lang": "en"}
