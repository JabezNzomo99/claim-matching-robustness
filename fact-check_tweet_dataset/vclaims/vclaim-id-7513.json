A similar story has appeared on various websites since 2016.\n\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed.

Then, the story went, archaeologists associated with Niagara University and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard determined that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II and recovered it.\n\nBut we found no legitimate news articles stating that such a sunken ship was recently discovered.\n\nThe story included a photo of a rusted submarine. Snopes found in 2016 that the photo was an unrelated image of a rusting, decommissioned Russian submarine from the Cold War era.\n\nThe story quoted Mark Carpenter, a supposed professor at the Niagara University. Thomas Burns, a spokesman for the university, said they do not have a professor by that name.\n\nThe Coast Guard told PolitiFact that the story about a recent discovery of a Nazi submarine in the Great Lakes is false. However, something similar has happened in the past.\n\n\"Years ago the Navy brought a WWII submarine onto the Great Lakes and at some point sank the submarine. So there is a WWII submarine sunken in the Great Lakes, but the Coast Guard didn\u2019t work with Niagara University to recover a sunken WWII German submarine,\" the Coast Guard said in a statement.\n\nABC 7 Eyewitness News in Chicago reported in 2013 about the history of a sunken German submarine in Lake Michigan.\n\nThe German mine-laying sub U-C 97 was brought to the midwest on tour in the summer of 1919.\n\n\"The U-Boat was on tour. It was kind of a post-war, 'we won' tour, and so people got to go on to it and see it, and then as a condition of the armistice, it had to be sunk,\" Pritzker Military Library CEO Ken Clarke told ABC news.\n\nIn June of 1921, the sub was sunk by the military.\n\nBut in this case, the story declaring that a mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII was discovered in Great Lakes is made up.
