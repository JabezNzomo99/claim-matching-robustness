The full text of the prank simply read:\n\nThis is a corporate decision,all employees will be paid their wages until Dec.24th. Spokesman said \"we are just losing money too fast by selling so cheap. Read more by clicking the link\n\nOf course there was no actual link to click on, just a huge \"Share on Facebook\" button. It seems many people mistook that button for a \"read more\" link and shared the story anyway after realizing their mistake.\n\nReact365 is a prank website where users can submit their own headline, description and photo to create realistic looking prank news articles.\n\nUsers don't even need to upload their own image, there is a built-in search function that will pull an appropriate image from Google image search.\n\nSo if you encounter anyone sharing this 'news' as true on social media, you can safely value their opinion at $0 or less.", "lang": "en"}
