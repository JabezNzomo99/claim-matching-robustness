This report has since undergone several drastic rewrites but can still be found using the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine.\n\nThe agency claimed to have been informed by a \u201cmilitary-diplomatic source\u201d that they had reports, \u201cconfirmed by several channels\u201d of a group of Al Jazeera stringers filming staged chemical attacks in three rebel-held settlements in Idlib Province - Saraqib, Ariha and Jisr al-Shugour.\n\nThe productions supposedly involved the use of \u201caround 30 fire engines, an ambulance and up to 70 local residents with children, brought from a refugee camp,\u201d who were apparently paid thousands of Syrian pounds and given food for their labor. The resulting footage would then, the source claimed, be uploaded \u201cover the coming days until Sunday\u201d (May 7), by the \u201ccustomer and sponsor of the filming in one of the European countries.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Al Jazeera reacted swiftly to the claims, which had also been relayed by RIA Novosti\u2019s sister English-language outlet, Sputnik News, by releasing a statement that same day which described them as \u201cfake\u201d and amounting to \u201cdefamation punishable by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cAl Jazeera would like to stress that the network did not film any chemical attack material in Syria and that our organisation will continue its field coverage of the war in Syria with the objectivity the network is known for.\n\nAl Jazeera challenged Sputnik to prove any of its claims, to provide any evidence supporting these accusations, or to announce the source of the lie that they published.\n\nAl Jazeera maintains all its legal rights and will take legal action against Sputnik agency, which has committed a crime of defamation punishable by law in a number of developed countries.\u201d\n\nUnusually, RIA Novosti and Sputnik issued a retraction (of sorts) the following day, stating that the claims made by their source had \u201cnot been confirmed\u201d and apologizing to their readers, though not Al Jazeera directly:\n\n\u201cAfter a rigorous check, this information was not confirmed by other sources. The agency cannot consider this information credible and tenders apologies to its readers and subscribers.\u201d\n\nBut on May 8, the Russian outlets executed another U-turn, reporting now that the story had been \u201cconfirmed\u201d to them by the Russian Ministry of Defense\u2019s Center for the Reconciliation of the Warring Sides in Syria:\n\nThis third version of the story, carried quotes from the Center:\n\n\"According to information from a number of sources among local residents and opposition formations \u2026 special \u2018video brigades\u2019 carried out staged filming in the past week of the alleged consequences of shelling and airstrikes, including the use of \u2018poisonous substances\u2019,\" the reconciliation center said.\n\nThe center added that some of the \"consultants\" of the brigades were \"recognized by the locals as cameramen shooting news in the region for the Al-Jazeera channel,\" the center added.\n\nAl Jazeera has yet to respond to this reiteration of the claims, which are now backed by the Ministry of Defense itself.\n\nThe problem with assessing the veracity of the RIA and Sputnik claims is that the footage alleged to have been shot in Idlib Province has not been broadcast or uploaded over the weekend, as the original source claimed would happen. So there is no video to either corroborate or debunk the claims.\n\nInstead, we can only cast doubt on the Russian story by looking at the chain of evidence presented and evaluating the reliability of those sources.\n\nThe claims made by the Russian outlets rely solely on statements from within the black box of the Russian Ministry of Defense (presumably the origin of the first \u201cmilitary-diplomatic source\u201d) with no supporting evidence whatsoever.\n\nThe Russian government directly supports the regime of Bashar al-Assad and has repeatedly lied about the actions of both the Syrian and Russian militaries in that conflict, as demonstrated time and time again by Polygraph.info.\n\nFurthermore, the specific body to which the latest quote is attributed to, the Center for the Reconciliation of the Warring Sides in Syria, itself has a poor track record, once again documented on this site.\n\nIn comparison, Al Jazeera is a well-respected international news agency whose reports on the Syrian civil war have routinely corresponded with those from other media outlets and NGOs.\n\nIt should also be noted that the original, anonymous source for the story had framed their accusations against Al Jazeera as a continuation of an existing campaign of faking footage.\n\nFrom the archived May 4 version of the RIA report:\n\n\u201cThe effectiveness of the \u2018White Helmets\u2019\u2019 television spectacular with the staging of the supposed chemical attack with sarin by the Syrian authorities in Khan Sheikhoun has inspired the terrorists to continue shooting their \u2018television series.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis claim rests upon the notion that the Khan Sheikhoun sarin attack was staged. But there is an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that the rebel-held village was indeed attacked with sarin, with sources ranging from videos and statements made by medics and activists at the time of the attack, to witness testimony collected by reporters such as Kareem Shaheen of The Guardian, who visited the scene just two days later, and forensic analyses conducted by the French and U.S. intelligence services and finally, the Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Warfare.\n\nSince the Khan Sheikhoun attack did indeed happen, the claim made in the original RIA report - that rebel groups would \u201ccontinue\u201d fabricating such videos, rests on false grounds.\n\nThe rationale behind such statements from the Russian Ministry of Defense, and those made on April 11 [] by President Vladimir Putin, when he claimed that \u201csimilar provocations\u201d were being prepared in the suburbs of Damascus, may, as Al Jazeera suggested in their response to Sputnik, be far darker:\n\n\u201cAl Jazeera warns that the timing of the publication of such a false report may be a prelude to a real attack on civilians in Syria under the pretext of their published news and that it could be used to cover up the crimes committed by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by blaming others while the investigation into the chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun is ongoing...\n\nFinally, Al Jazeera would like to highlight to the international community its concern that if a chemical attack was launched, as it was described in Sputnik's fabricated article, then the Russian agency would be considered to be a conspirator with those involved.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
