Of the 9 convictions, 8 have been declared by elected members of the Arvind Kerjriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party, which won 62 seats in the new assembly, with the remaining 1 being of the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), who won the remaining 8. This implies that more than 10% of the Delhi's newly elected Assembly have declared convictions against them.

A re-elected Kejriwal as chief minister, and six other cabinet ministers, took oath of office on February 16.\n\nThe first two sub-sections of section 8 of the Representation of Peoples' Act, 1951, deals with specific Acts of Parliament and sections under the Indian Penal Code that disqualifies one for six years if fined; and if awarded a jail term, then for six years after a convict's release. Under the same section, a person convicted and serving a prison term for a period of two years or more (under law not lying in the first two sub-sections), the disqualification lasts for six years after his release.\n\n\n\nHalf the MLAs have serious criminal cases\n\n\n\nFurther, ADR also categorises 53% (or 37) of the 70 incoming MLAs to have serious criminal cases them. 61%, or 43 MLAs, have criminals cases against them.
