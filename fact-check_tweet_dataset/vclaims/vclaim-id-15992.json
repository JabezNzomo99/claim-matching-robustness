Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the video and claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: In the video, BJP party men and Police in Gujarat have obstructed Muslims from casting their votes in the election. Fact: This video was in circulation on several social media platforms before the commencement of the General Elections-2019. So, it is in no way related to any election day incident. Hence the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through the Invid, several keyframes were obtained. On using Google Reverse Image technique for each keyframe, a certain keyframe directed to a tweet of a user \u2018Sushma ji\u2019. She uploaded this video in a tweet on April 3, 2019, i.e. before the start of the phase-1 of General Elections-2019 (11th April 2019). Gujarat went to polls in the 3rd phase, on 23rd April, 2019. Hence this video is in circulation from much earlier than the actual poll dates.\n\nHence, a pre-election video from Gujarat is being circulated as BJP party men and police obstructing Muslims from voting in elections.", "lang": "en"}
