The same video taken from another angle is also being shared with the same claim. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Mohammad Pasha, the accused in the Hyderabad veterinary doctor rape-murder case, is being beaten up by the police in the video. Fact: The man in the video is not the accused in the Hyderabad veterinary doctor rape-murder case. The video is related to an alleged rape case in Chittoor. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe four people accused in the Hyderabad veterinary doctor rape-murder case are Mohammad Areef, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen, and Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu.\n\n\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the similar visuals were found in a YouTube video uploaded by the \u2018NTV Telugu\u2019 channel on 26t November 2019, i.e. before the Hyderabad incident. In the video, it can be found that the accused was being beaten by the police for allegedly raping a 10-year-old girl.\n\nAlso, \u2018The Hindu\u2019 has published an article on this incident with the title: \u2018Accused in rape case thrashed by cops, public in Chittoor\u201d.\n\nTo sum it up, the man thrashed by the police in the video is not the accused in the Hyderabad veterinary doctor rape-murder case. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
