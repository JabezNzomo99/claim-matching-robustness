Just thought you should know.\"\n\nThe post by Americans Against the Republican Party was shared and liked thousands of times, generating a ton of discussion. A reader asked us to weigh in.\n\nWe reached out to the group, linked to liberal site , but did not hear back. We also had no luck reaching spokespeople for Fox News or the prince.\n\nA trail of public records and flashy news stories helped fill in some of the blanks. Not all.\n\nPrince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud, 58, whose grandfather was the founding king of modern Saudi Arabia, is no stranger to the United States or Western media. He considers himself a \" \" of America and the \" .\"\n\u2022 Like, on a weekly basis to his palace rich;\n\u2022 First person in the world to order an Airbus A380, a double-decker jet for luxury vehicles, horses and a pivoting prayer space that always points to Mecca, rich.\n\nThe American-educated multibillionaire has made investments around the world, including many in Western entities such as CitiGroup, the George V hotel in Paris, the Plaza hotel in New York, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Apple, TimeWarner, Saks, Twitter (here\u2019s his ) and yes, News Corp.\n\nIn July 2013, Bloomberg rated him the in the world, with a net worth of $26.6 billion. Forbes ranked him earlier at $20 billion and followed up with about his wealth that infuriated Alwaleed, who threatened to sue for libel and said the magazine undervalued his net worth. Forbes defended its work.\n\nBest we can tell, the picture is of Prince Alwaleed.\n\nAlwaleed\u2019s interest in News Corp., the media conglomerate of Rupert Murdoch and once-parent company to Fox News, started in 1997 with a $400 million investment, according to a description of the investment on Alwaleed\u2019s . That was 3 percent of News Corp.\u2019s worth. In 2005, he increased his holding to 5.5 percent, the site states.\n\nThe picture is a little different now because News Corp. in June 2013 amid fallout from the company\u2019s phone-hacking controversy with its British newspapers.\n\nThe move spawned a new News Corp., housing publications such as the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Vogue. A second company, 21st Century Fox, oversees movies and TV programming, including the Fox News Channel.\n\nMurdoch is chairman of both companies and controls just under 80 percent of the voting stock in each (between himself and his family trust). Who\u2019s next in line? According to a with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, it\u2019s Alwaleed.\n\nAlwaleed owns 7 percent of Class B voting stock with 21st Century Fox, second only to Murdoch, as of Aug. 19. The filing notes, in compliance with federal securities law, 40 percent of Alwaleed\u2019s voting rights are suspended because he is not an American citizen.\n\nHe is the in the new News Corp., trailing Murdoch and an , with a 6.6 percent stake.\n\nThe relationship with Murdoch is reciprocal. News Corp. has a sizable stake in Rotana, a broadcasting company that airs Arabic and English programming in the Middle East. Alwaleed owns an 80 percent stake of Rotana, according to Bloomberg.\n\nSo Alwaleed has a sizable interest in Fox News, second in one aspect only to Murdoch. Experts told us that translates to being the No. 2 owner of Fox News.\n\nIt\u2019s accurate to say he\u2019s the No. 2 owner, but he\u2019s more of a passive major shareholder, said Jay Ritter, University of Florida finance professor, pointing out Alwaleed does not have a seat on the company\u2019s . His investment resembles other stocks held in major companies by mutual funds and investment firms, who invest big in public companies but do not intend to take over.\n\nWhat about the quote?\n\nIn many ways, the crux of this fact-check is whether Alwaleed said, \"A strong American Government is not good for us.\"\n\nWho the \"us\" is in the meme is not clear -- it could mean Fox News. Or it could mean Saudis or Muslims.\n\nWe searched for the quote in the meme in full and in part using Lexis Nexis and Google, with the assistance of a news researcher. It did not come up. A Google search of the full quote reveals few results, mainly linking to message boards or Facebook comments about the meme.\n\nThe closest thing to the supposed quote we found came from a June 2013 about U.S. shale-oil production. Alwaleed was quoted in a letter saying the rise in U.S. oil production would be a threat to Saudi Arabia. \"We see that rising North American shale gas production is an inevitable threat,\" he wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the meme wildly conflated those comments.\n\nBut even if so, the context is wildly misleading.\n\nInternet memes sometimes make us laugh. This one is frustrating.\n\nThe post is correct that Prince Alwaleed is the No. 2 owner of Fox News (technically, 21st Century Fox, the giant movie and TV corporation that owns the network). It\u2019s one of his many Western investments.\n\nBut we found no evidence the frequent guest of American media actually said, \"A strong American government is bad for us.\" We especially could not find it uttered under the context in which the meme may intend for you to understand it: that a strong American government is bad for Fox News.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
