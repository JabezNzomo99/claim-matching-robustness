The latest official statistics record just under 1.5 million kangaroos and wallabies killed commercially in 2017 across four Australian states (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia).\n\nCommercial killing doesn\u2019t take place in Tasmania, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory .\n\nThe 3.9 million figure referenced in the Facebook post could refer to the commercial quota in 2005, as publicised by animal rights charity PETA. In 2005 the number recorded as killed was lower than the quota\u20143.1 million.\n\nWe asked the Australian environment department and the Kangaroo Industries Association of Australia for more data but did not receive a response.\n\nThe post claims that Adidas is the largest user of kangaroo leather. We asked Adidas, Nike and Puma how much kangaroo leather they each use.\n\nAdidas confirmed they used kangaroo leather but did not tell us how much. Neither Nike nor Puma replied to our questions.\n\nThe Facebook post uses an image of a dead baby kangaroo. This photograph is not of a kangaroo that was killed for leather; it is of a baby kangaroo that died in bushfires in Victoria in 2009.", "lang": "en"}
