Nana Addo is tired. Those of us leading the fight are fatigued because we have done all that we could to defeat the virus but people are not adhering to the preventive protocols.\u201d\n\nThe Health Minister who doubles as the Member of Parliament for Dormaa Central Constituency said this at a ceremony to commission a newly built Police Station and a Community-based Health Planning and Service (CHPS) Compound in Dormaa Nsesreso.\n\nThe minister has since suggested he might have been lost in translation- walking back his earlier comments.\n\nIn a rejoinder published on Peacefmonline and aggregated by GhanaWeb, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu is quoted to have said:\n\n\u201cI only pleaded with Ghanaians on our normal COVID education awareness and I spoke about the hard work the President has put into this battle. The tireless efforts that the President and health officials have put into this fight require that we all help and adhere to the safety protocols. If we don\u2019t, [it] may put the President\u2019s labour in vain.\u201d\n\nThe claim that the minister made the original statement is true.\n\nBut to situate his comment in context considering the language barrier, the \u201ctired\u201d used here was to show frustration due to non-adherence of the COVID-19 protocol and not to suggest the government was giving up the fight against coronavirus outbreak.", "lang": "en"}
