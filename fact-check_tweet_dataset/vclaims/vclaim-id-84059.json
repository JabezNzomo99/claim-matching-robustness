Yogi Adityanath while referring to inter-religious marriages talks about how if \u2018they\u2019 take one Hindu girl, then we\u2019ll take away 100 Muslims girls. Trump mocks a reporter for his disability because the reporter is critical of him. Yogi Adityanath warns that if \u2018they\u2019 kill one Hindu, we won\u2019t file an FIR but will get 10 \u2018such people\u2019 murdered. Trump labels Mexicans as rapists and criminals while Yogi Adityanath labels Muslims as Jehadis. Now, how does one choose between these two forms of extreme bigotry? Well, apparently some people can and Rahul Kanwal, the managing editor of India Today, is one of those who has this unique ability to choose between these two forms of bigotry.\n\nLet us first look at Rahul Kanwal\u2019s views vis-a-vis Donald Trump as expressed via his tweets about the American President.\n\nSo, Rahul Kanwal thinks that it says a lot about \u2018US Politics\u2019 that a person like Trump is taken seriously. He\u2019s essentially trying to point out at the degradation in US politics because a person like Trump was taken seriously. These were his views before Trump was elected as the President. In the last month, after Trump officially took over the charge as the US President, many people of Indian origin in the United States have faced racial attacks. In one incident, an Indian citizen, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, was shot down after being asked to go back to India by an American military veteran. This happened in a bar in the state of Kansas. What does Rahul Kanwal think about that?\n\nHe thinks that the bigotry that Trump has brought with him is a dangerous landmine, an opinion influenced by the fact that his brother felt rattled because of his \u2018fancy beard\u2019. In fact, Rahul Kanwal\u2019s dislike for Donald Trump is such that he even recommends an application that will block anything related to Donald Trump.\n\nSo, if bigotry is a dangerous landmine as Rahul Kanwal claims in reference to Donald Trump, something which Yogi Aditynath has in abundance, you\u2019d think that Rahul Kanwal would have a problem with Yogi Adityanath becoming the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh? If bigotry is a landmine, and you\u2019re opposed to it because your brother is \u2018rattled\u2019 because of the consequences of that bigotry, surely you wouldn\u2019t want your fellow citizens to be a victim of such bigotry? So, what does Rahul Kanwal think about Yogi Adityanath?\n\nOops! Apparently, not. Rahul Kanwal thinks that Yogi Adityanath\u2019s version of bigotry deserves \u2018a chance\u2019. Rahul Kanwal thinks that a man who has given speeches in which he\u2019s warned that \u201cIf they kill one Hindu, we will kill 100 of theirs\u201d deserves a chance. Rahul Kanwal thinks that a man who thinks that inter-religious marriages are a case of Love-Jihad deserves a chance. Rahul Kanwal thinks that a man who offers Guns to Hindus in Dadri after the murder of Mohammad Akhlaq deserves a chance. Rahul Kanwal thinks that a man who demanded for the release of all the accused in the Dadri case deserves a chance. \u201cGive him a chance, See what he does. And judge him for his work as UP CM\u201d.\n\nIf only Rahul Kanwal\u2019s brother with his \u2018fancy beard\u2019 was in Mau district during the 2005 riots when Yogi Adityanath\u2019s Hindu Yuva Vahini reined terror, he probably would have used the adjective \u2018bigoted\u2019 at least once in reference to Yogi Adityanath.", "lang": "en"}
