The claim circulated as early as March and was still being viewed as of posting.\n\nThe facts: Experts and companies involved issued warnings against the mixture saying it could \"form a dangerous chemical that has toxic effects\" and \"may cause serious harm.\"\n\nThe country's Food and Drug Administration released guidelines on pharmacy compounding of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, which states that compounding shall only be conducted by registered and licensed pharmacists employed by licensed retail drug outlets.\n\nThe Integrated Chemists of the Philippines (ICP) addressed the claim that alcohol products like rum and vodka with bleach can be used as hand sanitizer, saying that these alcoholic products lack the concentration necessary for a hand sanitizer and that the hypochlorite in bleach can cause skin irritation and inflammation.\n\n\"Such products which are below the required 70% alcohol concentration should NOT BE USED as hand sanitizer. The preparation of hand sanitizers using bleach or hypochlorite should be done by trained professionals, such as chemists, pharmacists, chemical engineers, or medical technologists,\" ICP's statement read.\n\nMoreover, Green Cross Incorporated, the company that produces Zonrox, also released a statement on the claim, saying the solution is \"not acceptable\" as a disinfectant. \"Mixing bleach with ethyl alcohol (present in rum) will form a dangerous chemical that has toxic effects if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through skin,\" it said.\n\nTanduay Distillers, Inc. also posted an advisory against mixing Tanduay Rhum with bleach, hand sanitizer, or other chemicals. \"To be clear, this WILL NOT produce a viable disinfectant against the COVID-19 virus. On the contrary, this may cause serious harm, therefore should not be attempted,\" it said.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
