Eight of the chains contained information that was \u201ctop secret\u201d at the time they were sent. Thirty-six chains contained \u201csecret\u201d information. Eight contained \u201cconfidential\u201d information, the lowest classification.\n\nAnother 2,000 emails were \u201cup-classified,\u201d meaning those emails have reason to be classified now, even if they were not classified at the time they were sent. (We previously explored how \u201ctop secret\u201d emails ended up on her server.)\n\n\u201cSeparately, it is important to say something about the marking of classified information. Only a very small number of the emails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But even if information is not marked \u201cclassified\u201d in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.\u201d\n\nA Clinton campaign official sent the following comment: \u201cWe have not seen the emails the Director is referring to. We heard this for the first time when it was announced on TV, just like everyone else. The Secretary and campaign always have spoken to the best of our knowledge. And it was not just the campaign \u2013 but also the State Department, which also reviewed these emails \u2013 that had said none of these emails were marked classified. The bottom line is that career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate. And that there was no intent to do anything wrong. That is the main takeaway here.\u201d\n\n[Update, July 6, 2016: State Department spokesman John Kirby said the department was aware of two emails with a classification marking, and that they were marked classified by mistake. They were call sheets, bearing names of people the Secretary of State planned to call. Kirby said the call sheet markings \u201cwere a human error, they didn\u2019t need to be there.\u201d The process is for the secretary to decide to make the call, then change the markings to unclassified, Kirby said.\n\nKirby did not answer why the markings were still there, and said he did not know whether the FBI found more than two emails with such markings. The FBI did not respond to our request for information on whether there were other emails than the call lists with classification markings.\n\nUpdate, July 7, 2016: In a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Comey provided more details about the marked classified materials. When asked: \u201cSecretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her e-mails, either sent or received. Was that true?\u201d Comey answered: \u201cThat\u2019s not true. There were a small number of portion markings on, I think, three of the documents.\u201d\n\nThroughout the hearing, Comey explained that three emails contained \u201cportion markings where you\u2019re obligated, when something is classified, to put a marking on that paragraph.\u201d The emails bore the marking \u201c(C),\u201d indicating there was confidential classified information. It is possible that Clinton was not \u201ctechnically sophisticated\u201d enough to understood what the \u201c(C)\u201d meant, Comey said, but said a government official should be attentive to such a marking.]", "lang": "en"}
