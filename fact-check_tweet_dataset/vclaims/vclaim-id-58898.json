The actor is currently admitted in a Mumbai hospital for COVID-19.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found it to be fake.\n\nThe first red flag was that the font used in the circled part is different from all the other fonts in the video.\n\nThe main headline in the screenshot states the source, stating that Amitabh Bachchan is now fine. We scanned through all the reports by Aaj Tak that have been done on Amitabh Bachchan in recent days and found a video report with a similar headline.\n\nIn the above screenshot, we can see that the main headline and the report about WHO is visible. The report also features the same video of Amitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan as seen in the viral screenshot.\n\nHowever, the news about Big B\u2019s urination problem or similar parameters are not mentioned anywhere.\n\nBased on the above information, we can conclude that the post in circulation has been manipulated and is fake.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
