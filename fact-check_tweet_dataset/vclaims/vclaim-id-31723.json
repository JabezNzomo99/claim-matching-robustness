He never came home and the family left the bike there as a memorial to the fallen soldier.\"\n\nThis post, which includes a photo of a rusty red bike seemingly growing out of a tree, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIn 2009, the Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber, a local publication on Vashon, an island about 15 minutes away from Seattle, reported on a longtime family that \"laid a solid claim to the bicycle.\"\n\nDon Puz, who graduated from Vashon High School in 1963 and worked as a sheriff\u2019s deputy until he retired in 1991, said that the bike was donated to him after his family\u2019s home burned down, the Beachcomber says. It was too small for him and he claims that in 1954 he left it in the woods, forgot about it and never returned for it.\n\nHis mother told the publication that her son and his friends had been playing in the woods and that Puz was the only child to ride his bike there. When the boys left, he abandoned his bike and walked home with them.\n\nAfter the bike was discovered and drew media attention, Puz visited the bike, the Beachcomber says.\n\n\"We went down there in the woods and there was this bike in the tree, and I said, \u2018That\u2019s my bike,\u2019\" the Beachcomber quotes Puz as saying. \"I recognized it immediately. \u2026 When I saw that bike, I recognized it, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen another one like it.\"\n\nIn 2013, Seattle TV station KOMO News also talked to Puz who said he had no doubt the bike was his.\n\n\"It\u2019s a couple hundred feet from my mom\u2019s house where I used to play in the woods,\" he said.\n\nThe scene led Berkeley Breathed, who grew up on Vashon Island, to write a children\u2019s book called, \"Red Ranger Came Calling,\" Atlas Obscura reports. The story follows a boy living on an island who wants a Red Ranger bicycle.\n\nThe bicycle suspended feet above the ground also spurred the legend that a boy left the bike there before going to war.\n\n\"While it may be factually flawed, it shows that with its uncertainty, a simple but unusual thing like the Bike in the Tree can inspire fantasy and speculation,\" reads an essay on HistoryLink.org, a free online encyclopedia of Washington state history.\n\nStill, we rate this Facebook post False.", "lang": "en"}
