The caption read: \"An undertrial allegedly attacked and spit on a few members of the Mumbai police escort party on Saturday\".\n\nThis PTI article, published by NDTV on February 29, 2020, gives a more elaborate account of the incident behind the video. According to the article, a 26-year-old undertrial man named Mohammad Sohal Shaukat Ali spat on a cop and attacked some other police officers after he was denied home-cooked food brought by his family at a court in Mumbai.\n\nThane Police spokesperson Sukhada Narkar told PTI, \"Ali was taken to the court along with 11 other undertrials for a court hearing on Friday. After the hearing got over, one of Ali's relatives tried to give him home-cooked food outside the court. However, the escort party did not allow him to have it. Ali got annoyed over this and started abusing the policemen. When he was being taken to the jail in a police van, he started arguing with the members of the escort party. He spit on one policeman and manhandled another one. He also bit the finger of another policeman.\"\n\nThe incident happened on February 29, and has nothing to do with the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in India, as claimed by the viral posts.\n\nIn fact, the first few positive cases in Maharashtra were detected much later - on March 9, when a group of people traveling from Dubai to Mumbai and Pune tested positive after showing symptoms for COVID-19.", "lang": "en"}
