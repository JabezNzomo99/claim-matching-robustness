Several of his \u201cfacts,\u201d however, are inaccurate or misleading.\n\nContrary to the president\u2019s claims, the United States \u2014 not China \u2014 is responsible for having released more carbon pollution than any other nation. Trump also erred when he said that no Americans live in regions with air pollution above the World Health Organization\u2019s guideline level.\n\nThe president\u2019s counterprogramming arrived minutes after the first Democratic presidential candidate took the stage to talk about climate change. CNN dedicated seven hours to the event, which gave 10 of the top-polling candidates 40 minutes each to explain how they would approach the issue as president.\n\nIn his Twitter thread, Trump began with carbon emissions before moving on to some of his favorite topics, including energy production and clean air and water.\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s claims are things we\u2019ve heard before, so we\u2019ll review the repeats here and also explain a few of the new ones.\n\nOn carbon emissions. The president kicked off his list by touting America\u2019s progress on reducing pollution and claiming that China \u201chas dumped the most carbon into the air.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve explained before, since 2000, the United States did make the largest absolute reduction in emissions of any country. But large absolute reductions are only really possible in big countries full of people who pollute a lot per person.\n\nIn terms of a percent decline in emissions, many industrialized nations in Europe have bested America. Denmark slashed its emissions by 34% between 2000 and 2016, while France scored a 20% cut, and the United Kingdom made a 29% cut. In comparison, the U.S. managed only a 14% decline over the same period, and remains the second highest overall polluter and the 10th highest per capita polluter.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that China \u201chas dumped the most carbon into the air\u201d is false. China is currently the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, but historically, the United States has dumped more carbon into the atmosphere. According to the Global Carbon project, the U.S. has released 399 billion tons of carbon dioxide between 1751 and 2017, more than any other nation on Earth. China is second, with 200 billion tons. The U.S. accounts for 25% of global cumulative emissions, while China\u2019s share is 13%.\n\nInternational Energy Agency data for 2016 also show that China is not one of the biggest per capita polluters. It comes in at number 39 \u2014 29 spots after the U.S.\n\nFor more, see: \u201cTrump Twists Facts in Environmental Speech,\u201d Nov 28, 2018\n\nOn air pollution. The president\u2019s third fact was that 91% of the world\u2019s population is \u201cexposed to air pollution above the World Health Organization\u2019s suggested level.\u201d This is true. The WHO features the statistic on its website, and a nearly identical 90% appeared in a press release when the group announced updates to its ambient air quality database in 2018. But Trump went on to say that \u201cNONE ARE IN THE U.S.A.!\u201d That\u2019s false.\n\nWhile most Americans aren\u2019t exposed to air pollution above the WHO\u2019s guidelines, some are. According to a fact sheet prepared by the University of Chicago\u2019s Energy Policy Institute, as of 2016, about 15% of the country lives in a county that fails to meet the WHO\u2019s standards on particulate pollution. The sheet notes that Fresno, California, for example, has pollution levels that are twice the recommended level, and other places in California and the Midwest are also above the guideline level.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s interactive map of air pollution also refutes the president\u2019s categorical claim. While much of the country appears green, indicating the area meets the standard for the smallest and most dangerous form of particulate pollution known as PM2.5, there are patches of the nation that are yellow or orange and exceed those limits. Those places include multiple locales in California, an area outside of Chicago and scattered spots across the Midwest. Readings from individual cities such as Bakersfield, Houston and Steubenville, Ohio, also show places above the 10 micrograms per cubic meter guideline for PM2.5 and the 20 microgram per cubic meter guideline for PM10.\n\nOverall, the WHO data make the case that there is much less air pollution in the United States than in most of the world. But Trump is wrong to say that no Americans suffer from air pollution levels above the WHO guideline.\n\nOn energy production. Trump also claimed, as he has before, that the U.S. \u201cnow leads the world in energy production.\u201d\n\nThe United States, however, is not the top energy producer, at least according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The most recent global figures from the EIA put the U.S. behind China in 2016 when counting total primary energy, or the total of all fossil fuels, nuclear power and renewables.\n\nUnder Trump, energy production has expanded, but not to a degree that eclipses China\u2019s production in 2016. The U.S. produced 96 quadrillion Btus in 2018, which did not exceed China\u2019s 2016 total of 107 quadrillion Btus.\n\nThe U.S. has become the largest producer of crude oil \u2014 a threshold the nation crossed last summer, although the title was long expected. The U.S. was already No. 1 for natural gas and petroleum production before Trump took office.\n\nFor more, see: \u201cTrump\u2019s Campaign Kickoff Claims,\u201d June 19 and \u201cFactChecking Trump\u2019s Energy Boasts,\u201d June 8, 2018\n\nOn clean air and water. The president twice referenced clean air and water in his list of purported facts, first claiming America has the \u201ccleanest and safest air and water\u201d and later implying that he is responsible for the accomplishment.\n\nThis is one of Trump\u2019s favorite environmental subjects, but by several metrics, the U.S. does not rank first in the world. And there is little evidence to suggest the administration has made air or water quality better.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written previously, the 2018 Environmental Performance Index positions the U.S. 10th overall for best air quality and 29th for water and sanitation. On drinking water, America is ranked No. 1 along with nine other nations. But on water resources, or a measure of effective wastewater management, the U.S. comes in at No. 39, and on air pollution, a middling 83rd.\n\nBefore ending his Twitter thread, Trump indicated he should be given credit for the nation\u2019s air and water quality. \u201cI want crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet \u2013 we\u2019ve now got that!\u201d he said, listing the sentence as his eighth fact.\n\nBut the U.S.\u2019s only top ranking for drinking water predates Trump. As we\u2019ve said, the ranking used 2016 data, and therefore does not reflect any change under Trump.\n\nData from the Environmental Protection Agency also do not document any meaningful improvement on air quality under Trump. Some air quality trends have gotten better between 2016 and 2018, according to the EPA\u2019s latest report. But others, including concentrations of two kinds of particulate matter and the number of days with unhealthy levels of air pollutants for sensitive groups, have worsened.\n\nFor more, see: \u201cTrump Twists Facts in Environmental Speech,\u201d July 10, \u201cTrump Bungles Climate Change in UK,\u201d June 7 and \u201cU.S. Not Ranked the \u2018Cleanest\u2019 Country,\u201d Aug. 23, 2018", "lang": "en"}
