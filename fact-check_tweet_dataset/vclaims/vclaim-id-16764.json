Mr Nuttall had suggested that 51% aren\u2019t clinically qualified, which is presumably mixing the figures up. But his basic point is correct: about half of NHS staff have a clinical qualification, the other half don\u2019t.\n\nThis includes doctors and nurses working in GP surgeries as well as those working in hospitals and community health services.\n\nJust over 1.3 million people work in these areas, including almost 685,000 who are clinical staff. Roles that require clinical qualifications include doctors, nurses, midwives, ambulance staff and various other scientific and technical staff like pharmacists, therapists and lab assistants.\n\nNHS workers who aren\u2019t clinically qualified can include support staff, some managers and other staff such as those working as receptionists or in personnel.\n\nYou can also calculate the number of full-time jobs filled by people. By this count, 53% of NHS staff are clinically qualified. There are just over 1.15 million full time NHS roles, so this means around 610,000 are held by clinically qualified staff.\n\nBut these figures do come with a health warning. NHS Digital, which publishes them, says that they are still experimental statistics because of recent changes in the way data is collected and reported.", "lang": "en"}
