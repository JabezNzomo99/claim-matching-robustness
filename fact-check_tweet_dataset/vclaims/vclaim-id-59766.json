I don\u2019t really care as long as they\u2019re here to vote so I have to say \u2018be a patriot,\u2019 that\u2019s motivating these animals, okay? The people I call \u2018The Hills Have Eyes\u2019 people. If I say \u2018health,\u2019 how do you get somebody to be healthy when they\u2019re balls deep in their sister, shooting Mountain Dew in their veins and snorting opioids while watching \u2018Tiger King\u2019 for the 45th time?\"\n\nA banner beneath the video says: \"Trump off the record\" and gives a link to the website of Project Veritas, a conservative group known for going undercover with hidden cameras to record Democratic politicians and liberal groups, among others, and then posting often misleadingly-edited videos online.\n\n\"What a deplorable man,\" reads one tweet that shared the video. \"Truly.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe video doesn\u2019t appear on the Project Veritas website. Rather, it was first tweeted by a parody Twitter account called Parodia News Network, and from there it seems it took on a life of its own as social media users started sharing it without the caveat that this isn\u2019t real.\n\nThough the voice in the video sounds like the president, comedian J-L Cauvin \u2014 a talented Trump impersonator \u2014 has claimed credit.\n\nThe footage that appears in the video was posted on July 27, unedited, by a CBS affiliate. Trump says little, listening instead, as he tours the FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies Innovation Center in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nBut the video that\u2019s being shared on social media is fake, and claims that it\u2019s real are wrong.
