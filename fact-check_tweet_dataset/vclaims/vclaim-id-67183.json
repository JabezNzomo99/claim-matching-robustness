Citing the FBI, FactCheck.org said: \u201cThe number of violent crimes per 100,000 population was nearly 16 percent lower in 2016 than in 2008, and the property crime rate dropped nearly 24 percent. But the murder rate didn\u2019t drop at all \u2014 it was 5.4 per 100,000 both in 2008 and in 2016.\u201d\n\nAs for the stats so far in 2020, the campaign cited calculations by crime analyst Jeff Asher, who compared the non-population-adjusted data for the 25 biggest cities for the first seven months of the year with the first seven months of 2019. The number of murders went up 26 percent, but the number of violent crimes is essentially flat.\n\nThere\u2019s the separate problem of comparing eight years of data with just seven months. It\u2019s a trick that Trump should be familiar with. During the 2016 campaign, Trump seized on FBI data showing homicides were up 10.8 percent nationwide in 2015, which was the biggest percentage jump in a single year since 1971.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time, such as month over month or year over year,\u201d we noted at the time. \u201cAn annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still does not give a full picture. Many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years, preferably 10 or 20 years, of data.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis would be an unprecedented trend as far as crime trends go,\u201d he said. \u201cViolent crime and murder almost always move in the same direction and they are never this far apart nationally.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s far too early to understand why this might be happening. Perhaps crimes other than murder are not being reported as quickly. Perhaps the pandemic messed up the crime statistics in ways that are not yet clear. In any case, it underscores why at this moment this is not good data to use for comparisons.\n\nIt would have been more appropriate for Biden to have used Trump\u2019s record so far in his term, not just a seven-month sliver. The data is incomplete for 2019, but for the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency, both the violent crime rate and the murder rate fell, according to the FBI.\n\n\u201cHe made two distinct points, and he made the different categories clear,\u201d a Biden campaign official said. \u201cFirst, in order to refute Trump\u2019s false accusations regarding his own record and that of Democratic mayors, he cited that during the Obama-Biden administration, when many of the same major cities had Democratic mayors, violent crime rates fell. Then, as one of a series of numbers he gave about safety under Trump (including about coronavirus deaths), he underlined rising murder rates in large cities, which falls under a similar time frame and contradicts Trump\u2019s depiction of his own record on safety.\u201d\n\nWe doubt it is a coincidence that Biden chose data that reflected best on his record. Biden could have said that the murder rate did not improve under Obama and murders have jumped in the last seven months. Or he could have said violent crime fell under Obama but little has improved this year. At least then the data would have been consistent, even if the timelines did not match up.", "lang": "en"}
