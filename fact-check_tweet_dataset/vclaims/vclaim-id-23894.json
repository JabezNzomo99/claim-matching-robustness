The next day, Mahathir Mohamad again claimed that the case was political, and that investigators were blaming Russia from the beginning without examination.\n\nOn July 17, the day of the fifth MH17 anniversary, the United States and the European Union called on Russia to \u201caccept its responsibility and cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nThe EU expressed \u201cfull confidence in the independence and professionalism of the legal procedures.\u201d\n\nLeonid Slutsky, head of the Russian State Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee, called the EU plea to Russia an example of \u201cuncommon cynicism and political bias.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Washington, George Kent, deputy assistant secretary in the U.S. State Department's Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, said \"Russia set the stage for the shoot-down of MH17 by financing, organizing, and leading proxies in eastern Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Russian government has consistently denied the allegations and put forward numerous \u201calternative theories\u201d of how the events leading up to the disaster unfolded. All of Russia\u2019s \u201cversions\u201d have been thoroughly checked and debunked, including by Polygraph.info.\n\nThe Malaysian prime minister\u2019s comment of June 20, that people were blaming Russia for the incident even before examining the evidence, bears special attention.\n\nIt is true that fingers were pointed at Russia shortly after the crash, but for a very good reason. In the days leading up to the incident, Russian proxy forces in Ukraine had shot down a number of Ukrainian aircraft, including seven Ukrainian military airplanes. In fact, immediately after the crash of MH17, Russian state media, citing a pro-Russian controlled rebel source, reported that a Ukrainian Air Force An-26 cargo plane had been shot down. That plane was later discovered to be MH17, but the original story is still posted on the website of the state-owned media outlet TASS. In any case, the Ukrainian military was fighting an opponent not known to have air support and would have had little reason to fire on a high-altitude flight flying west-to-east, as MH17 was at the time.\n\nThe Russian side almost immediately accused the Ukrainians of shooting down the plane. One early claim was that the Ukrainian military mistook MH17 for Putin\u2019s plane, which was returning to Russia around that time. Shortly thereafter, a fake Twitter account belonging to a self-proclaimed Spanish air traffic controller working at Kyiv\u2019s Boryspil International Airport tweeted that a Ukrainian military plane was in the vicinity of MH17. Since then, Russian narratives of the event have alternatively blamed either a Ukrainian Air Force plane (usually a Su-25 ground attack aircraft) or a Ukrainian-fired Buk surface-to-air missile. Many of these claims were made well before any investigation was carried out.\n\nIt would also be false to suggest that investigators did not consider other explanations for the downing of the Malaysian airliner. For example, the Dutch Safety Board investigation, which released its report in 2015, even considered the possibility that a meteorite or \u201cspace debris\u201d struck the plane.\n\n\n\n Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. The plane was flying from Amsterdam to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. The entire crew and 43 of its passengers were Malaysian citizens.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin in 2003.", "lang": "en"}
