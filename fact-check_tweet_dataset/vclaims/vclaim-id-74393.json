But the claim is false: the image features Ethiopian actress, Hanan Tarik.\n\nThe photo, which was posted in this Facebook group on July 29, 2020, shows a woman in an office with the Ethiopian flag in the background. \u201cSudanese people will now pour all the water they have in their fridges into the dam for the new Ethiopian ambassador to Sudan,\u201d reads the English translation of the Arabic caption.\n\nThe claim appears to make a tongue-in-cheek reference to the controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.\n\nThe dam on the Blue Nile has been a source of tension between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan, as AFP has extensively reported including here.\n\nEthiopia's downstream neighbours worry the dam will restrict vital water supplies. They are especially concerned about what might happen should there be a drought while Ethiopia is still filling the reservoir, a process that will take several years.\n\nThe false Facebook claim was also shared here, here, here and here, referencing the woman's looks and the Nile.\n\n\u201cFeel free to take the whole Nile,\u201d read one comment. \u201cTake our water, we don\u2019t want to drink,\u201d said another. Others said that it was a \u201cgreat thing to have young officials, better than the older ones in our government\u201d.\n\nBut the claim is false. In reality, the photo shows Ethiopian actress and former beauty queen Hanan Tarik.\n\nA reverse image search led to an Instagram post on Hanan\u2019s official account explaining that she had signed a deal to promote a cosmetics brand.\n\n\u201cToday I'm honored to announce that I have signed with NHY to be the brand ambassador for one of the leading import and export companies in Ethiopia to represent internationally recognized brands like M.A.C. Cosmetics and DIAGEO\u201d wrote Tarik.\n\nThe current Ethiopian ambassador to Sudan is Yibeltal Aemero who assumed diplomatic duties in Khartoum on July 23, 2020.\n\nThe embassy shared a post about his appointment on its official Facebook page.", "lang": "en"}
