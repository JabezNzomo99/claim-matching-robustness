Several Facebook posts accusing SRK to be a \u2018deshdrohi\u2019 also features in the video.\n\nNot only is the video viral now after having resurfaced with a fresh set of accusations against Khan, but also posts which brand King Khan as a \u2018deshdrohi\u2019 for allegedly having contributed to Pakistan\u2019s grieving times are doing the rounds.\n\nBOOM accessed the original video of India TV\u2019s show Aaj Ka Viral, that aired the segment on July 4, 2017, debunking the message. Starting from 1.42 minute mark, to 2.40 minute, the background of the viral message is being talked about in the show. The show then goes on to establish the fact that Shah Rukh Khan did not contribute to families of the victims of the oil tanker blasts of 2017 in Pakistan, which killed almost 200 people.\n\nThe Bahawalpur oil tanker blasts in Pakistan, in 2017, resulted in the death of more than 190 people. The oil tanker had overturned on a highway between Karachi and Lahore, while carrying 40,000 litres of fuel.\n\nBOOM reached out to India TV's Editor-in-Chief and Chairman Rajat Sharma. He said, \"We checked and found that this report is baseless. Shah Rukh never supported Pakistan.\"\n\nIndia TV had also reported that during the Chennai floods of 2015, Khan had donated Rs 1 crore. The news channel further reported that in 2014, his company Red Chillies Entertainment contributed to a few social and rural development schemes of the Government of India, and several other contributions were made by Khan for the development of the nation.\n\nIn fact, in an email to India TV, Khan\u2019s team denied having made any contributions to the victims of the Pakistan tanker blast.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter was taken up by storm on Monday night with several users urging social media outlets to stop spreading rumours about Shah Rukh Khan, with the hashtag - #StopFakeNewsAgainstSRK.\n\nBOOM has reached out to the actor for a comment. The story will be updated if we receive a reply.", "lang": "en"}
