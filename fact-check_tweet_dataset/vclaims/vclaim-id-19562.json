I must warn you, remember your army shall have to paid tremendous price once we can cross the #LOC any time you should\"\n\nUsing InVid, a video verification tool, we broke the video into key frames and performed a reverse image search and found a similar video which was uploaded on November 1, 2017 stating that it was a mock drill by Jharkhand's Khunti Police.\n\nAdditionally, the search results showed that the same video was previously viral with the false claim that it showed Madhya Pradesh police firing at farmers in Mandsaur. This claim was debunked by Alt News on July 11, 2018.\n\nIn this second video titled 'Jharkhand police KHUNTI (part of traning) REHEARSAL' uploaded on November 4, 2017, one can view the training exercise from a different angle. The video also shows the protesters chanting slogans.\n\nOn observing the video, one can confirm that it is a mock drill as people can be spotted recording the event on their mobile phones.\n\nAt the 0.50 timestamp one can also spot people walking past as the police is charging towards the protesters.\n\nAfter shots are fired by the police at the 16 seconds timestamp, no blood spill or shot wounds can be spotted as the police put a protester on a stretcher.\n\nSignboards of shops in the background can be spotted in Hindi, whereas shops in Kashmir mostly have signboards in Urdu.\n\nAdditionally in the viral video, one can spot 'Allahabad bank' at the seven seconds mark. Using Google Maps, we could locate the street on which the bank branch lies in Khunti, Jharkhand.", "lang": "en"}
