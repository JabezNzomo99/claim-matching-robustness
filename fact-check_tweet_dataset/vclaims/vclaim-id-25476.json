Mani Ratnam's aide confirmed that the filmmaker signed the letter and any claims that his signature was forged are baseless.\n\nRatnam is among the 49 celebrities who signed a letter addressed to Modi, raising concerns about the recent cases of lynchings in the country and demanded strict action. Other signatories include Aparna Sen, Anurag Kashyap, Shyam Benegal, Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Ramchandra Guha, among others.\n\nMultiple mainstream news outlets cited unverified sources to claim that Ratnam denied signing any such letter and that his signature was forged.\n\nBOOM spoke to Siva Ananth, Ratnam\u2019s aide, who confirmed the latter\u2019s participation in signing the open letter to Modi. He said, \u201cMani Ratnam did sign the letter. Though he doesn\u2019t want to elaborate about his solidarity with the cause, there is \u2018cent percent\u2019 truth about his signature.\u201d\n\nAn article, published by Aaj Tak on July 24, quoted Ratnam\u2019s team as saying, \u201cIn fact famous filmmaker Mani Ratnam's team has rubbished reports which suggest that even Mani Ratnam has signed the letter. According to the team, Mani Ratnam is busy with the pre production of his forthcoming film. Neither has he signed any such letter nor has he been asked to lend support to any such cause.\u201d\n\nThe article then goes on to mention how Mani Ratnam\u2019s denial could stir up a controversy about this letter, that has been signed by the liberals of the country.\n\nBOOM reached out to Siva Ananth to know if Ratnam has a separate team handling his media interactions. Anant said, \u201cWe speak to press only about our films through our PRO. We don\u2019t speak otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe same was corroborated by scribes who reached out to Ratnam's office to clarify.\n\nRight wing propaganda website Swarajya published an article based on a report by News18, that had in turn credited the news to the above Aaj Tak story.\n\nInterestingly, another right wing propaganda website OpIndia had earlier published the same article with the headline, 'Mani Ratnam denies signing the letter sent to PM Modi peddling the fake narrative of increased hate crime.' It deleted the same later. BOOM was able to access an archive of the article.\n\nIn fact, verified Twitter users also fell for the same piece of fake news.\n\nALSO READ: No Reason Strong Enough To Leave India: Javed Akhtar On Fake Quote\n\nShabana Azmi Calls Out Fake Communal Quote Regarding Navratri", "lang": "en"}
