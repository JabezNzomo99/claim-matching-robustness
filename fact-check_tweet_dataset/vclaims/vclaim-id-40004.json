The word \"tariff\" is misspelled.)\n\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe image has been altered and its message is inaccurate. Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand is no longer operating, although her company received preliminary approval from the Chinese government for five trademarks in Jan. 2019, which some say could help her resume her business after Trump leaves office.\n\nAfter running a reverse-image search, we found that the image of the box has been cropped from a larger photo published by Gawker in March 2016.\n\nThe original photo does include the \"made in China\" stamp, but the misspelled \"tariff exempt\" imprint seen in the Facebook post\u2019s version is not there.\n\nWhile her father\u2019s latest round of tariffs on Chinese goods largely targets electronics, Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand likely would be affected if it were still in operation because the items to be taxed also include many types of footwear.\n\nAn image posted on Facebook claims to show a box of Ivanka Trump brand shoes made in China with a tariff exempt stamp.\n\nThe image is old, Ivanka\u2019s fashion line is now defunct, and the photo was manipulated to include the misspelled stamp.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
