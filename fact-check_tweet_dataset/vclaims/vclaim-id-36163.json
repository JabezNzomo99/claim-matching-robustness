It\u2019s already been proven that his birth certificate is a phony. Q has even said that he will claim Kenyan citizenship to keep from being charged for treason. Now, if he claims Kenyan citizenship, that means he was a false president, in which case every decision this man has made is now null and void, including the two Supreme Court justices!\n\nEverything stated in that brief article was incorrect:\n\u2022 Obama\u2019s birth certificate has not been proved \u201cphony.\u201d In fact, it has been verified by the original issuing authority, the Hawaii Department of Health, and that certificate \u2014 along with considerable other evidence \u2014 documents that Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and thus is a native-born citizen of the U.S.\n\u2022 Even if Barack Obama were not a native-born citizen of the U.S., and thus was ineligible to hold the office of president of the U.S., no provision in U.S. law exists for retroactively invalidating the actions of a president who improperly attained office.\n\u2022 No credible information supports the notion that Obama undertook any particular actions for which he is about to be, or even could be, \u201ctried for treason.\u201d Article 3, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution very narrowly defines the crime of treason: \u201cTreason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\u201d As University of California Davis law Professor Carlton F.W. Larson noted in an article on the subject, under that definition, \u201cSpeaking against the government, undermining political opponents, supporting harmful policies or even placing the interests of another nation ahead of those of the United States are not acts of treason under the Constitution.\u201d\n\u2022 Even if Obama were (about) to be tried for treason and had in fact been born in Kenya (neither of which appears remotely true), his simply claiming Kenyan citizenship at this juncture would not necessarily protect him from the consequences. As Larson noted, the notion that only U.S. citizens can commit treason against the U.S. is a myth: \u201c[T]he offense of treason can be committed by any person who owes allegiance to the United States, and this can include noncitizens. Treason law recognizes two kinds of allegiance: permanent and temporary. U.S. citizens owe permanent allegiance to the United States, and this duty carries with them wherever they go in the world. By contrast, noncitizens in the United States (other than ambassadors and their staffs) owe a duty of temporary allegiance, the Supreme Court found in an 1872 case. While they are within the United States and receiving protection from it, noncitizens are governed by American treason law. If a person on a green card or a student or tourist visa, for example, wages war against the United States or provides aid and comfort to our enemies, he cannot escape a treason prosecution simply by asserting his foreign citizenship.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the End of the Age Headlines article was cribbed from a piece published by the Right Wing Watch website, which revealed that the \u201cObama Will Claim Kenyan Citizenship to Keep from Being Tried for Treason\u201d rumor was based on nothing more than wild and unsupported speculation delivered in a YouTube video by a \u201cradical right-wing conspiracy theorist\u201d:\n\nDuring his recent appearance on Tiffany FitzHenry\u2019s YouTube program, radical right-wing conspiracy theorist and so-called \u201cfirefighter prophet\u201d Mark Taylor claimed that Barack Obama will soon admit to having been born in Kenya in an attempt to avoid being prosecuted for treason. \u201cI don\u2019t think the guy is American,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s already been proven that that birth certificate is a phony.\u201d Taylor insisted that the issue of Obama\u2019s birth certificate is vitally important because it is the key to effectively negating his entire presidency, citing the QAnon conspiracy theory which claims that high-ranking intelligence officials in the Trump administration are leaking information about a secret plan to take down a global network of satanic pedophiles that includes prominent Democratic Party entertainment, political and business figures.", "lang": "en"}
