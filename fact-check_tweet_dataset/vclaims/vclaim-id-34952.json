While the accompanying text is written in a sarcastic tone, a large number of users are sharing the photo believing it to be true. Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.\n\n\n\nThe photo has been shared more than 10,000 times at the time of writing this article. By looking at the comments, it can be ascertained that the users are believing the photo to be true.\n\nFact: It is a photoshopped image. In the original photo, it can be seen that the bull has only one head. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo of the bull is cropped and run through the Google Reverse Image Search, a similar photo was found in a blog. In the photo, it can be seen that the bull has only one head. The head has been copied and mirrored in the edited photo to show that the bull has two heads. So, the two-headed bull in the photo is not real; it is a photoshopped image. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, the two-headed Nandi (bull) in the photo is not real. It is a photoshopped image. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
