Their tweet slammed it as 'false propaganda' to destabilize the company.The fake notification published on a fake letterhead announcing the shutdown and asking employees to look for other jobs, surfaced when the airline is already facing a huge debt crisis. Several reports have pointed out that the airline has accumulated debt of around Rs 48,000 crore.
