The image is actually of donations made to poor and homeless people in February 2017 by a charity based in Lagos. There is no evidence that Abubakar\u2019s campaign distributed food packages with money during the rally.\n\nOn December 3, Abubakar and his Peoples Democratic Party held the rally in Sokoto state, northwest Nigeria, ahead of elections in February 2019 where he is expected to be the main challenger to Buhari and his All Progressives Congress party.\n\nNorthwest Nigeria is a key base of support for Buhari, who was born in neighbouring Katsina State.\n\nOn December 4, the president\u2019s aide, Lauretta Onochie, tweeted an image referring to the rally with the message, \u201cKeep them in poverty, then give them handouts - Atiku in Sokoto yesterday\u201d.\n\nThe post was retweeted more than 280 times on Twitter. A similar post from an unverified Facebook account in her name was shared more than 100 times.\n\nA Facebook user, Zara Gift Onyinye, also posted the same picture with the message, \"This is how it happened in Sokoto today...Shameless to say the least\". The post was shared more than 2,300 times.\n\nUsing a reverse image search, the earliest use of the photo found by AFP was in an article by Naijagists.com on February 20, 2017.\n\nOn February 21, 2017, the image was also published by the website Kemifilani.com, showing a Nollywood actress donating packages to poor communities in Lagos on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nAbubakar is a wealthy businessman and a former vice-president. Since he was announced as candidate for the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party in presidential elections in February 2019 numerous social media accounts have released false information regarding his wealth.\n\nIn October, Abubakar released a statement distancing himself from an online grant scheme posted by accounts purporting to represent his campaign, which promised users money in exchange for political campaigning.\n\nAFP fact-checked Onochie\u2019s claims in conjunction with CrossCheck Nigeria, a community of journalists fact-checking misinformation.", "lang": "en"}
