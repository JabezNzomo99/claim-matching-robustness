Rather, the tweets were inspired by a comment made by White House press secretary Josh Earnest on 8 December 2015:\n\nNow, I know that each of the Republican candidates has already taken an oath pledging to support Donald Trump for president of the United States if he wins the nomination. But the fact is, the first thing a president does when he or she takes the oath of office is to swear an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. And the fact is, what Donald Trump said yesterday disqualifies him from serving as president.\n\nWhile Earnest did say that Trump\u2019s comment \u201cdisqualifies him\u201d from serving as president, this does not reflect any legal statutes which could prevent Trump from continuing his campaign. Instead, Earnest\u2019s comment could be more accurately interpreted as meaning that Donald Trump is not \u201cmorally fit\u201d to serve as president.\n\nEarnest\u2019s comment came a day after Trump proposed that all Muslims should be temporarily banned from entering the United States, a position the Republican candidate defended during an appearance on CNN:\n\nWhile several politicians, including Republicans, Democrats, and international leaders, have condemned Trump for his suggestion that Muslims be banned from entering the United States (while others defended the proposal), nothing about his pronouncements literally disqualifies him from running for president.\n\nIt should also be noted that Earnest\u2019s \u201cdisqualifying comment\u201d was largely aimed at Republican leaders in an attempt to show how Trump was hurting their party. While Trump hasn\u2019t specifically replied to Earnest\u2019s comment, he has hinted at the possibility of running as a third-party candidate:", "lang": "en"}
