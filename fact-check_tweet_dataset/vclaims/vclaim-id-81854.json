Tim Kaine said he doesn\u2019t have their backs.\n\nKaine, Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential pick, blasted Trump on MSNBC for his \"not a war hero\" comments about John McCain, his delay in donating to veterans charities, and his ideas for fixing the Veterans Administration.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization of the V.A.,\" Kaine said July 11. \"That is something that is overwhelmingly rejected by America's veterans. They do not want to go down that path. Do they want improvement? Sure they do. But they don't want risky or radical.\"\n\nTo back up his claim, the Kaine camp pointed to Trump\u2019s campaign page on V.A. reforms and articles suggesting privatization is among them. But the Trump campaign told us Trump\u2019s plan simply gives veterans a choice, and that\u2019s not the same thing as privatization.\n\nWhile Trump wants to give veterans access to health providers outside the V.A. system, Kaine is being overly simplistic by suggesting Trump wants to turn over the whole thing to the private sector.\n\nTrump\u2019s VA plans include some elements of privatization, but it isn\u2019t an outright overhaul of the existing system.\n\nAt an October 2015 rally in Virginia, Trump said even though some candidates want to get rid of the V.A. (possibly referring to Ben Carson\u2019s proposals to give veterans health savings accounts) he wants to \"supplement\" the existing V.A. system for veterans.\n\n\"No, it doesn\u2019t have to be privatization,\" Trump said at a May 2016 press conference. \"What it has to be is when somebody is online and they say it\u2019s a seven-day wait, that person\u2019s going to walk across the street to a private doctor, be taken care of, we\u2019re gonna pay the bill.\"\n\nNowhere on his position page or in his July 2016 Virginia Beach speech on veterans issues does Trump propose privatizing the V.A. Instead, he seeks to modernize it, crack down on inefficiency and abuse, and provide more care for female vets and those in in rural areas.\n\nHe does, however, propose a veterans ID card for use outside of the V.A. system on his campaign website:\n\n\"Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran\u2019s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately. ...The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans\u2019 health care dollars.\"\n\nSimilarly, Trump floated the idea in his speech in Virginia: \"We are going to ensure every veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the V.A., or to seek private medical care paid for by our government.\"\n\nAccording to the Trump campaign, this is essentially the recommendation of the bipartisan federal Commission on Care, but with more choice in doctors.\n\nBut veterans groups (many of which support the commission\u2019s recommendations) told us that\u2019s not an entirely accurate comparison. In short, the commission plan folds private health care providers into the V.A. system, while the Trump plan allows veterans to opt out of it.\n\nIn its 300-page report, the commission emphasized that the V.A. should have oversight over an integrated health care network by vetting, training and coordinating with private sector doctors and clinics that qualify for participation.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan, again, gives veterans access to all Medicare providers, but it doesn\u2019t specify that these non-V.A. doctors would have to coordinate or meet the standards of the V.A.\n\nThe I.D. card proposal also bears some resemblance to the Veterans Choice program, a law sponsored by John McCain that gives veterans access to community providers if they\u2019ve been waiting for more than 30 days for V.A. care or if they live more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility. Trump\u2019s plan would essentially get rid of these eligibility requirements.\n\nTrump advisor Sam Clovis did tell the Wall Street Journal the candidate might model V.A. care after Medicare (like an insurance provider), as the Kaine campaign pointed out, but Clovis also said Trump \"doesn\u2019t want to take away the veterans hospitals and the things that are working out.\"\n\nVeterans group agreed that Trump\u2019s I.D. card plan would lead to more privatized care, but were divided on whether Kaine\u2019s characterization of Trump\u2019s plan was accurate.\n\nParalyzed Veterans of America\u2019s executive director Sherman Gillums Jr. criticized Trump\u2019s proposal for \"completely privatizing\" the V.A. in a press release, but praised Trump\u2019s attention to veterans issues.\n\nAMVETS spokesman John Hoellwarth called the proposal \"well-intentioned,\" but agreed that it was privatization and would be disastrous.\n\n\"Encouraging all veterans to seek care in the private sector, which lacks the expertise to treat military and combat injuries and illnesses, and which does not typically provide integrated or coordinated care, would lead to worse health outcomes for many veterans,\" Hoellwarth said.\n\nVeterans of Foreign Wars, meanwhile, considers the Trump\u2019s idea partial privatization.\n\n\"Our concern is that a \u2018go anywhere card\u2019 leads to veterans receiving fragmented, uncoordinated, and lower-quality care, which is not what veterans have earned and deserve,\" said Joe Davis, the group\u2019s director of public affairs. \"Private sector health care must complement, not compete with or supplant the VA health care system.\"\n\nOn the other end, Dan Caldwell, vice president for political and legislative action at Concerned Veterans for America (which is backed by the anti-Trump Koch brothers) said the group supports both choice and integration and disagreed vehemently with Kaine\u2019s characterization.\n\n\"Giving veterans the choice of where to use their VA benefits does not necessitate the sale of VA hospitals to corporations nor does it eliminate government control of veterans\u2019 health care,\" Caldwell said. \"Calling expanded health care choice for veterans \u2018privatization\u2019 is simply a poll-tested scare tactic.\"\n\nKaine said, \"Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization of the V.A.\"\n\nActually, Trump is a guy who has called for giving veterans access to private providers. That may lead some veterans to seek care outside the V.A., but it\u2019s not the same thing as completely privatizing the system.", "lang": "en"}
