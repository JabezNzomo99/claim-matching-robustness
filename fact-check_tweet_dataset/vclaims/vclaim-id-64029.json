Moreover, the colour of his clothing and the position of his (PM Modi) stole is also the same, hence we can establish that the picture on the right was used to create the morphed picture of PM Modi.\n\nWith the above fact check, we can conclude that the picture in question is FAKE.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
