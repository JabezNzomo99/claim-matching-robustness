You talked about the standards of any ultimate deal. Is enrichment of any kind by Iran, is that something everybody should stay focused on? That any deal that includes that is a non-starter for you, because, of course, the Iranians say that they expect to be able to keep enriching?\n\nSEN. BOB CORKER (R-Tenn.): Yes, so to me that\u2019s a baseline that the U.N. Security Council has agreed to, I think, six times, certainly this administration negotiated that in 2010. So they negotiated that in 2010. So as long as they can enrich, it seems to me that we are violating the very standards that we set in place in the first place.\n\n\u2014 exchange on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Dec. 1, 2013\n\nYet, in a bipartisan chorus, Menendez said \u201cwe\u2019ve already ceded a way from U.N. Security Council resolutions that say no enrichment\u201d and Corker said \u201cas long as they can enrich, it seems to me that we are violating the very standards that we set in place in the first place.\u201d\n\nAs we noted in The Fact Checker\u2019s timeline on the negotiations with Iran, from the very start of the talks with European powers in 2003, Iran insisted on its right to enrich uranium. Even though Tehran briefly suspended enrichment in 2004-2005, an acknowledgment of this \u201cright\u201d has been a central goal of its negotiators.\n\n\u201cAll of the UNSC Chapter VII sanctions resolutions on Iran are clear \u2014 Iran must suspend its enrichment program,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, who under Rice managed day-to-day diplomacy on Iran. \u201cBut, the intent was not to state that Iran could never in the future have a peaceful, civil nuclear energy program. There was never an agreement by the Perm Five countries that the no enrichment goal would last in perpetuity. That was never a U.S. objective.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where we encounter the gap between the diplomatic goals and long-term objectives. The U.N. resolutions demand suspension of enrichment as part of the process of negotiations \u2014 while leaving open the door to an era of peaceful Iranian nuclear power. The Obama administration, at least initially, said that it would demand that Iran halt enrichment during the negotiation phase. But clearly that objective was put aside in the effort to reach an interim accord.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Banking Committee on Oct. 6, 2009 \u2014 just days after the administration announced an earlier interim accord that later fell apart \u2014 then-Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg said in response to questions from Menendez that suspending enrichment was \u201cthe priority in our negotiations.\u201d Steinberg added: \u201cThey need to suspend enrichment. That\u2019s been the requirement of the Security Council, and it remains the requirement of the Security Council. So we have a number of steps beyond these preliminary steps that they have to take.\u201d\n\nAs recently as early October, Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman told Congress that \u201cwe do not believe there is an inherent right by anyone to enrichment\u201d and that \u201cIran must meet the concerns of the international community, including the United States and all of its obligations, under the NPT and the U.N. Security Council resolutions which have suspended its enrichment.\u201d\n\nBut although the interim accord with Iran places some limits on Iran\u2019s enrichment capabilities \u2014 such as not adding new centrifuge machines or enriching up to 20 percent \u2014 it does not require a full suspension. Indeed, the agreement speaks of a final accord that \u201cwould involve a mutually defined enrichment program with practical limits and transparency measures to ensure the peaceful nature of the program.\u201d\n\nThat language suggests enrichment may never take a pause, though of course \u201cmutually defined\u201d also means all seven parties, including the United States, would have to agree on the terms. Moreover, the sanctions in the U.N. resolutions do appear to hinge on whether Iran complies with international demands, such as suspending uranium enrichment.\n\nSpokesman for Menendez and Corker said they were not suggesting that the U.N. resolutions require a final agreement to include a halt on uranium enrichment, but that they were expressing a concern that this key goal as part of the negotiations was being lost in the interim accord. For his part, Corker has introduced legislation that would set full suspension of uranium enrichment as one of the \u201cminimum conditions for any final agreement.\u201d\n\nThe administration, for its part, appears to have set that goal aside in an effort to keep the diplomacy moving. The lawmakers are certainly within their rights to call attention to this decision, but they should be more precise in their language about what the U.N. resolutions actually require. Given that they were speaking on live television and this is a complex issue, their comments, at this point, do not yet rise to the level of a Pinocchio.", "lang": "en"}
