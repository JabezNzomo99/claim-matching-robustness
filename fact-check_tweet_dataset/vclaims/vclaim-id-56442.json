The posts also claim Israeli citizens have protected themselves from COVID-19 by drinking a remedy of hot water, lemon and baking soda, which purportedly \"kills\" the virus. Both claims are false; as of June 21 the World Health Organization (WHO) states Israel has reported 305 deaths from COVID-19; health experts say there is no evidence the baking soda concoction can cure or prevent COVID-19 infections.\n\nThe photo was shared here on Facebook on April 16, 2020.\n\nThe post claims a \"cure or the way to eliminate\" COVID-19 has been discovered in Israel -- a mixture of lemon and bicarbonate in water -- which has resulted in no COVID-19 related deaths in the country.\n\nA screenshot of the misleading Facebook post taken on June 22, 2020\n\nThe post reads, in part: \"IN ISRAEL NO DEATH FROM COVID-19 / The cure for the C19 virus or the way to eliminate it was achieved. Information comes from Israel, there this virus did not cause any death.\n\n\"The recipe is simple / 1. Lemon / 2. Bicarbonate. Mix and drink as hot tea every afternoon\u2026 immediately kills the virus, completely eliminates it from the body.\"\n\nA similar claim has also been shared here, here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claims, however, are false.\n\nAccording to the WHO, Israel reported its first COVID-19 death on March 20, 2020, and as of June 21, 2020, a total of 305 deaths related to the disease have been reported in the country.\n\nHealth experts also say there is \"no evidence\" that mixing lemon and bicarbonate can provide immunity from COVID-19 infections.\n\nCristian Paredes, a professor of clinical pharmacy at the Catholic University of Chile told AFP on May 27, 2020: \"There is no evidence that any derivative of lemon juice can improve or prevent a COVID-19 infection.\"\n\nAlso Read: No, Dr. Anthony Fauci Did Not Say Vaccines Are Toxic\n\nSubstances found in lemon juice and bicarbonate are also not among the list of compounds that are known to be able to remove the novel coronavirus from surfaces, he added.\n\nSimilarly, Olosmira Correa, an assistant professor at the Department of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology at the University of Chile, told AFP there is \"no scientific basis\" in claims that say a virus can be \"killed\".\n\nShe said: \"It is not a dangerous mixture, but it does not have an effect on COVID-19 disease, it does not improve symptoms or help in any way.\"\n\nAs of June 22, 2020, the WHO also maintains that \"there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure\" COVID-19.\n\nThe claim was also debunked by the AFP Fact Check team here in Spanish.", "lang": "en"}
