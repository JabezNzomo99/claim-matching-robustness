It refers to the number of records in the Department of Veterans Affairs health-care database marked as \u201cpending\u201d for people who had already died.\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible to know whether those veterans had died before or after the VA began its health-care enrollment system, or whether they had applied for health care. We urge the Trump campaign to correct this inaccuracy that has been on its website for the past eight months.\n\nTrump\u2019s claims about veterans\u2019 suicides stood out to us, as the talking point is often misused by politicians. Trump said there are 20 veteran suicides a day, that suicides are more prevalent among older veterans, and that evidence shows veterans receiving care are less likely to commit suicide. To our delight, he accurately conveyed the 2014 preliminary findings from the most comprehensive study to date on veteran suicides \u2014 an issue that is often presented by politicians without context. Here are the facts.\n\nThe go-to figure used for veteran suicides has been 22 \u2014 that there are 22 veteran suicides a day. We\u2019ve awarded Two Pinocchios to this claim in the past, when politicians use it with no context. But this widely cited statistic is a rough and outdated estimate based on partial data. It comes from the VA\u2019s 2012 Suicide Data Report, which used death certificate data from fewer than half the states, and did not include some states with the largest veteran populations (such as Arizona, California, Texas and North Carolina).\n\nMoreover, it was an estimate \u2014 researchers took the percentage of veteran deaths identified as suicides, out of all suicides from those states during 1999 to 2011. Then they applied that percentage to the number of suicides in the United States in a given year. That came out to 22 suicides a day.\n\nBut this figure, when used alone, has no context and says nothing useful about veteran suicides. It doesn\u2019t tell you that suicide may be more or less common among certain veteran populations, how it compares to the civilian population, or any other important aspects of veteran suicides that should drive policymaking. Yet it\u2019s used all the time and has become a symbol of its own; there\u2019s even a movement to do 22 push-ups for 22 days (see: #22pushups) in honor of veterans who committed suicide.\n\nLast week, the VA announced preliminary findings from its most comprehensive veteran suicide study to date. The VA worked with the Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a study of veterans\u2019 mortality records, for the first time piecing together 55 million veteran records over 35 years using military, health and mortality data. The full report is scheduled for release by the end of this month.\n\nResearchers found that in 2014, an average of 20 veterans died from suicide a day. This is an actual count from veteran records collected from all 50 states. Among the suicides in 2014, 65 percent were of veterans 50 years and older. And researchers found that from 2001 to 2014, the rate of suicide among veterans who used VA services increased at 8.8 percent, compared to 38.6 percent among veterans who did not use VA services.\n\nIn his speech, Trump proposed increasing the number of mental health professionals within and outside of the VA system. He also said there should be more outreach to veterans who are not in the VA system but may need mental health care. He said improving mental health care for veterans should be a part of a nationwide effort, such as expanding the number of facilities, integrating mental health services with primary care, changing confinement rules and making it easier for family members to report warning signs.\n\nBoth veteran and civilian suicide rates have been on the rise. Adult civilian suicides increased 23 percent from 2001 to 2014, and veteran suicides increased 32 percent during that time, according to the study. A breakdown of the 2014 crude rates per 100,000 by age group is below (the civilian rates are lower than general population rates reported by CDC, as they do not include veterans):\n\nWhile the 20-per-day figure is now updated, Bossarte again warned against simply using the figure as a talking point. The VA released the updated figure because of the public interest in the latest daily average, but Bossarte said he hopes that people also talk about the number in context when they use it.\n\n\u201cWe understand, of course, that it\u2019s become part of the narrative among veteran suicide and become a part of the national dialogue,\u201d Bossarte said. \u201cBut once again, it\u2019s not the most useful for understanding how things are changing over time. Within that straightforward number, you really can\u2019t capture the complex changes\u201d within the veteran population.\n\nTrump said there are 20 veteran suicides a day, that suicides are more prevalent among older veterans, and that evidence shows veterans receiving care are less likely to commit suicide. He accurately cites the three points from 2014 results of the latest study on veteran suicides. His claim on solid ground because it adds context about suicides among older veterans and the difference in suicide rates among those who use VA services and those who don\u2019t.\n\nThe Geppetto Checkmark has been particularly elusive for Trump, who has earned one Geppetto Checkmark since he declared his candidacy in June 2015. But he got it right this time, so we will send off the presumptive Republican nominee to the Republican National Convention with the rare Geppetto Checkmark.", "lang": "en"}
