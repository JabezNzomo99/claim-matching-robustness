That rule is still in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.\n\nSo a woman who terminates her pregnancy, or a doctor who performs the termination, without following the rules from the 1967 Act commits a crime.\n\nIn practice, prosecutions are very rare. The number of illegal abortions found in police records every year is in the single digits.\n\nSome\u2014perhaps most\u2014of these prosecutions actually involve men who assault a pregnant woman or secretly give her drugs to trigger an abortion. Professor Sally Sheldon of Kent Law School says she has found only two convictions of women illegally terminating their own pregnancy in the past decade.\n\nNevertheless, campaigners argue that women looking for abortion drugs, particularly online, shouldn\u2019t be at risk of prosecution.\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t mean abortion drugs being freely available from online sources. It would still be illegal to sell them because they\u2019re prescription medications. But only the seller would be open to prosecution, not the woman buying them.\n\nOpponents say that decriminalisation would \u201cembolden those men who pressurise women into abortions that they do not wish to have\u201d.\n\nThe fact that MPs have voted in principle for this change to the law doesn\u2019t mean it will happen. The vote was on a Bill introduced under the Ten Minute Rule by a backbench MP. Such Bills rarely pass in the end, as there\u2019s not always time in the parliamentary calendar.\n\nTwo doctors think that the pregnancy is under 24 weeks and it continuing would involve risk, \u201cgreater than if the pregnancy were terminated\u201d, to the pregnant woman\u2019s physical or mental health.\n\nTwo doctors think that the pregnancy is under 24 weeks and it continuing would involve risk, \u201cgreater than if the pregnancy were terminated\u201d, to the physical or mental health of other children in the family.\n\nTwo doctors think that \u201cthe termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury\u201d to the pregnant woman\u2019s physical or mental health.\n\nTwo doctors think that continuing the pregnancy would involve risk to the pregnant woman\u2019s life, \u201cgreater than if the pregnancy were terminated\u201d.\n\nTwo doctors think that there is a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that the child would be born \u201cseriously handicapped\u201d.\n\nA doctor thinks that the termination is necessary in an emergency to save the life of a pregnant woman.\n\nA doctor thinks that the termination is necessary in an emergency to \u201cprevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health\u201d of the pregnant woman.", "lang": "en"}
