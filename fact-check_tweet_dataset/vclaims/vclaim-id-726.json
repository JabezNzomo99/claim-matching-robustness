The DNC has since pledged to restore the Sanders campaign's access to the voter files.\n\nOn 18 December 2015, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign became embroiled in a controversy with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) over alleged improper access of voter data by the Vermont senator\u2019s staffers.\n\nA New York Times article published on that date (\u201cClash Erupts Between Bernie Sanders Campaign and Democratic Party\u201d) reported that the allegations originated with a \u201cdropped firewall\u201d in proprietary campaign software managed by the outside firm NGP VAN. The paper\u2019s reporting indicated that the data contractor was \u201cmaking a tweak to its system\u201d that inadvertently created a situation in which \u201cthe campaigns could see each others\u2019 information\u201d but \u201conly the Sanders campaign accessed data that was proprietary.\u201d The precise circumstances under which that data was accessed (or how the disputed access occurred) was not detailed in initial reports.\n\nAfter news broke, the Sanders campaign terminated staffer Josh Uretsky, who was managing three other staffers (with all four being accused of improperly accessing Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign data). Uretsky asserted in an interview that \u201che had merely been trying to verify the breach,\u201d not obtain any information that should have remained private:\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC, Uretsky again asserted that the actions were taken purposefully in order to generate proof that a breach was possible, but we were unable to locate any corroboration of his claim made by anyone knowledgeable about the particular software package in question:\n\nAs a result of NGP VAN\u2019s \u201cdropped firewall\u201d and the data access controversy, the New York Times reported that the \u201cDemocratic National Committee [DNC] acted swiftly to deny the Sanders campaign future access to the party\u2019s 50-state voter file, which contains information about millions of Democrats and is invaluable to campaigns on a daily basis.\u201d Uretsky maintained that the DNC\u2019s immediate sanctions effectively paralyzed key functions of the Sanders campaign at a critical juncture:\n\nA Washington Post article (titled \u201cDNC Penalizes Sanders Campaign for Improper Access of Clinton Voter Data\u201d) described the dispute as a \u201cstrategic setback for Sanders which raised \u201cquestions about the DNC\u2019s ability to provide strategic resources to campaigns and state parties.\u201d The paper also reported that Uretsky claimed the Sanders campaign was investigating the impact of the breach on their own data, not attempting to improperly access Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign information:\n\nMuch of the reporting centered around NGP VAN\u2019s propriety software and its functionality, operative details to which most news outlets weren\u2019t specifically privy. DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that Sanders staffers \u201cdownloaded\u201d and \u201cexported\u201d the data in question:\n\nGiven the proprietary and specialized nature of NGP VAN\u2019s software, Wasserman Schultz\u2019s \u201cunlocked door\u201d analogy was difficult to assess. CNN\u2019s coverage quoted a message from Wasserman Schultz to DNC members in which she accused the Sanders campaign of \u201csystematically\u201d engaging in improper data access:\n\nMuch of the reporting about the dispute hinged on the reliability and functionality of NGP VAN\u2019s software. Unlike with commonly used software (such as Microsoft\u2019s Excel or Word), the only source available from which to gauge the level of potential malfeasance was DNC statements in news reports. However, a statement issued on 18 December 2015 by NGP VAN about the controversy appeared to contain some meaningful contradictions to Wasserman Schultz\u2019s assertions.\n\nAmong those discrepancies was the firm\u2019s description of the data in question, and another was the use of the term \u201cexport\u201d:\n\nThe statement reiterated that during a \u201cbrief window\u201d of unspecified duration, a limited amount of unauthorized data was viewable. However, NGP VAN stated that the affected data was not exportable, savable, or actionable:\n\nOn Reddit, an r/technology thread about the controversy included comment from a self-identified 2008 Obama campaign staffer who claimed such breaches were both common but of limited strategic value:\n\nAnother comment in that thread asserted that lack of public knowledge with respect to the software\u2019s interface made assessing the chain of events problematic for both the media and voters:\n\nOn 18 December 2015, the Sanders campaign filed suit against the DNC [PDF via Politico] requesting immediate injunctive relief (including restoration of access to the data). The suit referenced the \u201cDefendant\u2019s [DNC] ongoing breach of the Parties; Agreement Regarding Use of DNC National Voter File Data\u201d and held that under the terms of an agreement entered into by the Sanders campaign and the DNC on or about 26 October 2015, both parties were contractually entitled to a ten-day period in which to remedy contractual breaches:\n\nAnother portion of the suit pertained to what was referred to as the \u201cPrior Incident\u201d in the body of the filing. The Sanders campaign\u2019s suit held that a similar breach favoring the Clinton campaign in 2008 occurred but did not prompt sanctions for her campaign and constituted persistent data security lapses on the part of the DNC:\n\nIn summation, all parties agree that for a short window of time (spanning between 30 and 45 minutes) on or around 16 December 2015 four staffers for the campaign of Bernie Sanders had access to restricted data hosted by a third-party campaign company. The senior staffer in charge of the other three was fired following disclosure of the breach, that staffer maintained that staff were aware their actions were tracked and sought to create a record of the breach. The DNC immediately moved to suspend Sanders\u2019 access to the program, effectively crippling his campaign in the lead up to primaries and inhibiting the campaign\u2019s ability to engage in voter outreach. The Sanders campaign filed suit against the DNC; the suit alleged that the DNC failed to provide ten days for the Sanders campaign to rectify the breach as stipulated in an October 2015 contract, and further claimed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign engaged in a similar transmission of unauthorized data with no sanctions applied. While the controversy was widely reported, little was known about the function of NGP VAN\u2019s proprietary software, how it operated, or what the staffers\u2019 intent in accessing the data ultimately entailed. The suit is pending, and Sanders\u2019 campaign remains restricted from accessing the voter data.\n\nUpdate: Shortly after midnight on 19 December 2015, ABC News reported that the Sanders campaign and the DNC reached an agreement. The Sanders campaign stated that the DNC \u201ccapitulated,\u201d and the DNC indicated the campaign was in compliance with its request and it would in turn \u201crestor[e] the Sanders campaign\u2019s access to the voter file\u201d:\n\nA New York Times reporter tweeted a copy of the DNC\u2019s statement on the agreement:\n\nOn 29 April 2016, the Sanders campaign withdrew its suit against the DNC following a months-long investigation into the purported data breach. The Hill reported:\n\nThe DNC declined to make their findings public, and said in a statement:\n\nThe Washington Post further reported that the DNC \u201cdeclined to release the study itself by the firm CrowdStrike.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
