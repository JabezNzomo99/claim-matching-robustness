The existing uniform policy, which prohibits workers from wearing symbolic items on their uniform, has not changed, apart from extending it to face coverings, according to a Weis Markets spokesman.\n\nWeis Markets is a primarily Pennsylvania-based grocery store chain that has locations in other Mid-Atlantic states. The viral post, shared July 3, suggests that Weis Markets recently banned the sale of products depicting the American flag and banned employees from wearing representations of it.\n\n\u201cWeis Food stores will no longer sell anything with the American flag and their employees can no longer wear anything with the flag.. other than for the July 4th holiday,\u201d reads the post. It then quotes an unnamed store manager who justified the alleged move by saying, \u201cWeis is staying neutral.. they serve different groups of people in this country.\u201d\n\nWhile Weis does have a uniform policy that prohibits employees from displaying any logo, message or symbolic item, the grocery store chain has \u201cnot stopped selling products with the American flag on them,\u201d Dennis Curtin, a spokesman for the company, said in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation. A search of Weis\u2019s online catalog confirms products that use the image of the flag and reference its colors are still available for purchase.\n\nAn advertisement for Weis\u2019 military discount offer includes a graphic of an American flag, and so did a Fourth of July message from the verified Weis Markets Twitter, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that the Weis Markets uniform policy recently changed in an effort to remain \u201cneutral\u201d doesn\u2019t hold up either. The \u201cexisting dress code policy,\u201d which prohibits logos, messages and symbolic items, hasn\u2019t changed, except for adaptations for the coronavirus pandemic, according to Curtin.\n\n\u201cWe have a uniform policy for our associates which has not changed,\u201d Curtin told the DCNF. \u201cOur associates cannot wear logoed, messaged or symbolic items while working. This policy extends to face coverings, which have become part of our uniform due to our COVID-19 safety protocols.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
