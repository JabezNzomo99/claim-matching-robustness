Let\u2019s check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Chinese not being allowed into the supermarkets of Australia. Fact: The video shows an altercation between a couple and a staff member over the former\u2019s attempt to purchase the \u2018baby formula tins\u2019 beyond the supermarket\u2019s permissible limit. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were subjected to reverse image search, an article of \u2018Daily Mail\u2019 was obtained in the search results. As per this article, at a Big W store in Melbourne (Australia), an altercation broke out between a couple and a staff member over the former\u2019s purchase of \u2018baby formula tins\u2019 beyond the permissible limit in the store. The couple seen wearing face masks in the video was confronted by a staff member as they were over the limit with four tins and were seen in the same store with more of the same product earlier that day. \n\n\n\nThe same can be seen in the \u2018Newshub.co.nz\u2019 article. Also, as per the article, Woolworths, which owns Big W, has a two-tin limit on purchasing baby formula to stop people from bulk-buying them for re-sale.\n\nTo sum it up, the video shows an altercation over the baby formula tins at a Big W store in Melbourne (Australia).\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
