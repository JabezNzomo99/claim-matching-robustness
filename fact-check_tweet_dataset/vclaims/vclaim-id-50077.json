The website Now 8 News has previously published internet hoaxes.\n\nThe article, which puts up the headline \u201cLos Angeles Police: 12 White Female Bodies in Garage Freezer Tagged, \u2018Black Lives Matter,'\u201d was published on the website Now 8 News. It alleges that Los Angeles police recently came across a \u201cgruesome discovery\u201d in the garage of a home in a residential area.\n\n\u201cThe bodies had several things in common \u2013 they were all white women in their mid-20s, blonde hair and all had the writings marked on them which read \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 and \u2018BLM,'\u201d reads the article. \u201cMathis, who was known for his involvement in the \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 movement was arrested without incident and booked into the county jail on no bond.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Los Angeles police found bodies in such a state. Had they done so, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. The Los Angeles Police Department has also not put out a press release about the supposed case.\n\nThe photos accompanying the Nows 8 News article are unrelated to the alleged crime, further adding to its dubiousness.

The other photo depicts Los Angeles County Coroner\u2019s officials removing a refrigerator containing a man\u2019s body from a marijuana growing operation that same year, per the Los Angeles-based station KTLA\u2019s caption.\n\nIterations of the claim have circulated over the years, with the setting in cities such as Chicago, Illinois, and Greenville, North Carolina, according to FactCheck.org. Now 8 News, which Snopes labeled as a fake news site in 2016, has published internet hoaxes in the past.", "lang": "en"}
