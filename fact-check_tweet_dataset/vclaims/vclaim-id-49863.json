{"title": "Putin, a Rainbow Flag, and Discrimination in Russia", "subtitle": "Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has changed its criminal code to allow targeting and prosecuting minorities and amended the constitution to outlaw gay marriage.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "July 10, 2020", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-49863", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/putin-discrimination-claim-false/30716970.html", "vclaim": "On July 3, following a national vote that took place from June 25 to July 1 and approved 206 amendments to the Russian constitution, Vladimir Putin held a virtual meeting with the members of the group that drafted the constitutional changes.\n\nThe changes included an amendment that removed legal obstacles to Putin remaining president until 2036.\n\nAt the meeting, Putin thanked the working group and asked the members to share ideas on how to safeguard and popularize the new constitution. The changes in the constitution require rewriting more than 150 federal and regional laws, banning gay marriage, mandatory studies in schools to emphasize \u201cour moral values\u201d and using foreign policy to project those values as a tool of soft power and influence abroad.\n\nAlexey Pushkov, chairman of the Federation Council\u2019s foreign affairs committee, protested the fact that the U.S. Embassy in Moscow flew a rainbow flag the day voting on the constitutional changes began. To many, the flag is an international symbol of tolerance and diversity, especially toward the LGBTQ community.\n\nPushkov said the U.S. embassy\u2019s flying of the flag signaled an \u201caggressive offence in the sphere of ideology and morals.\u201d Noting the results of the vote, he added: \u201cWe gave them a very clear answer: That we are becoming a world leader in the fight for traditional values.\u201d\n\nPutin followed up by asking Pushkov: \u201cI am sorry, Alexey Konstantinovitch, but who works in that building?\u201d\n\nPushkov answered that he was referring to the U.S. embassy. Putin repeated the question: \u201cI am asking who works in that building?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, this revealed something about the people who work there,\u201d Putin said, a comment that Reuters said was meant to mock the sexual orientation of the embassy\u2019s staff.\n\n\u201cThose who attack us in this direction are banging on an open door,\u201d Putin continued, uninterrupted. \u201cIn Russia, there has not been, is not, and will not be anything that is associated with restrictions on rights based on race, sexual orientation, nationality, or any religious grounds. This has never happened in Russia and never will.\u201d\n\nThe claim that there is no such discrimination in Russia is false.\n\nIn fact, Russia\u2019s recent history is replete with examples of violence, persecution of and discrimination against minorities. Below is the breakdown.\n\nThe nature of racism in Russia does not fit into U.S. definition of black vs. white. Rather, scholars say the issue is \u201cRussianness\u201d \u2013 ethnic Russians\u2019 putative genetic supremacy over \u201clesser\u201d people.\n\nA \u201cwide dissemination of ideas of racial hierarchy, practices of racist exclusion, and racist violence\u201d are among \u201cthe most striking changes\u201d Russia has undergone during the last 20 years, wrote Nikolay Zakharov of Sweden\u2019s Sedertorn University in his book, \u201cRace and Racism in Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been a genuine renaissance in Russia of \u2018scientific\u2019 racism,\u201d Zakharov wrote in his book. This revitalized \u201cscience of race\u201d based on biological concepts goes under a new name - \u201crasologiya\u201d (a rough analogue of Nazi Germany\u2019s Rassenkunde, or \u201cracial science\u201d), a bogus belief in racial hierarchy that supported Adolf Hitler\u2019s genocidal anti-Semitism.\n\nBlack people who went to Russia to study or work, along with those born there to mixed-race families, describe racism in Russia as \u201ccasual.\u201dTheir skin color means they face an \u201ceveryday\u201d struggle to prove they are \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201chuman,\u201d two young people told BBC this past June.\n\nRacism has festered in Russian sports. In 2018 FIFA, the international governing body for soccer associations, fined Russia for racism and Russian soccer fans\u2019 violence against black players. A year earlier, the United Nations urged Russia to \u201cvigorously combat\u201d neo-Nazi racism in its sports.\n\nDuring his first decade as president, Putin was accused of building political capital through relationships with militant right-wing groups like the nationalist Night Wolves biker club and the Kremlin-created youth movement Nashi (Ours).\n\nSome said Putin ignited racist violence in 2010 by publicly displaying support for neo-Nazi soccer fans. On national television, Putin visited the grave of one such fan, Yegor Sviridov, who had been killed the previous December in a street fight with men from the North Caucasus who claimed they acted in self-defense.\n\nSviridov\u2019s death sparked nationwide race riots against \u201cCaucasians\u201d \u2013 people from Russia\u2019s North Caucasus region who are often referred to as the \u201cRussian blacks.\u201d (In Russia, the term Caucasians is a reference to ethnicity rather than complexion.)\n\nLarge crowds in cities took to the streets chanting \u201cRussia is for Russians!\u201d Mobs attacked - and, in some cases, killed - passers-by believed to be Caucasian. Rioters in Moscow chanted and raised their arms in a Nazi-like salute.\n\nEthnic racism has existed throughout Russian history, Walt Richmond, a Russian studies professor and writer, told Polygraph.info.\n\nThere has been \u201cendemic Anti-Semitism of the Russian government\u201d beginning with Catherine the Great, the 16th Century Tsarina and continuing through 19th and 20th century pogroms (anti-Jewish purges), Richmond said. \"During World War II, there were mass deportations of more than a dozen ethnic groups from their homes in the Caucasus region to prison camps in Central Asia.\"\n\nUnder Putin, Russian law has been amended to allow the criminalization of ethnic movements and prosecution of rights activists. This past April, for example, the Russian Prosecutor General banned the U.S. think-tank the Jamestown Foundation over its reporting on the Circassians, an ethnic group native to the North Caucasus.\n\nPutin himself reportedly proposed some of the new amendments to the Russian constitution, including the one defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Gay marriage was not banned under Russia\u2019s post-Soviet constitution.\n\nA Russian law adopted in 2013 bans the \u201cpropaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\u201d and allows the government to strip parental rights and remove children from homosexual families.\n\nPutin and other Russian officials claim the law\u2019s sole purpose is to protect minors from potential sexual offenders. However, rights groups say the law has been used to shut down websites, force young people into mental institutions and persecute LGBTQ people.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2017 that the law is discriminatory and reinforces homophobia.\n\nSocial stigma and physical violence are targeted against people suspected of having a \u201cnon-traditional sexual orientation.\u201d In Chechnya, gay purges led by the head of that republic\u2019s government have resulted in the disappearance, suspected torture and execution of dozens of people.\n\nIn a move contradicting Putin\u2019s claim about there is no discrimination against sexual minorities in Russia, two Russian nationalist groups responded to the U.S. embassy\u2019s rainbow flag with a flash mob demonstration.\n\nOn July 1, a group called \u201c40x40,\u201d which believes God and Putin will raise Russia to a position of world dominance, placed a rainbow flag on the walkway in front of the American embassy in Moscow, inviting passers-by to wipe their shoes on it. Most did.\n\nOn the evening on June 29, the self-described art group \u201cRe:Vansh\u201d projected a video onto the facade of the U.S. Embassy. The video showed the cover of the Russian constitution, then photos of former U.S. and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin embracing and laughing. The caption in Russian read, \u201cIn 1993, it was yours.\u201d Subsequent images in the video showed Russians voting for the constitutional reforms, with a caption reading: \u201cIn 2020 it will be ours \u2026. No more American bookmarks along the pages of our constitution.\u201d The video then called on Russians to vote in favor of the constitutional changes.\n\nRe:Vansh had no online history, media citations or website prior to it flash mob action at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Its YouTube channel was created in April 2018, with a profile picture of the Russian constitution and a slogan similar to the one it used in the embassy video projection: \u201cIt was yours. Will be ours.\u201d As of the time of this writing, the video of the U.S. embassy flash mob was the only one ever uploaded to the channel.\n\nRussia has a long and well-cataloged history of government persecution of and atrocities against various religious groups.\n\nThe Russian government has branded the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses (JW) an \u201cextremist organization,\u201d and law-enforcement agents have raided the group\u2019s offices across Russia, confiscating their texts as evidence. JW adherents have been arrested and jailed.\n\nIn December 2018, Putin told reporters he knew nothing about the situation with the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Labelling the group extremist was \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d that should be \u201clooked into carefully,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, persecution of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses has only escalated since then, Human Rights Watch reported in January. At that time, at least 313 people were facing charges, on trial or convicted of criminal extremism, the rights group said.", "lang": "en"}
