If the municipalities don\u2019t pay up, the state withholds aid to make up the shortfall.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Cranston\u2019s minimum was 13.69 percent of payroll; the city\u2019s budget includes that amount -- about $4.8 million on the non-school side of the ledger. In other words, it\u2019s paying 100 percent of the state-mandated MERS requirement.\n\nThen there\u2019s the funding level, the percentage of what the plans need to meet their pension obligations.\n\nThe city\u2019s MERS plans are not funded exactly at 100 percent, but they're fairly close. According to the , the city has 95.9 percent of the projected police retiree costs, 107.1 percent of the projected firefighter retiree costs, and 95.1 percent of all other municipal retiree costs.\n\nAny plan with a funded ratio below 80 percent is considered to be in trouble.\n\nHowever, the old police and fire pension programs, administered by the city, are a different story because, over the years, Cranston's elected officials neglected to put enough money into those programs to cover future retiree costs.\n\nAlthough they have been closed since 1995, the city would need an additional $231 million to fully fund them. (To put that amount in perspective, the for the current fiscal year is $262 million.)\n\nThe old police pension is only 18.3 percent funded and the old fire pension program is just 24.1 percent funded, according to information from the .\n\nHowever, the city is now on a payment plan designed to wipe out that shortfall by 2042. (The date has been 2037, but a recent court settlement with the unions forced the date to be pushed back by five years.)\n\nUnder that plan, the city should be paying $22,353,591 this year, according to the city's actuarial firm, Buck Consultants. Fung, in an email to PolitiFact Rhode Island, showed where the city's appropriation for this year will actually be $22,518 more than the recommended amount.\n\nTo cover other benefits, primarily retiree health insurance, Buck recommended that the city budget $5.1 million. The city has set aside $4.6 million and plans to cover the remaining $500,000 by using about a third of its $1.6 million hospital stabilization account, which is savings accumulated because the city self-insures its workers.\n\nFung, in an interview, said he didn't intend to leave the impression in his letter to taxpayers that the city had covered 100 percent of all its pension obligations.\n\n\"If I had meant that, I would have said it was 100 percent fully funded, which is not true.\" Instead, he said his point was that, unlike in past years, the city is paying for 100 percent of its annual required contribution to solve its pension problems.\n\nWe should note that Fung has not been shy about talking about the unfunded liability of the city's old pension systems, mentioning it in interviews and on other occasions.\n\nCranston Mayor Allan Fung said, \"Our budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefit costs.\"\n\nThe city is making the minimum required payments for retirement benefits through the state-run MERS system and to pay down this year's share of the bill for the huge long-term liability incurred by the city's older police and fire pension systems.\n\nBut his statement could lead a reader to conclude that 100 percent of the city\u2019s $231 million debt for the old plans is covered by this year's budget when, in fact, the only thing the city is paying in full is this year's installment on a plan that won't retire that debt for another 28 years.\n\nBecause the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it .", "lang": "en"}
