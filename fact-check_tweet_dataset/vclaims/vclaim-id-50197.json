COVID starts with a C, which also means \u2018see\u2019 in ancient language. 19 was known as the \u201cNumber of Surrender\u201d in ancient times.\u201d It goes on to draw the conclusion, \u201cC-OVID 19 = \u2018See a Sheep Surrender'\u201d.\n\nThe June 20 post has been shared more than 160 times and is one of multiple examples found here, here and here.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a name? Plenty it seems as social media users continue to promote unusual claims about COVID-19 including the assertion that the name of the coronavirus is partly derived from Latin.\n\nIn addressing the Facebook post\u2019s linguistic claims, AAP FactCheck sought the opinion of Associate Professor Marcus John Wilson of University of Auckland\u2019s Classics and Ancient History faculty.\n\nDr Wilson told AAP FactCheck the post\u2019s claims about COVID-19\u2019s supposed linguistic origins were \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d.\n\n\u201cOvis in Latin is the word for a sheep,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no word \u2018ovid\u2019 in Latin except as a personal name (of the famous poet)\u201d. The Roman poet Ovid is best known for Metamorphoses, a 15-book poem which reworked stories from Greek mythology.\n\nDr Wilson said C did not mean \u2018see\u2019 in \u201cany language (except maybe texting abbreviations).\u201d\n\nAs for the supposed significance of the number 19 in \u201cancient times\u201d?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for them all, but I don\u2019t know of anywhere 19 has this kind of mysterious meaning,\u201d Dr Wilson told AAP FactCheck. \u201cCertainly not in Roman or other Latin speaking cultures.\u201d\n\nThe Encyclopedia Britannica\u2019s entry on number symbolism notes that eclipses of the Sun occur every 19 years and the number was considered unlucky in ancient Babylon.\n\nThe name \u201cCOVID-19\u201d was decided on by the World Health Organization after the new viral strain was named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The ICTV named the coronavirus disease, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), on February 11, 2020. World Health Organisation Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained the naming of COVID-19 at a press conference on the same date (5m58s): \u201cCO,\u2019 C-O, stands for \u2018corona,\u2019 V-I stands for \u2018virus,\u2019 \u2018D\u2019 for \u2018disease,\u2019 so \u2018COVID.'\u201d\n\nWHO says the virus was previously known as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u2019 or \u20182019-nCoV\u201d.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. The name \u201cCOVID-19\u201d is an acronym for coronavirus disease 2019 as announced by the World Health Organization. The post\u2019s claims that Ovid is Latin for sheep and the letter C means to \u201csee\u201d are also false. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
