He also didn't infect his wife the next day after the marriage went through.\n\nThe origin of the story is the highly controversial site WitTheShit who published the original article (archived here) under the title \"3 men contracted Aids from running a train on a sex doll\". The article opened:\n\nThis story comes from a Memphis man, it was told that he was about to get married and he told his fianc\u00e9e he was going to have a bachelor party. She didnt like the idea because she didnt want him with any strippers. So thinking outside of the box, 3 of his friends ordered a sex doll online for the bachelor party.\n\nThe fact that the story appeared in a category named \"Extreme Horror Humor\" should be a dead giveaway about the veracity of the article.\n\nWitTheShit is a site that bills itself as satire in a disclaimer at the bottom of the page:\n\nWitTheShit is a group who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion. 7.2 million strong We are Declaring a satire WAR on EVERYONE!\n\nTheir greatest 'hit' so far was a story about a rapper who was arrested for murder after revealing he did it in a rap song. They also invented other stories about sexual harrasment and drugs in the past, so anything they publish should be taken with a big grain of salt.", "lang": "en"}
