However, the claims are false -- IPSOS confirmed that the company has released no such poll, calling the figures \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nOne of the misleading posts, which we\u2019ve archived here, was published on the public Facebook group Kenya Political Forum which has more than a million members. The post attracted more than 100 comments and reactions.\n\nThe bogus popularity ratings, captured in a graphical presentation that includes the IPSOS logo, implied that Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto was the most preferred candidate followed by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.\n\nThe graphic also gives invented popularity ratings for three other prominent political figures: former vice presidents Musalia Mudavadi and Kalonzo Musyoka, and Gideon Moi, a senator who is the son of Kenya\u2019s second president.\n\nOf the five of them, so far only Ruto has publicly indicated that he intends to run for president in 2022.\n\nThe website Kenya Top Secrets published an article based on the supposed survey, while other posts carrying the fake IPSOS graphic can be found here and here.\n\nHowever, no such polling data is available on the IPSOS website, and the company confirmed in a tweet on July 3, 2019 that it had released no such survey.\n\n\u201cIpsos has not released any poll on the popularity of presidential aspirants. The poll on social media is a FAKE poll,\u201d the tweet from the French company\u2019s Kenyan branch reads.\n\nThe Twitter account, @IpsosKE, is linked to from the company\u2019s official website.\n\nKenyatta was sworn in for his second and final term in November 2017 and politicians are already discussing who might succeed him when he steps down in 2022.\n\nHowever, Kenyatta has steered away from the topic of his succession in public and angrily called on colleagues to stop politicking and focus on development instead.", "lang": "en"}
