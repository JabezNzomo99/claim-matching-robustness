Well doesn\u2019t that tell you something,\u201d one user captioned the photo.\n\nWhile this image does show Soros\u2019 son, Alexander, Markle is not pictured.\n\nAhead of President Donald Trump\u2019s state visit to Britain and before debate erupted over whether Trump called Markle \u201cnasty,\u201d this image re-emerged after previously being used to claim that Soros and Markle both attended a \u201cspirit cooking\u201d event in 2013.\n\nThere\u2019s one major problem, though: the woman pictured is not Markle. Rather, it is a woman named Hannah Motley. The man in the image is Alexander Soros, son of billionaire philanthropist and Democratic donor George Soros. Motley appears to be the daughter of Joel Motley, chairman emeritus on the board of Human Rights Watch.\n\nAccording to contemporaneous reporting from The Wall Street Journal, the photo shows Motley and Soros attending an avant-garde art experience in the Hamptons. It had nothing to do with Trump or the British royal family and took place nearly six years before Trump\u2019s recent state visit.\n\nMarkle, who was an actress before marrying into the royal family, was not present during Trump\u2019s meetings with the queen and other family members. She welcomed her first child, Archie, in early May.", "lang": "en"}
