The claim is false; the photo has circulated in news reports since 2015 about an American cancer survivor who received a scalp transplant; the story about a man who had a brain transplant previously appeared on a satirical website.\n\nThe image and claim were published on Facebook here by a Pakistan-based page with more than 9,500 followers.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post on Facebook:\n\nThe text in the post states in part: \u201cMan who had woman\u2019s brain transplanted had five car crashes in two weeks.\n\nIt also says: \u201c53-year-old man named Phil Robertson from Scranton in Pennsylvania was miraculously saved from a brain cancer a few months ago by undergoing a successful brain transplant.\n\n\u201cHe received the brain of a 37-year old woman who had died in a car accident and the operation had unforeseen consequences for the poor man.\u201d\n\nPosts making a similar claim were also shared here and here on Facebook and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo previously appeared in news reports about a 55-year-old cancer survivor named Jim Boysen, who was the first man to receive a partial skull and scalp transplant in May 22, 2015, at Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of this Indonesian-language BBC report from the time which contains the image, translated to English:\n\nSome of the false posts also included a photo of a man referred to as Dr. James Ford.\n\nBut a reverse image found the same photo published here on November 8, 2011 on a Flickr page that describes itself as the official \"Army Medicine\" account of the US military.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo as it appears on Flickr:\n\nThe caption states in part: \"Army Col.
