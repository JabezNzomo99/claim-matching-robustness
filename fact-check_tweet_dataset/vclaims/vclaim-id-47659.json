Kennedy, Jr. and published between 1995 and 2001. Although this issue does feature a lengthy interview with Gates, the quote featured here comes from an entirely different article.\n\nThe February 1997 issue of George magazine included a \u201cSurvival Guide to the Future\u201d that featured various commentators describing how the world was \u201cnow\u201d and providing their thoughts on what the world would be like in 2020. The actual article, titled \u201cA Nation\u2019s Future Foretold,\u201d was divided into themed sections such as transportation, education, environment, crime, warfare, and food. The quote shown in the viral image comes from the disease section of this article. Here\u2019s a screenshot from a digital copy of the magazine, which more clearly shows the author of this text:\n\nThe end of the article comes after a page break, where you can read the pull-quote in context:\n\nGates did not write that an \u201cover-populated planet\u201d would be \u201cchoked to extinction by a lung-attacking virus.\u201d This article was actually written by poet and science writer Arno Karlen.\n\nHowever, social media users did find an actual quote from Gates in this issue of George that they presented as equally controversial as the \u201clung-attacking virus\u201d quote. A second image showing an excerpt from this issue appears to show Gates talking about \u201cfunding population control\u201d:\n\nThis, again, is a genuine image from the February 1997 issue of George magazine. And this time, it is a genuine quote from Gates. He made this comment shortly after he was asked about how he keeps his personal opinions separate from his business decisions:\n\nWhile this quote is often shared as if it revealed some secret and nefarious plot from the former Microsoft CEO, the truth is a bit more mundane.\n\nThis quote was widely circulated by those who adhere to the idea that Gates was using the COVID-19 pandemic to give himself an opportunity to microchip the population via vaccines. The above-displayed quote shows, according to proponents of this conspiracy theory, that Gates has long been planning to take control of the global population. We took a deeper look into the \u201cID2020\u201d conspiracy theory here.\n\nHowever, the term \u201cpopulation control\u201d isn\u2019t as literal as it may seem in this context. This term was widely used in the 1970s and \u201980s, but it fell out of fashion in the \u201990s and was replaced by terms such as \u201creproductive health,\u201d \u201cfamily planning,\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment.\u201d\n\nIn writing about the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development in 1994, the Christian Science Monitor noted a major philosophical difference between that year\u2019s conference and conferences from years past:\n\nIf there is a major philosophical difference in the 1994 version of the once-a-decade international conference on population, it is the shift from \u201cpopulation control\u201d to \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment\u201d \u2014 especially in areas of reproductive health, education, and economic opportunities, which planners of the UN conference see as closely linked to fertility rates. \u201cEconomic growth and improvement of quality of life have been fastest in those areas where women have higher status, and slowest where they face the greatest disadvantages,\u201d states the draft \u201cProgramme of Action\u201d now being debated in New York.\n\nGates\u2019 quote in this 1997 interview may have been a bit outdated, but it was not indicative of a nefarious plot to enslave humankind. Rather, Gates was noting his charitable work with global organizations that support reproductive health programs.\n\nFor example, in 1997, the year this interview was published, the Gates Foundation awarded a $2.2 million grant to Johns Hopkins University to \u201csupport the Institute for Population and Reproductive Health to strengthen leadership and institutions in the developing countries.\u201d Two years later in 1999, Bill and Melinda Gates donated $2.2 billion to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\n\nThat same epiphany for his public health philanthropy came even earlier. Bill\u2019s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle\u2019s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control \u2014 among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them \u2014 Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls \u2014 specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people \u2014 the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. \u201cIt goes against common sense,\u201d Gates says. Most parents don\u2019t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die. \u201cIf a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,\u201d says Melinda. In terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn. Rather than prevent births, he would aim his billions at saving the kids already born. \u201cWe moved pretty heavily into vaccines once we understood that,\u201d says Gates.", "lang": "en"}
