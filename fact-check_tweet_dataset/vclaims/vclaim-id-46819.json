Where are the siblings Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi.\u201d (translated). The accompanying video shows a man making these statements. The tweet has been shared close to 10,000 times since then.\n\nThe same assertion was also made Pakistani Canadian author Tarek Fatah and army veteran Major Surendra Poonia.\n\nThe video posted by Patra dates back to August 2017. It features Samajwadi Party leader Mavia Ali who had kicked up a storm while reacting to Uttar Pradesh government\u2019s controversial circular asking madrasas across the state to celebrate Independence Day and record a video of the event. Mavia\u2019s statement was widely reported in media at that time.\n\nMavia Ali is a politician associated with the Samajwadi Party. He was an MLA representing Deoband in 2016-17. Naseemuddin Siddiqui, on the other hand, is a Congress leader who was earlier associated with Bahujan Samaj Party.\n\nSeveral Twitter users have also shared Mavia Ali\u2019s statement without the video. Among them was a parody account of journalist Pushpendra Kulshreshtha. \u201c\u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0915\u093e \u0906\u0932\u093e \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e \u0928\u0938\u094d\u0938\u093f\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0940\u0928 \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0940\u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0939 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u201c\u0939\u092e \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948 .. \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928\u0940.. \u0907\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0947 \u091f\u0915\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0938\u0902\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u094b \u092d\u0940 \u0939\u092e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0947 ..\u0939\u092e \u0907\u0938 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u0935\u092b\u093c\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0948 .. \u0915\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0935\u092b\u093c\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948?\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe video is massively viral on Facebook, posted by many pages including \u2018I Support Modi Ji and BJP\u2019.\n\nIt is not clear why BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra, Tarek Fatah and Major Surendra Poonia dug out an old, widely publicized video of an SP leader Mavia Ali and shared it alleging that it featured a Congress leader Naseemuddin Siddiqui. Siddiqui is a well-known face in Uttar Pradesh politics and the misinformation was immediately countered by several twitter users. None of the misleading tweets are deleted yet. In fact, Fatah tweeted, \u201cI\u2019ve been told the Mullah in this video is one \u201cMuawiya Ali\u201d, not Nasimuddin Siddiqui\u201d but did not take down the video.", "lang": "en"}
