Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La..\n\nAs Kimmel laid it out, the Graham-Cassidy bill failed on four points:\n\n\"Coverage for all? No. In fact it will kick about 30 million Americans off insurance.\n\n\"Pre-existing conditions? Nope. If the bill passes, individual states can let insurance companies charge you more if you have a pre-existing condition. You\u2019ll find that little loophole later in the document, after it says they can\u2019t. They can and they will.\n\n\"But will it lower premiums? Well, in fact for lots of people, the bill will result in higher premiums.\n\n\"And as far as lifetime caps go, the states can decide on that too, which means there will be no lifetime caps in many states.\"\n\nWonks that we are, we\u2019ll focus here on Kimmel\u2019s policy points and see how well they track with what\u2019s in the bill and the studies that have been done.\n\nWe do this without an estimate of the bill\u2019s impact from the Congressional Budget Office. The nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress said it would not be able to give a full accounting in time for a vote by the end of September.\n\nThe bottom line: Kimmel goes too far in his criticisms, but he has grounds for waving the red flag. Solid protections under Obamacare have been replaced with squishier state options. There would be less money for health care, and while some would argue that states can do more with less, life might not turn out that way.\n\nThis claim is unverifiable. Kimmel put a big number out there, and there is reason to question it. But backers of the bill can\u2019t point to the CBO to rebut him.\n\nOne way to see how reasonable Kimmel\u2019s figure might be is to compare it to the biggest estimate the CBO produced when it looked at a complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act. By its reckoning, repeal would cut federal health care spending by $1.4 trillion in the 2017-26 period.\n\nThe drop in spending, along with many legal changes, would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million people.\n\nBy comparison, the left-leaning think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, estimates that from 2020 to 2026, the cumulative cut under Graham-Cassidy would be $418 billion \u2014 or one-third the reduction under total repeal. If a total repeal produced 32 million more uninsured people, it\u2019s hard to see how a much smaller reduction would produce nearly the same loss of coverage.\n\nAnother estimate from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities that focused on the bill\u2019s spending plan provides some support for Kimmel\u2019s number. The bill\u2019s multi-billion dollar health care block grant for states ends after 2026, and its use of a per capita spending formula for Medicaid curtails growth in that program.\n\nThe center said that funding cliff would have a grim result. It said the bill would leave 32 million more people uninsured by 2026 and \"the Cassidy-Graham bill would presumably result in even deeper coverage losses than that in the second decade.\"\n\nCasssidy\u2019s press secretary Ty Bofferding called warnings that the money would simply stop after 2026 alarmist. Bofferding said the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program has been funded continuously even though permanent appropriations were not in the original bill.\n\nBofferding said his office predicts more people will have health insurance: \"This legislation has far more enrollment incentives than previous repeal and replace attempts so we expect improved coverage.\"\n\nThat said, we don\u2019t have a good estimate.\n\nKimmel acknowledged that Cassidy\u2019s bill allows states to set the rules and companies to make their own decisions, but when it comes to hiking premiums on those already ill, he said \"they can and they will.\"\n\nThe bill does create that possibility.\n\nIn its section on waivers, it puts two options on the table. One would allow states to do away with \"any provision that restricts the criteria which a health insurance issuer may use to vary premium rates.\" The other would eliminate the requirement for every plan to offer a minimum set of health insurance benefits. We\u2019re talking here about things such as maternity or mental health coverage.\n\nLegally, there is no question insurance companies would gain the flexibility that Kimmel said in states with a waiver. What would happen in practice is less certain.\n\nThe bill says states must show how they \"intend\" to keep coverage affordable for people with pre-existing conditions. That offers some cushion, although the intent to protect a group of people is not the same as guaranteeing that protection.\n\nBofferding of Cassidy\u2019s office said states would be held to their promise or face consequences for misusing federal dollars.\n\nThe states could choose to use some of their block grant money to make coverage affordable. But that would be a budget decision subject to many competing demands within a state. And there\u2019s no question that there would be a lot of competition for those health care dollars.\n\nSo Kimmel is correct on the possibility, but he predicts the outcome with great certainty and we don\u2019t know what would actually happen.\n\nClaim: \u2018For lots of people, the bill will result in higher premiums\u2019\n\nThe CBO\u2019s reports on previous repeal attempts, both the House bill and the first Senate bill, lend some weight to Kimmel\u2019s point.\n\nThose proposals gave insurance companies more leeway in setting premiums. In general, younger and healthier people would see their premiums go down, while older and sicker people would see their premiums rise.\n\nWhen the CBO included all out-of-pocket costs, the results were even worse for older Americans.\n\nBut we have to mention two caveats. First, states could use their federal money to cushion the premium hit on older residents, subject to all the other demands on those dollars.\n\nSecond, the Graham-Cassidy bill allows wide use of catastrophic health insurance. This sort of limited coverage might well not qualify as actual health insurance by CBO standards. When supporters of the bill talk about coverage, they might be using a very different definition than what has been used until now.\n\nClaim: \u2018There will be no lifetime caps in many states\u2019\n\nThe loss of lifetime caps is the dodgiest of Kimmel\u2019s claims, because the bill cuts both ways on this point. One section of the Affordable Care Act specifically prohibits insurance companies from setting a limit on how much they will pay for a person\u2019s care in the course of their lifetime.\n\nOn the other hand, that protection only applies to care that falls under essential health benefits. In states that receive a waiver, the essential health benefits could be trimmed down, and with them, the ban on lifetime and annual caps.\n\nThis is one reason that 16 patient and health care provider groups, including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association, signed a letter opposing the Graham-Cassidy bill.\n\nAgain, we don\u2019t know for sure what would happen. Kimmel assumes the worst, but no one has a crystal ball.\n\nNote: This story was updated Sept. 22 to reflect CBPP's estimate that the Graham-Cassidy bill would lead to 32 million uninsured.", "lang": "en"}
