U.S. intelligence has named only Russia as the culprit. A Jan. 6 report based on the work of three intelligence agencies said Putin \u201cordered\u201d a broad \u201cinfluence campaign\u201d to help elect Trump.\n\u2022 Trump claimed former President Barack Obama \u201cdid nothing\u201d from August to Nov. 8 about Russia meddling in the election. That\u2019s wrong. Among other things, Obama spoke to Putin about the issue in September, and his administration worked with state officials from mid-August until Election Day to prevent voting systems from being hacked.\n\nThe president made his remarks during a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on July 6. Trump made the stop in Poland on his way to a Group of 20 summit meeting in Germany, where he is scheduled to meet with Putin on July 7.\n\nHallie Jackson of NBC News asked the president if he would \u201conce and for all, yes or no, definitively say that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\u201d He gave a less-than-definitive answer.\n\nThere is no evidence that other countries were involved in the cyberattacks.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement on Oct. 7, 2016, that said the U.S. intelligence community is \u201cconfident\u201d that hacks into the email systems of the Democratic Party and its officials were directed by \u201cRussia\u2019s senior most officials.\u201d The U.S. intelligence community includes 17 separate intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cSuch activity is not new to Moscow \u2014 the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\u201d\n\nAfter the election, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a declassified report on Jan. 6 that went even further. That report said that \u201cPutin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump\u201d and that \u201cPutin ordered an influence campaign\u201d to help Trump and damage his opponent, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 25-page report was \u201cdrafted and coordinated\u201d among three intelligence agencies \u2014 the CIA, FBI and the National Security Agency \u2014 based on \u201cintelligence information collected and disseminated by those three agencies.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the report said, Russian military intelligence gained access to Democratic National Committee computers from July 2015 to June 2016 and then used WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and \u201cGuccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker,\u201d to publicly release hacked emails and documents. The cyberattacks and public release of hacked material were part of larger \u201cRussian propaganda efforts\u201d to hurt Clinton and help Trump, the report said.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s state-run propaganda machine \u2014 comprised of its domestic media apparatus, outlets targeting global audiences such as RT and Sputnik, and a network of quasi-government trolls \u2014 contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences,\u201d the report said. \u201cState-owned Russian media made increasingly favorable comments about President-elect Trump as the 2016 US general and primary election campaigns progressed while consistently offering negative coverage of Secretary Clinton.\u201d\n\nIn sworn testimony before the Senate intelligence committee on June 8, former FBI Director James Comey said there should be no confusion that Russia interfered with the election.\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time that Trump has questioned U.S. intelligence on Russia. He did so before and after winning the election, sometimes in the same way as he did at his Warsaw press conference.\n\nAfter the election, Trump issued a statement on Dec. 9 that compared U.S. intelligence on Russia\u2019s election meddling to U.S. intelligence on Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. At his press conference in Poland, Trump again raised the issue of WMDs. He said \u201ceverybody was 100 percent sure that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d but faulty intelligence \u201cled to one big mess.\u201d\n\nAnd, as he did in Poland, Trump told Time magazine in a Nov. 28, 2016, interview: \u201cIt could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nBut no evidence to date has emerged that China or any other country was involved.\n\nUpdate, July 7: Two House members \u2013 a Republican and a Democrat \u2013 said they have seen no evidence that any country other than Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nCNN\u2019s John Berman asked Rep. Jim Himes in a July 6 interview: \u201c[H]ave you seen any evidence that any other country besides Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 election?\u201d Himes, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, responded, \u201cNone. None.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a July 7 interview on MSNBC that the intelligence reports and briefings that he has received show \u201cvery clear and convincing evidence that it was a nation state attack by Russia.\u201d\n\nEven though he continues to question the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s findings, Trump criticized Obama for doing \u201cnothing\u201d about Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the election.\n\nTrump is referring to a Washington Post story \u2014 \u201cObama\u2019s secret struggle to punish Russia for Putin\u2019s election assault\u201d \u2014 that said Obama received a CIA report in early August that detailed Putin\u2019s \u201cdirect involvement in a cyber campaign to disrupt and discredit the U.S. presidential race.\u201d The story said the CIA \u201ccaptured Putin\u2019s specific instructions on the operation\u2019s audacious objectives \u2014 defeat or at least damage the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and help elect her opponent, Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Post story detailed the internal debate within the Obama administration on what action to take against Russia.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Dec. 29 that Obama announced that he would impose sanctions on Russia for interfering in the election. At the time, Trump criticized the sanctions. \u201cIt\u2019s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,\u201d Trump said in a statement.\n\nThere are certainly Democrats who believe that Obama didn\u2019t do enough to alert the public about the extent of Russia\u2019s meddling in the election. But Trump goes too far when he \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 says that Obama \u201cdid nothing about it.\u201d\n\nSo, what did Obama and his administration do from early August until Election Day on Nov. 8?\n\nObama answered that question during a Dec. 16 press conference when he was asked about the \u201cperception that you\u2019re letting President Putin get away with interfering in the U.S. election.\u201d At the time, the president had yet to impose sanctions, which would not come for nearly two more weeks.\n\nThat public announcement was made, as we said earlier, in a statement by the Department of Homeland Security and DNI on Oct. 7. But that announcement competed for public attention with other major breaking news in that same 24-hour news cycle: The Washington Post published a story and video of lewd comments that Trump made about women while talking with Billy Bush, then of \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Oct. 7 announcement, Obama also said that he confronted Putin about the hacking at a G-20 summit in September.\n\nWikiLeaks began to release hacked emails on July 22 \u2014 about two weeks before Obama had been briefed by the CIA on Putin\u2019s direct role in the hacking. That damage was already done, so the Obama administration turned its attention to securing the nation\u2019s voting systems.\n\nObama said his \u201cprincipal goal leading up to the election\u201d was to prevent Russia from hacking into voting systems and tampering with registration rolls and ballots. That was accomplished through the Department of Homeland Security, and it started at about the time that Obama first learned in mid-August about Putin\u2019s desire to help Trump win the election.\n\nOn Aug. 15, then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson held a conference call with members of the National Association of Secretaries of State and other election officials. A readout of the call said, \u201cWhile DHS is not aware of any specific or credible cybersecurity threats relating to the upcoming general election systems, Secretary Johnson reiterated that DHS, the Election Assistance Commission, NIST, and DOJ are available to offer support and assistance in protecting against cyber attacks.\u201d He also said that the department \u201cwould be examining whether designating certain electoral systems as critical infrastructure would be an effective way to offer this support.\u201d\n\nThe designation of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d would have given states \u201cpriority in terms of the assistance we give on cyber security,\u201d Johnson testified at a June 21 House intelligence committee hearing on Russia\u2019s meddling. Other sectors designated as \u201ccritical\u201d include the defense, energy and financial sectors, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMany state officials were \u201cresisting the idea of a designation to be critical infrastructure,\u201d Johnson testified.\n\nOn Aug. 29, two weeks after Johnson\u2019s conference call with election officials, the Washington Post reported that hackers were targeting voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois. The story said, \u201c[T]he FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 15, the Election Assistance Commission issued security tips for securing voter registration databases. A day later, Johnson issued a statement that warned about attacks on voter registration data.\n\n\u201cIn recent months we have seen cyber intrusions involving political institutions and personal communications,\u201d Johnson\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe have also seen some efforts at cyber intrusions of voter registration data maintained in state election systems.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 1, Johnson issued another statement that warned about attacks on voting-related systems, including a few successful attacks. \u201cIn recent months, malicious cyber actors have been scanning a large number of state systems, which could be a preamble to attempted intrusions,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn a few cases, we have determined that malicious actors gained access to state voting-related systems. However, we are not aware at this time of any manipulation of data.\u201d\n\nThe statement urged states to seek the department\u2019s help to secure their voting data and equipment. \u201cSo far, 21 states have contacted us about our services,\u201d the statement said. By Oct. 10, that number had risen to 33 states, the department said.\n\n\u201cI can tell you for certain that, in the late summer, fall, I was very concerned about what I was seeing, and this was on my front burner all throughout the pre-election period in August, September, October, and early November \u2014 to encourage the states to come in and seek our assistance,\u201d Johnson testified. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad that most of them, red and blue, did.\u201d\n\nIn the end, there was no evidence that votes were changed, Johnson told the House committee.\n\nTrump \u2014 as Democrats have done \u2014 can question whether the Obama administration did enough. That\u2019s an opinion. But Trump is wrong to say Obama \u201cdid nothing\u201d from early August to Nov. 8. In addition to directly raising the issue with Putin, Obama\u2019s administration worked with state officials to secure voting machines and issued a statement identifying Russia as the state actor behind the cyberattacks.", "lang": "en"}
