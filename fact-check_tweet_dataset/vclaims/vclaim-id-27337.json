Half of that is used for non-essential purposes \u2013 filling pools, watering gardens, washing cars and so forth.\u201d\n\nWith dams supplying the city currently only\n\n), are these reported consumption figures accurate? We set out to check.\n\nTo get the source of the statement, Africa Check spoke to the article\u2019s author, Lilly Wimberly. Wimberly told us the data was provided by councillor Xanthea Limberg\u2019s office.\n\nLimberg is the city\u2019s mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services, and energy. She gave Africa Check a breakdown of the city\u2019s water consumption patterns by category for the financial years 2015/16 and 2016/17.\n\n, the city was using\n\nThe city\u2019s water consumption data shows that residential units (69.9%) used the majority of supplied water. The bulk of this residential consumption was in formal settlements (64.5%), while informal settlements accounted for 3.6% of the consumption.\n\nBut how is this water use determined? Limberg explained to Africa Check that \u201cthe city has at least one meter [for] all formal developed stands and we have accurate information on the land use and land zoning of each stand therefore we are able to determine consumption levels per land use category\u201d.\n\n. He pointed us to a\n\nhe co-authored on the water saving achieved following water restrictions the City of Cape Town\n\nThe study compared individual water meter readings from the City of Cape Town\u2019s treasury system. Readings before water restrictions (1 October 2003 to 1 April 2004) and during water restrictions (1 October 2004 to 1 April 2005) were collected.\n\nThe researchers grouped their findings into four land use categories, namely residential (single standing dwellings), industrial, commercial and institutional, \u201cother\u201d (including group housing, flats and farmland) and \u201cunknown\u201d.\n\nThe study found that water use in the residential category accounted for 55.1% of total water use during the 2003/2004 period and 54.2% of total water use during the 2004/2005 period. (\n\nBecause of this, Jacobs notes that the 65% figure the City of Cape Town provides is \u201cplausible because we did not include flats in our sample set\u2026 [the city] lists \"flats and complexes\" as 9.2% and 9.5% of the total, so give or take a few minor errors I will believe the 65% without arguing about it\u201d.\n\nWhat exactly does the city consider as non-essential water use?\n\n\u201cWe regard outdoor water use as non-essential and we are allowing essential water use only for bathing, eating and drinking,\u201d Limberg told Africa Check. \u201cThe quantities of water required for outdoor purposes are on the whole much greater than quantities necessary for indoor functions.\u201d\n\nWe asked how the city measured the use of water within a residential setting. Limberg noted that the city had conducted \u201cvarious engineering research analyses and site studies to determine typical patterns of household water consumption in order to be able to collate such a breakdown\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe also make use of other national and international research to get guideline figures,\u201d Limberg added.\n\nAfrica Check asked for access to the research mentioned, but the city hasn\u2019t supplied it yet.\n\nJacobs told Africa Check that, on average, an individual will use between 100 litres to 250 litres of water per day. \u201cMost people will use 120 litres [per day] as a realistic low consumption for a house connection,\u201d he said.\n\nWith 69.9% of supplied water going to formal and informal residential units - or about 426.4 million litres per day - this would mean that the\n\nliving in the Cape Town metropolitan municipality consume, on average,\n\n\u201cThese numbers are very low, and one could argue that there is very little room for \u2018non-essential use\u2019 in these current numbers,\u201d Jacobs told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cBear in mind though that there is virtually no outdoor demand in winter in Cape Town, when it is raining and garden irrigation is minimized and swimming pools do not need topping up. Similarly, during water restrictions - as in our current situation - it can be assumed that all potable water consumption is for indoor purposes.\u201d\n\n, we highlighted that few studies have been conducted in South Africa to measure water end-use as they are expensive to run. One\n\n, found that 32 respondents surveyed via the internet - who were \u201clikely to be the higher income users\u201d - estimated using 37.6% of their total water consumption on watering their gardens.", "lang": "en"}
