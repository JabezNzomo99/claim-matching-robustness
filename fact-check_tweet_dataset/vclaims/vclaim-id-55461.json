Meili was not convicted of kidnapping the girl, and police statements suggest she voluntarily left her family home with him. Neither was Meili convicted of raping the girl.\n\nThompson was jailed for decades in relation to an incident in which he sold 3 pounds of marijuana. Meili was given five years' probation for an incident in which an 11-year-old girl claimed he engaged in sexual intercourse with her (statutory rape) and in which he admitted to molesting her. Though not definitive, further evidence exists that could reasonably lead an observer to conclude that he committed statutory rape.\n\nDisparities in prison sentences are a frequent subject of online memes and social media content, especially when one or both of the cases highlighted is regarded by some as a miscarriage of justice, or when racial basis is presented as an explanation for a relatively heavy punishment being imposed on an individual from a racial or ethnic minority group.\n\nWe have examined such memes on several occasions in the past. In September 2019, we received multiple inquiries about two more cases: that of Michigan resident Michael Alonzo Thompson, who is African American, and that of Missouri resident Joseph Robert Meili, who is white.\n\nOn Aug. 4, the Facebook page First People\u2019s Inter-Indigenous Network of the Americas posted a meme that showed Thompson\u2019s face on the left, along with the following text: \u201cThis man sold three pounds of weed in 1994 in Michigan, a state where it is now legal. He\u2019s still in prison to this day.\u201d Under Meili\u2019s face, on the right, the text stated: \u201cThis man kidnapped and raped an 11-year-old girl in Missouri. He was sentenced to probation.\u201d\n\nThe meme was originally posted in June 2019 by the left-leaning Facebook page The Other 98%. On the whole, it comprised a mixture of accurate and misleading claims.\n\nThe case of \u201cMeeko\u201d Thompson formed one half of a similar meme published previously by The Other 98%. An in-depth examination of his offenses and punishment can be found in our May 2019 fact check of that meme, but the following is a brief outline of the facts.\n\nIn 1996, Genesee District Court in Michigan sentenced the then-45-year-old to a combined total of between 40 and 60 years in prison. As of September 2019, Michigan Department of Corrections records show that Thompson was still incarcerated at Muskegon Correctional Facility, meaning The Other 98% meme was accurate in claiming \u201cHe is still in prison to this day.\u201d\n\nThompson was convicted of five charges: possession with intent to deliver marijuana; conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver marijuana; delivery of marijuana; possession of a weapon by a convicted felon; and possession of a weapon during the commission of a felony.\n\nThe Other 98% meme was therefore misleading in its description of Thompson\u2019s offenses, saying only that he had \u201csold three pounds of weed,\u201d and leaving out the fact that he had also been convicted on weapons charges. In fact, the relatively heavy prison sentence he received (the reason why he is \u201cstill in prison to this day\u201d) was not related to the three drug charges. For those offenses, Thompson was given a 15-year sentence, and he would have been released in 2011 if he had not also been convicted on weapons charges.\n\nIn fact, the statutory maximum penalty for those drug charges was four years in prison and a fine of up to $2,000. Thompson\u2019s sentence was increased to 15 years because he had already been convicted of three drug-related felonies dating back to the 1980s and therefore was charged under Michigan\u2019s \u201chabitual offender\u201d law.\n\nSimilarly, his sentence for possession of a weapon by a convicted felon was increased, under the habitual offender law, from five years in prison to between 40 and 60 years in prison, and it is that conviction and sentence alone that accounts for Thompson\u2019s continued incarceration as of 2019.\n\nThe two weapons-possession charges were rather controversial. Thompson never had a firearm on his person while he sold three pounds of marijuana to a police informant in 1994, and did not use or reach for a weapon at any time. Rather, he was convicted on the principle of \u201cconstructive possession.\u201d\n\nIn arresting Thompson, police found several firearms at his home, all of which Thompson\u2019s wife claimed to own. Despite this, the logic of constructive possession meant that, while the police informant was handing him $4,200 in cash for the marijuana, Thompson knew the whereabouts of the firearms and, in principle, he had them at his disposal. In the view of prosecutors and the court, this amounted to constructive possession, and Thompson could therefore be charged and convicted of possession by a felon and possession while committing a felony (the drug deal).\n\nUnder Michigan law, Thompson\u2019s status as an habitual offender meant the district court had lawful discretion to impose the 40- to 60-year sentence it ultimately imposed.\n\nIn March 2019, 22-year-old Meili pleaded guilty to one count of third-degree child molestation, which in Missouri, typically carries a potential penalty of up to seven years in prison. Three months later, Greene County Circuit Court judge Calvin Holden sentenced him to serve five years on probation for his crime. So The Other 98% meme was accurate in stating \u201che was sentenced to probation.\u201d\n\nMeili was originally charged with two additional offenses: first-degree statutory rape (which carries a potential penalty of between 10 years and life in prison) and child kidnapping (which also carries a potential penalty of between 10 years and life in prison). However, those charges were dropped as part of a plea agreement.\n\nTherefore, it cannot be stated unambiguously that Meili \u201ckidnapped\u201d an 11-year-old girl, as The Other 98% meme claims, because he was not convicted of that particular crime. Furthermore, according to police statements, the girl later told them she had agreed in advance to be picked up from her home by Meili. Notwithstanding her relative immaturity and limited decision-making capacity, the girl does appear to have entered the car voluntarily, in the expectation Meili would drive them away from her family home.\n\nThe following facts of the case are taken from Greene County Circuit Court records. They include descriptions of child sexual abuse and alleged statutory rape and might be upsetting to some readers.\n\nAlthough the evidence against Meili was never tested in a trial, because he pleaded guilty in return for two other charges being dropped, the following is how police officers in Springfield, Missouri, outlined their account of the events that led to Meili\u2019s arrest, taken from a felony probable-cause statement filed in September 2017:\n\nOn July 16, 2017, an 11-year-old girl was reported missing from her home in Republic, Missouri. She returned home at 9 p.m. that night and later told police she had been picked up from her house by then 21-year-old Meili, who took her to an apartment in nearby Springfield. During an interview, the girl told police she had begun chatting with Meili in the early hours of July 16, on an app called \u201cMeet Me,\u201d using her mother\u2019s cellphone. According to police, the girl told them that, in her \u201cMeet Me\u201d profile, she had listed her age as 18 years old, and not her true age of 11.\n\nShe gave Meili her family\u2019s address and he picked her up by car several hours later. According to the probable-cause statement, the girl\u2019s description of her text conversation with Meili was consistent with messages found on her mother\u2019s cellphone.\n\nThe girl told police she fell asleep at the apartment in Springfield and later awoke with \u201ca feeling something sexual had happened.\u201d Meili did not live in the apartment in question but had access to it because he had agreed to dogsit for his friend, who lived there.\n\nThe girl spoke to police again in August 2017 and provided further details about her encounter with Meili at the Springfield apartment the previous month. She told them Meili had removed her clothes and inserted his fingers and penis into her vagina. According to police, semen was found on her underwear.\n\nThe girl tested positive for the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia in August, having tested negative the day after her meeting with Meili in July. Given that chlamydia is estimated to take at least seven days to incubate, police came to the conclusion that \u201cit is probable [the girl] contracted chlamydia from [Meili].\u201d\n\nBefore his arrest, Meili insisted to police that he believed the girl to be 18 years old, as her \u201cMeet Me\u201d profile stated, rather than her true age of 11.\n\nUnder Missouri law, statutory rape is defined as \u201csexual intercourse with another person who is less than fourteen years of age.\u201d According to police, the girl told them that Meili had \u201cput a condom on his penis\u201d and then \u201cput his fingers and penis inside her vagina.\u201d Police later found a condom wrapper in the trash at Meili\u2019s friend\u2019s apartment, which the girl insisted she had no knowledge of.\n\nIf true, the act of intercourse the girl alleged would undoubtedly constitute statutory rape on Meili\u2019s part, and The Other 98% meme would be justified in claiming that he had \u201craped\u201d the girl. However, Meili was never convicted of statutory rape. Rather, the offense to which he admitted (third-degree child molestation) was described by prosecutors as follows:\n\n\u201c\u2026 The defendant subjected [the girl], who was then less than 14 years of age, to sexual contact, by placing his hand on [the girl\u2019s] vagina, for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of any person.\u201d\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Meili\u2019s plea bargain and his pleading guilty to the lesser charge of child molestation must be weighed against the allegation made by the girl to police (that Meili had indeed inserted his penis and fingers into her vagina), and the fact that the 11-year-old girl tested positive for chlamydia five weeks after the alleged intercourse.\n\nJudge Calvin Holden was not obliged to sentence Meil to only five years\u2019 probation. According to the Huffington Post, prosecutors in the case had asked for Meili to be imprisoned for the maximum term of seven years, but Holden imposed probation, instead. Unless Meili breaches any of the terms and conditions of his probation, he will never go to jail as a consequence of his actions.\n\nThe 40- to 60-year prison sentence imposed on Thompson is undoubtedly one that some observers would view as outrageously, even inhumanely, long. The Michigan Court of Appeals itself described it as \u201cquite severe.\u201d\n\nHowever, The Other 98% meme was misleading to readers because, while it\u2019s true Thompson received that sentence in relation to an incident in which he \u201csold three pounds of weed,\u201d the 40- to 60-year sentence was not based on that drug offense. Rather, he received that sentence because he was also convicted of \u201cpossession of a weapon by a convicted felon,\u201d and his prison term was multiplied because he was already a thrice-convicted felon in the state of Michigan.\n\nIt is a matter of subjective opinion as to whether those facts justify the sentence imposed upon Thompson, but they are undoubtedly highly relevant facts that the meme markedly failed to mention.\n\nSimilarly, Holden\u2019s decision to ignore the wishes of prosecutors and suspend Meili\u2019s five-year sentence for molesting an 11-year-old girl, when the maximum sentence available was seven years in prison, would undoubtedly strike some readers as unjustifiable and unjust.\n\nHowever, The Other 98% meme went further and used two specific terms to describe Meili\u2019s actions, alleging that he \u201ckidnapped and raped\u201d the girl. Although Meili was initially charged with kidnapping, that charge was dropped as part of his plea bargain, and notwithstanding her immaturity and young age, the girl does appear to have agreed to meet Meili, and voluntarily left her family home in the car he was driving, according to police statements.\n\nWhile it cannot be claimed definitively that Meili raped the girl, and a charge of statutory rape was dropped, the meme is on somewhat less shaky factual ground here. Firstly, the girl reportedly told police that Meili had penetrated her vagina with his penis, which would be statutory rape. Secondly, semen was found on the girl\u2019s underwear just one day after her meeting with Meili. Thirdly, the 11-year-old girl tested positive for chlamydia, five weeks after the meeting with Meili, during which she alleged he had sexually penetrated her, and during which he later admitted to having molested her.\n\nWhile those facts do not amount to definitive proof, and it must be emphasized again that Meili was never convicted of statutory rape, it is understandable that some observers, including those who created The Other 98% meme, might come to the conclusion that he had, in fact, raped her.\n\nOn the whole, the meme was comprised of a mixture of accurate and misleading claims.", "lang": "en"}
