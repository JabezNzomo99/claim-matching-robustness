Each of them has a disclaimer that says, \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d However, the story has been picked up and reposted by several other sites that include no such disclaimer.\n\nFacebook users flagged the story as being potentially false. It is.\n\nThe story starts out with a reference to the so-called \u201cpizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory, which spread the fiction that Democratic Party heavyweights, including the Clintons, were running a pedophile ring in the basement of the Comet Ping Pong pizza shop in Washington, D.C. That hoax drove Edgar Maddison Welch to show up at the shop with an AR-15 rifle.\n\nThe story also includes a made-up quote from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s office that links to a Mr. Potato Head meme that says: \u201cDID YOU ALL TAKE STUPID PILLS THIS MORNING?\u201d\n\nAnother clue that the story isn\u2019t true is the author\u2019s bio, which shows a stock photo of a woman in lingerie wielding a pistol in each hand. We\u2019ve written about this before.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nSamuelson, Kate. \u201cWhat to Know About Pizzagate, the Fake News Story With Real Consequences.\u201d Time. 5 Dec 2016.\n\nWelch, Edgar Maddison.
