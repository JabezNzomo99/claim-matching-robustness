{"title": "Is This Teen Activist Greta Thunberg Shooting a Gun?", "subtitle": "Time magazine's 2019 Person of the Year has been the subject of numerous false rumors.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2019-12-12T15:13:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-42037", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/greta-thunberg-shooting-a-gun/", "vclaim": "This video racked up more than 1 million views within a few days of its initial posting. It was circulated both by people who found that it was out of character for Thunberg, a \u201cleftist\u201d who is fighting against climate change, and by those who found Thunberg doubly threatening when wielding a gun.\n\nThis video, however, does not show the 16-year-old Swedish girl but rather a Twitter user named \u201cEmmy.\u201d\n\nEmmy (@eslinge) posted this video to her Twitter page on Dec. 7, 2019, a few days before anyone claimed that this footage featured Thunberg, along with the caption \u201cSo anyway, I started blasting.\u201d Emmy then shared a second video of her shooting this weapon:\n\nSeveral people commented on Emmy\u2019s videos, saying that she looked like Thunberg. Emmy responded to one person, writing: \u201cF\u00f6rsta g\u00e5ngen jag fick h\u00f6ra det blev jag vansinnig men nu k\u00e4nns det n\u00e4stan lite charmigt att vara lik henne. :D\u201d translated as: \u201cThe first time I heard it, I got crazy but now it feels almost a little charming to be like her. : D.\u201d\n\nEmmy told the AFP that she was about 15 years older than Thunberg. She also said that she hopes \u201cpeople don\u2019t really think that I am her. I don\u2019t want to cause Greta any harm, I think she\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nEmmy has also posted several articles from international news outlets that have also debunked this claim.\n\nIn short, this video does not show environmental activist Greta Thunberg shooting a gun but a Twitter user named Emmy.", "lang": "en"}
