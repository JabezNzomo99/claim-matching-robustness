{"title": "BBC Question Time did not hire the son of a producer to say pro-Brexit statements", "subtitle": "The claim was spread by a now-deleted tweet.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-32593", "url": "https://fullfact.org/online/question-time-actor/", "vclaim": "BBC Question Time did not hire the son of a producer to say pro-Brexit statements\n\nThe claim that BBC Question Time hired the son of a BBC producer to pose as a Brexit and Boris Johnson supporter has been shared hundreds of times of Facebook.\n\nThis is incorrect. The claim originates with a now-deleted tweet from a spoof account, which said that BBC producer Rob Burley had hired and dressed up a member of the Conservative party to appear \u201cworking class\u201d and make comments that were pro-Brexit and pro-Boris Johnson on Question Time.\n\nSome people seem to have believed the tweet, and the claim then morphed into the accusation that the man was Mr Burley\u2019s son. Burley has denied this and stated that he has no involvement with Question Time (he is the BBC\u2019s editor for live political programmes, which does not include Question Time). The show\u2019s actual current editor is Hilary O\u2019Neil, and the man in the video has identified himself as Layton J Smith.\n\nA separate Facebook post claiming that the man is an \u201cactor\u201d, with a screenshot of his profile on a casting website, is accurate in the sense that the profile was real (although it has since been deleted). However, the possible implication that Mr Smith\u2019s beliefs are not genuinely held is not borne out by his social media accounts, which appear to be authentic and demonstrate a history of support for Brexit.", "lang": "en"}
