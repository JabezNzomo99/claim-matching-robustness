Gen. Steve Townsend, commander of Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF\u2013OIR), said the fight for Raqqa would be \u201clong and difficult\u201d but would deliver a \u201cdecisive blow to the idea of ISIS as a physical caliphate.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convince new recruits that ISIS is a winning cause when they just lost their twin \u2018capitals\u2019 in both Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\nThree days after the Raqqa offensive started, the commander of the Russian troops stationed in Syria, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, accused the U.S. and Syrian Democratic Forces of colluding with IS.\n\nCiting \u201cavailable reliable information,\u201d the Russian commander said that \u201cin early June ISIL terrorists entered into collusion with the command of the Kurdish armed units, which are part of the Democratic Forces Union, left the populated localities of Tadia and al-Hamam located 19 kilometers southwest of Raqqa offering no resistance and headed toward Palmyra.\"\n\nMultiple sources have reported that the Syrian Democratic Forces have successfully carried out attacks north, east and west of Raqqa, while the areas south of the city remain under IS control.\n\nIn light of those reports, the Russian commander\u2019s statement that the Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by the U.S., granted IS forces safe passage through territory they do not control does not appear credible.\n\nIn an email to Polygraph.info, the Kurdish forces\u2019 press office dismissed Russia\u2019s allegations as untrue.\n\n\u201cThe alleged news from an official of the Russian Defense Ministry is far from the truth and aims at distorting the reputation of Syrian Democratic Forces,\u201d said People's Protection Units (YPG) spokesman Nuri Mehmud. \u201cWe at the frontlines announce that our fight against IS thugs is continuing despite all the difficulties. We ask those who make those claims to release their evidence to the public.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Central Command, the Syrian Democratic Forces have \u201cencouraged civilians to depart Raqqah so that they do not become trapped, used as human shields or become targets for ISIS snipers.\u201d\n\nThese safety precautions aimed at reducing civilian casualties have been undermined by the ferocity with which Islamic State continues to fight to hold on to Raqqa despite Russian allegations that IS terrorists are leaving their territory without putting up a fight.\n\n\u201cThis ranks as quintessential Kremlin disinformation,\u201d Brian Williams, author of the book \u201cCounter Jihad: America's Military Experience in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria,\u201d told Polygraph.info. \u201cAll reports on the ground are that ISIS is still diligent at defending Raqqa ferociously.\u201d\n\nBoth the Pentagon and Operation Inherent Resolve U.S. Central Command told Polygraph.info that allegations the United States would collaborate with Islamic State have no basis in the truth.\n\nResponding to the Russian commander\u2019s claim that IS terrorists were given safe passage to continue fighting Syrian government forces, a CJTF\u2013Operation Inherent Resolve spokesperson told Polygaph.info via email that the U.S.-led coalition \u201cdoes not seek to fight Syrian regime, Russian or pro-regime forces partnered with them\u201d\n\nStill, the spokesperson said: \u201cThe demonstrated hostile intent and actions of pro-regime forces near Coalition and partner forces in southern Syria, however, continue to concern us and the Coalition will take appropriate measures to protect our forces.\u201d\n\nThe CJTF\u2013OIR spokesperson added: \u201cThe Coalition calls on all parties to focus their efforts in the same direction -- to defeat ISIS, which is our common enemy and the greatest threat to regional and worldwide peace and security.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
