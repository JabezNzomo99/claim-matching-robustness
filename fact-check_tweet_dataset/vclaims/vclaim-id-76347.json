The senior senator already said he\u2019s skipping July\u2019s Republican National Convention in Cleveland to campaign for this sixth term.\n\nHis challengers include fellow Republican Kelli Ward and U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz. The primary is scheduled for Aug. 30.\n\nWe came across an advertisement attacking Kirkpatrick, which comes from the Arizona Grassroots Action Political Action Committee.\n\n\"She votes with her party nearly 90 percent of the time,\" the ad states, as the graphic shows Kirkpatrick and President Barack Obama side by side.\n\nAlthough the PAC\u2019s ad says it is not authorized by any candidate or committee, they\u2019ve taken a pro-McCain stance, spending wise, in this Senate race.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the PAC has spent $211,547 against Ward in the last two weeks. They\u2019ve also spent $45,050 supporting McCain.\n\nBut what about Kirkpatrick and her voting record?\n\nWe reached out to the PAC and did not hear back. Still, the ad\u2019s claim checks out based on the numbers we found.\n\nAccording to CQ Roll Call, which tracks and analyzes congressional data, Kirkpatrick sided with her party 88 percent of the time in 2014 and 84 percent in 2013. Although, her support of Obama was 76 percent in 2014 and 77 percent in 2013.\n\nCQ defines \"presidential support\" as voting in agreement with the president\u2019s position.\n\nWe reached out to the Kirkpatrick campaign, and spokesman D.B. Mitchell did provide us with several examples of the congresswoman voting against party lines.\n\nIn June 2015, Kirkpatrick was one of only eight Democrats to vote for the Ratepayer Protection Act, which would have delayed compliance with carbon dioxide emissions for states. It passed with support from 239 Republicans.\n\nAnd in 2009, she voted against the American Clean Energy and Securities Act, which would have allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to set greenhouse gas limits (211 Democrats voted for it).\n\nFinally, we should note that, historically, most members of Congress vote along party lines, and the partisan divide has worsened in the last 60 years.\n\nThe Arizona Grassroots PAC said that Kirkpatrick \"votes with her party nearly 90 percent of the time.\"\n\nThe data backs up this claim. However, her campaign can point to a couple of instances where Kirkpatrick did cross party lines on votes.\n\nWe rate the ad as Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
