It also says that she called for one herself back in 2008 and provides a video of this.\n\nIt is correct that Ms Swinson said she didn\u2019t forgive former-Prime Minister David Cameron for calling the EU referendum in 2016. At the Liberal Democrats party conference this week she said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t forgive David Cameron for calling the referendum.\n\n\u201cI think so much of the problems that we are facing right now, stem from David Cameron\u2019s shocking misjudgement in putting the interests of the Conservative Party ahead of the national interest.\u201d\n\nAs the video in the Facebook post shows, Ms Swinson also said in 2008 that \u201cthe Liberal Democrats would like to have a referendum on the major issue of whether we are in or out of Europe.\u201d This quote is also recorded in Hansard, the record of all parliamentary proceedings.\n\nAt the time, the Liberal Democrats supported a referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EU. The position was stated by other colleagues including then-party leader Nick Clegg, and was also included in the party\u2019s 2010 election manifesto.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe European Union has evolved significantly since the last public vote on membership over thirty years ago.\n\n\u201cLiberal Democrats therefore remain committed to an in/out referendum the next time a British government signs up for fundamental change in the relationship between the UK and the EU.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s position was that it was in favour of remaining in the EU at such a referendum.", "lang": "en"}
