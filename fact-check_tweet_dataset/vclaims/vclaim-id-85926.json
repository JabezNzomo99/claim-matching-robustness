This was a huge increase from a previous estimate , but it was widely misinterpreted by both the news media and Republican operatives. Some jobs will go away, but the actual number is unclear because of the unknown interaction between part-time and full-time work. Analysts can make a credible case that this is still a negative \u2014 just as advocates for the law can claim the law gives people the option not to work.\n\nThis was one of a series of columns that looked at the claims in ads sponsored by the pro-GOP group Americans for Prosperity. All of them had various issues in terms of facts and context. In this case, Michigan resident Julia Boonstra left the impression that she lost her doctor when her insurance was canceled (she did not) and claimed that her new insurance left her with \u201cunaffordable\u201d out-of-pocket costs. But she did not say that her premium was cut in half \u2014 and that savings from that would cover her out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n3: Issa\u2019s \u2018suspicions\u2019 that Hillary Clinton told Panetta to \u2018stand down\u2019 on Benghazi\n\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, earned Four Pinocchios for claiming that then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton ordered Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to \u201cstand down\u201d his troops and not try to rescue Americans during a 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. Every congressional report, including by House Republicans, has debunked claims of a \u201cstand-down\u201d order.\n\n4: Obama\u2019s claim that 7 million got \u2018access to health care for the first time\u2019 because of his Medicaid expansion\n\nThe president erred badly in claiming that 7 million people had received access to health care for the first time because of the health law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. The administration\u2019s Medicaid figures are complex and obscure, but no matter how you slice it, there is no way someone can claim that all 7 million on the list are getting health care for the first time. Many people simply reenlisted in the program. Analysts aren\u2019t sure but believe the real number of people getting health care for the first time, because of the expansion of the law, ranges between 1.1 million and 3.3 million people.\n\nThis was a controversial column, as some readers believed The Fact Checker took too narrow a view of the term \u201csexual predator\u201d (we used the dictionary definition). In any case, we concluded that Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) fell short because we only found three accusations that would fit that definition. But we also found plenty of evidence of documented consensual relationships involving former president Bill Clinton.", "lang": "en"}
