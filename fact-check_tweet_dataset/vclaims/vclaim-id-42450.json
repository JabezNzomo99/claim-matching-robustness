The headline on the flyer, with a grammatical error, says: \"Do no open your door!!!\" Below it are illustrations of two people in hazmat suits.\n\nThe flyer says people in hazmat suits are going door to door in Stockton, California, posing as health department officials who want to check the temperatures of residents or check them for COVID-19. \"They will enter your home and physically attempt robbery, or they may ask you important personal information to steal your identity,\" the poster says.\n\nStockton, in California\u2019s Central Valley, has a population of more than 300,000.\n\nThe flyer advises people to call Stockton police if they witness such a scam. The phone number listed is the main non-emergency number for the department. In smaller print at the bottom of the poster, it reads \"Thank you \u2014 Courtyards Management and Staff.\" It is dated March 18, 2020.\n\nThe image was posted on Facebook the next day by a person who wrote: \"This is happening in Stockton.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But several of the online posts warning about robbers going door to door in various cities have proven to be just rumors.\n\nSo, why are such posts being made, and shared?\n\nMany social media users respond to news that brings \"high levels of anxiety and fear,\" said Niklas Myhr, a marketing and economics professor at Chapman University in Orange, California, who calls himself the social media professor. \"Their motives could range from a genuine willingness to help those in need, to more opportunistic ones such as taking advantage of emotionally vulnerable people.\"\n\nThe algorithms of social media platforms \"quickly pick up on signals of content being engaging and makes it more available in broader circles,\" Myrh said.\n\nThe person who posted the flyer image on Facebook told PolitiFact that he did so after a friend sent him a picture of the flyer; the friend had seen the flyer on the door of a house he was working on.\n\n\"Anyone in their right mind would do the same thing as a precaution to protect others from harm,\" he said via Facebook Messenger.\n\nA Facebook post shows an image of a flyer claiming that people wearing hazmat suits are offering coronavirus tests as a ruse to get in homes and rob people in Stockton, Calif.\n\nPolice in Stockton say they\u2019ve received no such reports.", "lang": "en"}
