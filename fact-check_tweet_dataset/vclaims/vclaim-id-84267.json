The bridge is actually in Kenya and was still under construction when the photo was taken.\n\nOne Facebook post, which we\u2019ve archived here, has been shared more than 3,000 times and shows an image of what looks like a basic unpaved bridge. The misspelt meme says \u201cThis is an officiall bridge opening in Qwaqwa it cost 11 million\u2026..can someone explain\u201d.\n\nQwaqwa is a former Bantustan or homeland in the eastern part of central South Africa and forms part of the Free State province.\n\nThe Facebook user captions the post: \u201cANC delivers\u201d, includes laughing emoticons and tells followers to make their vote count ahead of the South African elections -- which were two weeks away at the time of the post in April.\n\nBut a reverse image search of the photo leads to an article published last year on the Kenyan news website Kenyans.co.ke which locates the footbridge in Machakos county, south of the country\u2019s capital Nairobi.\n\nIt names the source of the image as Twitter and says that the photo shows Machakos governor, Alfred Mutua, inspecting progress on the bridge while on the way to an event for solar-powered boreholes.\n\nMutua told the publication that the bridge was a \u201csimple box culvert\u201d only halfway done, for a contract of less than one million rand.\n\nThe story contains elements of a tweet by a parody account, AdvBarryRoux, criticizing the launch of an alleged $6 million bridge.\n\nThat tweet reached the First Lady to the governor, Lilian Nganga, who replied in two tweets: One showing the bridge before and another saying work on the bridge was ongoing.\n\nKenyan blogger Abraham Mutai also replied from his verified Twitter account that the governor was inspecting it rather than launching the box culvert (a tunnel structure that provides a passage over water or an obstruction). Mutai added that governors in Kenya attract crowds everywhere they go.\n\nA Google search \u201cQwaqwa 6 million bridge\u201d reveals an article dated October 5, 2011, about repairs to three bridges in South Africa that had been damaged during floods in 2010, reportedly costing 11 million rand -- another element that appeared in the false posts.\n\nIn Kenya, AFP spoke to Machakos county engineer Gregory Mutuku who was in charge of the construction of the box culvert.\n\nMutuku told AFP that the project actually cost around $32,838. He said there were also plans to improve the road around the project, but that would be a separate contract.\n\n\"We are planning to work on the approaches to the box culvert since it was not part of the contract. Also planned for implementation is improvement of the entire road into gravel standards,\" he said in a WhatsApp message.\n\nA seasonal river flows through the area and locals previously used a makeshift bridge to access churches, the market and a school.\n\nA local government official who escorted AFP to the location, Alex Muthiini Gideon, said that school children used to miss classes when it rained as flooding would make the area inaccessible.", "lang": "en"}
