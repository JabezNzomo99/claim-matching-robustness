Will Hurd of Texas, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Fred Upton of Michigan and Susan Brooks of Indiana voted to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWANTED OUT OF OFFICE \u2026 for obstructing progress,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nTo date, there has been no House vote to impeach Trump. Hurd, Upton, Brooks and Fitzpatrick have all expressed, to some extent, opposition to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi announced in late September that the House would initiate an impeachment inquiry into Trump. The announcement came after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 15,000 times, alleges that four Republican members of Congress voted to impeach the president. \u201cWill Hurd, Fred Upton, Susan Brooks and Brian Fitzpatrick,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cRemember these faces next election!\u201d\n\nThere has, however, been no House vote to impeach the president to date, making it impossible for the four Republicans mentioned in the Facebook post to have voted in favor of such a motion. In fact, the House only just passed a resolution formalizing the procedures of the impeachment inquiry into Trump on Oct. 31.\n\nThe resolution passed largely along party lines \u2013 232-196 \u2013 with two Democrats voting against it. Hurd, Upton, Brooks and Fitzpatrick all voted against it, along with the rest of the House Republicans, according to Fox News. (RELATED: Did Vermont Gov.
