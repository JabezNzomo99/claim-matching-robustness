And he regularly makes false and misleading claims about immigration and the wall. The disease is already in the United States, and experts say containment measures are needed inside the country at this stage.\n\nTrump claimed twice that a wall along the southern border would help mitigate the coronavirus from spreading in the United States, first at a campaign rally and then in a tweet quoting a right-wing activist, who wrote: \u201cNow, more than ever, we need the wall. With China Virus spreading across the globe, the US stands a chance if we can control of our borders.\u201d\n\nBut none of the coronavirus cases reported in the United States have been linked to people who entered through the U.S.-Mexico border. According to U.S. officials and experts, travelers who arrived on airplanes and cruise ships contracted the virus overseas and began to spread it after entering the country. On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced a ban on foreign travelers from most of Europe for 30 days, following previous restrictions on travel from China and Iran.\n\nHours after Trump\u2019s tweet, Rep. Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.) asked at a House hearing whether \u201cstructural barriers at our border would be of any use in mitigating the outbreak of this virus.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) declined to comment and deferred to the White House \u201cfor clarification or further explanation\u201d of Trump\u2019s tweets. White House officials did not respond to our query.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the United States had recorded more than 1,000 cases of coronavirus; Canada had nearly 100 and Mexico eight. Public-health experts say Trump\u2019s claim is off is because the coronavirus has already entered the United States.\n\n\u201cThe virus originated in China and was never coming from Mexico. And now, it\u2019s already here,\u201d said Joshua M. Sharfstein, vice dean and professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cThe real threat at the moment is spread in detention centers where the migrants are at risk from contracting the disease here.\u201d\n\nHe said CBP officials should implement infection-control measures at the border and added \u201cthe agency has yet to implement influenza vaccination, despite three deaths of kids in part from influenza last year and despite the recommendation to vaccinate from CDC.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reported \u201cthe best way to prevent a catastrophic explosion of cases in the next few weeks, many experts think, is to break potential chains of transmission by preventing infected people from coming in close contact with healthy ones, whether it means canceling conferences or relying on individual decisions to avoid crowded public transportation or postpone weddings.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
