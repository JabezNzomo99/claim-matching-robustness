The report prompted a news story in The Wall Street Journal \u2014 \u201cInsurers Doing Well, White House Says, Raising ACA Subsidy Doubts\u201d \u2014 and apparently played a role in lawmakers deciding not to add the money for CSRs to the bill.\n\nFirst of all, one oddity of the CEA report is that it suggests that the ACA marketplaces are relatively stable, contrary to the president\u2019s frequent suggestion that Obamacare is collapsing. The report also noted that 85 percent of exchange buyers received a subsidy that shields them from premium increases \u2013 a fact that the president never mentions \u2013 and that \u201cmany lower-income, able-bodied, working-age adults gained Medicaid coverage.\u201d But the report takes these positive facts and claims that the law thus has been a boon to insurance-company bottom lines.\n\n\u201cCEA created an index of health insurers participating and not participating in ACA exchange and Medicaid plans; our financial software reports healthcare or insurance indices and there is no way to separate the two in the data we have access to,\u201d the White House official said, conceding that the report covers a \u201ca time period when some publicly traded insurers still offered plans on the exchange.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the tip for the CEA: There\u2019s a federal agency called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS governs all the exchanges not run by the states, and insurers have to file a notice every year that they are offering coverage on the exchanges and file their \u201cqualified health plans\u201d with CMS; they even have information on state-based exchanges. A simple phone call would turn up a list. (Kaiser Family Foundation used this CMS data to create an interactive map.)\n\nThe White House official pointed to an article in Politico that said an analysis indicated that insurers in 2017 started making money on the exchanges. The article looked at the filings of 29 regional Blue Cross Blue Shields plan with a simple formula of gross premium receipts minus medical claims. This it is not same as the \u201cmedical loss ratio,\u201d in which 80 cents of every premium in has to be spent on medical care with the other 20 percent spent on administrative expenses (including cost of processing claims), federal, state and local taxes, all salaries, marketing, and so forth.\n\nLet\u2019s recall that this CEA report was intended to rebut the need for cost-sharing reductions. Here\u2019s a line from the Politico report: \u201cPatrick Conway, CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, points out his company would have kept 2018 premiums flat if Trump hadn\u2019t eliminated the cost-sharing subsidy. Instead, the insurer jacked up rates by an average of 13 percent to make up for the lost funding.\u201d\n\nThe ACA required insurance companies to offer plans with reduced deductibles and co-pays for lower-income Americans with the understanding that the federal government would make up the difference. Insurance companies do not make money through the cost-sharing provision, estimated to be worth about $7 billion in fiscal 2017. They\u2019re being paid back for money they\u2019ve already spent. When Trump stopped the payments, companies responded by raising premiums, mainly in the benchmark silver plans.\n\nThe White House official argued that this move had bolstered the stability of the market: \u201cMany health reform experts have noted that the ACA exchanges are becoming more stable as insurers have significantly raised premiums on people who are largely insensitive to the premium spikes because of the tax credit structure, and as many markets only have one or two insurers and thus little, if any, competition.\u201d\n\n[Note: After this fact check appeared, a White House official insisted it incorrectly suggested the administration was opposed to funding the CRSs. He pointed to a statement issued by the White House as well as a news article saying the president told lawmakers he was supportive. People involved in the debate tell a different story, saying the White House was inconsistent and confused in its approach, offering little leadership to ensure passage. The CEA report might be seen as part of this pattern. The official also faulted this fact check for not devoting more attention to the money earned by insurance companies by the Medicaid expansion. He pointed to an article in the Los Angeles Times that focused on the profits made in California by Centene and Anthem \u2014 profits that the state says it will take back in coming years.]\n\nThe CEA report may have had its intended political impact, but as economic analysis it does not stand up to scrutiny. The improved stock prices of a handful of companies that are no longer in Obamacare is not a useful proxy for the companies still in the market, where many continue to lose money. The report is worthy of Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
