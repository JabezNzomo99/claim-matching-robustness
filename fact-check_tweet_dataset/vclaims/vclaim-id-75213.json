The tweet also claimed 25 passengers were injured.\n\nWe contacted Jet Airways and alerted them about the video circulating on Twitter. They denied any such incident had taken place and said they will issue a statement.\n\nA source at the Mumbai airport said that this video could have been shot several weeks back when the airport conducted a mock drill. The source pointed out that the aircraft in question is not a real one but a model used in mock drills.\n\nInterestingly, even before Jet Airways got into action, some twitterrati had already pointed out it is an old video.\n\nWhile such videos can go viral weeks after it was originally shot, what stood out about this tweet was the precise number of people injured in the mishap. This is usually a figure airlines would give out hours after an incident has occurred.\n\nBOOM will fact check and bust fake news.
