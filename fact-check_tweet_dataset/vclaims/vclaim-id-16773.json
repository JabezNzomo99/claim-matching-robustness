That\u2019s set to fall to 19% in April 2017, and 17% in April 2020.\n\nUS corporation tax rates are about 39%, on average according to the OECD, so about twice that paid in the UK. The exact rate of corporation tax varies between states.\n\nCompanies pay tax in the country where they locate their business, rather than the place where they make their sales. For example, a UK car manufacturer who sold cars in the United States would pay the UK rate to the UK government.\n\nCorporation tax isn\u2019t the only tax paid by UK businesses.", "lang": "en"}
