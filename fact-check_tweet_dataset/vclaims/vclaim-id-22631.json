A separate bill that would criminalize false rape allegations was introduced, but it would not legislate the binary outcome suggested in the meme \u2013 that either the accuser or the accused ends up in jail.\n\nThe national debate over abortion recently turned to Alabama, where a bill banning abortion in nearly all cases was passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday.\n\nSponsored by state Rep. Terri Collins, a synopsis of the bill says that it will \u201cmake abortion and attempted abortion felony offenses except in cases where abortion is necessary in order to prevent a serious health risk to the unborn child\u2019s mother.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet subsequently screenshot and shared on Facebook, one person claimed that the bill included \u201can extra tacked on to the end\u201d that could lead to the imprisonment of women reporting rape cases. (The original tweet has since been deleted.)\n\nThere is, however, no such \u201cextra\u201d added to the abortion bill, which itself does not mandate jail time or criminal culpability to women receiving abortions. The felony charges only apply to doctors performing abortions, with the bill summary explaining that \u201ca woman who receives an abortion will not be held criminally culpable or civilly liable for receiving the abortion.\u201d\n\nRape is not mentioned in the text of the bill, and the majority leader\u2019s office for the Alabama Senate told The Daily Caller in an email that the abortion bill \u201csays absolutely nothing about rape.\u201d\n\nAn amendment to allow exceptions for cases of rape or incest was proposed but not ultimately included in the final bill. The bill only allows abortions to protect the mother\u2019s health or if lethal fetal anomalies are found.\n\nAn unrelated bill in the Alabama legislature does attempt to criminalize false rape allegations. Proposed the other week, it would classify a false report of rape, sodomy or sexual torture made \u201cwillfully, knowingly, and with malicious intent\u201d as a Class C felony, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. The accuser may be liable for the accused\u2019s legal fees.\n\nNonetheless, the meme mischaracterizes the bill, claiming that \u201ceither he winds up in jail or you do.\u201d An acquittal in a rape trial would not send the accuser to jail. Only if the accuser was prosecuted separately for filing a false report \u201cwith malicious intent\u201d would the bill come into play.\n\n\u201cA not guilty verdict does not indicate false reporting and the accuser is not charged with false reporting,\u201d state Rep. Dickie Drake, who introduced the bill, told the Caller in an email.\n\nFiling a false police report is already illegal in Alabama, though it is currently a Class A misdemeanor.", "lang": "en"}
