There is no credible evidence supporting this claim.\n\nThe full claim in the posts reads: \u201cIf that fuckin bastard wins, we\u2019re all going to hang from nooses! You better fix this shit! \u2013 Hillary Clinton, email to Donna Brazile, DNC Chair, October 17, 2016.\u201d\n\nRecent iterations of this claim are visible here , here , here , here and here .\n\nAccording to Snopes ( here ), this claim is a slightly different iteration of another false quote contained in a \u201cbaseless\u201d 2016 article, visible here .\n\nThe article, entitled \u201cTemper! Temper! Hillary Goes On Rampage For Over An Hour- Throwing Glass at Staffer\u2019s Head\u201d, was posted on September 9, 2016 \u2013 two days after NBC\u2019s \u201cCommander-in-Chief\u201d forum, in which host Matt Lauer interviewed candidates Clinton and Trump and was widely criticized for putting tough questions to her while going easy on him ( here and here ).\n\nIn a passage appearing to cite Politico, the article quotes Clinton as saying Trump would \u201chave us swinging from nooses\u201d if he won the election. However, the linked Politico piece contains no such quote.\n\nThe apparently fabricated quote has been debunked repeatedly by fact-checkers, for example here and here .\n\nFalse. There is no evidence to suggest Hillary Clinton ever said this in an email.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
