The tweet also claimed that the area was tense but that local police were deployed to protect Muslims in the area.\n\nThe tweet was accompanied by a horrific video showing the cow profusely bleeding from the mouth walking around in pain.\n\nWARNING: The below video is graphic is nature. Some readers might find it distressing.\n\nAt the time of writing this story, ShankhNaad's tweet garnered a staggering 45,900 views, close to 1900 Likes and over 4,600 Retweets. Most of the reactions were of shock and outrage.\n\nHowever, Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Bhupendra Singh said that initial investigations by local police did not point to any communal mischief. Singh even quoted ShankhNaad's tweet and clarified that the cow had accidentally chewed a crude bomb kept in the bushes by local tribal boys to hunt wild boars.\n\nDespite the minister's clarification, not wanting to give up the anti-Muslim rhetoric, a defiant ShankNaad without any shred of evidence tweeted that tribals had placed the bomb to kill pigs, but it was 'some peaceful Jihadi' who fed the bomb to the cow.\n\nFurthermore the account claimed a cover-up by MP police and local leaders to protect the Muslim community.\n\nAccording to a December 11 news report by local Hindi newspaper Nai Dunia, the incident took place at Ahmedpur Road in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh. The cow which was wandering the streets by itself, reached the spot where it started feeding on stuff kept near few roadside shops. It also chewed the bomb which was kept in a bag after which the bomb exploded and the cow got injured.\n\nThe article says people gathered to the spot on hearing the explosion. However, police reached the spot and the situation was under control. Later in the day, members of the Bajrang Dal assembled at the spot demanding action against those responsible. News reports have not mentioned anything about the state of the injured cow.\n\nThis is corroborated by Hindi factchecking site the Lallantop.com - \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e\u094b\u0902 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0917\u093e\u092f \u0915\u094b \u092c\u092e \u0916\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0935\u094b \u0939\u0915\u0940\u0915\u0924 \u091c\u094b \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092c\u0924\u093e\u0908 \u0917\u0908\n\nShankhNaad has been on Twitter since April 2012 and has a following of over 19,000 followers. Although the account's bio claims it is about 'Activism | Nationalism | Dharma' every tweet appears designed to incite hatred against people of other faiths.\n\nLike other fact-checkers, BOOM has debunked fake news peddled by this handle in the past (No, Muslims Did Not Vandalise Swami Vivekananda\u2019s Statue In UP)", "lang": "en"}
