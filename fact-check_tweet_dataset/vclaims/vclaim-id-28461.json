A part of the passage reads, \u201cEvery fascist regime needs communities and groups it can demonize in order to thrive. It starts with one group or two. But it never ends there.\u201d\n\nTwitter user Aparna (@chhuti_is) was one of the firsts to tweet the alleged screenshot. This was within 10 minutes of Sana posting the story.\n\nThe BCCI chief, while requesting people to keep his daughter out of issues, wrote, \u201cThis post is not true.\u201d His claim, however, was found to be false.\n\nAparna wasn\u2019t the only user who posted a screenshot of Sana\u2019s Instagram story. It was shared by multiple users and these screenshots were taken at different times. Hence, they were unique. Instagram story feature allows a user to upload content that self-deletes after 24 hours. Stories are not a part of a user\u2019s regular feed. Moreover, the \u2018blue-tick\u2019 which is a verified badge confirming the authenticity of a profile does not show on stories. It only appears against the user\u2019s name on her homepage and against her regular posts. However, unlike regular posts from public profiles that appear on a user\u2019s \u2018Explore\u2019 section, stories can only be viewed upon visiting a person\u2019s account.\n\nTwitter user Mano (@mano_reports) took a screenshot after Sana\u2019s story was live for three hours.\n\nAnother user posted a screenshot taken after 6 hours and wrote, \u201cThe best thing about this generation is, they don\u2019t fear! They will express their ideas and emotions without fear of power, muscle and social pressure. Kudos Sana Ganguly for this moving post. Many people who were silent for last 5-6 years are finally speaking up. #CAA_NRC\u201c\n\nAlt News contacted a few users to corroborate that the screenshots were indeed taken by them. Aparna told us, \u201cThis was noticed by some of my friends. I am not on Instagram but my husband is. So I went and checked the story from my husband\u2019s account and took a screenshot. I applauded her maturity for reading and quoting from such a book.\u201d\n\nAparna also shared with us another screenshot of Sana\u2019s story which provides context to her previous story on Kushwant Singh\u2019s book. She had posted a map of student protests against CAA across the country.\n\nWe also spoke with Arijeet Mukherjee whose Twitter username is @SaintIGNUtius. Arijit had commented on Sourav Ganguly\u2019s tweet calling Sana\u2019s post \u201cnot true\u201d. He wrote, \u201cDear Dada \u2013 many like me actually verified the insta story. So there\u2019s no \u201cnot true\u201d there however hard you try. And I don\u2019t believe that an 18 yr old cannot understand what\u2019s going on. I myself am a father of one. I\u2019d hv been proud. Or is it the lure of the chair?\u201d\n\nArijit had not posted the screenshot he took on social media however he shared it with Alt News.\n\nA few users raised speculations about Sana not having a blue-tick against her name on Instagram. However, as explained earlier in this report, the verification symbol does not appear on stories but homepage and Instagram feed.\n\nSourav Ganguly\u2019s tweet that Sana\u2019s post is \u201cnot true\u201d is therefore false. Multiple individuals took screenshots of Sana\u2019s story at different times thus pointing to the fact that these were genuine captures.", "lang": "en"}
