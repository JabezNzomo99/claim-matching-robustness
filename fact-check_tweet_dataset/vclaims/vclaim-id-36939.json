Then the post seems to hand the mic to Eastwood. \"Preparing to say goodbye - Clint Eastwood. My Twilight Years at 88.\"\n\nWhat follows are words about values and family and friends before pivoting.\n\n\"Just in case I\u2019m gone tomorrow, please know this I voted against that incompetent, lying, insincere, narcissistic, double-talking, socialist hypocrite, and fiscally irresponsible moron who spent eight years in the White House trying to destroy our military, our Homeland Security Department, our Treastury Department, our Justice Department, and turn our wonderful country into a Muslim loving, socialist shit hole like the one he came from, and I don\u2019t mean Hawaii!\"\n\nHe has \"one more thing\" to say before signing off: \"Participating in a gun buy-back program, because you think criminals have too many guns, is like having yourself castrated because you think your neighbors have too many kids. Regards, Clint.\"\n\nThis post, which has been shared more than 97,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

In that version, Eastwood supposedly said he voted against \"that incompetent, lying, flip-flopping, insincere, double-talking, radical socialist, terrorist excusing, bleeding heart, narcisisstic, scientific and economic moron.\"\n\nSnopes fact-checked yet another version back in March 2014 and traced them back to untitled, uncredited postings made a year prior that were not connected to Eastwood at all.\n\nWe found nothing to substantiate this Facebook post.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
