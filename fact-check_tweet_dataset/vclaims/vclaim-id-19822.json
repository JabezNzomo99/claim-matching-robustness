No, that's not actually true: the rant video that has been circulating on social media is at least two years old so it can't have been made in response to yesterday's bans.\n\nAn example of the video can be seen in this tweet published by Twitter user @classiclib3ral on August 6, 2018 (archived here, video archived here) which was captioned:\n\nIn the video, Jones can be heard shouting:\n\nWe were unable to determine exactly in which context Jones posted this video (since YouTube deleted his channel it is now impossible to use it for research). But we found the video published on the YouTube channel of a user named Cheesyc on November 14, 2016 (archived here).\n\nA longer clip showing the context of the rant was posted on October 13, 2016 by Youtube user \"drew p. weiner\" (archived here, video archived here). In it, Jones can be seen ranting and raving against \"Global elites\" and Hillary Clinton. The shorter video clip circulating today is an edit that cuts out the middle part and opening of this monologue.\n\nIf the video was indeed from that period it would correspond with a big dip in Donald Trump's election polling after several allegations were made against him by women claiming he had assaulted him.\n\nThe phrase \"animated contest of liberty\" seems to be Jones misquoting Samuel Adams, who famously spoke of an \"animated contest of freedom\":\n\nSamuel Adams Quotes (Author of The Writings of Samuel Adams - Volume 2) 19 quotes from Samuel Adams: 'If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you.", "lang": "en"}
