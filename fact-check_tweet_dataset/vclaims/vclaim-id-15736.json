The Afghan people are being abused. And there is no clear end to it.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon maintains approximately 14,000 personnel in Afghanistan for \u201cOperation Freedom\u2019s Sentinel,\u201d tasked with helping the Afghan government \u201cto support and sustain its forces.\u201d\n\nKadyrov cited the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UANAMA) \u201cQuarterly Report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict: January 1 to March 31,\u201d which was released on April 24.\n\nThe report does not provide data on drug trafficking in Afghanistan.\n\nAs Kadyrov noted, the UN data shows \u201csignificant increases in civilian casualties from aerial and search operations, which drove an overall increase in civilian casualties by pro-government forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween 1 January and 31 March 2019, UNAMA attributed 608 civilian casualties (305 deaths and 303 injured) to Pro-Government Forces, representing a 39 percent increase from the same period last year. UNAMA notes with concern that Pro-Government Forces were responsible for more civilian deaths than Anti-Government Elements during the first quarter of 2019,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe breakdown of the data demonstrates that UNAMA attributed 17% of civilian casualties to the Afghan national security forces, 13% to international military forces, two percent to pro-government armed groups, and two per cent to multiple pro-government forces.\n\nHowever, the UN report does not confirm Kadyrov\u2019s claim that \u201caround 400 civilians have died through the fault of the U.S. troops and the forces of official Kabul enlisted by them.\u201d In fact, a total of 305 civilians were killed as a result of actions by international forces, Afghan government forces and pro-government forces taken together. International forces alone were responsible for 146 deaths.\n\nThe U.S. currently accounts for some 14,000 of the roughly 17,000 troops from 39 countries on the ground in Afghanistan as part of the NATO\u2019s mission \u201cResolute Support.\u201d\n\nSo, Kadyrov is right in pointing that anti-government forces in Afghanistan account for fewer civilian deaths than the pro-government side. However, Kadyrov\u2019s overstatement of the numbers and his tendency to overly attribute the numbers to the U.S. earns our verdict of \u201cmisleading.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
