For a comparison, Mr. Francis noted that violent crime in Manchester, England, nearly doubled in that same period.\n\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales, a metric of crime used by the Office for National Statistics, shows that violent crime has not changed significantly relative to the start of Mr. Khan\u2019s term. By that measure \u2014 which, unlike reported crime, is not influenced by reporting rates of incidents unnoticed by the police \u2014 London\u2019s violent crime rate decreased to 14 incidents per 1,000 people in 2017 from 19 incidents per 1,000 people in 2016, before returning to 19 incidents per 1,000 people in 2018.\n\nThe police recorded that crime grew by 3 percent in London from December 2017 to December 2018, compared with 7 percent across England and Wales. London\u2019s total crime rate of 95.4 per 1,000 people in 2018, per police data, is above the national average, but below the rates of several other areas, like Manchester (119.7), Cleveland (115.5), Lancashire (109.2) and Kent (107.6). London\u2019s violent crime rate was below the national average, though its theft and robbery rates were the highest across the country.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Where are the protests? I don\u2019t see any protests.\u2019 I did see a small protest today when I came \u2014 very small. So a lot of it is fake news.\u201d\n\n\u2014 News conference with Prime Minister Theresa May in London\n\nAttendance was lower than the protests during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Britain last July, but still sizable. Protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square, outside Buckingham Palace and in Parliament Square, among other locations in the city. Organizers estimated a turnout of 75,000 on Tuesday, while news reports \u2014 including Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred outlet, Fox News \u2014 have cited thousands of participants.\n\n\u201cI really predicted what was going to happen. Some of you remember that prediction. It was a strong prediction, made at a certain location on a development we were opening the day before it happened.\u201d\n\n\u2014 News conference with Prime Minister Theresa May in London\n\nWhile Mr. Trump did make statements about Brexit before the referendum, the one he was referring to occurred afterward. He said, \u201cI think that Britain will separate from the E.U.\u201d But that comment occurred in March 2016, and not at the location he was referring to.", "lang": "en"}
