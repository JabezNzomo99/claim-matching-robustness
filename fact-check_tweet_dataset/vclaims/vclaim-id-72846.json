What we need is more Jesus care. I believe if we can just get more of the people with pre-existing health conditions back into churches, you would see a lot of healing and many of these problems would go away. People who lead Godly lives don\u2019t worry about Doctors. We have The Lord to take care of us.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe quote is fabricated. There is no record of Pence ever saying those words.\n\nIt first appeared online in May 2017 following House Republicans' approval of the American Health Care Act, a measure to partially repeal Obamacare. It later failed in the Senate.\n\nThis time around, the quote was posted Feb. 14 on a Facebook page called \"Why Republicans Suck.\" In less than 24 hours it racked up nearly 200 shares.\n\nThe quote\u2019s text is alongside a photo of Pence and what resembles a Fox News symbol. The symbol is actually from a page called \"Fox News the FB page,\" which reportedly started circulating the fake quote. The page is not affiliated with the news outlet and can no longer be found on Facebook.\n\nAlyssa Farah, Pence\u2019s press secretary, also told us the quote is bogus: \"This quote is fake and wasn\u2019t said by Vice President Pence.\"\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
