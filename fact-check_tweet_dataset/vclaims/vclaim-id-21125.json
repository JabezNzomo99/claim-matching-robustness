Consulting national and European security databases to ensure the passport holder doesn\u2019t pose a threat was done on a \u201cnon-systematic basis\u201d.\n\nThe rules were also previously not as strict on checks for non-EU passengers leaving the Schengen area.\n\nThe new rules, which came into force on 7 April 2017, now mean that the checks against various security databases must be made for everyone entering and leaving the Schengen area. Though coming into force in spring, the regulations only made headline news recently during the peak of the holiday season, where the tougher passport checks have been causing delays.\n\nIt has been suggested that the queues come from the EU, or countries in the EU, wanting to punish the UK over Brexit.\n\nThe new regulations were set out in a proposal in December 2015, six months before the Brexit referendum\u2014so they\u2019re not a direct response to the vote. The EU says they were made in \u201cresponse to the increase of terrorist threats in Europe\u2026 but should address all potential risks to internal security.\u201d\n\nThe rules also don\u2019t affect the UK exclusively. For example, they add more stringent checks for all EU citizens travelling to the six EU countries not in the Schengen area\u2014Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Ireland, Romania, and the UK\u2014and also confirm the need for stringent checks for all non-EU citizens leaving the Schengen area.\n\nThere has been some debate over the extent to which the queues could have been alleviated by authorities in each country, and why they haven\u2019t been. The EU security commissioner, Sir Julian King, reportedly said on Wednesday that \u201cborder agencies and airport authorities have had lots of time to prepare and put in place the necessary arrangements and staff\u201d.\n\nThe new regulations also state that \u201cmember states should deploy appropriate staff and resources in sufficient numbers to carry out systematic checks in order to prevent such checks from causing disproportionate waiting times and hindering the flow of traffic at external borders\u201d.\n\nIf airports have purposefully chosen not to get extra staff in to make Brits queue for longer, then it\u2019s a punishment that won\u2019t be falling on Brits alone.\n\nAn airline lobby group Airlines for Europe has put the queues down to European governments underestimating the impact of the tighter checks, telling the BBC:\n\n\u201cIt seems the governments - especially in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium - underestimated the situation of many passengers going through tighter passport checks and have not provided a sufficient amount of border control officers.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
