The statement is as follows- \u2018Modi government should also pay attention to Rohingya Muslims. Otherwise, people will lose faith in the government\u2019. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Sharukh Khan has urged the Modi government to pay attention to Rohingya Muslims for people not to lose faith in the government. Fact: Shahrukh Khan hasn\u2019t made the mentioned statement. Information from no credible source was found which confirms that the comment was made by him. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google to check if Shahrukh Khan has made such comments, no result with relevant information was found. If he had really made such statements, owing to their sensitivity, they would have been reported by all the major newspapers and channels in India. But no news agency has reported anything about Shahrukh Khan making such a statement.\n\nOn performing a Twitter advanced search on the official Twitter account of Shahrukh Khan with the text \u2013 \u2018\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0930\u094b\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0917\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u092a\u0930 \u092d\u0940 \u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 \u0926\u0947,\u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0924\u094b \u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b \u0915\u093e \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938 \u0909\u0920 \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0917\u093e\u2019, it was found that he hasn\u2019t tweeted anything about it. Also, no information was found regarding \u2018orientaltimes.in\u2019 (the news portal that appears in the viral post). The website is not available at the time of writing this article. One of its archived pages can be found here.\n\nTo sum it up, Shahrukh Khan has not made a statement about the Modi government\u2019s help to Rohingyas Muslims. It is being falsely attributed to him.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
