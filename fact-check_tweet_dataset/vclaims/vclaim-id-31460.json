A new one claims to show the BBC reported on the death of Bryant\u2019s eldest daughter, Natalia.\n\nThe video shows a photo of Natalia with text that says \"R.I.P. Natalia Bryant 2003-2020.\"\n\nThis is not true. Natalia Bryant\u2019s death has not been reported by any credible news organizations, including the BBC.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The anchor says \"the shock is still raw for fans\" before cutting out and showing a graphic content warning label. Clicking on the label opens a new window prompting you to share the post on Facebook. Many have done so, helping to spread the reach of the hoax.\n\nWe rate this abhorrent claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
