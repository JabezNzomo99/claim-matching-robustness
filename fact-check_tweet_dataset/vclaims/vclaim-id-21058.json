A South African\n\nasked us to look into the minister\u2019s statement.\n\nMotshekga was referring to the findings of the latest\n\nTIMSS) from 2015, the department of basic education\u2019s media liaison officer, Elijah Mhlanga, told Africa Check.\n\nThe study, conducted every 4 years, provides participating countries with the\n\nIt also collects data on\n\nthat can affect learning including school resources, student attitudes, teaching methods and support at home.\n\nTests were given to Grade 4 and Grade 8 pupils in most of the countries that took part in the study. However, Grade 5 pupils were tested in South Africa and Norway, and Grade 9 pupils were tested in Botswana, Norway and South Africa.\n\n\u2018Made fun of me or called me names\u2019\n\nSchool safety, including bullying, was measured to help assess school environments.\n\nPupils were asked how often they experienced certain bullying behaviours on a scale ranging from \u201cnever\u201d to \u201cat least once a week\u201d. A bullying scale was then created using the pupils' responses to how often they encountered the following bullying behaviours:\n\nout of the 49 countries surveyed. Most pupils (44%) reported being bullied \u201cabout weekly\u201d and 34% reported being bullied \u201cabout monthly\u201d.\n\n. This compares to 40% of girls.\n\nThe report also highlights that pupils in South Africa\u2019s public schools are bullied more than those in independent schools. Close to 48% of pupils in no-fee schools reported being bullied \u201cabout weekly\u201d compared to about 25% of independent school pupils.\n\nout of 38 countries, behind Botswana and Thailand. The majority of Grade 9 pupils (47%) reported being bullied \u201cabout monthly\u201d and 17% reported being bullied \u201cabout weekly\u201d.\n\nrevealed that pupils who reported \u201calmost never\u201d experiencing bullying scored higher for maths and science than pupils who reported experiencing bullying on a weekly basis.\n\n'Study does not include all countries in the world'\n\nShe told us that reporting that South African pupils are the most bullied would be incorrect \u201cas the TIMSS study does not include all countries in the world\u201d.\n\nA more accurate way of reporting on this data would highlight that \u201cof the countries who participated in TIMSS at the Grade 4/5 level, South Africa shows the highest incidences of learners being bullied on a weekly basis (44%). This is more than double the TIMSS international average,\" they told us.\n\nConclusion: Minister wide of the mark about study findings\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s minister of basic education is rightly worried about bullying in schools.\n\nThe country\u2019s Grade 5 pupils reported the highest frequency of bullying among 49 countries that took part in a 2015 survey.\n\nNearly 50% of its Grade 9 pupils reported being bullied \u201cabout monthly\u201d. Of the 38 countries studied, only Thailand and Botswana\u2019s pupils reported being bullied more.\n\nHowever, the study\u2019s research coordinator in South Africa said that the results don\u2019t show that the country\u2019s pupils are the \u201cmost bullied\u201d in the world, as only two age groups were surveyed and fewer than 50 countries took part.\n\nOnly 2 age groups were surveyed & fewer than 50 countries took parthttps://africacheck.org/spot_check/south-african-pupils-not-second-worst-world-maths-science/https://africacheck.org/factsheets/guide-assessing-south-africas-schooling-system/", "lang": "en"}
