That\u2019s not true. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is widely viewed to have bungled the rollout of its viral test kits, there was a test kit at the time, and it had been successfully used by the agency and some states.\n\nThe novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the pneumonia-like illness called COVID-19, which first appeared in an outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.\n\nWe\u2019ll explain how testing works, what happened with the CDC\u2019s coronavirus test and what\u2019s known about how many tests are available in the U.S.\n\nMost of the available diagnostics are molecular tests that use a standard molecular biology technique known as the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to detect even a very tiny amount of the virus in a specimen.\n\nThe test takes advantage of some natural features of biology to essentially scan through all of the RNA present in a sample \u2014 such as a nose or throat swab, or some phlegm \u2014 and search for the presence of coronavirus RNA. The scanning happens with test components known as primers and probes, which are sequence-based, and therefore can be made specific to the virus.\n\nIn those reactions, if the novel coronavirus is present in the sample, then a short snippet of DNA is copied many times over, which can be read out on a machine. If there is no virus \u2014 or if there\u2019s a different virus, such as influenza \u2014 then no DNA fragment is made and there\u2019s no signal to detect.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s test was designed to use three main sets of primers and probes \u2014 two that match just the novel coronavirus, and one that matches a variety of highly similar viruses. Someone infected with COVID-19 should test positive for all three, while someone who\u2019s not infected should be negative for all three. A person who has SARS would only test positive using the third primer and probe set, thereby offering a way to theoretically discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and other similar viruses. That concern, however, is hypothetical in this case, since there isn\u2019t a known outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n\nEventually, the CDC will have a different so-called serology test that looks for whether a person developed antibodies in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. The test, which does not need to be done when someone is actively infected, can yield a positive result whether or not someone developed symptoms. It therefore may provide answers about how many COVID-19 infections there were and how deadly the virus is in the larger population.\n\nWhat went wrong with the CDC\u2019s test kits?\n\nEarly on, all COVID-19 testing was done at the CDC with its own kit, and it performed well. The kit was successfully used to diagnose the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. on Jan. 20 in a patient returning from Wuhan to Washington state. A CDC report also notes that between Jan. 18 and Feb. 23, the agency tested 2,620 specimens from just over 1,000 people.\n\nProblems arose after Feb. 5, when the CDC began shipping its kits out to qualified state and local public health labs in an effort to expand testing. Initially, the agency said it was releasing 200 kits \u2014 each capable of testing around 700 to 800 specimens \u2014 giving labs just one kit each. But by Feb. 12, the CDC told reporters that some labs had been experiencing issues when doing verification tests to make sure the tests worked.\n\nThe CDC has not clarified exactly what the issue was, but has said that there was a manufacturing problem related to the third test component, which led to \u201cinconclusive\u201d results. The Association of Public Health Laboratories told us more specifically that a negative control, which should not have reacted to any of the primer and probe sets, was coming back positive for the third set, which was the test for all SARS-like coronaviruses.\n\nFor a while, the agency promised to re-manufacture the faulty third component and distribute that to the public health labs and, in the meantime, asked any lab that had difficulties to send samples into the CDC for testing. As a result, as of Feb. 25, only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing.\n\nMore than two weeks after first announcing the testing issue, the CDC said it had come up with a fix \u2014 labs could proceed without the third test, and just use the two other primer and probe sets to make accurate diagnoses. The agency also said that it had manufactured new tests with just the two components, omitting the third.\n\nOther than the lack of CDC test kits, several other circumstances prevented wider scale testing early in the outbreak.\n\nOne was the criteria the CDC used to determine who would be tested for the virus. At first, the CDC recommended testing only for those who had a fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms, and had traveled to Wuhan or had contact with a suspected or confirmed coronavirus case.\n\nIn late February, after a patient in California was found to be infected despite a lack of known exposure, the CDC guidelines were relaxed to include anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. Then, on March 3, Vice President Pence announced that the CDC would lift all restrictions, as long as a doctor ordered the test.\n\nThe CDC updated its clinical criteria web page the next day, stating that clinicians \u201cshould use their judgment\u201d in deciding who should be tested, keeping in mind the local epidemiology and COVID-19 symptoms \u2014 and strongly encouraging testing for other respiratory infections, such as influenza.\n\nAnother issue had to do with who could do COVID-19 testing.\n\nAcademic labs and other similar facilities that had the expertise to develop tests were advised not to use their own tests for diagnosing patients until they sought permission from the Food and Drug Administration. As we\u2019ve explained before, this is not a law but has been a de facto FDA policy. On Feb. 29, the FDA announced that validated in-house tests could be used for diagnosis immediately, as long as the agency received applications for the emergency use of the tests within 15 business days.\n\nHow problematic was the delay?\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear exactly what the delays meant for the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. But some experts say the lack of testing in many of the nation\u2019s public health labs hampered early detection.\n\nThe CDC reported the first case of possible community spread on Feb. 26, and the first reported death, in a Seattle suburb, followed three days later. It would later turn out that two COVID-19-related deaths happened as early as Feb. 26. A genetic analysis of some of the first cases in Washington state also suggested that the virus had been circulating undetected since mid-January. The state did not begin its own testing until Feb. 28.\n\nScott Lindquist, an epidemiologist with the Washington Department of Health, told the Seattle Times that problems with the CDC\u2019s test kit \u201creally did set us back, there\u2019s no denying that.\u201d\n\nIn a CDC telebriefing announcing the first U.S. death, Jeffrey Duchin, a University of Washington epidemiologist and health officer for Public Health Seattle and King County, noted that the patient who died had been tested locally, but only because the lab had just received kits and because of \u201cvery recent\u201d changes in CDC criteria for testing. \u201cIf we had the ability to test earlier,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m sure we would have identified patients earlier in the community.\u201d\n\nWith more available tests and less stringent clinical criteria for testing, the U.S. could have set up a more proactive system for detecting coronavirus cases, although it\u2019s possible the outcome would still be the same.\n\nThe CDC, in fact, wanted to set up a five- or six-site surveillance network in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City, which would begin testing for COVID-19 in people with flu-like symptoms who test negative for influenza. The plan was to then scale up the network to each state. But with the test kit difficulties, that schedule was set back. On Feb. 28, the CDC said that it expected to have the first of six sites up and running by the following week. When we asked on March 10, the agency did not have an immediate update on the program.\n\nHow many tests are available?\n\nThroughout last week, officials gave confusing and conflicting answers about how many tests would be available \u2014 and when \u2014 in various appearances.\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Azar said on March 1 that \u201cwe now have the ability to test 75,000 people in the field at this moment,\u201d but later said that those tests would be shipped by the end of the week.\n\nVice President Mike Pence also at times referred to test kits, when he meant the number of people who could be tested, and said on March 4, \u201cWe\u2019ll have over a million tests in the field today,\u201d a statement that conflicted with other administration estimates of 1 million tests shipping out by the end of the week.\n\nPart of the confusion has to do with the fact that testing is happening at several different levels \u2014 by the CDC, by state and local public health labs, and at hospitals and other facilities \u2014 and that the words used to describe the testing aren\u2019t always consistent.\n\nA test \u201ckit\u201d means an entire box of supplies to run tests to diagnose many people. A CDC test kit, for example, is able to test 700 to 800 specimens. Other test kits come with enough reagents for 500 \u201creactions.\u201d Because controls need to be run, fewer than 500 samples can be tested with such a kit. And in both cases, the actual number of people who could be diagnosed with each will be lower, since patients may have multiple samples or samples may be run in duplicate. The same issue applies to the word \u201ctest.\u201d\n\nFDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn provided the clearest answer about testing capacity on March 7, when he said that the CDC had shipped enough kits to state and local public health labs to test 75,000 people for COVID-19.\n\nIn addition, more than 1.1 million tests manufactured by Integrated DNA Technologies had been shipped as of March 6 for non-public health labs to use, with another 400,000 possibly shipping by March 9. A separate manufacturer had also produced 640,000 tests that could have shipped as early as March 9, once quality control testing was complete.\n\n\u201cThe actual number of tests that have shipped is larger than the number of patients that can be tested,\u201d Hahn explained, noting that the approximately 2.1 million tests from IDT and another company would allow roughly 850,000 Americans to be tested.\n\nOn top of those tests, he added, would be any testing by commercial or academic labs, plus an expected additional 4 million tests from IDT and the other company by the end of this week. The CDC itself also can test approximately 350 specimens per day.\n\nIn a March 9 telebriefing, the CDC\u2019s Nancy Messonnier clarified that the 75,000 people that can be tested using the CDC\u2019s test kit in public health labs is a cumulative figure. She also said that in the coming weeks, as more manufacturers join the effort, the \u201cmajority\u201d of testing will be from the commercial sector.\n\nSeveral commercial companies have stepped forward to increase production. Quest Diagnostics said it could begin testing on March 9, and LabCorp said its test was available for ordering on March 5, with results taking three to four days once a specimen is received in the mail.\n\nCan \u201canybody that wants a test\u201d get one, as the president said?\n\nNot quite. On a March 6 visit to the CDC, Trump said, \u201cAnybody that wants a test can get a test,\u201d adding, \u201cAnybody right now and yesterday \u2014 anybody that needs a test gets a test. We \u2014 they\u2019re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.\u201d\n\nWhen we asked the White House about this, the vice president\u2019s office told us that tests were available through state labs, but that doctors needed to contact the state lab to get one. In other words, if someone wants a test, and a physician does not agree, a person cannot be tested.\n\nThis point was also made by Anthony Fauci, the director of the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d when he said tests \u201care out there now,\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s up to the doctor to order the test.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that even if a test has been shipped, it hasn\u2019t necessarily been received or is ready to use right away; tests also take some time to complete, and so results may not be available immediately.\n\nThe CDC maintains that no person was ever denied a coronavirus test, nor was there ever a backlog at the agency. \u201cOur guidance for who can be tested has always allowed room for clinical discretion,\u201d said CDC press officer Richard Quartarone in an email. \u201cThat is, if a doctor had a patient who they wanted tested, CDC has not refused any of these requests.\u201d The only exception to that, Quartarone told us, might be a damaged sample.\n\nSome groups, however, dispute the idea that tests are fully available or that there has never been a shortage.\n\n\u201cWe are now in the phase of the response where demand for testing is greater than the tests available, even when the private/commercial sector is doing testing,\u201d Eric Blank, the chief program officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told us in a March 9 email. \u201cSo there is a test shortage but it is probably not as great as it was a week or so ago.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
