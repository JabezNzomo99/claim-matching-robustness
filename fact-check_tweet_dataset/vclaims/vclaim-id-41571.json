After an extensive investigation, we found the original picture on the Russian search engine, Yandex.\n\nAs can be seen in the original picture, it is former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister, Omar Abdullah with PM Modi in the original picture and not Arnab Goswami.\n\nWe juxtaposed both the pictures and closely analysed them. We found that Arnab\u2019s face was superimposed on Omar Abdullah\u2019s face using photo editing software.\n\nHence, it is proved that the picture in question is FAKE.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
