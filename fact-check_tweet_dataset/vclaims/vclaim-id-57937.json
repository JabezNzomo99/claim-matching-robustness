This claim is misleading; the video previously circulated in reports about a traffic accident in August 2020 in southern Brazil; Portuguese can be heard spoken in the video.\n\nThe 35-second video was published here on Twitter on August 17, 2020. It has been viewed more than 480 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s simplified Chinese caption translates to English as: \u201cWant to know if this is real. Doesn\u2019t look like a typical car accident. August 15, 09:00: Riot proceeds in U.S. Portland! This video is banned in Hong Kong because the US has banned the video and the European media cooperated with them, the outside world did not know about this; this film was sent privately from a foreign classmate of a certain congressman. Please share this post to let more Americans know what is going on in Portland/the city. August 15, 09:11: This is the actual scene of human bodies being driven through with tanks. \u201d\n\nThe video was also shared on Facebook here and on Twitter here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes extracted from the footage found an identical video published here on Twitter on August 6, 2020.\n\nThe tweet reads: \u201cWARNING: some scenes may be unsuitable for some viewers. Yesterday from 2-3 days there was a car crash in Brazil after forest fire smoke blew onto highway, who killed a lot of people please pray for them and their family.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the Twitter video (R):\n\nCloser examination of the video also revealed a voice saying \"My daughter is still alive\" in Portuguese at the 18-second mark.\n\nA subsequent keyword search found this August 3, 2020 report by Brazil-based news website Metropoles about an accident involving 22 vehicles on a highway in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais city of Paran\u00e1, Brazil.\n\nThe report\u2019s Portuguese headline translates to English as: \u201cPhotos show destruction in a serious accident in Paran\u00e1; eight died\u201d.\n\nIt reads, in part: \u201cA very serious accident involving 22 vehicles on the BR-277, in the region of motels in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais, in the metropolitan region of Curitiba, caused eight deaths on Sunday night (2/8).\n\n\u201cThe accident involved a truck, five motorcycles, 15 cars and a Military Police (PM) vehicle. About ten ambulances were called. In all, 22 were injured at the scene.\u201d\n\nThe incident was also reported by Paran\u00e1-based newspaper Gazeta do Povo here and Chinese state media Xinhua here.\n\nThe claim was also debunked by Taiwanese fact checking organisation MyGoPen here.", "lang": "en"}
