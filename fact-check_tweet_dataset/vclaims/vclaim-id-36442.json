This is Abaco Island. The Bahamian people were the kindest people I\u2019ve ever met. The Bahamas holds a special place in my heart and waking up to this picture of the devastation from Dorian is heartbreaking.\u201d That caption accompanied a photograph of an island or coastal location that appeared to have sustained considerable storm damage:\n\nWhether or not Harris posted the photograph in a sincere attempt to galvanize public solidarity with the inhabitants of the Bahamas, the picture did not show what he said it did.\n\nIn fact, that particular photograph was taken on Oct. 17, 2018, and it showed the damage caused to Mexico Beach, a Florida city that came close to being destroyed by Hurricane Michael. The picture, which can be viewed below, was taken by Getty Images photographer Joe Raedle. Its caption reads:\n\n\u201cThe aftermath of hurricane Michael is seen on October 17, 2018 in Mexico Beach, Florida. The hurricane hit on October 10th along the Florida Panhandle as a category 4 storm causing massive damage and claimed the lives of more than a dozen people.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
