In the tweet Shaikh can be seen calling for \u201cbutchering\u201d of Hindus to \u201cteach them a lesson\u201d. The now-deleted profile of Shaikh claimed that he was a \u201ccorrespondent at Al Jazeera, previously worked at The Wire. Inspired by Rana Ayyub.\u201d\n\nThe above tweet was posted on February 26, but it was hardly given any attention until March 6 when it was widely shared by several users tagging Al Jazeera. One of the first to do so was @desimojito.\n\nThe screenshots shared by @desimojito were also shared by Pakistani Canadian author, Tarek Fatah and Australian, Mohammed Tawhidi, who calls himself Imam of Peace.\n\nRight-wing portal OpIndia also made the same claim before deleting their article without any clarification.\n\nSmita Prakash, the editor of ANI also inquired if the person is employed with Al Jazeera in response to a tweet by Abhijit Iyer-Mitra.\n\nNo affiliation to Al Jazeera, The Wire\n\nThe claim made by Shaikh that he worked with Al Jazeera and The Wire is false. In response to several Twitter users tagging Al Jazeera with the tweets of Shaikh, the channel issued a clarification stating, \u201cThis is a spurious account and has no relation or affiliation to Al Jazeera. The Network doesn\u2019t have any journalist by the name of Dilawar Shaikh.\u201d\n\nFounder-Editor of The Wire, Siddharth Varadarajan also clarified that \u201cno one of this name has ever worked at The Wire.\u201d\n\nReference to Al Jazeera, The Wire added later\n\nIt is interesting to note that while the profile was created in September 2013, it had only 57 followers and had no tweets before Feb 25, 2020.\n\nThe account is now deactivated but Alt News was able to access the archive a past link.", "lang": "en"}
