The Independent, one of the first media outlets to report on the story, wrote on 26 July 2015 that while \u201cmost commentators have assumed that (the attackers) were Muslims,\u201d the victim said that she didn\u2019t know if the attack was motivated by \u201creligious opinions\u201d:\n\nFrench social networks exploded with anger after a young woman was reportedly beaten up by a gang of girls and young women for wearing a bikini in a park. Authorities have not identified the attackers but most commentators have assumed that they were Muslims. The five attackers, aged 16 to 24, were quickly arrested and the three oldest have been remanded to appear in court in September, while two girls aged 16 and 17 face further questioning. The authorities have not named them but said that they all came from housing estates with large Muslim populations. Police told L\u2019Union newspaper that the victim was not able to say whether or not her assailants were motivated by \u201creligious opinions\u201d. Arnaud Robinet, the mayor of Reims, said: \u201cWe have to be very careful not to jump to conclusions. All the same, I can understand why people have assumed that this attack had religious motives. If that turns out to be the case, it is a very serious incident.\u201d\n\nDespite a lack of evidence, several right-wing bloggers used the incident as \u201cproof\u201d that radical Islamists were attempting to force non-Muslims to \u201cbow\u201d to Shariah law:\n\nIs it just me or does it seem like when Muslims aren\u2019t able to force a person to bow to their will and religious beliefs they immediately resort to violence? I mean, I thought Islam was the religion of peace? Loony lefties should probably pass the memo on to this gang of Muslim women in France who decided to beat the snot out of a woman for wearing a bikini in a park, because I don\u2019t think they understand the false narrative progressives are trying to establish. Nothing screams peace and tolerance like a good old fashioned beat down.\n\nBut on 28 July 2015, police confirmed that the attack had nothing to do with the religious beliefs of those involved:\n\nAngelique Sloss was sunbathing in a Leo-Lagrange park in Reims, northern France when she was attacked by the group of five young women. She was reportedly told she was dressing \u201cimmorally\u201d and that she should get dressed before being attacked and beaten. It was initially presumed that the incident was religiously motivated as the young women, aged 16 to 24, who perpetrated the attack were from a largely Muslim housing estate. However, police have since called the incident a fight between two rival girl gangs and said it had \u201cnothing to do with Islam\u201d. Superintendent Julie Galisson said in a statement: \u201cIt was a fight between young girls which degenerated after one of the authors of the aggression said \u2018Get dressed, it\u2019s not summer\u2019.\u201d Nesrine Mook, one of those accused in the beating, said that she sunbathed in the same park in a swimming costume, and that the fight broke out after the victim retorted to the girl who told her to get dressed, \u201cLooking at your body, I see why you can\u2019t wear [a bikini]!\u201d Police have said it is clear from all statements given that the attack had nothing to do with religion.\n\nAll five girls involved in the attack (two of whom were underage) were arrested.", "lang": "en"}
