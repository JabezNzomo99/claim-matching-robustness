Not to mention, Yahaya Bello, himself released a video debunking the claim. Moreover, the report format lacks credibility with no discernable details or source present.\n\nThis news blog published on its site that Yahaya Bello the Governor of Kogi state has tested positive to Covid-19, basing its assertions on the fact that he came in contact with Abba Kyari the president\u2019s chief of staff who tested positive of late.\n\nFirstly, our initial point of reference was the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. And, just like they are yet to confirm a COVID-19 positive from Nigerian senators, the same goes for the incumbent Governor of Kogi state.\n\nMeanwhile, images in circulation show the Kogi state governor with Abba Kyari. We surmise this may have inadvertently triggered this publication by News Report Nigeria. We recall reports recently confirmed Abba Kyari as positive with COVID-19.\n\nFurthermore, customary to some undependable news sites, proper evidential reporting remains absent; with this news site as another example. Matter of fact, we have come across more claims like this in the near past. These clickbait sites essentially make bold headlines and leave the signature \u201cmore details\u201d in the body.\n\nThere has been no report by NCDC or the Kogi state government on the status of the governor. Yahaya Bello, himself, also released a video via politicnigeria.com debunking the misinformation that he tested positive with COVID-19.", "lang": "en"}
