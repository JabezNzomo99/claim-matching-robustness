NHS Digital\u2014which publishes the figures\u2014says it has no data on how many patients had a self-treatable ailment.\n\nThe uncertainty around these figures also means that the estimate of their cost is very rough.\n\nSo what is it all about?\n\nNHS England and Public Health England have launched a campaign which encourages patients to seek advice from a pharmacist when they have a minor ailment, instead of going to a GP or accident and emergency. The campaign is particularly aimed at parents and their children.\n\nNHS England estimates that this could \u201chelp free up GP time for sicker patients and help save the NHS around \u00a3850 million each year as well as save time for busy families\u201d, and provide patients with more convenient, timely advice, according to a press release provided to Full Fact.\n\nCould 18 million GP appointments have been dealt with at home or at a pharmacy?\n\nThere were estimated to be around 300 million GP appointments across England in 2008\u2014the latest official figures we have.\n\nA report by the Primary Care Foundation and the NHS Alliance found that 6% of GP appointments in a 2015 study could have been avoided by patients going to the pharmacy instead (roughly 2%), or caring for themselves without clinical advice (roughly 4%). This would be around 18 million of the 300 million appointments.\n\nBut that figure is quite rough. It\u2019s based on just under 60 GPs self-reporting how many patient consultations they thought could have been avoided, covering around 5,000 appointments altogether. There\u2019s no evidence that these GP appointments were representative of the wider GP sector as a whole, nor that the they were intended to be representative. There was also a lot of variation in the proportion of appointments that different GPs thought were avoidable.\n\nThe number of GP appointments is also likely to have increased a lot in the last ten years, according to expert estimates. However, they also say it\u2019s hard to know for certain.\n\nNHS England says that 2.1 million visits to A&E were \u201cself-treatable\u201d in 2016/17, and told us that this referred to the number of attendances where patients were given no treatment after arriving at A&E in England.\n\nNHS Digital\u2014which publishes the figures\u2014told us it didn\u2019t have any figures on whether or not an A&E attendance could have been managed through self-care.\n\nHow much do avoidable appointments cost?\n\nNHS England said that fewer avoidable appointments will free up GP time for sicker patients, and help to save money.\n\nResearch done by experts at the University of Kent, for NHS England and the Department of Health, found that the average cost of a GP consultation in England in 2016/17 was \u00a331. Based on this, NHS England estimates that the 18 million self-treatable appointments in 2016/17 cost around \u00a3560 million. But the uncertainty around the number of avoidable appointments in the first place also makes this figure problematic.\n\nThe average cost to the NHS in England of someone attending A&E was \u00a3148 in 2016/17, according to figures from NHS Improvement. This, multiplied by the number of A&E appointments that year where no guidance was given, comes to \u00a3310 million. This assumes this type of A&E attendance costs the same as the average.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust also told us that reducing the number of GP and A&E visits might not lead to significant cost reductions. The average cost of an appointment factors in paying staff and occupying the premises, so fewer appointments won\u2019t lead to financial savings unless resources such as the number of staff or buildings used to provide them can be reduced too.", "lang": "en"}
