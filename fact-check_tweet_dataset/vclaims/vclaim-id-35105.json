Not up, but down. And I was able to, over the last couple of years, increase their contribution. \u2026 And over the last couple years, I had them increase by $130 billion. And then, over the next couple of years \u2014 and this was done largely over these last two days, but also set up time before that \u2014 they had to now contribute $400 billion more. So it\u2019s a total of $530 billion other countries will be putting into NATO.\u201d\n\n\u201cTremendous things achieved for U.S. on my NATO trip. Proudly for our Country, no President has ever achieved so much in so little time. Without a U.S. increase, other countries have already increased by $130 Billion-with $400 Billion soon. Such a thing has never been done before!\u201d\n\nNATO was established in the aftermath of World War II, originally with 12 members and the intention of binding together Western Europe in a defense alliance with the United States and Canada to counter the Soviet Union and its satellite countries in Eastern Europe (known as the Warsaw Pact). After the Soviet Union collapsed and the Warsaw Pact unraveled, NATO expanded to include many Eastern European nations and even former parts of the Soviet Union. There are now 29 member countries in NATO, with the newest member, Montenegro, added in 2017.\n\nWith the largest economy in NATO, the United States has generally paid the largest share, about 22 percent, but Trump recently demanded a reduction so that the United States will pay about the same share as Germany, or 16 percent. (This is what Trump is referring to when he says the United States will pay \u201cless.\u201d)\n\nNote the date \u2014 that was three years before Trump became president, and a year before he even announced he was running for president. Yet he persistently claims credit for actions that were underway before he became president \u2014 and consistently misleads about where NATO funding was headed before he became president.\n\nFor instance, he asserted on Dec. 5: \u201cAs you know, NATO was suffering very badly from depletion of funds, and it was going down like a roller coaster goes down. Not up, but down. And I was able to, over the last couple of years, increase their contribution.\u201d On Dec. 3, he even cited looking at a chart: \u201cSo NATO, which was really heading in the wrong direction three years ago \u2014 it was heading down. If you look at a graph, it was to a point where I don\u2019t think they could have gone on much longer.\u201d\n\nAs for the $130 billion extra that Trump falsely claims he has collected, once again we must emphasize this is money that each country is spending on its own defense. It does not go into a pot for NATO\u2019s use, though better-funded militaries might enhance NATO\u2019s competitive edge.\n\nIn any case, the NATO guideline for each nation to spend 2 percent of a nation\u2019s gross domestic product on defense is rather arbitrary, especially for smaller economies. Bulgaria leapfrogged into meeting the guideline in 2019 because of a $1.67 billion deal to purchase eight F-16 fighter jets from the United States. Greece was able to meet the guideline mainly because its economy collapsed, shrinking its GDP, not because of any big defense increase.", "lang": "en"}
