It was originally posted on worstpot.us, which claims to only publish satire.\n\nA disclaimer on that website states: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real.\u201d But the story was presented as news on conservativepaper.us, which did not notify readers that the story was intended as satire.\n\nThere are clues the story is false, though.\n\nIt claims Kaepernick \u201cdecided that he would crash the field during the national anthem in San Francisco, this afternoon, running to the 50-yard line to take a knee, \u2018black power\u2019 fist in the air.\u201d But Sunday\u2019s game was played in Minneapolis, not San Francisco.\n\nAlso, the photo used in the story on the satire site, which shows a man on the ground, surround by five officers, comes from a 2013 incident when a fan was tackled by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper after he ran onto the field during a college football game between the University of Oklahoma and Iowa State University.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Kaepernick Arrested for Publicity Stunt During Anthem in San Fran.\u201d Worstpot.us/ever. 9 Sep 2018.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Kaepernick Arrested for Publicity Stunt During Anthem in San Fran.\u201d Conservativepaper.us. 9 Sep 2018.\n\n\u201cTrooper Makes Tackle of the Game When Taking Down Unruly OU Fan.\u201d KFOR. 18 Nov 2013.\n\nNike. \u201cA Crazy Dream Becomes Reality When You Just Do It.\u201d Press release. 5 Sep 2018.", "lang": "en"}
