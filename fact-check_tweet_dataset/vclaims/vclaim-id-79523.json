On the Sunday shows, there was much talk about whether the country should spend much time talking about Clinton\u2019s health.\n\nFox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said there is more to be learned and noted that former President Bill Clinton himself revealed that the concussion was \"terrible\" and required six months of treatment. Hume said that is \"new news\" that had been \"widely overlooked.\"\n\nWhile Bill Clinton\u2019s quip that Republicans thought Hillary Clinton is auditioning for a part on The Walking Dead \"was reported everywhere,\" Hume said, \"the part where he said that she underwent what I guess was six months of physical therapy to recover from the concussion, a \u2018terrible concussion,\u2019 was new news. And of course, it was widely overlooked.\"\n\nIn this fact-check, we examine whether, as Hume said, much of the media failed to report those additional details from President Clinton.\n\nFox News had an interview segment specifically about Clinton\u2019s reference to six months and a terrible concussion but fans of other networks got a similar message.\n\nsaid Clinton went beyond defending his wife.\n\n\"The former president revealed that his wife\u2019s injury 'required six months of very serious work to get over,' he said during a question-and-answer session at the Peterson Foundation in Washington.\n\n\"'They went to all this trouble to say she had staged what was a terrible concussion that required six months of very serious work to get over,' he said. 'It\u2019s something she never low-balled with the American people, never tried to pretend it didn\u2019t happen.'\"\n\nnoted that Clinton had shared details that guaranteed the issue would remain alive.\n\n\"But he went on to say this, proving this was no minor fall: 'She had sustained what was a terrible concussion. Required six months of very serious work to get over.'\"\n\n\"'She certainly seems to have more stamina now and there's nothing to it,' Clinton said during a question and answer session with PBS' Gwen Ifill. 'I was sort of dumbfounded. They went to all this trouble to say she had staged what was a terrible concussion that required six months of very serious work to get over, something she never lowballed with the American people, never tried to pretend didn't happen.'\"\n\n, MSNBC, and all presented similar accounts. NBC Nightly News included Clinton\u2019s quote during its broadcast as did PBS NewsHour. We also found mentions on CNN\u2019s Out Front and MSNBC\u2019s PoliticsNation and The Ed Show.\n\nDitto basically for major U.S. newspapers and wire services.\n\nThe led with Bill Clinton\u2019s reference to a long recovery.\n\n\"Former President Bill Clinton said Wednesday his wife Hillary took six months to recover from a 2012 concussion, adding she is now 'stronger than I am' as he dismissed GOP strategist Karl Rove's comments about her health.\"\n\nHundreds of print and broadcast services across the country carry the AP\u2019s stories.\n\nThe noted in its coverage the significance of everything Clinton said.\n\n\"He did acknowledge that Mrs. Clinton had suffered a 'very serious concussion,' and that it had taken her months to fully recover.\"\n\nMr. Clinton, speaking at a forum on budget issues Wednesday in Washington, also offered some fresh insights into the December 2012 incident, saying that Hillary Clinton suffered a 'terrible concussion' that entailed 'six months of very serious work' toward recovery.\n\nThe did not give top billing to the detail about six months of recovery but did report it. The New York Daily News included the former president\u2019s description, writing, \"She endured six months of \u2018very serious work\u2019\" to recover from a concussion and blood clot but now \u2018she is strong; she is doing great,\u2019 he (Clinton) said.\"\n\nThe liberal had a story with this headline: \"Bill Clinton Insults Rove, But Acknowledges Hillary's Health Is 'Serious Issue'.\"\n\n\"The 42nd president also revealed that he knows questions about his wife's health and age can't be ignored as the 2016 presidential race comes into focus. In fact, he called it 'a serious issue.'\"\n\nA few sentences later, the article quoted Clinton in full, speaking of \"a terrible concussion\" that \"required six months of serious work to get over.\"\n\nalso provided Clinton\u2019s complete description in the third paragraph of its article. mentioned the six-month recovery period, although further down in its story.\n\nHume said much of the media overlooked that Bill Clinton said his wife had suffered a terrible concussion that required six months of work before she recovered.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton\u2019s Walking Dead zinger may have gotten more airtime (we didn\u2019t check), Hume is wrong to assert that the media ignored Clinton\u2019s substantive comments.\n\nClinton\u2019s comments were covered in print by the nation\u2019s biggest newspapers, in online articles, and on the TV networks and elsewhere.", "lang": "en"}
