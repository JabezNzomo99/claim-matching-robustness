Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and major weather events \u2014 have been combined in one recent falsehood.\n\nA fake tweet created as some states on the east coast prepared for Hurricane Dorian claims that Ocasio-Cortez posted this on her Twitter page: \u201cI see people are rushing out to fill up their cars for this hurricane at the gas station This wouldn\u2019t be an issue if they had electric cars. If the power is out for a week how are they going to get gas? We need to start planning ahead and moving forward.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who has made a reputation for herself as an environmental advocate, didn\u2019t post that message.\n\nHer Twitter account shows no such post and neither does Politwoops, a website that publishes the deleted tweets from public officials\u2019 Twitter accounts.\n\nShe did tweet on Aug. 30 \u2014 the same date as the fake tweet \u2014 about posters promoting her Green New Deal, which is aimed at addressing climate change and creating jobs.\n\nBut the phony tweet has been circulating on Facebook \u2014 where it was shared by the Libertarian and Republican parties of Jefferson County, Colorado, and by the Republican Party of Elbert County, Colorado \u2014 and Twitter, where one account rephrased the claim as a quote from the congresswoman and it was retweeted a thousand times.\n\nThis is just the latest example of a false statement attributed to Ocasio-Cortez that we\u2019ve written about.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
