(The Delhi police halted an ambulance for Rahul Gandhi\u2019s rally. For the child inside the ambulance, it was a matter of life and death. In the end, she died),\u201d is the caption used to share the video, which shows a stationary ambulance in front of a police barricade, followed by a long stream of vehicles.\n\nThe 1:36-minute clip is viral on Facebook.\n\nIndividual users on Twitter have also shared the video with the identical narrative.\n\nThe claim that an ambulance was stopped from passing through due to Rahul Gandhi\u2019s rally in Delhi is false. The video viral across social media platforms is from 2017 and was uploaded as a Facebook live by one user Preet Narula. The original clip almost two minutes long.\n\nAlt News also found a news report by Hindustan Times dated April 5, 2017, related to the incident. According to the report, the incident took place near the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, and the route was blocked as the convoy of the Head of Malaysia was to pass from the area.\n\nThe report also quotes a senior police officer who had said, \u201cThe ambulance was stuck behind several cars. We got the passage cleared and brought it ahead. In a span of few minutes, it was allowed to go.\u201d\n\nAlt News had also fact-checked this video last month when it was viral as \u2018Delhi police stopped an ambulance for BJP MP Manoj Tiwari.\u2019", "lang": "en"}
