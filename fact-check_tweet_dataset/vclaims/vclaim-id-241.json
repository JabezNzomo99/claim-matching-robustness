The posts also say that New York City hospitals are \u201cinflating all of their #coronavirus numbers\u201d to take advantage of this section of the act. The claims made in these posts are partly false.\n\nExamples of the post can be seen here and here .\n\nIt is true that a section of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (or the CARES Act) calls for higher compensation from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for the care of patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COVID-19. Contrary to what the posts claim, however, the measure is found in Section 3710, not 4409, and the increase is 20%, not 15%. It appears that the content\u2019s author confused the version of the bill that went through the Senate on March 21 ( here ) with the final House version ( here ), which became public law on March 27.\n\nSection 3710 of the CARES Act calls for the following: \u201cFor discharges occurring during the emergency period described in section 1135(g)(1)(B), in the case of a discharge of an individual diagnosed with COVID\u201319, the Secretary (of Health and Human Services) shall increase the weighting factor that would otherwise apply to the diagnosis-related group to which the discharge is assigned by 20 percent.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cemergency period\u201d refers to the length of time that the United States will remain in the national emergency that was declared by President Donald Trump on March 13 ( here ).\n\nThe terms \u201cweighting factor\u201d and \u201cdiagnosis-related group\u201d are part of Medicare\u2019s Prospective Payment System. Since 1983, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has used the system to put medical and surgical services into different categories known as diagnosis-related groups. According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, the system \u201ccreates a rate of payment based on the \u201caverage\u201d cost to deliver care (bundled services) to a patient with a particular disease\u201d (See page 5, here ). The CMS gives each diagnosis-related group a unique weight, which \u201creflects the average level of resources for an average Medicare patient\u201d in that group, \u201crelative to the average level of resources for all Medicare patients\u201d (See page 6). For the purposes of the payment system, in-hospital deaths are considered discharges.\n\nThe posts\u2019 claim that the payment increase applies \u201cevery time a hospital admits, discharges, or loses a patient to Covid-19\u201d is false. The 20% weighted factor increase applies only to Medicare patients and those without health insurance. It does not apply to patients with other forms of health insurance, like Medicaid or private insurance.\n\nOnly about 16% of New York City\u2019s population is enrolled in Medicare for hospital and medical insurance ( see zip file here ; here )\n\nAs for discharges of patients without insurance, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) says here , \u201cEvery health care provider who has provided treatment for uninsured COVID-19 patients on or after February 4, 2020, can request claims reimbursement through the program and will be reimbursed at Medicare rates, subject to available funding.\u201d According to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, 9.6% of New York City residents under the age of 65 are uninsured ( here ).\n\nThe weight determines the amount CMS reimburses the hospital for the patient\u2019s care. Conditions that are more expensive to manage have higher weights. For example, a heart transplant with a major complication or comorbidity has a weight of 26.4106 while an uncomplicated peptic ulcer without any major complication or comorbidity has a weight of 0.8553 (see Table 5 here ).\n\nUnder Section 3710 of the CARES Act, the diagnosis-related group weight for pulmonary edema (excess fluid in the lungs) and respiratory failure would increase by 20% from 1.2157 (See Table 5 here ) to 1.4588 if the patient\u2019s condition is a complication of COVID-19. The weight for simple pneumonia & pleurisy (inflammation of the lung tissue) with major complication or comorbidity would go up by 20% from 1.3335 to 1.6002, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nHealth economist Sherry Glied, dean of New York University\u2019s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and former Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services ( here ) explained to Reuters: \u201cCOVID-related pneumonia costs more to treat than regular pneumonia because it\u2019s so infectious.\u201d\n\nThe social media posts did not cite any evidence to support the allegation that New York hospitals are inflating their COVID-19 case numbers to bring in more money. The CMS told Reuters it does not comment on investigative activity. A CMS representative said any false claims by healthcare providers would be subject to recoupment and/or other potential civil or criminal charges.\n\nPartly false. The CARES Act calls for a 20%, rather than a 15%, increase in reimbursement when a hospital cares for a patient with COVID-19; the increase does not apply \u201cevery time,\u201d but only to Medicare recipients and the uninsured; there is no evidence that New York City hospitals are inflating their case numbers.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
