Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of Amit Shah touching the feet of Swami Nithyananda. Fact: In the image, the man seen touching the feet of Swami Nithyananda is Jagdishwar Goburdhun, the High Commissioner of Mauritius in India.

That photo is one among the set of photos that show Nithyananda with the High Commissioner of Mauritius in India \u2013 Jagdishwar Goburdhun. So, in the image, the man seen touching the feet of Swami Nithyananda isn\u2019t Amit Shah. \n\n\n\nThe same photo can also be seen in another article, and the information in the article corroborates that the man seen along with Swami Nithyananda is Jagdishwar Goburdhun (High Commissioner of Mauritius in India). \n\n\n\nTo conclude, in the image, the man seen touching the feet of Swami Nithyananda is not Amit Shah. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
