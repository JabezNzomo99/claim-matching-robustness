This was tweeted by DD News which credited the information to \u201cagency reports\u201d.\n\nHindi media outlets Navjivan, India TV and ABP News claimed the same.\n\nSeveral others \u2013 Major Gaurav Arya, India TV anchors Rajat Sharma and Sushant Sinha, ABP News journalist Sumit Awasthi, NewsX anchor Shehzad Poonawalla \u2013 also jumped on the bandwagon.\n\nA Twitter handle News Line IFE cited Gaurav Arya as the source and put out a tweet with the same claim. In an earlier Alt News Fact Check, News Line IFE was found to be the source of the unverified claim that five Chinese soldiers were killed in the clashes.\n\nOpIndia, its editor Nupur Sharma and Twitter user The Skin Doctor also promoted the \u2018news\u2019 of 43 Chinese soldiers killed.\n\nIndia Today anchor Rajdeep Sardesai wrote that ANI claimed based on \u201cChinese intercepts\u201d that \u201c43 Chinese soldiers [were] killed in the clashes\u201d. He further wrote that there hasn\u2019t been any confirmation from the Chinese side.\n\nNational Spokesperson of VHP Vijay Shankar Tiwari wrote, \u201c43 \u091a\u0940\u0928\u0940 \u0938\u0948\u0928\u093f\u0915 \u092d\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0917\u090f (43 Chinese soldiers were also killed).\u201d\n\nThe claim was based on news agency ANI\u2019s tweet which quoted \u201csources\u201d and claimed that the Chinese have suffered 43 casualties, including the dead and injured.\n\nEditor of ANI live services Ishaan Prakash quoted tweeted ANI and wrote, \u201cFirst confirmation of numbers of injured/dead in the Chinese side\u201d, which is the meaning of the word \u2018casualties\u2019.\n\nIt is to be noted that ANI did not give an exact figure on the number of Chinese soldiers who died but wrote that the number \u201c43\u201d includes both killed and wounded.\n\nWhat do the official figures state?\n\nThe Chinese government has not revealed the number of casualties on their side. The Editor-in-Chief of China-based Global Times tweeted this earlier today. Furthermore, no official figures on the Chinese casualties have been put out by the Indian army as well.\n\nDefence journalist Shiv Aroor tweeted, \u201cNO official word on Chinese casualty figures, all leaks/source stuff doing rounds.\u201d\n\nDeputy Editor at The Indian Express Sushant Singh similarly tweeted that there has been no official army statement on the number of Chinese casualties, \u201c43 or 430 or whatever\u201d.\n\nTherefore, ANI\u2019s tweet on alleged casualties on the Chinese side, both dead and injured, was misrepresented by many as \u201c43 Chinese soldiers killed\u201d in the skirmish. It is also noteworthy that neither the Chinese side nor any prominent Indian defence journalist has confirmed the number of casualties in the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA).\n\n[Update: The copy earlier claimed that Rajdeep Sardesai claimed that 43 Indian soldiers were killed.
