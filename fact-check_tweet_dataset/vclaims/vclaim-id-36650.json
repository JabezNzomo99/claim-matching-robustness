Several media outlets reported pictures of Soori with bandaged head and arms, and later without the bandages but with a garland around his neck.\n\nOn January 7, Ashish Chauhan, national secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party's student wing, Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, through his verified account, tweeted a three-fold picture of Soori with a before-and-after bandage condition accusing him of faking injuries during the violence, terming the entire episode as \"comedy show of the left comrades\".\n\nAshish's tweet has over 5,000 retweets and 8,000 likes.\n\nBollywood filmmaker and social activist Ashoke Pandit tweeted on the same lines with a similar picture. \"Yesterday JNU SFI leader Soori was admitted to hospital with 'serious injuries'.

He narrates the violence perpetrated by the masked goons and goes on to display his injuries. The injuries run from his forehead to the back of his head. His arms are without bandage now but have restricted movements.\n\n\"I had a covering on my head initially because there was profuse bleeding, once the bleeding stopped they (the doctors) asked me not to cover my head,\" Soori adds.\n\nPointing to the possibility of threats and constant intimidation faced inside the campus, he said: \"I feel threatened to go back to the campus, so I came to Kerala.\"\n\nAccording to a 'Newsminute' report, A medical record obtained from AIIMS 'Jai Prakash Narayan Trauma Centre, where Soori underwent treatment, describes the 23-year-old student's injury. The study reveals scalp lacerations, swelling and tenderness on forearms. Several JNU students were admitted to the AIIMS Trauma Center\n\nTherefore, Given the evidence, It can be ascertained that SFI activist Soori's injuries were not fake, misleading images were used to make false claims\n\nAlso Read: ABVP Activists Were Admins In Viral WhatsApp Screenshots Planning JNU Attack", "lang": "en"}
