This report is different from the official unemployment rate as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS does not specifically break out data for the 17- to 20-year-old age range. Instead, this report looks at employment status for high school graduates who are unemployed, working part-time and \u201cmarginally attached to the labor force\u201d (meaning, \u201cthose who want a job and have looked for work in the last year but have given up actively seeking work in the last four weeks\u201d). It uses the broadest measure of underemployment, called the U-6 measure of labor underutilization.", "lang": "en"}
