They were sighted in the U.S. for the first time in December 2019, when the Washington State Department of Agriculture verified two reports near the Canadian border, according to The Associated Press.\n\nA viral Facebook post falsely alleges in an image that 3,000 \u201cmurder hornets\u201d were found dead in South Carolina, despite no there being no confirmed sightings outside Washington to date. (RELATED: Can Houseflies Spread COVID-19?)\n\nAnne Lebrun, national policy manager for the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Honeybee and Pollinator Pest Programs, told AFP Fact Check that \u201cneither USDA nor WSDA has any evidence that Asian giant hornet populations are established in Washington State or anywhere else in the United States.\u201d\n\nBen Powell, a statewide apiculture and pollinator specialist at Clemson University, also told WIS News 10 that the likelihood of Asian giant hornets migrating to South Carolina is \u201cpretty low because they would have to traverse a bunch of different ecosystems.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially in the middle of the COVID-19 situation, when people are already antsy, a bunch of scary talk about an invasive species naturally will make them nervous,\u201d Brad Cavin, the chief apiary inspector for the Department of Plant Industry based at Clemson University, said in an interview with The Newsstand. \u201cBut right now this hornet is approximately 3,000 miles from South Carolina. The only confirmations we have in North America are from Washington State near the Canadian border in December 2019 and from Vancouver, British Columbia, in August 2019.\u201d\n\nFacebook posts claiming that Asian giant hornets have been found in other states such as Illinois, Texas and Louisiana have also circulated in recent weeks, AFP Fact Check reported.", "lang": "en"}
