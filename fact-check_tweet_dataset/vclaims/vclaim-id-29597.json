[1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Judge\u2019s claim that \u201cif we don\u2019t do something by 2050 koalas are going to be extinct\u201d.\n\nAAP FactCheck also examined Mr Singh\u2019s opposing claim that \u201cscientific evidence\u201d shows the number of koalas \u201care far higher than they have been in the past\u201d.\n\nConcerned by the impact of logging and the forestry industry, regional environment groups and the NSW National Parks Association (NPA) engaged ecologist David Scott to map and report on koala populations along NSW\u2019s mid north coast.\n\nScott\u2019s 2013 report led to a proposal titled \u201cA blueprint for a comprehensive reserve system for koalas on the North Coast of NSW\u201d. It was adopted in December 2014 by then NSW Labor leader Luke Foley who committed $150 million for a Great Koala National Park (GKNP) ahead of the 2015 NSW election. This GKNP proposal has since been adopted by the NSW Greens Party. [2]\n\nThe GKNP would consist of 315,000 hectares in the Coffs Harbour hinterland and would be Australia\u2019s first large national park dedicated to protecting koalas. [3]\n\nThe park would protect an estimated 4550 koalas or between 20-30 per cent of all koalas in NSW.\n\nThe GKNP became a 2019 NSW election issue because of the impact it would have on the Coffs Harbour electorate. Candidates are divided on koala populations, the negative impacts a GKNP could have on the forestry industry and any positive impacts from tourism. [1]\n\nTony Judge\u2019s 2050 koala extinction claim is based on a 2018 report by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Nature Conservation Council (NCC) which estimated koalas were on track to face extinction in NSW by 2050. The 2050 estimate was reached using advice from the federal Threatened Species Scientific Committee (TSSC) in 2012, which listed koalas in NSW, Queensland and ACT as \u201cvulnerable to extinction\u201d based on two population estimates.\n\n\u201cThe TSSC estimated a 33 per cent koala population decline from 31,400 to 21,000 across the two decades from 1990-2010. The worst-case extinction year would be 2050 based on linear extrapolation from these two points,\u201d the WWF/NCC report said. [4]\n\nNCC CEO Kate Smolski said \u201ckoala numbers across the state, including on the north coast, have plummeted up to 50 per cent since 1990\u201d. \"There are now possibly as few as 15,000 left in the wild. On current trends and without urgent action koalas are on track to become extinct by mid-century.\u201d [5]\n\nRichard Kingsford, a professor of environmental science at the University of NSW, said while the WWF/NCC methodology was sound, the report\u2019s 2050 prediction was \u201cblunt\u201d. \u201cIt's clearly identified that clearing has gone on - that seems incontrovertible - I think the more difficult leap is what does that mean in terms of potential extinction of species.\u201d [6]\n\nA spokesman for NSW Environment Minister Gabrielle Upton discounted the WWF/NCC report. \u201cThe NSW government\u2019s koala strategy - the biggest commitment by any state government to secure koalas in the wild - will provide more natural habitat for koalas, tackle diseases, improve research and fix roadkill hotspots. The NSW government has committed $45 million for this strategy. The WWF and NCC are simply playing politics and scaremongering.\u201d [7]\n\nBased on the evidence AAP FactCheck found Mr Judge\u2019s claim to be mostly true, as Prof Kingsford and Ms Upton discounted some or all of the WCC/NCC report on which Mr Judge based his claim.\n\nThere was little evidence to support Mr Singh\u2019s claim \u201cthe numbers (of koalas) are far higher than they have been in the past\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cpractically impossible\u201d to get an accurate count of koalas, according to the Australia Koala Foundation. Instead modelling is used to estimate koala numbers by examining koala habitats and the spread and density of koalas across habitats. [8]\n\nThere is however consensus that koala numbers are declining.\n\nAccording to a senate report the estimated koala population before European settlement was as high as 10 million. [9]\n\nThe Journal of Conservation Biogeography estimated an average decline of 24 per cent over the past three generations. [10]\n\nThe senate report concluded koalas had \u201cundergone marked decline over three generations\u201d. [9]\n\nThe Australian Government Department of Environment's Threatened Species Scientific Committee (TSSC) told a 2011 senate inquiry there were approximately 300,000 koalas in 2010, down from 430,000 in 1990. [9]\n\nIn South Australia and Victoria koala populations are \u201cflourishing\u201d and are not listed as vulnerable or threatened, although numbers are still declining according to the Journal of Conservation Biogeography. The decline in Queensland, NSW and the ACT is considered severe. [9 pages 17 & 23] [10]\n\nEcological historian and forester Vic Jurskis told ABC radio in 2017 that koalas existed in sparse numbers prior to European settlement and that the koala decline was not a crisis as populations had fallen from unsustainably high levels resulting from forest mismanagement.\n\n\u201cA stable (koala) population is the right size. If koalas are increasing there\u2019s something wrong and inevitably they\u2019re going to decline,\u201d Mr Jurskis said. [11]\n\nThere are studies that have included references to possible increases in koala numbers in some areas in NSW.\n\nA 2018 report commissioned by the NSW Department of Primary Industries in 2018 found there were up to 10 times the number of koalas previously thought to be in NSW\u2019s north-east forests. [12]\n\nA 2015 paper gave the outlook for koals in NSW, Queensland and the ACT as \"continuing overall decline\" but cited earlier research that koalas around the New England Tableland hinterland were \"relatively stable with some indications of a local increase\". [13]\n\nIn another 2015 paper, researchers stated they believed there had been an increase in koala numbers around Campbelltown, south-west of Sydney. [14]\n\nAnd a 2016 paper made a tentative finding that koalas around the Bermagui/Mumbulla area in south-eastern NSW may be increasing. [15]\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes Mr Singh\u2019s claim \u201cthe numbers (of koalas) are far higher than they have been in the past\u201d is mostly false as there are papers which have found possible increases in koala numbers in some areas, however there is no evidence of an increase in the NSW koala population.", "lang": "en"}
