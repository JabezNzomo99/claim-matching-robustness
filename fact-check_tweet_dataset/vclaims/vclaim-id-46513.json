The claim is false; the clip has circulated in reports about a murder in Bangladesh, not India, in 2017; the reports stated the victim was a Muslim man called Abu Sayeed; the video corresponded with Google Street View images of a city in Bangladesh.\n\nThe 12-second video was shared in this (graphic warning) Facebook post published on January 12, 2019. It has been viewed more than 4,000 times.\n\nThe video shows a group of men assaulting a man lying on the ground, before a man wearing a white skullcap attacks him with a large rock.\n\nThe Hindi-language text in a red header and footer overlaid on the video translates to English as: \u201cBengal: Muslim mob in Bengal stone-crushed a Hindu.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s caption, written in a mix of Hindi and English, translates as: \u201cDangerous, what's your take on this issue?

An \u201cUpazila\u201d means an administrative region.\n\nFurther keyword searches found the same clip in this April 2, 2017 post on a Facebook page called \u2018Cumilla Division\u2019, which is run by local Bangladeshi online news website Comillarbarta.com.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison matching a frame from the video in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the \u2018Cumilla Division\u2019 post (R):\n\nThe \u2018Cumilla Division\u2019 Facebook post has a Bengali-language caption which translates to English as: \u201cA young man named Abu Saeed (24) was killed by a terrorist attack in Daudkandi.
