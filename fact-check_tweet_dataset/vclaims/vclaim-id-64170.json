Rather, they are pictures of victims of violence in South Africa, some of which antedate the founding of the BLM movement, and at least one of which has previously been used out of context and misrepresented in a social media meme.\n\nThe woman pictured at the top left of this collage is 75-year-old Anne Ells, who was beaten and robbed in her home in Universitas, a suburb of the city of Bloemfontein in South Africa, in 2014.\n\nThe woman pictured at the bottom right of this collage is 75-year-old Renske Cowan, who \u201csuffered a broken nose, extensive bruising to her face and an injured throat when an armed attacker assaulted her after breaking into her daughter\u2019s humble dwelling in Primrose, Germiston,\u201d South Africa.\n\nThe identity of the man pictured at the top right of this collage is unknown to us, but his photograph has been posted multiple places online as depicting a victim of South African farm attacks:\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know the provenance of the other two photographs, but they appear to be of similar ilk, part of a collection of pictures depicting violent attacks in South Africa that someone repurposed as allegedly documenting beatings by a \u201cBlack Lives Matter hate group.\u201d We have not found any instance of any of these photographs being identified elsewhere (i.e., outside of this particular meme) as depicting attacks connected with BLM or taking place in the U.S.\n\nThe photograph of Ells had previously been misrepresented in a similar meme that asserted she was a Swedish woman who had been raped by \u201cimmigrants from the third world\u201d (i.e., Muslims):", "lang": "en"}
