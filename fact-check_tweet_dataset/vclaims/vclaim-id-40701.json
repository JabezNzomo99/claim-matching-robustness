Fisher, who parodied Tom Cruise in the 2008 film \u201cSuperhero Movie,\u201d originally shared this video to his Twitter account in August 2019 with the question, \u201cWhat if Tom Cruise ran for president?\u201d:\n\nWhen this video was first released, Vulture labeled it one of the month\u2019s \u201cmust-see comedy shorts,\u201d writing that Fisher\u2019s impression was \u201cpitch-perfect.\u201d\n\nFisher also created a mock-up for a Tom Cruise 2020 website. Although the website doesn\u2019t carry a disclaimer labeling it a parody, all of the social media links on the site redirect to Fisher\u2019s pages. Moreover, the page dedicated to Cruise\u2019s \u201cplatform\u201d is a little too on-the-nose to be believable:", "lang": "en"}
