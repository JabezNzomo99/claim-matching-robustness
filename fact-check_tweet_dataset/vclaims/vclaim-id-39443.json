Juxtaposed with Nehru\u2019s image, he posted what looks like an e-paper clip in admiration of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and termed him \u201cthe real hero of India.\u201d\n\nIn the picture tweeted by Sirsa, Nehru is being given a kiss by his niece Nayantara Sehgal on his arrival at London airport in 1955. The woman on their right is Sehgal\u2019s mother, Vijaylakshmi Pandit, who was the High Commissioner to the UK at that time. Alt News had debunked this image last year as well when BJP IT Cell Head Amit Malviya also shared the photograph to malign Nehru.\n\nA video of Nehru\u2019s arrival posted by vintage television company British Path\u00e9 on their YouTube channel provides a clearer context. The peck can be seen at the 27th second of the clip.\n\nIndia\u2019s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal has often been targetted on social media. The attempt at character assassination not only takes place with the help of false narratives but also fake images.\n\nImage of an actor playing Nehru shared as an actual image of the former PM\n\nRecently, another purported photograph of Jawaharlal Nehru was doing rounds on social media, attempting to show him intimate with a woman. From a Facebook group, We Support PM Modi, this image was circulated with the caption \u2013 \u201c\u0906\u091c\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0932\u0921\u093c\u093e\u0908 \u0932\u0921\u093c\u0924\u0947 \u0928\u0947\u0939\u0930\u0941 \u091a\u093e\u091a\u093e (Chacha Nehru fighting the battle of Independence).\u201d It was shared over 600 times.\n\nThis image is a shot from a play \u2018Drawing the Line\u2019 and the man in the photograph is not Nehru but theatre actor Silas Carson with actress Lucy Black who played the role of Edwina Mountbatten. Details about the play are available on the website of London\u2019s Hampstead Theatre.\n\nThe country\u2019s first Prime Minister is one of the favourite targets of social media\u2019s right-wing machinery. Decades after his death, Nehru\u2019s photographs are not only shared with false narratives but often photoshopped to propagate his image as an immoral man.\n\nWatch the following Alt News video for more such examples where misleading and photoshopped images were used to target Jawaharlal Nehru.", "lang": "en"}
