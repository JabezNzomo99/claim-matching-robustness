A fact check by Alt News now establishes that the man was carrying a wallet and a phone in his hand. The Logical Indian has updated the headline to correct the factual error.]\n\n\n\nA WhatsApp forward, a tweet from a verified account, claiming that one of the Jamia students seen in the viral CCTV footage is Shadab Farooq, who got shot by the Jamia shooter, is doing rounds on social media.\n\nThe tweet by Vikrant Kumar, a founding member of online news portal 'Lopak', asks the question whether the person seen in the video is Shadab.\n\nThis claim has been retweeted over 6,000 times and has also gone viral on Facebook.\n\nSeveral videos propagating the misleading claim has been doing the rounds in social media.\n\n\n\nJamia student seen in viral footage is Shadab Farooq, who got shot by the Jamia Shooter\n\nShadab Farooq and the student seen in the video are two different people.\n\nThe person in the video has been identified as Mohammad Ashraf Bhat, a PhD candidate from the Political Science Department in Social Science faculty under Professor Kadloor Savitri at the Jamia Millia Islamia University.\n\nThe Logical Indian tried reaching out to Bhat. His friends confirmed his identity but stated that he did not want to be contacted. He has taken down his social media accounts.\n\nFacebook posts identifying him have also surfaced.\n\n\"I was the student of the same department from 2015-17. Bhat got into PhD in 2017. Although we never contacted each other. My juniors, batchmates and seniors are still there who helped in recognising him,\" Rahul Tiwari a former student of the Political Science department at the Jamia Millia Islamia University told The Logical Indian.\n\nOn the official website of Jamia Millia Islamia University, Bhat's name has been listed out amongst the PhD students.\n\n\n\nA reply from one of Shadab Farooq's friend to the viral tweet places him elsewhere on the night of 15th December and not on the Jamia campus.\n\n\n\nHe was at the Jashn-e-Rekhta, which is an Urdu poetry event, till 6:30 pm that was held at Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, India Gate, New Delhi on 15th December, Monazza Aarfa told The Logical Indian.\n\nAarfa also provided us with pictures from the event.\n\nThe date and time stamp clearly shows that Farooq was a part of that event.\n\nTherefore, It can be ascertained that Shadab is not the person from the CCTV footage.\n\n\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343", "lang": "en"}
