Missing in the list are Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Daman & Diu and Punjab.\n\nSecond, would be the two odd entries in the list - namely \u2018Badranagar Habeli\u2019 and \u2018Simon\u2019. Given that no such state or union territory exist in India, we took our best guess as to what they mean and came up with Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Sikkim, respectively, given that these two states were also missing in the list.\n\nThird, would be the fact that these dates seem to match the dates for 2014 General Elections in India almost exactly. You can find the dates, as reported by News18 here.\n\nIt seems the fake news factory has complacently tried to pass off 2014 Lok Sabha elections' dates as the dates for the upcoming elections.\n\nIndia, known as the world\u2019s largest democracy, is credited to hosting the world\u2019s largest elections. During the 2014 general elections, around 814 million voters were registered to vote as reported by The Economist.", "lang": "en"}
