Trump also briefly discussed his negative test result with reporters after the fact.

In fact it was sooo negative, that the doctors said they never saw a negative number so low!\u201d one viral Facebook post quotes Trump as saying about his COVID-19 test. \u201cIt was perfect; perfectly negative. Actually, it was hugely perfectly negative. And tremendous too! My doctor said it was the best and greatest score of anyone who has ever taken the test.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Trump ever made the statement. It does not appear on his Twitter accounts, and it could not be found in any transcripts of press briefings since Trump tested negative for COVID-19. Nor have any media outlets attributed the remark to him.\n\nIn a March 16 press conference, Trump said that he took the test after receiving numerous questions about it from reporters, saying, \u201cThe results came back, I believe, the following day. And we tested negative.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
