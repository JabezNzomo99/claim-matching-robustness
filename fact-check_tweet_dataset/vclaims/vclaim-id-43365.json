But it\u2019s not a vaccine that would prevent Covid-19.\n\u2022 None Experts stressed that misinformation during the coronavirus crisis would only work against efforts to slow the spread of the pandemic. \n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa went into lockdown on 27 March 2020, as the government tries to control the spread of the new coronavirus. There are now\n\nconfirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country, with\n\nhe said \u201cimmediate, swift and extraordinary action is required if we are to prevent a human catastrophe of enormous proportions\u201d.\n\n\u2019s executive mayor, Mzwandile Masina, had another solution to the pandemic. In his 18 March\n\n, he proposed using the municipality\u2019s emergency funds \u201cto procure the vaccine Inferon B from Cuba\u201d.\n\nMasina did not respond to our numerous requests for evidence of a \u201cvaccine\u201d. So Africa Check went looking.\n\nCurrently no vaccine for Covid-19\n\n. \u201cVaccines contain the same germs that cause disease \u2026 But they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don\u2019t make you sick.\u201d\n\n: \u201cA vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.\u201d\n\nAccording to the\n\n, there are still \u201cno specific vaccines or treatments for Covid-19\u201d.\n\n\u201cPossible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat Covid-19,\u201d\n\nin Johannesburg, told Africa Check that in the best case scenario a\n\nfor Covid-19 is expected in 12 to 18 months.\n\nMasina referred to \u201cInferon B\u201d as a vaccine in his speech but an\n\na photo a few hours before delivering the speech, captioned \u201cInterferon B\u201d, of boxes of interferon alpha-2b. This is a man made form of an interferon, a substance produced in various forms by the human immune system. Interferon alpha-2b is a cytokine.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a chemical produced by the white blood cells, your immune cells, that helps to protect you against infection including viruses,\u201d said immunologist Dr Elizabeth Mayne, who works at South Africa\u2019s\n\nBut interferon alpha-2b, according to Mayne, is \u201cdefinitively not a vaccine\u201d. \u201cThere is no good scientific data to show that it will protect you from getting the infection.\"\n\nThe day before Masina made his claim, Cuba\u2019s foreign affairs ministry released a statement that \u201cthere is no preventive vaccine or specific treatment, at this time, for the new coronavirus\u201d.\n\nIt said, however, that it was producing interferon alpha-2b \u201cin addition to another group of drugs that are included in protocols for treating patients with this disease and the complications that may arise\u201d.\n\nInterferon alpha-2b and other interferons have been used to treat previous strains of coronavirus because of their ability to boost cells\u2019 natural defence mechanisms. They\n\nto share similarities with the 2019 coronavirus.\n\nBut the treatment can have serious side effects. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists\n\n: \u201cAlmost all patients experience adverse effects at some time during the course of interferon alfa therapy.\u201d\n\nMayne described the common side effects as: \u201cAll of the things that make you feel pretty miserable when you have the flu: the tiredness, the fatigue, not wanting to eat, things like that\u201d. The side effects of interferon therapy mean that \u201ca lot of people actually can\u2019t take it\u201d.\n\nNo data to support use of interferons\n\n) that while substances such as interferon alpha are being used to treat the new coronavirus, \u201cthere are no data to support their use\u201d. The website is a\n\ncompiled by expert medical editors and based on published, peer-reviewed studies.\n\nCurrent and future clinical trials may show that interferon treatment is effective. But Milpark Hospital\u2019s Shoul said there was no reason for Ekurhuleni to buy the drug, and that it was unlikely to be useful.\n\nInstead, he advised people to follow guidelines from the\n\n. It was important \u201cto have one focal point for information\u201d to make sure that people do not receive conflicting information and become unsure of what to trust.\n\nMayne had a similar message. \u201cAny misinformation in a crisis is going to be counterproductive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt confuses people, and it diverts time away from what we should be concentrating on, which is reinforcing the NICD guidelines.\u201d\n\nConclusion Interferon alpha-2b is not a vaccine for the new coronavirus.\n\nSouth African mayor Mzwandile Masina said in his state of the city address that there was a \u201cvaccine\u201d for Covid-19 called interferon alpha-2b.\n\nThis is incorrect \u2013 the drug is not a vaccine that would\n\nCovid-19. It has been used to\n\nprevious strains of coronavirus. While it is being considered as a possible treatment for the new virus there are no definitive results from clinical trials.\n\nThe World Health Organization says there are currently \u201cno specific vaccines or treatments for Covid-19.\u201d Possible vaccines and drug treatments are being tested in clinical trials.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we only get information on Covid-19 and its treatments from credible sources.
