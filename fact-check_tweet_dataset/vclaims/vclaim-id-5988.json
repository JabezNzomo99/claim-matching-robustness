The show\u2019s comic book origins, camp approach to the superhero genre, pop art sensibilities, parade of special guest villains, and unique two-night-a-week cliffhanger and resolution format all contributed to a massive cultural phenomenon that encompassed not just television, but also a feature-length movie, books, clothing, toys and games, trading cards, posters, and myriad other Batman-themed products.\n\nA significant factor in the tremendous popularity of the Batman TV series was composer Neal Hefti\u2019s catchy and memorable theme music, which was \u201cpart serious, part silly; just like the series,\u201d combining bass guitar, low brass, and prominent percussion to create a driving, pulsing rhythm that played against animated images of the Caped Crusader and Robin, the Boy Wonder, dispatching a bevy of villainous thugs with their fists to the accompaniment of discordant brass accents and cartoon dialogue balloons reading \u201cSOCK!\u201d \u201cPOW!\u201d \u201cZOCK!\u201d \u201cWHAP!\u201d \u201cBIFF!\u201d and \u201cOOOOF!\u201d The theme\u2019s lyrics consisted of a single word, \u201cBatman,\u201d repeated eleven times by a chorus of voices:\n\nSome years after the series ended in 1968, the rumor arose that the lyrics (such as they were) to the Batman theme song were produced not by human voices, but by brass instruments:\n\nThis claim was promulgated by series star Adam West himself in his 1994 autobiography, Back to the Batcave:\n\nEveryone was talking or writing about us, wanting an interview, trying to understand and explain the appeal, raving about the innovative angles for bad the lavish sets or Neal Hefti\u2019s catchy jazz score. Old pals would call to congratulate me and also to ask, \u201cAre those horns or voices saying \u2018Batman\u2019 during your theme song?\u201d (They were horns.)\n\n\n\nHowever, as chronicled in the 1996 book TV\u2019s Biggest Hits by Jon Burlingame, who interviewed composer Neal Hefti, the \u201cBatman\u201d lyrics were indeed voiced by a human chorus, not horns:\n\nHefti recalled the makeup of the band: two trumpets, four trombones, two keyboards, four guitars, a bass, and two drums. The eight singers (four sopranos, four tenors) \u201csang in perfect unison, not octaves apart,\u201d Hefti said. \u201cThe tenors were up there screeching, so they sounded like boy sopranos.\u201d He offered to create separate tracks, so that [producer William] Dozier could eliminate the voices if he desired, \u201cbut he liked the idea,\u201d Hefti says, so the chorus stayed.\n\n\n\nLest anyone think that Hefti was misremembering or engaging in some latter-day revisionism thirty years after the fact, we note that he referenced the use of a chorus for the Batman theme music all the way back in a Los Angeles Times article:\n\nWhat is the Batman theme? Basically it is a traditional blues. It is composed of a two-note phrase repeated six times on the first, fourth, and fifth notes of the scale. How batavistic can you get? \u201cI wrote the lyrics, too,\u201d [says Hefti,] so I get double credit on it. As you know, the lyrics consist of the title repeated six times [sic]. One of the choir members on the recording session wrote on his part: \u2018Word and Music by Neal Hefti.'\u201d", "lang": "en"}
