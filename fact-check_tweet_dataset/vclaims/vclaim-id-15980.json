Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post\n\nClaim: In 2012, when the \u2018Time\u2019 magazine called Manmohan Singh as \u201cThe Underachiever\u201d, BJP has condemned it. But, in 2019, when the same magazine called PM Modi as \u201cIndia\u2019s Divider in Chief\u201d. Congress party is backing the foreign media. Fact: The BJP as a party did not support Manmohan Singh. The \u2018Time\u2019 magazine story was used by the BJP to criticize Manmohan Singh. Ravi Shankar Prasad also demanded Singh\u2019s resignation. But, few leaders like the then Madhya Pradesh\u2019s CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Madhya Pradesh\u2019s BJP President Prabhat Jha supported Manmohan Singh. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen searched for the issue on Google with the keywords \u201cBJP supports Manmohan the underachiever\u2019, many newspaper articles on this issue come in the search results. According to some articles in India Today and The Hindu, BJP attacked the Congress showing the \u2018Time\u2019 magazine. BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also held a press conference on this issue, where he criticized Manmohan for the corruption in his government. So, it is not true that BJP has not attacked Manmohan when \u2018Time\u2019 called Manmohan him \u201cThe Underachiever\u201d\n\nBut, according to the Business Line article, few BJP leaders like Madhya Pradesh\u2019s CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Madhya Pradesh\u2019s BJP President Prabhat Jha supported Manmohan Singh. So, there are some individual leaders who supported him, but as a party, BJP criticized Manmohan using the \u2018Time\u2019 magazine\u2019 story.\n\nBelow comments are taken from the Business Line article:\n\n\n\nRavi Shankar Prasad: \u201cIt is sad that India is perceived as the one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Dr Manmohan Singh\u2019s Government is the most corrupt.\u201d\n\nMukhtar Abbas Naqvi: \u201cDefinitely, he is not an achiever\u2026. All that he has achieved is corruption, scam and bad governance.\u201d\n\nPrabhat Jha: \u201cNo foreign magazine has a right to look down upon the Prime Minister of India\u201d\n\nShivraj Singh Chouhan: \u201cwe do not need a certificate from a foreign media publication for our Prime Minister\u201d\n\nTo sum it up, BJP attacked Manmohan when he was called \u2018The Underachiever\u2019 by \u2018Time\u2019 magazine. Only a few BJP leaders supported him.", "lang": "en"}
