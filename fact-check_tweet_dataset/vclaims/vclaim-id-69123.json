Ann Wagner for not responding to his demands to have a debate and tied it in with her unavailability to constituents: \"Rep. Ann Wagner, a three-term incumbent, has never held a town hall in the Second District.\"\n\nGiven the use of the word \"never,\" we found VanOstran\u2019s contention surprising \u2014 three terms is a long time to have never held a town hall. We decided to see if this was true.\n\nWe began by looking at the Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition for \"town hall.\" It states that a town hall is \"an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members.\"\n\nWe reached out to VanOstran\u2019s campaign for their evidence. Campaign manager Claire Botnick said the VanOstran camp simply called Wagner\u2019s camp to ask about it, and a representative from her office said Wagner has never held a public in-person town hall.\n\nThe Wagner campaign declined an offer to comment on the record, so we examined the information we could find on our own.\n\nWagner has held multiple town halls conducted via telephone (known as tele-town halls), according to her social media accounts, coverage in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and St. Louis Public Radio and an email exchange with one of her constituents.\n\nHowever, finding in-person town halls conducted by Wagner was more difficult. A quick search of the term \"town hall\" on both Wagner\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts showed eight events where Wagner described herself at a town hall.\n\nBeyond social media, we scrolled through articles about public events attended by Wagner that might have resembled town halls. We found no examples of events that fit the traditional definition of town halls.\n\nBottom line: We could not find evidence of an in-person, public town hall where Wagner took questions from constituents. At most, she has held town halls that were limited to a private group of employees at a specific company.\n\nThe employees who attend \"know that their employer has arranged for and endorsed the visit, and that therefore assertive questions are not welcome,\" Smith said.\n\nShe has held telephone-based town halls, as well as private events for particular companies\u2019 employees. But experts say that a town hall traditionally involves a public official inviting any constituent to gather in a public space and ask him or her questions.", "lang": "en"}
