The post attracted over 14,000 shares at the time of writing this article.\n\nThe photograph was shared with the identical narrative from other Facebook pages as well \u2013\u0915\u091f\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092f\u0941\u0935\u093e \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938andI am Congress We are Congress. Individual users on Twitter also circulated the imagery.\n\nAlt News reverse searched the image on Google and found that it pertains to a rally addressed by former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda in Sonepat in 2013.\n\nThe original image was shot by Getty Images for Hindustan Times. It is available on the website of Getty Images, captioned as \u2013 \u201cSONEPAT, INDIA \u2013 NOVEMBER 10: Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda addresses Haryana Shakti Rally at Gohana on November 10, 2013 in Sonepat, India.\u201d\n\nCongress President Rahul Gandhi indeed addressed a rally in Bikaner ahead of the state elections scheduled to be held on December 7. But the viral image does not pertain to the aforestated event and is an attempt to mislead social media users.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an isolated incident of Facebook page Rahul Gandhi for PM circulating misinformation in favour of the Congress. In July this year, it falsely claimed that Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Lok Sabha speech was seen by 48 lakh viewers. Alt News, however, found that Lok Sabha TV does not produce any data concerning the viewership of the channel.\n\nRahul Gandhi for PM had also shared fake news suggesting that former US President Barack Obama endorsed Rahul Gandhi for prime ministership. In multiple other instances, it ascribed false quotes to BJP leaders, including Ravinderjit Singh, Ashiwini Chowbey and Sambit Patra.\n\nDespite being called out in the past, the Facebook page continues to peddle disinformation. It is pertinent that posts shared by Rahul Gandhi for PM are not taken at face value and cross-checked for verification.", "lang": "en"}
