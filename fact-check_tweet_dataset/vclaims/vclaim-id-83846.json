The image is actually of an elephant in South Africa\u2019s Pilanesberg National Park and the people in the vehicle were unharmed.\n\nThe picture posted on Facebook on August 30, 2015 has more than 110,700 shares and 40,000 reactions and shows an elephant trampling a Volkswagen hatchback on a scenic, unpaved road.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cHunter Ian Gibson was trampled to death by elephant he was tracking to kill for ivory yesterday\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook page, with more than 3.4 million followers, posted the picture with this text: \u201cIan Gibson had been leading a hunt in Chewore North, Zimbabwe, when he was killed.\u201d\n\nGibson was killed in Zimbabwe by an elephant while leading a hunt in 2015 according to this post from his former employers, but the image above has nothing to do with his death.\n\nThe picture was taken in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, by Armand Grobler in 2014, when a couple visiting the safari park were surprised by an elephant, as related in an article on the park\u2019s official website.\n\nGrobler took a number of pictures at the scene, including the image in the misleading meme, his mother Theresa Grobler confirmed to AFP Friday, while her son was away in the Kalahari.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that the photos have been photographed by Armand while he was on a FGASA course in the Pilanesberg National Park. And I can also assure you that no one was killed during this encounter.\u201d\n\nArmand Grobler meanwhile described the experience as scary but incredible in a Facebook post from August 22, 2014.", "lang": "en"}
