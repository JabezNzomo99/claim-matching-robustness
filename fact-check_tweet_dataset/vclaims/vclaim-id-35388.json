It\u2019s also entirely made-up.\n\nThe headline appears in a Feb. 9 story on Trump Train Pro News, a website we\u2019ve fact-checked for recycling bogus quotes about President Donald Trump before.\n\nPosts sharing the headline were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWhile the headline broadcasts a fake Smith quote, the text of the Trump Train Pro News story is a slightly altered representation of criticisms Smith lobbed at then-candidate Trump in 2016.\n\nThe Trump Train Pro News story lifts almost verbatim from an authentic news report published Aug. 3, 2016, by news.com.au, an Australian news outlet. The report features comments Smith made about Trump while promoting \"Suicide Squad,\" a movie about supervillains.\n\nThe quotes Smith gave to news.com.au made headlines in mainstream British and U.S. news outlets as well, including the Guardian, Time, the Hill and the Washington Post.\n\nAccording to the report, Smith said he hoped Trump wouldn\u2019t win the 2016 election and condemned what he called a \"separatist non-inclusive xenophobic, racist wave that is sweeping the globe.\" He said he had no tolerance for Trump\u2019s comments about women and wondered why they didn\u2019t seem to diminish Trump\u2019s support.\n\n\"For a man to be able to publicly refer to a woman as a fat pig, that makes me teary. And for people to applaud, that is absolutely f------ insanity to me,\" Smith told news.com.au.\n\nIn the Trump Train Pro News story, that same quote \u2014 and others from Smith\u2019s news.com.au interview \u2014 appears as though it was filtered through a thesaurus machine. The Trump Train Pro News version of Smith\u2019s quote about Trump\u2019s comments on women reads:\n\n\"F\u043er a man t\u043e h\u0430v\u0435 the \u0430b\u0456l\u0456t\u0443 t\u043e \u0455tr\u0430\u0456ghtf\u043erw\u0430rdl\u0443 intimate a w\u043em\u0430n as a f\u0430t \u0440\u0456g, th\u0430t m\u0430k\u0435\u0455 me m\u0456\u0455\u0435r\u0430bl\u0435.

Other fact-checkers debunked the same false headline when it appeared on another site.\n\nSmith was critical of Trump throughout the promotional tour for the August 2016 film.\n\n\"As painful as it is to hear Donald Trump talk, and as embarrassing it is as an American to hear him talk, I think it\u2019s good,\" he said during another press event. \"We get to hear it, we get to know who people are, and now we get to cleanse it out of our country.\"\n\nThe actor made similar remarks about \"cleansing\" racism from the United States during a \"Tonight Show\" interview that same month.\n\nBut there\u2019s no proof that he said, \"I\u2019m not afraid to say that Trump and his supporters are ba\u2026\"", "lang": "en"}
