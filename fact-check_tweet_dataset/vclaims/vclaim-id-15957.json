The photo has been doctored; in the original the actress is holding a sign endorsing opposition candidates.\n\nThe misleading post has been shared over 7,000 times since being posted here and here on May 7.\n\nThe photo shows Cynthia Patag, known in the Philippines for her comedic roles, holding a sign that says \u201cZERO VOTE\u201d written across the faces of eight opposition candidates.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\n\n\nIn a combination of Tagalog and English, the caption in the post reads: \u201cZERO VOTE, NEVER AGAIN! LET US NOT ALLOW THE Lpigs TO RULE OUR LAND AGAIN!\u201d\n\n\u201cLpigs\u201d is a reference to the Liberal Party, the main opposition in the Philippines. Here is a link to their website.\n\nThe sign also lists the names of eight opposition candidates and highlights certain letters from each name in yellow to spell out \u201cOCHO GAGO\u201d, which when translated to English, means \u201cEIGHT FOOLS\u201d.\n\nThe statement at the bottom of the poster, when translated to English, says: \u201cEasy to remember: EIGHT FOOLS\u201d.\n\n\u201cEight fools\u201d is a play on the name of an opposition alliance called \u201cOtso diretso\u201d (Straight eight). Here is the official website of Otso Diretso.\n\nThe Philippines held midterm elections on May 13, 2019. Here is an AFP report on the voting.\n\nAFP searched Patag's official Facebook page and found this photo from April 29, 2019.\n\nIn the post, Patag is in the same pose, against the same background and wearing the same clothes, but the sign she is holding is in support of candidates from the Otso Diretso alliance.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe text on the poster translates to English as: \u201cVOTE STRAIGHT OTSODiRETSO (MATH GRAD). Makalintal. Alejano. Tanada. Hilbay. Gutoc. Roxas. Aquino. Diokno. Let\u2019s bring Straight Eight to the Senate. FIGHT!\u201d\n\n\u201cMath grad\u201d refers to the phrase which is composed from putting together the first letter of the names of the candidates listed on the sign.\n\nThe same group of candidates are listed in the same order on the Otso Diretso website here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the eight candidates from the Otso Diretso website:\n\nAFP has previously debunked a similar claim that Patag had attacked opposition candidates.", "lang": "en"}
