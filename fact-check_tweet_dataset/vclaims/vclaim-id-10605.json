In 1927, Donald Trump\u2019s father would have been 21 years old, and not yet a well-known figure. Multiple sources report his residence at the time \u2014 and throughout his life \u2014 at the same address. To be clear, this is not proof that Trump senior \u2014 who would later go on to become a millionaire real estate developer \u2014 was a member of the Ku Klux Klan or even in attendance at the event. Despite sharing lawyers with the other men, it\u2019s conceivable that he may have been an innocent bystander, falsely named, or otherwise the victim of mistaken identity during or following a chaotic event. A person answering calls at the N.Y.C. Police Department\u2019s Records Section said that arrest reports dating that far back were not available in any form.\n\nBoingBoing included a copy of the New York Times article, with the source material available behind a paywall on the New York Times\u2018 web-based archive. That article reported a May 1927 \u201cfree-for-all battle\u201d involving 100 policemen and 1,000 Klansmen in Jamaica, Queens:\n\nThe elder Trump\u2019s name appeared once in the article, at the end of a portion headed \u201cPrisoners are Arraigned.\u201d Details about charges filed against other individuals were included, but Trump was simply said to have been \u201cdischarged\u201d (with no further information about his overall involvement or lack thereof):\n\nAs BoingBoing stated, the information available in the article made it difficult to figure out whether Trump\u2019s father was directly involved in the melee or was simply a bystander who coincidentally found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Other persons were charged with various infractions ranging from felonious assault to disorderly behavior, but Trump wasn\u2019t mentioned as having been cited for even minor criminal charges. According to BoingBoing, New York City no longer holds any information about arrests dating as far back as 1927, making it impossible to independently verify the original Times report.\n\nOn 22 September 2015, the New York Times published an interview with Donald Trump, a transcript of which was prefaced with the following:\n\nThat interview also included the following exchange on the subject of Fred Trump\u2019s arrest:\n\nQ. Have you seen this story about police arresting a Fred Trump who lived at that Devonshire address in 1927 after a Ku Klux Klan rally turned violent? A. Totally false. We lived on Wareham. The Devonshire \u2014 I know there is a road Devonshire but I don\u2019t think my father ever lived on Devonshire. Q. The Census shows that he lived there with your mother there. But regardless, you never heard about that story? A. It never happened. And by the way, I saw that it was one little website that said it. It never happened. And they said there were no charges, no nothing. It\u2019s unfair to mention it, to be honest, because there were no charges. They said there were charges against other people, but there were absolutely no charges, totally false \u2026 Somebody showed me that website \u2014 it was a little website and somebody did that. By the way, did you notice that there were no charges? Well, if there are no charges that means it shouldn\u2019t be mentioned \u2026 Because my father, there were no charges against him, I don\u2019t know about the other people involved. But there were zero charges against him. So assuming it was him \u2014 I don\u2019t even think it was him, I never even heard about it. So it\u2019s really not fair to mention. It never happened.\n\nThe author of the piece wrote that Trump revisited the topic \u201cunprompted,\u201d interjecting to say that:\n\nAnd by the way, my father was not involved, was never charged and I never even heard this before. What? It comes out on a website and you are going to write it on The New York Times? It shouldn\u2019t be written because it never happened, No. 1. And No. 2, there was nobody charged.\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible the elder Trump attended the event along with KKK supporters and Klansmen, it\u2019s also possible he was minding his own business in his own neighborhood and got swept up by police after unknowingly finding himself in the middle of an enormous brawl.", "lang": "en"}
