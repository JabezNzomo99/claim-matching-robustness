One video that drew a skeptical eye supposedly showed the NBA icon playing Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d or \u201cPiano Sonata No. 14\u201d:\n\nThis is a video from a 2013 advertisement for Lenovo technology company. In the final seconds of the above-displayed video, the logo for \u201cLenovo\u201d appears on the screen. This video, which features Bryant and the Loring String Quartet playing the \u201cMoonlight Sonata,\u201d won a Bronze Telly Award.\n\nWhile commercials often stretch the truth in order to draw in viewers (we\u2019ve covered several commercials that were later circulated as genuine videos), Bryant was truly capable of playing the \u201cMoonlight Sonata.\u201d In fact, the above-displayed commercial was reportedly inspired by a brief video Bryant posted to Facebook in 2013 with the message: \u201cJust got to Miami, felt like the Sonata. Thanks to my lil bro Darius for taking video.\u201d\n\nBryant shared another social media post a few months earlier that showed him sitting at a piano. That image was captioned, \u201cBeethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata calms me down when I reach my breaking point.\u201d\n\nReporter Ramona Shelburne told the story of Bryant\u2019s love for the \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d in a 2016 article published by ESPN. Shelburne explained that Bryant first learned to play it as a gift for his wife Vanessa in 2011. The two were heading for a divorce and Bryant wanted make a grand gesture to keep her.\n\nAnd if playing the composition wasn\u2019t enough, Bryant learned this classic piece by ear.\n\n\u201cI wanted to play something nice for Vanessa,\u201d he says. They\u2019d been fighting again. Vanessa filed divorce papers in 2011. Kobe was desperate to hold on to her. He wanted a grand gesture. \u201cSitting down and taking lessons would be too easy,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I taught myself by ear.\u201d It was harder than he thought. His fingers have been broken and jammed so many times over the years that they don\u2019t really bend anymore. Taking lessons would be easier, yes. They\u2019d also be a way of learning to read sheet music so he could play other songs besides \u201cMoonlight Sonata.\u201d But Kobe had to teach himself how to play to prove his love to Vanessa and reinforce his own sense of exceptionalism. \u201cThat\u2019s the song I wanted to learn,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much beauty and agony. If you watch Muse, we use the chords from \u2018Moonlight Sonata.'\u201d", "lang": "en"}
