After Black Lives Matter protests swept the nation in the spring of 2020, Kroger did announce that through its charitable foundation, it would create a $5 million fund \u201cto improve social diversity, equity and inclusion.\u201d\n\nThe image in question purportedly showed a Kroger receipt itemizing a carton of milk for $2.39 and a \u201cBLM CHARGE\u201d (circled in red in the photo above) of 59 cents.\n\nBut Kroger isn\u2019t adding a fee to customer transactions in order to raise money for Black Lives Matter. A spokesperson for the company confirmed the image was altered from an actual receipt showing 59 cents charged for a \u201cchange shortage.\u201d\n\nAs we previously reported, that 59-cent charge was added as the result of a confusing company policy regarding returning coin change amid a national coin shortage. A statement from Kroger states, \u201cThe Federal Reserve is experiencing a significant coin shortage across the U.S., resulting from fewer coins being exchanged and spent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Like many retailers and businesses, we are adjusting to the temporary shortage in several ways while still accepting cash.\u201d\n\nAs we noted, store policy on how customers receive coin change has been a point of confusion. A customer in Illinois reported that a cashier refused to return change in coin form, charging them $3 for an item that cost $2.41, resulting in the 59-cent charge on the receipt.\n\nKroger spokeswoman Kristal Howard told us by email on July 24, 2020, that the policy as of this writing is that customers can use credit or debit cards, opt to have the difference loaded onto loyalty cards as credit for future purchases, provide coin change in a lane that has coins available, or round their purchase total up and donate the difference to charity.\n\nThe BLM Kroger receipt hoax appears to be a classic case of \u201cFauxtography,\u201d an altered photograph meant to spread misinformation. We therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
