Furthermore, the video has also overlaid the audio of former Congress President Rahul Gandhi's speech from a rally in Gujarat in 2017.\n\nBOOM debunked the same doctored video ahead of the assembly elections in Gujarat in December 2017.\n\nAlso Read: Video Of Paid Supporters During Congress Rally True But Not From Gujarat\n\nThe caption accompanying the post claims, \"all women are getting an amount for 'azaadi' in their hands via Congress workers.\"\n\nSlogans of 'Azaadi' have become a popular chant in rallies opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).\n\n\n\nA Facebook user named Alok Shukla had shared the clip and in less than twelve hours of time, the video garnered over 24,000 shares and over 2,96,000 views. The video is doing the rounds on Twitter also.\n\nYou can access the archived version here.\n\nWe found the same video on YouTube in March 2017. In the original video, one can hear Meitei and not Gujarati. There is no audio of Rahul Gandhi in the YouTube clip.\n\n\n\nIn the introduction of the video above, uploaded on March 2, 2017. The title of the video says 'Congress Bribing Voters In Imphal, Manipur? VIDEO GOES VIRAL !'\n\nIn the viral video we noticed a placard that says 'Ward 5 KMC'. We had found that KMC stands for Kakching Municipal Council. Legislative assembly elections were held in Manipur between March 4th, 2017 and March 8th, 2017.\n\nThe audio of Rahul Gandhi's speech in Gujarat was taken from a different rally in the same year. A video of the Navsarjan Gujarat Janadesh rally can be seen below.\n\nAt the time stamp of 2.28 seconds, the same audio can be heard as in the viral video.", "lang": "en"}
