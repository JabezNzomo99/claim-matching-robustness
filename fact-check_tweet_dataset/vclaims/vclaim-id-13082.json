R. 1404), which passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on March 12, and other issues related to U.S. efforts to counter corruption in Russia.\n\nThat bill seeks to \u201cstrengthen the United States response to Russian interference by providing transparency on the corruption of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\nThis prompted Solovyov to turn his attention to graft in the United States, asking how many high-ranking American officials would \u201csuffer\u201d if the U.S. \u201csuddenly begins to actually start fighting corruption.\u201d\n\nCohen, who also is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Counicil, replied that he supports fighting corruption everywhere. He added that Russia\u2019s law enforcement practices and institutions are not yet considered transparent enough by the world community to take part in broader transparency efforts.\n\n\u201cWe know about telephone justice. We know about judges getting their verdicts dictated. We know about the politicization of legal actions,\u201d Cohen said, adding that that was why the U.S. only cooperated with certain states on anti-graft measures.\n\nRegarding telephone justice \u2013 the practice of powerful individuals calling judges to instruct them on what verdicts to deliver \u2013 Solovyov claimed \u201cit used to be like that\u201d in Russia, adding the present situation needed to be assessed in detail.\n\n\u201c\u2026 If we study the percentage of verdicts and serious cases, we\u2019ll discover that it\u2019s not an accident that Russia has the lowest prison population in the entire history of our state, 400,000 people or something like that. America has the highest, by the way.\u201d\n\nWhat to make of this?\n\nFirst, Solovyov\u2019s claim that Russia\u2019s falling incarceration rate demonstrates that telephone justice has gone by the wayside is unsubstantiated. A 2014 U.N. Human Rights Council Report on the challenges to the independence and impartiality of the Russian judiciary stated the following:\n\n\u201cThe worrisome perception that judges already know what they are going to decide before proceedings are completed is reinforced by the frequent lack of justification for verdicts rendered, including decisions on pretrial detention.\u201d\n\nThat perception is reinforced by the fact that Russia\u2019s acquittal rate in 2017 was only .34 percent in 2017. While the degree and scope of telephone justice remains unclear, a falling incarceration rate in itself does not demonstrate the impartiality with which verdicts have been reached.\n\nAs for Solovyov\u2019s claims regarding Russia\u2019s record low number of prisoners versus the United States\u2019 world-leading incarceration level, on a strictly quantitative level, that appears to be correct.\n\nAccording to the Estonia-based news portal Meduza and other Russian media outlets, Russia\u2019s Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) reported in December 2018 that 467,724 people were incarcerated in the country (compared with 588,000 people in January 2013 and 497,000 in January 2018) \u2013 apparently the lowest level in the history of the modern Russian state.\n\nLate last year, 14,000 people were released due to a change in the way Russia calculates days spent in pre-trial detention, with 100,000 more facing early parole.\n\nThe FSIN reported that as of March 1, 455,514 people were serving their sentences in correctional colonies in Russia and 100,771 people were being held in pre-trial detention.\n\nIncluding the Crimean peninsula, Russia\u2019s official population is 146,781,000. Based on the FSIN\u2019s latest data, Russia roughly incarcerates 310 people per 100,000 residents of all ages.\n\nWhat about the United States?\n\nWhile the U.S. Department of Justice released a study in 2016 saying the incarceration rate was at its lowest rate since 1996, at that time the government said there were still 2,162,400 people behind bars.\n\nWith 670 people per 100,000 in prison or local jail for that year (the Statista portal put the figure at 655 prisoners per 100,000 in July 2018), the U.S. is estimated to have both the highest per capita incarceration rate and the largest prison population in the world. There is considerable debate in the U.S. on the reasons for this stark number and proposals for change in the criminal justice system.\n\nWe find that judging by the numbers alone does not paint a complete picture of a criminal justice system. The right to due process, the likelihood of experiencing human rights violations (as well as the severity of related acts) and determining how many people are actually incarcerated are drastically complicated in nations that are less transparent.\n\nChina and North Korea come to mind, in terms of lacking overall transparency in their prison populations. Russia\u2019s problematic record in its criminal justice system, including illegal detention and sporadic killing of gay men in Chechnya, unexplained disappearances in the North Caucuses and \u201claw enforcement personnel engaged in torture, abuse, and violence to coerce confessions from suspects\u201d raise troubling questions that are not the focus of this fact check.\n\nBut on purely quantitative basis, Solovyov\u2019s claims regarding Russia\u2019s falling incarceration rate and the United States disproportionately high incarceration rates are true, although the connection between that and the existence of telephone justice is not established.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Solovyov\u2019s overall claim to be unclear.", "lang": "en"}
