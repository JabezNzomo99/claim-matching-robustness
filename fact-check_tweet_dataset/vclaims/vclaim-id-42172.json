No such law existed in the first place.\n\nPopular posts on Facebook put a new twist on the long-circulating falsehood that Muslims are banned from holding public office.\n\nLate last year, we debunked the erroneous and viral claim that the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act \u201cbans Muslims from holding public office in the United States.\u201d And before that, we made clear that there was no Supreme Court ruling upholding a law that \u201cdisallowed Muslims from participating in American government,\u201d despite what a hoax story said. \n\n\n\nNow, posts circulating on Facebook are claiming that the 1952 law was actually \u201cQUIETLY repealed\u201d in 1990 \u2014 and that\u2019s \u201cwhy Muslims can run for office.\u201d\n\nThe McCarran-Walter Act, formally known as the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, largely codified the country\u2019s immigration policies, as we\u2019ve written before. It upheld aspects such as the national-origins quota system established in 1924, but it also officially ended the exclusion of Asian immigrants.\n\nNo part of that law, or any law, has barred Muslims from serving in public office.\n\nSuch a policy would defy the U.S. Constitution. Article VI stipulates that \u201cno religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\u201d It would also run counter to the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of religion.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
