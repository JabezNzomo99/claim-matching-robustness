This income is known as your personal allowance.\n\nUnder the Coalition government the personal allowance went up from \u00a36,475 to \u00a310,600. In total, these changes meant that 4 million people in the UK no longer had to pay income tax and 28 million people saw their tax bill reduced, according to the Treasury.\n\nIn 2015 the Conservative government increased the personal allowance again, which was to increase from \u00a310,600 to \u00a311,000 in 2016/17.\n\nOn 6th April 2017 the personal allowance went up to \u00a311,500. Together these increases are expected to take another 1.3 million people out of paying any income tax, and to cut income tax for 31 million people in 2017/18.", "lang": "en"}
