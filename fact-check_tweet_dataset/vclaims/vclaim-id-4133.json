Relying on an interview with a coast guard official in Colombia, the Nation reported that authorities in that country had found 40 packages of cocaine, or about 90 pounds, aboard the Ping May, a bulk carrier owned by Foremost Group. The ship was docked at the Colombian port city of Santa Marta and destined for the Netherlands with a shipment of coal, the magazine reported.\n\nThe Fact Checker found an August 2014 news release from the Colombian navy that corroborated much of the Nation\u2019s reporting. According to the navy, the Ping May had arrived from the United Kingdom in mid-August 2014 and was departing for Rotterdam with its coal shipment later that month when Colombian authorities discovered the 40 packages of cocaine. \u201cNo persons were captured in the operation,\u201d the Colombian navy said.\n\nSecond, there is no evidence that McConnell\u2019s father-in-law has \u201cgiven Mitch and his wife millions of dollars over the years.\u201d Elaine Chao received an inheritance valued at between $5 million and $25 million after her mother\u2019s death in 2007. This was years before the drug bust in Santa Marta in 2014. There is no record of McConnell receiving any other financial windfall from his in-laws.\n\nBlankenship\u2019s news release cites a book about McConnell and other politicians called \u201cSecret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,\u201d by Peter Schweizer. In an interview with Breitbart News, Schweizer refers to this same $5 million to $25 million, and nothing else, as an example of the money McConnell has received from his father-in-law. \u201cMcConnell himself has benefited because a few years ago, James Chao gave Mitch McConnell a gift between five and twenty-five million dollars that more than quadrupled his net worth overnight,\u201d Schweizer told Breitbart. Notice how he describes Elaine Chao\u2019s inheritance as a \u201cgift\u201d from her father to McConnell.\n\nAssuming a street price of $150,000 per kilogram for the 40 packages of cocaine on the Ping May gets you to only $6 million, though, so it\u2019s unclear how the Blankenship campaign arrived at $7 million. Perhaps it assumed that diluting the cocaine with cornstarch, caffeine or other additives would yield another $1 million. In any case, prices are lower in Europe, where these drugs were actually headed.\n\nHe said, \u201cForty kilos in a big ship with containers and stuff like that is not a significant amount, and in order to be able to ascribe responsibility to a person in such a large ship,\u201d authorities would need to establish a clear nexus. Had the 40 kilos been found inside a shipping container, perhaps the company that owned the cargo inside might be held responsible. (The Ping May is a bulk carrier, though, so there were no containers.)\n\nIn short, just because Colombian officials found cocaine on the Ping May doesn\u2019t mean Foremost Group was shipping it or planning to profit from its sale. Who hid the drugs in the ship\u2019s chain locker? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess, but it\u2019s important to remember that Colombian authorities do not appear to have charged the ship\u2019s captain or crew. They didn\u2019t charge Foremost Group or the Chaos. They certainly didn\u2019t charge McConnell.", "lang": "en"}
