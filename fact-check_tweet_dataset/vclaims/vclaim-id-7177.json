They haven\u2019t disclosed a motive.\n\nSince the shooting on May 18, there has been no evidence to indicate that the alleged shooter, 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, was connected to the loosely organized group of anti-fascist activists called Antifa.\n\nBut a video from Mike Cernovich \u2014 who is best known for spreading the bogus \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory \u2014 has spawned several headlines on Facebook like these: \u201cSanta Fe high school shooter has Antifa hammer and sickle, Iron Cross, Satanic Star pins on trench coat\u201d and \u201cSanta Fe School Shooter\u2019s ANTIFA Connections Discovered!\u201d\n\nIn his hour-long video, Cernovich says at one point, \u201cI didn\u2019t say Antifa did it. I\u2019m just simply observing that the shooter was wearing a symbol of Antifa,\u201d the post is titled: \u201cTexas Shooter Wore ANTIFA Hammer-and-Sickle Gang Logo.\u201d\n\nBut, to the extent that it has a logo at all, Antifa usually uses a graphic of two single-color flags, one red and one black. The hammer and sickle is a communist symbol associated with the former the Soviet Union.\n\nA pin featuring a hammer and sickle did sit on the collar of a trench coat pictured on a now-deleted Facebook page that had belonged to Pagourtzis. It was the same style pin that Columbine High School shooter Dylan Klebold wore on his combat boot when he and Eric Harris gunned down 13 students and staff in 1999.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said nothing about the pin when asked during a press conference on the day of the shooting if there had been any warning signs that Pagourtzis may have been dangerous. Abbott said the only sign was a picture on the deleted Facebook page of a T-shirt that said \u201cborn to kill.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Cernovich, a right-wing personality, has tried to tie Antifa to mass shooters soon after a tragedy. On the same day that 26 people died in a church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Cernovich tweeted without any evidence: \u201cThis is looking more and more like Antifa terror.\u201d We wrote about that claim, too.\n\nOthers on the Internet were also quick to put up false information about Pagourtzis in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Within hours of the shooting, a fake Facebook page featured a picture of Pagourtzis with an image of a Hillary Clinton campaign hat superimposed on his head and an Antifa banner across the top of the page went up. The page since has been taken down.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cSanta Fe high school shooter has Antifa hammer and sickle, Iron Cross, Satanic Star pins on trench coat\u201d PuppetStringNews.com. 18 May 2018.\n\nAnti-Defamation League. \u201cWho are the Antifa?\u201d Accessed 21 May 2018.\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation. \u201cActive Shooter Incidents in the United States in 2016 and 2017.\u201d Accessed 21 May 2018.", "lang": "en"}
