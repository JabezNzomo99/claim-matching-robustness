No, that's not true: the story was mde up by a Canadian website that invents tales of bizarre crimes and weird sex acts for entertainment purposes. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on October 20, 2018 titled \"Chemotherapy patient beaten up by Antifa mob after being mistaken for Neo-Nazi skinhead\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA 37-year-old chemotherapy patient was savagely beaten by what he describes as an \"Antifa mob\" as he was escorted by his 74-year-old mother in a wheelchair out of the hospital. Derrick Johnson, 37, who has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer had just undergone his third session of chemotherapy at the Providence Cancer Center in East Portland when the attack occurred. Only moments after exiting the hospital, he and his mother were separated by a mob of protesters dressed in black as he was thrown off of his wheelchair and onto the street asphalt.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, leading many to think it was real:\n\nHowever the image of the cancer patient seems to be taken from a 2010 blog posts where somebody describes their experience with high dose chemo:\n\nsome images taken during the high dose chemo that I've been meaning to post but haven't previously. my legs a few days after the initial kidney failure and the blisters formed. They were still 'wheeping' I think they called it, at this point but they were all popped by this time.\n\nAnd the image of the beatdown seems to come from a riot video taken during a protest:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Canadians Do NOT Face Donut Shortage After First Day Of Cannabis Legalization\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman NOT Arrested For Trying Out Dozens of Sex Toys In Walmart Store\n\u2022 Fake News: Pro-Choice Activist Did NOT Break World Record By Getting 27th Abortion\n\u2022 Fake News: Daughter NOT Kicked Out of Home After She Refused To Wash Hair For Six Years\n\u2022 Fake News: Obese Couple Did NOT Make Three-Story Fall After Floor Collapses During Sex", "lang": "en"}
