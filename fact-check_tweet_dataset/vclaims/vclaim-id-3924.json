Incidentally I don\u2019t take any credit for that, I was Home Secretary during the height of the crisis\u2026 if your economy is so bad and if you\u2019re in bad times you\u2019re not going to want to come and work here.\u201d\n\nThese figures aren\u2019t correct, but it is correct to say that net migration is currently the highest estimate on record.\n\nNet migration\u2014the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and moving abroad\u2014was 336,000 in the latest set of figures, which cover the year to June 2015.\n\nThat matches the level for the year to March 2015, which is the highest level that\u2019s ever been recorded since comparable records began in 1991. Years prior to that indicate lower levels as well.\n\nWorking out levels of migration is rather tricky, so there\u2019s always considerable uncertainty in these estimates. The real level of net migration over recent years could be around 40,000 more or less than the estimated level.\n\nAlan Johnson was Home Secretary from June 2009 to May 2010. The closest set of figures we have to that period are the year to June 2010, when net migration is now thought to have been around 244,000. So that\u2019s a fair bit higher than the 160,000 he referred to.\n\nThe figures have been revised for that period, so it\u2019s possible Mr Johnson was referring to the previous set of estimates. In the year to June 2009, it was previously estimated that net migration was 166,000, rising to 235,000 in the year to June 2010.\n\nThe wider topic of the interview was immigration to and from the EU. EU net migration was 180,000 in the latest set of statistics, and 72,000 in the year to June 2010.\n\nMr Johnson went on to say that he didn\u2019t think restricting benefits to EU migrants would reduce immigration. We\u2019ve covered whether it would in a previous factcheck.", "lang": "en"}
