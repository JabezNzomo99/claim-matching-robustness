Growth in Japan, China and Europe has been slowing.\n\nBut several trends for which Mr. Trump took credit were underway \u2014 and in some cases more pronounced \u2014 before he took office. Other claims lacked context or foundation.\n\nHere are some of the president\u2019s remarks during the White House session, fact-checked:\n\nIt does look as if the growth rate has picked up meaningfully this year and may be on track for the best year of the decade-long recovery. But the economy is continuing the essentially upward trajectory established before Mr. Trump took office, with some quarters growing a little faster and some more slowly. In a given quarter, the economy exceeded 4 percent annual growth four times during the Obama administration, with the highest level \u2014 5.3 percent \u2014 occurring in the third quarter of 2014. The jobless rate was 7.8 percent when President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, and was 4.8 percent when he turned over the reins to Mr. Trump. In Mr. Trump\u2019s 18 months in office, the jobless rate has fallen further, and was 4 percent last month. Gross domestic product has risen every year for the past nine years.", "lang": "en"}
