Sherrod Brown took the stage on the final day of the convention in Philadelphia.\n\nBrown, who insisted all along that his gig representing Ohio is satisfying enough, delivered a speech that drew contrasts between nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\n\"While Trump outsources jobs, Hillary Clinton has a real plan to bring jobs back to America \u2013 like a $10 billion \u2018Made in America\u2019 plan with tax credits to revitalize manufacturing,\" Brown said. \"Trump proposes tax cuts, too \u2013 $3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his. Of course we can\u2019t say for sure how much Trump will take for himself, because he\u2019s refused to share his tax returns with the American People.\"\n\nIt\u2019s been widely reported that Trump\u2019s tax plan generously favors the top one-percent of Americans. We asked Brown\u2019s Senate office for his sources of the numbers \"$3 trillion\" and \"$2 trillion.\" Trillions tend to sound exaggerated -- maybe because that many zeroes make our eyeballs swim.\n\nRachel Petri, from Brown\u2019s senate office, offered a piece from Citizens for Tax Justice to back up the claim about Trump\u2019s planned corporate tax cuts.\n\nCitizens for Tax Justice, a liberal think tank, plotted a hypothetical analysis of Trump\u2019s proposal, if implemented in 2016. They found that the changes would equal $12 trillion less revenue collected in federal taxes over the next decade.\n\n\"This includes $9.6 trillion in personal income tax cuts, $2 trillion in corporate income tax cuts, and the $300 billion cost of repealing estate and gift taxes,\" according to the report (emphasis ours).\n\nPetri said that the $3 trillion for millionaires figure comes from data from the Tax Policy Center, which was analyzed by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That report estimates that the tax cuts going to millionaires would result in a loss of revenue collected by approximately $3.2 trillion over 10 years.\n\nSince both groups Brown pulled stats from are liberal-leaning, we looked for a report from a source that skews conservative.\n\nOne such group, the Tax Foundation, reported a cost of $1.54 trillion for Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts over 10 years. Though that is off by half a trillion, rounding up would get it to Brown\u2019s $2 trillion quote.\n\nThe Tax Foundation estimates $10.2 trillion less revenue over a decade due to reduced individual tax rates. The top one-percent of earners would see 27 percent of the cut under the plan, which is about $2.75 trillion. (Correction Aug. 2, 2016: An earlier version of this fact-check had a different calculation.) Again, rounding up gets it to Brown\u2019s $3 trillion under this analysis.\n\nTrump is no longer the presumptive Republican candidate, but this is a presumptive tax plan. In May, Trump tapped two all-stars of conservative fiscal policy to help with a revamp. As of yet, Trump Tax 2.0 is still pending.\n\nAddressing the DNC, Brown said that Trump\u2019s tax plan would cut \"$3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his.\"\n\nThose numbers basically check out, via Brown\u2019s think-tank sources. A conservative group\u2019s analysis fell a little shorter, but supports Brown when rounded up.\n\nIt\u2019s all subject to change upon the unveiling of Trump\u2019s Tax Plan Part Two. But it is accurate as of Brown\u2019s speech.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
