However, the photo actually shows Mina, a neighbourhood in Mecca in Saudi Arabia, during the annual Islamic pilgrimage of Haj.\n\nThe image has been posted widely across social media, including here on Facebook where it has been shared more than 2,600 times since it was published January 11, 2018.\n\nThe photograph shows tents spread over a massive area with glittering street lights, and claims that it is part of the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, a city formerly known as Allahabad in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post.\n\n\n\nThe misleading post has a caption in Hindi language that translates as: \u201cThe incredible view of Kumbh is for the first time since independence! And then you ask, what did Modi and Yogi do for Hindus?\u201d\n\nModi refers to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Yogi is Yogi Adityanath, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Both belong to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nThe Kumbh Mela runs from 15 January to March 4, 2019.\n\nThe text in the photo states: \u201cThe city of Prayagraj is glittering like gold, see for yourself fellow country men, this the the rule of BJP.\u201d\n\nThe photo was posted multiple times on Facebook and Twitter with similar claims, for example here and here.\n\nLocal media and news websites shared the photo and incorrectly stated it was Prayagraj.\n\nHowever, a reverse image search of the photo found the image had previously been widely posted online, often titled \u2018night view of Mina.\u2019\n\nMina is a neighborhood of Mecca in Makkah Province, in western Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe earliest version of the image AFP was able to track down is the one below, posted on Instagram on August 19, 2018 by a user \u2018Haramain.info2\u2019. The location of the photograph was given as Mecca.\n\nA similar image taken from a different angle appears on Google Earth in Mina at a location known as \u2018Mina Towers in Mecca.\u2019\n\nThe exact location in Mina was verified by AFP using instant street view from a lower vantage point during the daytime.\n\nBelow is the screengrab of the street view image alongside the image used in misleading post, where the same conical tents can be seen.\n\nFive distinctive features, marked as A, B, C, D and E in both screenshots, depicts the same structures.\n\n\u2018A\u2019 shows the same tin shed, while \u2018B\u2019 points out to the cellular network tower. Identification \u2018C\u2019 is the structure of an entrance. Mark \u2018D\u2019 is the road signage and \u2018E\u2019 is the curve of the road.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a different view of the tents in Mina captured by an AFP photographer on August 22, 2018.\n\nHere is an AFP photo taken at Prayagraj on January 9, 2019, one week before the commencement of the Kumbh Mela. The tents in the photos below are not conical in shape, and many tents are multicolored, unlike those in Mina which are entirely white.", "lang": "en"}
