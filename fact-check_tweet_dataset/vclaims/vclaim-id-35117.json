The post has been shared tens of thousands of times. But according to multiple sources, Islam is second to Christianity in estimates of world religions with the most followers.\n\nThe Facebook post was published here on October 6, 2019.\n\nIt contains a cartoon which shows Muslims praying. The accompanying Malaysian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cDo you know? Today, Islam is the number one religion with the most devotees in the world. God is the greatest!\u201d\n\nThe post has been shared more than 35,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post is misleading. In fact, Christianity has the most followers of all the world\u2019s religions, according to multiple government and scholarly sources.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which publishes global and national demographic statistics, listed Christianity as the largest religion in the world in 2018. On its website here, it stated 31.4 percent of the world\u2019s population were Christians, and 23.2 percent were Muslims.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the CIA data with the statistic highlighted in red by AFP:\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF), a major international development non-profit based in Geneva, also noted in a report in March 2019 that Christianity remains the world\u2019s largest religion by population. Citing estimates from the World Religion Database, the WEF reported here that 32.8 percent of the world\u2019s population is Christian while 22.5 percent is Muslim.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the WEF\u2019s report, which analyses religious affiliations by country:\n\nThe Pew Research Center also found here that Christianity remains the world\u2019s largest religion. The US-based think tank reported that in 2015, 31.2 percent of the world\u2019s population or 2.3 billion worldwide were Christian, while 24.1 percent or 1.8 billion people were Muslim.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Pew\u2019s figures:\n\nPew, however, noted that while Christianity remains the world\u2019s largest religion, Islam is the world\u2019s fastest growing faith.\n\nPew\u2019s report reads: \u201cThis large natural increase results from both high Muslim fertility and the concentration of the Muslim population in younger age groups, which have lower mortality rates.\u201d\n\nThe organisation projected here that Islam will overtake Christianity as the world\u2019s largest religion by population in 2070. Pew stresses, however, that the prediction is based on the continuation of birth rates, death rates and religious affiliation trends, all of which are subject to change in the coming decades.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Pew\u2019s projection:", "lang": "en"}
