The post further claims that the Maulvi of the mosque was arrested by UP police. The collage in one picture shows guns displayed on a sofa and the other from a press conference. BOOM found that the picture of guns on the sofa is from a Tumblr post and the other photo is from a 2016 press conference by Rajkot police, Gujarat following a raid at a hotel running an illegal arms racket. BOOM had earlier debunked the same photo when it was viral as weapons seized from a mosque in Gujarat.", "lang": "en"}
