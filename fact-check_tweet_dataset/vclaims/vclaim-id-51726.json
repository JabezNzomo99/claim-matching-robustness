The photo is almost four years old, taken in August 2016, in Srinagar.\n\nA Facebook page Awantipora news posted this image with a caption \u201cStone Pelting Starts at Kreeri After Killing of 3 Militants.\u201d Some other Facebook users also shared the misleading post. Archive of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe viral photo shows a signature of one \u2018Muzamil Matto\u2019 and suggests that the photo was clicked in 2016. We found that Muzamil Mattoo is a freelance photojournalist in Kashmir who clicked this picture in August 2016 in Srinagar.\n\nMuzamil Mattoo uploaded this picture on his Instagram profile on August 31, 2016. He captioned the image as \u201cProtestors clash with Indian forces during pro-freedom demonstrations in Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir.\u201d\n\nIndia Today also reached out to Mattoo regarding the viral photo. Mattoo confirmed to us that he had clicked the picture in Batamaloo locality of Srinagar.\n\nThe photo is also available on stock photo website Alamy.\n\nIt proves that the photo was taken in 2016 and has nothing to do with the recent clashes in Baramulla. As of now, no major incident of stone-pelting has been reported from the valley after the encounter of three militants. However, India Today J&K correspondent Ashraf Wani did confirm that one or two minor incidents of stone-pelting took place in Kreeri after the encounter in Baramulla on Monday.", "lang": "en"}
