This is false; the original video was of an interview with veteran singer and actor Harry Belafonte almost nine years ago, during which he appeared to doze off. The footage was doctored to show Biden sitting in Belafonte\u2019s place.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden was sleeping during a TV live interview,\u201d reads the caption of a video shared on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other platforms on August 30, 2020.\n\nThe video shows a news anchor attempting to introduce the interviewee \u201clive from New York,\u201d only to realize that the subject, Joe Biden, has his eyes closed and is snoring. Despite insisting, \u201cWake up, Wake up,\u201d Biden remains asleep and snoring, causing laughter in the newsroom.\n\nThe bottom of the screen reads \u201cJoe Biden: The Importance of This Election.\u201d\n\nHowever, the video is a montage. The Democratic Party\u2019s nominee did not fall asleep on live TV.\n\nTwitter users pointed to the original footage of journalist Leyla Santiago from October 2011, when TV station KBAK from Bakersfield, California attempted to interview Belafonte, who was in New York City.\n\nThen aged 84, Belafonte seemed to have fallen asleep before talking to the morning show \u201cEyewitness News,\u201d although the singer blamed a lost connection that made him unable to hear the host talking to him.\n\n\u201cThey keep stooping lower and lower,\u201d Belafonte said of the manipulated video in a statement to Deadline.\n\n\u201cA technical glitch in an interview I did nine years ago now becomes another one of their lies, more of their fake news.\u201d\n\nJohn Dabkovich, a CBS journalist who was co-anchor in the studio that day, labeled the video as \u201cfake\u201d on Twitter after White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications Dan Scavino shared it on the platform on August 30, 2020.\n\nThe video of Biden with his eyes seemingly closed is from an endorsement of the nominee by former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Biden lowers his eyes several times throughout the video, making it seem possible that they were closed at some point.\n\nSeveral visual clues confirm this. In both videos, Biden is wearing a red tie, a US flag pin, and has three small white triangles sewn in his suit pocket. The same white shelves appear in the background of both videos, as well as a football and two picture frames.\n\nThe snoring noises, as well as the banner at the bottom of the screen, appear to have been fabricated entirely.\n\nQuestions were, however, raised in 2011 about whether Biden was sleeping during former president Barack Obama\u2019s budget speech.\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump, trailing his opponent in polls, has sought to portray the Democratic candidate as senile, calling him \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d though the two men are only three years apart in age.\n\nThe Biden campaign has yet to respond to an AFP request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
