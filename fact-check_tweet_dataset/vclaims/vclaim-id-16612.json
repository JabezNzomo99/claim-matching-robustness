Both leaders\u2019 claims were correct.\n\nMrs May said the UK-US trading relationship was worth over \u00a3190 billion per year. That\u2019s correct if you look at the value of what each country exports to the other.\n\nUK exports in goods and services to the US were worth around \u00a3118 billion in 2018 with US exports to the UK (or what we import) worth just over \u00a372 billion. In total that\u2019s trade worth around \u00a3191 billion to both the UK and the United States.\n\nYou could also express that in terms of the UK\u2019s balance of trade (exports minus imports) which was worth just under \u00a346 billion.\n\nMr Trump also said that the UK was the USA\u2019s largest European export market. That\u2019s correct. In 2018 exports to the UK made up almost 6% of all US exports, putting it behind Canada, Mexico and China, but ahead of all other countries the US exports to (including those in Europe).\n\nBoth Mrs May and Mr Trump claimed that over $1 trillion was mutually invested in the two countries. The Prime Minister\u2019s office told us this was based on US figures from the Bureau for Economic Affairs (BEA).\n\nThese show that the UK-based companies invested around $541 billion in the USA in 2017 while US-based companies invested around $748 billion in the UK. That totals around $1.3 trillion (which is slightly over \u00a31 trillion).\n\nMr Trump also claimed that the UK is America\u2019s largest foreign investor. That\u2019s correct, according to the BEA figures. The $541 billion the UK invested in 2017 put it top for investment in the US ahead of Japan, Canada, Luxembourg and the Netherlands that year.\n\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the UK are slightly different and put UK-based companies\u2019 investment at around \u00a3258 billion in 2017 (or $330 billion based on that year\u2019s exchange rate).\n\nMrs May expanded on this by claiming that the US was also the largest investor in the UK. That\u2019s also correct, US-based companies invested around \u00a3351 billion in the UK ($450 billion). That makes it the top investor ahead of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Japan and Germany.\n\nThe ONS told us that it\u2019s unclear exactly why their figures and those from the US differ so much, and say they\u2019re undertaking work to find out more about this. We\u2019ve run into this issue with trade figures before and written more about it here.", "lang": "en"}
