A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office confirmed the letter is fake.\n\nThe letter, which appears to bear the official U.K. government letterhead and Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s signature, informs recipients of a proposed policy that would require all residents to receive a radio frequency identification (RFID) microchip starting in 2021. Such implants would be provided and inserted for free through the National Health Service (NHS), according to the letter.\n\n\u201cIn a world where we face issues of terrorism, crime and cyber fraud, the RFID microchips will enable law enforcement agencies to track the movements of criminals and terrorists,\u201d the alleged letter continues. \u201cIt will also hold a unique personal identification number, that once scanned, will allow law enforcement to identify whether that person is: wanted for a crime, an illegal immigrant or a terrorist sympathiser etc.\u201d\n\nBut the Daily Caller found no evidence of the letter or such a proposal existing. Had Johnson sent the letter, media outlets would have reported on it, yet none have. A press conference and a speech were uploaded to the U.K. government website on June 9, the same day the alleged letter was dated, but neither of them mention RFID microchips. A search of the NHS website also yielded no results regarding implantation of microchips.\n\nA closer inspection of the letter revealed a discrepancy that further adds to its dubiousness. On the alleged letter, only the initial for Johnson\u2019s first name appears in the signature, whereas Johnson has signed his whole first name on other official documents.
