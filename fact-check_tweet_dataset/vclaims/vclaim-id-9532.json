Yellow is a color associated with the Liberal Party, red with communist groups.\n\nDuterte\u2019s claim that communists and the Liberal Party \u201cshare the same\u201d ideology does not hold water when one considers recent political history.\n\nPeace negotiations between communist insurgents and the Philippine government under former president Benigno S. Aquino III, Duterte\u2019s predecessor and a Liberal Party stalwart, stalled because of, among others, ideological differences.\n\nIn a statement released May 28 last year, Luis Jalandoni, chair of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), the political arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), accused the Aquino administration of walking out of the peace talks.\n\nThe statement, posted on the NDFP website, read:\n\nPadilla was chair of the government\u2019s negotiating panel at the time.\n\nCPP founding chair Jose Maria Sison also censured Aquino, and in a video also posted on the NDFP website said:\n\nIn contrast, Duterte, upon winning the presidency, offered the CPP four cabinet posts, and welcomed Sison\u2019s planned return to the Philippines from his exile in The Netherlands. Duterte is Sison\u2019s former student at Lyceum of the Philippines.\n\nThe Duterte administration also revived peace negotiations with communist insurgents, and in his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) July 26 last year announced a unilateral ceasefire with the New People\u2019s Army (NPA), the armed wing of the CPP.\n\nThe Philippine government and the NDFP reached a fourth round of formal talks in April 2017 before things turned sour when the government canceled the next round of talks, citing a CPP directive to intensify attacks following Duterte\u2019s declaration of martial law in Mindanao. (See VERA FILES SONA PROMISE TRACKER: Peace process)\n\nBy his second SONA July 24, Duterte was already hostile to Sison, calling the CPP founder old and sick, before saying the talks were going nowhere. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Peace or war?)\n\nThe president labeling his critics \u201ccommunists\u201d would also appear absurd when considered alongside recent moves by his political party.\n\nPDP Laban, chaired by Duterte, in an Oct. 18 press release announced it had inked a \u201chistoric accord\u201d with United Russia, the ruling party of the Russian Federation, to \u201cboost diplomatic ties through relations with ruling parties of other countries.\u201d\n\nRussia is formerly communist, but more important, the press release noted that the accord is the second memorandum with a foreign political party signed by PDP Laban.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first one (was) the Memorandum of Agreement between PDP Laban and the Communist Party of China, signed in February of this year,\u201d it added.\n\nDuterte in several speeches has claimed he is a \"leftist\" and a \"socialist\" but not a member of the CPP.\n\n\n\nIn a speech April 5, he said:\n\nDuterte\u2019s blanket claim recalls the 1971 Plaza Miranda bombing, a violent episode in Philippine political history that involves the Liberal Party and allegedly the CPP:\n\nThe bombing, among the events that ostensibly triggered the declaration of martial law by Ferdinand Marcos, was initially thought to be the doing of the late strongman.\n\nYet, a 1989 report by journalist Gregg Jones published in The Washington Post pinned the blame on the CPP:\n\nSison to date denies the accusation, and in a 2016 interview said Jones had been commissioned by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to write and \u201cblame the Plaza Miranda incident on me in order to discredit the Communist Party of the Philippines and the revolutionary movement.\u201d\n\nSison in the same interview also denied the charge that former senator Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr. was among the founders of the CPP, and that he and Sison plotted the Plaza Miranda bombing together.\n\nAquino, a Liberal Party member and the leading opposition figure during the Marcos years, was not in Plaza Miranda during the bombing.\n\n\u201cNinoy Aquino could not have been a communist or founder of the CPP. He was well known as a CIA asset from the time he was a war correspondent in Korea,\u201d Sison said.\n\nThe CIA, in a declassified document prepared following Aquino\u2019s assassination on Aug. 21, 1983 which Marcos blamed on the CPP, noted:\n\nConflating political enemies and branding them \u201ccommunists\u201d is not a Duterte-first. Marcos had done it earlier.\n\nIn a chapter in the book Crisis in the Philippines: An analysis of the Marcos era and beyond, scholar Lela Garner Noble writes that when protests against him started escalating:\n\nPCOO, Speech of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte during the Relaunch of the Malaca\u00f1ang Press Briefing Room\n\nPCOO, Speech of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte during the 29th Annual National Convention of the Prosecutors League of the Philippines\n\nNDFP, Aquino distorts facts on peace talks with the NDFP\n\nThe Official Gazette, A history of the Philippine political protest\n\nCIA Library, Aquino's Assassination: Implications for Stability in the Philippines\n\njosemariasison.org, Joma Sison Interview on Martial Law and the Plaza Miranda Bombing\n\nCrisis in the Philippines: An analysis of the Marcos era and beyond, 1986, Princeton University Press\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
