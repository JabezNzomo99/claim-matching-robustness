The evidence is mixed.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-01-21T08:00:45Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82761", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/01/21/sanderss-suggestion-he-lost-88-race-because-he-opposed-assault-weapons-fact-checker-biography/", "vclaim": "The second part of this claim is more interesting, and much more difficult to fact-check. Sanders says this almost every time he is attacked on his gun record, that he \u201cprobably,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cquite likely,\u201d or \u201cmay well have\u201d lost the 1988 because of his anti-assault weapons stance. On at least one occasion, he\u2019s drawn a direct causation: \u201cIn 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, \u201cI went before the sportsmen of Vermont and I said, \u2018I have concerns about certain types of assault weapons that have nothing to do with hunting. \u2026 I said that before the election. Vermont sportspeople, as is their right, made their endorsement. They endorsed Peter Smith. They endorsed Paul Poirier. I lost that election by about 3.5 percentage points \u2014 a very close election. Was my failure to get that endorsement pivotal? It might have been. We don\u2019t know. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn\u2019t. All that I can say is, I told the sportspeople of Vermont what I believe before the election, and I\u2019m going to say it again. I do believe that we need to ban certain types of assault weapons.\n\nIn the last congressional campaign, Sanders said repeatedly that gun control was a local issue and avoided taking a public stand on bans. He now denies that his support of assault gun legislation represents a change in his position. \u201cI made my positions very clear to the sportsmen of Vermont, which is why I did not get the NRA\u2019s endorsement,\u201d Sanders said in an interview.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how prominent a potential ban on semiautomatic rifles was in 1988. Archived news articles leading up to and following the 1988 election don\u2019t cite the NRA\u2019s endorsement as a deciding factor in the election. Yet two years later, the Associated Press reported that Smith \u201cedged out Sanders\u201d in 1988 \u201cwith the help of a strong endorsement from the National Rifle Association.\u201d (The article is embedded below.)\n\n\u201cBernie was clearly the outsider from the NRA and the hunting clubs\u2019 [perspective],\u201d Poirier, now a Sanders supporter, told The Fact Checker. \u201cThey said, \u2018Don\u2019t vote for him. Paul Smith is our candidate. Paul Poirier is acceptable.\u2019 \u2026 [Sanders] did have the NRA, through the different associations in Vermont, actively working to make sure that nobody voted for him. That\u2019s an accurate statement [by Sanders]. I don\u2019t know why people are questioning that.\u201d\n\n[Update: During the Jan. 25, 2016, Democratic presidential town hall on CNN, Sanders modified this talking point to more accurately reflect the role of NRA\u2019s endorsements in 1988. Kudos to Sanders for the change: \u201cIn 1988, I ran [for] Vermont\u2019s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. I ran as an Independent against a Democrat and a Republican. The gun lobby said vote for either the Democrat or the Republican, don\u2019t vote for Bernie Sanders. This is 1988. Because Bernie thinks that we should not be selling military style assault weapons in the United States of America. Back in 1988. I lost that election by three percentage points. I cannot tell you that that was the only reason, but I had the gun groups working against me back then.\u201d]", "lang": "en"}
