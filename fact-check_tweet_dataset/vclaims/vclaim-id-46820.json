What the hell have done modi. Rt\u201d The video shows an image of women locked behind bars and carries an audio clip where the narrator says, \u201cYou will be shocked to see this video. Share this video widely. Narendra Modi says, educate the girl, save the girl. But see how they are mistreated here and no one\u2019s come to help. You will share this video if you are my brother. Do not delete.\u201d The clip has been shared in the backdrop of the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).\n\nAnother Twitter user @IndurChhugani shared it and wrote, \u201cLadies put in jail. They pleading and seeking YOUR help. Retweet.\u201d\n\nPHOTO DATES BACK TO AT LEAST 2015\n\nAlt News reverse-searched the image on Yandex and found that it has been available on the internet at least since 2015. It was shared by a YouTube channel Rohingya Vision on April 7, 2015. As per the channel, a Rohingya boy died due to human trafficking.\n\nWe found that Rohingya Vision regularly shares videos related to Rohingyas. The same photograph posted by several websites as well in 2015. Among them was arakanna.com which wrote an article on April 15, 2015 \u2013 \u201cRohingya refugees in Thailand complain of being raped in prison.\u201d\n\nAccording to another website islahhaber.net, \u201cHundreds of people kidnapped from the Rohingya refugee camp in Thailand were announced to be sold to organ mafia by some people. According to human rights activists, Rohingya Muslims, who escaped from the pressure of the Buddhist gangs and the Arakan government in the region, took refuge in Thailand.\u201d The report is in Arabic.\n\nBased on this, we performed a keyword search on Google and found media reports from 2015 which talked about Rohingyas who became victims of trafficking in Thailand.\n\nWhile Alt News was unable to independently verify the photograph, as per several websites it depicts Rohingyas who fled to Thailand to evade persecution in Arakan or Rakhine state of Myanmar. However, the photograph\u2019s availability since 2015 proves that it does not represent any incident related to the recently passed CAA.", "lang": "en"}
