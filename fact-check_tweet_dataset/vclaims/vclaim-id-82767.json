So I wrote a letter to the NASA space agency and asked how I could become an astronaut. And I got a letter back saying that they weren\u2019t accepting women. Now, I have to be very honest with you. I could never have qualified. But it was a dream, and I have been thrilled to see young women follow that dream and do so with such skill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had always been fascinated by exploration and space travel, maybe in part because my dad was so concerned about America lagging behind Russia. President Kennedy\u2019s vow to put men on the moon excited me, and I wrote to NASA to volunteer for astronaut training. I received a letter back informing me that they were not accepting girls in the program. It was the first time I had hit an obstacle I couldn\u2019t overcome with hard work and determination, and I was outraged. Of course, my poor eyesight and mediocre physical abilities would have disqualified me anyway, regardless of gender. Still, the blanket rejection hurt and made me more sympathetic later to anyone confronted with discrimination of any kind.\u201d\n\nBut we are in the business of sometimes going down rabbit holes, after all, so it seemed like a worthwhile challenge after many readers asked us to check it out. Besides, this story of Clinton\u2019s first experience with gender discrimination has been woven into many of her speeches and interviews for more than two decades \u2014 and she continues to tell it on the campaign trail:\n\nhad been running (in 1960/61) a private screening program for potential women astronauts that was abruptly terminated in September 1961. That fall, there were many questions raised about why the program had been ended \u2014 with many fingers in the press and on Capitol Hill pointing at NASA. In the summer of 1962 there were congressional hearings on the topic. had been running (in 1960/61) a private screening program for potential women astronauts that was abruptly terminated in September 1961. That fall, there were many questions raised about why the program had been ended \u2014 with many fingers in the press and on Capitol Hill pointing at NASA. In the summer of 1962 there were congressional hearings on the topic. Dr. Randy Lovelace had been running (in 1960/61) a private screening program for potential women astronauts that was abruptly terminated in September 1961. That fall, there were many questions raised about why the program had been ended \u2014 with many fingers in the press and on Capitol Hill pointing at NASA. In the summer of 1962 there were congressional hearings on the topic. What had actually happened in September 1961 is that Dr. Lovelace had tried to run further tests on his women astronaut aspirants at Pensacola Naval Air Station. (It should be noted that most of the women weren\u2019t completely aware the Dr. Lovelace had no official backing for this effort.) Before committing resources to these tests the U.S. Navy asked NASA if this was an official program. Surprised NASA officials said no, and the Navy refused to let Dr. Lovelace run the tests at Pensacola. In discussions between NASA Deputy Administrator Hugh Dryden and U.S. Navy officials that fall, Dryden\u2019s position was that \u201cNASA does not at this time have a requirement for such a program\u201d but that it might investigate the possibility \u201cat some time in the future.\u201d This was the official policy on women astronauts and NASA response letters to women throughout the 1960s reflect this perspective.\n\nThe \u201cMiss Kelly\u201d letter \u201cremains tantalizing,\u201d said James Oberg, retired rocket scientist and space historian who has researched Clinton\u2019s story for many years. No letter of such kind from that period had surfaced previously, Oberg said. If NASA did send such letters bluntly rejecting girls, he said, it would have disappointed and angered girls and their parents amid contentious national debate over gender restriction in the astronaut program: \u201cIt defies belief, in my view, that not a single one of them wouldn\u2019t have made its way to the New York Times\u201d at the time, rather than surfacing 50 years later to fulfill modern recollections, he said.\n\nBy 1970, NASA was much more encouraging. Marsha Ivins, then-freshman engineer at the University of Colorado, wrote: \u201cMy ambition is to become an astronaut (or whatever one would call a female astronaut), or, if that is not possible, to work somewhere in the astronaut training program. What I would like to know is if you think there will be a future for women in the space program, and if so, will Aerospace Engineering provide the best background or is there a better subject to study.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
