This means that someone who is retired but previously had a professional job may fall into both the \u201cmanagerial and professional occupations\u201d category and the \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d category, so comparisons between the groups aren\u2019t perfect.\n\nNevertheless, both higher earners and professionals are more likely to drink weekly than people with other working status or lower incomes.\n\nThe proportion of professionals drinking weekly has remained stable for a few years, with 70% drinking weekly in 2016, 69% in 2015 and 71% in 2014. The number of people earning over \u00a340,000 drinking weekly is also stable at 79% last year.\n\nPeople on higher incomes are more likely to drink five times a week (14%) than those earning under \u00a330,000. 10% of professionals drink at least five days a week, higher than the 7% of people with \u201croutine and manual occupations\u201d, but not higher than people with \u201cintermediate\u201d jobs, or not in employment.\n\nAlso, despite being more likely to drink weekly, professionals aren\u2019t significantly more likely to binge drink than other socioeconomic groups, except \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d people \u2013 who are neither in work nor looking for work, such as retired people and students.\n\n19% of professionals binged (defined as drinking more than 8 units as a man, or 6 units as a woman) on their heaviest drinking day over the previous week.\n\n22% of higher earners binged in the week before survey, significantly higher than those earning under \u00a315,000.\n\nWe\u2019re all drinking less than we used to\u2026\n\nLooking over a longer period, we\u2019re all drinking less regularly than we used to. In 2007 64% of over 16s drank weekly, which fell to 57% by 2017.\n\nThe proportion drinking five times a week also fell from 17% to 10% and the proportion binge drinking fell from 20% to 16%.\n\nIn particular the number of men under 25 bingeing has fallen significantly from 32% in 2007 to 20% a decade later.\n\nThough we are probably lying about how much we drink\n\nAll these figures come from a survey and the ONS says: \u201cIt is likely that the estimates underestimate drinking levels to some extent.\n\n\u201cSocial surveys consistently produce estimates of alcohol consumption that are lower than the levels indicated by alcohol sales data.\n\n\u201cThis is likely to be because people either consciously or unconsciously underestimate their alcohol consumption.\"", "lang": "en"}
