The claim is false; Australia\u2019s Department of Health dismissed the rumour as \u201cmisinformation\u201d, adding that patients will not receive \u201crescue packs\u201d from their doctors unless previously prescribed.\n\nThe claim has been shared more than 2,000 times after it was published by an Australia-based Facebook user here on March 22, 2020.\n\nThe post reads: \u201cThose of you with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as COPD or asthma can contact your GP for a 'Rescue Pack'. It gives you a 5 day supply of a corticosteroid (prednisolone) and a 5 day supply of an antibiotic (usually amoxicillin or doxycycline) which can be started immediately if you develop any breathing issues.\u201d\n\nThe claim circulated online as the world continued to endure the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of April 2, 2020, the virus has killed more than 40,000 people and infected more than 827,000 others worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe claim was also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook, and here, here, here and here on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Health has been made aware of misinformation on social media regarding \u2018rescue packs\u2019 that contain steroid and antibiotic tablets being made available for people with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),\u201d a department spokesperson told AFP in an email on April 1. \u201cPatients cannot receive a \u2018rescue pack\u2019 from their GP, unless previously prescribed.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cIt is imperative for people with respiratory conditions to follow the health advice and management plan of their treating physician, and for everyone to be aware of false information that is sometimes posted on social media.\u201d\n\nPeople with pre-existing medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes, are at greater risk for severe disease such as novel coronavirus, the WHO warned. The agency advised good hygiene, social distancing and other preventive measures as the novel coronavirus continues to spread globally.\n\nHealth authorities in the United Kingdom and Ireland also debunked a similar rumour after it circulated online in their countries.", "lang": "en"}
