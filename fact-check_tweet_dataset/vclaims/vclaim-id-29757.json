The claim is false; the video does not show Wong; it shows another man during a 2015 protest in Hong Kong; the part of the video that shows the attack was filmed by a Hong Kong broadcaster.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on September 6, 2019.\n\nThe clip, which shows a boy kicking an elderly man\u2019s shopping trolley loaded with cardboard boxes, has been viewed almost 160,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201c#Is Taiwan receiving rubbish like Joshua Wong?\n\n\u201c#Check out Hong Kong-Joshua Wong\u2019s bad behaviours. What kind of man bullies elderly people?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s essentially a rioter, but has been treated like a hero, a VIP, during his trip to Taiwan. All he does is destroying the moral value of Taiwan. Green governance is guaranteed to collapse!\u201d\n\n\u201cGreen governance\u201d refers to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is dubbed \u201cGreen Terror\u201d by the opposition, as reported here by AFP on December 31, 2019.\n\nThe video, as well as still images from it, were also shared hundreds of times here, here and here and here on Facebook and here on YouTube alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video does not show Wong.\n\nThe section of the footage that shows the attack was filmed by Hong Kong broadcaster i-CABLE during a protest in the city in March 2015.\n\nThe i-CABLE logo can be seen in the top left-hand corner of the video in the misleading post.\n\nA reverse image and keyword search on Google found this video published on the verified Facebook account of i-CABLE on March 9, 2015.\n\nThe video\u2019s traditional Chinese-language title translates to English as: \u201c[Comment on anti-mainland visitor sentiment] [Pro-establishment camp urges police to investigate and identify instigators behind the scenes]\u201d.\n\nIts caption translates to English in part as: \u201cAn anti-parallel trading protest caused chaos once again in Tuen Mun last Sunday. Some pro-establishment lawmakers said protesters behaved like \u2018rioters\u2019 and urged police to investigate, enforce the law, identify the instigator(s) behind the scenes and protect the tourists.\"\n\nThe beginning of the video in the misleading posts, which shows the boy kicking the trolley, corresponds with the i-CABLE footage from the zero to 12-second mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a corresponding scene in the video in the misleading post (L) and the i-CABLE footage (R):\n\nThe i-CABLE video has a voice-over which states in Cantonese that protesters shouted at mainland tourists at a bus stop, and one of them kicked the shopping trolley of a mainland Chinese man, who then appeared shocked.\n\nFrom the 17-second mark, the man identified in the clip as mainland Chinese speaks to the camera in Mandarin. He states in part:\n\n\u201cI think what he did was so wrong. He seemed to be educated but that was very unreasonable. I\u2019m not afraid. I\u2019m 80 years old, I\u2019m afraid of nothing.\n\n\u201cWe need to be reasonable. If there\u2019s anything wrong, we should be gentle with each other. Hong Kong is an international city, which should consider the welfare of Hong Kongers, mainlanders, as well as people from other countries.\n\n\u201cI have four daughters, one of them lives in Hong Kong, one in Shenzhen and two in Harbin. I will continue to come visit\u2026 My daughter lives here, so I will always come.\u201d\n\nThe i-CABLE report did not make any reference to Joshua Wong.\n\nHong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post and Hong Kong television station Now News reported here and here in March 2015 about a series of rallies in various districts against parallel traders, who buy consumer goods in bulk in Hong Kong for sale across the border on the mainland.\n\nI-CABLE published this follow-up video report on March 10, 2015, which states that three people, including two 16-year-old male secondary school students and a 21-year-old female university student, were charged following the Tuen Mun protest on March 8.\n\nAll three suspects can be seen in i-CABLE\u2019s video report. Neither of the men pictured in the video are Joshua Wong.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of a photo of Wong from his verified Facebook account (L) and stills of the two arrested boys taken from the i-CABLE news segment (C & R):\n\nA custom search between March 8 and 10, 2015, on Twitter also found no mention of a Taiwan trip in Wong\u2019s tweets.\n\nJoshua Wong has been targeted by disinformation since he emerged as a leader of Hong Kong\u2019s 2014 Umbrella Movement. Here is an AFP fact-check report about the 23-year-old activist.\n\nThe same misleading claim was previously debunked in this report published by Taiwan-based fact-check site Taiwan FactCheck Center on September 17, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
