However, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Lincoln ever said this expression, which has been attributed to him since at least 2003. (RELATED: Did Abraham Lincoln Say, \u2018It\u2019s Not The Years In Your Life That Count. It\u2019s The Life In Your Years\u2019?)\n\n\u201cI could find no evidence of Lincoln having made this comment in our database,\u201d said Daniel Worthington, director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln, in an email to the DCNF. \u201cProbably mis-attributed to him.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the DCNF searched the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library\u2019s digital archive for the words \u201cthorn bushes\u201d but turned up no results. The saying does not appear in Lincoln\u2019s collected works at the University of Michigan either.\n\nAbraham Lincoln Association Editor and Secretary James Cornelius also told the DCNF via email that he did not recognize the expression, saying, \u201cI have never heard of it in doing Lincoln research/cataloguing since 1997.\u201d\n\nThe quote may actually have originated with French journalist and author Alphonse Karr, according to the website Quote Investigator. A variation of the saying appears in his 1853 book \u201cLettres \u00c9crites De Mon Jardin,\u201d where he writes, \u201cYou complain about seeing thorny rose bushes; me, I rejoice and give thanks to the gods that thorns have roses.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
