Mike Romano offered a litany of troubling statistics about West Virginia\u2019s economy and urged the creation of \"a real economic comeback\" in West Virginia.\n\nOne of Romano\u2019s statistics was that, \"adjusting for inflation, West Virginia\u2019s median household income has not grown in a decade.\"\n\nWe fact-checked two other statements from his op-ed that turned out to be True.\n\nIs the latest one on stagnant income correct? We turned to official federal data from the Census Bureau to find out.\n\nThat data shows that in 2007, the inflation-adjusted median household income in West Virginia was $49,885 \u2014 the culmination of a decade and a half of consistent gains above the rate of inflation.\n\nBut one decade later, the 2007 figure remains the state\u2019s highest median income level since the statistic was first recorded in 1984. Over that decade, the median income fell by 9 percent when factoring in inflation. (Data for 2018 is not available yet.)\n\nThe nation as a whole has seen some income stagnation since 1999, but nothing as severe as West Virginia experienced. Nationally, median incomes have risen every year since 2014 and hit an all-time high in 2017.\n\nComparing the specific years Romano used \u2014 2007 to 2017 \u2014 the national figure rose by 3 percent.\n\nRomano wrote that \"adjusting for inflation, West Virginia\u2019s median household income has not grown in a decade.\" West Virginia\u2019s inflation-adjusted median income has dropped 9 percent in the last decade, even as the national figure has risen by 3 percent. We rate his statement True.", "lang": "en"}
