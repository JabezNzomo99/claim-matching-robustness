It said the $116 billion estimate would be more accurately accounted as ranging from $3.3 billion to $15.6 billion if those costs were considered.\n\nAdditionally, the American Immigration Council studied an earlier but similar estimate by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. It concluded that education and health care account for more than half of the costs, and that the benefits were afforded to many American-citizen children of undocumented immigrants.", "lang": "en"}
