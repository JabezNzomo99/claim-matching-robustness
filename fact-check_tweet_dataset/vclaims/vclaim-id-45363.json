A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania State Police confirmed that there is no prohibition on individuals with concealed carry permits wearing masks during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDemocratic Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf announced on April 15 an executive order requiring employees and patrons to wear face coverings while inside businesses that serve the public. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone wear face coverings in public to help curb the spread of coronavirus.\n\nIn recent weeks, some social media users have shared posts claiming it is illegal for concealed carry permit holders to wear such masks under \u201cSection 34-9 (A.1B)\u201d of Pennsylvania law.\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any \u201cSection 34-9 (A.1B)\u201d pertaining to concealed carry permits and masks, nor any Pennsylvania statute barring holders of such permits from wearing masks. Joshua Prince, chief counsel for the Firearms Industry Consulting Group, told the Caller in an email that the cited statute \u201cis either wholly made up or comes from a different state that has such a statutory section.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile each state\u2019s laws are different, in Pennsylvania, there is no law criminalizing the wearing of a mask, while lawfully carrying a firearm,\u201d Prince said. (RELATED: Is Pennsylvania Fining And Jailing People For Not Wearing Masks In Public?)\n\nPennsylvania State Police Communications Director Ryan Tarkowski confirmed to the Caller that the post\u2019s claim was \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cSections 6106 and 6109 of the Uniform Firearms Act speak to carrying a concealed firearm and applying for a license to carry in Pennsylvania. The law is silent on the issue of masks,\u201d Tarkowski explained in an email. \u201cThere is no prohibition in Pennsylvania on license to carry permit holders wearing a mask during the ongoing COVID-19 mitigation efforts.\u201d\n\nAs of noon on June 9, there have been more than 74,200 confirmed coronavirus cases and some 6,000 deaths in Pennsylvania, according to the state\u2019s Department of Health website.", "lang": "en"}
