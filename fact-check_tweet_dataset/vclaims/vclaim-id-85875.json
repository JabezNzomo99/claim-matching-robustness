And health insurance exchanges are the centerpiece of this reform because they are the places that individuals can go to shop for their new, securely-priced health insurance. But if they\u2019re not set up in a way which is transparent, and which is convenient for shoppers, and which allow people to use their tax credits and use them effectively to buy health insurance it will undercut the whole purpose of the bill. Now, a number of states have expressed no interest in doing so. \u2026 Only about 10 states have moved forward aggressively in setting up their exchanges. \u2026 I guess I\u2019m enough a believer in democracy to think that when the voters of the state see that by not setting up an exchange, the politicians in the state are costing residents hundreds of millions and billions of dollars, that they\u2019ll eventually throw the guys out. But I don\u2019t know that for sure. And that is really the ultimate threat: Will people understand that, \u2018Gee, if your governor doesn\u2019t set up an exchange, you\u2019re losing hundreds of millions of dollars to be delivered to your citizens?\u2019 So that\u2019s the other threat, will states do what they need to do to set it up.\u201d\n\nQuestion: You mentioned the health-information exchanges for the states, and it is my understanding that if states don\u2019t provide them, then the federal government will provide them for the states. Gruber: Yeah, so these health-insurance Exchanges, you can go on . Yeah, so these health-insurance Exchanges, you can go on ma.healthconnector.org and see ours in Massachusetts, will be these new shopping places and they\u2019ll be the place that people go to get their subsidies for health insurance In the law, it says if the states don\u2019t provide them, the federal backstop will. The federal government has been sort of slow in putting out its back-stop, I think partly because they want to sort of squeeze the states to do it. I think what\u2019s important to remember politically about this, is if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits. But your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill. So you\u2019re essentially saying to your citizens, you\u2019re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country. I hope that\u2019s a blatant enough political reality that states will get their act together and realize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges, and that they\u2019ll do it. But you know, once again, the politics can get ugly around this.\n\nHowever, he does touch on this point during his extemporaneous explanation later in the House hearing: \u201cAs I said in my opening remarks, my statement, while poorly worded and much too glib, but I believe the point I was making was that at the time I gave that statement, which was 2012, it was not clear how effective the federal exchange would be. It was not even clear who would be in the White House to implement said federal exchange. And as a result, states might be concerned the federal exchange would not be implemented and they would have to set up their own exchange.\u201d\n\nDid anyone really think there was a possibility the federal exchange would not be set up at all, around late 2011 or early 2012? It depends on who you ask. Some experts say yes; there was minimum guidance to states or regulations for exchanges, and the ongoing delays made it seem like it might never happen. But many others say no; they expected delays, but there was never a doubt there would eventually be an exchange \u2014 state or federal \u2014 in all states. After all, it was a statutory requirement.", "lang": "en"}
