Mr Mitchell accompanied Shadow Minister for Transport and Infrastructure Anthony Albanese as he outlined ALP\u2019s pledge to spend $1.3 billion on road upgrades across the island state. [1]\n\nMr Mitchell holds the marginal Labor seat of Lyons by 3.8 per cent. Lyons is Tasmania\u2019s largest electorate which includes the northern agricultural districts between Launceston and the Tamar River in the east and Devonport and Latrobe in the west. It also includes towns on the state's east coast, rural areas of the central and southern midlands, the Derwent Valley and areas on the edge of greater Hobart. [2]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Mitchell\u2019s claim that not a single new major road project has commenced under the coalition government since it was elected in 2013, that Labor had not already started.\n\nMr Mitchell told AAP FactCheck he was referring to road projects but wouldn\u2019t clarify what he meant by \u201cmajor\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for the government sent AAP FactCheck a list of a number of road projects commenced since it came to power in 2013.\n\nThe list, from the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities, included 13 road projects promised and commenced by the coalition since 2013. Five projects on the list have been completed and eight have been started. Eleven are jointly funded by state and federal governments. The two that are solely federal-funded are $2.5 million for Soldiers Settlement Road and $3.46 million for the Industry Road upgrade.\n\nThe jointly-funded projects include a $12.5 million upgrade to the Murchison Highway, a key freight and passenger route connecting the state\u2019s west and north, as well as $8.92 million for the Highland Lakes Road and a $2.88 million Bass Highway upgrade.\n\nAnother jointly-funded project is the $30 million Hobart Airport Interchange. Tenders for the project have been called and construction is due to begin in October.\n\nA media report about the $12.5 million Murchison Highway upgrade states the project was promised by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in the 2018 Braddon by-election, and despite losing that poll, the project went ahead. [3]\n\nWorks commenced on the Murchison Highway upgrade in December 2018, and are expected to finish in February 2020. [4]\n\nBased on this evidence AAP FactCheck found Mr Mitchell\u2019s claim that the government had failed to commence a single major road project since it was elected to be false.", "lang": "en"}
