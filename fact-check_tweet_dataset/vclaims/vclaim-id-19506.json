This is false; Airtel Nigeria told AFP the company is not running any such promotion at this time, and urged people to disregard the fake Facebook page.\n\nThe Facebook post, on a page named \u201cAirtel Our World\u201d, has been shared nearly 6,000 times since it was published on August 1. We\u2019ve archived the post here. It says the company is handing out 500,000 Apple iPhones to Airtel users \u201cto appreciate all their support so far\u201d.\n\nWe contacted the Airtel Nigeria customer relations centre via social media. They told us the company was not running any such promotion.\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that we currently do not have any ongoing giveaway promo on the Airtel network. Kindly disregard the information,\u201d Airtel said.\n\nWhy do scams like this exist?\n\nThis sort of scam is popular in Nigeria; it is used to attract followers to a new Facebook page and for gathering the names, phone numbers and other personal details of unsuspecting Facebook users.\n\nAccording to Facebook\u2019s Page Transparency -- a section which shows \u201cinformation to help you better understand the purpose of a Page\u201d and \u201csee actions taken by the people who manage and post content\u201d -- the page was created on July 28, 2019.\n\nIn 12 days, the page has racked up more than 12,500 followers by posting pictures of phones and claiming to be giving them out for free. We\u2019ve archived some of the other posts on the page here, here, and here.\n\nAs in some other parts of the world, social media accounts are often sold in Nigeria. After gaining a large number of followers and a degree of influence, the accounts can be sold and used for other purposes.\n\nAFP found this Facebook page where such accounts are bought and sold.\n\nThe same type of trade exists on Twitter and Instagram -- here\u2019s a screenshot of a tweet announcing the sale of an Instagram account it claims has over 200,000 followers.", "lang": "en"}
