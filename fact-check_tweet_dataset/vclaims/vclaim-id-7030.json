McCarthy rose to prominence in 1950, the Wisconsin Republican claimed in his \u201cEnemies From Within\u201d speech that he had obtained a list of 205 communists who were working in the State Department. His ensuing campaign lasted four years, and he \u201chad not been able to produce even one identified Communist Party member in the State Department,\u201d The New York Times wrote when Mr. McCarthy died.\n\nBy comparison, the Russia investigation has so far spanned one year and yielded five guilty pleas.\n\nOverall, the McCarthyism campaign touched 12,000 to 13,000 people. It forced employees from their jobs in 100 cases, said Ellen Schrecker, a historian.\n\nIn that sense, the Russia investigation is \u201cnot a witch hunt,\u201d said Ms. Schrecker, who for decades has researched the era of McCarthyism. She said the Russia investigation that had enraged Mr. Trump was opened \u201cbecause of what his campaign did, not because of his political beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for evidence backing up Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that he has led \u201cthe most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history.\u201d But in the past, the president has noted the number of bills he has signed, deregulation and the appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court to prove this point.\n\nSeventeen months into his presidency, Mr. Trump has signed the second-fewest bills among the last 10 presidents, said Joshua Tauberer, the creator of GovTrack, a web tool for tracking legislation. (President Barack Obama had signed the fewest by this point in his first term.)", "lang": "en"}
