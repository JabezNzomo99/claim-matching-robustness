The question continues to spark debate in state legis", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-76224", "url": "http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2016/mar/21/kip-kendrick/rep-kip-kendrick-half-right-voter-id-statement/", "vclaim": "According to the Secretary of State\u2019s office, that number came from comparing the list of registered voters in Missouri to the Department of Revenue\u2019s accounting of those without driver\u2019s licenses (about 150,000 people) and those with expired driver\u2019s licenses (about 70,000).\n\nThe note sets aside up to $10.7 million to cover costs associated with providing new photo IDs. That\u2019s because unless the House Budget and Senate Appropriations committees allocate the necessary funding to provide photo ID at no charge for those currently without, the state would be barred from implementing the new requirements. \u201cAmerica has 133 million registered voters,\u201d but \u201c159 million votes\u201d were cast in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nKendrick\u2019s source, Secretary of State Jason Kander\u2019s report, doesn\u2019t take this information into account. Kander\u2019s report is two years old and refers to an older bill that did not require the state to bear the cost of providing supporting documentation necessary for photo ID \u2014 theoretically making the requirement of photo ID a poll tax.\n\nIt also includes funding for an updated DMV website; new hires in the Department of Revenue, the Department of Health and Senior Service, and the Bureau of Vital records; and pre-election TV, radio, and print ads to let voters know of the change in ID requirements.\n\nMissouri League of Women Voters President Elaine Blodgett said the costs associated with the new IDs go beyond creating a new document. \"There\u2019s an undue burden on women, who might have to get their birth certificates and marriage certificates and divorce certificates in order to get photo ID, if they\u2019ve changed their names,\" she said. \"Also, simply getting to all the offices needed can be nearly impossible for some of our disabled or elderly voters.\"\n\nKendrick told Politifact Missouri that older adults may have issues tracking down birth certificates because states don\u2019t necessarily have the same standards for maintaining birth records. He also added a time qualifier to his earlier statement and said \"if voter photo ID was in place right now, over 200,000 registered MO voters would not be able to vote.\"\n\nIn addition, even with the plan outlined in the bill\u2019s fiscal note, some voters may still remain unaware of the new requirements. If voters came to the polls without the correct ID, they could cast provisional ballots; but in the 2012 presidential election, fewer than 3 in 10 provisional ballots were counted because many voters did not return to verify their address or identity after casting a provisional ballot.\n\nNo one knows exactly how many Missourians would be affected by new photo ID requirements \u2014 but there is consensus that the number who would need new photo IDs is in the hundreds of thousands.
