In this case, a viral article claims Africans are genetically resistant to the novel respiratory virus.\n\nThe article said that 21-year-old Cameroonian student Kem Senou Pavel Daryl\u2019s recovery from COVID-19 helped Chinese doctors make the discovery.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese doctors confirmed that Senou stayed alive because of his blood genetic composition which is mainly found in the genetic composition of subsaharan Africans,\u201d the article claims. \u201cChinese doctors also said that he remained alive because he had black skin, the antibodies of a black are 3 times stronger, powerful and resistant compare (sic) to that of white.\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old student contracted COVID-19 while living in the Chinese city of Jingzhou and suffered from a fever, cough and other flu-like symptoms, according to BBC News.\n\nThere is, however, no scientific evidence suggesting that Africans have a better chance of fighting the coronavirus. In fact, a medical epidemiologist and a microbiologist debunked the claim in an email to the DCNF.\n\n\u201cThis claim is entirely false,\u201d Washington State University epidemiologist Isaac Ngere said. \u201cNo scientific proof that Africans have any immunity to COVID-19 or any coronaviruses.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Cocaine \u2018Kills\u2019 The Coronavirus)\n\nPaul Hunter, a microbiologist at the University of East Anglia, called the article\u2019s claim that Africans are less genetically susceptible to the coronavirus \u201cabsolute rubbish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true that in the 2002/2003 SARS epidemic only one case was identified in Africa (South Africa). Also during the 2009 influenza pandemic Africa suffered less than on other continents,\u201d said Hunter. \u201cHowever, this is more likely to be because of other geographical factors (i.e. generally lower population densities and Africans spend more time out of doors where transmission is less effective than Europeans do, especially in winter). No evidence that any of these factors are down to immunity.\u201d\n\nAs of Feb. 27, the WHO has documented at least two cases of COVID-19 in Africa \u2013 one in Egypt and one in Algeria. Nigeria confirmed its first case of coronavirus and the first in sub-Saharan Africa in Lagos on Feb. 28, The New York Times reported.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
