As per social media claims, the man is an ISIS terrorist who was apprehended in Spain.\n\nTwitter user Akash RSS posted the viral video along with the same claim.\n\nAkash RSS is \u2018Akash Soni\u2019. In a 2017 report, Alt News had found that he was running the popular fake news website Coverage Times. Another report published in June 2018 revealed that he was part of the group behind misinformation and propaganda Facebook page \u2018BJP All India\u2019. Soni was also found to be behind the targetted harassment of journalist Ravish Kumar through a WhatsApp group.\n\nAlt News has received several requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News performed a keyframe analysis and a subsequent reverse image on Google using InVid, a video analysis tool. We found that Vimeo user \u2018Prensamerica Internacional\u2019 had uploaded the same video six years ago. As per the video description, the kidnapper was H\u00e9ctor Duarte and the incident took place in Venezuela.\n\nUsing this as clue Alt News performed a keyword search on Google and found that this incident is known as \u20181998 C\u00faa hostage crisis\u2019. It took place in C\u00faa, a city located in the Miranda State of Venezuela.\n\nAnother keyword search using the Spanish phrase \u2018Crisis de rehenes de C\u00faa 1998\u2019 (translates to \u20181998 C\u00faa hostage crisis\u2019) on YouTube led us to the clip aired by Venevisi\u00f3n, a Venezuelan-based TV channel. A longer clip was uploaded by YouTube channel NotiVideosHeinnermix which has close 20 lakh views. This video was uploaded in 2011.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal interviewed Iv\u00e1n Simonovis, police chief who was the in-charge of the rescue operation. \u201cHe [Simonovis] created the country\u2019s first SWAT team, the Brigada de Acciones Especiales. In 1998 BAE acquired an international profile when one of its snipers shot dead a gunman who\u2019d taken a woman hostage in the town of C\u00faa, 40 miles from Caracas,\u201d reads the published shared in 2019.\n\nThe video has been doing the rounds on social media at least since 2017 with false claims. Back then Boom and The Qunit had verified the clip.\n\nThus the social media claim that the video shows an ISIS terrorist in Spain is false. The incident shows a scene from a robbery that took place 22 years ago in Venezuela.", "lang": "en"}
