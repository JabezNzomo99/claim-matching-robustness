Mike DeWine authorized the release of 4,300 inmates on May 15.\n\nThere is no evidence DeWine released 4,300 inmates on May 15. A spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections said the post \u201cis not accurate.\u201d\n\nSeveral states have released inmates in an effort to contain the spread of the new coronavirus behind bars, according to The New York Times. This particular post claims DeWine freed 4,300 inmates on May 15.\n\n\u201cOhio governor released 4,300 prisoners today!\u201d the viral post reads. \u201cNow he is warning residents of possible crime wave! Seriously you can\u2019t fix stupid!!\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any evidence that DeWine released 4,300 inmates on that date. Had he done so, media outlets would have reported it, as some did when DeWine authorized the release of 105 inmates on April 15, yet no news coverage could be found.\n\nDeWine also sent out a tweet when he authorized the release of 105 inmates.\n\n\u201cEarlier today, I approved the early release of 105 inmates in Ohio,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cEach inmate will be tested to determine if they have #COVID19 before release.\u201d\n\nBut a search of DeWine\u2019s verified social media accounts turned up no announcement about such a release of over 4,000 inmates on May 15.

Over 4,700 Ohio inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus and just over 70 confirmed others have died as of May 28, according to data from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections.\n\nEarlier this month, a group of inmates filed a class-action lawsuit against DeWine and the state\u2019s prison director, asking the judge to free thousands of inmates who are older or have medical conditions that put them at serious health risk if they contract the coronavirus, Cleveland Plain Dealer reported.", "lang": "en"}
