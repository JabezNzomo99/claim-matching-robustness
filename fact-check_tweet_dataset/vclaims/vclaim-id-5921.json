The images in these claims are altered. While a type of dye is sometimes used on rhino in anti-poaching initiatives, the process bears no resemblance to these photos.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nOne post reads: \u201cOne of the most brilliant things I\u2019ve ever seen against poaching. They use the same pink dye that is used to mark stolen banknotes. This makes the ivory of the tusks unsaleable and cannot be cleaned. The animals are not harmed and this initiative is saving their lives.\u201d\n\nThe posts feature photographs of an elephant and rhinos with bright pink tusks or horns. The photographs are clearly altered.\n\nOriginal versions of the rhino photograph are stock photos visible here and here . The earliest the unedited elephant photograph appeared online is 2009 ( here , see likely source here ).\n\nIt is true that various organizations like Rhino Rescue Project and Sabi Sand Game Reserve are infusing rhino horns with a type of poison and dyes to prevent poaching, but these processes do not resemble the images portrayed on social media here , and here ).\n\n\u201cAlthough it may be fun to imagine herds of rhino roaming the African savannah with pretty pink horns,\u201d the Rhino Rescue Project writes in a FAQ addressing this sort of misinformation, \u201cone has to guard against reducing a scientific intervention into nothing more than a frivolous Facebook or Twitter rumour.\u201d (see question seven, rhinorescueproject.org/faq/ )\n\nThe Rhino Rescue Project explains the process on its website: \u201cTo devalue the horn, it is treated by infusing it with a compound made up of ectoparasiticides and indelible dye that contaminates the horn and renders it useless for ornamental or medicinal use.\u201d The procedure can be seen in more detail here .\n\nWhile dye is used in the process, it does not resemble the photographs online. Rhino Rescue says \u201chorn devaluation is a much more involved process than simply dyeing the surface of a horn pink,\u201d or any other color. It clarifies its \u201coften misunderstood methodology\u201d on its website and why a bright pink dye as pictured in these claims would not be feasible.\n\nFirstly, due to the wild nature of the animals\u2019 activities, \u201cthe colour would not be visible for long enough to act as a deterrent,\u201d and secondly, any specific coloration or discoloration of certain animals \u201cmakes every other animal in a population without a coloured horn an even softer target for poachers.\u201d\n\nArticles explaining this process using edited photographs ( here ) or petitions for the dying of tusks ( here ) may have contributed to this misinformation spreading online.\n\nFor elephant tusks, on the other hand, this sort of initiative is not an easy option, as explained here .\n\nThe International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) says dying horns and tusks pink would not work ( here ) because elephant tusks can grow as fast as an inch per year and re-dying the tusk each year after its grown out is \u201cunrealistic\u201d .\n\nAmong the other risks associated with this sort of initiative on elephants, IFAW lists, \u201ccapturing, sedating and dying the tusks of as many as 400,000 elephants is logistically impossible; the disruption and distress caused to these elephants could be detrimental to individuals and families; the number of elephants killed in the process would likely be sizeable; and the process would have to be repeated every few years or so.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa is home to about 80% of the world\u2019s rhino population. Details of rhino population numbers left per species can be seen here . In the decade between 2009-2019, 9,642 African rhinos were killed by poachers ( here ).\n\nThe population of elephants around the world decreased by 62% between 2002 and 2011 largely due to poaching ( here ).\n\nAltered. While some wildlife organizations inject dye into the horns of rhinos to prevent poaching, it does not make the horn appear bright pink. These photographs are altered.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact-checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
