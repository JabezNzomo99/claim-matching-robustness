The account\u2019s biography includes the hashtag \u201c#fakenews.\u201d\n\nFacebook posts also amplified the falsehood, gaining thousands of shares in a number of hours.\n\nThe photo was indeed taken in Seattle \u2014 but it actually shows a Black Lives Matter protest from early June.\n\nA reverse image search of the picture brought us to a post on the website westseattleblog.com. The June 6 post identified the photo as a protest in West Seattle and credited the image to Paul Weatherman.\n\nWeatherman, who identifies on Twitter as a Seattle-based aerial photographer, posted the image and others the same day on Twitter.\n\nMail-in voting is nothing new for Washington, which is one of five states that already conducts \u201call-mail elections,\u201d according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAnother 29 states and Washington, D.C., have \u201cno excuse\u201d absentee or mail-in voting, according to NCSL, meaning anyone can choose to vote by mail without specifying a reason. And about a quarter of ballots cast in the 2018 general elections nationwide were by mail, as we\u2019ve explained before.\n\nBut amid a push for mail-in voting in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are concerns that Trump\u2019s opposition to additional funding for the cash-strapped U.S. Postal Service and operational changes made by the new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, would prevent the Postal Service from handling the increase in mail-in ballots.\n\nOn Aug. 18, the postmaster general announced that he would be \u201csuspending\u201d such \u201coperational initiatives\u201d until after the election is concluded \u2014 \u201c[t]o avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail.\u201d\n\nThere have been some protests in recent days targeted at DeJoy, including in North Carolina and Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump and his reelection campaign have attempted to undermine the process of mail-in voting \u2014 drawing false distinctions between mail-in and absentee ballots, for example, and advancing the specter of potential fraud by using faulty premises.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
