It has been claimed that this new currency note has been launched by the RBI. The two images supposedly represent the obverse and reverse side of the currency note.\n\nOn Facebook, several individual users have posted these images with the identical claim. The 1000 rupee currency note had been discontinued by the government following the announcement of demonetization in November 2016.\n\nAlt News also received requests for verification of these images on it official Android application.\n\nA close look at the image reveals that it is merely an artistic creation, and NOT representative of a new currency note launched by the RBI. There are two key giveaways.\n\n1. On the right side of the image, the words \u2018artistic imagination\u2019 can be seen. This itself confirms that the image is an artistic creation.\n\n2. Below the words \u2018artistic imagination\u2019, the \u2018note\u2019 bears the signature of not the RBI governor, but M K Gandhi.\n\nMoreover, Alt News checked the \u2018notifications\u2019 and \u2018press releases\u2019 section of the website of the RBI, and found that there has been no communication from the central bank regarding the same.\n\nAlt News found these images had been uploaded on YouTube as early as February 2019.\n\nIt may be noted that the RBI has NOT introduced a new currency note of 1000 denomination. The image circulated on social media is an artistic creation. This was fact-checked earlier by SMHoaxSlayer and Boom.", "lang": "en"}
