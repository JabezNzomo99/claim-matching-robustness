We\u2019ve listed the statements in order, from the least egregious to the most outlandish, to demonstrate how \u2014 almost like a game of telephone \u2014 the facts get increasingly unmoored from the actual data. It\u2019s a complex issue, which leads itself to facile explanations.\n\nObama\u2019s statement, coming during a prepared speech rather than an impromptu debate comment, is carefully phrased. He reaches back several decades, and asserts that more drug offenders, for longer than ever before, have been locked up. \u201cThat\u2019s is the real reason our population is so high,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is clearly wrong,\u201d said Jonathan P. Caulkins, professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cThe proportion of prison inmates who were drug law violators has been pretty nearly flat at 20 percent since 1990,\u201d he said, referring to combined federal and state figures. \u201cSo the number of drug law violators in prison was increasing from 1990 until fairly recently, and that may have been bad policy, but the number of people in prison on non-drug offenses was rising just as fast, as indicated by drug law violators\u2019 proportion holding more or less constant.\u201d\n\nFordham University Professor John Pfaff, who has closely studied the data, said that in the states, 52 percent of the growth in prison populations between 1980 and 2009 came from locking up violent offenders, compared to just 21 percent for drug offenders. \u201cIf we just look at 1990 to 2009 (the period of falling crime), locking up violent offenders explains 60 percent of the growth, to just 14 percent for drug offenders,\u201d he said. Moreover, he said the growth came from admitting more people to prison, not from longer sentences as the president asserted.\n\nThe White House said that the president was not claiming the proportion of non-violent drug offenders has increased. Instead, he was noting that the total number of incarcerated individuals would be much lower \u2014 in both state and federal prisons \u2014 were it not for the large number of non-violent drug offenders who are incarcerated.\n\nIn 2014, there were 1.56 million prisoners in federal and state prisons. The rate of imprisonment is actually at its lowest rate in a decade, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Of the inmates, more than 50 percent were convicted of violent offenses, while only 15.7 percent were incarcerated on drug charges. (Just 3.6 percent were in prison for drug possession, while 12.1 percent were jailed for trafficking or other serious drug offenses.)\n\nFiorina is more on target if you look just at federal prisons. In a report issued in October, BJS said that more than half of all federal prison inmates were convicted of drug trafficking, often for dealing in cocaine. Adding in other nonviolent offenses, such as property and immigration, gets you to two-thirds of the federally sentenced offenders.\n\nBut from the context of Fiorina\u2019s statement \u2014 she had just mentioned the factoid about the U.S. having 25 percent of the world\u2019s prisoners \u2014 she must have been referring to state and federal prisons. And in that instance she is off base.\n\nSanders said that \u201cwe are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana.\u201d Sanders would have been on safer ground if he had just referred to arrests because arrest rates for marijuana possession are at near-record high rates, according to the FBI. In 2014, at least 620,000 people were arrested for pot possession.\n\nBut while the consequences of an arrest can be great, Sanders erred by suggesting most of these arrests lead to prison terms. As noted previously, just 3.6 percent of inmates in state and federal prisons were incarcerated for drug possession. In fiscal year 2014, in the federal system, just 187 inmates (0.9 percent) were sentenced for simple drug possession \u2014 of which 75 were jailed for marijuana possession. Ninety-seven percent of drug offenders were convicted of drug trafficking.", "lang": "en"}
