The European Union did not exist as an organisation at the time, but its predecessor organisation, the European Community (EC), imposed both an arms embargo and a ban on Argentine imports.\n\nThe Bulletin of the European Communities from 1982 records that the EC \u201cdemanded an immediate cessation of hostilities and an immediate withdrawal of all Argentine forces from the Falkland Islands\u201d and that it had imposed \u201ca total ban on exports of arms and military equipment to Argentina\u201d.\n\nIn a speech to Parliament in April 1982, when British forces were on their way to the islands, the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced that the UK government had asked its allies to put economic pressure against Argentina, and \u201cachieved a heartening degree of success\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe most significant measure,\u201d Mrs Thatcher said, \u201chas been the decision of our nine partners in the European Community to join us not just in an arms embargo but also in stopping all imports from Argentina.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important step, unprecedented in its scope and the rapidity of the decision... I should like warmly to thank our European partners for rallying to our support. It was an effective demonstration of Community solidarity.\u201d\n\nThe post may refer to the fact that Argentina had bought several Exocet missiles from France before the war started. But it\u2019s not correct to say that France, or any other EC country, sold Argentina weapons during the war.\n\nThere have been reports that a French technical team remained in Argentina, where they allegedly helped to repair three missile launchers. If so, the former chief of staff of the DGSE, the French foreign intelligence service, told the BBC that this would be \u201cbordering on an act of treason\u201d. However he also told the BBC that one of the team members was a spy, sharing information about the Argentine forces.", "lang": "en"}
