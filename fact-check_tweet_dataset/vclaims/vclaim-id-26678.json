Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Robbery video taken at Sarvodaya Mandir in Ghatkopar (Mumbai). Fact: The incident happened in Karachi, not in Mumbai. Gulshan-e-Iqbal Police (Karachi) have already arrested two minor children who were involved in the robbery. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, a tweet by \u2018Dawn News\u2019 on the incident can be found in the search results. \u2018Dawn News\u2019 has tweeted the same video with the hashtags \u2018#Karachi #Robbery #DawnNews #Pakistan\u2019.\n\nAlso, many YouTube videos about the incident can be found in the search results. One of YouTube videos has the title \u2018Children Arrested by Gulshan Police\u2019. So when searched on Google with the keywords in Urdu, a news article about this incident was found in the search results. In the article, it can be read that \u2018Gulshan-e-Iqbal police have arrested two minor children who were found guilty of robbery near Hill Park in Gulshan-e-Iqbal area of \u200b\u200bKarachi.\u2019\n\nTo sum it up, Karachi robbery video is being falsely shared as robbery in Mumbai.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
