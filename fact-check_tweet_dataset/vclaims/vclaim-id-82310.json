We demonstrated how the state rankings changed dramatically when suicides are removed from the gun deaths\u2014and the evidence is mixed on whether restricting gun purchases would affect the overall suicide rate. In any case, the president\u2019s policy proposals are aimed at mass shootings, not suicides. He earned Two Pinocchios.\n\n2: Clinton\u2019s claim that 40 percent of guns are sold at gun shows and over the Internet\n\nFormer secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton cited a stale statistic\u2014and then got it wrong, claiming that \u201cforty percent of guns are sold at gun shows, online sales.\u201d The 40-percent figure refers to all gun transactions, not just gun sales. A large percentage of the gun transactions not covered by background checks are family and friend transactions \u2013 which would have been exempt from the universal background checks pushed by Democrats. Clinton earned Three Pinocchios.\n\n3: Cruz\u2019s claim that he spent \u2018much of my adult life in law enforcement\u2019\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) claimed that he \u201cspent much of my adult life working in law enforcement.\u201d But we found he was exaggerating his law-enforcement credentials. To say that \u201cmuch\u201d of his adult life was spent in law enforcement really suggests at least half of his career, whereas the best-case scenario would be one-third. Even then, he was never a prosecutor or litigated criminal cases \u2014 and in private practice, he defended criminals. He earned Three Pinocchios.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) made a bold claim at one of the GOP debates, so we did a deep dive into the evidence concerning Clinton\u2019s public and private statements on the 2012 Benghazi attacks. A \u201clie\u201d suggests a deliberate effort to deceive, but we found the documentary evidence suggests there were few hard answers available then to policymakers. Rubio earned Two Pinocchios.\n\n5: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s claim that the bottom 90 percent got \u2018zero percent\u2019 of wage growth after Reagan\n\nWe examined the evidence for Sen. Warren\u2019s frequent assertion about income inequality, often made in a highly partisan manner. This is a case in which the outcome depends on the data selected. Broadly speaking, most economists would agree the income growth has increasingly benefited the top 10 percent. Warren\u2019s reasons for that \u2014 and her specific numbers \u2014 are certainly debatable. But the issue was murky enough that in the end we did not award a rating.", "lang": "en"}
