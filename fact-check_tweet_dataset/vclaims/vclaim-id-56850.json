The claim is false; the photo has circulated in media reports since 2013 about a safety training session for female journalists in the Philippines; the local news website that first published the photo issued a statement denying the claim, saying the photo was being used \u201cmaliciously\u201d.\n\nThe photo was posted here on Facebook on May 16, 2020. It has been shared more than 400 times.\n\nIt is part of a collage of three photos; the other two show journalist Rowena Paraan, the head of the \u201cBayan Mo, Ipatrol Mo\u201d citizen journalism project at Philippine\u2019s biggest television network, ABS-CBN.\n\nThe post\u2019s Tagalog-language caption states: \"ABS CBN is really protecting NPAs\".\n\nThe Tagalog text overlay in the collage translates to English as: \"AAAAAY BUSTED !! PLEASE EXPLAIN. / What is the real link between Rowena Paraan, (NUJP) Head of Bayan Mo, Ipatrol Mo, of ABS-CBN,,, and the CPP-NPA-NDF??? / WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE MOUNTAINS?\"\n\n\u201cNUJP\u201d is the acronym for the \u201cNational Union of Journalists of the Philippines\u201d, a media organisation Paraan previously chaired.\n\n\u201cCPP-NPA-NDF\u201d are acronyms for the communist rebellion in the Philippines: the \u201cCommunist Party of the Philippines\u201d and its armed wing, the \u201cNew People's Army\u201d, and its political arm, the \u201cNational Democratic Front\u201d.\n\nPhilippines\u2019 leading broadcaster ABS-CBN was forced to go off-air earlier this month over its stalled broadcasting licence renewal, sparking fears that the government is stifling press freedom in the country. President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly attacked the network in his speeches and accused it of not airing one of his campaign advertisements during the 2016 presidential election, as reported by AFP here.\n\nThe photo was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nA combined keyword and reverse image search on Google found the same photo published in this March 17, 2013 report by MindaNews, a Philippine media organisation based in Mindanao island.\n\nThe photo caption states: \u201cNUJP chair Rowena Paraan (in NUJP shirt) gives first aid training during the all-women safety training for Mindanao journalists and media workers on March 16 and 17 in Cagayan de Oro City.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the MindaNews\u2019 report (R):\n\nMindaNews issued this statement on May 15, 2020, saying it \u201cvehemently condemns\u201d the \u201cmalicious\u201d use of its photo in the misleading posts.\n\nIt reads in part: \u201cA MindaNews photograph of a simulation exercise during the first aid module of the country\u2019s first all-women media safety training in Cagayan de Oro City in March 2013 has been maliciously used to red-tag a journalist, an act MindaNews vehemently condemns.\u201d\n\nThe NUJP also issued a statement on its website here on May 15, 2020 which states: \u201cThe National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) condemns the malicious and deplorable use of photographs of the first all-women media safety training held in the Philippines to red-tag our former chairperson, colleagues and the NUJP.\n\n\u201cIt is utterly shameless but dangerous that a historic media safety training aimed at protecting and ensuring the safety of media workers is being used to malign, threaten and put journalists and the NUJP in danger.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Paraan directed AFP to this photo published on 22 March 2013 on the Facebook page of Rommel L. Rutor, a tutor who was present at the 2013 safety training exercise.\n\nClose examination of the photo shows a group of people posed around a banner reading \u201cFirst All Women RISK AWARENESS AND MEDIA SAFETY TRAINING\u201d. It also shows Paraan and the man purportedly being tended to in the misleading posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook photo, with the following circled in red by AFP: Paraan (L); the banner (C); and the man labelled as a rebel as in the misleading posts (R):", "lang": "en"}
