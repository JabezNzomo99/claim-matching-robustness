Just listen to his rationale!\u201d (RELATED: Did The Obama Foundation Tweet An Image Of George Floyd Before His Death?)\n\nIn the video, the teenaged defendant, identified as George Floyd IV, says he stole and then crashed the plaintiff\u2019s car while fleeing Chicago police. The incident appears to be the same one described in a Dec. 7, 2009, article published by NBC 5 Chicago.\n\nBut the young man, George Floyd IV, is not the same man as the late 46-year-old George Perry Floyd Jr., who died in Minneapolis police custody in May. A spokesperson for \u201cJudge Judy\u201d told the Daily Caller in an email that the episode aired in 2010. Born in 1973, George Perry Floyd Jr. would have been about 36 at that time. The young man in the video would today be in his mid-to-late 20s.\n\nPhotos of George Perry Floyd Jr. as a teenager and as an adult show that he resembles neither the defendant nor the defendant\u2019s father, who also has a similar name.", "lang": "en"}
