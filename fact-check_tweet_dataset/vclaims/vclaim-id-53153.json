The claim is misleading; the photo does not show the purported plant; a project to resurrect an ancient Arctic plant was led by a team of Russian scientists in 2012, more than eight years before the misleading posts were published.\n\nThe image was published in this post on June 22, 2020, and has been shared more than 2,300 times.\n\nThe Sinhala-language text superimposed on the image translates to English as: \u201cRussian scientists these days are working on resurrecting a variety of flowers that bloomed in the vicinity of the polar caps, some 32,000 years ago. As a squirrel that lived in the ice age had taken a seed of the plant to another location, the scientists have been able to breed the plant using that seed.\u201d\n\nThe same image was shared here and here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe photo has been shared in a misleading context.\n\nA reverse image search on Google for the photo found this Getty Images picture. It is captioned: \u201cPurple Arctic Flowers and Icebergs from Jakobshavn Glacier - stock photo.\u201d\n\nThe caption goes on to state: \u201cIcebergs from the Jacobshavn glacier or Sermeq Kujalleq drains 7% of the Greenland ice sheet and is the largest glacier outside of Antarctica. It calves enough ice in one day to supply New York with water for one year. It is one of the fastest moving glaciers in the world at up to 40 meters per day (19 meters per day before 2002) and has also receded rapidly (40 km since 1850) due to human induced climate change as temperatures have risen in Greenland by 9 degrees fahrenheit in the last 60 years. An underwater moraine at the mouth of the fjord grounds the largest icebergs causing a backlog of ice completely blocking the entire length of the fjord with ice.\u201d\n\nThere is no mention of the purported study by Russian scientists.\n\nThe purple arctic flower, also known as the purple saxifrage, is among one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the Arctic during spring.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading posts (L) and the Getty Images photo (R):\n\nA keyword search on Google found the reference to a study by Russian scientists relates to a breakthrough in resurrecting a 32,000-year-old flower in 2012. This New York Times article published on February 20, 2012, is titled \u201cDead for 32,000 years, an Arctic plant is revived.\u201d\n\nAccording to the piece, scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences were successful in reviving the Arctic flower.\n\nThe article reads: \u201cLiving plants have been generated from the fruit of a little arctic flower, the narrow-leafed campion, that died 32,000 years ago, a team of Russian scientists reports. The fruit was stored by an arctic ground squirrel in its burrow on the tundra of northeastern Siberia and lay permanently frozen until excavated by scientists a few years ago.\n\n\u201cThis would be the oldest plant by far that has ever been grown from ancient tissue. The present record is held by a date palm grown from a seed some 2,000 years old that was recovered from the ancient fortress of Masada in Israel.\u201d\n\nNational Geographic also published a piece on February 20, 2012, on the same success. The article quotes one of the lead scientists, Svetlana Yashina, who said the successfully revived plant variety -- S.Stenophylla -- is still around, but the ancient plants are \u201csubtly different to their modern counterparts\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
