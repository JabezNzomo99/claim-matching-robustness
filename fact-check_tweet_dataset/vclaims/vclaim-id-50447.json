Health officials and media outlets debunked that one, and we rated it False.\n\nNow comes a supposed remedy that\u2019s a bit more complex: Drinking lots of water and gargling. That\u2019s the recommendation from a viral image of a mannequin-like head and neck with these words:\n\n\"Corona virus before it reaches the lungs it remains in the throat for four days and at this time the person begins to cough and have throat pains. If he drinks water a lot and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIt\u2019s false. And it\u2019s part of a growing body of misinformation about coronavirus on social media.\n\n\"While staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent the coronavirus,\" the World Health Organization warns.\n\nGargling won\u2019t do the trick, either (even if gargling with salt water can ease a sore throat).\n\n\"No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared about the coronavirus disease.\n\nSimilarly, the World Health Organization states \"there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\"\n\nAmong the tips the WHO offers to contain the spread of the virus:\n\u2022 Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.\n\u2022 Stay at least 3 feet away from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n\nHealth experts say no coronavirus remedy has yet emerged. So drinking lots of water, or gargling with warm water and salt or vinegar, won\u2019t eliminate it.", "lang": "en"}
