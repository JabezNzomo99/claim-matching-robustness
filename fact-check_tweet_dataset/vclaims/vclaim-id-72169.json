Jim Webb recently announced he\u2019s considering a 2016 presidential run and placed economic fairness high on his agenda.\n\nIn his video , Webb urged people to travel to inner cities to view the \"poverty, crime and lack of opportunity that still affects so many African Americans.\"\n\n\"Or travel to the Appalachian mountains, where my own ancestors settled and whose cultural values I still share, and view the poorest counties in America -- who happen to be more than 90 percent white, and who live in the reality that \u2018if you\u2019re poor and white, you\u2019re out of sight,\u2019\" Webb said.\n\nAre the poorest counties in the U.S. located in Appalachia and more than 90 percent white?\n\nWe asked Webb for proof. Amy Hogan, Webb\u2019s daughter and occasional spokesperson, sent us links to the WikiPedia pages for , Ky. and , Ky. -- two Appalachian counties located in the economically-distressed eastern portion of that state.\n\nBut Hogan didn\u2019t point to any information that indicates those counties are the poorest in the U.S., although the Clay County WikiPedia page says its per capita income and median household income make it one of the poorest counties in the country.\n\nSo we set out on our own search for the poorest counties, relying on data by the U.S. Census Bureau measuring the average yearly wealth from 2008-2012. As our colleagues at PolitiFact National noted in a July story, there are several ways to gauge the poorest counties. We compiled Bottom 10 lists based on three criteria.\n\nSix of these counties are in Appalachia, according to a listing by the congressionally-funded Appalachian Regional Commission -- the five in Kentucky and Hancock County, Tenn. All six have populations that are more than 90 percent white. The two counties in Mississippi are about 85 percent black and the two in Texas are more than 77 percent Hispanic and Latino.\n\nHighest percentage of people below the poverty line:\n\u2022 \u201cIf you look at the average teacher pay compared to the average pay of your citizens, Virginia ranks last.\u201d\n\nThe only Appalachian county on that list is Wolfe County, Ky., which is 90 percent white. Hudspeth County, Texas is 78 percent Hispanic and Latino. Of the other eight counties, the ones in North and South Dakota are mostly Native American and the ones in Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi are at least two-thirds black.\n\nThere\u2019s one Appalachian locality on this list: McCreary County, Ky., which is 90 percent white. Hancock County, Ga. is 60 percent white.The counties in Mississippi are about 85 percent black, the ones in South Dakota are about 90 percent Native American, and those in Texas are at least 87 percent Hispanic and Latino.\n\nIn sharing these lists, we don\u2019t mean to downplay the very real existence of poverty in Appalachian counties that span 13 states, including Virginia. The Appalachian Regional Commission says there are 311 U.S. counties that are economically distressed based on measurements of unemployment, poverty and per capita market income. About 10 percent of all U.S. counties fall into this category.\n\nNinety of the 420 counties in Appalachia are economically distressed. In other words, 21 percent of the counties in the region fall into the category -- more than twice the national average.\n\nLouis Segesvary, a spokesman for the commission, told us the major issue facing these Appalachian communities are their geographic isolation in the mountain range.\n\nWebb said that the poorest U.S. counties are in Appalachia and \"happen to be more than 90 percent white.\"\n\nNo doubt, some of the poorest are in Appalachia, particularly eastern Kentucky. But looking at several different measures of county poverty results in a more complex picture than Webb suggests.\n\nMeasured by median household income, overwhelmingly white Appalachian counties comprise six of the 10 U.S. counties with the lowest median household income. But measured by the poverty rate, only one mostly-white Appalachian county ranks in the 10 poorest. The other nine -- in the South, the Dakotas or Texas -- have larger majorities that are either black, Native American, or Hispanic and Latino. That pattern pretty much holds up when you rank the poorest counties by lowest per capita income.\n\nSo Webb\u2019s statement is partially accurate, but needs context.
