The posts were shared alongside a claim that the kangaroos were rejoicing after rain fell during bushfires in Australia. The photo has been shared in a misleading context; the image was actually taken in 2014 by a nature photographer in Australia who told AFP it was unrelated to the recent bushfires.\n\nThe photo was published by a Facebook page with more than 560,000 followers here on January 6, 2020.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 7,000 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201dThank God , it's raining in Australia #wedontdeservethisplanet\u201d.\n\nAt least 25 people have been killed and more than 1,800 homes destroyed after deadly bushfires scorched millions of hectares of land in Australia, as reported here by AFP on January 7, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe photo was also shared thousands of times alongside a similar claim here on Facebook and here, here, here and here on Twitter; by India-based Facebook users here, here, here and here; and with an identical claim in Sinhala here and here.\n\nThe photo has been circulated in a misleading context; it was taken in 2014 by a nature photographer in Australia.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the same photo published here on the website of photographer Charles Davis, who is based in New South Wales, Australia.\n\nThe photograph is captioned: \u201cPraise to the Rain\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the one published on Davis\u2019 website (R):\n\nDavis told AFP in an email dated January 8: \u201cThat photo was taken almost 7 years ago. It is my photo, It has nothing to do with the fires and it is not raining very much at all here.\n\n\u201cThe kangaroos in that photo are likely all ash now as the fires have gone through that area. I don\u2019t know who started using that photo but it has been used completely out of context.\u201d\n\nHe later issued a clarification in this Instagram post on January 14, which states in part:\n\n\"I took this photo in 2014. These kangaroos are more than likely ash now and definitely aren\u2019t celebrating anything.\"\n\nRain did fall in parts of the bushfire-stricken states of New South Wales and Victoria around January 6 when the misleading posts were shared, but experts said it was not enough to extinguish the fires, ABC Australia reported here on January 7.\n\nIndian news site LatestLY also debunked the misleading claim about the kangaroo image in this report published on January 6, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
