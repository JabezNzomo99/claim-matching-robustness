Let\u2019s check the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of people participating in a \u2018Chariot pulling\u2019 festival in Kalabari district (Karnataka) despite the current lockdown in the country. Fact: The image is old and is that of a \u2018Chariot pulling\u2019 event in Koppal district (Karnataka). It was found to exist on the internet at least since 2017. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen screenshots of the video were subjected to reverse image, an article of \u2018Deccan Herald\u2019 was obtained in the search results. The article was published on 09 January 2017 and the image had the following description \u2013 \u2018POPULAR Gavisiddeshwara Rathotsava in progress\u2019. \u2018Gavisiddeshwara Jathre\u2019 is a religious procession at Gavimath in Koppal district (Karnataka). As part of that festival, a \u2018Rathotsava\u2019 is held wherein people pull a chariot and carry out a procession. So, the image is old and related to a \u2018Chariot pulling\u2019 festival in Koppal district (Karnataka). Also, there is no Kalabari district in Karnataka. \n\n\n\nHowever, it was found from an \u2018ANI\u2019 tweet that a similar event was carried out in Kalburgi district of Karnataka on \u201816 April 2020\u2019; wherein people in large numbers have participated in a religious festival despite the existing lockdown to contain COVID-19 transmission. More details about this event can be read here.\n\nTo summarize, an old unrelated image shared as \u2018People in Kalabari district participated in Chariot pulling festival despite the current lockdown\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
