But the images have been taken out of context: they actually show the recent launch of a bigger project aimed at bringing clean water and sanitation to a region in northern Malawi.\n\nThe meme shows two pictures: in the first, President Mutharika is cutting a ceremonial ribbon tied to a tap, and the second shows him with his hands clasped while an open tap fills a transparent bucket.\n\nIn one misleading Facebook post archived by AFP Fact Check, the meme is captioned: \u201cPresident Peter Mutharika's official commissioning of a Water tap in Mzimba\u201d.\n\nCommenters on the post poked fun at the idea of a ceremony being held for a single tap.\n\nThe Mzimba Integrated Urban Water and Sanitation Project was launched on March 5, according to a post on the Malawian government\u2019s Facebook page from the same day. The post included a series of photos credited to Lisa Kadango of the Malawi News Agency.\n\nThe Mzimba project, costing a total 16.7 billion Malawian Kwacha (US$22.85 million), was approved in 2015 and financed by the Opec Fund for International Development (OFID), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and Malawi's government.\n\nAccording to this report on the project uploaded to the AfDB's website, the new sanitation infrastructure is intended to provide clean water for between 31,000 and 48,000 people. It includes new water facilities in schools and market places.\n\nThe photos posted on the Malawi government's Facebook page also show that Mutharika inaugurated more than a single tap on the day of the ceremony.\n\nHere he is unveiling a plaque commemorating the launch:\n\nAs well as cutting a ribbon next to a gazebo which reads \u201cpotable water for all\u201d.\n\nAccording to the charity WaterAid, one in three Malawians still don't have access to clean water.\n\nIn 2018 AFP reported on a cholera outbreak which affected hundreds of people, killing nine, as a result of unsafe water in the country.\n\nMalawi's Vice President Saulos Chilima and former president Joyce Banda are both challenging Mutharika for the presidency as the country gears up for national elections on May 21.", "lang": "en"}
