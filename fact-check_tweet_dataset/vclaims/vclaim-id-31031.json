Let\u2019s try to check the veracity of that image.\n\n\n\nFact: The image was taken when Modi was conferred with UAE\u2019s highest civilian award \u2018Order of Zayed\u2019. The press coverage of this event shows Prince wearing a plain \u2018white\u2019 headscarf. So, the image is a photoshopped one. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, search results were obtained about UAE Crown Prince conferring Modi with the country\u2019s highest civilian award \u2018Order of Zayed\u2019. The original image of the one posted on Facebook was found in the article of a UAE newspaper \u2018National\u2019 that reported about the event.\n\nWhen referred to the \u2018ANI\u2019 coverage of this event, it can be clearly seen that UAE Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahya was wearing a plain \u2018white\u2019 headscarf during the event. So, the image of UAE Crown Prince wearing a headscarf with \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019 printed on it is a photoshopped one.\n\nTo conclude, UAE Crown Prince wasn\u2019t wearing a headscarf with \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019 printed on it when Modi met him. It is a photoshopped image.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
