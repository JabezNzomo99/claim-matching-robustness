Experts say it\u2019s \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d even \u201ca minute amount\u201d would reach Earth\u2019s surface.\n\n\n\nA persisting conspiracy theory of \u201cbio-warfare against the world\u2019s citizenry\u201d has been shared thousands of times on Facebook this month. And while some users on the social media site rightfully flagged it as potentially false, others continued to spread and treat it as fact.\n\nThe story \u2014 headlined \u201cNASA ADMITS To Spraying Americans With Lithium & Other Chemicals\u201d \u2014 claims that \u201cNASA is spraying lithium, a pharmaceutical drug most often used to treat people with manic depression or bi-polar disorder, into our ionosphere.\u201d It was posted on asheepnomore.net and has been published on other websites since at least 2016.\n\nBut the chemtrail-like theory is a gross misrepresentation of NASA\u2019s actual work.\n\nIt\u2019s true that NASA does occasionally use lithium and other chemicals in the upper atmosphere, but not in the way the false stories described.\n\nThe agency\u2019s Sounding Rockets Program, which uses rockets to carry scientific instruments into the air, deploys the chemicals as \u201cvapor tracers\u201d to observe \u201cmovements of the upper atmosphere or the ionosphere.\u201d The ionosphere, above the ozone layer, begins nearly 50 miles above the Earth. By contrast, cruising altitude for commercial flights is typically about 7 miles.\n\n\u201cThese vapors when they\u2019re released are very small \u2014 they ionize and you end up with these huge clouds,\u201d explains Keith Koehler, a spokesman at NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, which oversees the program. \u201cThey quickly dissipate.\u201d\n\nThe tests can help scientists understand activity in the ionosphere, through which satellite signals travel, and understand solar winds, Koehler told FactCheck.org. NASA points out that the vapor tracers aren\u2019t harmful and are the same chemicals used in fireworks. \u201cA typical Fourth of July fireworks display releases many times that amount and is much closer to the ground,\u201d according to the agency, which says the tracers typically release about a pound of material.\n\nOf the roughly 25 sounding rockets launched each year, Koehler said, usually one or two release the tracers.\n\nThomas P. Ackerman, director of the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean at the University of Washington, told us the conspiracy theory is nonsensical.\n\nThe idea of spraying people with a material from the ionosphere \u2014 given its distance and conditions \u2014 wouldn\u2019t work. He said it\u2019s \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d for chemicals dispersed at that height to reach Earth\u2019s surface because of how they interact in the atmosphere.\n\nThe ionosphere, he said, \u201cis a hostile environment in terms of the material you put there being struck by these high-energy particles in the solar spectrum.\u201d And the atmosphere\u2019s movement would spread the material across the globe, diluting it and rendering it ineffective.\n\n\u201cIf you want to spray a crop with pesticide \u2026 they fly right on top of the crop,\u201d he said. \u201cOn any rationale thought process, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nPlus, Koehler noted in a follow-up email that \u201cthe amount of metallic materials used in the vapor tracer studies is extremely small compared to the amount of material that enters the Earth\u2019s atmosphere daily from meteors.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if a minute amount from a vapor tracer were to reach the ground it would be extremely negligible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe false story accurately states that lithium \u2014 an element found in Earth\u2019s crust with many uses, including to make batteries \u2014 is used to treat people with illnesses such as bipolar disorder (more specifically, the carbonate salt of lithium is used in such treatment). But the story then goes on to claim that \u201cthe power structure\u201d aspires to \u201calter our neurochemistry.\u201d\n\nThe falsehoods don\u2019t stop there: The article cites a study in The New England Journal of Medicine that tested \u201caerosolized vaccines\u201d against measles, but that treatment was administered to children through a face mask \u2014 not by some mass air operation, as the story implies.\n\nAttempts to reach the listed author of the dubious story were unsuccessful.\n\nThe claims about NASA are related to what\u2019s known as the chemtrails theory, a debunked belief that the condensation trails left behind in the sky by airplanes are actually chemical releases by the government.\n\nPublic Policy Polling in a 2013 survey found that 5 percent of American voters believed the chemtrails theory. Three years later, another study found that about 10 percent of Americans deemed the theory \u201ccompletely\u201d true.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nAckerman, Thomas P.
