As of this writing, it is still posted to Ivanka Trump\u2019s timeline.\n\nThe tweet prompted criticism from renowned chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who posted his own tweet pointing out his view that while Goya foods specializes in Hispanic foods and seasonings, the Trump administration\u2019s policies toward the Latino community have been harmful:\n\nThe tweet from President Trump\u2019s eldest daughter and adviser reflects a recent controversy over the brand Goya that was sparked by a July 9, 2020, appearance by Goya CEO Robert Unanue at the White House, where Unanue praised President Trump. This resulted in a call by the president\u2019s critics to boycott the brand, and an inevitable push by his supporters to buy the brand.", "lang": "en"}
