The cabinet had also approved an estimated budget of Rs 1.33 crore for the festival.\n\nThe post is viral on Facebook and has also been massively shared on Twitter.\n\nThe image on top was clicked two years ago in Bangladesh and shows a Rohingya refugee girl who fled from Myanmar on September 6, 2017.\n\nA comparison of the facial features of this girl and the one in Ayodhya evidently proves that the two are different people. They have distinct features \u2013 eye colour, nose, lips.\n\nFurthermore, the image of the impoverished girl in Ayodhya appeared on the internet on October 29.\n\nThere\u2019s also a video of the girl collecting oil from the lamps. The misinformation was earlier debunked by Boomlive.\n\nWhile this girl\u2019s identity could not be established, it is certain that she is not the Rohingya refugee girl whose photograph was shot in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
