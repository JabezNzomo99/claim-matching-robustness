This increase, of 71 deaths, was the same as the official Grenfell Tower death toll.\n\nFewer people are dying in fires in general but recent figures have fluctuated\n\nThe year just gone had the highest number of deaths since 2010/11, when there were 335 fire-related fatalities.\n\nAlthough the Home Office refers to 71 fatalities of the Grenfell Tower fire, it\u2019s widely acknowledged that there was a 72nd victim\u2014Maria del Pilar Burton\u2014who was rescued from the tower and died seven months later. Grahame Morris MP acknowledged this in a later tweet.\n\nLooking at the number of fatalities per million people of the population, there have been 5 or 6 a year since 2010/11. That\u2019s down from a high of 16 per million in 1981/82 when this data set began.\n\nThe majority of fire-related deaths in 2016/17 (80%) occurred because of fires in single occupancy dwellings. This includes houses, flats and maisonettes occupied by, for example, a family or a couple, but not those shared by three or more occupants who aren\u2019t related or in relationships. Road vehicle fires caused 8% of fatalities.\n\nThere were around 7,300 non-fatal casualties as a result of fires in England in 2017/18. That number is down generally from a peak in 1996/97 when there were 14,800.\n\nBut the Home Office says \u201cit appears that the downward trend has slowed in the last few years and shows some fluctuation.\u201d\n\nAlmost half of these casualties last year required hospital treatment, a third needed first aid, and less than a quarter had a \u201cprecautionary check\u201d.\n\nWhere were most fires?\n\nFires are categorised as larger primary fires, which are usually in homes or cars and involve casualties, less serious secondary fires, and chimney fires.\n\nTo qualify as a primary fire, it has to involve fatalities, casualties, rescues, or five or more pumps in attendance. Fires in buildings, vehicles or outdoor structures that aren\u2019t derelict also count.\n\nPrimary fires can happen in dwellings, which includes houses and flats, while the other buildings category covers places like hotels, student halls, offices and shops.\n\nThe number of primary fires has dropped by 60% since a peak in 2001/02 when there were 189,000. In 2017/18 there were 74,100. Primary fires in homes are down by over 40% over the same period, from 54,500 to 30,700.\n\nThe total number of incidents attended by fire and rescue services in England is down by around 15% since 2009/10 (when comparable records began), from 680,600 to 564,800 in 2017/18.\n\nJust 30% of the incidents fire and rescue services attended in 2017/18 were actual fires.\n\nIn 2017/18 firefighters attended more non-fire incidents than fires, having done so for the first time on record the year before. Non-fire incidents can include extracting people from cars after collisions, evacuating during floods, and being the first responder in medical emergencies.\n\nFire and rescue services attended almost 40% more non-fire incidents in 2017/18 than they did three years earlier. The Home Office said that was \u201cmainly due to an increase in [Fire and Rescue Services] attending medical co-responding incidents\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
