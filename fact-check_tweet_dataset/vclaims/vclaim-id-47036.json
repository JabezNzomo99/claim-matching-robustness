In the roughly five-minute speech, he described his sibling\u2019s death as one in a series of senseless killings of Black men by American cops and asked the committee to \u201cstop the pain\u201d for families like his.\n\n\u201cPeople of all backgrounds, genders and races have come together to demand change \u2014 honor them, honor George, and make the necessary changes that make law enforcement the solution and not the problem,\u201d he testified. \u201cThe people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough.\u201d\n\nHours after the testimony, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is not a member of the committee, tweeted the below-displayed post to publicize his participation in the hearing and to apparently show her followers that she supported him.\n\nThe tweet quickly drew criticism online among supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, veterans, and their families who alleged the tweet and its photos showed Pelosi inappropriately giving a folded American flag in a presentation case to Philonise Floyd; they claimed such a gesture was reserved only for the relatives of members of the U.S. Armed Forces or police officers after they die. \u201cWhat a slap in the face to service members,\u201d one person tweeted.\n\nPeggy Hubbard, who is a retired Navy veteran, former police officer, and Republican candidate in Illinois\u2019 2020 Senate race, added to the criticism with a viral Facebook video in which she made vague references to a group of people who have disrespected the flag (presumably during protests against police brutality in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death) and claimed Democrats had committed an offense by giving Philonise Floyd a folded American flag that is \u201cpreserved for veterans.\u201d She said:\n\nThat video and other posts on the matter included references to George Floyd\u2019s past arrests and incarcerations as part of what appeared to be an effort to deny him martyrdom and criticize the House speaker and other Democratic leaders\u2019 connection to the Floyd family. (Here\u2019s a detailed investigation into George Floyd\u2019s criminal history and psychologists\u2019 explanation for why people often draw attention to the arrest records of Black men who die in police custody.)\n\n\n\nReaders asked Snopes to investigate the claim about the folded flag \u2014 many of whom asked whether the photograph with Pelosi was \u201creal\u201d or digitally manipulated in any way \u2014 and we found the assertion contains some truth and some falsehood.\n\nFirstly, we considered procedures by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which gifts American flags during funeral services to the relatives of the deceased who fit the below-displayed categories (as outlined on the VA\u2019s website) and who make the request.\n\nFloyd did not qualify for such a ceremony. He was born in North Carolina, spent most of his life in Houston, and died in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. At no point did he serve in the U.S. military, which includes the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Air National Guard.\n\nNext, to get to the bottom of the claim, we considered two key questions: Did Pelosi indeed present a folded American flag to a relative of George Floyd like her tweet suggests? And, if so, did she break U.S. Flag Code, which is a set of federal advisories for how people should display and care for the American flag?\n\nFor the former, we analyzed the account from where the tweet originated. With more than 4.8 million followers, it is the verified account for which Pelosi promotes her public appearances, media interviews, and political agenda, and it is linked with her official website as U.S. House speaker.\n\nThe tweet on June 10, 2020, was posted roughly one hour after Pelosi called for the removal of 11 statutes representing Confederate leaders and about 30 minutes before the Twitter account circulated an interview Pelosi gave to CNN. And in that footage, Pelosi is wearing what appeared to be the same outfit (a blue shirt, off-white blazer with a lapel gold pin, and blue mask) she wore when photographed giving the alleged folded American flag to Philonise Floyd.\n\nIn a call to Snopes on June 17, 2020, Pelosi\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hammill confirmed the account that tweeted the photo was the House Speaker\u2019s official Twitter channel and, yes, she had given Philonise Floyd a folded American flag on June 10, 2020, after his testimony in front of the House committee that day.\n\nTo explore whether Pelosi had broken federal guidelines for how to handle the flag, we reviewed Title 4 and Title 36 of U.S. Code, which designates \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d as the national anthem and advises how Americans should treat the flag. Among other things, the statutes state: \u201cNo disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s key in the analysis: No language in the federal statutes prohibits government officials \u2014 or anyone \u2014 from presenting a folded flag to any American for any reason. Also, the statutes do not prescribe symbolic meaning to the 13 steps people traditionally use to fold a flag into a triangle, like the one Philonise Floyd received. (Read more about that misconception here.)\n\nJohn Raughter, the deputy director of communications for the American Legion, summed up the matter in an email to Snopes. He said while the folded flag has come to represent a veteran funeral rite, the federal advisories do not say who can, or cannot, receive one as a gift, nor under what cases the flag should be folded into a triangle and stored in a display case. Raughter said in an email:\n\nTo that point, anyone can buy a display case for an American flag via Amazon or other retailers, and Pelosi and other members of Congress allow constituents to purchase American flags via their offices, including flags that have flown over the Capitol. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC), which is the federal agency in charge of maintaining the Capitol building, oversees that federal flag-buying system, fulfilling an average of more than 100,000 flag requests from House and Senate offices annually, per the AOC\u2019s website.\n\nHammill said the allegation that Pelosi had broken some sort of federal guideline governing the use of the American flag is \u201ccompletely false\u201d and \u201cflag code is completely consistent\u201d with the House Speaker\u2019s actions. He added:\n\nAlso, while evaluating Pelosi\u2019s alleged actions, this is important: Anyone who does break the U.S. Flag Code and gets caught won\u2019t face fines or jail time because the Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment\u2019s right to free speech covers any politically motivated violations of the statutes. In other words, if the code did indeed prohibit Pelosi from presenting a folded flag to George Floyd\u2019s family, like the above-mentioned claims falsely assert, she could not face any penalties legally. The AARP states on its website:\n\nIn sum, given the photographic evidence of Pelosi giving Philonise Floyd a folded American flag and her official Twitter promoting those images \u2014 and the fact that the flag-giving ceremony is not reserved only for the relatives of veterans; members of Congress routinely provide constituents flags that have been flown over the Capitol \u2014 we rate this claim a \u201cMixture\u201d of truth and falsehood.", "lang": "en"}
