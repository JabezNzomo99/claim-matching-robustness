Mount Kenya is the second highest mountain in Africa and a UNESCO World heritage site.\n\nA comparison of the image available on Google and the ones tweeted by @IndiainKenya shows that the cloud pattern behind the range is the exactly the same as that in the Google image.\n\nMoreover the first two images have been further manipulated to add trees and houses in the valley.\n\nTwitter users were quick to point out the gaffe.\n\nAfter being called out by Twitter users, the High Commission tweeted an apology and said that the image was sent by a community member.\n\nIn connection to the 4th International Yoga Day on June 21, 2018, Indian missions are tweeting photos of yoga sessions organized in respective countries. The United Nations proclaimed June 21 as International Day of Yoga in December 2014 with an aim to promote awareness of the benefits of practicing yoga. The theme for 2018 celebration is 'Yoga for Peace'.", "lang": "en"}
