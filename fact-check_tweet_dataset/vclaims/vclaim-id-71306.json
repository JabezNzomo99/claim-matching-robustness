Along with the post, the picture of a vaccine has also been posted. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is misleading.\n\nThe post shared on Facebook by a user named Hammad Chaudry reads: \n\n\u201cJust in case you are wondering how much the media controls people, America has been vaccinating cattle for coronavirus for years, yet the news tells you it\u2019s new and gunna kill you all so go buy mask\u2026.\u201d The post also shows a picture of vaccine named \n\nScourguard-4K Vaccine. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by breaking down various elements of the viral claim.\n\nThe viral post claims that media controls people and the news tells that coronavirus is new, go buy the mask.\n\nVishvas News investigated and found that Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments.\n\nCOVID-19 was unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.\n\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus is a new strain in the coronavirus family. As per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. The seven coronaviruses that can infect people are:\n\n229E (alpha coronavirus)\n\nNL63 (alpha coronavirus)\n\nOC43 (beta coronavirus)\n\nHKU1 (beta coronavirus)\n\nMERS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS)\n\nSARS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS)\n\n2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\n\nThe post is accompanied by a picture of a vaccine named Scourguard-4K. When we investigated we found that the manufacturer of the vaccine is Zoetis.\n\nOn the website of Zoetis, we found the description of the vaccine. \u201cScourGuard 4K is for vaccination of healthy, pregnant cows and heifers as an aid in preventing diarrhea in their calves caused by bovine rotavirus (serotypes G6 and G10), bovine coronavirus, and enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli having the K99 pili adherence factor.\u201d\n\nIn the precautions of the vaccine, it has been mentioned that \u2018this product has been shown to be efficacious in healthy animals.\u2019 There is no mention of the use of this medicine in humans.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Nikhil Modi, a Pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. He said, \u201cThe coronavirus used in the Bovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine is distinct from the current coronavirus. This is not a cure for COVID-19. Bovine means affecting cattle. This medicine is not meant for humans.\u201d\n\nWe scanned the profile of the user who shared the viral post. The user named Hammad Chaudry hails out of Lahore, Pakistan as his post suggests.\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic and its consequences are constantly evolving and data that was accurate weeks or even days ago might have changed. Remember to check the date when the fact-check you are reading was published before sharing it.\n\nConclusion: The viral post claims that the world has been using coronavirus vaccine on cattle for years and the current panic on novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been overblown by media. When we investigated, we found that the vaccine being referred is for cattle, it is neither related with humans, not with COVID-19. The viral post is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
