That, to me, is the most racist concept you can come up with,\u201d Biden said in a 1975 interview with a Newark, Del., publication known as the People Paper that was entered into the congressional record. \u201cWhat it says is, \u2018In order for your child with curly black hair, brown eyes, and dark skin to be able to learn anything, he needs to sit next to my blond-haired, blue-eyed son.\u2019 That\u2019s racist!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I did it, I knew I was going to take a political hit. And the people around me said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, because you are going to pay a price for this in terms of whatever future you want in politics.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Look, I\u2019m prepared to play the bad guy on this. I do not intend to put any parent in jail.\u2019 And no parent went to jail. But the school district, society, this community, everyone, including our business community, others, have got to take seriously the education of these children and give the parents the resources that they deserve and need. And that\u2019s what ended up happening. We improved attendance by over 30 percent and not a parent went to jail.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
