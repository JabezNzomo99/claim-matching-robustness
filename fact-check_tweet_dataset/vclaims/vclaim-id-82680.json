The photoshopped image draws a parallel to a still from the Hindi movie \u2018Oh My God\u2019, a film critical of blind superstition and religious charlatans. The film also starred actors Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal. BOOM had earlier debunked the image on May 30, 2018 when Jignesh Mevani had tweeted it.", "lang": "en"}
