Most of these sites are Sinhalese websites.\n\nClick here for the post.\n\nThe same photos were uploaded on two Sinhalese YouTube channels - ES Productions and 'Nodutu Lowa wata' with a voice over about \"pain of a father.\"\n\nBoth uploads are from May 2018 and predate the attacks in Sri Lank which took place on April 21, 2019. BOOM was not able to independently verify the identity of the girl or the cause of her death.\n\nSerial bombings carried out at churches and hotels on Easter Sunday by Islamic militants killed hundreds in the worst terrorist attack the island nation has seen. Sri Lanka said Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath carried out the attacks. Earlier this week terror group Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks.", "lang": "en"}
