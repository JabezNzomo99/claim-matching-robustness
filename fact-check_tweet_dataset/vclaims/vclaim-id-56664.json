Just look at his condition'.\n\nThe word 'peaceful' is used as a sarcastic reference for Muslims in India on social media. \n\n\n\nWatch the video below and check its archived version here.\n\nAlso read No, 'Pakistan Zindabad' Was Not Chanted In Mumbai\n\nThe video has also been shared on multiple Facebook pages with a caption mocking the Muslim community. The caption reads 'Hahaha Miyaji (Muslim guy) mistook the thermal scanning machine for a cop's pistol'.\n\nThe same video was tweeted by Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, on May 14 with the same Hindi caption (as the Facebook post) .

We found the seven-minute long original video uploaded on YouTube on May 11 this year.\n\nThe video has been uploaded on YouTube channel Bahaliyake TV with a description in Swahili which translates to 'Bahali yake refused to be tested, in the end they forced him to take the test'.\n\nBOOM also contacted Africa Check, which confirmed that the video is indeed staged and not real. Africa Check confirmed that the man in the video is a Kenyan comedian who goes by the stage name of 'Bahali Yake Mwenyewe'. \n\n\n\nIn the video he plays the role of a clueless villager and has dressed up as a person from the Somali community. The video was created as a public awareness message about mass testing for COVID-19, the importance of wearing masks, sanitizing and maintaining social distancing. \n\n\n\nBOOM also tracked Bahali yake's Facebook page and found his real name is Hussein Yussuf. The page describes him as 'An actor/comedian and a director who traces his roots from the great county of Isiolo. Big dream and ambition is to fly Isiolo County's flag higher'.\n\nThe actor had shared the YouTube link to the video on his Facebook page on May 11.\n\nWe also found an article published in Kenyan news and entertainment website TUKO featuring Bahali yake in February 2018. TUKO's official Twitter handle had also tweeted the link to the article.\n\n\n\nAlso read Video Of Robbery Shared As Migrants Attacking For Money In Delhi", "lang": "en"}
