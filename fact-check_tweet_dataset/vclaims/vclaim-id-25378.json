While the photo does show an Australian lawmaker, she\u2019s not the prime minister -- she\u2019s Larissa Waters, a member of the country\u2019s Senate.\n\nThe picture was posted by the Facebook page Ogun State on April 21 and has since been shared more than 12,000 times. We\u2019ve archived the post here.\n\n\u201cAustralian Prime Minister breastfeeding her baby while delivering a speech at the Parliament. ??good mothers can do anything for their babies,\u201d the caption reads.\n\nAustralia has only had male prime ministers since June 2013. The current prime minister, in office since August 2018, is Scott Morrison. Australia\u2019s last female prime minister -- and only female leader to date -- was Julia Gillard, who was in office from June 2010 until June 2013.\n\nAs for the woman pictured in the Facebook post, a Google reverse image search identifies her as Larissa Waters, a senator with the Australian Greens. In June 2017, Waters breastfed her 14-week-old baby in parliament while moving a motion on black lung disease, a condition affecting coal miners in the country.\n\nHere is a video of Waters moving the motion while breastfeeding.\n\nWaters had made history the previous month by becoming the first woman to breastfeed a child in the Australian parliament, as reported here in the New York Times.\n\nWaters received a wave of support around the world from mothers, who are often still publicly shamed for breastfeeding in public.\n\nShe is not the only female lawmaker to have breast-fed a baby in parliament. As reported by AFP, Icelandic MP Unnur Bra Konradsdottir made similar headlines in 2016, as did Spanish MP Carolina Bescansa.", "lang": "en"}
