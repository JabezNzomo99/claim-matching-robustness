Some examples include \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093f' (caste) as '\u091c\u093e\u0924\u0940', '\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f (health) as '\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0925' and '\u0914\u0930 \u091c\u0932\u094d\u0926' (and soon) which are two separate words has been written as one '\u0914\u0930\u091c\u0932\u094d\u0926'.\n\nWe also did not find any such tweet on Shah's timeline. His most recent tweet about a meeting with Director Generals of all Central Armed Police Force on May 8, 2020.\n\nAlong with PM Narendra Modi, Shah was also present in a meeting of the NDMA to review the situation in Vishakhapatnam after the gas leak in the city.", "lang": "en"}
