NAPO is a law enforcement union founded in 1978 and described as representing 241,000 officers from more than 1,000 police organizations.\n\nThe letter, dated 4 September, read as follows:\n\nOn behalf of the more than 241,000 law enforcement officers represented by our Association across the country, I write to you to condemn in the strongest possible terms your selection of Colin Kaepernick for Nike\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d ad campaign. Mr. Kaepernick is known, not as a successful athlete, but as a shallow dilettante seeking to gain notoriety by disrespecting the flag for which so many Americans have fought and died \u2026 In featuring Mr. Kaepernick in the \u201cJust Do It\u201d campaign, Nike grossly insults the men and women who really do make sacrifices for the sake of our nation. We are calling on all our member officers, their families and friends to join in boycotting all Nike products.\n\nNAPO was joined in critizing Nike and Kaepernick by the National Fraternal Order of Police, whose president, Chuck Canterbury, issued a press release addressing (but not calling for) a boycott of Nike:\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police has been called upon to boycott Nike for capitalizing on this former professional football player because he attracts controversy. In our experience, boycotts and similar exercises do not succeed and often serve only to enrich the company \u2014 which is not what we want to do. Our members and, for that matter, any American citizen understands when the law enforcement profession is being insulted \u2014 we have no doubt they will make their purchases with that insult in mind.\n\nThese vehement criticisms sparked something of a controversy among police unions, with the National Black Police Association (NBPA) issuing a strong rejection of McHale\u2019s letter. On 5 September, NBPA chairperson Sonia Y.W. Pruitt wrote a letter of her own to Nike\u2019s CEO, offering the support of her organization\u2019s members:\n\nThe National Black Police Association is not in agreement with NAPO on this matter, and we strongly condemn their call for police officers and their families to boycott Nike and its products \u2026 NAPO believes that Mr. Kaepernick\u2019s choice to openly protest issues surrounding police brutality, racism and social injustices in this country makes him anti-police. On the contrary, the NBPA believes that Mr. Kaepernick\u2019s stance is in direct alignment with what law enforcement stands for \u2014 the protection of a people, their human rights, their dignity, their safety, and their rights as American citizens \u2026 The NBPA proudly supports Nike and your use of Mr. Kaepernick in you new \u201cJust Do It\u201d advertising campaign\u2026We will likely be buying and wearing Nike products in the near future.", "lang": "en"}
