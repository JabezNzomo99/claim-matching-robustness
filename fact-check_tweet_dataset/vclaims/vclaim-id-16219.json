{"title": "Unemployment is at a 10-year low", "subtitle": "The overall employment rate is at its highest on record (since 1970).

It\u2019s also at record levels counting people up to state pension age.\n\nAnd it\u2019s correct that the unemployment rate is the lowest it\u2019s been for over ten years. That means fewer people have been looking for a job in the past month, or are waiting to start one in the next two weeks, than at any point since 2005.\n\nBut it can\u2019t possibly be correct that:\n\nThere are only about 78,000 people living in the Aldridge-Brownhills constituency, according to latest estimates.\n\nAround 39,000 people were employed from July 2015 to June 2016. That\u2019s about 4,500 more than the previous year. It\u2019s not clear whether this is statistically significant.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure where Mrs May found her claim for the size of the increase. The ONS told us this is the most recent published data for employment by constituency.", "lang": "en"}
