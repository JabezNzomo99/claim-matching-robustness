No, that's not true: First, sex education classes in California public schools are not mandatory, because parents can opt their children out of the program under state law. Second, the book that is purportedly used to teach middle-school students about those sex practices was on a proposed list of suggested books - but it was banned from the curriculum before the program was adopted.\n\nThe false claim originated from an article published by NationalFile.com on January 11, 2020, titled \"REPORT: California 8th Graders Taught Anal, Bondage, Sex Involving Blood in Sex-Ed Class\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe NationalFile.com claim is based on a post by the Facebook group Informed Parents of Washington:\n\nThis post accurately noted that the book was banned by California:\n\nBut the post included a screenshot of another post that featured a photo of the book's index:\n\nThat post incorrectly claimed the book was being used, and that the class was mandatory:\n\nThe Los Angeles Times explained what happened with the book in a May 10, 2019, story titled Controversial sex education framework for California approved despite protest:\n\nThe guidance has prompted protest among parents, conservative groups and teachers -- most notably around some of the books that were suggested as resources, including \"S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-to-Know Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Your Teens and Twenties,\" which includes descriptions of anal sex and bondage; and \"Changing You,\" which includes cartoon illustrations of female and male genitalia. Both books were recommended for removal.\n\n\n\n\"It's important to know the board is not trying to ban books. We're not saying that the books are bad,\" State Board of Education member Feliza I. Ortiz-Licon said. \"But the removal will help avoid the misunderstanding that California is mandating the use of these books.\"\n\nThe book has not ever been used for any classes in California public schools.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes nationalfile.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
