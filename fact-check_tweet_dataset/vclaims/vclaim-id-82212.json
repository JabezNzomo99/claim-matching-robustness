These prisons, jails and detention centers are used to hold immigrants \u2014 men, women, families with children, people with or without criminal backgrounds \u2013 for hearings before a federal immigration judge. ICE spends nearly $2 billion a year on detention, most of it going to for-profit prisons contracts.\n\nUnder the 2015 DHS Appropriations Act, the Department of Homeland Security is required to \u201cmaintain a level of not less than 34,000 detention beds.\u201d This language was added to the federal budget in 2009 by then-Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.). Since then, Republican members on the House Appropriations Committee largely have defended this requirement, saying it compels ICE to enforce the law.\n\nThis requirement, the \u201cbed quota\u201d or \u201cbed mandate,\u201d is criticized by immigration, human-rights and civil-rights advocates, and many House Democrats. They call it an arbitrary quota that leads to inhumane jailing practices, noting that the majority of the detainees are not violent offenders. Detention should be driven by need, not to meet a quota, they say.\n\nRep. John Culberson (R-Tex.), a member of the House Appropriation Committee who repeatedly has said he wants all 34,000 be filled, questioned Johnson during a March 2014 hearing about the DHS request to cut the bed mandate by 10 percent. Johnson replied: \u201cI would interpret that [the law] to mean that we have to maintain 34,000 detention beds. Some of those beds might be empty at any given time, but we have to maintain 34,000 detention beds.\u201d\n\nThe agency appears to be moving away from the previous interpretation, as Johnson indicated. In April 2015, ICE Director Sarah Saldana answered a similar question from Culberson: \u201cWe\u2019re working to use them [34,000 beds]. Every day, people are out there trying to find [detainees], particularly with respect to persons with criminal records and those that meet our priorities. \u2026 The important thing is to make the right decisions as required by law as to whether we can detain someone or not. The sole purpose and goal is not to fill a bed; it\u2019s to fill it in the right way. That\u2019s my view.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign pointed to several news reports showing the bed mandate was driving the companies\u2019 profits and creating an incentive for two major private prison corporations to expand their immigrant detention business. They also noted an April 2015 report by Grassroots Leadership, which advocates an end to for-profit incarceration, showing the impact of lobbying by the private prison industry on immigration policies.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office found that ICE had inconsistent oversight of its detention facilities. Some privately-run facilities do have guaranteed minimum populations as a part of their contract. So field officers were directed to send detainees there, since ICE pays for the beds regardless of whether they are used, and the per diem cost goes up if the minimum is not met. Some state-level contracts with private prisons also include obligations for the companies to fill beds to 100 percent capacity.\n\nICE agents must detain high-priority migrants \u2014 i.e., those who are a flight risk, have violent criminal records , are repeat offenders \u2014 but have discretion over other, lower-risk categories. The bed mandate was affecting the agency\u2019s ability to efficiently use and expand its alternative program for lower-risk offenders, according to another GAO report. The average cost of the alternative program was $10.55 per day, compared to the average daily cost of detention: $158.\n\nMatthew Kolken, immigration attorney, said the administration\u2019s goal of 400,000 deportations a year adds incentives for detention instead of alternative options for lower-risk offenders: \u201cThe administration can simply let those beds go empty, but it chooses not to. The political spin is that the Obama administration\u2019s hands are tied by Congress, and that is why so many immigrants are being detained, which is simply not reflective of a plain unambiguous reading of the law.\u201d\n\nDHS did, indeed, interpret the mandate as a requirement to fill up detention facilities. After the mandate was added into the budget, the average daily detainee population increased and correlated with number of beds funded. However, the House Appropriations Committee confirmed to The Fact Checker that the law does not require every bed to be filled. Johnson and Saldana said the same to Congress, and the agency appears to be moving away from its original interpretation. The fiscal 2015 daily detainee number hovers at 78 percent of the 34,000 bed quota, so it is clear that not all the beds were used.", "lang": "en"}
