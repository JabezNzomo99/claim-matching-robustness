Fox News\u2019s Megyn Kelly confronted Donna Brazile about an email that was disclosed by WikiLeaks through a hack of the email account of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The email indicated that while Brazile was working for CNN as a commentator, she had given inside dope on one of the questions that Clinton might face during a CNN town hall. (At the time of the email exchange, Brazile was a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, in addition to working for CNN.)\n\nAs can be seen in the quotes above, Brazile adamantly denied that she had received questions in advance, although she seemed to qualify her statements by saying \u201cfrom CNN.\u201d But then it was revealed on Oct. 31 that she had been forced to resign from CNN after another email emerged through WikiLeaks indicating she had provided the Clinton campaign with yet another question.\n\nIt would seem obvious that a debate being held in Flint would include questions on possible solutions, although Clinton took the opportunity to answer Waters\u2019s question by committing to remove lead from water systems across the country within five years. Waters later said Clinton\u2019s answer \u201cmade me vomit in my mouth\u201d because that was too long to wait in Flint.\n\nThe DNC declined to comment on Brazile\u2019s statements, except to point the Fact Checker to a statement issued by Brazile on Oct. 11 that mostly attacked the Russian government (suspected of supplying the Podesta hack to WikiLeaks) and Donald Trump. The statement included this claim: \u201cAs it pertains to the CNN debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that Brazile shared, on at least two occasions, questions that later came up in a CNN town hall and a CNN-hosted primary debate. In one case, she provided the essential text of a question; in another instance, she informed the campaign that Clinton would be asked about solutions to the Flint water crisis.\n\nBrazile, in her interview with Kelly, gave rather slippery answers \u2014 that CNN never gave her questions, that she never got CNN documents. That leaves open the possibility that she got a question from another source. She tries a similar dance in her DNC statement, saying she \u201cnever had access to questions.\u201d\n\nBut also in her DNC statement, Brazile left herself little wiggle room, flatly saying she never shared questions with \u201cthe candidates.\u201d Maybe she did not communicate directly with Clinton, but she clearly shared questions with Clinton\u2019s staff. So that\u2019s too slick by half \u2014 and her statement is false and misleading.", "lang": "en"}
