There is no record of Jill Biden making this statement.\n\nThe posts ( here , here) link to an article on a website called \u2018New York Post\u2019 (but not apparently related to the popular outlet New York Post, nypost.com/ ) titled \u201cDr, Jill Biden: \u2018All Americans Will be Required to Learn Spanish When We Win\u2019 (VIDEO)\u201d (here). A large \u2018watch video\u2019 button takes users to another article on a website called \u201cUS Mags Press\u201d with the same headline (here).\n\nThis article says \u201c[Jill Biden\u2019s] only initiative as First Lady will be to require Americans to learn Spanish.\u201d It also has a video of Jill Biden on \u2018The View\u2019 embedded (here).\n\nNowhere in this interview on The View does Jill Biden mention Spanish.
