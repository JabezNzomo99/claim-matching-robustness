The leader of the United Transformation Movement, Saulos Chilima, recently addressed some concerns about the election but did not mention anything about needing to postpone it.\n\nIn one Facebook post, archived here, the Malawi Institute of Journalism\u2019s radio station posted the false press statement captioned: \u201cUTM Party wants elections postponed??\u201d\n\nThe alleged letter is addressed to the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) and claims \u201cstrong allegations of rigging\u201d have led the party to request a postponement of the election. It is supposedly signed by the party\u2019s publicity secretary Joseph Malunga.\n\nBut UTM Secretary General Patricia Kaliati denied UTM had issued the statement calling for the postponement of the elections.\n\n\"The statement did not come from us,\u201d Kaliati told AFP -- a post retweeted by the official UTM account also reiterates this.\n\nThe false post appeared after an actual press briefing by vice president Saulos Chilima on May 19, where he highlighted a few concerns of alleged rigging ahead of elections in the country this week.\n\nHis concerns included the presence of a Zimbabwean national helping the ruling party to rig elections, the lack of police supervision in a couple of voting areas, near shootouts in other areas and allegations of an organised effort to seed pre-marked ballots using police impersonators.\n\nChilima said the party would send a letter to the MEC ahead of voting day to address the concerns but mentioned nothing of a request to postpone the elections as claimed.\n\nThe MEC chair Jane Ansah was quoted in a series of posts on the Malawi government Facebook page which said the UTM claims were baseless and meant to discourage voters from going to the polls.\n\nChilima was Mutharika's running mate in 2014 and became vice-president -- but he then fell out with his boss.\n\nChilima quit the ruling party last year and set up the UTM to contest the election.\n\nMalawi\u2019s President Peter Mutharika is aiming for a second and final term when Malawi takes to the polls on May 21 -- read this AFP report for more.", "lang": "en"}
