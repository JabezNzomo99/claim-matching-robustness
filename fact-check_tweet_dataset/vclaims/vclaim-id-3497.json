But while fewer people would have to pay it, revenue from estate taxes is expected to be cut by only a third over the next eight years. And then the changes would expire.\n\nTrump\u2019s misleading comment about the estate tax came during remarks at the White House as Republican lawmakers celebrated passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which he signed on Dec. 22.\n\nAs we have written before, the estate tax affects very few farms or small businesses. A study published last year, and updated in March, by the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 38,328 farms would become part of estates in 2016. Of those, only 0.42 percent \u2014 161 estates \u2014 would owe any estate tax at all.\n\nSeparate research by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center puts the number even lower. TPC estimates that only 50 farms and closely held businesses will pay any estate tax in 2017.\n\nBut here, we are focusing on Trump\u2019s claim that the estate tax was \u201cfor the most part \u2026 wiped out.\u201d\n\nUnder previous law, any assets from estates valued at more than $5.49 million (nearly $11 million for couples) will be subject to the estate tax in the 2017 tax year, according to the IRS. The new law doubles the estate tax exemption to $11.2 million ($22.4 million for couples). That provision expires at the end of 2025.\n\nAn analysis by the Tax Policy Center of the estate tax changes proposed in the Senate version of the bill \u2014 which ultimately were adopted in the final bill that became law \u2014 shows that while the number of people who would have to pay an estate tax would drop from 5,500 to 1,700 in 2018, the tax revenues from the estate tax would drop by only about a third, from $20.4 billion to $13.6 billion. That pattern remains \u2014 with estate tax revenue about a third lower than it would be under current law \u2014 over the next eight years, until the provision sunsets.\n\n\u201cMost estate tax is paid by extremely wealthy people, so even doubling the exemption leaves most of it in place,\u201d Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, told us in an email.\n\nIt does, however, eliminate estate tax liability for people with estate assets between about $5.6 million and $11.2 million (or double for couples).\n\nAs we noted earlier, the doubling of the estate tax exemption level expires at the end of 2025. So, unless a future Congress extends it, the estate tax would revert to the previous level \u2014 and would actually be slightly higher because of the substitution of the chained CPI for the current Consumer Price Index formula, Toder said.\n\nIn other words, the changes to the estate tax are \u2014 as written \u2014 temporary. And even in the years when the exemption level has been doubled, the estate taxes paid are expected to drop by about a third third (even as the number of people who will have to pay it is cut by nearly 70 percent). That\u2019s not \u201cwiped out.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
