There is no evidence, however, that it actually occurred.\n\nAt the heart of the lingering story is an October 2016 exchange between \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Steve Doocy and J. Christian Adams, a former voting section attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice. Doocy asked Adams about cases of fraudulent voting, namely votes he said were cast by deceased individuals still on voter rolls.\n\nDuring the interview, Adams said: \u201cNow we have 4 million \u2014 4 million, Steve \u2014 ineligible and dead voters on American voter rolls, according to the Pew Charitable Trust. That\u2019s too many, and it\u2019s going to affect the election.\u201d\n\nWhile Adams raised the issues of voter eligibility and outdated registrations \u2014 and how they could affect the vote tally \u2014 his comments didn\u2019t offer any actual evidence that \u201c4 million illegal votes\u201d were cast in the 2016 election (which, again, hadn\u2019t yet occurred at the time of the interview).\n\nAdams was likely referring to a 2012 study by the Pew Center on the States \u2014 \u201cInaccurate, Costly and Inefficient: Evidence That America\u2019s Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade\u201d \u2014 which found that 1.8 million deceased people were still listed as eligible voters and that 2.75 million people were registered to vote in multiple states.\n\nHowever, the study did not find evidence of actual voter fraud due to those issues, as its primary author, David Becker, has previously noted. Rather, it said voter rolls are \u201csusceptible to fraud\u201d and could create \u201cthe perception that they lack integrity.\u201d\n\nVoting experts have told us previously that fraudulent ballots cast in the name of dead registered voters is mostly a myth and extremely rare.\n\nAfter winning the election, President Donald Trump repeatedly made unsupported claims of voter fraud \u2014 sometimes by misrepresenting what the Pew study said.\n\nIn November 2016, Trump tweeted: \u201cIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\u201d\n\nThe president went on to establish the short-lived Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity \u2014 which was to examine \u201cfraudulent voting,\u201d among other issues. It was dissolved just months after it was created, and there has been no evidence to date of widespread fraud.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cInaccurate, Costly, and Inefficient: Evidence That America\u2019s Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade.\u201d The Pew Center on the States.
