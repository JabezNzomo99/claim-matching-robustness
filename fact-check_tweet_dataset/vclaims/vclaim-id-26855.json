The video caption reads: \"Idhar aap budget me lage the, udhar Chhattisgarh me bharat virodhi bhaasan dene par Congressiyo ki jamkar dhulai ki police valo ne [While you were busy with the budget, Chhattisgarh Congress workers were beaten up by police for delivering anti-national speech]\".\n\nFacebook user Mukesh Soni posted this video in the public group 'Mission Modi 2019 me apne 100 mitro ko jode'. The group has more than 5 lakh followers. Netizens soon started slamming the Congress party believing the video to be true.\n\nIndia Today Fact Check Team found the claim to be false.\n\nThe video was shot in September last year during the protest of Congress workers in Chhatisgarh's Bilaspur. During the protest, Congress workers allegedly threw garbage inside the house of the then urban administration minister Amar Agrawal due to which the police lathi-charged on the Congress workers.\n\nThe video has already been shared more than 1000 times from different Facebook accounts.\n\nWhen we searched the keywords \"Chhattisgarh laathi charge Congress\", we found many media reports which used this video and described the incident. We couldn't find any report which said that the Congress workers delivered anti-national speech during the protest.\n\nThe incident was widely covered by the media. Congress president Rahul Gandhi also criticised the then BJP government in the state terming the incident an act of \"dictatorship\" and an attack on the fundamental rights of the Congress workers.\n\nREAD | After Bilaspur lathicharge, Rahul Gandhi says dictatorship a profession under Modi\n\nSo, neither did the incident happen on the budget day nor did the Congress workers give any anti-Indian speech.\n\nFact Check: Ganga Expressway is not the longest as claimed by UP CM Yogi\n\nFact Check: No, Priyanka Gandhi is not drunk in this viral video", "lang": "en"}
