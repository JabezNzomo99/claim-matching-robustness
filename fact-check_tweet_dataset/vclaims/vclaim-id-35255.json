This is false; his film company said he did not write them, and an American author says that she did.\n\n\u201cPlease read this, especially if your first inclination is not to read it. I appreciated this so much,\u201d say posts shared here and here. Other users shared the 16 points using the hashtag #truth.\n\nNumerous posts attribute the thoughts to Howard. They continue to circulate online with his picture attached.\n\nMany users expressed approval for what was said to have been written by the 65-year-old Hollywood director, who shot to prominence as a child actor on \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show\u201d before attaining global stardom as Richie Cunningham in the American family sitcom, \u201cHappy Days.\u201d\n\nHe has since been the driving force behind films including \u201cApollo 13\u201d and \u201cA Beautiful Mind.\u201d The latter garnered four Academy Awards, including Best Director for Howard.\n\nThe points attributed to him mention immigration, religion and health care, specifically The Affordable Care Act -- known as Obamacare -- passed during president Barack Obama\u2019s first term. All three subjects are touchstone issues in the 2020 US presidential election.\n\nThe posts say that although Howard believes health care is a right, and not a privilege, \u201csomehow that's interpreted as \u2018I believe Obamacare is the end-all, be-all.\u2019\u201d It goes on to make other pointed remarks that are embraced by Facebook users.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don\u2019t want to work,\u201d Howard is claimed to say. There is also implicit criticism of US President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I can\u2019t get over an election, but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities,\u201d it says.\n\nBut Howard was not the author.\n\n\u201cRon Howard did not make the remarks to which you refer, on Facebook,\u201d Imagine Entertainment, the film and television production company founded by Howard and his co-creator Brian Grazer in 1986, told AFP.\n\nHoward, however, has aired political views on Twitter and responded to questions posed by users on subjects such as the experience that elected officials should bring to office, illustrating his willingness to engage with the public.\n\nFollowing the initial circulation of the posts, several users went on to say the remarks are the work of an author named Lori Gallagher Witt, with some correcting their Facebook posts to reflect this.\n\nIn an email to AFP, Gallagher Witt said that she did write a post on January 7, 2018, which she described at the time as an open letter to friends and family, explaining that she was a liberal. It included all 16 points later attributed to Howard.\n\nBlog posts such as this one also said Gallagher Witt was the original author.\n\nCurrently living in the US state of Maine, she said it was \u201cirritating\u201d that her work had been passed off as someone else\u2019s, but she was more alarmed about \u201cerroneous factual information\u201d being spread online in a heavily divided US political climate.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the information didn\u2019t change, just the source,\u201d she said. \u201cThe issue that bothered me the most was that the post was suddenly taken more seriously once it had a celebrity\u2019s name attached.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
