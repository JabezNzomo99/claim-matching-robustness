Ramakrishna hospital sealed..the whole hospital staff and patients are positive..\u201d The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. The hospital has been functioning normally and none of its staff or patients have tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nTo find the truth behind the viral post, we ran a search on the Internet with appropriate keywords and found a video tweeted by a local journalist in which Sri Rama Krishna Hospital owner Dr Hanumanth Rao clarifies on rumours spread about his institution.\n\nIn the video, Dr Rao can be heard saying none of the staff and patients in his hospital tested positive for coronavirus. Neither has the hospital been sealed. Sri Rama Krishna Hospital is a maternity and multi-specialty hospital in Hyderabad. It does not have a ward for Covid-19 patients.\n\nWe contacted Dr Rao and he reiterated the same to us. He said the hospital is functioning normally and as per usual timings. The hospital management has also put up a notice outside the premises saying, \u201cAttention. Please do not believe rumours. Hospital funtioning normally. Timings: 10 am to 6 pm.\u201d\n\nTill the filing of this story, as per latest data available on the website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Telangana reported a total of 4,484 coronavirus cases and 174 deaths.\n\nBut none of the staff and patients at Sri Rama Krishna Hospital in Hyderabad\u2019s Kachiguda area have tested positive for coronavirus. Neither has the hospital been sealed as is circulating on Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
