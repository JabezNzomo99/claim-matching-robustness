Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place,\u201d the quote continues.\n\nThis passage was actually written by Iain Thomas in 2007 and later published in his poetry collection \u201cI Wrote This For You.\u201d\n\nVonnegut was an American author best known for his satirical writing style. He wrote several novels that are considered classics, including \u201cSlaughterhouse-Five\u201d and \u201cCat\u2019s Cradle.\u201d\n\nVonnegut\u2019s status as a literary icon has prompted those on social media to share a myriad of quotes attributed to the author, though not always accurately.\n\nIn this case, the alleged quote is actually a poem called \u201cThe Fur,\u201d written by Thomas. He originally published the poem anonymously on his blog in 2007, but later included it in the poetry collection \u201cI Wrote This For You\u201d under his real name. The quote has since been falsely attributed to Vonnegut, despite Thomas\u2019 attempts to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cAt some point, somewhere on the internet, someone who I have no doubt really liked the quote, decided that it needed to have been said by someone more important and with a touch more gravitas than some, still living, semi-anonymous blogger somewhere,\u201d Thomas wrote in a 2016 article for HuffPost. \u201cSo they picked Kurt Vonnegut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for Thomas, particularly because he\u2019s gone to such lengths to correct the record,\u201d Thomas Hertweck, co-vice president of the Kurt Vonnegut Society and lecturer at the University of Massachusetts- Dartmouth, told The Daily Caller in an email. \u201cThis sort of thing happens all the time, especially since Vonnegut died.\u201d\n\nBesides Hertweck, Julia Whitehead, founder and CEO of the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library, and the museum\u2019s curator, Chris Lafave, also confirmed that Vonnegut did not pen this quote.\n\n\u201cThis quote has been misattributed to Vonnegut for some time, and while there is currently no permanent archive of everything Kurt ever said, it has never appeared in anything published or archived,\u201d Lafave told the Caller in an email.", "lang": "en"}
