Don't believe it.", "author": "verafiles.org", "date": "Aug 31, 2018, 3:38 PM", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-65829", "url": "https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-netizen-recycles-fake-story-claiming-n", "vclaim": "A netizen revived an old and fake report claiming Naga City is the country's \"shabu capital.\" Alleging in its caption that Vice-President Leni Robredo is a \"drug protector,\" the fabricated report carried the headline, \u201cRobredo\u2019s Hometown Naga City Named As Shabu Capital City Of The Philippines.\u201d\n\nVERA Files Fact Check debunked a similar story with the same headline published by a different website nearly two years ago. It claimed that the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) made the declaration. (See: THIS WEEK IN FAKE NEWS: Naga City NOT DECLARED by PDEA as shabu capital)\n\nThe PDEA has not published on its website or official Facebook (FB) page any report declaring Naga as the country\u2019s \u201cshabu\u201d (methamphetamine) capital. No legitimate media organization has carried any story making the same claim.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s May 31 post in public FB group Solid Duterte Supporters Worldwide bore only a screengrab of the fake November 2017 story published by website Social News Media Online. Its thumbnail misled viewers with an unrelated photo of illegal drugs placed on two long tables, and an inset showing Robredo.\n\nA reverse image search traces back the photo of illegal drugs to a May 2017 Reuters report about the seizure of 600 kilograms of shabu in Valenzuela City, Metro Manila -- not Naga.\n\nThe fake, three-year-old story of Social News Media Online remains live on its site. Apart from the fabrication that PDEA declared Robredo\u2019s hometown as the country\u2019s top shabu hotspot, it made an unsupported claim that Naga City and Camarines Sur province were \u201con the top of the lists of the cities and provinces having the most arrested drug personalities.\u201d\n\nSocial News Media Online\u2019s article also compiled excerpts from reports by ABS-CBN News, GMA News Online, Politiko Bicol, and even a press release by the Philippine National Police Region 5, among others.\n\nThe only source cited in Social News Media Online\u2019s story is OKD2, which was previously flagged by VERA Files Fact Check for spreading online disinformation. Opening the site prompts a warning from a browser saying it might be trying to steal personal information of the visitor.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s fake post surfaced a day after authorities announced that they seized a total of around 22 kilos of shabu worth P117 million in the Bicol region, where Naga is located, during the first quarter of the year.", "lang": "en"}
