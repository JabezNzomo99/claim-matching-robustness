The claim is false; the invoice shows assistance granted to a family of five, including a one-time start up allowance to help the family buy furniture and winter clothes. A single adult refugee will receive monthly assistance ranging from Can$567-$791 for one year depending on the province where he or she lives.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post was published here on September 25, 2019.\n\nThe caption states: \u201cThis is what 1 illegal refugee gets with the federal assistance program $3874 per month!!!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same image was published on Facebook here, here, here, here and here and on Reddit here with a similar claim.\n\nAFP analysed the document in the photo and found that although it appeared to be authentic, it does not detail payment to a single refugee. The center top box states, \u201cFamily size: 5.\u201d The invoice also details a one-time \u201cStart-up Allowance\u201d which is not paid monthly.\n\nThe first section of the invoice, titled \u201cStart-Up Allowances,\u201d shows assistance totalling Can$1,960. This number refers to a one-time amount that refugees receive upon arrival in Canada. It covers household items, furniture, linens, food staples, winter clothing, a deposit for utilities, phone installation and first month\u2019s rent.\n\nBelow is a chart showing current start-up assistance for all provinces, excluding Quebec, which offers refugees between Can$580 and Can$780, as used furniture and other household supplies are given directly to refugees from in-kind donations.\n\nThis start-up allowance is a one-time payment and does not constitute a monthly source of financial support.\n\nThe monthly benefit provided for one year to refugees includes a basic need allowance, a shelter allowance and a communication allowance.\n\nBelow is a chart detailing the allowances for a single adult in all provinces, excluding Quebec which bases its assistance on its provincial social aid program:\n\nEach adult also receives a transportation allowance \u201cper the rate of public transit in their community\u201d or of $75 if there is no public transit.\n\nOther special allowances may apply to families with newborns, women who are pregnant, people with medically verified dietary needs or if funeral/burial costs are needed.\n\n\u201cIncome support for government-assisted refugees is generally provided for up to one year after arrival, or until the refugees become self-sufficient -- whichever comes first,\u201d Nancy Caron, Media Relations Advisor for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the federal agency in charge of refugees, told AFP by email.\n\nAdditionally, many refugees are sponsored privately by organizations or individuals. Sponsors are legally obligated to grant refugees the same amount of income support as the government.\n\nIn 2017, \u201c44,747 people were admitted to Canada as resettled refugees, as permanent residents in the Protected Persons in Canada category or as people admitted for humanitarian and compassionate considerations and under public policies,\u201d according to the 2018 report to parliament on immigration.\n\nOf this number, the report said 62 percent were privately sponsored and five percent were admitted under the blended visa office-referred program, where financial assistance is shared between the government and private sponsors.\n\nThe Refugee Resettlement Program is a regular source of misinformation, and AFP Fact Check has written about other misleading posts here and here. This invoice also led to misinformation shared by US President Donald Trump about US federal assistance which AFP Fact Check debunked here.\n\nNo single immigrant receives Can$3,874 each month from a federal assistance program in Canada.", "lang": "en"}
