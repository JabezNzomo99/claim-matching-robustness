No, that's not true: The Minnesota state house voted a \"Comprehensive Sex Education\" provision that required each school district to teach sex ed, but it would not have mandated a specific curriclum. Stories falsely claimed the curriculum would be developed by Planned Parenthood and would include use of the controversial book \"It's Perfectly Normal.\" The legislation, however, did not mention Planned Parenthood and would have allowed local schools to decide on their teaching model.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) published by DeplorableHousewives.news on April 29, 2019 titled \"MN Democrats Vote For Elementary School Pornography\" which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThis article equates sex education with pornography, using a controversial book as the primary evidence. The book It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health (The Family Library) is described by Amazon as \"the definitive book about puberty and sexual health for today's kids and teens.\"\n\nIt uses cartoon drawings to illustrate sexual organs and activities, which can be shocking to parents. For that reason, it has been banned from many schools and libraries. The decision to use it in a Minnesota elementary sex ed class would be made by the local school leaders, and not by the state government under the proposal considered by the legislature.\n\nThese illustrations were included in the DeplorableHousewives.news article to demonstrate that the book is porn:\n\nThere is nothing in the legislation supported by Democrats that references this book or indicates it might be used in the sex ed classes, but if it were a mandated text, would this be pornography? Justice Potter Stewart's opinion in the 1964 Supreme Court ruling in Jacobellis v. Ohio made it clear that there was no universal definition of porn:\n\nThese images may be pornographic to the school superintendent in any Minnesota community, which would likely mean it would not be included in the sex ed class. The Democracts in the state house, however, dropped the sex education mandate from the education bill in the days before their annual session ended because of an impasse with the Republican-controlled state senate.", "lang": "en"}
