Mr. Trump said on Monday that he and Mr. Pence had tested negative for the virus. Three top public health officials have chosen to remain isolated for a period of time \u2014 Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration; and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. During Mr. Trump\u2019s afternoon news conference, senior White House aides could be seen standing along the side of the Rose Garden \u2014 all of them wearing masks. The White House also made some smaller changes, including displaying signs encouraging social distancing at entryways and asking aides during routine temperature checks if they are experiencing symptoms, according to officials. Monday\u2019s email said that West Wing staff members were \u201cnot required to wear a facial covering while at their desk if they are appropriately socially distanced from their colleagues.\u201d Many of the president\u2019s top aides and advisers have eschewed masks in their appearances with Mr. Trump, despite their own advice to their staffs to wear them. On Saturday, the defense secretary, Mark T. Esper, and the top military chiefs sat barefaced around the table with Mr. Trump at the White House, apparently in contradiction of policy at the Pentagon, where officials have been social distancing for two months and wearing masks for several weeks.\n\nMr. Esper had made a point of extolling the virtues of wearing masks while indoors during a visit to United States Northern Command in Colorado earlier in the week, saying that \u201cin the open air, it\u2019s not as essential,\u201d but adding that \u201cin a room, we\u2019re wearing masks.\u201d The new White House policy on masks came as Mr. Trump tried to reinvent his government\u2019s troubled history on testing for the coronavirus, claiming that the United States was \u201cunmatched and unrivaled\u201d in its testing capacity but ignoring the early failures to provide testing that allowed the virus to spread invisibly for months. Declaring once again that \u201cif somebody wants to be tested right now, they\u2019ll be able to be tested,\u201d Mr. Trump said that his administration was working with states to allow them to conduct 12.9 million tests in May, insisting that the testing ability in the United States compares favorably with other countries. \u201cWe are testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland and many other countries,\u201d he said, ignoring countries where testing on a per capita basis is higher, including Germany, Russia, Spain, Canada, Switzerland and at least 20 others, according to statistics compiled by Our World in Data.\n\u2022 Microsoft announces a move back to the office for some workers.\n\u2022 The subway is the lifeblood of New York, but can it bounce back?\n\u2022 The U.A.E. offers a third dose of Chinese vaccine to some with low immune response. Flanked by large posters that proclaimed \u201cAmerica leads the world in testing,\u201d Mr. Trump also declared victory over the pandemic, saying that \u201cwe have met the moment and we have prevailed.\u201d Later, under questioning, he revised his comments, saying he only meant to say the country had prevailed on increasing access to testing.\n\nThe president\u2019s claim about testing being available for anyone was also misleading. It is one thing to have enough testing capacity for everyone who is symptomatic or has been in contact with someone who has tested positive, but that is quite different from having enough to provide reassurance to people considering returning to normal life. The president announced that his administration had begun distributing $11 billion for testing approved by Congress almost six weeks ago and claimed that Germany and the United States were \u201cleading the world in lives saved per 100,000.\u201d That was also an exaggeration. Germany does have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world, at 9.13 deaths per 100,000 people. The United States, by comparison, has a rate of 24.31 deaths per 100,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That is lower than several other European countries, like Britain, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium and Sweden, but it is also higher than that of Canada, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Iran, Brazil and many others. Mr. Trump also mischaracterized the trajectory of new cases in the United States. \u201cThe numbers are way down from what they were two weeks ago,\u201d the president said. \u201cThe numbers are really coming down very substantially. This weekend was one of the lowest we\u2019ve had. The numbers are coming down very rapidly.\u201d The number of new cases reported across the country this weekend was 45,227. That is lower than the 60,872 cases reported from April 25 to April 26. But over the past two weeks, the numbers of new cases over all have declined only slightly \u2014 not substantially. Moreover, that trend is not \u201cuniversal\u201d across the country, as Mr. Trump claimed. While the figures in the New York City region have fallen, new cases are increasing in nine states and remained largely unchanged in more than two dozen. The president abruptly ended his news conference after an Asian-American reporter pressed him on why he suggested that she \u201cask China\u201d in response to a question on coronavirus death rates.", "lang": "en"}
