One post on Facebook claims U.S. citizens must \u201cgo to 2020census.gov and fill out this census form so you can get your stimulus check.\u201d\n\nThis is incorrect, however. The Census Bureau notes on its website that a person\u2019s answers to the census questions \u201ccannot be used to impact your eligibility for any government benefits, including any potential stimulus package.\u201d\n\nFederal law prevents the Census Bureau from using individual responses for anything other than producing statistics, according to the Census Bureau website.
