Gurumurthy claimed that they were beaten by Rohingya refugees.\n\n\u201cLook how BJP West Bengal chief was welcomed in a Rohingya slum in the state. Think about what will happen to common citizens if this is how he is treated. This is Mamata Banerjee\u2019s West Bengal. We need freedom from this to make Bengal Sonar Bangla,\u201d is another message shared with the video.\n\nIt is also circulating on Facebook with the same claim.\n\nChairman of Manipal Global Education Mohandas Pai tweeted the video on March 19 however without the Rohingya angle.\n\nThe clip was shared with a similar message in English \u2013 \u201cRohingya Muslims push out Hindus from West Bengal\u201d \u2013 last year.\n\nIt was also shared in 2019 with the following message, \u201cPlease send this video to your relatives who are residing in a poll-bound state. If our society doesn\u2019t come out in huge numbers for Modi then these heretics, \u201cBangladeshi and Rohingya Muslims\u201d, will repeat this act across the country, as they did in Kolkata. There\u2019s still some time left, wake up.\u201d\n\nThe above caption was tweeted by a user Ananda in Hindi in April 2019. One more user by the name of \u2018Hitesh\u2018 also tweeted the video with an identical narrative.\n\nMany individuals on Facebook and Twitter shared this video with the same message.\n\nAlt News found that the video circulating on social media is old and unrelated to the claim. This incident had taken place in 2017 in Darjeeling and NOT Kolkata. BJP West Bengal President Dilip Ghosh was chased and heckled. It was reported by several media outlets, including ABP News. This clip was broadcasted by the channel in October 2017 when the incident had occurred.\n\nA BJP delegation led by the party President had visited the city after a 104-day strike for a separate Gorkhaland was withdrawn by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. Ghosh was in Darjeeling on October 5, 2017, when he was allegedly thrashed by supporters of the Gorkha Territorial Administration\u2019s chairman Binay Tamang.\n\nIn conclusion, an unrelated video of BJP members heckled and chased away in Darjeeling in 2017 was shared as Bangladeshi and Rohingya refugees assaulting them. In the past as well, Rohingya refugees residing in India have been targeted with misinformation. The video was earlier circulated as an incident where BJP members were heckled and chased away while asking for votes. It was also shared ahead of 2020 Bihar elections.", "lang": "en"}
