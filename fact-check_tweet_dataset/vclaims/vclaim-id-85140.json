FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have covered the facts, and we wrote about the deal briefly in a speech roundup. But with the renewed attention this month, we decided to take a deeper look at Clinton\u2019s role in this deal.\n\nDue to confidentiality laws, there are few details made public about the deal or about Clinton\u2019s role in it, factcheck.org found. The Clinton campaign said Clinton herself was not involved in the State Department\u2019s review and did not direct the department to take any position on the sale of Uranium One. Matters of the CFIUS did not rise to the level of the secretary, the campaign said.\n\nYet the Uranium One deal was not on the radar of Michael McFaul, even though he was aware of many CFIUS cases in his role as the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs from 2009 to 2012 (and as a prime architect of the administration\u2019s reset policy). McFaul, now senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, said Fernandez could not \u201cdictate the outcome of any decision single-handedly,\u201d as he was one of nine members.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers in 2010 did raise concerns about the deal \u2014 but they sent their letter to then-Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. (Treasury chairs the CFIUS.) Final approval was given by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which noted that the mines would remain under the control of U.S. subsidiaries. \u201cNeither Uranium One nor ARMZ [the Russian firm] holds an NRC export license, so no uranium produced at either facility may be exported,\u201d the NRC said. (Some uranium yellowcake is extracted, processed in Canada and returned to the United States.)\n\n[Update, Nov. 2, 2017: The Hill newspaper, citing documents, reported on Nov. 2 that some of the uranium from Uranium One facilities was exported to Europe. We had noted before that the uranium could not be exported, with the exception of yellowcake being shipped to Canada for conversion with the expectation it would be returned to the United States. But once Uranium One\u2019s material arrived in Canada, it apparently was mixed with yellowcake from other suppliers \u2013 and then Canada received permission from the Energy Department to send converted U.S. uranium to Europe for enrichment. Uranium One says it sold about 25 percent of its U.S.-extracted yellowcake via \u201cbook transfer\u201d to customers overseas\u2014which does not necessarily mean the material moved because ownership in commodity markets is not the same as possession. U.S. officials say it is unknown whether any uranium extracted by Uranium One was transferred overseas.]\n\nDid the Clintons get paid for the Russian deal? The Trump campaign pointed to donations to the Clinton Foundation, as reported by the Times. Giustra became friends with Bill Clinton in 2005, over their charity work. The Washington Post took an in-depth look at their ties and described their friendship as one \u201cthat has helped propel the Clinton Foundation into a global giant and established Giustra\u2019s reputation as an international philanthropist while helping him build connections in countries where his business was expanding.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign also noted that Bill Clinton received speaking fees while the Uranium One deal was underway. After the Russians announced that they would acquire stakes in Uranium One, and while the Kremlin was promoting the purchase, Bill Clinton received $500,000 in 2010 for a speech in Moscow from a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin. Putin personally thanked Clinton, the Wall Street Journal reported, adding that a review of Bill Clinton\u2019s speeches \u201cfound no evidence that speaking fees were paid to the former president in exchange for any action by Mrs. Clinton.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
