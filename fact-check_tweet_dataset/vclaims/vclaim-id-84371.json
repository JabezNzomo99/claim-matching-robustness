Post the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019, Ranaut and Azmi had engaged in a war of words after the latter was accused of being an 'anti-national' by Ranaut. However, Ranaut did not take a dig at Islam later, as was claimed in the tweet . On September 29, 2017, Azmi had tweeted an image about Durga Ashtami and had faced flak for it. We had found similarities between Ranaut\u2019s fake quote and several replies to Azmi\u2019s tweet. BOOM had previously fact-checked the same fake quote in April 2018.", "lang": "en"}
