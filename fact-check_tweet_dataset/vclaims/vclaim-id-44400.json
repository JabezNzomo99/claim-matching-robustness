I thought I was cold until I chatted with Daniel Schetter, one of our local winter surfers (You\u2019ll LOVE his beard!) I even ran into our local running Santa, Bill Sved. Enjoy!\n\nAs per the description, the man appearing in the video is Winter surfer Daniel Schetter.\n\nNow we started looking for information about Daniel Schetter by Google Search. We found the Instagram account of Daniel Schetter (upsurferdan). After scanning his account, we found that Daniel is the guy shown in the viral image.
