The existing mandates define the official languages of the Organization, but do not define the status of languages and dialects. The United Nations General Assembly therefore did not provide guidance on the status of Cantonese.\n\n\u201cIn the United Nations context, such a category (leading languages in daily use) does not exist.\n\n\u201cMandarin, and not Cantonese, is one of the six official languages of the UN and is therefore in use at the UN on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nThe six official languages at the UN are Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish, according to the organisation\u2019s website.\n\n-- Cantonese in Australia, Canada and the US --\n\nAccording to the results of Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 2016 census, Cantonese was indeed the fourth most commonly spoken language by a person at home in the country, after English, Mandarin and Arabic -- not English, Italian and Greek as the misleading post claims.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant graph:\n\nCanada\u2019s Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages stated in 2018 that Cantonese was the country\u2019s fourth, not the third as claimed by the misleading post, top language, after English, French and Mandarin.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant information:\n\nAccording to data released in 2015 by the United States Census Bureau entitled \u201cDetailed Languages Spoken at Home and Ability to Speak English for the Population 5 Years and Over for United States: 2009-2013\u201d, nearly 80 percent of the interviewees spoke only English at home, while nearly 13 percent spoke Spanish.\n\nWhile Chinese collectively was the third most commonly spoken language in the US, it included various Chinese languages and dialects such as Mandarin and Cantonese.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant data:\n\nThe Hong Kong government states on its website: \u201cChinese and English are the official languages of Hong Kong. English is widely used in the Government and by the legal, professional and business sectors.\n\n\u201cTrilingual professionals who speak English, Cantonese and Putonghua play a vital role in the numerous enterprises trading in Hong Kong or doing business with mainland China and Taiwan.\u201d\n\nAccording to the government\u2019s 2016 statistics, Cantonese speakers constituted nearly 90 percent of the population, while speakers of Mandarin and other Chinese dialects made up around 5 percent.\n\nChinese and Portuguese are the official languages of Macau, according to the government of the special administrative region and former Portuguese colony.\n\nThe Macau government also states that Cantonese is spoken by more than 80 percent of the population and Portuguese spoken by about 2.3 percent, according to its 2016 statistics.", "lang": "en"}
