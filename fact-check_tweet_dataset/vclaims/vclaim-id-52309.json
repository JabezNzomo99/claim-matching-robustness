But the punch doesn\u2019t land because the photo, of a crowd of people in white hoods standing in front of a burning cross with their arms outstretched, is miscaptioned.\n\n\"The Democratic National Convention of 1924,\" the post says. \"Not kidding. It really is.\"\n\nIt really isn\u2019t. And the post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe did a reverse image search of the photo and found it in a 2015 Chicago Tribune article about the city welcoming the KKK. The caption of the photo says: \"Thousands of Klansmen gather in August 1921 for an initiation ceremony on a farm near Lake Zurich owned by Charles Weeghman, who owned the Chicago Cubs. The procession there began in Chicago\u2019s Albany Park neighborhood.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Convention was held at Madison Square Garden in New York in 1924. Back then, the KKK was the \"most powerful bloc in the Democratic Party,\" according to the New York Times. During the convention, 20,000 klan members attended a rally across the river in New Jersey. But the photo in this Facebook post doesn\u2019t show that gathering.", "lang": "en"}
