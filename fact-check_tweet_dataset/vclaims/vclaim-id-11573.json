He\u2019s not a candidate, but he is campaigning for Democrats. And some detractors are reviving an old dig against the former president.\n\n\"One day we will realize that the Barack Obama presidency was the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the American people,\" reads a quote in an image that was posted to Facebook on Nov. 4. It\u2019s attributed to Clint Eastwood and appears next to a picture of the actor sitting on a stool.\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nEastwood isn\u2019t sitting on the stool\u2014the empty one he talked to during the 2012 Republican National Convention, pretending Obama was seated next to him on stage. He considered the appearance a success, and he said so to the Carmel Pine Cone a few days later. The newspaper covers Eastwood\u2019s hometown, where he was elected mayor in 1986.\n\nA story published in the paper on Sept. 7, 2012, reports that Eastwood had three points that he wanted to make that day: \"That not everybody in Hollywood is on the left, that Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office, and that the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who\u2019s not doing a good job.\"\n\n\"President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people,\" the paper quotes Eastwood as saying. \"(Mitt) Romney and (Paul) Ryan would do a much better job running the country, and that\u2019s what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of the lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not quite what the Facebook post said. Eastwood was talking about Obama, the person, not his presidency. And he called the then-president a hoax, not a fraud.\n\nStill, the quote is close to the spirit of Eastwood\u2019s comments. One person who did get it right?\n\nDonald Trump. Three days after the story ran, he tweeted: \"\u2018President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.\u2019 --Clint Eastwood\"\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
