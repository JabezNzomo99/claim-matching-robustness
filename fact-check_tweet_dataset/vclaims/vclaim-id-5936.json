According to the Lancashire tradition, James I drew his short sword and told the Hoghton Tower pages to bring the beef to him. They went down on their knees and the king said \u201cArise, Sir Loin.\u201d\n\nWhile it is certainly possible that one or more England monarchs has repeated this pun, the word \u201csirloin\u201d first appeared in English as far back as the early sixteenth century and therefore (with the possible exception of antedates the reigns of any of the kings commonly cited as having originated it by knighting a piece of beef (e.g., James I, Charles II).\n\nThe real death blow to the \u201csir loin\u201d etymology, however, is the fact that the word sirloin was originally written as \u201csurloyn\u201d or \u201csurloine\u201d in English, reflecting its origins in the Middle French word surlonge (\u201csur la longe\u201d), with sur meaning \u201cover\u201d and longe meaning \u201cloin\u201d \u2014 hence sirloin was a cut of beef taken from above the loin. Not until considerably later did the common English spelling of the word shift towards using an \u201ci\u201d in place of the \u201cu,\u201d thus giving license to generations of punsters.\n\nThe English word surname stems from the same French root, indicating a family name that was used \u201cover\u201d (i.e., in addition to) one\u2019s Christian name.", "lang": "en"}
