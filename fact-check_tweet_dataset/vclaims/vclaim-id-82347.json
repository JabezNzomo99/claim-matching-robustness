Within five years, Modi and Amit Shah have done to the country what Pakistan hasn\u2019t been able to do in 70 years. Within five years, Modi and Amit Shah have injected poison inside the people of this country. Pitting Hindus against the Muslims, Muslims against Christians, creating enmity amongst each other. What Pakistan could not do in 70 years, that has been done by Modi and Amit Shah within five years. Friends, this pair will ruin this country.
