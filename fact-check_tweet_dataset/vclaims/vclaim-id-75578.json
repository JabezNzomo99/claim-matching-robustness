Therefore, this news coverage stating that Adani Group leased AW139 Helicopter support to any political party or airlifting of Mr Gurmeet Singh, is an absolute lie and a figment of motivated imagination. This news article seems to have been made purely to sensationalise and malign the public image of one of the most respected corporate Group of India namely the Adani Group, \" a spokesperson for the group told BOOM in an email.\n\nThe spokesperson also said that although the group had placed an order for a helicopter in the past, it was subsequently cancelled. A 2011 Times of India article and a press release from AugustaWestland state Adani Group had purchased an AW 139 helicopter in February 2011.\n\n\"We had placed an order for an helicopter a few years go to be part of the fleet but later cancelled the same. We did not own any helicopter then and none now,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nJanta Ka Reporter's story said several questions emerged after an image of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh seated in a AW 139 helicopter being flown away to Rohtak jail spread on social media along with a 2014 picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelling in a helicopter of the same make.\n\nMany Twitter users failed to recognise that 'AW 139' (AugustaWestland) is the model number of the helicopter and not a registration number. The AW139 is a 15-seat medium-sized twin-engined helicopter manufactured by Italy's AgustaWestland S.p.A. It uses range from VIP and corporate transport, offshore transport, fire fighting, law enforcement, search and rescue among others.\n\nThe company, a subsidiary of Italy's state backed defence company Finmeccanica, has a controversial history with India and is embroiled in a bribery scandal that dates back to a 2010 order where several politicians belonging to the Congress-led UPA regime and military officials were accused of taking bribes from the company.

(Source: The Telegraph's 'Modi flies into brand cloud')\n\nThe AW 139 helicopter Modi used to arrive at an election campaign rally in 2014 belonged to DLF.\n\nThis is supported by a April 2014 Times of India article -Fleet of 3 aircraft ensures Modi is home every night after day's campaigning\n\n\"Over the past few days, Modi flew in an Augusta AW-139 chopper, owned by the DLF Group, for his rallies in north India, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\"\n\nHaryana Additional Chief Secretary Ram Niwas said the helicopter was leased by the state from a private company.\n\nIn an interview to Hindi newspaper Dainik Bhaskar, Additional Chief Secretary, Ram Nivas said the AW 139 was leased from a private charter company and not from Adani.\n\nHaryana\u2019s Manohar Lal Khattar government is under fire for its shoddy handling of the large scale violence that claimed 35 lives and injured 250 on Friday following the conviction of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.", "lang": "en"}
