India has also shown the least progress in happiness level since 2008-10 (base period), among neighbouring countries. In contrast, Pakistan tops with the highest score and the most improvement in the region.\n\nThe report, first published in 2012, ranks countries based on its happiness level / well-being and the progress made over the years. It is released by United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, an international organization that promotes sustainable development.\n\nThe ranking is based on data from Gallup World Polls. The respondents are asked to rate their lives on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the worst possible life and 10 the best possible life.\n\nWolrd Happiness Report (WHR) 2018 uses data between 2015-17. Likewise, WHR 2017 used data between 2014-16. Data for three years are combined to increase the sample size and reduce random sampling errors. The annual sample size is 1000, and for those countries with data for all three years, the sample size is 3000.\n\nAccordingly, India has a happiness score of 4.19 in 2018 against 4.32 in 2017. As seen below, India's performance has shown a declining trend since 2013 (comparable data is available since 2013).\n\nSource: World Happiness Report. Note: Report for 2014 is not available on the website\n\nScandinavian countries - Finland (score - 7.63), Norway (7.59) and Denmark (7.5) bagged the first three ranks. Burundi (2.9), Central African Republic (3.08) and South Sudan (3.25) ranked last in the happiness score.\n\nBarring Afghanistan, India is the least happy among the SAARC countries. In this category, Pakistan is the happiest with a score of 5.5 followed by Bhutan (5.08) and Nepal (4.8).\n\nSource: World Happiness Report 2018. Note: Data for Maldives is not available.\n\nIndia (4.2) scores the lowest among BRICS countries. Brazil leads with a score of 6.4 followed by Russia (5.8) and China (5.3).\n\nChanges in levels of happiness: How has India fared over the years?\n\nIn terms of change in the happiness score, India ranks 128th among 141 countries. Between 2008-10 and 2015-17, India\u2019s happiness score has fallen by -0.698, on a scale of 0-10. It is one of the 59 countries to witness a significant fall in happiness for the period under consideration.\n\nWHR 2018 revised the base period to 2008-10, and the changes are measured from then to 2015-2017.\n\nIndia has also registered the worst performance among both SAARC and BRICS countries. While Pakistan is best placed at 27th with an improvement score of +0.47, Afghanistan finds itself one place ahead of India at 127th position (-0.688).\n\nSource: World Happiness Report 2018. Note: Data for Bhutan and Maldives are not available.\n\nThe report uses six key variables namely, GDP per capita, social support, healthy life, expectancy, social freedom, generosity, and absence of corruption to understand the extent to which these variables explain the score.\n\nThe report says, \u2018We do not construct our happiness measure in each country using these six factors \u2013 the scores are instead based on individuals\u2019 own assessments of their subjective well-being\u2019.\n\n1. GDP per capita: It serves as an indicator of a country\u2019s standard of living. A higher per capita GDP indicates a better standard of living and vice versa.\n\n2. Healthy Life Expectancy: This variable captures the estimated number of years a person will live in a \u2018healthy state\u2019, defined by WHO standards.\n\n3. Social support: A dummy variable is constructed taking binary values that denote whether or not a person is part of a supportive social network. It captures the social assistance available to a person in times of need.\n\n4. Freedom to make life choices: It is a binary variable which indicates how free a person is in making his/her personal choices.\n\n5. Generosity: This too is qualitative variable that indicates how generous a populace is. Technically, it captures that part of charitable behavior people that cannot be wholly explained by their incomes alone.\n\n6. Perceptions of corruption: A binary variable based on a person\u2019s general perception of corruption in government and businesses.\n\nThe key factors of a country are pitched against a hypothetical country \u2018dystopia\u2019 which has the lowest score for each of these factors across countries. \u2018Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world\u2019s least-happy people\u2019, says the report.\n\nIn 2018, the happiness score of Dystopia is 1.92. The higher the score than 1.92, the happier the country is.\n\nThe extent of the happiness score explained by each factor is indicated by the size of the sub bars. The last sub bar indicates that portion of the score which is not explained by any of the 6 key factors.", "lang": "en"}
