The claim is false; the video clip was circulating online long before the US government announced an expansion of the country\u2019s travel restriction list to include Nigeria.\n\nThe claim first appeared in this tweet published on February 1, 2020, a day after the US government announced new visa restrictions on citizens of Nigeria, as well as citizens from five other countries, effective February 21, 2020.\n\nThe 22-second clip was reposted with a similar caption in this tweet, which has been shared nearly 2,000 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cBREAKING NEWS: Nigeria Ambassador to the US arrives Washington DC to discuss the travel ban with President Donald Trump [sic]\u201d.\n\nThe video clip shows Sylvanus Adiewere Nsofor, Nigeria\u2019s ambassador to the US, limping and using a walking stick. He is accompanied by two men, including one in Nigerian military uniform.\n\nThe footage has been viewed more than 170,000 times, including reposts, and was also shared with similar claims here and here on Facebook, as well as here and here on Twitter.\n\nBut the claim is false: The viral footage was already circulating on social media well before January 31, 2020, the date on which the Trump administration announced an expansion of the country\u2019s travel ban list to include Nigeria, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Sudan, and Tanzania.\n\nUsing the video verification tool InVID to conduct reverse image searches, AFP found that the video had been published in a tweet months earlier, back in September 2019.\n\nMoreover, the video does not show the ambassador in Washington DC, as some of the misleading tweets claimed, but in New York City.\n\nAFP tracked down another video that was filmed in the same location as the first video. It was tweeted on September 23, 2019 by Simon Ateba, a Nigerian journalist and the publisher of US-based Today News Africa. In his tweet, Ateba said he met the ambassador when he paid a visit to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who was in New York to participate in the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nSignage visible in both videos indicate that it was filmed at the United Nations Plaza. Using Google Street View, AFP confirmed that the video was indeed shot at the United Nations Plaza in New York City.\n\nArchitectural features and other matching features are visible in both of the videos and on Google Street View, including a \u201cNo Smoking\u201d symbol and inscriptions showing \u201cONE UN\u201d and \u201cUnited Nations Plaza Tower\u201d (see below).\n\nMatching features are also visible when looking from a different direction in Google Street View.\n\nNsofor, 84, is a retired justice from Nigeria\u2019s Court of Appeal whose nomination as a non-career ambassador was at first rejected by Nigeria\u2019s senate amid concerns about his age.\n\nSince his appointment was confirmed in June 2017, following a second nomination by Nigeria's president, Nsofor\u2019s age and physical appearance have become a recurrent subject of debate in Nigeria.", "lang": "en"}
