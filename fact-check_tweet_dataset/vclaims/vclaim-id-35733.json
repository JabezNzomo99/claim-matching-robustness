The post continues: \u201cAs a result of this the Greens gained the balance of power and signed the Native Forest Protection Act, which defunded National Park Rangers and Control Burn Programs\u201d.\n\nThe text appears above a photo of Ms Gillard and Mr Brown each signing a document, with then-treasurer Wayne Swan and Greens MPs Rachel Siewert, Christine Milne, Sarah Hanson-Young and Adam Bandt standing behind them.\n\nThe post has been viewed more than 20,000 times and has been shared more than 170 times.\n\nThe first claim in the post is that \u201cin 2010 Bob Brown led the Australian Greens with the ALP, which allowed Prime Minister Julia Gillard to form government.\u201d\n\nIn 2010 Labor leader Ms Gillard formed a minority government with the support of three independent MPs \u2013 Andrew Wilkie, Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor \u2013 along with Greens MP Adam Bandt. The minority government came after a closely contested federal election sparked by the removal of Kevin Rudd as prime minister.\n\nThe post then goes on to say, \u201cAs a result of this the Greens gained the balance of power and signed the Native Forest Protection Act, which defunded National Park Rangers and Control Burn Programs.\u201d\n\nThe first part of the claim states the Greens gained the balance of power as a result of forming government with the ALP, however a Parliamentary Library research paper states the party held the balance of power by having nine senators \u2013 not by forming a minority government with Labor.\n\nThe research paper describes the Greens\u2019 hold on the balance of power at the time as an \u201cinfluential position\u201d which allowed them to determine the outcome of votes in the Senate whenever the government and opposition were at odds. Minor parties and independents have held the balance of power from 1981-2005 and since 2008.\n\nThe second part of the claim states the parties then \u201csigned the Native Forest Protection Act\u201d.\n\nThe Federal Register of Legislation, which lists and tracks all Australian Government legislation and related documents, has no record of a Native Forest Protection Act. A search of the lists of acts that are in force, no longer in force or as made also makes no mention of the bill.\n\nAustralian parliamentary online archives show that a bill called \u201cNative Forest Protection Bill 1996\u201d was introduced to the Senate in 1996 and was read by Mr Brown in the Senate that year.\n\nAn explanatory memorandum tabled with the bill stated the purpose of the proposed law was to provide protection to native forests by prohibiting logging and the exportation of wood chips derived from native forests. But the bill, which was introduced to parliament in 1996, not 2010, did not become law as it was not passed by the parliament. The bill also did not propose cuts to national park rangers or controlled burn programs, which are not the responsibility of the federal government.\n\nThe bill\u2019s author, then newly-elected Tasmanian senator and Australian Greens leader Bob Brown, hoped the bill would \u201cextend a mantle of protection over areas that have been identified by experts as having World Heritage values\u201c.\n\n\u201cThis Bill aims to secure for the future the wonderful forests of this nation, from the South-West wilderness of Tasmania to the karri forests of Western Australia, and from East Gippsland up through the forests of New South Wales to Queensland,\u201d Mr Brown told the Senate in September 1996.\n\nThe photo used in the Facebook post is a September 1, 2010 image of Ms Gillard and Mr Brown signing the agreement that formalised Greens support for a minority Labor government. Gillard-led Labor did not secure the support of independents Oakeshott and Windsor, allowing it to form minority government, until September 7.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP Factcheck found the Facebook post to be false. The Gillard Labor government did form a minority government with the support of the Greens in 2010 but also with the support of three key independents. The Greens held the balance of power in the upper house through the election of nine senators. The two parties did not \u201csign the Native Forest Protection Act\u201d but rather an agreement to support a Labor minority government. There is no \u201cNative Forest Protection Act\u201d but rather there was a 1996 Native Forest Protection Bill which did not become law. That failed bill also did not seek to defund national park rangers and controlled burn programs.
