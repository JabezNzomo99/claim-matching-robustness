The figure used in the Observer compares 2009/10 with 2017/18, which are not comparable.\n\nNHS England said that since 2013/14, the drop may have been affected by trusts reclassifying beds so they are no longer \u201cconsultant-led\u201d, and are instead run by \u201cmultidisciplinary teams\u201d.\n\nThis is for beds under the care of consultants, so won\u2019t cover all beds for people suffering with a mental illness.\n\nThe number of hospital beds in general has fallen over the last 30 years, despite rising population and patient numbers, mainly because of advances in medicine.\n\nThe number of mental illness overnight beds dropped by 62% in the 20 years to 2009.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund put this decrease down to the \u201cpolicy shift to providing care for people with mental health problems and learning disabilities in the community rather than in institutional settings\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe number of full-time equivalent (FTE) mental health and learning disabilities nurses dropped by 16%, or by around 7,500 between September 2009 and September 2017.\n\nThe figures quoted in the claim compared the number of mental health and learning disability nurses between September 2009 and March 2018, but as the number of nurses working in the NHS in England changes throughout the year this isn\u2019t a fair comparison.\n\nThe majority of these nurses (90% in March 2018) are mental health nurses, with the rest working with patients with learning disabilities.\n\n10% of these nurses work with people with learning disabilities and difficulties, and are included in the number of mental health nurses because of a wider definition of \u201cmental health nurses\u201d used by NHS Digital, which publishes the figures.\n\nJust looking at nurses working in mental health, the number has fallen by 13%, or by 5,200 between September 2009 and September 2017.\n\nFollowing their two foundations years of training after medical school, junior doctors can choose to specialise.\n\nThere were the equivalent of around 3,200 full-time junior doctors specialising in psychiatry training in September 2009. That number had fallen by around 500, or 15% by September 2017\u2014the most recent comparable figures.\n\nThere were around 2,600 FTE junior doctors in psychiatry training in March 2018.\n\nA report from Health Education England published in 2017 said not enough newly qualified doctors were \u201cchoosing/able to train in psychiatry\u201d and that there was a higher proportion of unfilled core psychiatry training posts than in any other speciality.\n\nIt said that there were \u201clow direct transition rates\u201d from core psychiatry training into more specialised training and that the field relied on non-UK doctors choosing to specialise. It also said the workforce heavily relied on doctors who are neither training nor consultants, for which there isn\u2019t \u201ca secure supply pipeline\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
