No, that's not true: a story circulating online that made this claim was posted by a satirical website that tries to trick conservatives and Republicans into sharing fake news so they can then be mocked for it. The events described in the article did not actually happen and there are several hints in it that make it clear the whole thing is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line Of Defense on August 7, 2018 titled \"Van Full of Illegals Caught Voting in Ohio Special Election\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe Ohio special election race between Democrat Troy Balderson and Republican Danny O'Connor has been heated. Balderson has whipped out many dirty tricks, including personal attacks accusing O'Connor of being a Nazi and the usual Democrat accusations of \"racism\" and \"Russian collusion.\" But now, they have gone too far! Once again, like they did in California, Pennsylvania, and New Mexico in 2016, the Leftist scumbags have recruited illegals to cast fake ballots. It was quite a scene here at Bob Moller Middle School when police suddenly surrounded a van in the parking lot. According to witnesses, the Shermer Police Department pulled nine Hispanic men out of the van. \"An investigation revealed that the men were voting in the District 12 special election for the House of Representatives to replace Republican Pat Tiberi,\" Police Chief Mark Wallman said. \"These individuals had voted in two other locations using fake IDs.\" The nine men were seen and caught on security camera using their false identitication to vote for the Democrat contender.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, offering no clue the story was fake:\n\nSeveral items in the story don't make sense:\n\u2022 There is no place named \"Shermer\" in Ohio, so there is no Shermer Police Department and no Shermer Gazette either.\n\u2022 There is no \"Bob Moller Middle School\". The name does sound a bit like Robert Mueller, the head of the Special Counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and related matters.\n\u2022 The story references \" illegal immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, and Cuba\". Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and its inhabitants are U.S. citizens so they are by definition not immigrants (illegal or not).\n\u2022 None The party affiliation of Troy Balderson and Danny O'Connor is switched in the story.\n\u2022 None The header of the site carries the warning \"Information you probably shouldn't trust\".\n\nThe site (and sites related to it) pulled several other hoaxes in the past involving vehicles of increasing size full of illegal immigrants voting in U.S. elections or trying to sneak past the border:\n\nIf all that isn't enough the site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about americaslastlineofdefense.org before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: BREAKING: Michael Cohen NOT Caught On Tape Colluding With Hillary Clinton\n\u2022 Fake News: CNN Did NOT Fire Jake Tapper For Assaulting Eric Trump\n\u2022 Fake News: Eric Trump Did NOT Get In A Fistfight With A CNN Anchor, NOBODY Went To Jail\n\u2022 Fake News: Muslim Mayor Did NOT Cancel 4th Of July In Haskentot, Minnesota\n\u2022 Fake News: President Trump Did NOT Just Fire Muslim Judge Salam al Alsawatha Malallahafa", "lang": "en"}
