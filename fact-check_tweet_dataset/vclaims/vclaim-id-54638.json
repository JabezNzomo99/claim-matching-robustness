On the other hand, extinction involves the death of the last individual of a certain species. A handful of animals have become functionally extinct within the last few decades, including the northern white rhinoceros.\n\nIn the case of reef sharks, which include species that spend a majority of their life near reef ecosystems \u2014 like whitetip and blacktip reef sharks, lemon sharks, and great hammerheads \u2014 functional extinction means they no can no longer contribute to the marine food web through preying on large, herbaceous fish and could ultimately lead to catastrophic consequences in coral reef systems that depend on them. As the top predator in their ecosystem, reef sharks play a key role in balancing marine food webs, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nBut overfishing has depleted their number to the point that some may no longer be able to fulfill their role in the marine ecosystem, according to the study published in the journal Nature.\n\nThough it\u2019s been known that the overexploitation of marine resources has \u201cdevastated\u201d shark populations in recent decades, understanding their ecological status has largely relied on catch records and limited data. To bridge this information gap and to better understand shark species that live in coastal environments, a team of researchers from Dalhousie University in Canada deployed 15,000 underwater video cameras at hundreds of coral reefs around the world in 60 tropical countries. Over four years, this data was used in order to build a baseline understanding of the animals. Operating as part of the Global FinPrint conservation and research program, video stations included a camera mounted on a frame that contained more than 2 pounds (1 kilogram) of fish bait and were aptly given the nickname \u201cchum cam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis study pulls back the curtain on the state of reef sharks around the world,\u201d said study lead author Aaron MacNeil, associate professor in Biology at Dalhousie, in a university statement. \u201cWhile reef sharks have been studied in a few places, this work gives us a basis for understanding the extent and magnitude of the impact people have had on reef sharks, and what we might do about it.\u201d\n\nCollectively, more than 15,000 video hours and 59 species of sharks were analyzed in what became the largest and most comprehensive collection of data on reef sharks.\n\nThe results revealed the \u201cprofound impact\u201d that overfishing has had on shark populations in some parts of the world. One-in-five reef systems studied were void of vital reef sharks and in 800 survey hours, just three reef sharks were seen around reefs located in the Dominican Republic, the French West Indies, Kenya, Vietnam, the Windward Dutch Antilles, and Qatar.\n\nAs part of their work, the researchers also identified conservation measures that could help shark populations recover. Countries with effective shark conservation include those that were generally well-governed and have banned shark fishing or introduced science-based management strategies like those seen in Australia, the Bahamas, French Polynesia, the Maldives, the United States, and the Federated States of Micronesia. Countries with designated shark sanctuaries, for example, saw 50% more sharks compared with nations without such protections. The researchers estimate that putting protective measures in place could see a 15% increase in shark populations.\n\n\u201cAlthough our study shows substantial negative human impacts on reef shark populations, it\u2019s clear the central problem exists in the intersection between high human population densities, destructive fishing practices, and poor governance,\u201d said Demian Chapman, biologist and associate professor at Florida International University.\n\n\u201cWe found that robust shark populations can exist alongside people when those people have the will, the means, and a plan to take conservation action.\u201d\n\nGlobal demand for shark products like fins and meat has contributed to the decline of many species, and a 2014 study conducted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Shark Specialist Group found overfishing remains one of the biggest threats to sharks and rays \u2014 as many as one-quarter of species are threatened by extinction.\n\nSharks grow more slowly and produce fewer young than many other fish species, which makes them particularly vulnerable to overfishing. Destructive fishing methods like gillnets, longlines, or shark finning further contributes to their decline, according to marine conservation organization Oceana.", "lang": "en"}
