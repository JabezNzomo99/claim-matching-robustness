It featured a \u201cBreaking News\u201d social media card of ABS-CBN and the caption:\n\nSonza, in his now-deleted post, wrote as his caption that the report is an example of \u201cwhy this Network (sic) deserved its non-renewal of government franchise which expires today.\u201d\n\nSonza\u2019s post drew various reactions from netizens who shared and commented on it, with some asking whether ABS-CBN \u201chas editors or proofreaders,\u201d and others asking in disbelief if it was real.\n\nA search through posts and tweets of ABS-CBN News\u2019s official FB and Twitter accounts shows that the photo Sonza shared was not posted by the media organization.\n\nHours after Sonza published his fake post, ABS-CBN issued an advisory saying it did not publish the graphic.\n\nIt further reminded the public to \u201cread reports from legitimate news accounts\u201d before sharing posts online.\n\nThe spurious post surfaced shortly after the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) clarified on April 30 that the GCQ does not hold senior citizens under house arrest.\n\nIn a statement read by Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said senior citizens \u201cwho are actively working or running businesses,\u201d aside from those seeking medical attention and needing to buy food and medicines, are allowed to go out of their houses.\n\nThe clarification was announced in connection with a provision under Executive Order No. 112, which sets guidelines for the implementation of the GCQ in selected places in the country. It requires individuals younger than 21 years old and 60 years and older \u201cto remain in their residences at all times\u201d except when \u201cobtaining essential goods and services or for work permitted industries and offices.\u201d\n\nSocial media monitoring tool CrowdTangle shows that posts carrying the fake report on the GCQ guideline first made rounds online without the Breaking News card on May 3. The earliest retrievable post carrying both the fake caption and ABS-CBN\u2019s social media card was by a netizen who labeled it as \u201cgv\u201d or good vibes.\n\nThe post received mostly \u2018Haha\u2019 reactions from netizens, with commenters sarcastically agreeing that older people \u201cneed to look after senior citizens\u201d in case they end up \u201cplaying around.\u201d\n\nAs of May 5, CrowdTangle has recorded 45 FB posts by private netizens, pages, and public groups sharing or republishing the fake report, garnering an accumulated total of over 7,700 interactions. Sonza\u2019s post alone, before its deletion, got more than 3,700 reactions, 800 comments, and 600 shares.\n\nThe National Telecommunications Commission said earlier this year that it would grant ABS-CBN provisional authority allowing it to operate while awaiting the renewal of its franchise.
