You know, sanctuary cities want them. But once we started releasing them, they didn\u2019t want them. So, you know, they want them, they talk \u2014 they talk a good game. But once you start saying: \u2018Okay. Congratulations. Here are some.\u2019 And they don\u2019t want them. And they fight very hard. So, the whole sanctuary city thing is a big scam.\u201d\n\nThe attempt at political retribution raised alarm within ICE, with a top official responding that it was rife with budgetary and liability concerns, and noting that \u201cthere are PR risks as well.\u201d After the White House pressed again in February, ICE\u2019s legal department rejected the idea as inappropriate and rebuffed the administration. A White House official and a spokesman for DHS sent nearly identical statements to The Post on Thursday, indicating that the proposal is no longer under consideration. \u201cThis was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,\u201d the White House statement said.\n\nAt a campaign rally in Green Bay and in a Fox Business interview, the president claimed that immigrants were being released into sanctuary cities \u201calmost exclusively,\u201d that \u201cnow we\u2019re sending many of them to sanctuary cities,\u201d that it was his \u201csick idea\u201d and that the cities in question (none of which he named) were turning back migrants instead of receiving them.\n\nWe asked several of the biggest sanctuary jurisdictions whether the Trump administration had begun to release undocumented immigrants in their turf. \u201cWe have not seen any sort of uptick to warrant this claim,\u201d said Matthew McGrath, a spokesman for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D). \u201cBut if we did, and as the mayor has indicated, we\u2019d welcome it.\u201d A spokesman for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) told us, \u201cWe have seen nothing to indicate such actions from the Trump administration, and we are certainly not turning anyone away.\u201d\n\nPerhaps one sanctuary city on Trump\u2019s mind is Oakland, Calif. The president didn\u2019t mention it at the rally or in the interview, but he has feuded with Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) in the past and criticized her again in an April 13 tweet: \u201cSo interesting to see the Mayor of Oakland and other Sanctuary Cities NOT WANT our currently \u2018detained immigrants\u2019 after release ...\u201d\n\nIn fact, Schaaf said the opposite. \u201cMy job as a mayor is to welcome people,\u201d Schaaf told NPR in an interview the same day as Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cI don\u2019t build walls. It\u2019s our job to welcome everyone into our city, ensure their safety, ensure that their families can thrive. And that is my job no matter where those people came from or how they got there.\u201d (There\u2019s no evidence that the Trump administration has begun to release immigrants into Oakland.)\n\nTrump says Democrats oppose his idea because they don\u2019t want immigrants in their communities. But Democrats mentioned different reasons. As Schaaf put it: \u201cThis is about an outrageous abuse of power. The idea that you could use human beings, families as instruments of political payback to use public resources to exact retribution on your political enemies.\u201d As a Pelosi spokeswoman put it, \u201cUsing human beings \u2014 including little children \u2014 as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.\u201d\n\nThe undocumented immigrants who get released \u2014 those with criminal records are ineligible \u2014 are mostly children, families and asylum-seekers. They often make their way to other states and cities on their own, including those with sanctuary policies. (However, Trump said that \u201cwe\u2019re releasing them into sanctuary cities\u201d and that \u201cnow we\u2019re sending many of them to sanctuary cities,\u201d implying government action.)\n\nRuben Garcia, the founder and executive director of Annunciation House, told The Post that his shelter was at capacity and that he had asked ICE \u201cabout the possibility of the agency driving more families to Albuquerque, as well as cities as far away as Denver and Dallas, where churches and shelters have space for them.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
