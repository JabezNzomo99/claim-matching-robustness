Apart from repeatedly circulating fake news and communally charged content, there is another category of posts they regularly churn out \u2013 the tawdry, sleazy kind. While there are hundreds of such pages, Alt News made a compilation of 10 of them to show how they use misogyny to garner traffic and make big bucks.\n\nEarlier this month, Alt News reported on a fake quote attributed to Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi supporting Mandsaur rapist Irfan. Out of the several Facebook pages that shared the misinformation was \u2018NAMO\u2019. Its post attracted more than 5,000 shares. The repercussion of the viral false quote was rape threats to Chaturvedi and her daughter.\n\n\u2018NAMO\u2019 has been around since 2014 and in these past four years, it has gained a massive following of more than 4 million people. But fake news or communal/religious content is not all that the page shares. One of its posts titled \u201cThis star batsman is crazy about Aamir Khan\u2019s daughter\u2026\u201d had more than 4,500 likes at the time of writing this article. \u2018NAMO\u2019 is full of such tasteless content.\n\nCreated in 2016, Facebook page \u2018We Support Narendra Modi\u2019 has successfully gathered the support of more than 2 million people in merely two years. This is the headline of a recent post shared on the page (from a website ironically called \u2018Classy News\u2019) \u2013 \u201cArmy man comes home to surprise wife. When the wife delayed opening the door, he saw with his wife\u2026(her lover)\u201d. This is only one example among the several other sleazy posts shared by the page.\n\nFurther scrolling through the page shows that it has shared plentiful articles by classynews.co. This is what a usual article on the website looks like:\n\u2022 The article is broken down into multiple small paragraphs (and pictures), each followed by a Google ad.\n\u2022 A typical article on the website has at least 4-5 ads, mostly via Google.\n\nWebsites like Classy News have partnered with \u2018We Support Narendra Modi\u2019 (and many other such pages) to give themselves substantial exposure.\n\nAnother page named \u2018Namo\u2019 that was created as \u2018Shayar ishq and funny by Ayseha Siddiqui\u2019 in 2016, repeatedly shares obnoxious content. It recently posted an article titled \u2013 \u201cYouthfulness caught this widowed woman and she got into a relationship with a young man. It has another post titled, \u201cFive popular Bollywood actresses who don\u2019t like wearing underwear\u201d. As one keeps scrolling through the page, more such tasteless posts are shared with its 5 lakh followers.\n\nThe irony of creating a page dedicated to a Hindu religious figure and posting boorish content is hard to ignore. An example of a post shared by the Facebook page \u2018Bhakt hu Shri Ram ka\u2019 is \u2013 \u201cThese four Bollywood actresses were pregnant before marriage. You\u2019ll be shocked to know who is number 3\u201d. Another post is titled \u2013 \u201cThese girls were recording a cheap video with the room\u2019s door closed. This is what happened when the mother came inside.\u201d The 7 lakh followers of the page regularly like, share and comment on such posts.\n\nCreated on March 2017, \u2018We support India\u2019 has managed to attract more than 6 lakh followers in a little over a year. The most recent post shared by the page, at the time of writing this article, is titled \u2013 \u201cThis 36-year-old actress is crazy about Rahul Dravid. Do see her face\u201d (the featured image only shows the woman neck down). Another article shared on the page is titled \u2013 \u201cTired of wife\u2019s wrong activities, husband installs hidden camera. What he saw\u2026\u201d\n\nA former Smriti Irani fan page, \u2018Rashtra bhakt sena\u2019, like its aforementioned counterparts, has several obnoxious posts to its name. A young girl holding the Indian flag in its display picture and a female army officer adorning its cover photo should fool nobody that the page was created by a bunch of feminists.\n\nOut of its many tawdry posts is this one \u2013 \u201cThese are the things this yoga teacher does while teaching yoga. You\u2019ll be shocked if you see this.\u201d Another one its posts is titled \u2013 \u201cA girl was in bed with her lover when her husband came inside\u2026\u201d\n\nThe page has more than 12 lakh followers.\n\nAlt News had earlier reported on the workings of InsistPost.com, run by a young man named Ankit Kumar. Not only does the website regularly share articles on its Facebook page but also other many other partnered pages. A lot of its articles concentrated on the issue of sex, how to increase one\u2019s longevity in bed, why women shut their eyes during sex, and more. Most of the articles shared by its Facebook page has cropped images of women \u2013 basically, neck down till their waists and/or their legs. But men\u2019s faces are clearly shown. For instance, this article about \u201cAmitabh Bachchan\u2019s younger brother\u2019s wife\u201d has the actor\u2019s face and the woman\u2019s legs.\n\nThe page shares many such articles with its 15 lakh followers on a daily basis and in most, women\u2019s faces are only barely visible.\n\nA page that shares anything from jokes, sharayis, political propaganda, the blessings of Lord Hanuman to quotes about mothers\u2019 love, also frequently circulates sleazy posts about Sanjay Dutt\u2019s wife looking \u201cfiery hot\u201d in Singapore, what a hidden camera recorded behind the closed doors of a woman\u2019s room, what was in the leaked \u201cpersonal video\u201d of Jacqueline Fernandez, and more. The page has more than 3 lakh followers and alternates between sharing political propaganda and basest content.\n\nSince its inception two years ago, Facebook page \u2018Atal Modi\u2019 has managed to gain over 17 lakh followers. Among its articles are ones talking about the relationship between an underage student and his teacher, what a \u201cwoman in a towel\u201d did with her boyfriend, five schools in the world that teach \u201cdirty things\u201d to their students, the cute Bollywood actress who had to \u201cuse toilet on a highway\u201d, so on and so forth. Unsurprisingly, this page is also both religious and political. It regularly shares articles by a website dainiktimes.com (which also frequents many other Facebook pages mentioned above).\n\nWith a whooping follower count of over 3 million, \u2018Bar bar Modi Sarkar\u2019 influences and shapes people\u2019s minds with the posts it regularly churns out. The page, filled with fake news and communally-charged content, also has numerous trashy articles to its name. Some of its posts talk about the \u201coops\u201d moments of Bollywood actresses, the man on whose command Bollywood actresses agree to strip on camera, the unmarried woman who gave birth to the most popular Bollywood actress, and more. This page too has shared numerous articles by Dainik Times.\n\nThe aforementioned pages are only the tip of the iceberg among the hundreds of other such propaganda pages and groups active on social media. They keep their businesses running by following the similar strategy of juggling between posts praising the government and those shaming women. They collaborate with sleazy websites and Facebook pages, driving and generating enormous traffic. While this article is only a compilation that attempts to bring forth how such pages make money by pushing tasteless content, Alt News will publish more articles in this series to reveal their inner workings.", "lang": "en"}
