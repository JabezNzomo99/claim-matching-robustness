Some of these writings were eventually compiled in books like \u201cFragments\u201d and \u201cMM \u2013 Personal.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Monroe ever said or wrote this expression. A search of compilations of her writings turned up no results. It doesn\u2019t appear in her autobiography either.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation also reached out to multiple experts, none of whom thought the quote was authentic.\n\n\u201cI can tell you straight away that it is a fake quote,\u201d said Michelle Morgan, author of \u201cThe Girl: Marilyn Monroe, The Seven Year Itch, and the Birth of an Unlikely Feminist,\u201d in an email to the DCNF. \u201cMarilyn certainly did not say this or most of the quotes on the Internet.\u201d\n\nA spokesman from Marilyn Remembered, a long-time Monroe fan club, told the DCNF via email, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a misquote. The Divine Miss M (Bette Midler) actually said it.\u201d\n\nThe quote, according to the website Quote Investigator, appears to be somewhat similar to a quote from actress and singer Bette Midler.\n\nQuote Investigator reports that this early version of the saying appears in a 1980 newspaper supplement that published fan questions for celebrities together with their answers, including one asking Midler about shoe preferences.\n\n\u201cThe spike-heeled kind. They\u2019re not always easy to find,\u201d the newspaper quotes Midler as responding. \u201cI firmly believe that with the right footwear one can rule the world.\u201d\n\nNews outlets, including BuzzFeed and Elle magazine, have included the quote on lists of famous misattributions.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
