The Council on Foreign Relations estimates that more than 500 drone strikes took place during the Obama administration alone, with most targeting Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia.\n\nA viral image of a screen grabbed tweet alleges that Obama ordered a deadly drone strike on an Afghan wedding in Wech Baghtu. The original tweet, which has more than 2,900 likes, uses the alleged Obama-era strike to justify President Donald Trump\u2019s ordering of the drone strike that killed top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember when Obama droned a wedding in Wech Baghtu Afghanistan to take out some low level insurgents, killing 23 children, 10 women and wounding 27 others, not a damn word from congress,\u201d states the tweet. \u201c#Soleimani is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US troops, so STFU.\u201d\n\nHowever, the post gets the administration wrong. The airstrike, which occurred on Nov. 3, 2008, actually happened during the Bush administration, according to The New York Times. It\u2019s unclear whether a drone carried out the airstrike, but it did kill 33 women and children, reported NBC News.\n\nObama didn\u2019t take office until Jan. 20, 2009, more than two months after that strike took place.

That Obama-era drone strike killed at least 13 people, including the groom\u2019s son, according to The Washington Post.", "lang": "en"}
