The posts below are from 2016.\n\nAlt News also found articles on the internet which stated the same.\n\nUsers of the Alt News app requested us to verify this claim.\n\nThere are two aspects to this claim- the narrative itself and the photograph accompanying it.\n\nBHAGAVAD GITA NOT COMPULSORY IN THE NETHERLANDS\n\nIt is utterly false that the Netherlands has made the Bhagavad Gita compulsory in schools. The list of mandatory subjects for primary education in the Netherlands is readily available on the website of the Government of Netherlands. Compulsory subjects include Dutch, English, arithmetic and mathematics, social and environmental studies, creative expression, and sport and movement. There is no reference to the Bhagavad Gita as a compulsory subject/module for primary education in the Netherlands.\n\nAlt News reverse-searched the photograph of the two young girls which has been circulated along with the claim, and found that it had been uploaded in September 2013 on a website, Iskcon Mind Tree. It may be noted that ISKCON is a cult of Krishna followers.\n\nIt may be stated that the social media claim about the Netherlands making the Bhagavad Gita compulsory in schools is a hoax, and has been posted on websites and circulated on various social media platforms since at least 2016.", "lang": "en"}
