The still comes from a video of protesters burning an American flag.\n\nSince George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis police custody, protests have occurred in Portland, according to local ABC affiliate KATU. There have been instances of violence, arson and vandalism during some of the demonstrations, CNN reported.\n\nThe image being shared allegedly shows antifa activists in Portland burning a cross on Aug. 1, with the caption saying, \u201cAntifa burning crosses in Portland last night\u2026.. Where have we seen this before?\u201d (RELATED: Image Claims To Show Website For Hiring Professional Protesters)\n\nBut the image appears to be a photoshopped still from a video. Scriberr News co-founder Kalen D\u2019Almeida tweeted the original footage of protesters burning an American flag near Portland\u2019s Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse, where many protests have been focused. A statue in the plaza across the street from the federal courthouse is visible in the background of both the still and D\u2019Almeida\u2019s video.\n\nIn the edited still, the bottom of the burning flag can be seen beneath the yellow lines forming the photoshopped cross. Lead Stories reported that the cross was made using the \u201ccolor dodge\u201d effect.\n\n\u201cI am aware that someone took a still from my video and poorly edited it to look like a cross was burning,\u201d D\u2019Almeida told Check Your Fact in a Twitter direct message. \u201cNot true.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
