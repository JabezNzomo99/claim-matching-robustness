But a recent Facebook post that\u2019s being shared widely claims the current veep, Mike Pence, refuses to debate Sen. Kamala Harris, whom Joe Biden recently named as his running mate.\n\n\"Pence said he won\u2019t debate Kamala!\" the post says.\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any evidence that Pence said he wouldn\u2019t debate Harris.\n\nRather, on Aug. 11, Fox News reported that Pence indicated at a rally in Arizona that day that he was eager to debate the California senator.\n\n\"My message to the Democratic nominee for vice president: Congratulations,\" he said. \"I\u2019ll see you in Salt Lake City.\"\n\nA couple days later, Pence doubled down on this sentiment during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\n\"I think she is a skilled debater,\" Pence said, \"but I can\u2019t wait to get to Salt Lake and be on the stage with her.\"\n\nIn 2002, Pence told the Hill that he \"never eats alone with a woman other than his wife,\" leading Harris in 2019 to criticize him for limiting one-on-one meetings with women. After Biden tapped Harris as his running mate, a satirical story was shared on social media that said Pence demanded an \"on-stage chaperone\" for the vice presidential debate.\n\nBut this story is fiction.", "lang": "en"}
