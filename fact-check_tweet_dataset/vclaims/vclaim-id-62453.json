We have found out that the Third Central Pay Commission, which came in 1973, actually increased pensions instead of decreasing them. Moreover, FM Manekshaw\u2019s pension was never withheld, but was paid out, along with a special pay accorded to all marshals of the armed forces by the Fourth Central Pay Commission. FM Manekshaw\u2019s kin has also denied the claim that his pensions were ever withheld post the 1971 war and only given to him on his deathbed. His daughter, Maja Daruwala, clarified he was paid a pension \"but since a field marshal never retires, his full pay and benefits were due, and this was given to him after President Abdul Kalam's intervention.\"\n\nArya was speaking on a debate which was titled \u201cRahul\u2019s Pro China Line Angers Veterans\u201d and made these two claims, slamming Congress, while talking about India\u2019s victory in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation war. #VeteransSlamCong | Let's speak about 1971 war, there is no doubt that was the Indian Army's greatest victory and Indira Gandhi was the PM. But what happened after? The Army's pensions were slashed: @majorgauravarya - Consulting Editor, Strategic Affairshttps://t.co/jghcajZuXf pic.twitter.com/Od0v2z3oNS \u2014 Republic (@republic) June 10, 2020 Let\u2019s take a look at the claims Arya makes. Arya claimed that after the 1971 war, the pensions of the armed forces \u2013 the army, the navy and the air force \u2013 were slashed, bringing about the One Rank One Pension (OROP) \u2018problem\u2019, which happened in 1973. But there is no truth in this. Several people on Twitter, among them advocate and author Major Navdeep Singh, called Arya\u2019s claims out as baseless. It's also falsehood that FM Manekshaw's pension was reduced. He was very much paid his full pension. As a goodwill gesture it was decided to pay him pay instead of pension with retrospective effect close to his death. A tribute on the ground that an FM never retires. @ChandrusWeb \u2014 Navdeep Singh (@SinghNavdeep) June 11, 2020 Further, we delved into the Third Central Pay Commission to prove that Arya was making a completely baseless claim and found that the Third CPC, which came in 1973, actually increased pensions of the armed forces. Below is a photo of Table IV given in the Third CPC, which shows the changing pensions of the armed forces from 1953 to 1961, as well as the changes which took effect after the introduction of the Death-cum Retirement Gratuity (DCR Gratuity) Scheme for Servicemen in September 1970. These are the existing pensions before the Third CPC came in.\n\nAs can be seen below in Table V, the pensions (after the provision of DCR Gratuity) proposed by the Third CPC for the same ranks saw a marked increase. For example, for a Captain, the pension per month went from Rs 377 to Rs 500, for a Colonel it increased from Rs 638 to Rs 850 and for a General it went from Rs 840 to Rs 1,150. Apart from the increase in actual pensions, the Third CPC also proposed an increase in the retirement gratuity. Additionally, the Third CPC also added weightages in years of service to all ranks up to Brigadier to make up for the difference between actual service rendered on date of retirement and 33 years of service. This weightage of additional years was to be added to not the actual period of service rendered, but the minimum period prescribed for earning the pension of the rank. Therefore, it is quite clear that there was no slashing of the pensions of the armed forces as Arya claimed in the debate on Republic TV. There are claims that arise from time to time that say that the Third CPC raised the civilian's pension from 33 percent to 50 percent and reduced the army pension from 70 percent to 50 percent. This is a misrepresentation of facts.\n\nThe truth is that the Fourth CPC (1986) recommended that since the Parliament decided that pensions of judges of high courts and Supreme Court would be 50 percent of the last pay drawn (as per the high court & Supreme Court Judges Salaries Act 1986), the pensions of all central government employees including defence forces should be fixed at 50 percent of the last pay drawn. Sam Manekshaw, as the field marshal was popularly known as, was the Chief of Army Staff during the Bangladesh Liberation War, guiding India to a resounding victory. He was also the first Indian Army officer to be promoted to the rank of field marshal on 1 January 1973, a fortnight before he officially retired. But was he denied his pension till he was on his deathbed? Again, not true. What is important to note here is that the rank of field marshal means that one remains in active service till death. Sam Manekshaw retired as a field marshal, which means that he was entitled to full pay till his death, as the rule is now. However, it appears that the government back then was unable to take a decision on this till 2007. Till this point, FM Manekshaw received a pension, which was revised with every pay commission that came in. It was only in 2007 that the government decided that all surviving marshals of the armed forces would receive a salary equivalent to that of service chiefs and not a pension.\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t retired and you\u2019re still in active service, you can\u2019t be getting a pension,\u201d Air Marshal SY Savur (Retd.) told The Quint. According to him, FM Manekshaw would have been getting 50 percent of his last pay drawn as pension till the government took the decision in 2007. A PTI report from April 2007 states that an official statement of the defence ministry said that FM Manekshaw and Marshal of IAF Arjan Singh would be entitled to \u201cfull salary and allowances equivalent to that for serving chiefs of the two services.\u201d The two marshals had only been receiving a pension till then, the report further states. Soon after this announcement, a cheque of over Rs 1.16 crore with Manekshaw's arrears, dating from 1 January 1973, was handed over to him, while he was in the hospital, another PTI report from April 2007 states. The cheque was handed over to Manekshaw by then Defence Secretary Shekhar Dutt at the military hospital at Wellington in Tamil Nadu, where Manekshaw was admitted and passed away a year later. FM Manekshaw\u2019s family also confirmed to The Quint that FM Manekshaw, was in fact receiving his pensions. \u201cHe was getting a pension,\u201d the late field marshal\u2019s daughter Maja Daruwala said. She also recounted an incident when then President Abdul Kalam visited the ailing Manekshaw in hospital, when the latter asked him why it was that if he was not retired, he was still getting a pension. It was after this conversation that the field marshal was given his arrears dating from 1973, along with other accoutrements fit for an officer of his rank. \u201cI supposed what they were giving him was his pension and then they must have calculated his back pay, whatever it was and then gave him a lump sum,\u201d Daruwala added, speaking to The Quint.", "lang": "en"}
