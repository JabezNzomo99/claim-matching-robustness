He kept his word to the NRA. He voted against the Brady Bill five times,\" Clinton said during the April 14 Democratic primary debate in New York.\n\nShe\u2019s right about his votes against background checks and waiting periods, which took place from 1991 to 1993. But what about her attack that Sanders has consistently supported the gun lobby?\n\nThat\u2019s a lot less accurate. Sanders has a mixed record when it comes to bills on guns and has actually received low marks from the National Rifle Association over his decades-long legislative career.\n\nIn addition to Sanders\u2019 Brady Bill votes, the Clinton campaign referred us to Sanders\u2019 votes against funding for gun research, twice for prohibiting lawsuits against firearms manufacturers (\"what the head of the NRA called the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in the last 20 years,\" said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin), for increasing the burden of proof to prosecute law-breaking gun dealers, and for allowing firearms on Amtrak trains and in national parks.\n\nSchwerin also noted that Sanders voted for an amendment in the Brady Bill that allows prospective gun owners to buy a firearm if their background checks are not completed in three days. This is the amendment that facilitated Dylann Roof to purchase his .45 caliber Glock pistol, which he used to kill nine people in a historically black church in Charleston in 2015.\n\nBut on the flip side, Sanders also voted against the NRA\u2019s wishes and in favor of banning assault weapons, closing the gun show loophole, regulating high capacity magazines, and expanding background checks in the wake of the Newtown elementary school massacre.\n\nWe pulled together his votes on key gun bills over his 25 years in Congress (votes in bold reflect a pro-gun position):\n\nNeither a \u2018gun-lobby lapdog\u2019 nor an \u2018anti-gunner\u2019\n\nThe Clinton campaign also noted that the NRA helped elect Sanders to the House of Representatives in 1990. While it\u2019s true that Sanders and the gun lobby were on the same side in that election, their alignment was temporary.\n\nThe NRA backed Republican incumbent Peter Smith in his 1988 race against Sanders. But Smith didn\u2019t stick to his guns and came out in favor of an assault weapons ban after he won.\n\nFeeling betrayed, the gun group spent $18,000 attacking the incumbent in 1990 and issued bumper stickers emblazoned with images of Smith as Pinocchio and \"Dump Pete Smith,\" Garrison Nelson, a professor of state politics at the University of Vermont previously told PolitiFact.\n\nPaul Blackman, a former NRA research associate, told us in 2015 that while Sanders wasn\u2019t exactly pro-gun and the NRA wasn\u2019t explicitly pro-Sanders, he seemed like the lesser of two evils.\n\n\"I don't remember whether we ever made a pro-Sanders statement, but we certainly made it clear that Vermonters should vote against Rep. Smith, and everyone understood that to mean we were supporting, directly or indirectly, the election of Sanders,\" he said. \"Our people were satisfied that he was less bad than -- not equally bad as -- Smith.\"\n\n\"It was an awkward situation for Bernie. Sort of like the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont AP bureau chief. \"The NRA did not campaign for him but Bernie did oppose the Brady Bill. ... I do believe that Bernie \u2018owed\u2019 the NRA when he first went to Congress.\"\n\nSince 1990, however, Sanders and the NRA seemed to part ways. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross said Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since his first days in Congress, adding he isn\u2019t a \"gun lobby lapdog.\"\n\nBlackman, the former NRA researcher, said the group doesn\u2019t consider Sanders \"an anti-gunner.\"\n\nWarren Gunnels, Sanders\u2019 policy director, noted that Sanders\u2019 latest grade from the NRA was a D. In fact, Sanders has earned failing grades from the NRA for the past two decades. His highest mark was a C-, a barely passing grade that doesn\u2019t amount to full-throated support. (The group has not graded Sanders in 2016.)\n\nClinton said Sanders \"has been largely a very reliable supporter of the NRA.\"\n\nThis is a stretch. Sanders won his congressional bid about 25 years ago thanks at least in part to the NRA, and has voted against major pieces of gun control legislation. However, he has also cast votes for gun control and has received low marks from the NRA for the past 20 years.\n\nNeither the gun lobby nor gun control advocates claim Sanders as their own.", "lang": "en"}
