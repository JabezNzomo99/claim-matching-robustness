Despite promising to call PolitiFact back, no one did. And we could find no independent verification.\n\nWe did find something funny: Turns out the NRA endorsed a Romney for public office, just not Mitt.\n\nRonna Romney, divorced from Gov. Romney's brother Scott, earned the NRA's support in 1996 as she campaigned for a U.S. Senate seat representing Michigan. She won the primary, but lost to incumbent Sen. Carl Levin.\n\nMaybe that's why Mitt was confused. At least he admits it's False.", "lang": "en"}
