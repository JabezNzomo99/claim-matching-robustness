{"title": "FALSE: UP, PUP require joining rallies for graduation", "subtitle": "No official document from the two universities requires students to participate in rallies", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Aug 25, 2020 5:11 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-79889", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/up-pup-require-joining-rallies-graduation", "vclaim": "Students from the University of the Philippines (UP) and Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) are required to attend rallies to graduate, according to self-professed ex-rebel Alvin Turero.\n\nThis post first put up a year ago went viral again this August 2020. Facebook page Huwag Tularan originally posted on August 15, 2019 a quote card containing the statement of Turero, who claimed he was involved with the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army (CPP-NPA) and the Kabataan Partylist in the provinces of Laguna and Quezon around 2012. He also said he served as secretary-general of Anakpawis Laguna.\n\nTurero's supposed membership in Kabataan Partylist and affiliation with its chapters in Laguna and Quezon Province were denied on Monday, August 24. Official statements released reiterated that no Alvin Turero has ever been involved with their organization.\n\nThe post from the Huwag Tularan Facebook page had a caption and quote card that read, \u201c\u2018Sa UP kasi at sa PUP, hindi ka naman pwede grumaduate ng hindi ka sumasali sa rally (In UP and PUP, you cannot graduate without joining rallies).\u2019 - Alvin Turero, Former Rebel.\u201d\n\nTurero first made this doubtful claim during a Senate hearing on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs on August 14, 2019. Turero's claim was prompted by a question from administration senator Bong Go on how progressive organizations recruit university students in cities.\n\nNo official document from the two universities confirms or corroborates Tureros' claim. The universities do not require students to participate in rallies or mobilizations for any cause, and university officials warn against this practice.\n\nTurero also mentioned UP Los Ba\u00f1os during the Senate hearing, but there is no provision in the UP Los Ba\u00f1os Student Handbook or the UP Los Ba\u00f1os Faculty Manual that requires student attendance in rallies.\n\nStudent handbooks of other UP campuses such as Diliman, Manila, Cebu, and Open University also do not mention joining rallies as a graduation requirement. The same goes for the PUP System Student Handbook.\n\nIn the same 2019 hearing where Turero appeared, then-PUP President Emanuel de Guzman said that the university monitors and warns their professors against such practice. \"Nagpalabas na rin po kami ng memorandum noon pa na bawal magpalahok ng mga estudyante sa mga rally, lalo na kung ito ay may kapalit na grade. At hindi rin po namin kinukunsinti 'yung ginagawa ng mga guro na ito,\" De Guzman said.\n\n(We had released a memorandum a while back to prohibit requiring students to join rallies, especially if this is in exchange for some grade component. We do not condone teachers doing this.) \u2013 Rianna Cruz/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
