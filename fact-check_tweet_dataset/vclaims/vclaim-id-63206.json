But Schwartz followed up on March 15, 2020, by thanking the experts quoted in the article, who themselves raised the alarm that the actions of U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration regarding pandemic preparedness left the United States vulnerable:\n\n \n\n The people tagged in Schwartz\u2019 tweet are global health and development advocate Carolyn Reynolds; Jeremy Konyndyk, who led foreign disaster assistance for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under President Barack Obama; and Luciana Borio, former director for the National Security Council\u2019s Medical and Biodefense Preparedness under Trump.\n\nThose three were quoted in the Post\u2019s 2018 report in the following passage:\n\nThis week, the administration released a list of $15 billion in spending cuts it wants Congress to approve. Among the targets is $252 million in unused funds remaining from the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people, far exceeding the combined total cases reported in about 20 previous outbreaks since the 1970s. The White House proposal \u201cis threatening to claw back funding whose precise purpose is to help the United States be able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis,\u201d said Carolyn Reynolds, a vice president at PATH, a global health technology nonprofit. Collectively, warns Jeremy Konyndyk, who led foreign disaster assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Obama administration, \u201cWhat this all adds up to is a potentially really concerning rollback of progress on U.S. health security preparedness.\u201d \u201cIt seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over the last 15 years,\u201d said Konyndyk, now a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. \u201cThese moves make us materially less safe. It\u2019s inexplicable.\u201d The day before news of [Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense Timothy] Ziemer\u2019s exit became public, one of the officials on his team, Luciana Borio, director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the NSC, spoke at a symposium at Emory University to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic. That event killed an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide. \u201cThe threat of pandemic flu is the number one health security concern,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cAre we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
