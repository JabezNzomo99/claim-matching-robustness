The viral image is from October 2015 when a Dalit family of five stripped in a town in UP\u2019s Gautam Buddh Nagar district to protest against alleged police inaction on a complaint.\n\nFacebook page Good morning God\u2019 shared the misleading post on Friday. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nA simple reverse search revealed the truth behind the viral photo. We found many old media reports regarding the incident. According to Zee News, the Dalit family resorted to a nude protest after Greater Noida Police refused to register an FIR for an alleged robbery despite repeated requests. According to reports, one of the family members was called Sunil Gautam.\n\nHowever, contrary to this, some reports claim Greater Noida Police allegedly stripped the family naked for attempting to file a complaint.\n\nSome news reports carry the uncropped version of the viral photo. The video of the incident had spread like wildfire at that time.\n\nThe misleading claim went viral in February last year too. At that time, some media outlets had debunked the claim.", "lang": "en"}
