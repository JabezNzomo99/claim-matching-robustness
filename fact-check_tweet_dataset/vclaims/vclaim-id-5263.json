{"title": "Antifa Crackdown a Proposal, Not Law", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.factcheck.org", "date": "2018-07-18T15:38:51+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-5263", "url": "https://www.factcheck.org/2018/07/antifa-crackdown-a-proposal-not-law/", "vclaim": "Q: Is joining antifa now illegal and \u201cpunishable by 15 years in prison\u201d?\n\n\n\nA: No. A headline on a website known for distorting news incorrectly describes a House bill. It has not become law and it would not make joining antifa illegal.\n\nLegislation introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in recent weeks would crack down on the aggressive activities associated with the group antifa \u2014 a loosely organized network of \u201canti-fascists.\u201d But there has been no action on the bill since its June 8 introduction.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the false headline on the website neonnettle.com, which has repeatedly published stories that distort the facts. In this case, it inaccurately describes the proposal as a law, claiming: \u201cJoining \u2018Soros Funded\u2019 Antifa Is Now Illegal, Punishable By 15 Years In Prison.\u201d\n\nThe headline also misrepresents what it would do. If it became law, the bill wouldn\u2019t make \u201cjoining\u201d the group \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nBeyond the headline, the July 12 story goes on to accurately refer to the legislation \u2014 called the Unmasking Antifa Act of 2018 \u2014 as a bill, not a law, and correctly quotes excerpts from the bill.\n\nThe legislation, introduced by New York Republican Rep. Daniel M. Donovan Jr., would punish any individual \u201cin disguise, including while wearing a mask\u201d who \u201cinjures, oppresses, threatens, or intimidates\u201d any person that is exercising \u201cany right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d They would be fined, imprisoned for up to 15 years, or both.\n\nAntifa members sometimes wear masks during demonstrations and are known for employing aggressive tactics. While there is no official leadership, those who identify with the group often combat racism and have denounced capitalism. They have confronted far-right groups in the streets, like at the 2017 rally of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia. Some have dubbed the group the \u201cviolent left.\u201d\n\nBut nothing claimed in the headline on neonnettle.com has happened. The bill is still awaiting a hearing by the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nCorrection, July 21: Our original story misstated the maximum possible prison sentence. We updated the story to say the proposed bill carries a penalty of up to 15 years.\n\nUpdate, April 29, 2019: Months after our story was published, neonnettle.com posted a correction to its article noting, in part, that \u201ca previous version of this article stated that joining Antifa had been made illegal but this is incorrect. The bill was proposed but never made law and the measure was aimed at cracking down on the aggressive activities associated with the group Antifa, but not joining it.\u201d The story\u2019s false headline, however, remains intact \u2014 which the site\u2019s director said is due to technical issues.\n\nUpdate, May 23, 2019: Nearly a year after posting its story, Neonnettle.com updated the headline, which now reads, \u201cBill Proposes Crackdown on Activities Associated with Antifa.\u201d We should note, however, that the story is now outdated. The bill in question expired at the end of the 115th Congress, and has not been reintroduced. Its sponsor, New York Rep. Dan Donovan, lost reelection in 2018.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nHayden, Michael Edison. \u201cExplaining antifa protests in the wake of Charlottesville.\u201d ABC News. 24 Aug 2017.\n\nNewton, Daniel. \u201cJoining \u2018Soros Funded\u2019 Antifa Is Now Illegal, Punishable By 15 Years In Prison.\u201d Neonnettle.com. 12 Jul 2018.\n\nStanglin, Doug. \u201cWhat is antifa and what does the movement want?\u201d USA Today. 23 Aug 2017.\n\nU.S. House. \u201cH.R.6054, Unmasking Antifa Act of 2018.\u201d (as introduced 8 Jun 2018.)", "lang": "en"}
