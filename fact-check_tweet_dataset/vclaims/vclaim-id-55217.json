A spokesman for Clinton confirmed she never made the comment about taking \u201chalf of DC\u201d with her.\n\nThe claim that the former secretary of state made the statement has been circulating on social media since at least 2018, with this particular post saying, \u201cOkay. Your terms are acceptable. Can we get it in writing??\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no record of Clinton ever actually saying or writing the words attributed to her in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible media reports of her making the statement. Searching her books and verified social media accounts didn\u2019t turn up any matches either.\n\nNick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton, confirmed to the Caller in an email that she never made the remark. She has never been publicly indicted on any charge.

In April 2019, a meme falsely credited her with referring to Democratic voters as \u201cstupid\u201d and manipulatable.", "lang": "en"}
