Avella and the show\u2019s hosts were discussing new \u201cperson first\u201d guidelines adopted by San Francisco legislators, would eliminate words like \u201cfelon,\u201d \u201coffender,\u201d \u201cconvict,\u201d \u201caddict\u201d and \u201cjuvenile delinquent,\u201d per the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, what was once called a convicted felon or an offender released from jail will be a \u2018formerly incarcerated person,\u2019 or a \u2018justice-involved\u2019 person or simply a \u2018returning resident,\u201d the Chronicle reported.\n\nAvella wasn\u2019t a fan of that idea. \u201cAnd the focus ought to be on a society that follows the law, not allowing people to defecate in the streets, not allowing individuals to lay on the street having just shot up with marijuana,\u201d he said. The hosts immediately interjected with the word \u201cheroin,\u201d and Avella quickly corrected his statement.\n\nMarijuana is not a substance that is injected. It is either smoked or consumed. The digital media and entertainment publication Mashable explained that the idea of injecting weed \u201cis a long-running joke to refer to those so out of the loop, they have no idea how consuming marijuana works.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
