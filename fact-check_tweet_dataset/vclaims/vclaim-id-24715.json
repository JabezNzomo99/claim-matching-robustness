The quote does not appear in a selection of works by and about Churchill.\n\nRichard Langworth, a senior fellow at the Hillsdale College Churchill Project, lists the quote on his page of \u201cAll the \u2018Quotes\u2019 Winston Churchill Never Said.\u201d\n\nWhile this saying cannot be attributed to Churchill, the British statesman was both fascinated by and a critic of Islam, expressing admiration for the bravery of Muslims, but condemnation for the religion itself.\n\n\u201cIndividual Moslems may show splendid qualities. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen; all know how to die; but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith,\u201d Churchill wrote in \u201cThe River War.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
