The pride it brings is immense. World bows before the greatest leader. @narendramodi #BestQuotesOfModi.\"\n\nThe post was retweeted more than 450 times and liked by about 1,000 users at the last count.\n\nAnother Twitter user 'Chowkidar Khushboo Sharma' has also tweeted the same video with the same claim.\n\nWe first searched on the internet using keywords \"Indian PM given a standing ovation in US Congress\". We found that six Indian prime ministers have delivered a speech to the joint sessions or joint meetings of the US Congress so far.\n\nThey are Jawaharlal Nehru (1949), Rajiv Gandhi (1985), PV Narasimha Rao (1994), Atal Bihari Vajpayee (2000), Manmohan Singh (2005) and Narendra Modi (2016).\n\nEach of them received a standing ovation when they entered Congress and took to the podium to deliver their speech as well as towards the end of their address.\n\nHowever, PM Modi did have the rare honour of getting nine standing ovations and 33 applauses during his 48-minute-long speech. Many prominent media houses had reported about his popularity in the US at that time.\n\nPrior to PM Modi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had been cheered 32 times during his 40-minute-long speech at the joint session of US Congress in 2005.\n\nA news report on the event can be read here.", "lang": "en"}
