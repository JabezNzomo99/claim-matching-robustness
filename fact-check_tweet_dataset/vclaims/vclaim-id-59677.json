{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did Jim Carrey Say, \u2018Hollywood Elites Eat Whole Babies For Christmas\u2019?", "subtitle": "", "author": "checkyourfact.com", "date": "2020-07-27T23:53:33.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-59677", "url": "http://checkyourfact.com/2020/07/27/fact-check-jim-carrey-hollywood-babies-christmas/", "vclaim": "An article shared on Facebook claims actor Jim Carrey said, \u201cHollywood elites eat whole babies for Christmas.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Carrey ever made the statements attributed to him in the article.\n\nIn May, a 2018 article published by the website Jasper and Sardine has resurfaced in QAnon Facebook groups. The article alleges that Carrey, an actor known for roles in films such as \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d and \u201cBruce Almighty,\u201d told an audience during a question-and-answer session at a screening for the 2017 documentary \u201cJim & Andy: The Great Beyond\u201d that \u201cHollywood elites eat whole babies for Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people believe the more the child has suffered, the better it tastes,\u201d Carrey is quoted as saying in the article. \u201cThey believe the negative emotions coursing through the kid\u2019s body, the adrenaline and hatred, will give them special powers. It\u2019s a Hollywood thing influenced by old school satanism.\u201d\n\nBut there is no evidence Carrey said the quotes attributed to him in the Jasper and Sardine article. While the actor did make appearances to promote the 2017 documentary, no credible media outlets have reported about him making such comments. Nor is there any record of him saying it elsewhere.

YourNewsWire, where the article was also posted in 2017, has been fact-checked at least 80 times, according to Poynter. Sean Adl-Tabatabai, the editor-in-chief of NewsPunch, told Lead Stories that the article has been \u201cunpublished.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we moved domains to NewsPunch.com in 2019, stories like this no longer adhered to our new editorial standards. Specifically there was no proof that Jim Carrey made any of the claims alleged in the article,\u201d he told Lead Stories. \u201cThis article was one of many that got unpublished at some point after we moved domains.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d actor has been the subject of misattributed comments. In August 2019, Check Your Fact debunked a viral meme that claimed he said, \u201cSociety is collapsing.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
