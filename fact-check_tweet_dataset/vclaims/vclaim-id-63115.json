He reiterated the claim during his vice presidential debate with Kamala Harris on October 7. It should be noted that the United States began allowing more flights from China as of June.\n\nIn an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence made a now-familiar claim that President Trump has shut down travel from China.\n\n\"We've been from the very beginning, when the President suspended all travel from China and stood up the White House coronavirus task force in January, we have been hoping for the best but planning for the worst, and that's been being worked out every single day,\u201d said the vice president.\n\nIn a Fox News town hall on March 24, Trump said: \u201cI made a decision to close off [the U.S.] to China that was weeks early.\u201d\n\nIn the same town hall, Trump said: \u201cI made the early decision with China, so I already closed [the country] off to China.\u201d\n\nThe day before the town hall, the president tweeted the claim, this time including Europe:\n\nAnd during an earlier Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on March 5, President Trump said he \u201cclosed down the borders to China and to other areas that are very badly affected.\u201d He also referred to a \u201ctravel ban\u201d on China during an interview with Sean Hannity on March 4.\n\nWhat to make of these claims?\n\nThe president has not, as Pence claimed, \u201csuspended all travel from China.\u201d There is no \u201ctravel ban\u201d from China. And even today, travel from China to the United States continues for Americans and some foreign citizens.\n\nThe Trump administration first restricted some travel from China to the United States two months ago. On January 31, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar announced that \u201cforeign nationals, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States for this time.\u201d\n\nOn March 11, the administration imposed restrictions on travel from most European countries. \u201cTo keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,\u201d the president said in a speech from the Oval Office.\n\nThat claim wasn\u2019t quite right. After his remarks, the administration clarified that, as with China, the travel suspension only applied only to some non-Americans. The new rules have led to a substantial reduction in the number of travelers from the affected countries and the restrictions have earned the praise of some experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, who credits them with helping limit the spread of the virus in the U.S.\n\nBut travel from China and Europe, and many other countries for that matter, continues to this day. Here\u2019s how the CDC puts it: \u201cAmerican citizens, lawful permanent residents, and their families who have been in one of the countries listed below [China, Iran, Europe, the U.K., and Ireland] in the past 14 days will be allowed to enter the United States,\u201d though they\u2019re required to pass through one of 13 airports for screening.\n\n\u201cThat means that Americans \u2014 just as capable as carrying and transmitting a contagious viral infection as foreigners \u2014 had free passage between China and the U.S. And so daily flights between China and the U.S. continued,\" wrote Ethan Epstein of the Washington Times, who has been reporting on the travel restrictions for weeks.*\n\nSeveral major airlines, including Delta, American, and United, have suspended flights from the U.S. to China until at least April. However, some airlines have maintained flights from China into the United States. For example, a representative from Los Angeles International Airport confirmed to The Dispatch that Air China has six weekly flights from Beijing to LAX, just one of four airlines that has continued service between China and Los Angeles at the airport since the restrictions were announced. Other major airports also have flights between China and the U.S.: Among today\u2019s departures, JFK International\u2019s website lists flights to Hong Kong with American Airlines and Malaysia Airlines and a flight to Shanghai through Air China. Chicago O\u2019Hare\u2019s arrivals this week include flights on United from Shanghai on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nHere is a video of an Air China flight approaching LAX at approximately 3 p.m. PT on Saturday:\n\nTravelers who display signs of coronavirus are tested and quarantined upon re-entry to the U.S., while others from certain countries are asked to self-quarantine for 14 days. There have been instances of medical screeners testing positive for the virus after exposure and experts say this basic screening may miss a majority of cases.\n\nPence and Trump are correct that the president made an early decision with China. But it\u2019s not accurate to say that Trump \u201csuspended all travel from China\u201d or otherwise closed off travel from China.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
