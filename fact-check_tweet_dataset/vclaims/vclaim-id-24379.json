But a month later Ayade bemoaned the state\u2019s security challenges.\n\n\u201cThis once peaceful, beautiful state suddenly became a safe haven for militants and kidnappers,\u201d he\n\nWe beamed a searchlight on the governor\u2019s two claims.\n\nNakanya Iyadim, information officer in the state\u2019s communication\u2019s ministry, confirmed to Africa Check that the governor did make the claims.\n\nHowever the governor\u2019s office did not respond to our queries about the source of the statistics.\n\nThe best source to check this claim is the\n\ncompiled by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Dr Isiaka Olarewaju, director of household statistics at the bureau, told Africa Check.\n\nBut he said the NBS data \u201cis as reported\u201d. There could be unreported crimes, Olarewaju added. Under-reporting is often an issue.\n\n\u201cThe way Nigeria police operates, most times there is little or no care for the victim of crime. It's not very easy to report crime in Nigeria and many incidents go unreported,\u201d Ekhomu said.\n\nthe perception that the authorities will not help, or because of the nature of the crime, such as sexual assault.\n\nThe statistics office aggregates data on incidences of crime reported to the police in each of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, the area around the capital Abuja. It has three categories for this:\n\u2022 None Offences against people, such as murder, manslaughter, infanticide and rape.\n\u2022 None Offences against properties, such as stealing, receiving stolen goods, obtaining property by false pretence, robbery and burglary.\n\u2022 None Offences against lawful authority, such as the failure to pay your taxes. \n\n\n\nThe numbers tell a different story\n\non crime statistics was released in June 2018 and covers 2017.\n\nIt shows that 134,663 cases were reported to the police in Nigeria in 2017. Of these, 2,163 were reported in Cross River state working out to 1.61% of all reported cases, not 1.1% as the governor claimed.\n\nWere Ayade\u2019s claim correct, then 1,481 cases of crime would have been reported in Cross River.\n\nThe data from the National Bureau of Statistics show Lagos state had the highest number of reported cases of crime, at 50,975 or 37.9% of the total.\n\nKebbi state, in the north west, had\n\nof total cases reported, with 0.15% of the total.\n\nCross River state had 2,163 reported cases, at least 20 other states had fewer reported cases.\n\nThe governor was thus also incorrect with this claim.\n\nThe location of the state in the Niger Delta is a red flag, Wale Obydeen, the editor-in-chief of\n\n\u201cCross River cannot be the most peaceful state. Niger Delta we know is a volatile region and of course we should expect violence,\u201d he said. This is due to oil exploration in the region, and crimes particular to this such as the kidnapping of expatriates.\n\nBut context is important when comparing crime in different areas. As explained in our\n\n, comparing absolute crime numbers across regions without factoring in their populations skews comparisons.\n\nInstead, one could work out the reported cases per 100,000 people. When the category of crimes against persons is considered, Cross River\u2019s ratio is 25 reported cases per 100,000 people,\n\nout of the country\u2019s states. The state had a population of 3.9 million people in 2016.\n\nBut working this out for all categories is more difficult,\n\nDr Ona Ekhomu, the president of the\n\n, said. As such crime should be considered \u201cin their silos\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is not good to lump them together. For instance a community that has a lot of crime against property but little crime against person will be considered safer than another that has more of crime against persons,\u201d said Ekhomu.\n\nTo make it more complicated, Nigeria's population figures are\n\n, with a national census last held in 2006. The\n\nby states are from 2016 and should be used with caution.\n\nPopulation characteristics should also be considered, Ekhomu said. For example some Nigerian states are more populated but have less crime than neighbouring ones with fewer people.", "lang": "en"}
