That measure allows any immigrant living in San Francisco who is of legal voting age and is the parent, guardian or caregiver for a child under the age of 19 to vote in school board elections. Noncitizens are not permitted to vote in any other elections.\n\nThe law is in effect for the Nov. 6, 2018, school board election and will expire in 2022, unless the city\u2019s board of supervisors votes to extend it, according to the San Francisco Department of Elections.\n\nAlso, any information provided by immigrants registering to vote in school board elections will be accessible to federal agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to the elections department.\n\nSome stories circulating online have highlighted the ability of immigrants to vote, without giving equal weight to the crucial aspect that they are allowed to vote only in San Francisco school board elections.\n\nOne such story was posted on the website American Journal Review, which tells readers on its \u201cAbout\u201d page that it \u201cshould not be considered an unbiased news source, rather we publish opinions and interpretations of the day\u2019s news by Conservative and Libertarian bloggers.\u201d\n\nThat story cited an unfounded claim that 3 million votes were cast in the last presidential election by \u201cillegal aliens,\u201d an assertion that was first made by Gregg Phillips, who has advanced theories about widespread voter fraud, shortly after the 2016 presidential election and highlighted by then President-elect Donald Trump and the conspiracy theory website InfoWars. (We debunked several claims Trump has made \u2014 without evidence \u2014 about supposed voter fraud in the election. Numerous studies, including a 2014 Government Accountability Office report, have found the in-person voter fraud the president, and Phillips, alleged is virtually nonexistent.)\n\nAt the time, Phillips said that an organization called True the Vote would \u201cinitiate legal action\u201d based on his claim.\n\nHowever, True the Vote didn\u2019t pursue it, according to the organization\u2019s president, Catherine Engelbrecht.\n\nAlthough the American Journal Review story distorts the facts, it has been shared on social media pages with a combined following of more than 3 million and has been copied by at least two other dubious websites.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nNoncitizen Voting in School Board Elections \u2014 Ordinance No. 128-18.
