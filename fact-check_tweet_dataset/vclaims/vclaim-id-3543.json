This is around 11% of the total. They estimated that there were just over 400,000 male engineers.\n\nBecause of the low numbers involved, the Office for National Statistics cautions against comparing these numbers over time. But, in the same period of 2011 women made up 6% of engineers, so it\u2019s very likely the number has been on the rise.", "lang": "en"}
