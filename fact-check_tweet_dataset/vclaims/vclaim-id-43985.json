They found that it was a \u201c\n\n\u201d of both truth and falsity.\n\nThe picture does show Nigerian school girls who made a device that used urine to produce hydrogen, a gas that can be used to run a generator. The four girls\n\nto a science fair held in Nigeria in 2012.\n\ndetailing their efforts which brought them wide recognition, the girls said the choice of urine was because it was cheap and widely available.\n\nThe picture claims the device can produce six hours of electricity. But it wasn\u2019t clear what load it could carry in that period, with different photos showing it either powering simple light bulbs or a wall light and a television.\n\nHydrogen gas generators already exist, while the idea of using urine to produce electricity is\n\nthat the girls\u2019 device required more electricity than it generated, making it inefficient.\n\nThe waste product from their project was water vapour, the girls said. And coming up with a generator that emits less carbon monoxide was their main goal with the device, one of them, Adebola Duro-Aina, 15,\n\nGenerators are a common sight in Nigeria, where electricity production\n\nwith demand. In this regard, the girls\u2019 practical work was widely described as noteworthy.\n\nThe next challenge for them is to make it more efficient, and more portable, they said. \u2013", "lang": "en"}
