HFF is a secret group and does not come up on Facebook search results. You need an invitation to join it. Don\u2019t fall for fake news, click here to check out The Quint\u2019s WebQoof stories.\n\nThe group is a close-knit circuit of individuals buying and selling all sorts of things. However, amidst deals violating Facebook\u2019s terms and conditions, we stumbled upon an issue even graver \u2013 people offering to manufacture Aadhaar cards. In the screenshot below, one of the members can be seen asking others to \u201cinbox\u201d him if they want Aadhaar cards. He claims that the ID proof will be \u201c1001% working\u201d. He also makes a post offering \u201cfake Aadhaar cards for Facebook verification\u201d.\n\nAnother member claims that he has at his disposal \u201cmany\u201d PDF files of Aadhaar cards. He wishes to know at what price he will be able to sell them. One of the members advertises his stock of 100 Aadhaar cards as \u201cloot loot loot\u201d, selling them for Rs 150 each. There are also offerings of PAN cards in the group. Aadhaar Helpline: What Google Didn\u2019t Answer but Needs to\n\nThere was another Aadhaar-related demand that came to our notice \u2013 editing. In the screenshot below, one of the members is looking for someone who can edit his date of birth in his Aadhaar card. \u201cBas real lagna chahiye,\u201d he writes. \u201cI Have Not Lost\u201d & 9 Aadhaar Claims that RS Sharma Should Explain\n\nWe discovered a substantial demand for Aadhaar-related editing work for various purposes. Recently, Alt News published another story about a closed Facebook group that goes by the name \u201cSharing is Caring \u2013 Advertising Deals\u201d. Our detailed report disclosed the inner workings of its 18,000-odd members who regularly buy/sell Facebook pages, Instagram accounts and more. Help for Friends is more close-knit than Sharing is Caring (SIC) but has a lot of the same members as SIC. Just like in SIC, deals on Facebook pages dedicated to politics, army, girls, actresses and cricket and more are made on HFF too.\n\nDeals on fake Aadhar cards are not limited to HFF. We stumbled upon deals related to Aadhaar in the SIC group too. The screenshots below are from SIC. If you look closely, some of these names appear in the screenshots of HFF posted earlier in the article. However, post Alt News\u2019 story, the admins of Sharing is Caring seem to have become more vigilant about what sells in the group. One of them posted \u201cnew rules as per the need of time\u201d, which now penalise (temporarily ban) members making deals on Aadhaar cards or any government ID proof and fake government offer websites, among others. There is a reason why groups like SIC and HFF keep their status closed or secret, as the members are well aware that their dealings are often illegal. As this issue comes to light, it becomes pertinent that necessary actions are taken against these groups.", "lang": "en"}
