No, that's not true: the story was made up by a site that invents fictional stories about bizarre crimes or accidents for entertainment purposes. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on May 22, 2018 on Huzlers titled \"Prom Limo Driver Crashes Intentionally After Students Play Lil Pump's 'Gucci Gang' Via Aux Cord\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nMIAMI - Prom night ended in disaster for a group of teens in Miami after the limousine driver allegedly swerved onto oncoming traffic and crashing he vehicle. Although a major accident, the driver and all passengers, all 14 of them, walked away with no life-threatening injuries. According to students inside the vehicle, the limo driver suddenly swerved onto oncoming traffic in what seemed as an intentional suicide-like attempt to crash and kill everyone in the vehicle as soon as one of the students began playing Lil Pump's 'Gucci Gang' via aux cord.\n\nThe picture of the car crash is from a 2016 accident in which a drunk driver rammed a limousine:\n\nA Suffolk County judge dropped all criminal charges against the limousine driver whose U-Turn into an oncoming pickup truck killed four young women touring Long Island's wine country - enraging family members in court who decried the decision. \"How could you look at him and do this? He doesn't deserve it!\"\n\nThe photo of the \"driver\" is actually Brett Hollingsworth, who was beaten up by someone he was stabbing:\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: 'BBQ Becky' Did NOT Call 911 On A Black Police Officer Who Pulled Her Over\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Feminist Didn't Change Daughter's Diapers For Weeks Because She Didn't Give \"Consent\"\n\u2022 Fake News: Kanye West Did NOT Say Being Black Is A \"Choice\"; Does NOT Plan To Bleach Skin\n\u2022 Fake News: Viral Sensation \"Lil Tay\" NOT Picked Up By Los Angeles Child Protection Services\n\u2022 Fake News: Research Did NOT Show Cardi B Fans Are More Likely To Catch STDs And Cheat", "lang": "en"}
