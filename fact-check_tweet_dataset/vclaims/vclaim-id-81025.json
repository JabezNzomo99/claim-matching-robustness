Tony Evers called for a 2% pay increase for UW System employees in each fiscal year. That was less than the 3% that UW System President Ray Cross had requested.\n\nHowever, on May 28, 2019, Republicans on the Legislature's budget committee trimmed Evers\u2019 overall spending increase for the UW System by more than half. Their plan still provides an increase over current levels, but it means there will be less money available to address pay gap issues.\n\nTwo days before the vote, in a May 26, 2019, appearance on WISN\u2019s \"UpFront,\" Cross made his case for a pay increase in an interview with host Adrienne Pedersen.\n\n\"Most research shows that we are a little behind, and some areas we're behind more than others,\" he said. \"But compensation is an important piece of the total overall package to make the university part of the solution for the state.\"\n\nIs Cross right that UW salaries are lagging peer institutions?\n\nIn higher education, the term peer institution comes up a lot.\n\nIn short, it is another school -- or set of schools -- that are similar in size, performance and mission. The idea is that they provide a good comparison when it comes to salaries, benefits and other matters.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the UW System actually has a formalized list of peer institutions. It was established in 1984 by the Governor\u2019s Faculty Compensation Study Commission, which was put in place by then-Gov. Tony Earl, a Democrat.\n\nThe listing includes 11 peer institutions for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the state\u2019s flagship; 14 peers for the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, also considered a research institution; and 31 peer institutions for what are known as the \"comprehensive institutions.\"\n\nThe UW comprehensive institutions are four-year campuses in Eau Claire, Green Bay, La Crosse, Oshkosh, Platteville, River Falls, Stevens Point, Superior and Whitewater, as well as UW-Stout in Menomonie and UW-Parkside in Kenosha County.\n\nPeer institutions for UW-Madison include: Indiana University, Michigan State University, Ohio State University, Purdue University and the University of Texas-Austin.\n\nPeer institutions for UW-Milwaukee include: Cleveland University, Temple University, the University of Illinois-Chicago, the University of New Orleans and the University of Texas-Dallas.\n\nMeanwhile, peer institutions for the group of other institutions include: Minnesota State University-Mankato, Central Michigan University, Chicago State University, the University of Northern Iowa and Grand Valley State University in Michigan.\n\nWhen we asked Cross for backup, his staff pointed us to the University of Wisconsin System Accountability Dashboard. The UW System maintains the online dashboard with links to various statistical information, including a page devoted to the \"Faculty Compensation Gap.\"\n\nWhen it comes to comparisons, salaries are adjusted for the cost of living using the Economic Research Institute Index. That\u2019s good, because it helps even out the comparison. Benefits are not included. The salary information is provided by the American Association of University Professors.\n\nHow big is the lag?\n\nThe dashboard charts cover the compensation gap from 2009-2010 to 2017-2018. For 2017-2018, the charts show that UW System salaries overall lag peers by 16.48%.\n\nBreaking it down further, UW-Madison lags by 15.60%; UW-Milwaukee lags by 10.82%; and the other campuses lag by 18.99%.\n\nIn the previous academic year, 2016-2017, the compensation gap for UW System stood at 19.91%, UW-Madison at 19.15%, UW-Milwaukee at 12.67% and UW-Comprehensives at 22.65%.\n\nSo, the difference shrunk a bit from the previous year, but the gaps are all longstanding.\n\nA March 4, 2019 USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin report using 2017-\u201918 salary information found a handful of professors, mainly in the finance and economics departments, are among the highest-paid employees in the system.\n\nThose salaries tend to be higher because of the need to compete with private-sector jobs.\n\nOverall, the USA TODAY NETWORK -- Wisconsin report found that faculty members across the UW System were paid an average of 12.3% less in 2017-2018 than those at peer universities. That gap rose to 16.5% when adjusted for cost of living.\n\nThat matches what the UW System found in its own analysis.\n\nMeanwhile, an analysis by a UW-Madison senior policy analyst released April 11, 2018, found that UW-Madison average salaries were ranked 12th among its peers for full professors, 7th for associate professors and 9th for assistant professors.\n\nCross said \"Most research shows that (UW salaries) are a little behind, and (in) some areas we're behind more than others.\"\n\nThe peer institutions Cross was referring to have been well established.\n\nAnd the salary numbers show he is on target, even when cost-of-living differences between various states and cities are factored in.", "lang": "en"}
