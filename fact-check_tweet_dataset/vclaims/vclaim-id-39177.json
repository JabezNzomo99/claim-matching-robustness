While this crude rumor was unbelievable, it was accompanied by a set of manipulated images which appeared to show a Snopes article had rated the claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign did not bury a dog on stage during a rally and Snopes did not publish an article verifying that he did. This rumor and fact check were made up out of whole cloth.\n\nA reverse image search via TinEye showed that the photograph of the dog was originally published in 2015. The photograph shows a dog that was rescued in Russia after it was accidentally buried beneath pavement.\n\nAnother reason to be suspicious of the veracity of these Tumblr images is that they were shared without a link back to the supposed article. Of course, there was no link to include because these screenshots refer to an article that simply doesn\u2019t exist. As of this writing, searching for \u201cBiden\u201d and \u201cdog\u201d on Snopes.com yields the following results:\n\nAfter the above-displayed images went viral, the page posted a second graphic claiming that Biden had buried 937 dogs during the Democratic primary, compared to 0 dogs buried by Sen. Bernie Sanders:\n\nPurveyors of misinformation often present their ruses as if they originated with a credible news outlet. For instance, a hoax website may use a URL that closely resembles that of a genuine news outlet, as was the case with a fake presidential poll in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
