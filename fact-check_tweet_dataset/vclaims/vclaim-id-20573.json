This was true of candidate Trump, who received Three Pinocchios for a series of misleading claims about NATO funding, and of President Trump, who received an updated rating of Four Pinocchios for his failure to correct his talking points.\n\nTrump started making this claim when he ad-libbed it in his maiden speech to Congress at the end of February \u2014 a month into his presidency. \u201cI can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice,\u201d he said, mentioning he was pressing NATO allies in \u201cvery frank and strong discussions.\u201d As we noted at the time, this is nonsensical.\n\nNATO was established in the aftermath of World War II. It began with 12 members in a defense alliance among Western European countries, the United States and Canada to counter the Soviet Union and its satellite countries in Eastern Europe (known as the Warsaw Pact). After the Soviet Union collapsed and the Warsaw Pact unraveled, NATO expanded to include many Eastern European nations and even former parts of the Soviet Union. There are now 29 member countries in NATO.\n\nThere are two types of funding for NATO: direct and indirect. Direct contributions are shared among the 29 member states to pay for the costs of the actual alliance (for example, maintenance and headquarters activity). But when Trump talks about \u201cfinancial obligation\u201d and money pouring into NATO, he is talking about indirect spending. (The White House did not respond to our request for explanation.)\n\nEach NATO member has had this 2 percent spending guideline since 2006, but not everyone had been actively working toward that. Then during a 2014 summit in Wales, NATO members pledged to stop cutting their defense expenditure and \u201cmove toward\u201d that 2 percent guideline within 10 years. This decision, taken just months after the annexation of Crimea, was a response to Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nDefense spending from non-U.S. members is estimated to increase $13 billion in 2017. But there is no evidence the Trump administration had anything to do with these countries\u2019 independent decisions to bolster their own defense spending. These budget decisions were made during the 2016 calendar year, before Trump became president.\n\nIn 2017, six countries met the 2 percent goal. United States leads the pack at 3.6 percent. The other countries are Greece, Estonia, Britain, Romania and Poland. (Greece met the guideline even though it slashed defense spending, because its economy collapsed. This is why some experts say the guideline is rather arbitrary.)\n\n\u201cWho deserves the most credit? Vladimir Putin. It was the invasion of Crimea, the launching of insurgency backed by Russia in Eastern Ukraine, that was the wake-up call for the majority of the allies,\u201d said Alexander Vershbow, former deputy secretary general of NATO. \u201cIt took a while to see the results; 2015 was not a year of substantial increases but 2016 was. So again, Vladimir Putin and his aggressive behavior deserves more credit than the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nEvery U.S. president in recent memory similarly called on other countries to increase their defense spending, experts say, but Trump\u2019s rhetoric may have lit a fire for countries setting their budgets for 2018 and beyond. For example, at the May 25 NATO meeting, member countries agreed to develop a plan by the end of 2017 showing how they would meet the 2 percent guideline.\n\n\u201cEven if you wanted to take a look at the impact that Trump had on defense spending, you have to wait a few years,\u201d said Jim Townsend, former deputy assistant secretary of Defense for European and NATO policy. \u201cIf you see a huge surge in 2018, you can ask: Was that a Trump surge or something else causing that? But you have to get there first. The money that is in the budget this year was set in motion last year.\u201d\n\nTrump certainly is not the first president to insist other members of NATO increase their defense spending. Yet he says that because of his insistence, countries are spending \u201cbillions and billions\u201d more. Defense spending by NATO countries increased since they agreed in 2014 to work toward the 2 percent guideline, in response to threats from Russia. Increases in spending since then were the countries\u2019 voluntary, independent decisions preceding his presidency.", "lang": "en"}
