Gym management repeatedly warned Gonzales against sneaking in and eventually had to call the police.\n\n\u201cI just want to play basketball,\u201d Gonzalez, a highly-ranked high school basketball player who hoped to go pro, said at the time, according to NBC 5 Chicago. \u201cI\u2019ve been sneaking in there a lot, for a long time.\u201d\n\nValenti responded to the call from the fitness facility and, instead of arresting Gonzales for criminal trespassing, offered to pay for his gym membership. Then, XSport Fitness waived the remainder of a two-year membership fee for the teenager, according to the Tribune.\n\n\u201cAfter 23 years in this job, you size up people pretty quickly. And I could tell he was a gentle type of kid,\u201d Valenti told ABC 7, the local affiliate station.\n\n\u201cI thought it was really nice. I texted him and I said \u2018thank you.\u2019 That meant a lot,\u201d said Gonzales in the same interview.", "lang": "en"}
