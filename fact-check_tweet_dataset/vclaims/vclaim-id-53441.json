Further, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) does not pertain to customers at a grocery store.\n\nBusinesses that require customers to wear masks during the COVID-19 pandemic are required to accomodate people who may not be able to wear masks due to a medical condition.\n\nIn April 2020, as major stores such as Costco started requiring customers to wear masks in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, a message started to circulate on social media that appeared to encourage Americans to lie about having medical conditions in order to exploit a \u201cmask loophole.\u201d\n\nStore clerk at the door:\n\n \u201cExcuse me, but do you have a mask?\n\n I can\u2019t let you in without one\u201d. \ud83d\ude2c Me: \u201cNo I\u2019m sorry, I have a medical condition that prohibits the use of anything that could restrict the flow of oxygen to my lungs or brain\u201d. \ud83d\ude36 Their answer 90% of the time:\n\n \u201cOh, okay, sounds good to me, \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n Go ahead, have a great day\u201d Their answer 10% of the time:\n\n \u201cWhat kind of medical condition is THAT\u201d? Gentle Answer: \u201cAccording to HIPAA regulations, you\u2019re not allowed to ask me that. Please don\u2019t discriminate against those who can not wear masks, we need our essentials too.\n\n I\u2019ll be in and out\u201d As long as you\u2019re polite and non aggressive, this has not failed me yet. # staaayfreeeee \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n\nThese \u201cmask loophole\u201d posts sometimes opened with the declaration \u201cDon\u2019t want to wear a mask? Try this!\u201d and ended with \u201cWhat have you got to lose?\u201d They were frequently accompanied by one of two images supposedly showing flyers issued from the U.S. Department of Justice that could be presented to stores to explain that these people were \u201cexempt\u201d from these rules:\n\nHowever, these flyers were not issued, endorsed, or distributed by the Department of Justice, and the advice relayed in the \u201cmask loophole\u201d flyer is both legally and morally questionable.\n\nThe social media post above essentially argues that able-bodied people can lie about having a medical condition in order to avoid wearing a mask in a store that requires customers to wear them. If the store presses them on the issue, they can claim that the store would be violating the federal American Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) by asking them about their medical conditions.\n\nThis social media post doesn\u2019t relay a \u201cmask loophole\u201d so much as it encourages people to exploit a law designed to provide protections to disabled people.\n\nWe reached out to several regional ADA centers for more information about the flyers. While their answers varied in length and content, they all hit on one major theme: Americans without disabilities are not protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act:\n\nNew England ADA Center: The ADA protects the privacy of people who have disabilities. People who lie about a medical condition and don\u2019t have one, do not have rights under the ADA. We are not in favor of people lying in order to get the modifications of policies and procedures that are the legitimate right of people with disabilities for whom wearing a face mask would be detrimental to their medical conditions. Great Lakes ADA Center: \u201cIndividuals without disabilities do not have protected rights in terms of the conditions set forth by a business, etc. in order to come into their establishment but a person with a disability does have rights (ADA plus many state civil rights laws) and thus, business entities must understand these issues and look at what they can do, how they can do it and creative ways of addressing any concerns that they have.\u201d Northeast ADA Center: The ADA protects individuals with disabilities. As with many things in our society, there are people that attempt to take advantage of our system. There are typically remedies for this in criminal and civil law.\n\nA spokesperson for the Justice Department told us the department did not issue the flyers. All of the ADA centers we contacted also told us that they were unfamiliar with the flyers.\n\nThe scenario depicted in this social media post (a citizen refusing to wear a mask at a grocery store) is also unrelated to HIPAA. (It\u2019s worth noting that one of these viral flyers misspelled this acronym \u201cHIPPA\u201d). The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was passed in 1996 with the aim of protecting private medical records. HIPAA restricts hospitals and health care providers from sharing protected information and gives patients better access to their own records. This law has little to do with customers at a grocery store.\n\nKathy Gips, the director of training at the New England ADA Center, told us:\n\nHIPAA does not apply to individuals (in this case, store clerks) asking a customer to wear a mask. It applies to the release of medical records from health personnel.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reiterates this point on its website, explaining that HIPAA regulations apply only to \u201ccovered entities,\u201d including health plans, health care providers, and health care clearinghouses. HHS writes:\n\nThe HHS website also notes that HIPAA does not apply to other entities, such as law enforcement, employers, and schools.\n\nWhile this social media post appeared to be widely circulated by able-bodied people seeking to exploit a \u201cmask loophole,\u201d the ADA does truly protect individuals who cannot wear a mask due to medical conditions from being discriminated against. This means that stores that implement mask requirements have to find ways to accommodate individuals who cannot wear a mask.\n\nSo what about Costco?\n\nThese flyers were widely circulated in the wake of Costco\u2019s announcement that it would be temporarily requiring customers to wear masks while shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic. While these social media posts claimed that showing one of these flyers to a Costco employee would force them store to adhere to the ADA\u2019s anti-discrimination guidelines, Costco was already operating with this in mind. In fact, when Costco announced the mask requirement it noted that this new policy did \u201cnot apply to children under the age of 2 or to individuals who are unable to wear a face covering due to a medical condition.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
