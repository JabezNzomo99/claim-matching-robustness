Moreover, the United States strikes military targets in Syria (against territory held by the Islamic State group, also known as ISIL and ISIS) almost daily. Russia entered the civil war, effectively on the side of the Assad government, in 2015.\n\nThe Obama plan \u201cwas closer to Operation Desert Fox in 1998,\u201d said Derek Chollet, who at the time was assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and who briefed members of Congress about the Obama plan. (Desert Fox was a four-day campaign launched by President Bill Clinton against Iraqi targets said to house or deliver weapons of mass destruction.) \u201cIt was not a pinprick. It would have unfolded over three to four days and was designed to substantially degrade the ability to deliver chemical weapons and also to serve as a deterrence.\u201d\n\nIn briefing Congress, Chollet said lawmakers were not given the entire plan, but \u201cit was clear that this was more than a one-off attack.\u201d He added that lawmakers asked many legitimate questions, especially because planners estimated that two-thirds of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons would not be destroyed. So questions were raised about whether the plan would lead to blowback: more chemical-weapons use by Syria, thus requiring another cycle of U.S. attacks. \u201cThey did not want to share accountability for what was going to happen in Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nYet, three years later, Kerry\u2019s flub appears to have defined the Obama plan, so much so that lawmakers now wrongly believe that Trump\u2019s one-night jab with cruise missiles is more robust than what Obama had in mind. As McConnell put it, Trump\u2019s attack was \u201cplanned, well-executed, went right to the heart of the matter, which is using chemical weapons. So, had I seen that \u2014 that kind of approach by President Obama, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve signed up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s delayed response was to call for a show of force, for targeted, limited strikes against the regime. We have been told that the purpose of these strikes is to deter and degrade the Assad regime\u2019s ability to use chemical weapons,\u201d he said, appearing to know then that it was more than a one-night attack. But he said it was obvious \u2014 even to Obama \u2014 that Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons was not a threat to the vital interests of the United States.\n\nMcConnell added: \u201cIndeed, if through this limited strike the president\u2019s credibility is not restored, because Assad uses chemical weapons again, what then? Add new targets aimed at toppling the regime which end up jeopardizing control of these same chemical weapons stashes \u2014 allowing them to fall into the hands of al-Qaeda or others intent on using them against the United States or our allies. Where would the cycle of escalation end?\u201d (You can read the full speech here.)\n\nStrong, informed of the actual Obama plan, replied: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to comment on what President Obama\u2019s classified war plans allegedly included. The fact remains that the chief advocate for President Obama\u2019s proposed strikes considered them unbelievably small and broadcast that to the world. In and of itself, that undermined the deterrent effect of whatever the rest of their plan may or may not have been.\u201d\n\nSyria in 2013 was a country with large stocks of chemical weapons, so even a three-day attack would have left much of its arsenal in place. Syria in 2017 has vastly fewer chemical weapons, but the civil war has tilted toward the Assad regime, especially after increased involvement of Russia and Iran. Syria also engaged in a chemical weapons attack after having pledged that its weapons had been removed. Trump thus faced a different set of calculations than Obama in contemplating a response.\n\nBut these changed circumstances do not excuse the fact that McConnell and Ryan opposed a multiday attack to degrade Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile \u2014 with McConnell even questioning whether U.S. interests were at stake \u2014 while quickly applauding Trump\u2019s attack as robust action demonstrating U.S. leadership. In a bit of revisionist history, officials are now suggesting that they opposed Obama\u2019s plan because it was weaker than Trump\u2019s attack, relying on the Kerry quote to make their case. But the reality is that Trump\u2019s action was more limited than what Obama had contemplated at the time. At the very least, that should be acknowledged before applauding the new commander in chief.", "lang": "en"}
