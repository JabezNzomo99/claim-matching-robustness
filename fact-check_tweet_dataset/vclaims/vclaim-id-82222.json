Is he correct?\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute (EPI) found slow and unequal wage growth in recent decades, and a \u201cnear stagnation\u201d of hourly wage growth over the past generation for the majority of American workers. Hourly wage data compiled by the group, from the Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey, show a breakdown by percentile from 1973 to 2013, adjusted to 2013 dollars. Hourly wages for the 10th through 60th percentiles in 2013 were lower, or relatively flat compared to their hourly wages in 2001.\n\nThe trend begins to change in the 70th percentile, whose 2013 hourly wages ($23.88) were slightly higher than in 2001 ($23.57). The increase in hourly wage becomes progressively bigger in the 80th, 90th and 95th percentiles. It is unclear exactly at which point between the 60th and 70th percentiles that the trend changes.\n\nEPI President Lawrence Mishel said the group does not track the information back to World War II. But given that wages grew after the war and through the 1960s, Mishel said he is confident there was not the same wage stagnation in the 1950s or 1960s.\n\nHowever, the EPI data end in 2013. FactCheck.org reported that EPI\u2019s year-to-year comparisons \u201cfail to reflect a remarkable and broad spike in real wages and earnings\u201d in more recent, month-to-month data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to April 2015 BLS data of weekly paychecks for nonsupervisory employees, real earnings were 6.6 percent higher than they were in April 2003, Factcheck.org reported.\n\nThe 1947-2013 Current Population Survey data from O\u2019Malley\u2019s staff show a breakdown of family income (not earnings) for each fifth percentile, adjusted to 2013 dollars. The table shows that family income at the 80th percentile is lower in 2013 than in 2001, and was the case for 12-year periods going back to 1999. It is important to note that according to experts, Census data prior to 1960s are not as reliable as more recent data.\n\nThe percentile data do not reflect individual Americans\u2019 wages, and instead shows the distribution of wages. The Current Population Survey does not follow the same people over time. So the people who were in the 70th percentile in 2001 may not be in the same percentile in 2013, even though his statement could mean that 70 percent of the same Americans earn less or the same 12 years later.\n\nThe Panel Study of Income Dynamics does measure that information. The ongoing study began in 1968, of nationally representative sample of individual Americans. But such longitudinal study would not support O\u2019Malley\u2019s claim, according to Urban Institute\u2019s Stephen Rose. Tracking individual wages this way would show growth in majority of 12-year periods, if only for the life cycle effect: people tend to earn more money up to about 50 years old, then even out until retirement.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s general point has some merit \u2014 when looking at the period his staff cited \u2014 that a large portion of Americans saw wage stagnation from 2001 to 2013. But his statement is based in outdated data that do not reflect the most recent spike real hourly wages after 2013. Further, neither dataset provided by his staff supports the specifics in his claim, especially that this is the \u201cfirst time that that has happened this side of World War II.\u201d (PolitiFact rated this comment \u201cHalf True.\u201d)\n\nThe EPI table dates to 1973, and the most recent 12-year period (2001 to 2013) was the third time wages fell between 1973 and 2013 for up to the 70th percentile. Census data from the campaign show the same trend started in the 12-year period beginning in 1999, for family incomes at the 80th percentile.\n\nWe wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. But the details matter \u2014 especially when making such a specific statement in a speech as significant as the announcement of his run for president. So O\u2019Malley earns Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
