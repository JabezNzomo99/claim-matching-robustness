Cow slaughter is illegal in the state. Meanwhile five people have been arrested for carrying out the attack.\n\nTh shocking incident came to light after two videos of the incident went viral on social media on May 24, 2019.\n\nOne of the videos show the attackers pinning the male victim against a pole and assaulting him with a wooden stick. The other video shows a man, under duress from the attackers, hit the woman with a slipper while they force them to say 'Jai Shri Ram'.\n\nBOOM was tagged by a few of our readers on Twitter to verify the video. We reached out to Superintendent of Police, Madhya Pradesh who directed us to speak to officials at the Dunda police station.\n\nBOOM contacted the Dunda police station where another police official told us more about the incident on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"The incident is from May 22, (2019),\" the police official said.\n\n\"A group of three people, two men and a woman, were allegedly carrying beef. A group of self-proclaimed cow-vigilantes were tipped off and they intercepted the trio and attacked them with laathis.\"\n\nHe also told BOOM that after attacking the trio, the cow-vigilantes fled the spot warning the victims of dire consequences if they informed the police.\n\n\"However, we got news about the incident and we made the arrests. First, the trio was arrested on charges of carrying beef. Then we tracked the attackers and arrested all of them too,\" the cop said.\n\nThe meat seized has been sent to a forensic lab in Hyderabad to determine if it is beef, the police official said.\n\nWhen asked whether the attackers had any political affiliations, the police official did not give a clear answer.\n\nHowever, when we named a particular cow-vigilante group whose name has cropped up in connection with the attack, he said that one of the attackers was the member of the group.\n\nBOOM checked the Facebook profile of one of the attackers who according to a Twitter user - had posted the video on his timeline only to delete it later.\n\nWe found that Shubham Singh was the same person leading the attack in the video.\n\nShubham Singh has also uploaded a photo with terror accused Pragya Thakur, who was recently elected as an MP from Bhopal, on his Facebook page.\n\nSeveral other pictures on his Facebook profile show his connection with Shri Ram Sena.\n\nBOOM is not sharing any of the videos due to their graphic content.", "lang": "en"}
