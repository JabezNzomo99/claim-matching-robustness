The claim is false; the hospital autopsy, a top government public health official and local police said the infant died after choking on a peanut; AFP spoke to the girl's father who said it shows his late daughter.\n\nThe photo was published in a Facebook post on August 26, 2019. It was shared more than 180 times before it was removed. The post showed a photo of an infant girl alongside a caption claiming that she died after being given the polio vaccine in the northwestern Pakistani town of Swabi.\n\nThe Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSwabi: Sad news.
