As a result of the episode, $32.6 million in government investment was not recouped.\n\nIn the aftermath of a series of hurricanes in September 2017 \u2014 particularly Maria, which devastated the United States territory of Puerto Rico \u2014 President Donald Trump reflected on the infrastructural damage caused by those storms in a 25 September 2017 tweet:\n\nIn response, public relations and marketing executive Lainie Green issued a series of tweets that went viral, accusing President Trump of having added to Puerto Rico\u2019s debt by bankrupting a golf course there and defaulting on $33 million worth of government-issued bonds:\n\nGreen\u2019s account of the episode got some facts right, but it also left out some important context necessary for any assessment of Trump\u2019s responsibility for the bankruptcy of the golf course.\n\nAccording to documents first detailed in a 2016 BuzzFeed investigation, in 2008 Trump International entered into an arrangement with the owners of Coco Beach Golf & Country Club, a foundering resort and golf course that had opened in 2004 on the northeast coast of Puerto Rico about 30 miles from San Juan. Under the agreement, the future president\u2019s company licensed the Trump name to the owners and took on a share of the resort\u2019s day-to-day management in exchange for a fee.\n\nThe owners of the resort, which was renamed Trump International Golf Club Puerto Rico after 2008, had already received significant financial assistance from the Puerto Rican government before Trump\u2019s intervention. In 2000 and 2004, Puerto Rico\u2019s Industrial, Tourist, Educational, Medical and Environmental Control Facilities Financing Authority (AFICA) issued the owners of the club a total of $25,497,854 in bonds to help build and launch the resort. In 2009, the Puerto Rican government also invested $50 million in the Hotel Gran Melia, which was part of the resort and provided a crucial stream of customers for the golf club, according to BuzzFeed.\n\nBy October 2011, Coco Beach had defaulted on $26 million in bonds and had to seek another round of financing. In 2015, the company filed for bankruptcy under its original name, Coco Beach Golf and Country Club, citing debts of more than $78 million but only $9 million in assets. Bankruptcy court records show that Puerto Rico\u2019s Tourism Development Fund made a claim of $32,606,821, essentially leaving Puerto Rican taxpayers on the hook for the better part of $33 million.\n\nDoes all this mean that Trump \u201cbankrupted\u201d the golf course, though? Not exactly.\n\nThe evidence shows that Coca Beach had consistently been operating at a loss and accumulating debts in the years before Trump International became involved with its management. And a significant portion of the financial assistance provided by the Puerto Rican government was given in 2000 and 2004, well before the future U.S. president\u2019s company arrived on the scene.\n\nPuerto Rico had already been hard hit by a recession well before the Trump International contracted to assist with the club\u2019s management, and in the two years before Trump International\u2019s intervention (2006-07), Coco Beach operated at an average annual net loss of $5.3 million, according to BuzzFeed. Moreover, neither Donald Trump nor Trump International held an ownership stake in the property, took part in its development, or was involved with its financing; they only operated and managed the resort. Holding Trump to be solely or primarily responsible for the bankruptcy of a business they didn\u2019t own, that was already heavily in debt, and was losing several million dollars a year before Trump arrived on the scene would be something of an unfair standard.\n\nHowever, one could argue that Trump International received a good deal of money from the Coco Beach deal yet failed to turn the club around, or even stanch its financial bleeding. According to the March 2011 bond offering (which was itself required to cover losses on the Puerto Rican government\u2019s 2000 and 2004 bond investments), Trump International had given certain assurances about the future viability of the resort:\n\nWhatever that plan was, it did not succeed. The 2012 financials show that the club\u2019s average annual losses rose to $6.3 million during the period that Trump\u2019s company provided management services to the resort (2008-2012), $1 million more per year than the business had been losing before. Further, for this lack of success, Trump International garnered a total of $609,607 in management fees between 2008 and 2012. (This figure is likely the source of Lainie Green\u2019s reference to a \u201c$600,000 paycheck\u201d received by Donald Trump.)\n\nDonald Trump did not set Coco Beach Golf and Country Club on course for ruin, but he wasn\u2019t able to save it from that fate. His role in the bankruptcy of the company, which ended up costing Puerto Rican taxpayers $32.6 million, was significant but limited. That $32.6 million loss constituted 0.03 percent of the territory\u2019s total $123 billion debt, which prompted the Puerto Rican government to file for bankruptcy relief in May 2017.", "lang": "en"}
