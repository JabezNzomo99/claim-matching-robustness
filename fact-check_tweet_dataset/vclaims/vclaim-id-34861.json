Cellphones are a necessity of life today. But there were no cellphones in 1960, so people who like the OPM would say that people without a cellphone have more to eat than people in 1960 did, so poverty has gone down. And today\u2019s low income families definitely have more to eat than most families in the 19th century. ... The SPM tries, instead, to adjust the poverty line for the changing definition of what \u2018being poor\u2019 means.\u201d\n\nHartley, who collaborated on the report from the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, said \u201ca 200-percent of SPM threshold definition of low-income families is constructive for considering how many families, individuals or children may be at risk of poverty or material hardship, especially when many lower-income families face volatile incomes across the year and are vulnerable in the event of an economic or health emergency.\u201d We note that Hartley is writing in terms of \u201clow-income families\u201d who are \u201cat risk of poverty,\u201d not just the poor.\n\n\u201cA four-person household with an income of $30,000 a year is not poor by this measure,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThe population living between 100-199% of the poverty threshold is designated as \u2018low-income,\u2019 but they are, in reality, just one emergency, health care crisis, traffic violation to themselves or a loved one away from being poor, and most likely will fall under that line over the course of the year. This is why we look at everyone living under 200% of the poverty threshold for the SPM \u2014 everyone who is poor and low-income.\u201d (We would add a caveat here: Private or public health benefits, which are not factored into the SPM, would soften the financial blow in a health-care crisis.)\n\nIs someone poor because they can\u2019t afford basic necessities? Or because they can\u2019t afford the same lifestyle as the average American, even though they provide for their household? Using a relative measurement, someone could be counted as poor, start making more money, and still be counted as poor because those at the top pushed up the average. The CRS report noted, \u201cThe SPM includes aspects of both relative and absolute measures in its computation, and gauging whether the SPM is closer to one or the other is an unresolved question.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
