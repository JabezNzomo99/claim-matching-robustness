Bynum-Coleman told us on July 26 that they were posted by a campaign worker and she didn\u2019t know their sources. She said she\u2019d call us back with more information, but we didn\u2019t hear from her. We reached her again on Aug. 2 and she said she\u2019d call us back. That call hasn\u2019t come as of this writing.\n\nSo, we took off on our own.\n\nBynum-Coleman may have been referring to data in a 2014 National Research Council report on \"Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences.\" Pages 60 and 61 focus on drug crimes. The study has not been updated.\n\nThe report says, \"The prevalence of drug use is only slightly higher among blacks than whites for some illicit drugs and slightly lower for others; the difference is not substantial. There is also little evidence, when all drug types are considered, that blacks sell drugs more often than whites.\"\n\nThat agrees with data from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. It found 11.8 percent of whites and 13.7 percent of blacks 18 or older said they had used illicit drugs during the past month.\n\nThe National Research Council report says, \"In recent years, drug-related arrest rates for blacks have been three to four times higher than those for whites. In the late 1980s, the rates were six times higher for blacks than for whites.\"\n\nBynum-Coleman also cited statistics about the racial rates of imprisonment for drug crimes. Those numbers are harder to find.\n\nOn similar fact checks, PolitiFact has turned to Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst for The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group in Washington. She\u2019s pointed to racial breakdowns by the Bureau of Justice Statistics on the number of people in prisons for drug offenses.\n\nThose numbers aren't perfect for our comparison. For example, the state prison data only lists inmates based on their most serious offense, so someone also convicted of a drug crime may not be listed in that category if that person was given a longer sentence for assault.\n\nWe compared the bureau\u2019s newest data to estimated racial populations by the U.S. Census Bureau and found the black imprisonment rate for drug offenses near the end of 2016 was 6.45 times higher than the rate of whites.\n\nThat\u2019s close to an assertion on the NAACP's Criminal Justice Fact Sheet that \"the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost six times that of whites.\" The statistic is undated and unsourced.\n\nIn Virginia, blacks were imprisoned for drug offenses at about 6.1 times the rate of whites at the start of 2019. That\u2019s according to a racial breakdown of prisoners whose most serious crime was drug-related, sent to us by the state Department of Corrections, compared to census population estimates.\n\nBynum-Coleman says, \"African Americans are three to four times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes, and nine times more likely to be imprisoned.\" She hasn\u2019t provided sources for the statement.\n\nShe\u2019s on the mark in saying blacks are three to four times more likely to be arrested for drug offenses.That matches findings in a 2014 study by the National Research Council that hasn\u2019t been updated.\n\nClearly, there\u2019s a huge imbalance in black and white imprisonment rates for drug offenses, but not as big the nine times greater for blacks claimed by Bynum-Coleman. Our research shows it was 6.45 times greater in 2016 - the latest year necessary statistics are available. In Virginia, it was 6.1 times higher for blacks at the start of 2019.\n\nOverall, we rate her claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
