The surroundings are so clean and there is no garbage\u201d.\n\nThe top photo shows a yellow bridge with a man on a bike, while the photo below it shows a building with a logo above the entrance.\n\nUsing reverse search, AFP traced the top photo to this 2014 blog about bikeways in Marikina city. Marikina city is part of Metro Manila, about 1,500 kilometres (950 miles) from Davao. Here is the city\u2019s official website.\n\nA reverse search of the second photo also traces it back to the about page of the official website of Marikina city. The photo in the website contains the address and contact details of the Marikina city hall.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Marikina page that shows the same image as in the misleading post.\n\nThe misleading post was shared more than 1,500 times in less than four days by a Facebook group that promotes senatorial candidate Ronald \u201cBato\u201d dela Rosa, an ally of Duterte. \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
