During demonstrations in the U.S., multiple statues have been defaced or torn down by protesters, according to The Atlantic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to know \u2018Why mobs are tearing down America\u2019s monuments,'\u201d reads the caption of the image. \u201cI would rather know \u2018Why are we letting them?'\u201d (RELATED: Viral Post Claims A COVID-19 Mobile Testing Truck Bears The Symbol Of The Egyptian God Anubis)\n\nHowever, the image does not depict a statue being thrown into water in the U.S. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that it comes from a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol, England. Photographer Ben Birchall took the photo, available on the website AP Images, for the Press Association on June 7, according to the caption.\n\n\u201cBlack Lives Matter protests,\u201d reads the AP Images caption. \u201cProtesters throw statue of Edward Colston into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest rally, in memory of George Floyd who was killed on May 25 while in police custody in the US city of Minneapolis. Picture date: Sunday June 7, 2020.\u201d\n\nBBC News published a video of the statue being toppled the following day, and Reuters has footage of it later being removed from Bristol Harbor. The statue in the photo depicts Edward Colston, who was a \u201c17th-century trader who made a fortune transporting enslaved Africans across the Atlantic to the Americas on Bristol-based ships,\u201d according to The Associated Press.\n\nThere was a statue of Black Lives Matter activist Jen Reid briefly installed without city approval on the plinth that held the Colston statue, The Guardian reported. The statue, created by artist Marc Quinn, was later removed.\n\nBristol City Council said the sculpture would be \u201cheld at our museum for the artist to collect or donate to our collection,\u201d according to The Associated Press.", "lang": "en"}
