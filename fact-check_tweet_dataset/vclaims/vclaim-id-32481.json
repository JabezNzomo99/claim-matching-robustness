Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that image.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of Trump honouring the dog that was involved in the operation of killing ISIS chief Al-Bagdadi. Fact: The image is a photoshopped one. The original image is that of President Donald Trump awarding \u2018Medal of Honor\u2019 to James McCloughan of the US Army. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn October 28, 2019, Donald Trump tweeted the image of the dog that was involved in the operation of killing ISIS chief Al-Bagdadi in Syria.\n\n\n\nLater, on 30 October 30 2019, Trump made another tweet with the image of him honouring the dog with a medal and texted \u2018American Hero\u2019. \n\n\n\nBut, when that image was subjected to reverse image technique, the search result of \u2018CNN\u2019 with a similar image but showing Trump honouring a person was obtained. From the article, it was found that the image is related to Trump awarding \u2018Medal of Honor\u2019 to James McCloughan of the US Army. When the two images were observed carefully, it can be understood that the image of Trump honouring the dog is a photoshopped image of Trump awarding \u2018Medal of Honor\u2019 to James McCloughan.\n\n\n\nLater on, in another tweet, Trump also called the image of him honouring the dog as a \u2018recreation\u2019 of the original image. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, the image of Trump honouring the dog that involved in the operation of killing ISIS chief Al-Bagdadi is a photoshopped one.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
