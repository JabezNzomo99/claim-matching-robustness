The post claims that the ban is also applicable to teaching faculty. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nWhen searched for the news on Google with the keywords \u2018UP ban mobiles in colleges\u2019, it was found that even reputed news agencies like India Today (Archived), News18 (Archived), Outlook (Archived), Business Today (Archived), NDTV (Archived), Business Insider (Archived), Times Now News (Archived), Financial Express (Archived), The Week (Archived), Zee News (Archived), Asianet (Archived), Loksatta (Archived), Republic TV (Archived) and DNA India (Archived) have also published the same news.\n\nIn all the news articles, it was written that the Directorate of Higher Education (Uttar Pradesh) had issued a circular to ban mobile phones in colleges and universities. So, when searched for that circular on the Directorate of Higher Education (Uttar Pradesh) website, no such circular was found. But, in the News section on the website, it was found that the Directorate of Higher Education (Uttar Pradesh) has issued a clarification on this issue. The clarification (by Vandana Sharma \u2013 Director, Higher Education, U.P.) has refuted the claims made by some of the media channels and denied releasing any circular banning mobile phones in colleges and universities. Also, in a Hindustan Times article, it can be read that the UP Deputy CM has said that \u2018the Yogi Adityanath government has not issued any order to ban the use of mobile phones by students in the state\u2019s university and degree colleges\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, the UP government has not issued any circular to ban mobile phones in colleges and universities.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
