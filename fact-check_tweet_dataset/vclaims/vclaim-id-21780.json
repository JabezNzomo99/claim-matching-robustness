We repeatedly contacted the group but didn't hear back.\n\nFirst, it's important to realize that if you're only going back a generation (20 years), you're only comparing Obama to two other presidents \u2014 Bill Clinton who took office in 1993 and George W. Bush, who was inaugurated in 2001.\n\nWe turned to Mark Knoller, White House correspondent at CBS News, the zen master of data on all things presidential such as vacations, trips, news conferences and even teleprompter use.\n\nHe told us via email that Obama has been on 28 vacations (including long weekends) spanning all or part of 217 days. The president has just over four months left in his term.\n\nHis predecessor, Bush, made 77 visits to his Texas ranch spanning all or part of 490 days. There were also 11 visits to his parent's home in Kennebunkport, Maine, spanning all or part of 43 days. Total: 533.\n\nBut by Knoller's count, Clinton took the fewest \u2014 174 days of summer vacations on Martha\u2019s Vineyard and at Jackson Hole, Wyo.\n\nSo the first part of the Occupy Democrats post is wrong.\n\nWe didn't have to go very far back in time to discover that this part of the Occupy Democrats meme is wrong as well.\n\nDefining vacation days for Congress is harder than for a president. After all, when members don't have to be in Washington for a vote, they may be in their districts, meeting with voters, or attending to official duties. And let's be real here \u2014 they might also be treating it like a vacation.\n\nAs of Sept. 6, 2016, the House had been in session 94 days. The Senate had been in session 114 days. We decided to start by looking at House calendars.\n\nThis year, the House is scheduled to be in session for another 32 days. That means House members will have been officially working in Washington for a total of about 126 days.\n\nThat\u2019s more days on the calendar than in 2008, when House members met for 119 calendar days, and in 2006, when they met for 104 days.\n\nThe House looks even less lazy if you look at 2015, the first year of the current Congress. That year, the House met for 157 calendar days, more than in 2014 (137 days), 2012 (153 days), 2010 (128 days), 2008 (119 days) and 2006 (104 days).\n\nAlternatively, we looked at the data in two-year blocks, which would be full sessions of Congress. The current House (the 114th session, 2015-16) has met or is scheduled to meet for 283 days. But in the 109th session (2005-06) it met for 247 days, which is 36 days fewer.\n\nIn fact, the current session is slated to have more days than the 105th, 106th, 107th and 108th Congresses as well.\n\nWe found the same pattern in the Senate, which has met, or is scheduled to meet, for 156 days this year. It didn't matter whether we looked at projected days this year or actual days last year. Since 2000, there were at least six years the Senate met fewer times.\n\nAnd when we combined House and Senate tallies, the current 114th Congress is on track to have officially worked in Washington more days than the 113th, 109th, 108th, 107th and 106th Congresses.\n\nOccupy Democrats says Obama \"has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation,\" while Congress \"has taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history.\"\n\nThe post is wrong for Obama. It is ridiculously wrong for Congress.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
