Are they really\u2026 I mean really?\"\n\nAfter someone else suggested that the coronavirus has been in the United States for longer than has been reported, the commenter said: \"Wow.

The findings were disputed by the city\u2019s chief medical examiner, who stood by her office\u2019s report.\n\nOn Jan. 5, 2020, \"60 Minutes\" reported on photographs from inside Epstein\u2019s cell that \"possibly raise more questions\" about his death.\n\nBut we found nothing credible tying Epstein\u2019s death to the coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
