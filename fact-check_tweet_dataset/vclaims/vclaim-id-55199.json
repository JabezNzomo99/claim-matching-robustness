There is no record of Melinda Gates releasing the statement attributed to her in the post.\n\nBill and Melinda Gates chair the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest private charitable organization in the world, according to Forbes. The Gates Foundation has helped fund health care initiatives in Africa, including efforts to provide vaccines for Ebola and other diseases, per the foundation\u2019s website.\n\nA post being shared claims Melinda Gates released a statement announcing her divorce from Bill Gates, citing the latter\u2019s supposed efforts to \u201cdestroy Africa\u201d with vaccines. It appears to reference vaccine candidates for the new coronavirus, as well as a \u201cfake Ebola vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appeal to the prudence and to the African conscience, everything is planned to destroy Africa and it is the African leaders who are the first accomplices,\u201d her alleged statement reads. \u201cI decided to do this statement because my conscience brings me closer to all the harm we have done to Africans by the fake Ebola vaccine that has killed 1 million innocent children, that is why I no longer want to live with a bloodthirsty person whatever his money.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of Melinda Gates divorcing her husband, nor of her releasing the statement attributed to her in the post. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any mention of their marriage ending on the websites and social media pages maintained by the couple, and media outlets haven\u2019t reported about the alleged divorce. The statement seems to be fabricated, as it does not appear in such places either.\n\nBill Gates has been the subject of false claims that vaccines linked to him have caused serious harm or death to significant numbers of people in the past. There are no media reports about the Gates Foundation contributing to vaccine efforts for Ebola or any other disease that resulted in mass deaths.\n\nIn addition, the post alleges Bill Gates plans to bribe African leaders with $200 billion \u201cto destroy the Africans,\u201d despite Forbes estimating his net worth to be $113.2 billion at the time of publication.
