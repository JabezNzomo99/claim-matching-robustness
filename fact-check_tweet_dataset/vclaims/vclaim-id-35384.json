Readers are advised not to confuse the \u2018news reports\u2019 of Faking News as being genuine and true.\u201d Thus, the article published on Faking News is a work of satire.\n\nFurther, we found that while the former J&K chief minister had made a comment on Article 370 in 2014, which does not allude to an earthquake. He tweeted, \u201cMark my words and save this tweet \u2013 long after Modi Government is a distant memory either J&K won't be part of India or Article 370 will still exist.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to NDTV, the spokesperson of National Conference (NC) Imran Dar denied the claim made by PM Modi about its leader Omar Abdullah and said, \"Omar Abdullah made no such statement. Every statement of Omar Abdullah is in the public domain and he has not made any such statement.\u201d\n\nViolence will only play in to the hands of those who do not have the best interests of the state in mind. This wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the India J&K acceded to but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not quite ready to give up hope yet. Let calm heads prevail. God be with you all. \u2014 Omar Abdullah (@OmarAbdullah) August 4, 2019\n\nFormer Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, besides two political stalwarts from NC and its arch-rival PDP, were booked under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) by the administration on Thursday, 6 February, officials said in Srinagar. Their six-month preventive custody was due to end on Thursday. Evidently, PM Narendra Modi wrongly attributed a quote from the satirical website Faking News to former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.", "lang": "en"}
