The claim is false; the video has been edited from original footage which clearly shows the politician pointing a microphone at his debate opponent.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than 25,000 times after being shared in this misleading Facebook post on April 24, 2019.\n\nThe caption in the post states: \u201cTMC leader pulls out and points a gun at BJP speaker during a debate in W. Bengal. Mamata talks of democracy being in danger.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\n\u201cTMC leader\u201d refers to Rabindra Nath Ghosh, a minister for the government of West Bengal and a member of the All India Trinamool Congress party (TMC).\n\nGhosh is the man on the left side of the stage in the misleading footage, wearing a white top with a blue waistcoat.\n\n\u201cBJP speaker\u201d refers to Nisith Pramanik, a Bharatiya Janata Party candidate for the city of Cooch Behar in West Bengal. His name appears here on a list of candidates for the BJP in West Bengal.\n\nPramanik is the man on the right hand side of the stage in the misleading footage, wearing orange.\n\n\u201cMamata\u201d refers to Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of the eastern Indian state of West Bengal and founder Chairperson of the All India Trinamool Congress party. This is her official Twitter account.\n\nThe video was also on Facebook with a similar claim here, here and here and on Twitter here and here.\n\nBut the claim is false; the misleading footage has been edited from an original video of the debate which clearly shows Rabindra Nath Ghosh pointing a microphone at his opponent.\n\nAFP located this original video published on a YouTube channel named Zee24Ghanta on April 8, 2019, by conducting keyword searches.\n\nZee24Ghanta is a subsidiary Bengali news channel of Indian television channel Zee News. This is its description on the \u2018about\u2019 section of its YouTube channel. This is its official Facebook page.\n\nThe video in the misleading posts is identical to the Zee24Ghanta YouTube video, starting from 10:04.\n\nThe misleading footage also has the Zee watermark in the right hand upper corner of the screen.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the Zee24Ghanta YouTube video (L) at 10:04 and the beginning of the video in the misleading posts (R):\n\nAt the 11:11 in the original Zee24Ghanta video, the footage shows Rabindra Nath Ghosh just before he points an object at BJP candidate Nisith Pramanik.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of this moment in the original Zee24Ghanta YouTube video, in which Rabindra Nath Ghosh can clearly be seen to be holding a microphone:\n\nAt 11:15 in the original Zee24Ghanta video, Rabindra Nath Ghosh points the microphone at Nisith Pramanik.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of this moment in the Zee24Ghanta YouTube video:\n\nZee News also used parts of the footage in this video report on its YouTube channel.\n\nThe video title states: \u201cTMC MLA attacks BJP leader with mic in between debate.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
