This claim is false. According to a garden historian, the original roses were removed in 1962 and subsequent administrations have changed certain roses. The White House Landscape report shows that none of the original crab apple trees from the Kennedy administration remained when the renovation work began.\n\nThe posts, shared over 93,000 times ( here , here , here ), either consist of text saying \u201cMelania dug up the WH Rose Garden, removing roses from every First Lady since 1913\u201d or they are a screenshot of a Tweet (here) which shows the new and old rose gardens and reads, \u201cThose were Jackie Kennedy\u2019s crabapple tree\u2019s [sic]. Many of those rose bushes were from ALL the First Ladies of America, going all the way back to Ellen Louise Wilson in 1913\u2026\u201d\n\nThe newly designed Rose Garden was revealed on August 22 (here) ahead of Melania Trump\u2019s Republican National Convention speech delivered from the Rose Garden on August 25 (here). Vox explained the changes in more detail here .\n\nFirst Lady Ellen Wilson did redesign the garden in 1913. As explained in page 3 of the White House Landscape Report (here) \u201cThis design was also the first time the garden incorporated roses as the dominant flower in the planting scheme.\u201d\n\nThere is no definitive list of all the roses that have been planted in the Rose Garden. The Landscape Report states on page 80 (here) that, \u201cRecords are scarce for plantings in the years after Bunny Mellon\u2019s design [in 1962] (beyond commemorative tree planting), up until President Jimmy Carter\u2019s time in residence.\u201d However, on pages 81 to 85 there is a list of a selection of roses grown previously at the White House, showing that different roses were brought in during different administrations.\n\nReuters asked Marta McDowell, garden historian and author of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Gardens\u201d (here), if it was possible that the roses from all previous First Ladies since 1913 would still have been in place just before Melania\u2019s redesign. She told Reuters via email that there is \u201cNot a chance\u201d this would be the case. McDowell added that, \u201cIn 1962, the construction of the Kennedy rose garden took the site down to the dirt. Since then, most administrations have changed out some of the roses\u2014hybrid tea and floribunda roses don\u2019t always thrive, especially in D.C. humidity. So that statement is not factually correct.\u201d\n\nIn July, the Washington Post\u2019s gardening columnist Adrian Higgins wrote that one of the problems Melania needed to address in the redesign was \u201cthe die-off of rose bushes to the point where only a dozen or so remained.\u201d (here)\n\nMelania Trump\u2019s design does have roses, including the Hybrid Tea Rose and The White House Rose (here).\n\nRegarding the crab apple trees, page 75 of the Landscape report (here) shows that the ten original Katherine crab apples (Malus \u2018Katherine\u2019), pictured lined up in rows in the viral social media posts, were planted in the 1962 Kennedy redesign of the Rose Garden. However, it states that all these trees had been replaced two or three times by the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations in 2003, 2010, 2016 and 2019. The document states, \u201cThis is all in keeping with the life of gardens, in which a design is retained while plant materials are renewed\u201d.\n\nCNN correspondent, Kate Bennet, said she was told that the ten crab apple trees \u201cwere removed to the off-campus White House gardening centre for care\u201d and that \u201cthey will eventually be replanted on the [White House] grounds.\u201d (here)\n\nFalse. Melania Trump did not remove the roses from all past First Ladies since 1913. All roses from 1913 to 1962 were removed in the Kennedy redesign and subsequent administrations have had to replace roses that have died. The crab apple trees had been replaced since the Kennedy administration and will be replanted on the White House grounds.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
