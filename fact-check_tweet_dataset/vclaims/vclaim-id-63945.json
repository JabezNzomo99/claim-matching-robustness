During a campaign speech, Trump appeared to suggest that if he\u2019s reelected in 2020, he should be granted yet another four years as a \u201credo\u201d of his first term.\n\nTrump, who is up for reelection on Nov. 3, 2020, to a second term, did indeed make the comment during a campaign rally in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, held on Aug. 17.
