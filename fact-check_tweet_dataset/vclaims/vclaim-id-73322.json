The claim is false; the image actually shows Japanese actress Hiroe Igeta in a scene from a Japanese television series.\n\nThe image was published here on August 12, 2020. It was shared in a Hong Kong-based pro-government Facebook group with more than 11,700 members.\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cAgnes Chow has the appearance of an angel, but she has actually been receiving military training in secret. This is very dangerous.\u201d\n\nAgnes Chow is a prominent Hong Kong activist and co-founder of Demosisto, a now-dissolved pro-democracy political party established in 2016. She was arrested for alleged crimes under Beijing's new National Security Law on August 10, 2020 and released on bail the next day. Here is an AFP report about her arrest.\n\nThe image was also shared here, here, here, here and here on Facebook; as well as here on Gamer, a Taiwan-based forum, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found this video titled \u201cKamen Rider Zero-One- Episode 2 PREVIEW\u201d, published on YouTube on August 31, 2019.\n\nThe image in the misleading post can be seen at the video\u2019s nine-second mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nKamen Rider Zero-One is a Japanese television series broadcast on TV Asahi since September 2019.\n\nA summary of the second episode on Kamen Rider Zero-One\u2019s official website, as suggested by the title of the YouTube video above, reveals the actress in the scene is Hiroe Igeta. She is listed as playing the part of Yua Yaiba.\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, Chow denied that she had been pictured holding a gun in this August 13, 2020 Facebook post. She shared a screenshot of one of the misleading posts alongside a caption which reads: \u201cBrains are awesome. I wish everybody had one.\u201d\n\nJoshua Wong, a co-founder of Demosisto alongside Chow, also addressed the misleading posts in this Facebook post published on August 13, 2020.\n\nSharing a screenshot of the misleading post, he wrote in traditional Chinese: \u201cPeople say: \u2018once you join a pro-China party, your brain will suffer damage\u2019. Let me tell you a secret; Agnes Chow can transform!\u201d", "lang": "en"}
