The video which was shared on social media last year is still being shared by many. Let\u2019s try to analyze the extent of truth claimed in this post.\n\n\n\nIn the posted video, at around 0.40 seconds, a person saying about Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam can be heard. With that information when searched on youtube using keywords in English and Tamil, many search results were found. Some of the search results with the same video said that the golden dome shown in the video is from Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. But under one of the videos found in the search results, a person has commented that most of them are mistaking the Ranganathaswamy temple in Newyork as Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. From that information, when searched on Google about that temple in Newyork, a photo of that temple\u2019s golden dome was found. When this photo was compared with the golden dome at 0.17 seconds of the posted video it was found that both are similar. Furthermore, the surroundings seen in the posted video can also be seen in the satellite image of the Ranganathaswamy temple in Newyork.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe temple shown in the posted video is not of Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam because when the photo of the temple in Srirangam was compared with the golden dome of the temple shown at 0.57 seconds in the posted video, it was found that there are many differences between both the temples, which can be seen in the collage below.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, the posted video is not related to the Tirupati temple, it is a video of Ranganathaswamy temple in New York.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
