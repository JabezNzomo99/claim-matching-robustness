It\u2019s an average of all working-age households, from the poorest to the richest, ignoring whether anyone in the house is actually employed.\n\nSimilarly, the average one-earner couple with children stands to lose around \u00a31,400. But again, it doesn\u2019t matter how much they earn and we\u2019re only talking about one kind of \u201cworking family\u201d.\n\nFamilies where both parents work or lone parents, for example, will be affected very differently.", "lang": "en"}
