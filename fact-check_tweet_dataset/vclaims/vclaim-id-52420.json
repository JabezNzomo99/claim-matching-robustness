Thousands of soldiers from China and India have faced off with each other in Ladakh\u2019s Galwan Valley in recent weeks, with at least 20 Indian soldiers dying in a June 16 confrontation, BBC News reported.\n\nThe image\u2019s Facebook caption, which vaguely mimics the style of a breaking news alert, alleges that recently \u201cChina #installed this banner in #Ladakh.\u201d The photo has also been shared on Twitter with similar claims. (RELATED: Has India\u2019s Government Banned People From Posting About COVID-19 On Social Media?)\n\nHowever, the photo isn\u2019t recent, and China didn\u2019t erect the banner pictured in it. In October 2012, Australian photographer Daniel Berehulak took the photo, which can be found on Getty Images. It shows a banner put up by the Indian military in the disputed region, according to its caption.\n\n\u201cAn Indian Military banner post is seen on the road to Pangong Lake on October 5, 2012 near to Leh, Ladakh, India,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cLadakh, nestled between the Kunlun mountain range in the north and the main Great Himalayas to the south, was once an ancient Buddhist Kingdom and for over half a century now, a strategic military outpost for India. Ladakh, sharing borders with both China and Pakistan, has seen an increase in tourism over the last few years, an alternative to Nepali Himalayan treks.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
