It was wrong then. It\u2019s wrong now.\n\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThere is no context to the image and we could not track down the original. Nevertheless, the story\u2019s message is wrong.\n\nThe article\u2019s content seems to suggest that the Democratic Party\u2019s support of the gay community, Muslims, and the successful bids of Democratic Muslim congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ihan Omar is reason enought to claim that the party is aiming to make pedophilia legal.\n\nThere is no evidence that any U.S. politician, liberal or otherwise, is trying to make pedophilia legal or that they are pushing any sort of religious views or laws.\n\nThe claim is inaccurate and ridiculous.
