Severe mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are also counted as pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe post refers to a figure in the image of 0.0024%, which it says is the death rate. This figure is not official data. It has been added to the official data spreadsheet by someone after it was published by NHS England.\n\nThe image says the figure was calculated by dividing the number of deaths from Covid-19 of people with no pre-existing conditions by the total population of England. This is not a \u201cdeath rate\u201d and doesn\u2019t mean much. This figure doesn\u2019t include deaths outside of hospitals, and it makes an unfair comparison between the number of people who died without pre-existing conditions, with the total population, many of whom will also have pre-existing conditions.\n\nAlso by underplaying deaths of people with pre-existing conditions, this might suggest that people with them do not die of Covid-19 but just with it. That\u2019s not correct. As we\u2019ve written before, Covid-19 is identified as the underlying cause in over 90% of the deaths of people who had the disease mentioned on their death certificate.\n\nSo it\u2019s not appropriate to exclude all deaths of people with pre-existing conditions from such a \u201cdeath rate\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
