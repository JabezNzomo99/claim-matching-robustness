A New York Times article published an article on 11 April 2017, for instance, reported that the White House may be unprepared for the annual event:\n\nPresident Trump received an urgent warning in February, informing him of a crucial date he was about to miss. \u201cFYI manufacturing deadlines for the Easter eggs are near,\u201d said a Twitter post directed at Mr. Trump; the first lady, Melania Trump; and the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump. \u201cPlease reach out!\u201d The message came from Wells Wood Turning & Finishing, the company that supplies commemorative wooden eggs for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, the 138-year-old celebration that has drawn 35,000 people to the South Lawn in recent years. The staff of the company, based in Buckfield, Me., wondered whether the Trumps planned to continue distributing the wooden eggs as party favors, or whether they were even going to have a White House Easter Egg Roll at all.\n\nThe Hill also reported that President Trump would be spending at least part of Easter weekend at Mar-a-Lago and not the White House:\n\nPresident Trump plans on returning to Mar-a-Lago, his luxury resort in Palm Beach, Fla., this coming Easter weekend. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be here for Easter,\u201d he said at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Fla., according to The Palm Beach Daily News. \u201cIs Easter next week?\u201d Trump added when pressed on his schedule. \u201cWell then, I guess I\u2019ll be back next week.\u201d\n\nSome people may have also been confused by the cancellation of a local Easter Egg hunt in Pennsylvania.\n\nWith reports circulating that the White House was struggling to organize the event, that Trump was possibly spending the holiday at Mar-a-Lago, and the unrelated news about the cancellation of a local Easter egg hunt, it\u2019s not surprising that some mistakenly assumed that the White House had cancelled the Easter Egg Roll. However, the event is still listed on the White House web site and no official announcements have been made about its potential cancellation:\n\nJoin us on Monday, April 17th, 2017, for the 139th White House Easter Egg Roll! We will be live-streaming from the South Lawn of the White House, so you can follow along with the reading nook, music stage, official egg roll, and other fun events. The White House Easter Egg Roll is a timeless White House tradition, dating back to 1878 and the presidency of President Rutherford B. Hayes. President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are honored to continue the traditions of the past, while weaving new traditions into the fabric of our Nation\u2019s history.\n\nNotably, the event is scheduled for the Monday after Easter Sunday. Although Trump may spend the Easter Holiday at Mar-a-Lago, he is still scheduled to be at the White House on Monday for the annual event.\n\nAs of this writing, the White House Easter Egg Roll is still scheduled to go on as planned.", "lang": "en"}
