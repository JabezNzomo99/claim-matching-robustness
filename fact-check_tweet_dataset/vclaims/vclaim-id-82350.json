At 26:40 minutes he can be heard attributing this information to Huffington Post.\n\nPatra makes the claim to support his argument that the Indian National Congress is a party of thieves.

What work has Sonia Gandhi done to become the 4th richest woman in the world? You tell me what industry does she own? What plantations does she own?\u2026I want Congress\u2019s spokesperson to answer this question today.)\u201d\n\nOn November 29, 2013, Huffington Post had published a story on the richest world leaders and placed Sonia Gandhi in the 12th position (not 4th as claimed by Patra). However, the former INC President\u2019s name was subsequently removed from the story as the information\u2019s source, as clarified later by Huffington Post, was \u201ccalled into question.\u201d\n\nA December 2013 report by India Todayhad found that Huffington Post\u2019s claims about Gandhi\u2019s net worth were based on a report published by a website called Celebrity Net Worthwhich routinely writes on celebrity finances.\n\nAccording to the website, \u201cShe (Sonia Gandhi) personally states her wealth to be between $200,000 and $500,000, but several sources including OpenSecrets.org and Business Insider have estimated that Sonia\u2019s actual wealth could be as low as $2 billion and might be as high as $19 billion.\u201d\n\nAlt News had investigated OpenSecrets.org and Business Insider in the past when union women and child development minister Maneka Gandhi had made a similar claim about the former Congress president and her sister-in-law.\n\nIn a March 2, 2012 report titled \u2013 \u2018Meet The 23 Richest Politicians In The World\u2019 \u2013 Business Insider placed Gandhi 4th in the list, with the article claiming that her net worth was between US$ 2-19 billion.\n\nThe Business Insider story hyperlinked a website named \u2018World\u2019s Luxury Guide\u2019 as its source. It also said that there are some disputes about Gandhi\u2019s actual net worth and that the\u2018National Election Watch\u2019put the same at US$200,000 (approximately Rs 1.35 crores at that time).\n\nThe website \u2018World\u2019s Luxury Guide\u2019 has been taken down since over a year. Accessing an archived version of the \u2018list of richest leaders\u2019 created by the website revealed that it also placed Sonia Gandhi at the 4th place. \u2018World\u2019s Luxury Guide\u2019 had provided opensecret.org, forbes.com, bloomberg.com, wikipedia.org and guardian.co.uk as its sources.\n\nForbes had published an article in 2011 titled \u2013 \u2018India\u2019s 100 Richest\u2019 \u2013 which does not include Gandhi\u2019s name. In 2012, The Guardianhad published a report on the world\u2019s richest leaders, however, it too did not include Gandhi. On Bloomberg, Alt News back-searched till 2010 but found nothing of relevance. The remaining attribution provided by Business Insider \u2013OpenSecret \u2013 has never written any report on the former Congress President.\n\nThus, none of the sources enlisted by \u2018World\u2019s Luxury Guide\u2019 had the data to back up the claim of Sonia Gandhi being the world\u2019s 4th richest politician. Moreover, the name of the website itself should indicate that it is not a source that could be trusted.\n\nAlt News had debunked this last year as well when a similar claim was widespread on social media.\n\nThe other source mentioned by Business Insider was \u2018National Election Watch,\u2019 claiming that it put Sonia Gandhi\u2019s net worth at US$200,000 (approximately Rs 1.37 crore in 2012).\n\nAccessing the link redirected us to a report that provided the assets declared by Gandhi before 2004, 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The latest figures (2014) put her net worth at over Rs 9.28 crore. As the Business Insider article was published in 2012, it must have referred to the figures Gandhi had disclosed in 2009 \u2013 Rs 1.37 crore. This matched the \u201cdisputed net worth\u201d claims on Business Insider.\n\nThe evidence at hand suggests that the claims that Sonia Gandhi\u2019s net worth is between $2-19 billion are unfounded. Earlier this month, BJP spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay had also made the incorrect assertion, quoting a 6-year-old Times of India story based on the Huffington Post article.", "lang": "en"}
