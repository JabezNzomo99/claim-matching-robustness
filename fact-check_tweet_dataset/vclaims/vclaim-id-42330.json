Paying 'deferential obeisance' to the army. Here, the deferential obeisance bears a sarcastic connotation.\n\nThe old video being circulated in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack has been shared from many pages.\n\nA simple Google search with the keywords '\u00ddogi laughing at funeral' leads to several links with the same video.\n\nThe original video is from the funeral of former Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand chief minister ND Tiwari. Back then the video was widely shared on social media and had proved to be a major embarrassment for the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nYou can watch the original video below.\n\nNews reports on the incident can be accessed here and here.\n\nWhile the video had been circulated widely in 2018, it has been finding its way back on social media once again after the Pulwama tragedy.", "lang": "en"}
