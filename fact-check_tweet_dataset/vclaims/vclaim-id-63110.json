Sir saludo 'ko sa inyo! Bus, COVID kits, donation binibigay niya. Kahit lagi siyang tampulan ng katatawanan sa socmed, kahit kinicriticize siya dahil sa level ng pinag-aralan niya, pinatunayan niyang may ibubuga siya. Siya lang ang may puso talaga sa mga senador... Long live Sir! God bless.\"\n\nThe Jack Ma Foundation partnered with the Manny Pacquiao Foundation to donate over 50,000 coronavirus testing kits to the Philippines. The Manny Pacquiao Foundation also donated 700,000 masks to the Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines, Metro Manila Development Authority, Department of Social Welfare and Development, and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).\n\nThe facts: Other senators, and not just Pacquiao, also responded to the outbreak by providing aid to frontliners and those affected by the enhanced community quarantine, among others.\n\nSenators, as part of Congress, are tasked to craft laws and legislate \u2013 not execute \u2013 policies. Nevertheless, aside from Pacquiao, a number of them also initiated projects to help support communities and frontliners affected by COVID-19.\n\nSome senators, like Cynthia Villar, Pia Cayetano, Sonny Angara, Win Gatchalian and Bong Revilla Jr, distributed relief packs and supplies to affected sectors and/or frontliners in their respective jurisdictions. Senator Francis \"Kiko\" Pangilinan started an initiative to link farmers with local government units and non-governmental organizations.\n\nOthers like senators Richard \"Dick\" Gordon and Grace Poe distributed medical supplies to various hospitals in Metro Manila. Senator Ronald \"Bato\" Dela Rosa also donated personal protective equipment to health workers in Laguna, while Senator Imee Marcos filed 3 bills in relation to the coronavirus outbreak.", "lang": "en"}
