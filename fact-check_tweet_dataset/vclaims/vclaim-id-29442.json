No, neither is true: An ICE official denies there is such a quarantine and he said the claim about a young girl being raped by many men is an old false story he has previously debunked.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Big League Politics on June 26, 2019 titled \"Texas Medical Professional: Migrants Quarantined with UNKNOWN Disease, 10-Year Old Girl Found With 20 Types of Semen In Her\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nRoger Maier, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Texas, told Lead Stories that there \"is no unknown disease outbreak\" among migrants and none are being treated in quarantine at a privately-owned hospital in El Paso, Texas.\n\nICE did place thousands of adult immigrants in quarantine last month because of mumps and chicken pox exposure, according to CNN:\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement has placed 5,200 adult immigrants in quarantine after being exposed to mumps or chicken pox, a dramatic jump from just a few months ago, the agency says.\n\n\n\nICE has recorded cases of either mumps or chicken pox in 39 immigrant detention centers nationwide, an ICE official tells CNN.\n\n\n\nOf the 5,200 detainees in quarantine across those centers, around 4,200 are for exposure to mumps. Around 800 were exposed to chicken pox and 100 have been exposed to both.\n\nThe fake claim about a child being raped by as many as 20 men is not a new fabrication:\n\n\"There was a female, 10 years old, who was found with 20 different types of semen inside her body. She was dispatched to a family member. The girl who was with her who was supposedly a family member was not really a family member, just someone who bought her from her family in Guatemala. These are real problems that exist here on the border. There are some people who are trying to leave jugs of water out here for them. A lot of these people come to this country needing help,\" the professional stated.\n\nMaier expressed frustration at having to again deny that the semen of many men had been found in a young immigrant girl. \"That story was going around a few months ago and we have nothing to substantiate that.\" The U.S. Customs and Border Protection official was referring to a story debunked by Lead Stories in December, 2018 titled \"Fake News: Border Patrol Agents Did NOT Find Body Of 6-Year-Old Girl Raped By 30 Men.\"\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not immediately respond to Lead Stories' inquiry, but we know they are busy fighting real disease outbreaks around the world, not just viral fake news contracted through contact with social platforms. But on July 3, 2019 Bert Kelly from the CDC media office confirmed to us via email that the \"CDC does not have anyone in quarantine at this time\".\n\nBig League Politics has not yet responded to Lead Stories' request for more information about their sourcing for the claims, such as has the website checked the credentials of the purported medical professional and what other actions did they take to verify the story.
