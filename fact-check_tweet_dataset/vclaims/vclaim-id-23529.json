(Video of the event can be viewed here.)\n\nObama was in attendance at the event, appearing many times in the video itself. However, she was wearing a different dress with a much higher neckline than the woman shown in the original image, sporting curled hair in contrast to the other woman\u2019s straighter hairstyle.\n\nIn addition, the image actually shows attendees standing with their hands over their hearts during a performance of the National Anthem, rather than the Pledge of Allegiance. During this performance, Obama stood on the stage, not on the main floor of the event where the woman in the picture is standing. Obama placed her hand over her heart during the rendition of the anthem.\n\nThe woman in the image is actually Washington Post columnist Helena Andrews. After receiving backlash for being on her phone, she responded via Twitter, saying she had been taking notes, not texting, when she appeared on camera.\n\n\n\n The meme has circulated on social media for years, first appearing not long after the event aired.", "lang": "en"}
