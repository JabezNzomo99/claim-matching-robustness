Upon reverse-searching the image, we came across the same photograph on the website of Nithyananda, www.nithyananda.org in July 2017. The person in the picture is Mr. Jagdishwar Goburdhun, the High Commissioner of Mauritius to India. The photograph pertains to Guru Purnima celebrations on July 9, 2017, when a MoU was signed for the establishment of the Nithyananda Gurukul and Nithyananda University in Mauritius. Posted below is another image from the same event.\n\nThe two pictures i.e the viral image and the above image have been juxtaposed and posted below for comparison. It is evident that the person in the image is Mr. Goburdhun, the High Commissioner of Mauritius to India.\n\nIt may thus be noted that the person seen in the viral image, falling at the feet of Nithyananda, is not Home Minister Amit Shah. It is the High Commissioner of Mauritius to India. The photograph was clicked in July 2017.", "lang": "en"}
