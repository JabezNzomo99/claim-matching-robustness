It is being claimed as taken during the protests against National Register of Citizens (NRC) or Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB). Let\u2019s try to check the veracity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Images of a woman beaten during the protests of National Register of Citizens (NRC) Assam or Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB). Fact: The images are that of an incident that took place in Uttar Pradesh state in 2016. In UP\u2019s Mainpuri, the woman was first groped by two men and was then beaten by a crowd for speaking against that act. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nEarlier, the people of Assam were reported to be outraged after the exclusion of 19 lakh people from the final NRC list of Assam. And now, protests are taking place in Assam against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019. The bill seeks to provide Indian citizenship to specific religious groups facing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. \n\n\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to the Google reverse image search technique, a search result thus obtained lead us to an article of \u2018India Times\u2019 that carried both the images seen in the post. As per the article, the woman was beaten up by a crowd in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Mainpuri after she has spoken against two men who groped her. This incident took place in 2016. So, the photos are that of an incident in UP and are in no way related to any of the protests in the state of Assam.\n\nEarlier, when the same images were shared with a claim that the woman was beaten by police, \u2018FACTLY\u2019 had debunked it and that article can be seen here. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, the images in the post aren\u2019t related to any protests against National Register of Citizens (NRC) or Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB). \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
