The number of people in employment is at a near record level at 32 million, as is the employment rate at 75%. We\u2019ve looked more into what kinds of jobs those are before.\n\nThe UK unemployment rate in April to June this year\u2014the latest period we have comparable EU figures for\u2014was 4.3%. That\u2019s just under half of the Eurozone average of 9%. These figures cover people aged between 15 and 74.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of all \u2018economically active\u2019 people. \u2018Economically active\u2019 means people who are either in work or who want to be. So it doesn\u2019t count people who aren\u2019t in work, but aren\u2019t actively seeking it either, like retirees.\n\nThe Eurozone is made up of EU countries which use the Euro. It includes Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.\n\nThe UK has been doing much better in recent years compared to the Eurozone average than it has done for decades. The UK has always had a lower unemployment rate, coming closest in autumn 2011 when the UK rate hit 8.5%, with the Eurozone at 9.8%. Latvia and Lithuania weren\u2019t part of the Eurozone back then.\n\nSome countries with the Euro still have slightly lower rates. Germany, for example, has had a consistently lower rate than the UK since the 2009 recession.", "lang": "en"}
