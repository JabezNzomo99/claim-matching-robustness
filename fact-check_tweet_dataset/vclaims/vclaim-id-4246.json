One survey estimated 20% of UK female workers experienced sexual harassment.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-4246", "url": "https://fullfact.org/crime/sexual-harassment-workplace/", "vclaim": "A survey last month found that about a third of women had experienced sexual harassment at work. It also found that 46% of women experiencing bullying or harassment of any kind (not just sexual harassment) had reported it. We believe this was the source for the claim though haven\u2019t been able to contact Ms Hirsch to confirm.\n\nThe study also surveyed men and looked more widely at unwanted workplace behaviour, not just sexual harassment.\n\nThis study only surveyed members of the Prospect union, which focuses on professionals, managers and craftspeople, and so isn\u2019t representative of UK workers generally.\n\nOther estimates for sexual harassment vary a lot depending on whether the survey question specifies acts of sexual harassment, or leaves the respondent to define sexual harassment themselves.\n\nOne survey estimated that 20% of women in the UK currently working reported experiencing sexual harassment in the workplace, leaving it up to the respondents to interpret what they considered sexual harassment. Of those women, 58% had never reported instances of sexual harassment to their employer or someone in authority at work. A further 28% had reported some instances but not others.\n\nSome men also experience sexual harassment. One survey estimated that 7% of men had experienced workplace sexual harassment and 56% of those men had reported at least one instance of it. For the rest of the article we concentrate on the female experience of workplace sexual harassment as the claim from Question Time did.\n\nDefining sexual harassment has a big effect on how large the problem appears to be\n\nSexual harassment in the workplace often goes unreported, which means the best available source of data to understand the scale of the issue is asking people anonymously in surveys.\n\nOver the past year, many pollsters have published surveys on this, and the results vary considerably from 20% of women reporting that they\u2019ve experienced sexual harassment at work to 53%.\n\nOne of the key things that affects the results appears to be whether surveys define sexual harassment. In surveys that don\u2019t specify what sexual harassment is, the proportion of people saying they have experienced it are lower.\n\nSexual harassment is legally defined as when one person subjects another to unwanted conduct of a sexual nature leading to violation of dignity, or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.\n\nSome surveys give specific examples of things that constitute sexual harassment, like \u201cinappropriate jokes\u201d which isn\u2019t as clear cut against the legal definition. For example, there\u2019s evidence that inappropriate sexual jokes are not considered sexual harassment by 30% of women.\n\nOne pollster, ComRes, surveyed UK adults in October and found 53% of women had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace or place of study, but in December found only 25% had.\n\nThe key difference in the surveys was that in the October study, they defined sexual harassment, but in December left it up to the respondents to decide whether the behaviour they may have encountered constituted sexual harassment.\n\nThe inclusion of \u201cplace of study\u201d in these surveys also means the results are likely higher than if they had looked solely at workplace harassment.\n\nWho you survey also makes a difference\n\nIt\u2019s also difficult to put a precise number on workplace harassment, as many surveys look at different groups. The data referenced during Question Time seems to refer to a survey of working current members of the Prospect union, and so isn\u2019t representative of the working population as a whole.\n\nA survey done by Opinium in September surveyed people currently working in the UK, meaning they excluded people who are retired.\n\nComRes surveyed a sample of all adults in Britain, meaning they interviewed some retired people who had worked previously, but also may well have included people that had never worked. This could have the effect of underestimating the proportion of people experiencing workplace sexual harassment. That\u2019s because by surveying a group of people who have never worked, you dilute the numbers of people who have experienced workplace sexual harassment.\n\nThe reporting of sexual harassment is inconsistent\n\nEstimates for how many women don\u2019t report workplace sexual harassment also vary, but the figure of 70% seems to be in the right ballpark.\n\nThe Opinium survey of UK workers found 58% of women never reported instances of sexual harassment and another 28% sometimes reported sexual harassment.\n\nThe ComRes survey from November 2017 found 71% of women didn\u2019t report sexual harassment\u2014but this survey didn\u2019t allow for women to say they had reported some instances but not others. The only answer options were essentially \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d.\n\nWhat none of these surveys tell us is why women do not report all instances of sexual harassment.", "lang": "en"}
