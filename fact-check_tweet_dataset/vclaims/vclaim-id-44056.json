The claim is false, the image has been doctored from an original picture.\n\nThe image in this post uploaded on January 17 appears to show Trillanes wearing a black polo shirt with the characters \u201cDU30\u201d written in white on its right side during a trip to the city of Davao, the president\u2019s hometown.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, translated into English, says: \u201cYou just went to Davao you're already wearing something with \u2018DU30\u2019 on it. But when you criticize the president, you do it ceaselessly\u201d.\n\nThe original image shows Trillanes wearing the same black polo shirt, but the right-hand side is blank and no \u201cDU30\u201d can be seen.\n\nThe caption of the News5 post, when translated to English, says: \u201cLOOK: Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV arrived at Davao RTC Branch 54 to face the libel case filed against him by former vice mayor Pulong Duterte and Atty. Mans Carpio\u201d.\n\nA libel case has been filed against Trillanes by Duterte\u2019s son, former Davao city vice mayor Paolo Duterte, also known as Pulong.\n\nA report by local news organisation ABS-CBN about the case also showed Trillanes wearing the same black polo shirt without \u201cDU30\u201d on it.
