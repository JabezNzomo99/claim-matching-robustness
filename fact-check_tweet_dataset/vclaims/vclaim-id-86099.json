That role has thrust Azar into a high-profile role since a federal judge issued the Trump administration a 30-day deadline \u2014 expiring July 26 \u2014 to quickly reunite as many separated families as possible.\n\nTwo of the 100 shelters are temporary shelters, in Tornillo, Tex., and Homestead, Fla., which were recently expanded after the Trump policy went into effect. An HHS official said that after the migrant crisis in 2014, which overwhelmed HHS facilities, the agency put in place a way to rapidly expand such facilities in response to a huge influx. Tornillo, for instance, has been used in the past as a shelter for hurricane survivors.\n\nThe ad notes that Azar is \u201cnow in charge\u201d and shows him saying: \u201cIt is one of the great acts of American generosity and charity what we are doing for unaccompanied kids.\u201d Images flash of the Tornillo and Homestead facilities, depicting gates and beds in a row. The narrator intones that \u201cthis is a disgrace\u201d and urges viewers to call Congress and hold Azar accountable.\n\nThe clear implication is that Azar was saying the treatment of children under the zero-tolerance policy was an act of generosity. But, in fact, he made this statement in the context of explaining to Blitzer that it was difficult to let television crews into the facilities because of privacy concerns.\n\nAzar: \u201cWolf, our mission is protect child welfare. I\u2019m sorry if it doesn\u2019t work for a TV camera angle. I\u2019m sorry. At the end of the day, these are minor children, if they\u2019re in our custody, we are going to look out for their welfare and treat them with the respect, the privacy that they deserve. And we\u2019ll be as transparent as possible, consistent with that.\u201d\n\nBlitzer: \u201cThey deserve that privacy. I\u2019m just saying, we would guarantee that they would blur their faces. No one would see the kids\u2019 faces. We just want to go in and do our job. If there is nothing to hide, I don\u2019t see what the problem would be.\u201d\n\nAzar: \u201cWolf, we are happy to work, we want to be transparent. We have nothing to hide about how we operate these facilities, our grantees. It is one of the great acts of American generosity and charity what we are doing for unaccompanied kids who are smuggled into our country or come across illegally. So, we don\u2019t have anything to hide about it. We just have to protect privacy. We\u2019ll be happy to work with you to see if there are ways to accommodate that. It is not about hiding it. It\u2019s about how do we fulfill our mission of reuniting the kids that are under this court order first. How do we protect their privacy and how do we protect our grantees as they do their work.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the interview, Azar said: \u201cI\u2019ve got 12,029 kids in our custody right now, and the vast, vast majority, close to 10,000 of them, were sent by their parents or escaped from their parents to come to this country alone. Some of them came in this country illegally and were separated at the border. Some long ago. Some as part of zero-tolerance. And, Wolf, what we do is we provide as caring an environment. They get education. They\u2019re getting athletics. They\u2019re getting entertainment. They get medical care, dental care, mental health care, vision care. They\u2019re getting snacks.\u201d\n\nAs of July 23, HHS told the court that it had reunited or \u201cappropriately discharged\u201d 1,187 of the 2,551 children ages 5 and older, with a total of 1,634 possibly eligible for reunification; the government also has reunited 57 out of 103 children who are under the age of 5, with 46 found to be ineligible because parents were already deported, were found to have serious criminal history or other reasons.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, Azar did this interview to discuss his agency\u2019s compliance with a court order on the \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy,\u201d said Mary Alice Carter, executive director of Equity Forward. \u201cCNN did not invite him on to discuss the history HHS has with placing kids with foster care. If he gets to claim that all of the locations have kids that are \u2018happy\u2019 and \u2018getting snacks\u2019 we need to highlight the fact that some of these facilities are tents on military bases behind massive fence enclosures.\u201d\n\nAt the Fact Checker, we have a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard and believe most viewers would conclude from the ad that he said the treatment of immigrant children under the zero-tolerance policy was a great act of \u201cAmerican generosity and charity.\u201d Instead, he was talking more broadly about the agency\u2019s treatment of children at 100 facilities across the country.
