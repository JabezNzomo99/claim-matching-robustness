The claim originated with a satirical article.\n\nThe movement of professional athletes kneeling during the national anthem reignited after George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis police custody, according to The New York Times. Numerous athletes have in recent weeks engaged in similar forms of peaceful protest during the national anthem, with players from two WNBA teams walking out on July 25, for instance.\n\nThe image claims WNBA players also issued an ultimatum: \u201cIt\u2019s either us or the flag.\u201d Featured above what appears to be a headline are two pictures, one of female basketball players and one of the iconic raising of the American Flag at Iwo Jima during World War II.\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any record of WNBA collectively making the ultimatum on the Women\u2019s National Basketball Players Association website or its Twitter account. Such a move almost certainly would have made headlines, yet there does not appear to be any credible reporting about it.\n\nThe inaccurate claim seems to stem from an article, published on the satirical website The Glorious American, that contains the same headline and photos as the image being shared. The Glorious American describes itself as a \u201cFake News publication\u201d and uses the tagline \u201cSatire For The Right. And The Wrong.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post fails to convey the satirical origins, a common way misinformation spreads on social media. We rate the claim false.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
