Or, put another way, in even more plain English, if you are a millionaire in Australia, you will get an $11,000 tax cut from the Morrison government in 2024. If you are someone who earns $40,000, you get $11 a week.\u201d\n\nALP leader Bill Shorten has accused the Morrison government of \u201chiding\u201d $77 billion in tax cuts for the biggest-earning taxpayers, at the cost of everyday Australians. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the Labor leader\u2019s claims that $77 billion in tax cuts would go to the top three per cent of taxpayers resulting in millionaires saving $11,000 per year from 2024 while someone earning $40,000 per year would save only $11 a week.\n\nMr Shorten\u2019s office told AAP FactCheck the source of his claim was an Australia Institute April 2019 report titled \u2018A bit rich: A Government plan to make tax less progressive\u2019.\n\nThe Australia Institute is an independent think-tank that researches economic, social, transparency and environmental issues and states it has no formal political or commercial ties. [2]\n\nWhile the details of the government\u2019s tax plan were clearly laid out in the budget, the impact of the changes were revealed in the Australia Institute\u2019s analysis.\n\nThe report found most of the benefit of the government\u2019s tax plan will go to high income earners. \u201cThe tax plan will see the proportion of tax paid by high income earners fall and the proportion of tax paid by low and middle income earners rise,\u201d the report said. [3]\n\nIt found taxpayers earning more than $180,000 per year will get at least $77 billion worth of tax cuts over 10 years from 2024-25 when the Morrison government's tax cuts are fully implemented. It also found the majority of that money - $64 billion - will go to those earning more than $200,000. [3]\n\nRegarding Mr Shorten\u2019s claim that the $77 billion hidden in the budget will go to the top three per cent of taxpayers, Australian Tax Office 2016-17 statistics show 3.1 per cent of taxpayers have taxable incomes above $180,001. [4]\n\nBased on the Australia Institute\u2019s analysis and 2016-17 ATO figures, Mr Shorten\u2019s claim the top three per cent will get $77 billion in tax cuts is true.\n\nHowever, the Australia Institute calculates on page 11 that over time the percentage of high income earners will rise. People earning more than $180,000 will make up the top 10 per of taxpayers by 2024-25, and those earning more than $200,000 a year will be in the top eight per cent of taxpayers [3].\n\nA spokesperson for Mr Shorten said he was referring to taxpayers with more than $1 million of annual personal income when making his statement.\n\nAccording to the government\u2019s \u2018Tax Relief Estimator\u2019, someone earning $1 million a year will be $11,640 better off by 2024-25, while a person with $40,000 of annual personal income will get a tax cut of $580. That equates to $11.15 per week. [5]\n\nAgain, Mr Shorten\u2019s claims on the comparative savings for the two groups from the government\u2019s tax plan is correct.\n\nAAP FactCheck found Mr Shorten\u2019s claim to be mostly true, with the one error being he understated the percentage of high-income earners who will benefit, which will be up to 10 per cent by 2024-25.", "lang": "en"}
