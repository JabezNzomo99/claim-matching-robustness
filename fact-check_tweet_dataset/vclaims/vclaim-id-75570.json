See The Hindu's 2015 story.\n\nGurdeep Singh Sappal, officer on special duty to the Vice-President. tweeted: \u201cWhen National anthem is played, Principal Dignitary & persons in uniform take salute. Those in civil dress stand in attention.\u201d He explained that at the Republic Day parade, the President of India, as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, takes the salute and by protocol, the Vice-President is required to stand in attention.\" - The Hindu\n\n\u201cWhen the Vice-President is the Principal Dignitary, he salutes during National Anthem, wearing a head gear,\u201d Mr. Sappal said in his tweet. When the National Anthem is played, those in civil dress stand in attention and as per the Flag Code of India, all persons present should face the flag and stand in attention.\"\n\nThis is supported in the Orders Relating To The National Anthem Of India and The Flag Code of India, 2002.\n\nThe national anthem, national flag, the Constitution and national symbols are protected by the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.\n\nIf we skip back to orders relating to the national anthem, a document available on the Ministry of Home Affairs' website, it details orders relating to the length and duration of the anthem along with orders that are to be followed during civil and military ceremonies. (Click here to view the entire document.)\n\nUnder orders relating to when the full version of the anthem should be played on civil and military investitures, it states -\n\n\"When National Salute (which means the Command \u201cRashtriya Salute \u2013 Salami Shastr\u201d to the accompaniment of the National Anthem is given on ceremonial occasions to the President or to the Governor/Lieutenant Governor within their respective States/Union Territories\"\n\nAlso see Strict compliance of Orders Relating to the National Anthem of India.\n\nThe Flag Code of India, 2002 is a compilation of the laws, conventions, instructions and guidance related to the display of the national flag. (Click here to view the entire Code)\n\nSection VI of the code says that during a ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag or when the flag is passing in a parade, all persons should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute.\n\n\"During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the Flag or when the Flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the Flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute.\"\n\nTherefore what all of this means is that only in the absence of the president, the vice president would be considered the principal dignitary and take the national salute.", "lang": "en"}
