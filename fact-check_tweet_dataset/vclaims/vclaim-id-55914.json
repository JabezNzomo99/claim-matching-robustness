His real Twitter handle is \u201c@MarcusRashford\u201d, whereas the one that tweeted at her is \u201c@MarcusRashforrd\u201d. As well as an extra \u2018r\u2019, it doesn\u2019t have the blue verification tick after his name, just an emoji.\n\nHowever, the fake account has used the same display name and profile picture as his real Twitter account, which seems to have led to confusion.\n\nKatie Hopkins\u2019 Twitter account has since been suspended by Twitter, but it doesn\u2019t seem that the real Marcus Rashford had ever tweeted at her.", "lang": "en"}
