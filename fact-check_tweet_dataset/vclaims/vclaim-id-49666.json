It is unusual to have something that far up your nose - the swab can feel itchy or tickly but it shouldn't be painful,\" says Dr Tom Wingfield of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\n\nThe full Washington Post article, which was published in June, details the findings of a federal review which found that faulty tests and lab procedures caused delays to the rollout of the CDC's testing programme. It doesn't suggest that faulty test kits could have passed on the virus to any patients.\n\nFact checkers in the US and India have debunked wilder claims that the coronavirus test is a plot funded by the Gates Foundation to implant a microchip into patients. These false claims, shared thousands of times on Facebook, are similar to conspiracy theories we looked into previously about a sinister micro-chipping programme linked to a potential vaccine.\n\n'Why can't you just breathe on the swab?'\n\nA meme asking, \"If Covid was really carried on your breath, why can't you just breathe on the swab?
