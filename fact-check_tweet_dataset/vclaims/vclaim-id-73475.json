One criticized Trump for being \u201cwrong\u201d about hydroxychloroquine, and the other acknowledged that a study had found hydroxychloroquine helpful in treating coronavirus patients:\n\nHowever, these articles were not contradictory in content, and they were presented in a misleading manner in the above example to make them seem so.\n\nThe first article, published on April 11, 2020, and written by Elizabeth Cohen and Dr. Minali Nigam, was headlined \u201cPresident Trump is wrong in so many ways about hydroxychloroquine studies. Here are the facts.\u201d This article did not assert that hydroxychloroquine had no value whatsoever as a treatment for the coronavirus disease. Rather, it pointed out four specific ways in which Trump had made claims about hydroxychloroquine studies that were contrary to what doctors were expressing about the subject at the time:\n\n1) How soon until we know if hydroxychloroquine works against coronavirus? Trump says \u201cdays.\u201d Doctors say weeks or months. 2) French researchers have already done a clinical study showing hydroxychloroquine works as a treatment for coronavirus. Doesn\u2019t that tell us something? Trump says yes. Doctors say the study was terrible, so no. 3) Have some people tried to delay hydroxychloroquine clinical trials? Trump says yes, and he came to the rescue. Doctors say they have no idea what he\u2019s talking about. 4) Is hydroxychloroquine safe for coronavirus patients? Trump says yes. Doctors say the drug can have serious side effects.\n\nThe second article, published on July 3 2020, and written by Maggie Fox, Andrea Kane, and Elizabeth Cohen, had its headline deceptively truncated in the above example to remove the skepticism it expressed about a recent hydroxychloroquine study. The full headline read \u201cStudy finds hydroxychloroquine may have boosted survival, but other researchers have doubts,\u201d and the text of the article detailed the dispute over the study\u2019s findings:\n\nA surprising new study found the controversial antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine helped patients better survive in the hospital. But the findings, like the federal government\u2019s use of the drug itself, were disputed. A team at Henry Ford Health System in southeast Michigan said their study of 2,541 hospitalized patients found that those given hydroxychloroquine were much less likely to die. t\u2019s a surprising finding because several other studies have found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine, a drug originally developed to treat and prevent malaria. President Donald Trump touted the drug heavily, but later studies found not only did patients not do better if they got the drug, they were more likely to suffer cardiac side effects. Researchers not involved in the Henry Ford study pointed out it wasn\u2019t of the same quality of the studies showing hydroxychloroquine did not help patients, and said other treatments, such as the use of the steroid dexamethasone, might have accounted for the better survival of some patients \u2026 They noted that the Henry Ford team did not randomly treat patients but selected them for various treatments based on certain criteria. [Eli Rosenberg, associate professor of epidemiology at the University at Albany School of Public Health] also pointed out that the Detroit paper excluded 267 patients \u2014 nearly 10% of the study population \u2014 who had not yet been discharged from the hospital. He said this might have skewed the results to make hydroxychloroquine look better than it really was. Those patients might have still been in the hospital because they were very sick, and if they died, excluding them from the study made hydroxychloroquine look like more of a lifesaver than it really was. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of loosey-goosiness here in all this,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nOther analyst likewise found the hydroxychloroquine study referenced by CNN to be dubious, for similar reasons:\n\nThe study that sparked the latest controversy was anything but randomized. Not only was it not randomized, outside experts noted, but patients who received hydroxychloroquine were also more likely to get steroids, which appear to help very sick patients with Covid-19. That is likely to have influenced the central finding of the Henry Ford study: that death rates were 50% lower among patients in hospitals treated with hydroxychloroquine. Evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not help hospitalized patients \u2014 the use in its original emergency use authorization, which was designed to allow doctors to access a national stockpile of the drug \u2014 is mounting. Said [Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic and a longtime clinical trialist]: \u201cThe sooner we stop talking about hydroxychloroquine, the sooner we can focus attention on more promising therapies.\u201d\n\nIn short, information about hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, published by CNN in two articles in April and July of 2020, was neither contradictory nor inaccurate \u2014 despite deceptive attempts to make it look that way.", "lang": "en"}
