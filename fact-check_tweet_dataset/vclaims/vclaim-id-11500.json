The pie chart and other similar claims were circulated after Vice President Leni Robredo demanded on October 28 that Duterte explain the country's trillion-peso debt.\n\nAs of January 2019, the outstanding cumulative debt of the national government stands at P7.49 trillion. Of the amount, P4.91 trillion is domestic or local debt, while P2.58 trillion is external or foreign debt. The amount does not include P487.3 billion in guaranteed debt, or contingent liabilities handled by government if a state agency fails to pay for its debts on time.\n\nIn general terms, a government's outstanding debt consists of the unpaid balance of loans and debt securities \u2013 whether domestic or external \u2013 explained economist JC Punongbayan. It is best understood as a \"running total\" of how much the country still owes, he added.\n\nComparisons among presidents should show the \"net addition\" or \"net increase\" to the debt during their respective terms. \"Note that at any point in time, new debt is incurred as old debt gets paid,\" said Punongbayan.\n\nFor instance, in December 2000, the last available data from the Treasury before Arroyo assumed office in January 2001, shows that the government's outstanding actual debt stood at P2.167 trillion. At the end of her term in June 2010, it went up to P4.582 trillion. Thus, the net addition to the debt after Arroyo's 9-year term was P2.416 trillion (rounded off).", "lang": "en"}
