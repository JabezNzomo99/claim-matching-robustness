The deal\u2019s sunset provisions are totally unacceptable. \u2026 \u201cIf we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen. In just a short period of time, the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world\u2019s most dangerous weapons.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Iran\u2019s military expenditure increased nearly 30 percent from 2015, when the JCPOA was adopted, to 2017. This increase brought Iran\u2019s military spending back to near-2006 levels. But as we\u2019ve pointed out before, just looking at the raw increase or decrease in any country\u2019s military budget misses important context. Instead, let\u2019s consider Iran\u2019s military expenditure as a share of overall government spending. In 2015, it accounted for 15.4 percent of government spending. It increased 0.4 percentage point, to 15.8 percent of government spending, by 2017. According to a White House official, this spending level is expected to remain stable in 2018. That means military spending increased alongside overall government spending \u2014 not in a silo on its own.\n\n\u201cAfter a period of relative stability, the rial plummeted ahead of Mr Trump\u2019s announcement on the fate of the Iran deal, losing a third of its black market value against the dollar this year alone. Compared with its level in 2015, when the nuclear deal was inked, it has lost half its value. \u201cThat tumble threatens one of the government\u2019s proudest boasts, the taming of inflation, which has declined from more than 40 per cent a year when Mr Rouhani took office in 2013 to less than 10 per cent. Today price pressures are increasing again, as the cost of imports heads upwards because of the rial\u2019s weakness. \u201cMr Rouhani\u2019s administration also emphasises its record in bringing growth back to Iran. According to official figures, the economy contracted by almost 7 per cent in the sanctions-hit year of 2012 but bounced back after the accord was signed, growing by 12.5 per cent in 2016 and 4.6 per cent last year. The business community is far from convinced by such figures, which many contend reflect an inflow of oil revenues thanks to the lifting of sanctions rather than any more genuine economic progress.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
