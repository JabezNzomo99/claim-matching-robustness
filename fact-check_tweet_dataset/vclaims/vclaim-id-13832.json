The infographic was published on the 48-months portal and makes four claims about the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY). This article is a fact check of the claims.\n\nWhat is the PMMVY?\n\nThe first claim is that the PMMVY is \u2018providing economic support to pregnant women and lactating mothers\u2019.\n\nThe Government approved pan-India implementation of Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), a centrally sponsored conditional cash transfer scheme in May. As per the information available, the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) is implementing PMMVY with the objectives of\n\u2022 providing partial compensation for the wage loss in terms of cash incentive so that the woman can take adequate rest before and after delivery of the first child; and\n\u2022 the cash incentive provided to improve health seeking behaviour amongst the Pregnant Women & Lactating Mothers (PW&LM).\n\nWhile the total number of beneficiaries enrolled for the scheme is 56.29 lakh as of December 2018, the number of beneficiaries who got paid the money are 46.54 lakh. A similar program existed during the UPA, known as the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY). The Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) was also implemented during the UPA. JSY was seen to have given positive results.\n\nWhat is the amount of cash incentive being given to pregnant women?\n\nThe second claim is that \u2018cash incentive of 6000 rupees to the pregnant/lactating women to help her recover\u2019.\n\nAccording to an answer in Lok Sabha \u2018the maternity benefit under PMMVY is available to the eligible beneficiaries for first living child of family. Normally, the first pregnancy of a woman exposes her to new kinds of challenges and stress factors. Hence, the scheme provides support to the mother for the safe delivery and immunization of her first child. Under the scheme Rs. 5,000 is provided to the eligible beneficiary in three installments. The eligible beneficiary also receives the remaining cash incentive as per approved norms towards maternity benefit under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) after institutional delivery so that on an average, a woman gets Rs.6,000\u2019.\n\nThe third claim is that it is \u2018ensuring timely check-ups\u2019. One of the three conditions of being eligible for the scheme is that the woman must have received at least on ante-natal check-up (after 6 months of pregnancy). The other two are early registration of pregnancy and registration of the child birth & vaccination of the child. The money is paid in three installments depending on the beneficiary meeting the criteria. This guarantees one check-up. The entire scheme of check-ups and other criteria is very similar to the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY).\n\nHow many women are benefitting every year?\n\nThe fourth claim is that \u2018more than 50 lakh women expected to benefit every year\u2019. The maternity benefits under PMMVY are available to the eligible beneficiaries for first living child of family. About 51.70 lakh beneficiaries are covered annually under PMMVY. However, it has to be noted that this is the expected number of beneficiaries every year and the actual number of women who received the amount could be higher or lower than 50 lakh.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
