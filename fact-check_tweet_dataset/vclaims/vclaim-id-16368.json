That\u2019s a convincing victory, for sure, but it hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from embellishing his victory.\n\nOn Nov. 27, Trump tweeted that in addition to winning the Electoral College \u201cin a landslide\u201d he also won the popular vote \u201cif you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\u201d We found no basis for Trump\u2019s claim about \u201cmillions of people who voted illegally\u201d and whether that swung the popular vote in favor of Clinton (who currently leads the popular vote tally by more than 2 million votes). But what about the claim of a landslide victory?\n\nThe following day, Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager and now a senior adviser to the president-elect, used similar language \u2014 \u201clandslide\u201d \u2014 to characterize the 306 electoral votes won by Trump.\n\nAnd Trump again used the term later the same say in a tweet criticizing CNN for reporting \u2014 correctly \u2014 that Trump\u2019s claims about illegal voters swaying the popular vote to Clinton were baseless.\n\n\n\nBut it turns out that the percentage of electoral votes won by Trump, 56.9 percent, is hardly a landslide by historic comparison.\n\nJohn Pitney, a professor of American Politics at Claremont McKenna College, put together a chart showing the Electoral College share won by every president since George Washington and found that Trump\u2019s margin of victory ranked 46th out of 58 U.S. presidential elections. (You can view the whole list below.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not true,\u201d Pitney said of Trump\u2019s \u201clandslide\u201d boast.\n\nPitney told us in a phone interview that while there\u2019s no legal definition of landslide, such a victory should have to at least be in the top half of electoral wins. \u201cAnd this doesn\u2019t come close to that,\u201d Pitney said.\n\nGeorge Washington tops the list, having carried 100 percent of the electoral vote. But one need not go so far back in history to see true landslides. Ronald Reagan carried 49 states in 1984, garnering him nearly 97.6 of the electoral vote. Richard Nixon also carried 49 states in 1972, winning 96.65 percent of the electoral vote.\n\nEven George H. W. Bush in 1988 got 426 electoral votes, which translated to over 79 percent of the electoral vote. It only seemed smaller compared to Reagan\u2019s victories, Pitney said. But Bush got a higher percentage of electoral votes than Obama did in 2008 (365 votes, or 67.84 percent), Pitney said, and \u201ceverybody was saying what a big margin Obama won by.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s margin of victory in the Electoral College is greater than George W. Bush\u2019s in 2000 or 2004, but both of those were among the tightest electoral victories in American history.\n\n\u201cTrump won. He won by a clear margin,\u201d Pitney said. \u201cBut it was no landslide by any accepted definition of that term.\u201d\n\nNate Silver of FiveThirtyEight also looked at Trump\u2019s victory in historical context and concluded it was \u201ca bit Orwellian to call it a \u2018landslide\u2019 or a \u2018blowout.'\u201d\n\nSilver found that the percentage of electoral vote won by Trump \u2014 56.9 percent \u2014 was well below the historical average, 70.9 percent. Silver found that Trump\u2019s share of electoral votes ranked 44th out of 54 elections going back to 1804. Before that, he noted, \u201cpresidential electors cast two votes each, making it hard to compare them to present-day elections.\u201d\n\nTo this, we will add the disclaimer that these calculations assume Electoral College electors on Dec. 19 will vote according to who won a plurality of votes in their state, and that recounts will not overturn any of the state results.", "lang": "en"}
