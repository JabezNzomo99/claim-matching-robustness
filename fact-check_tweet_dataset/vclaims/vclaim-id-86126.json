So far, it has added 1,306,000 jobs in 2018. But the economy added more jobs in every year of Obama\u2019s second term than it did in Trump\u2019s first year. This holds true when examining the average number of jobs added per month. (We are counting average monthly jobs created from February to January because the January data is collected the week of Jan. 12, before a president takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.)\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump argued that this measure was \u201ctotally fiction;\u201d this argument earned him Four Pinocchios. He often pointed to people who had given up looking for work to back up his claim. Looking at another variation of the unemployment rate, the U6 number, which takes this into account, unemployment was 7.4 percent in August, down from 9.2 percent when Trump took office. Still, that\u2019s a far cry from its peak \u2014 17.1 percent in October 2009.\n\nAnother indicator of economic growth is the percentage of people employed during their prime working years. In December 2009, right before the end of Obama\u2019s first year in office, 74.8 percent of adults between 25 and 54 were employed. The years 2010 and 2011 marked the indicator\u2019s low points, averaging 75.1 percent each year. But by the time Obama left office, that yearly average had rebounded to 77.9 percent. The ratio continued to climb through 2017, averaging 78.6 percent for the year, and 2018 is on track to be the best year in a decade.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump said the stock market was \u201cin a big, fat bubble.\u201d (Stocks have been rising steadily since March 2009.) But once he took office, he was first to point out any record-setting days. As we\u2019ve previously noted, Trump regularly cites data from the Dow Jones industrial average, a collection of 30 U.S. \u201cblue chip\u201d companies. But the Standards & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index provides a more nuanced data set. Comparing the S&Ps performance with similar markets since just before Trump took office, the S&P 500 (represented by the dark blue line) narrowly edged out Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index (represented by the purple line) for the largest percentage of overall growth, while the German and British markets declined (light blue and pink lines, respectively). As of midyear, the Japanese and German markets had kept pace with the United States, but in recent months, the U.S. stock market has posted gains that have put it ahead.\n\nOver the course of Obama\u2019s first year in office, GDP dropped 2.5 percent. In 2010, GDP growth recovered, surging 2.5 percent. Growth was already positive when Trump took office, jumping from 1.6 percent in 2016 to 2.2 percent in 2017. Trump might point us to quarterly GDP growth. The economy is estimated to have gained 4.2 percent in the second quarter of 2018, but that still pales in comparison with the 5.1 percent and 4.9 percent growth in the second and third quarters of 2014 under Obama.\n\nAnother measure of an economy\u2019s health is the deficit-to-GDP ratio. In other words, how much a country is earning vs. how much it is spending. The measure ballooned to 9.8 percent in 2009 when the recession was at its peak and the stimulus act was passed. By 2016, it had gone down to 3.1 percent. In Trump\u2019s first year, it went up to 3.4 percent. That\u2019s unusual, because the economy is doing well, but it reflects the impact of Trump\u2019s tax cut on government revenue. The increase in the federal deficit may make it hard for the government to respond to the next economic crisis. So if Trump is taking credit for the impact of the tax cut on economic growth, he needs to accept blame for the boost in the deficit.\n\nAnd, as we\u2019ve noted before, scholars increasingly believe that the official poverty estimate is a bit misleading and not especially informative. This is in large part because transfer payments \u2014 like the Earned Income Tax Credit or food stamps \u2014 are not recorded as income, so their impact isn\u2019t incorporated into the official figure. To assuage these concerns, the Census Bureau introduced a second poverty measure in 2011 \u2014 the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). (This also has critics.) The SPM is declining at a slower rate than the official poverty rate, dropping 2.2 points since its peak.\n\nTrump has, however, started to brag about the number of people coming off food stamps, as shorthand for people getting back to work and out of poverty. But experts say the decline isn\u2019t entirely due to better economic times. Many states have rolled back waivers that relaxed work requirements during the recession and allowed people to collect benefits for longer periods of time. There have also been reports that undocumented immigrants with children who are American citizens have stopped applying for federal assistance for fear of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nBusiness investment plunged to a low in the fourth quarter of 2015, but it rebounded to 2010 levels by the time Trump took office. It has continued to climb \u2014 gaining 2.6 percentage points, but that tracks with the upward momentum that started at the end of Obama\u2019s term. In 2017, however, the pickup was entirely in the oil and gas sector and related to rising oil prices \u2014 just as the slow investment growth in 2015 and 2016 was just in oil/gas and related to low oil prices. In 2018, the pickup has been more widespread. As with stock prices, business investment has spiked around the world.", "lang": "en"}
