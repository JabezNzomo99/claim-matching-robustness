Famous for his poems and short stories, works like \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d and \u201cThe Fall of the House of Usher\u201d continue to be widely read to this day.\n\nPoe did love cats and occasionally wrote about them. In one essay, titled \u201cInstinct vs. Reason \u2013 a Black Cat,\u201d he wrote, \u201cThe writer of this article is the owner of one of the most remarkable black cats in the world \u2013 and this saying much; for it will be remembered that black cats are all of them witches.\u201d\n\nHowever, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that the quote attributed to Poe on Facebook is genuine. A search of his complete works, listed on the Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore website, turned up no matches.\n\nA series of experts also dismissed the quote as misattributed.\n\n\u201cI have electronic versions of pretty much everything that has been attributed to Poe, including some things which have been attributed to him erroneously, and find no record of such a phrase. I find no hits even if I correct the ungrammatical \u2018mysterious\u2019 to \u2018mysteriously,'\u201d said Jeffrey A. Savoye, the secretary and treasurer of the Poe Society, in an email to TheDCNF.\n\n\u201cJust reading the sentence, it does not really sound like Poe to me anyway,\u201d he added.\n\nThe structure of the sentence also raised red flags for Amy Branam Armiento, an associate professor of English at Frostburg State University and president of the Poe Studies Association. \u201cIt\u2019s not Poe. My first clue was that it was ungrammatical,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nWhen asked about the authenticity of the quote, Poe expert J. Gerald Kennedy responded with one word: \u201cfake!\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
