The comments drew harsh criticism prompting podcast hosts Nazanin Mandi and Nadia Moham, of the show \u201cLadies Like Us,\u201d to apologize. Mandi and Moham posted on the social platform Instagram that they regretted their reaction to T.I.\u2019s statements but said that they were caught off guard by them.\n\n\n\n T.I. has remained silent. Our email to his record label with questions about his comments went unanswered, and he has made no statements to the news media or on social media. His daughter, 18-year-old model Deyjah Harris, has also avoided commenting directly on the matter.\n\nDuring the podcast episode in question, T.I. stated, \u201cThis is what we do: Right after the birthday, we celebrate. And usually like the day after the party, she\u2019s enjoying her gifts, I put a sticky note on the door: \u2018Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30,'\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times:\n\nThe Atlanta rapper, who also goes by the nickname Tip, went on to explain that the physician \u2014 \u201cmaintaining a high level of professionalism\u201d \u2014 always tells him that his daughter has to sign away her privacy before results can be shared, and always tells him that a hymen can be broken in many ways that do not involve sex. \u201cI say, \u2018Look, doc, she don\u2019t ride no horses, she don\u2019t ride no bike, she don\u2019t play no sports. Man, just check the hymen please and give me back my results expeditiously,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to \u201cresults\u201d that legally belong to his daughter.\n\nThe comments were quickly and broadly condemned, while gynecologist Jennifer Gunter took the opportunity to write a 12-tweet, mini-lecture that points out the hymen isn\u2019t an indicator of virginity:\n\n\n\n In 2018, three United Nations agencies, the World Health Organization, UN Human Rights, and UN Women called for a ban on such so-called virginity tests, calling them harmful and medically meaningless:\n\nThese examinations are not only a violation of women\u2019s and girls\u2019 human rights, but in cases of rape can cause additional pain and mimic the original act of sexual violence, leading to re-experience, re-traumatization and re-victimization. Many women suffer from adverse short- and long-term physical, psychological and social consequences of this practice. This includes anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. In extreme cases, women or girls may attempt suicide or be killed in the name of \u201chonour\u201d. Performing this medically unnecessary and harmful test violates several human rights and ethical standards including the fundamental principle in medicine to \u2018do no harm\u2019. WHO recommends that this test should not be performed under any circumstances.", "lang": "en"}
