People now get less Housing Benefit if they have bedrooms considered surplus to requirements, unless included on the list of exemptions.\n\nThe Court of Appeal has now said that the change discriminates against two particular groups of people, in breach of human rights law.\n\nThe government had argued that they could be helped by 'Discretionary Housing Payments', but the court felt that not including them on the list of outright exemptions wasn't justified.\n\nThe first group affected is victims of domestic violence whose spare rooms have been adapted as a \u2018panic space\u2019 under the government\u2019s Sanctuary Scheme.\n\nThe Child Poverty Action Group says that 281 households are in the Sanctuary Scheme and affected by the 'bedroom tax'. So the judgment seems to affect only that number of particularly vulnerable families, rather than all domestic violence victims.\n\nThe other case was disabled children needing overnight carers. The court decided that disabled adults and disabled children were treated differently by the changed Housing Benefit regime. This discrimination was \u201cvery difficult to justify\u201d.\n\nAgain, this finding is important to families in this situation, but not necessarily others.\n\nThe case is now going to the Supreme Court. It was already due to hear a similar case on the \u2018bedroom tax\u2019 policy in March, and has now said that it will revisit these newer cases as part of the same decision.\n\nSo the Supreme Court case is going to be very important.\n\nWe added confirmation that the cases are being appealed to the Supreme Court.", "lang": "en"}
