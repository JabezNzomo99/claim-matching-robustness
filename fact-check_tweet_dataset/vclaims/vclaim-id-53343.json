These news stories latched onto a 2007 paper where scientists burned havan s\u00e1magri, a fragrant mix of wood, roots, and herbs burned during certain Hindu rituals, and then grew bacteria that they sampled from the air. The scientists concluded that the smoke is an effective way to remove disease-causing bacteria from a room[1].\n\nThese articles are inaccurate, however, because havan s\u00e1magri does not contain sage and was therefore not tested in the 2007 study. Furthermore, no high-quality studies have tested whether sage smoke has any antibacterial effects. The NIH National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health also reports that \u201csage has not been clearly shown to be helpful for any health condition\u201d when ingested.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s difficult to say whether the herbs in havan s\u00e1magri that the researchers did burn have any effect, because the 2007 study has a design flaw. The researchers burned the medicinal plant materials plus mango wood in a closed room for one hour and filtered the air at several timepoints between one and 24 hours later to sample any airborne bacteria. They reported a rapid decline in bacteria in the air. But instead of repeating the entire experiment without the havan s\u00e1magri as a negative control, they compared the numbers of airborne bacteria to a single control sampling point after one hour of burning mango wood first. As a result, it\u2019s not possible to say whether the 24-hour reduction in microbes is purely due to the havan s\u00e1magri.\n\nSpecific components of smoke from various plants have been shown to limit microbial growth in fungal and bacterial cell cultures[2,3] and in smoked meats[4]. The exact reasons why they work, or whether they would be effective on the air in a living space, are unknown.\n\nEven if further studies show that havan s\u00e1magri smoke can clean bacteria from the air, it likely dirties the air in another way\u2014by releasing soot and other potentially hazardous airborne particles. The health effects caused by soot are widely studied. The U.S Environmental Protection Agency reports that exposure to soot can aggravate asthma, cause breathing problems, and even increase the risk of early death in people with heart and lung problems.\n\nIn summary, there is not enough evidence yet to recommend the burning of sage, havan s\u00e1magri, or any other herbs to disinfect the air. Furthermore, people with pre-existing respiratory and heart problems may be wise to avoid the smoke released by smudging, as it may aggravate those conditions.\n\u2022 2 \u2013 Chun et al.
