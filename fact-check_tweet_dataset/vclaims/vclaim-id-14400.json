It doesn\u2019t bar \u201cMuslims from holding public office,\u201d as social media posts erroneously claim.\n\nWhen the Trump administration announced its controversial travel ban in January 2017, suspending immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries, it cited a provision enshrined in U.S. law six decades earlier.\n\nSpecifically, the executive order cited a section in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act, which gave the president power to \u201csuspend\u201d or \u201cimpose\u2026restrictions\u201d on the entry of all or certain immigrants, if he finds that such entry \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut deceptive, viral posts on Facebook in recent weeks have distorted the law beyond recognition, falsely claiming that it \u201cbans Muslims from holding public office in the United States.\u201d\n\nIn fact, nowhere in the law is there a mention of religious standards for those seeking public office, including Muslims. Such a ban would contravene the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion.\n\nThe 1952 law largely codified the country\u2019s immigration policies. It implemented changes \u2014 officially ending the exclusion of Asian immigrants, for example \u2014 and upheld other aspects such as the national-origins quota system established in 1924.\n\nPresident Harry Truman, saying that the national-origins quota system was \u201cbased upon assumptions at variance with our American ideals,\u201d vetoed the bill \u2014 which Congress was able to override. Those quotas were ultimately repealed a decade later and subsequent immigration legislation also overhauled parts of the law.\n\nWe debunked a story earlier this year that falsely claimed that the Supreme Court had upheld a 1952 law barring Muslims from serving in government. That story, first published on a self-proclaimed satirical website, didn\u2019t mention the McCarran-Walter Act by name.\n\nThe claims about the non-existent restriction circulate as the first two Muslim women prepare to enter Congress.\n\nDemocrats Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib were elected to the House this month to represent districts in Minnesota and Michigan, respectively. They will join Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson, a Democrat from Indiana, who is also Muslim.\n\nOmar will replace Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison, who in 2006 became the first Muslim elected to Congress.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nChishti, Muzaffar, et. al. \u201cFifty Years On, the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act Continues to Reshape the United States.\u201d Migration Policy Institute. 15 Oct 2015.\n\n\u201cExecutive Order Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.\u201d White House. 27 Jan 2017.\n\nGajanan, Mahita. \u201cIlhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib Just Became the First Muslim Women Elected to Congress.\u201d 7 Nov 2018.\n\n\u201cThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (The McCarran-Walter Act).\u201d Office of the Historian, U.S. Department of State.
