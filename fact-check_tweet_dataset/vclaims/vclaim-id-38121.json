The hoax, which has previously spread everywhere from India and Nepal to Ghana, has re-emerged recently in Kenya alongside a claim that three people were arrested over the plot in the city of Kisumu. However, Kenya police told AFP the security alert was \u201cuntrue\u201d. Nepalese and Indian police have previously also warned people that the message was false.\n\nIn Kenya, the claim has circulated via various posts since 2018.\n\nWe\u2019ve archived that post here. The same claim popped up in the Group Kenya Facebook group, which has over two million followers, in 2018.\n\nIn Ghana, the message was shared last year on NDC TV, a Facebook page about the NDC political party, which has more than 200,000 followers.\n\nWe searched for the first few words of the alert \u201cAttention...If someone comes to your doorstep and says we from the medical college\u201d on Facebook and spotted the same text in a post published by the verified account of Nepal Police on September 16, 2018.\n\nThe Nepali-language part of the text says that Nepal Police did not issue the alert, warning that the message is misleading. \u201cThis is to inform you that the message was not issued by Nepal Police,\u201d the last part reads.\n\nIn Kenya, police spokesman Charles Wahong'o confirmed to AFP that the force was not dealing with any such situation, and there had been no such arrests in Kisumu.\n\n\"This is not true, we have not had any incident of this nature reported,\" Wahong\u2019o said.\n\nA search on Google for the first few words of the message located this fact-check on India Today published two years ago in which police in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh dismissed the same claim, which was circulating via Hindi-language WhatsApp messages at the time.\n\nThe hoax has been similarly debunked before here and here.", "lang": "en"}
