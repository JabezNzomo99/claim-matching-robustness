However, there is no public record of such an order, and representatives of both the Rwandan and Chinese governments said this never happened.\n\nAccording to a Facebook post published by a page called \u201cCNN Zambia\u201d, 18 Chinese nationals were \u201csent packing back to China\u201d on May 27, 2020, after President Paul Kagame allegedly discovered that they were mistreating Rwandan workers and grabbing their land.\n\nThe post also includes a long quote attributed to Kagame, which reads, in part: \u201cThis country is for Africans and those who mean well for us. I\u2019m instructing those 18 Chinese nationals to go back and never return back!\u201d\n\nThe transparency section of the Facebook page reveals that it was first created on May 2, 2020, under the name Bally News, then changed to CNN Zambia on May 23, 2020. The page is not verified -- unlike others belonging to the American news channel CNN.\n\nSimilar Facebook posts were shared here and here, while on YouTube the same claim was circulated in videos here and here.\n\nThe claim also appeared on a website called Zambian Observer, which has frequently published misinformation. (See AFP\u2019s previous debunks here, here and here.)\n\nThere are no reports from any reputable media organisations of Kagame making such a statement. A Rwandan government spokesperson told AFP Fact Check the claim was \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nAnd in response to a Zimbabwean politician who tweeted the claim, Kagame's media adviser, Yolande Makolo, warned that the reports were false.\n\nOn June 3, 2020, the foreign affairs ministry also issued a statement on Twitter asking the public to ignore the claims.\n\n\"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation would like to inform the public that there has been fake news circulating on various social media platforms stating that 18 Chinese citizens were expelled from Rwanda; no such thing happened. Please ignore,\" reads the statement.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Rwanda confirmed to AFP Fact Check that claims about the deportation were, indeed, wrong.\n\n\u201cChinese embassy didn't receive any info about this fabricated deportation. Total fake news\u201d, a representative of the Chinese embassy in Rwanda wrote.\n\nReports of Chinese nationals mistreating local workers in Africa are not new. In February, Kenya\u2019s interior minister ordered the deportation of four Chinese nationals who were accused of assaulting a Kenyan restaurant worker. The scene, which was captured on video, caused outrage on social media.", "lang": "en"}
