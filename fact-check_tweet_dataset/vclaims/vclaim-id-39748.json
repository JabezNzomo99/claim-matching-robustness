More so, credible media reports as well as legislation negate the claim. And finally, the numbers appended proved fruitless!\n\nThe Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) is responsible for the management, control and regulation of traffic in Lagos. While noble in its intent, the application of said regulation can be a tad tricky. This is evidenced by cases of extortion and bribery; as well as disciplinary actions being taken against LASTMA officials. Such instances have resulted in retaliatory actions by indigenes involving assault.\n\nInterpretation as to whether the jurisdiction of LASTMA entails arrest has since been debated. Recently though, the LASTMA, CEO \u2013 Chris Olakpe \u2013 cleared the air in this regard citing, the 2012 Lagos Traffic Laws. Nonetheless, claims surrounding these issues still persist.\n\nFirst, Dubawa tried calling this number- 08129928600, but it was not available. The verification app, Truecaller, confirmed it was a LASTMA line. The second line- 08129928550 was a personal line addressed to a Wale Musa. He told us it was a \u201cwrong number\u201d.\n\nNext, we referred to the Lagos State Traffic Laws- 2012.\n\nAdditionally, Section 22- subsection 1 gave the police as well as LASTMA power to arrest a driver on the highway.\n\nThe original post was traced to this Facebook page which was uploaded on June 18, 2019. However, the authenticity of the page is questionable; as it does not possess the mandatory tick required for pages of public interest. More so, the disparity in logos (profile picture) is evident.\n\nAlso, reports by TheCable and PM News further negate the claim. On June 14- 2019, said reports explain how the governor charged LASTMA to arrest anybody that failed to obey traffic laws. In his words:\n\n\u201cIf anyone breaks the law and he says he is a brother to the governor, tell him to call the governor to pay for the offence.\n\n\u201cLagosians expect a corrupt-free LASTMA that will not be collecting bribes. Be respectful and courteous even when you are going to arrest an offender\n\n\u201cLagosians want LASTMA that is decent, they want neatness. We don\u2019t want laziness and lateness to work. Be my advocates.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Babajide Sanwoolu made the claim. More so, credible media reports as well as legislation negate the claim. And finally, the numbers appended, proved fruitless!", "lang": "en"}
