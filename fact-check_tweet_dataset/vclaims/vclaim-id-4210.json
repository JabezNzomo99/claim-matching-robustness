The misleading headline capitalizes on rumors about the couple\u2019s dynamic to trick people into clicking the link.\n\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed.

(Here\u2019s a timeline of Trump\u2019s explanations for the Stormy Daniels payment.)\n\n\"Will Melania resist being seen with Donald publicly as she did after the first time Donald\u2019s affair with Daniels stole headlines?\" said the realtimepolitics.com post. \"What is your reaction?\"\n\nRealtimepolitics.com\u2019s headline is false, pure click-bait and completely misleading.
