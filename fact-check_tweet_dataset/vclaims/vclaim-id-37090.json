Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post\n\nClaim: American government has printed the image of Ambedkar on their country\u2019s USD 100 note. Fact: The USD 100 note carries the image of Benjamin Franklin. The American government has never printed any other person\u2019s image on its USD 100 currency note. Hence, the claim stands FALSE.\n\nWhen googled about the details of various currency notes published in America, the Currency Education Program\u2019s website uscurrency.gov was found in the search results. As per the information on the website, the design of the American dollar has changed 4 times but all of them carried the image of Benjamin Franklin. So, the American government has never printed Ambedkar\u2019s image on their country\u2019s currency note.\n\nThere are few websites which allow us to replace the image on USD 100 note with an image of our choice. You can notice that one such 100$ note with Obama picture on it has the same code as the one shared in the post.\n\nHence, the photo carrying the image of Ambedkar on USD 100 note is an edited one.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
