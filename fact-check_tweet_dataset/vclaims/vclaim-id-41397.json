However, the accused, who were arrested by the Jaunpur (Uttar Pradesh) police, are not Muslims.\n\nA caption with the viral post reads \"Pure Horror. At least 2 Peacefuls Beating a Girl, they trying to torn her Cloth, and this might ended into Gang Rape Location - Unknown Help to trace these B*stards Please don't feel shame to RT.\" While the caption does not directly mentions the accused as Muslims, it uses the term 'peaceful' which is widely used nowadays to refer to people from the community in a derisive way.\n\nDue to the graphic nature of the video, BOOM has decided not to share the video.\n\nThe 45-second long video shows a youngster trying to forcefully undress a girl. Another youth can be seen filming the heinous act.\n\nOne of the replies on the tweet mentions that the incident is from Jaunpur and the duo had been arrested.

The duo has been arrested. The minor girl had gone to herd sheep in the area when the accused came on a motorcycle and harassed her -- VK Mishra, SP, Jaunpur\n\nThe names of the accused mentioned by the SP clearly indicate that they don't belong to the minority community.\n\nThe incident had also been reported widely earlier this month by several newspapers.
