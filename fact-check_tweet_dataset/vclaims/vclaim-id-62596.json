It is being claimed that the video in question is from Hyderabad.\n\nThe caption of the video read: \u201cSocial distance norms gone to digs for these pissfuls in old city hyderabad. Madina shopping centre scene. KCR taken dhrutarastra avatar. Home minister is Mehmood Ali taken avatar of Ghandari.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: People are NOT being punished for feeding migrant labourers; here\u2019s the\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to it is FALSE.\n\nWe extracted keyframes of the video and put them through Reverse Image Search which led us to the same video posted by a verified Twitter handle @UsamaQureshy- who is Director, Oasis Energy and Vice Chairman Pak-UK Business Council, on May 19, 2020. The caption suggested that the video is from a market in Pakistan\u2019s Faisalabad.\n\nTaking a cue, we ran another search with keywords such as \u2018market\u2019, \u2018Coronavirus\u2019, \u2018Faisalabad\u2019, \u2018Pakistan\u2019 \u2018social distancing\u2019 etc. In the results, we found the same video posted by several Pakistani users suggesting that it is from New Anarkali market in Faisalabad, Pakistan.\n\nOn observing the video frame-by-frame, we noticed a small banner with a text in Urdu. On translation, we found that the text in Urdu read: \u2018Aini Shoes\u2019.\n\nWe ran another search and it revealed the address of Aini Shoes in New Anarkali market in Faisalabad, Pakistan.\n\nIn conclusion, the above information proves that the video in question is NOT from India but from Pakistan. However, NewsMobile cannot independently verify the timeline of the video.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
