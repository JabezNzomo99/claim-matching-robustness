Here\u2019s a newspaper clipping from the Edmonton Journal about Princess Elizabeth\u2019s service:\n\nThe viral photograph was taken by William Horton and is available via the National Portrait Gallery of London. A number of additional images of Princess Elizabeth training as a mechanic during World War II can also be found at Getty Images.\n\n\n\n \n\n The International Museum of World War II displayed a similar photograph of Princess Elizabeth at their \u201cWomen in WWII: On the Home Fronts and the Battlefronts\u201d exhibition in 2018. Kenneth Rendell, the museum\u2019s director, told Time magazine at the time:\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s a really interesting example of women\u2019s roles in the war. Women wanted to be part of what was going on. They were a part of what was going on. It fits in with the statement made by Elizabeth\u2019s mother, Queen Elizabeth, that when Buckingham Palace was bombed she felt she could look the East Enders in the eye.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
