Khandelwal had commented on the photo mentioning that the woman in the viral photo is not Varthaman's wife but one of her friends.\n\nBOOM got in touch with the user and the story will be updated once we get a reply.\n\nA further search led us to the profile of Jahnavi Das, whose photos on a social media site matched to that of the woman in the viral image.\n\nBOOM contacted Das, who confirmed that it was her photo that had gone viral. Das said, \u201cIt is a fake post, kindly get it deleted from everywhere.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the photograph was ever posted on Facebook, Das replied via message that she had never shared the photograph online. \n\n\n\nMultiple reports have also mentioned that Varthaman's wife is Tanvi Marwaha, ex IAF Squadron Leader. She was in fact present in Delhi, when Minister of Defence Nirmala Sitharaman visited Varthaman after his release.\n\nA look at these photos further shows that the woman in the viral photo is not Varthaman's wife.\n\nAfter being held captive for two days after his fighter jet was shot down, Varthaman was released by Pakisan authorities \u201cgesture of peace\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
