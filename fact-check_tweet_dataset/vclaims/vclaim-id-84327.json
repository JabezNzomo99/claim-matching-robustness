Photographer Tom Kiefer told AFP he took the image in July 2015 after having worked as a janitor at a CBP processing facility in Arizona until 2014. Current CBP policy states migrants\u2019 personal property should be returned to them after they leave a CBP facility. But representatives from an NGO working at the US southern border told AFP that detained migrants continue to report some personal items confiscated by the authorities have never been returned to them.\n\nThe rosary image was shared in this Facebook post on June 21, 2019.\n\nThe post features an image of wedding rings next to an image of rosaries. Beneath the images, the text states: \u201cWedding rings taken from Holocaust victims. Rosaries taken from immigrants at the US border. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe same image was also shared in this Twitter post on June 23, 2019, suggesting it was a recent picture related to current US policy.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the photo of the rosaries published in this article by The New Yorker magazine on March 12, 2017.\n\nThe headline states: \u201cA Janitor Preserves the Seized Belongings of Migrants.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo in the article:\n\nPhotographer Tom Kiefer told AFP in an email on July 2, 2019 he took the image in July 2015 after having worked as a janitor at a CBP processing facility in Arizona until 2014. He said the image showed rosaries confiscated prior to 2014.\n\nThis was years prior to President Donald Trump declaring a national emergency on the US southern border.\n\nKiefer told AFP he retrieved the rosaries from the trash at the CBP processing facility in Why, Arizona. \u201cI came upon these as I was removing the cans of food in the trash the migrants and asylum seekers carried in their backpack. I asked and was given permission to collect the food and bring it to our local food bank,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he left his job with CBP in 2014 to work full time on photographing the items he had collected. \u201cWhen you take away, separate, remove such a deeply personal and religious item from someone and it ends up in the trash, that is disturbing.\u201d\n\nKiefer discusses items he retrieved in this YouTube video published on June 28, 2018 for an exhibition at the Saugatuck Center for the Arts in Michigan.\n\nOn his official website, Kiefer named his collection of images of discarded personal effects \u201cEl Sue\u00f1o Americano\u201d which translates to English as \u201cThe American Dream.\u201d\n\nThe photo of rosaries continued to be shared thousands of times here on Twitter in June 2018 amid increased media attention on the caravans of Central American migrants walking to the US border.\n\nHere is an article published by online magazine Insider on June 27, 2018 in which Kiefer\u2019s photos were featured again.\n\nThat article was retweeted thousands of times on Twitter here in June 2019.\n\nKiefer has since removed the image of the rosaries featured in the posts from his website and social media accounts. He told AFP, \u201cI reshot the exact rosaries in a different configuration.\u201d\n\nThat image is available on his website and on his Instagram account here, here and here.\n\nWhat is CBP policy on personal property?\n\nIn October 2015, then-CBP Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske issued this document entitled \u201cNational Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search\u201d (TEDS).\n\nCBP confirmed that this policy is still the overarching policy for the detention of migrants.\n\nThe policy states: \u201cAll detainees\u2019 personal property discovered during apprehension or processing and not deemed to be contraband will be safeguarded, itemized according to the operational office\u2019s policies and procedures, and documented in the appropriate electronic system(s) of record.\u201d\n\nPoint 7.4 states: \u201cAt the discretion of officers/agents, a detainee may keep some personal items in their possession, as long as a particular item does not pose a threat to the security or good order of the facility.\u201d\n\nA CBP official told AFP by email on July 11, 2019: \u201cItems that have a cord/rope/string could pose significant officer and detainee safety hazard (choking, suicide and strangulation) and should be secured in the individual\u2019s property. We also remove shoelaces and belts from the individuals in our custody and store it with their property because they pose similar risks.\u201d\n\nThe same official said that personal property is stored in numbered bags and that migrants can reclaim the property when they leave a CBP facility.\n\nBut David Hill, a volunteer for Arizona based non-profit group No More Deaths, which has run its Property Recovery Assistance Project for migrants since 2008, told AFP in a July 3, 2019 email: \u201cAmong deportees, it is extremely common for them to report that they didn't get their stuff back.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hill, who volunteers in Nogales, Arizona, retrieving personal property for deportees: \u201cWe fully inventory each bag of property we receive. As far as rosaries go, they're common enough. So are things like scapulars and prayer cards, and all kinds of religious and nonreligious personal items. I searched my database of inventories and got 183 hits for \u2018rosary.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe non-partisan American Immigration Council also published this report on December 21, 2016 about the mishandling of migrants\u2019 belongings.\n\nThe report states that after the introduction of CBP\u2019s TEDS policy in 2015, there was little change in the percentage of migrants who reported that not all their possessions had been returned after their release.\n\nThe report states in part: \u201cSpecifically, before TEDS went into effect in October 2015, 41.5 percent of respondents whose belongings had been retained upon detention reported that not all of their belongings were returned. After TEDS, this proportion was almost identical at 41 percent.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
