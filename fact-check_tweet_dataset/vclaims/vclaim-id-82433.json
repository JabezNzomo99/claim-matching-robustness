Multiple Facebook users shared a video of protesters on a city street, claiming it shows a scene from the \u201cUnite for Freedom\u201d rally in London that day.\n\n\u201cAnti-Lockdown rally in London today!\u201d reads the caption. \u201cThe \u2018Wear a Mask and Social distance\u2019 crowd won\u2019t enjoy THIS VIDEO!\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show UK Government Letter About Proposed Mandatory Microchips)\n\nIn truth, the depicted protest occurred in Minsk, Belarus, in response to President Alexander Lukashenko claiming a sixth term in office. The front of Minsk\u2019s Central Post Office is visible in the footage, and many protesters can be seen carrying historical red-and-white Belarusian flags. Photos of the flag-bearing protesters in Minsk appeared in reports from CNBC and the Los Angeles Times, among other outlets.\n\nPaul Ronzheimer, a journalist with the German outlet Bild, tweeted the video on Aug. 23. He told Check Your Fact in an Instagram direct message that he filmed it from Hotel Minsk near the city\u2019s Independence Square.\n\n\u201cPolice: \u2018Dear citizens, this is an unauthorized mass meeting\u2026\u2019 But people don\u2019t care, even the street which leads to the square is PACKED,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nProtests have taken place in Belarus since its Aug. 9 presidential election, according to BBC News. The country\u2019s Central Election Commission announced that Lukashenko received about 80 percent of the vote, though opposition supporters have accused him of vote-rigging, CNN reported.\n\nIn an Aug. 10 statement, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the conduct of Belarus\u2019 election was \u201cnot free and fair.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
