The Shadow Health Secretary's \u00a3822 million figure was based on the most up to date information that was then available, though it only refers to the provider side of the NHS. The bodies that commission services for them ended the year with a surplus of some \u00a3150 million.\n\nThe trusts would have had a bigger deficit, had NHS England and the Department of Health (DH) not put in some \u00a3350 million in funding over the course of the year. DH says the \"underlying\" deficit for providers was \u00a31.2 billion.\n\nForecasts, as ever, are a bit trickier to check. NHS Providers, a charity which represents most NHS trusts, has told us feedback from its members is behind its estimate of a \u00a32.1 billion deficit this year. Government body Monitor has already said this year's deficit \"threatens\" to reach \u00a31 billion for the trusts it oversees, which make up about three fifths of trusts in total.\n\nThe government has said the growth in deficits is due to \"appalling mismanagement\" under the last Labour government. It says substandard care at Mid Staffs has meant hospitals are trying to sharply increase the number of nurses on their wards, raising the bill for agency staff, and that PFI debts arranged under Labour are making the situation more difficult. Labour says nursing shortages are due to cuts to by the Coalition at the start of the last Parliament.\n\nWe've looked at the cost of NHS staffing shortages before. We'll be looking at PFI and its effects on NHS finances soon.\n\nThere was a deficit of \u00a3830 million last year across all trusts\n\nThere are two types of trusts: NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts. NHS trusts can become foundation trusts if they pass a number of tests, one of which is to do with how well their finances are managed. This gives them greater freedom from the Department of Health.\n\nSo in theory, foundation trusts should be in a better financial position than other NHS trusts, on average.\n\nOverall, foundation trusts were \u00a3345 million in the red last year (2014/15), with 77 out of 153 of them losing money. That's according to Monitor, their regulator.\n\nOther NHS trusts had an overall deficit of \u00a3485 million, with 43 out of 99 of them losing money, according to the Trust Development Authority, which oversees them.\n\nSo that makes a financial deficit of \u00a3830 million across all trusts. DH accounts at around the same time put it slightly higher at \u00a3842 million.\n\nThe situation would have been worse for trusts had it not been for one-off support from NHS England and the DH, which the government says totalled \u00a3350 million. It puts last year's \"underlying deficit\" for the provider sector at \u00a31.2 billion.\n\nAs things stand, next year is likely to be even more difficult\n\nWithout action to bring costs down, foundation trusts alone face a \u00a31 billion deficit in 2015/16, according to Monitor.\n\nNHS Providers, the charity that represents NHS trusts and foundation trusts, estimates the total deficit will rise to between \u00a32 billion and \u00a32.5 billion. It told us this is based on feedback from its members.\n\nJournalists at the Health Service Journal (\u00a3) have looked at May and June board papers for 142 'acute trusts'. These are trusts that run hospitals as opposed to mental health, community, or ambulance services, and they include both NHS trusts and foundation trusts. It found that together these trusts expect to have a \u00a32.1 billion deficit for the year.\n\nThat doesn't mean that NHS providers as a whole would have that kind of deficit\u2014acute trusts were more likely to be in deficit last year than other trusts were.\n\nAll three of the above figures are based on forecasts from trusts, which in practice are often off the mark. In the middle of last year, foundation trusts were predicted to end the year with a \u00a3271 million deficit rather than the \u00a3345 million shortfall that actually came to pass.\n\nSo going on past form we might expect the deficit for this year to be higher than those forecasts suggest.\n\nThen again, trusts are now being told they must revisit their plans and cut deficits\u2014Monitor has said it will \"clamp down\" on poor financial performance. If its successful then the overall deficits will be lower than forecast.\n\nSenior staff at NHS providers seem to be pessimistic about the financial situation. When think tank the Kings Fund asked a panel of NHS 50 finance directors, two thirds said they expected their own trust to be in deficit in 2015/16.\n\nThe Nuffield Trust, another think tank, spoke to a panel of 78 'health leaders', including managers and clinicians. Of these, four fifths had concerns about the financial viability of their local provider and seven in ten thought providers would need to go into deficit on the basis of their current level of funding.\n\nThis article originally used the term \"NHS deficit\" to refer to the NHS provider deficit. Following feedback we've corrected it to make clear that when finances for commissioners are included, the deficit is smaller.\n\nWe've also updated to include the DH's estimate of the underlying deficit, alongside the eventual deficit experienced by providers.", "lang": "en"}
