(We have seen it in what feels like a gadzillion ads.) Let\u2019s look at the other elements of this ad.\n\nEvery Democrat in the Senate, including Hagen, voted for that bill. But it was never officially reconciled with a House version because the Democrats lost the Massachusetts Senate seat in a special election. So an amendment of the Senate bill, crafted in the House, was finally passed on March 25 under a procedure that avoided the 60-vote requirement. That bill only needed 50 votes, and it passed 56 to 43, with Hagan voting with the majority.\n\nThis number seems high because generally states have reported how many policies were canceled, not how many people were affected. In the case of North Carolina, the number of policies was 183,821\u2014before the Obama administration announced rules that would allow people to keep their policies for at least another year in many states.\n\nRepublicans used to love to compare the number of cancellations with the number of sign-ups; we have explained repeatedly that the cancellations and the sign-ups are hard to compare as they are really apples and oranges. But it\u2019s especially absurd to bring this up now that the law has met its enrollment targets.\n\nAs it turns out, significantly more policies were purchased in North Carolina on the Obamacare exchange\u2014357,584 policies, according to the Web site ACAsignups.net. That\u2019s nearly double the number of \u201ccancellations,\u201d even though North Carolina was a state that chose not to accept the provision of expanded Medicaid in the law.\n\nNow this is really old! This claim was repeatedly made during the 2012 presidential campaign by the Mitt Romney campaign, so one wonders why it would still be considered effective now. (The ad then further cites a University of Minnesota study that says $16.5 billion would be taken from Medicare in North Carolina.)\n\nThe $700 billion figure comes from the difference over 10 years (2013-2022) between anticipated Medicare spending (what is known as \u201cthe baseline\u201d) and the changes that the law makes to reduce spending. The savings mostly are wrung from health-care providers, not Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 who, as a result of the health-care law, ended up with new benefits for preventive care and prescription drugs. (It is worth noting that, given past practices, the Medicare actuary has doubted whether all of the planned cuts actually will come to pass.)\n\nWhile it is correct that anticipated savings from Medicare were used to help offset some of the anticipated costs of expanding health care for all Americans, it does not affect the Medicare trust fund. In fact, the Obama health-care law also raised Medicare payroll taxes by $318 billion over the new 10-year time frame, further strengthening the program\u2019s financial condition.\n\nUnder the health-care law, spending does not decrease in Medicare year after year; the reduction is from anticipated levels of spending in future years. Moreover, the \u201ccuts\u201d did not come at the expense of seniors, even though the ad suggests that by having the voiceover refer to cuts to \u201cour Medicare.\u201d (Crossroads GPS spokesman Paul Lindsay responded: \u201cIf it\u2019s not cutting \u2018our\u2019 Medicare then whose is it cutting?\u201d)\n\nMoreover, it worth noting the House Republican budget plan retains virtually all of the Medicare \u201ccuts\u201d contained in the health-care law, but diverts them instead to their Medicare overhaul. Not to be a cynic, but one could presume that had it been a Republican plan that had passed, the Democrats would be running ads about the \u201ccuts.\u201d\n\nMinutes after Clinton finished, a fuming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) held his own news conference in Seattle and pronounced himself \u201cvery, very disappointed\u201d in Clinton\u2019s remarks. He accused the president of making \u201cmisleading claims, misleading information and misleading offers\u201d and said Clinton was playing \u201ca political game\u201d that makes negotiating harder. Adopting a professorial air, Gingrich stood in front of an easel and scribbled figures to underscore his contention that the Republican budget increases Medicare and Medicaid spending over the next seven years. For instance, he said, Medicare spending would go from $926 billion to $1.684 trillion. \u201cIn any reasonable forum, this is not a cut,\u201d Gingrich said.", "lang": "en"}
