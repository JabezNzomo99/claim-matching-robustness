North, the incoming president of the National Rifle Association, said in a television appearance on Sunday that young people are \u201csteeped in a culture of violence.\u201d\n\nJust two days after a school shooting in Santa Fe, Tex., left 10 dead, the incoming president of the National Rifle Association appeared on television on Sunday to blame mass shootings on a \u201cculture of violence\u201d and the drug Ritalin, adding that \u201ctaking away the rights of law-abiding citizens\u201d would not stop the carnage. \u201cThe problem that we\u2019ve got is we\u2019re trying like the dickens to treat the symptom without treating the disease,\u201d the next president, Oliver L. North, said on the program \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cAnd the disease in this case isn\u2019t the Second Amendment. The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence.\u201d The N.R.A., the country\u2019s most vocal and active proponent of gun rights, has in the past kept a low profile in the wake of mass shootings. After the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and six staff members dead, for instance, the organization shut down its Facebook page, stopped updating its Twitter feed and did not return calls from the news media.\n\n\u201cThe shameful politicization of tragedy \u2014 it\u2019s a classic strategy, right out of the playbook of a poisonous movement,\u201d he told the crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. \u201cThe N.R.A. will not only speak out,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will speak out louder and we will speak out stronger than ever before.\u201d Erik Bernstein, vice president of Bernstein Crisis Management, said on Monday that Mr. North\u2019s appearance on television was a sign of the \u201cnew strategy.\u201d He said the N.R.A. is likely facing growing pressure from donors, politicians and gun manufacturers to respond more quickly.\n\n\u201cThe tone around gun violence is really not in their favor right now,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit silent and do \u2018no comment.\u2019 That just doesn\u2019t work while people are dying.\u201d Mike Kuczkowski, the chief executive of Orangefiery, a communications strategy company, said on Monday that the N.R.A. \u201chas been very adept in knowing when they didn\u2019t need to intervene.\u201d But in the wake of the Parkland shooting, there has been a rise in high-profile student activists who have been able to influence the debate about guns, Mr. Kuczkowski said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a remarkable thing for us to see who have been following this conversation over the decades,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I were in the N.R.A.\u2019s shoes, I would take that seriously. I would want to rally the base.\u201d On Sunday, Mr. North said television and movies helped promote violence but also blamed medication. \u201cIf you look at what has happened to the young people, many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten,\u201d he said. Ritalin and other stimulants used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are not known to produce violent behavior, experts said. \u201cThe odds that a medication like this is going to be associated with an act that took weeks or months to prepare is slim to none,\u201d said Dr. Steven P. Cuffe, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville.\n\nA.D.H.D. medications like methylphenidate, which is the generic name of Ritalin, and amphetamine preparations, like Adderall, can produce anger or irritability in some patients. But when that happens, the drug is discontinued and the patient is prescribed a different medication, said Dr. Cuffe, who has studied A.D.H.D. for two decades. Drugs like methylphenidate have a short half-life, meaning they don\u2019t accumulate in a patient\u2019s body. For that reason, patients experiencing an idiosyncratic reaction would have an impulsive outburst, responding to something happening \u201cin the moment,\u201d Dr. Cuffe said, \u201cnot something that was planned out over time.\u201d Dr. R. Scott Benson, a child and adolescent psychiatrist in Pensacola, Fla., who has been practicing psychiatry for 40 years, said that about 5 to 7 percent of grade school children are estimated to have A.D.H.D., and hundreds of thousands of children are taking A.D.H.D. medications. There is no statistical correlation between these drugs and mass violence, he added. \u201cAmerica is unique in that it creates shooters, and what we need to look at is what\u2019s unique about America,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one thing that\u2019s unique about America is that we have guns everywhere.\u201d Shannon Watts, founder of the nonprofit Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a grass-roots movement born after the Newtown shooting, shared a similar sentiment. \u201c.@NRA President blames America\u2019s school shooting crisis on media violence and Ritalin. This is false,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cAmerican teens watch the same movies and play the same video games as their peers in other high income countries. What\u2019s different? They have easy access to arsenals and ammo.\u201d David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland shooting who has risen to prominence as an outspoken supporter of gun control, also criticized Mr. North on Twitter.", "lang": "en"}
