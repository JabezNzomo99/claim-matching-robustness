And Andy Borowitz provides a good one with his convergence of two big controversies -- President Trump's attacks on NFL players who don't stand for the U.S. national anthem and accusations that Trump is beholden to Russia. The satire piece is spreading fast over social media, but make sure you understand it is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on July 22, 2018 titled \"Trump Demands That N.F.L.
