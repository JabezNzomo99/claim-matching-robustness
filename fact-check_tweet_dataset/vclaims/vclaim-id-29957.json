Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Shaheen Bagh paid-protestors fighting with each other over sharing of money. Fact: At Shaheen Bagh, women are protesting against CAA since 15th December 2019. But, the video in the post is found to exist on the internet at least since January 2019. So, the video is at least a year-old and has no connection with the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFrom the article of \u2018Indian Express\u2019, it can be found that women are holding a sit-in protest at Shaheen Bagh since 15th December 2019 against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).\n\nOn subjecting the screenshots of the video to Google reverse image search technique, the same video was obtained in the search results. The video has the timestamp \u2013 \u2018January 12, 2019\u2019 and the title as \u2018\u0932\u0916\u0928\u090a \u0915\u0947 \u091a\u094c\u0915 \u092c\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u092a\u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0917\u093e\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u091f\u0915\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0939\u093e\u0925\u093e\u092a\u093e\u0908\u2019. No additional information was found regarding the video. But, as the video is on the internet at least since January 2019, it can be ascertained that the video is in no way related to the ongoing Shaheen Bagh protests.\n\nTo conclude, an old video falsely shared as \u2018Shaheen Bagh paid protestors fought among each other over money\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
