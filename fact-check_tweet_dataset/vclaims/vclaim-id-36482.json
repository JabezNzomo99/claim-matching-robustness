The next day, he pronounced the testing system inadequate, and assailed the public-health bureaucracy, Barack Obama and Joe Biden for not fixing it before he became the president.\n\nBut nothing changed in that system over those two days \u2014 Thursday and Friday \u2014 except Trump's stated opinion of it.\n\nTrump has been saying inaccurately for days that the public health system was up and ready to give access to diagnostic tests for COVID-19 for everyone who needed them. He said a week ago the \u201cbeautiful\" tests were there for all in need.\n\nThat's not true.
