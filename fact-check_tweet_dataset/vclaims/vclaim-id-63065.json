The video is viral with a false claim that the protestors are the residents of Surat, Gujarat who are protesting due to the unavailability of food due to lockdown. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is misleading. The video is actually from Kathua, Jammu and Kashmir. Surat also witnessed a protest of workers a couple of days back but the viral video is not related to Surat.\n\nA video is getting viral on Facebook claiming that the protestors in the video are from Surat, Gujarat. The post reads in Hindi: (English translation) \n\n\u201cIn Surat, Gujarat, people have come out on the streets saying either give us food or shoot us.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nDuring our investigation, we noticed a board named \u2018CHENAB Textiles\u2019.\n\nWe searched the appropriate keyword on Google and found many news reports reporting an incident of protests in Kathua where workers of CHENAB TEXTILES have protested due to some salary issues. We found a report dated May 8, 2020 on Outlook in which it was reported that the\n\nprotests happened in Kathua where workers of CHENAB TEXTILES have protested due to some salary issues. We found the same video as well in the report. This was clear that the viral video is not of Surat but of Kathua.\n\nWe also found the video on Youtube Channel of India Today. We could related that same incident was captured but the video was shot from a different angle.\n\nWe also found a video on the Youtube channel of NMF News. We saw the same jeep and CHENAB Textiles board in the video as shown in the viral post. This shows that the viral video is from Kathua and not from Surat, as claimed.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Kathua\u2019s SSP Mr. Shailendra Kumar Mishra. He said: \u201cThe viral video is not from Surat. The incident actually happened in Kathua. The workers of CHENAB textiles protested because they were paid 15 days wages instead of 1 month.\u201d\n\nWe scanned the Facebook page who shared the viral video. The page is followed by more than 4000 people. The page has been created on January 26, 2020.\n\nConclusion: The post claiming that the protests shown in the video happened in Surat is misleading. This incident actually happened in Kathua.", "lang": "en"}
