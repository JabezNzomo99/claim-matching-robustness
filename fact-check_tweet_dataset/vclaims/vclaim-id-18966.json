More than 5700 people were evacuated from Vadodara and its adjoining areas. Water levels increased in Vishwamitri river, which resulted in crocodiles entering the flooded streets of Vadodara.\n\nBOOM was able to find the same clip online, uploaded in March 2018, through a reverse image search.\n\n\"Mating season in the Everglades looks terrifying!,\" the description with the video stated.\n\n\n\nThe Everglades is a tropical wetland region in Florida. The area is famous for providing natural habitat to numerous endangered species like the American crocodiles, manatee, a herbivorous sea mammal and the Florida panther.\n\nThe YouTube video credited a Facebook page 'Florida Made Palm Beach' which had uploaded the longer version of the clip on their Facebook page last year.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than 1 lakh times at the time of writing this article.\n\nBOOM has reached out to the Facebook page and is awaiting a response. \n\n\n\nThough we cannot ascertain where exactly the video was taken our fact-check shows that it is not the Vishwamitri river in Gujarat.", "lang": "en"}
