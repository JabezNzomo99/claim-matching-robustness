Vishvas News in its investigation found the claim to be false.\n\nThe Marathi post shared on Facebook says, \u201cThis is a rare udumbar or umbar (cluster fig) flower of Swami Samartha Maharaj. Seek blessings from the same and zoom to view. This flower is never visible to anyone. This is \u2018Omkar flower\u2019 which blooms once in fifty years. This is the glory of nature. \n\n (Forward this so that people can see this too.)\u201d\n\n The post is shared by user \u201cKishori Malawadkar Upare As\u201d on Facebook.\n\nCheck the post and the archive link.\n\nInvestigation:\n\nVishvas News started with the reverse image search of the picture which is being shared on the Facebook. We first separated the image from the text and then applied the Google reverse image search.\n\nThe reverse image search gives the Possible Related Search as \u201cwood\u201d\n\nThe second page of the search results gives a link and the complete picture of the \u201cflower\u201d.\n\nThe link mentions something in Malyalam, which says, \u201c\u0d36\u0d3f\u0d35\u0d32\u0d3f\u0d02\u0d17\u0d2a\u0d41\u0d37\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d02. \n\n 99 \u0d35\u0d7c\u0d37\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d7d \u0d12\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d7d \u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d02 \u0d2a\u0d42\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d41\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28 \u0d2a\u0d41\u0d37\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d02. (\u0d39\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d32\u0d2f\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d7d) #\ud83d\udc8c \u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d23\u0d2f\u0d02\u201d \n\n Google translate on the content tells us: Shivalinga flower.\n\n Flower only once in 99 years. (In the Himalayas) # \ud83d\udc8c Love\n\nThis made sure that the image was viral in various languages.\n\nWe then downloaded the complete image from the same link and did a reverse image search, Google image search gave us the same results as before and hence, we used the \u2018Bing reverse image search\u2019\n\nThe reverse image search from Bing lead us to the link from New Indian Express\n\nThe news mentioned:\n\nFossil tree from the time of dinosaurs \n\nGymnosperms, are one of the oldest groups of plants, have successfully evolved to sustain themselves on Earth even after 200 million plus years. Therefore, they are fondly known as Living Fossils!\n\nThe similar images were also found on Wikipedia page of Cycas.\n\nThis confirmed that this picture is neither that of cluster fig or Shivalinga flower. \n\nVishvas News then interacted with Pranay Tijare, Vice President of Arranya Environmental Organisation, who confirmed that the picture going viral was not that of \u2018Omkar flower\u2019 which blooms once in fifty years or Audumbar or Cluster fig. The plant belonged to the family of cycas.\n\nThe Facebook User who shared the picture created FB profile in September 2017, belongs to Mohol Maharashtra and is from Pune.\n\nConclusion: The viral picture is neither that of rare udumbar or cluster fig tree and nor of shivlinga flower. The viral picture is that of cycas plant. Viral claims are false.", "lang": "en"}
