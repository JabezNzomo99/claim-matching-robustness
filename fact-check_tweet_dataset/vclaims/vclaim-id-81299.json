And it\u2019s a new open-ended entitlement that basically says to just about everybody in this country, people making less than $100,000, \u2018You know what? If your health care expenses exceed anywhere from 2 to 9.8 percent of your adjusted gross income, don\u2019t worry about it. Taxpayers got you covered. Government\u2019s gonna subsidize the rest.\u2019 From our perspective, these state-based exchanges [in the U.S. Senate\u2019s version] are very little in difference between the House version\u2014which has a big federal exchange, just putting the same rules in place. But what we\u2019re basically saying to people making less than 400 FPL [400% of the Federal Poverty Level], or in real language that\u2019s about $100,000, is \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it. Taxpayers got you covered.\u2019\n\nMr. Ryan maintains that Obamacare, as written, grants subsidies only to people who sign up for coverage on a state exchange. None of the quotes contradict that position. In the first and third quotes, Mr. Ryan is not talking about who will qualify for the subsidies but who will pay for them. Obamacare raids Medicare to pay for a new, open-ended entitlement. Mr. Ryan is making the point that whatever Obamacare\u2019s costs\u2014and whoever incurs them\u2014taxpayers will foot the bill. In the second quote, Mr. Ryan is not talking about who will qualify for the subsidies, but how the exchanges will work. In 2011, states were debating whether to set up their own exchanges, and those in favor argued that doing so would maintain state control over insurance markets. But because the insurance reforms in Obamacare are federal mandates, states have already lost substantial control over their insurance markets, whether they set up an exchange or not. Mr. Ryan was making the point that there\u2019s no difference between state and federal exchanges when it comes to regulating insurance deemed compliant. Mr. Ryan has always maintained that Obamacare is fundamentally flawed\u2014right down to the plain language of the law. That\u2019s exactly what the Supreme Court will rule on this summer.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office originally estimated that only some seven percent of employees would lose their employer-provided coverage as the health-insurance exchanges were implemented in 2010. McKinsey, the business consulting group, has estimated that at minimum somewhere in the order of 30 percent of employees would lose their employer-provided coverage and it could well be as high as 50 percent to 60 percent. Indeed, I think it\u2019s easy to see why that\u2019s true because the financial incentives for an employer would create a reason for them to drop their employee coverage and to then require those individual employees to seek their coverage in health insurance exchanges. And of course the employer-provided coverage is subsidized as a fringe benefit by the employer, not by the American taxpayer. But once they go into the exchanges, they will be eligible \u2014 those individuals will be eligible for taxpayer provided subsidies in the exchanges. Can you tell us how the President\u2019s budget deals with this issue and how we\u2019re going to be able to afford to provide taxpayer-provided subsidies for this 50 or 60 percent of employees that are now provided with employer coverage?\n\nREP. JENKINS: The Affordable Health Care Act makes clear that health insurance subsidies are only available to individuals and families enrolled in an American health benefit exchange, which is defined in the law as a state-based exchange. And further, the law requires that in order to be eligible for exchange subsidies, the individual must be enrolled \u201cthrough an exchange established by the state,\u201d that\u2019s a quote. And in response to Mr. Levin\u2019s question, you explained that it\u2019s clear that many states will not set up exchanges. And as you know, the law does not allow subsidies to flow through federal exchanges. However, back in August, the IRS issued a proposed rule allowing premium subsidies to be made available in all exchanges, whether state or federally run. The IRS commissioner responded to a congressional letter on this matter stating, and I quote, \u201cThe statute includes language that indicates that individuals are eligible for tax credits, whether they are enrolled to state-based exchange or a federally facilitated exchange.\u201d Now, I can\u2019t find the term \u201cfederally facilitated exchange\u201d in the health care law, so I\u2019m just wondering exactly where in the law is the term \u201cfederally facilitated exchange,\u201d or what specific language authorizes the administration to allocate subsidies via the federal exchange. SEC. SEBELIUS: Congresswoman, I\u2019d be glad to get you that answer in writing. There\u2019s some very detailed legal analysis and also a variety of statutory language. So I\u2019ll be sending that back right away. REP. JENKINS: OK. Because it appears \u2014 and I\u2019d just be curious if you would agree \u2014 that essentially the IRS is amending the health care law through the regulatory process. SEC. SEBELIUS: Oh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s accurate at all. But I will send you the statutory references and the legal interpretation. REP. JENKINS: OK. Because if the law provides it\u2019s only federal, it\u2019s only allowed for the state-run exchanges \u2014 SEC. SEBELIUS: I will be happy to answer this question in detail. It has been analyzed and looked at. You may disagree with the analysis, but I will be delighted to get you the language in the statute and the legal interpretation of that language. REP. JENKINS: OK. Because those of us in Congress, I think, get a little defensive when our constitutional authority to write tax policy is taken away from us and imposed through a regulatory agency.\n\nMy op-ed is about the constitutionality\u2014or rather, the unconstitutionality\u2014of Obamacare, whereas King is about the meaning of a specific provision of Obamacare. The op-ed addresses broad constitutional concerns; King involves a narrow, albeit highly important, question of statutory interpretation. These are different issues that raise different questions. Obamacare subsidies don\u2019t go to state governments. They go to individuals, in the form of tax credits. The reason most states ultimately chose not to establish exchanges was because the President decided\u2014after the Affordable Care Act became law\u2014that he was going to provide subsidies on federal exchanges, too, thus eliminating the incentive for states to create their own exchanges. Obamacare coerces state governments to create exchanges without giving states a monetary benefit in return, foisting new expenses on state governments without accompanying relief. That\u2019s why I wrote in the op-ed that establishing exchanges is \u201cnot a condition for receiving federal funds\u201d\u2014for states. If ordering a state to do something violates principles of federalism, then surely ordering a state to do something and promising to do it anyway if the state refuses also violates federalism. As I wrote in the op-ed, Obamacare\u2019s this-is-going-to-happen-whether-you-like-it-or-not approach \u201crenders states little more than subdivisions of the federal government.\u201d The context makes clear that the op-ed is talking about states and what Obamacare requires states to do. Tax credits to individuals are a different beast. I, like many of my colleagues, expected the President would follow the letter of his own law. Unfortunately for the American people, those expectations have not been met.\u201d\n\nCornyn has perhaps the weakest defense\u2014and he is listed as the first author of the Supreme Court brief. He asked his \u201chypothetical\u201d question months after the Cannon/Adler paper was published, at around the time at least one other GOP lawmaker was raising questions about the IRS rule. His concerns about the budget make little sense if one believes that the citizens in about three-quarters of the states would not qualify for premium subsidies. (Update: Brandewie counters: \u201cHis concerns would make perfect sense if the Administration was proposing to provide subsidies to a huge swath of people who might not otherwise qualify \u2013which they were.\u201d Of course, The Fact Checker continues to wonder why he didn\u2019t actually say that in the first place, as Jenkins did.)", "lang": "en"}
