We\u2019re the most uninsured state in the U.S.\"\n\nIt\u2019s an exaggeration, we\u2019d suggest, to say that all uninsured individuals don\u2019t have any health care. As we concluded in a 2010 fact-check, many avenues exist to make care available--including paying out of pocket and going to hospital emergency rooms. Still, many people don't get the care they need.\n\nA slightly different 1-in-6 statement appears on Valdez\u2019s campaign website: \"1 in 6 Texans lack health insurance,\" Valdez says on the \"Health Care\" portion of the site. She goes on: \"The truth is, we\u2019re already paying for universal healthcare, we are just doing it in the most expensive and inefficient (way) possible.\"\n\nValdez, calling Republican Gov. Greg Abbott foolish for rejecting the option of expanding Medicaid in Texas as permitted by the Obamacare law, further says that as governor she\u2019ll push to reverse his decision.\n\nWe\u2019ve found validity to other claims that Texas has the greatest share of residents who lack health insurance. After Valdez spoke, we decided to look again at how Texas ranks.\n\nValdez\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to our email asking for her backup. But to our inquiry about the latest available data, Paul Fronstin of the Washington, D.C.-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, who previously advised us on the number of uninsured residents by state, pointed by email to a September 2017 Census Bureau report estimating that in 2016, Texas still had the nation\u2019s greatest share of residents without health insurance, 16.6 percent--or 1 in 6 people.\n\nThe Texas rate, the report says, was down from 17.1 percent the year before and 22.2 percent in 2013, according to information collected in the American Community Survey. In 2016, the report says, Alaska ranked second nationally with 14 percent of residents lacking coverage and Oklahoma was third with a 13.8 percent uninsured rate.\n\nAlso answering our query by email, the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Chris Lee shared its calculations indicating that in 2016, Texas led other states with 15 percent of residents lacking health insurance, per research connected to the bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey. According to the foundation, states ranking second and third in residents lacking coverage were Alaska (14 percent) and Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Utah (12 percent each).\n\nLee guided us next to a Kaiser chart showing that Texas in 2016 also had the nation\u2019s greatest share of uninsured residents younger than 65 (when residents qualify for Medicare). The Texas uninsured rate of 17 percent outpaced No. 2 Alaska\u2019s rate, 15 percent, a foundation chart says.\n\nWe spotted a more recent nongovernmental estimate. In May 2018, Gallup said that surveys the polling company took in 2017 asked respondents: \"Do you have health insurance coverage?\" For the 10th straight year, Gallup said, Texas had the nation\u2019s highest rate of uninsured residents, 22.5 percent, which was still an improvement from the uninsured rate Gallup gauged for Texas in 2013, 27 percent. In 2017, Gallup gauged, Massachusetts residents had the nation\u2019s lowest uninsured rate in 2017, 4 percent.\n\nSOURCE: Press release, Gallup, \"Uninsured Rate Rises in 17 States in 2017,\" May 9, 2018\n\nValdez said: \"One in six Texans don\u2019t have health care. We\u2019re the most uninsured state in the U.S.\"\n\nOne in six Texans in 2016 lacked health insurance, according to government surveys, and the state remained No. 1 for its share of residents without coverage. It\u2019s an exaggeration to say that all uninsured people have no health care.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
