Claims are being made that he is Abid Khan, the Superintendent of Police (SP) of MP\u2019s Rewa district.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the claim to be false.\n\nWe ran a search using relevant keywords and found a tweet by Official Handle of the Department of Public Relations, Government of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAs per the tweet, the policeman in the picture is NOT Abid Khan. The tweet also states that the police went to investigate after they received the information of mass gathering at a place despite the lockdown.\n\nThe tweet also states that the cop in the picture is the station in-charge, Rajkumar Mishra, who went to investigate the matter. A statement by IG Rewa was also attached to the tweet.\n\nThe statement also adds that following the incident, Mishra has been taken off duty and sub-inspector Shivpujan Singh Bishan has been appointed as the new station in-charge.\n\nThis proves that the narrative being shared by pictures is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
