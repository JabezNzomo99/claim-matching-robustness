No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that makes a living by publishing fictional stories often involving weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or strange accidents. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on August 29, 2017 titled \"Man on drugs breaks into a pet shop and eats 10 lbs of dog food\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nDenver, Colorado | A man with an extremely bad case of munchies was arrested last night after he broke into a pet shop and devoured over ten pounds of dog biscuits and dry food. Officers of the Denver Police Department arrived at the Dog Kingdom pet shop around 3:00 AM this morning after the store's alarm was triggered by a presumed intruder. Once on the site, they noticed a broken window and found 49-year old Wendell Garrison inside the store, chewing on some dog biscuits.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story went viral again in 2019, despite the fact that it seems to be using the mugshot of someone who was arrested in California for public intoxication:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a humor website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nOn March 20, 2019 the site added a new header that included the slogan \"Where facts don't matter\" to make it clearer to casual visitors the published content is fictional:\n\nThe site often uses images stolen without attribution from real news websites, sometimes showing real people who have nothing to do with the story, for example here:\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: FDA Did NOT Approve New Tranquilizing Darts for Children\n\u2022 Fake News: Retired CIA Agent Did NOT Confess on Deathbed He Killed Marilyn Monroe\n\u2022 Fake News: 91-Year-Old Catholic Nun Did NOT Auction Her Virginity To Rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral in France\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Fake Being Deaf and Dumb for 62 Years to Avoid Listening to Wife", "lang": "en"}
