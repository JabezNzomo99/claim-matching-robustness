Friends, these are AAP\u2019s thoughts, you also think about it. Will Allah decide everything or you too will decide? Do you want to make Sharia or not??)\n\nThe above message was tweeted by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra along with a video clip of AAP leader Amanatullah Khan. Patra claimed that Khan was talking about creating a \u2018Sharia\u2019. It has amassed over 8,400 retweets so far.\n\nOn carefully listening to the speech, we found that Amanatullah Khan is saying \u2018Zaria\u2019 (medium) and not Sharia. At 45 seconds in the speech, he can be heard saying, \u201cAllah is the one writing it, isn\u2019t it? Allah has decided who will become the king, Allah has decided who will win. Allah has decided who will be shamed. Allah has decided who will have respect. That is under Allah\u2019s jurisdiction, under the jurisdiction of revenge, it crushes everything. What status do we have? Everything is of Allah and Allah has decided the oppressors will fall, this will end. The oppression that did, their persecution will end, Inshallah from Okhla, from Jamia. Inshallah, we will become the medium, it begins from somewhere. Today, Shaheen has awakened the world. Inshallah.\u201d\n\nIn the video, a logo which reads, \u2018Breaking News\u2019 can be seen. With a relevant search on YouTube, we found a six-minute long video on a YouTube channel called, \u201cBreaking News Express\u201d. The title of the video, posted on February 2. reads, \u201cAMANULLAH KHAN, JAMIA MLA, WARNS ABOUT CAA, NRC & NPR\u201d. The viral portion of the video begins after 3 minutes.\n\nThus, Sambit Patra\u2019s claim that Amanatullah Khan was talking about Sharia law, is false. Moreover, the sentence \u201cWe will become Sharia\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense. One cannot \u2018become\u2019 Sharia or Shariat which is the religious law in Islam dictating social, religious, political, economic, cultural rules of living.\n\nThe video is viral on Twitter and was subsequently shared by BJP National Secretary Y Sathya with a claim that he is talking about creating Sharia.\n\nFilm director Vivek Agnihotri quote-tweeted Sambit Patra and said, \u201cNatural speech, We will finish the oppressors, we will become Sharia \u2013 AAP Amanatullah Khan\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
