Chief Inspector (Excise) Lakshmi Durgaiah, who led the arrest, told BOOM that the accused were neither hoisting any flag nor did they have any known RSS connection.\n\n\n\nThe viral video shows a police officer asking a burqa-clad person to remove the cloth. The person turns out to be a man who then squats along with other men apprehended by the cops.\n\nA Hindi caption with the viral post (archive) translates to 'This RSS pimp was waving a Pakistani flag while dressed in a burqa. Muslims, be alert. This seems to be a new ploy to defame the community'.\n\nAnother post (archive) with the same video has a Hindi caption which translates to 'An innocent bhakt caught in burqa. He was trying to defame Muslims'.\n\nThe video is viral on Twitter with similar captions.\n\n\n\nView the archives here and here.\n\nCongress leader Salman Nizami also shared the post with the caption, \"Just to defame Muslims!\"\n\nAlso Read: Video Of Bahrain King's Robot Bodyguard?

Watch the video below.\n\nWe also found a report published in Telugu news portal NTV that had carried screenshots from the same video.\n\nThe report mentions that the police had arrested burqa-clad men who bought liquor at cheaper price in Telangana and sold them at higher prices in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nBOOM then contacted a local reporter in Kurnool who confirmed to us that the incident shown in the video did happen in the district, and sent us an extended version of the clip. The longer version of the video shows the apprehended men squatting in front of the confiscated liquor bottles.\n\nBOOM also contacted Chief Inspector (Excise), Kurnool district, Lakshmi Durgaiah who had led the arrests. The inspector denied any communal angle in the the crime.\n\n\"These men are liquor smugglers, and they were wearing burqas to hide themselves. They have no known connections to the RSS, and were not hoisting any kind of flag,\" he told BOOM.\n\nAlso read Tokyo 2020 Olympics Fireworks Show? No, It Is A Simulated Video", "lang": "en"}
