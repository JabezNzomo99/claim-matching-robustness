This is false; the image is of a cell tower in the US state of Arizona and was taken in 2009, almost a decade before 5G technology emerged.\n\n\u201cYes that is a 5G tower disguised as a cactus courtesy of the trump administration,\u201d one false post claims.\n\nSimilar posts are available here and here, and the false information has also been shared more than 30,000 times in Spanish.\n\nA Google reverse image search reveals that the photo is cropped from a wider scene.\n\nSearching for the full photograph yields an article titled \u201c25 Cell Phone Towers Disguised to Look Like Something Else,\u201d which credits an August 10, 2012 Reddit post for the photo and identifies the structure as a cell tower in Arizona.\n\nA second search for the photo plus \u201cArizona,\u201d with results limited to January 1, 2000 to August 10, 2012, yields this article, which credits James S. Wood of the Arizona Daily Star for taking the photo in 2009.\n\n\u201cYes I took that photo,\u201d Wood confirmed in an email to AFP, noting that it was common practice for the state to disguise cell towers as Saguaro cactus and palm trees \u201cto make them more appealing.\u201d\n\n\u201c5G didn\u2019t exist at that time,\u201d Wood said.\n\n5G technology, which promises revolutionary internet speed and telecommunications, is also a source of controversy and conspiracy theories. It began to expand commercially worldwide in 2018, almost a decade after Wood\u2019s photo was posted online.\n\nThe crane in the full image belongs to US business Ross Equipment Rental, which, according to their website, operates in three Arizona cities: Phoenix, Tucson and Prescott.\n\nThe image caption in the Arizona Daily Star article indicates that the cell phone antenna was installed near Sunrise Drive.\n\nSearching the Antenna Search portal, which maps cell tower installations in the United States, for Sunrise Drive in Tucson results in the record of a 34-foot structure on the street belonging to telephone company T-Mobile, registered in 2009.\n\n\u201cThis is a T-Mobile site,\u201d a company representative confirmed in an email. \u201cThere have been no upgrades on this site for a number of years, this photo is not current. The camouflage is to ensure compliance with the local permits specific to this site, it is not intended to \u2018hide\u2019 the cell site for any other purpose.\u201d\n\nCovering cell towers with fake trees and cacti is popular, and some city ordinances even require builders to \u201cminimize adverse visual effects.\u201d Various US companies offer this service.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked several false claims about 5G, available here and here.", "lang": "en"}
