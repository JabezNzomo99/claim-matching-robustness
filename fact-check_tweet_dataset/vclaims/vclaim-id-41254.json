It could have been the source of my breast cancer.\u201d She said she was now back to drinking cow\u2019s milk and wanted to pass this information to women.\n\nIs there a direct link between soya and breast cancer?\n\nFor weeks we unsuccessfully tried to contact Mugo about her claim, including through her senate media team and her cancer foundation, launched in 2016. We will update this report should we hear back from her.\n\ndata from May 2019 shows that 5,985 of the\n\nin 2018 were those of the breast.

Dr Zora Djuric is a\n\n. She studies the role of nutrition in cancer prevention.\n\n\u201cIn general, soy foods are healthful and can even be cancer-preventive, as many studies have shown,\u201d Djuric told Africa Check.\n\nin Atlanta, Georgia, US, came to the same conclusion.\n\nSoya had been in the Asian diet for thousands of years and soya foods \u201care among the healthiest for human consumption\u201d, Kucuk wrote.\n\n\u201cWe now have evidence that soy foods not only prevent breast cancer but also benefit women who have breast cancer. Therefore, we can recommend women to consume soy foods because of soy's many health benefits.\u201d\n\nAfrica Check asked Kucuk if there had been further findings since he wrote the piece.\n\n\u201cThe information in the editorial is still valid,\u201d he told us. \u201cSoy foods are safe and prevent breast cancer and other cancers.\u201d\n\nJury still out on supplements made from soya\n\n\n\n Mugo would have been on slightly firmer ground had she focused on supplements from soya. \n\n\n\n say that while soya foods are healthy, concerns have been raised about the breast cancer risk posed by soya supplements.

This principle holds for many food components.
