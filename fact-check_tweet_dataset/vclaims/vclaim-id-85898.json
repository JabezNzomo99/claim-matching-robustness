When Santorum cited these figures at the summit, some in the crowd responded: \u201cWow.\u201d The next day, he repeated the claim with a focus on the purported decrease in native workers since 2000.\n\nThe report found 127,000 fewer working-age, native-born Americans were employed in 2014 than in 2000, even though the working-age population grew by 16.8 million during that time. In comparison, there were 5.7 million more immigrants with a job in 2014 than in 2000, and the working-age immigrant population grew by 8.8 million. That is where the 5.7 million \u201cnet new jobs\u201d figure comes from, which Santorum rounded up to 6 million in his speech.\n\nSantorum\u2019s claim that the number of native-born workers has gone down since 2000 is on shaky ground. The report he quotes calculated a range of workers from 16 to 65 years old, which does not include the growing number of Americans working beyond age 65. The more comprehensive number, which is the range used by BLS, is workers 16 and older (with no age cap). There were 2.6 million more native-born Americans 16 and older in 2014 than in 2000, which contradicts Santorum\u2019s claim.\n\nThe report mentions this difference in a footnote: \u201cComparing the first quarter of 2000 to the same quarter in 2014 for the working-age shows that all of the employment growth has gone to immigrants. However, looking at all workers 16-plus shows that natives over age 65 did make employment gains. \u2026 Thus natives did make some employment gains, but it was entirely among those over age 65.\u201d\n\nThis is an important distinction because it is unique to the native worker population. For immigrant workers, there are about 810,000 more workers in 2014 than in 2000 than in the 16-65 range. The increase in older workers does not affect the immigrant worker population nearly as much as it does the non-immigrant population.\n\nThe breakdown of the number of age 65+ workers is not available in the report for 2000 to 2014. But the trend of an increasingly older native workforce is evident when looking at the labor participation breakdown of natives 60-65 years old. In 2000, the labor force participation was at 44 percent. In 2014, it was 53 percent. This was the only age group that saw an increase in this rate.\n\nSteven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, noted the numbers changed based on the year selected. If you picked 2010 as the starting year, there were 4.4 million more U.S.-born workers who are 16 or older in 2014 than in 2010. When 2007 is the starting year, the number changes again: There were 1.5 million fewer native-born workers in 2014 than in 2007.\n\nThe foreign-born population grew disproportionately as a share of the labor force, compared to their growth as a share of the general population, according to the Brookings Institution. It is also important to keep in mind the proportion of immigrant workers to the U.S. labor force: BLS data show the 25.3 million immigrant workers in 2013 comprised 16.3 percent of the total work force. While it is not possible to accurately quantify undocumented immigrants, the Pew Research Center\u2018s most recent estimates show 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants were working or looking for work in 2012. In addition, the number of unauthorized immigrants has decreased since it peaked in 2007.\n\nSantorum implies that native jobs are shrinking at the expense of immigrant jobs. But that is an oversimplification, if not incorrect, said Harry Holzer, economist and professor of public policy at Georgetown University. Low-skilled, low-wage jobs in industries dominated by immigrants took a bigger hit at the beginning of the recession. But they also bounced back quicker, as employers resisted committing to higher-wage employees until they saw the recovery was going to last, Holzer said. Broader-based recovery has helped native-born workers, he said.\n\nImmigrants add competition in some industries, such as residential construction, and among the younger population (ages 16 to 19) who are working part-time or summer jobs. But there is less competition in the higher-wage, higher-skilled jobs that require higher education. Most of the fastest-growing industries with rapid immigrant worker growth are low-skilled, such as iron and rebar workers, pipelayers and home health aides, the Brookings report shows.\n\nSantorum said that all 6 million net new jobs went to immigrants and that there are fewer native-born workers since 2000. That sounds \u201cwow\u201d-worthy. He correctly uses the numbers from the Center for Immigration Studies\u2019 report. But the figures he cites do not tell the full story, especially the number of Americans working in 2014 compared to 2000.\n\nThere has been job growth in the native-worker population; from 2010, that population has seen more growth than the immigrant population. So using the net new jobs figure is misleading. The number of native-born workers Santorum cites does not include the growing number of older Americans who are retiring later. When using the more comprehensive age range of workers \u201c16 and older,\u201d there are 2.6 million more native workers in 2014 than in 2000. This is a far different picture than Santorum paints. As we have said before, it is the responsibility of the speaker to check out the methodology and caveats before citing a study \u2014 especially if the figure is repeated to large audiences over two consecutive days.", "lang": "en"}
