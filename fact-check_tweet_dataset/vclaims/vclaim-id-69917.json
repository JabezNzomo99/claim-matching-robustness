Now, Harris is accusing his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, of wanting to take legal steps to remove Trump from the Oval Office.\n\n\"In our debate, Dan McCready doubled down on his support for Pelosi\u2019s liberal agenda of gun control, disrespecting our flag, and impeaching our President,\" Harris tweeted after a televised debate on Oct. 10. The tweet was shared more than 160 times.\n\nIs that really what McCready said?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the tape.\n\nThe full debate is available on the Charlotte Observer website. Part of the debate is also available on c-span.org, which also has a partial transcript to make the candidates\u2019 comments more easily trackable. (C-Span missed the first few minutes of the debate because it was broadcasting other news)\n\nFor this fact check, PolitiFact is choosing to focus on the most specific claim, that McCready wants to impeach Trump.\n\nIf you watch the debate, though, you\u2019ll see that McCready said he favors \"common sense\" gun background checks, without elaborating on what that policy might look like. And McCready said he stands for the flag but added that he understands that someone who\u2019s faced discrimination may kneel \"because he or she doesn\u2019t feel heard.\"\n\nMcCready has repeatedly said he won\u2019t vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker if Democrats gain control of the House. Harris, for his part, pushed back against McCready\u2019s claim that he won\u2019t support Pelosi as speaker, arguing that McCready\u2019s individual vote for House speaker wouldn\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things.\n\n\"There\u2019s a certain naivete, if you will, to think that you\u2019ll go to Washington as a Democrat and not support Nancy Pelosi who frankly is spending that $350,000 ... to run negative ads against me,\" Harris said. \"There\u2019s a reason for that. If Mr. McCready is elected, he just represents a number that would move the Democrats toward a majority.\" If that happens, \"Nancy Pelosi has already done the math. She will become the speaker.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth occurs between the 27- and 30-minute marks of the C-Span video.\n\nSpeaker or not, Pelosi herself hasn\u2019t committed to impeaching Trump.\n\nRepublicans this election season have raised the possibility that Democrats might impeach the president. But, as our friends at FactCheck.org noted in March, Pelosi hasn\u2019t called for Trump\u2019s impeachment and has voted to table two attempts at impeachment, effectively stopping them. With the election nearing, Pelosi has maintained her position that impeachment isn\u2019t a priority, but she hasn\u2019t ruled it out.\n\nSo what about McCready? Did he say in the debate that he\u2019d vote to impeach Trump?\n\nJust before the 26-minute mark of the C-Span video, a moderator notes that Democrats could gain control of the House in this year\u2019s elections. If that happens, some Democrats might try to impeach Trump.\n\n\"If you get elected, would you support that or would you not?\" the moderator asks.\n\nMcCready didn\u2019t offer a yes or a no.\n\n\"These kinds of decisions are very serious decisions and they\u2019re decisions that need to be handled based on the facts and the evidence. As a small business owner, I don\u2019t deal in hypotheticals, I deal in the facts,\" McCready said. \"That is a decision \u2014 or, any decision related to the Constitution \u2014 that I would treat very seriously based on the facts at the time.\"\n\nHarris didn\u2019t press McCready on impeaching Trump and the conversation moved on.\n\nThe Harris tweet says McCready in the debate \"doubled down\" on his support for impeaching Trump. But PolitiFact could find no evidence of McCready declaring that desire previously.\n\nIn fact, several news articles noted that McCready is noncommittal about the prospect of impeachment, specifically. And he\u2019s been criticized for being \"too vague.\"\n\nIn August, the Charlotte Observer quoted him saying the same phrase, \"I don\u2019t deal in hypotheticals,\" that he used in the debate. Also in August, the New York Times wrote that McCready \"has shown little appetite to talk about impeachment.\"\n\nThe Times story noted, however, that California billionaire Tom Steyer, \"who has led a national pro-impeachment effort all year, has pledged $500,000 to aid\" McCready.\n\nHarris tweeted that in his Oct. 10 debate with McCready, McCready \"doubled down on his support for Pelosi\u2019s liberal agenda of ... impeaching our President.\"\n\nMcCready has consistently distanced himself from Pelosi. Regardless, neither Pelosi nor McCready has committed to impeaching Trump. By not opposing impeachment, they\u2019ve left the door open to the idea. But that\u2019s not the same as publicly stating it\u2019s part of the Democratic or McCready agenda. We rate this claim False.", "lang": "en"}
