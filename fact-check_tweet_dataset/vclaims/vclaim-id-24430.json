Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nA viral post on social media reads: \u201cCASHEWS are natural anti-depressants. 2 handfuls of cashews is the therapeutic equivalent of a prescription dose of PROZAC.\u201d The post is shared on Facebook by a user named Jenna Lundgren.\n\nA claim getting viral in which two handfuls of cashews have wholly replaced prescribed antidepressant, Prozac.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by searching online reports on the viral claim. The claim appeared to be taken from an article published at the website doctoryourself.com. As per the article titled \u201cAn alternative to Prozac\u201d, \u201cone big handful of cashews provides one to two thousand milligrams of tryptophan, which will work as well as prescription antidepressants\u2026 but don\u2019t tell the drug companies.\u201d\n\nOn searching the details of the author of the article, Vishvas news found that Dr. Andrew Saul who related Cashews and Prozac for tryptophan content is a Nutritionist and not a Psychiatrist.\n\nWe found a report on Medical Daily website, titled \u2018Diet For Depression And Anxiety: 5 Natural Mood-Enhancer Foods To Lift Your Mind\u2019. It stated: Cashews are also a good option since they contain iron, magnesium, Vitamin B6, protein, and important amino acids and even omega 3 fats. Cashews contain tryptophan, which is critical for improving the uptake of serotonin in the brain, reducing feelings of depression.\n\nAs per the article on Medical Daily, although Cashews can help in natural mood-lifting to reduce depression, the claim that two handfuls of Cashews can become the therapeutic equivalent of a prescription dose of Prozac in treating depression is questionable. We researched and found no medical documentation supporting the viral claim.\n\nVishvas News spoke to DR ANIL YADAV who is a Psychiatrist at AIIMS, Delhi. He said, \u201cProzac is an anti-depressant and cashews cannot replace them. This is not true that two handfuls of cashew can replace Prozac.\u201d\n\nWe also spoke to Dr. Anil Tambi who is a Psychiatrist at Sawai Man Singh Hospital, Jaipur. He said, \u201cNo, cashews cannot replace Prozac. This is not true.\u201d\n\nWe also spoke to a General physician, Dr. Sajeev Kumar. He said, \u201cNo, not medically documented that cashews are natural anti-depressants. Two handfuls of cashews are not the therapeutic equivalent of a prescription dose of Prozac.\u201d\n\nThe claim that two handfuls of cashews are the therapeutic equivalent of a prescription dose of PROZAC is fake.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
