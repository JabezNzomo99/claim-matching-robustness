But the image in the report has been doctored from a photo of a demonstration against an economic stimulus program implemented by the administration of then-president Benigno Aquino in 2014.\n\nThis report on a website called \u201cPilipinas Online Update\u201d says that photos have been circulating online showing protesters demanding payment.\n\nIt was published in 2016, the URL shows, and has been shared more than 7,400 times by different Facebook accounts since, according to data from social media monitoring app Crowdtangle.\n\nIts headline, translated to English, says: \"Rallyist Asking for Payment! \u2018Payment should be given now\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the online report, written in a mixture of English and Tagalog:\n\nIn the image contained in the report, the yellow text on the blue banner translates as: \"Pay the rallyists now!!! Kabataan partylist\u201d, while the red text on the white banner translates as: \"Payment to rallyists should be given now! KMU Bayan Muna ACT Gabriela\u201d.\n\nKabataan partylist is a sectoral political party representing Philippine youth. KMU refers to Kilusang Mayo Uno, a labor center advocating for trade unionism. Bayan Muna and Gabriela are sectoral political parties, while ACT refers to the Alliance of Concerned Teachers, a teachers\u2019 activist group.\n\nFacebook posts that link to the misleading report include this one dated November 26, 2016, shared more than 5,800 times, and this one published the same month.\n\nThe same image of the protesters supposedly demanding payment was also featured in this Youtube video published February 18, 2017, which has been viewed nearly 100,000 times.\n\nThe image has been doctored; a reverse image search on Google led to this Facebook post published by Philippine news site GMA News on July 13, 2014.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the image in the misleading 2016 article (top) and the 2014 photo posted by GMA News (bottom):\n\nIn the photo from the GMA News Facebook post, the yellow text on the blue banner translates as: \u201cAquino, you should be ousted now!\u201d and the red text on the white banner translates as: \u201cYou should be put in prison!\u201d\n\nAquino refers to Benigno Aquino III, also known as \u201cNoynoy\u201d, who was president of the Philippines between 2010 and 2016.\n\nThe GMA Facebook post\u2019s caption says: \u201cAt least two militant groups are expected to file impeachment complaints against President Noynoy Aquino this coming week\u201d.\n\nIt links to this GMA News article published July 13, 2014, about protests against an economic stimulus initiative whose key parts were later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, as reported at the time here by local news site SunStar.\n\nProtests were also held in November 2016 \u2013 around the time the misleading online article emerged \u2013 following the burial of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the national cemetery of heroes. Here is AFP\u2019s report on those demonstrations.\n\nThe misleading report says those who were demanding for payment came from the \u201cAnti-Marcos Rally\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
