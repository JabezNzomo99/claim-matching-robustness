He wasn\u2019t on Microsoft\u2019s board of directors \u2014 a claim we recently debunked. But more misinformation abounds, and one Facebook post pads his resume with some new positions.\n\n\"Whoa!\" the May 12 Facebook post says. \"Dr Fauci was on Clinton Foundation Board for 20 yrs? Currently serves on Gates Foundation? #InvestigateFauci\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nBrian Cookstra, a spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation, told PolitiFact that Fauci has never served on the board in any capacity. He\u2019s not listed among the current board members, which you can see here, nor did we find any credible news stories or sources online that identify him as a former board member.\n\nFauci also is not listed among the leadership team members on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation website, including the executive leadership team headed by Bill and Melinda Gates and the global health division. He also isn\u2019t listed on the Scientific Advisory Committee.\n\nFrom 2003-10 Fauci, among 21 other scientists, served on a Gates Foundation scientific board to \"guide and direct\" a new initiative to \"identify critical scientific challenges in global health and increase research on diseases that cause millions of deaths in the developing world.\" The Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative was aimed at AIDS, malaria and other diseases, and Gates announced at the time that it would be administered by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, which agreed to provide scientific advice and support. The board that Fauci belonged to was formed to determine what \"grand challenges\" in global health could help thwart disease if they were solved. The initiative then provided grants to scientists around the world to look for solutions to the challenges.\n\nBut we found nothing to support what the Facebook post alleges.", "lang": "en"}
