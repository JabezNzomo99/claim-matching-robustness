The image suggested the president had blithely warned that relief checks from a COVID-19 stimulus package would only benefit people who had not published overt criticism of him on social media.\n\nYes, I ordered the Treasury Secretary to send checks to Americans! First however, we will go through your social media history from the last 4 years and search for any post with #NotMyPresident in it. I wouldn\u2019t think of offending you with a check if I\u2019m not your president! #MAGA\n\nWe found no evidence that Trump authored this tweet. Neither a database dedicated to archiving his posts, nor a database that stores all of his deleted tweets had a record of this post.\n\nAnother viral but false quote suggested that Trump said of the COVID-19 pandemic, \u201cPeople are dying today that have never died before.\u201d He did not.\n\nThe above-displayed fake tweet was posted as lawmakers discussed a federal stimulus package that may include checks sent directly to Americans as part of an economic stimulus plan.\n\nAs countries across the globe have worked to slow the spread of COVID-19, they have implemented various strategies of social distancing and quarantine measures that have resulted in widespread job losses and work-hour reductions.", "lang": "en"}
