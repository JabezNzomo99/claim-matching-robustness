That word means \u201ccoming together,\u201d and Democratic delegates stayed apart because of the still-spreading coronavirus disease.\n\nIt would have been more accurate to call the two-hour show the Democratic National Diaspora.\n\nThe two-hour infomercial on Aug. 17 was long on pre-recorded speeches, testimonials and musical interludes, but short on facts. Nevertheless, we found a few claims that merit a mention.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders claimed that raising the federally required minimum wage to $15 an hour would \u201cgive 40 million workers a pay raise and push the wage scale up for everyone else.\u201d That\u2019s debatable, and ignores the likelihood that many low-wage workers would find themselves priced out of the job market.\n\nSanders is once again citing a statistic generated by the Economic Policy Institute, which has backing from labor unions and advocates the $15 wage proposal. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects a much less dramatic impact, and some probable costs.\n\nCBO estimated most recently, in a report released in July 2019, that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 would \u201cincrease the wages of 17 million workers whose wages would otherwise be below $15 per hour.\u201d That\u2019s 17 million, not 40 million.\n\nCBO added, \u201cAnother 10 million workers otherwise earning slightly more than $15 per hour might see their wages rise as well.\u201d That\u2019s perhaps 10 million, not \u201ceveryone else\u201d who would see a ripple effect.\n\nAnd CBO also projected the probability that 1.3 million low-wage jobs would simply be lost, something Sanders ignores. (Here CBO admitted to a wide range of uncertainty among economists, putting the odds at 2 out of 3 that the actual number of jobs lost would fall somewhere between zero and 3.7 million.)\n\nActor Eva Longoria Baston, who served as a master of ceremonies for the night, left out some context when she said the Trump administration \u201cdisbanded the pandemic response team that was given to them.\u201d\n\nIn May 2018, the Trump administration eliminated the National Security Council\u2019s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense, which had been set up by the Obama administration in 2016 following an Ebola outbreak in West Africa. But as we have written, the dissolution of the office does not necessarily mean that the entire team was let go or that all of its functions ceased.\n\nAt the time, the Washington Post reported that Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, who had led the unit, abruptly departed under a reorganization effort orchestrated by former National Security Adviser John Bolton. An NSC spokesman told the Post that the administration \u201cremains committed to global health, global health security and biodefense, and will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.\u201d\n\nWriting in the Post earlier this year, Tim Morrison, former senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense for the NSC, argued that the office had not been \u201cdissolved.\u201d Instead, it was one of three units consolidated into the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate, \u201cgiven the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation, weapons of mass destruction terrorism, and global health and biodefense.\u201d\n\nOther ex-officials and experts believe the lack of a point person for a pandemic-specific response hinders the ability of the government to respond to such events. In a competing op-ed, Beth Cameron, the former senior director for the global health security and biodefense office, wrote in the Post that disbanding that directorate \u201cleft an unclear structure and strategy for coordinating pandemic preparedness and response.\u201d\n\nAnd the Center for Strategic & International Studies recommended restoring the global health security position on the NSC in a November 2019 report. \u201cIt remains unclear who would be in charge at the White House in the case of a grave pandemic threat or cross-border biological crisis,\u201d the report reads, noting that such leadership is \u201ccritical in navigating challenging political issues like quarantines and travel bans and in communicating to and reassuring the American public.\u201d\n\nWe take no position on whether it was an error to eliminate the post or restructure the team. But Longoria Baston\u2019s summary lacks the full context of what happened.\n\nIn describing President Donald Trump as authoritarian, Sanders claimed that Trump \u201cthreatened to delay the election.\u201d If it was a threat, it was a hollow one because the president has no legal or constitutional authority to delay the election, experts told us at the time.\n\nSanders is referring to a July 30 Trump tweet that suggested the 2020 election should be postponed. The president claimed that an avalanche of mail-in voting in 2020 would result in \u201cthe most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history.\u201d Trump added, \u201cIt will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\u201d\n\nBut Jerry H. Goldfeder, a lawyer who teaches election law at Fordham University School of Law, told us at the time that only Congress can delay the election. \u201cIt is beyond remote that a divided Congress would postpone the election,\u201d Goldfeder said.\n\nIn an April 28 article in the New York Law Journal, Goldfeder explained: \u201cThe U.S. Constitution explicitly provides that a president\u2019s term is four years, and the new or re-elected president is sworn in at noon on January 20th. There is no provision or precedent for a sitting president to extend his term beyond then. \u2026 Congress alone has the authority to adjust this election timeline \u2014 provided there is sufficient time for either Biden or Trump to take the oath of office at noon on Jan. 20th.\u201d\n\nDefending Nevada\u2019s decision to pass a new state law sending mail-in ballots to all active voters amid the coronavirus pandemic, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada tried to put some bipartisan sheen on that decision by noting that the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state has sought to dismiss the Trump campaign\u2019s lawsuit challenging it.\n\nTrump \u201chas challenged us in court with a meritless lawsuit,\u201d Cortez Masto said, \u201cone that our Republican secretary of state has asked the judge to dismiss.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske asked a judge to dismiss the Trump campaign\u2019s lawsuit, but Cegavske opposed the law. At the time of the vote, Cegavske raised concerns about the cost of the changes, and she criticized Democrats for leaving her out of discussions and only allowing her to see a draft of the bill the day before the vote.\n\nDespite her opposition to the new law, the Trump campaign named Cegavske as a defendant in the lawsuit, as she is the state\u2019s top elections official. The lawsuit claims the new election law, which passed along partisan lines, would \u201cundermine the November election\u2019s integrity.\u201d The law was passed by the Democratic-controlled state Senate and Assembly, and the law was signed by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak.\n\nNow, however, Cegavske \u2014 who is being legally represented by the office of Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat \u2014 is asking a judge to dismiss the Trump campaign\u2019s lawsuit, arguing that the elections changes are the state\u2019s decision to make and that the Trump campaign and Republicans who filed the suit don\u2019t have the legal standing to bring the lawsuit.\n\nLongoria Baston also claimed that \u201cSocial Security beneficiaries count on the post office to get their checks.\u201d\n\nWhile some beneficiaries do still get paper checks in the mail, the vast majority of beneficiaries receive payments via direct deposit to a bank account or a prepaid debit card.\n\nAs of August, the Social Security Administration sent paper checks to 848,003 people who get either Social Security or Supplemental Security Income payments. That\u2019s about 1.2% of the 72,193,592 people who received payments that month, according to official data.\n\nMost beneficiaries have been required to receive their payments electronically since 2013.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
