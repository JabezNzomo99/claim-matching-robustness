He\u2019s headed to a third term! Or at least that\u2019s the claim now bouncing around the Internet.\n\nA reader recently emailed us to ask if we could check out something they\u2019d run into online -- a titled, \"Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run.\" As we'll see, it's another case of a satirical article being passed off as real.\n\nThe article with a Washington dateline began, \"President Barack Obama shocked the country this morning with news that he is running for a third term.\"\n\nIt went on to quote Obama at a press conference saying,\"\u2018I can\u2019t abandon the American people now when they need me more than ever. We\u2019ve come this far as a nation, now is not the time to do something different. This is the change you wanted and this is the change you\u2019re getting.\"\n\nThe article then quoted Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., telling CNN that he opposes Obama\u2019s decision. \"This defies everything the Constitution stands for,\" Paul is quoted as saying. \"We can not let this man have a third term.\"\n\nThe problem facing Obama, according to the article, is the 22nd Amendment, which prevents presidents from running for more than two terms. It was ratified in 1951.\n\nHowever, the article suggests that Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., has \"recently introduced\" a measure to abolish the 22nd Amendment -- which is \"exactly the kind of news that makes an Obama 2016 Presidential run possible.\"\n\nThe article closes with a comment from Paul Horner, purportedly an administration spokesman.\n\n\"Obama is guaranteed to win in 2016 and then we\u2019ll all be able to enjoy this great man for another four years,\" the article quotes \"Horner\" as saying. \"Things could not get any better for the American people. I\u2019m so stoked!\"\n\nSo is Obama really going to get around the Constitution to run for a third term?\n\nIn fact, people passing along this story by email appear not to have noticed that it comes from a satire site called the National Report.\n\nThe site\u2019s tongue-in-cheek says, in part, that \"the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report.\" The urban-legend investigation site has archived an even clearer disclaimer that has since been removed. The former disclaimer , \"National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.\"\n\nAs it happens, has been debunking similar \"third-term\" claims since 2009 -- the first year Obama was in office, when he was still three years away from running, legally, for his second term.\n\nThese earlier chain emails tended to focus on the amendment by Serrano. The National Report satire piece is correct to say that Serrano has introduced such legislation, but it\u2019s hardly as recent a development as the article suggests.\n\nAs FactCheck.org noted, Serrano introduced a similar measure numerous times during the presidencies of Bill Clinton ( , and early ) and George W. Bush ( , and ), with each bill dying in committee without coming to a vote.\n\n\"I introduce it as a matter of principle,\" Serrano told FactCheck.org. \"I do not believe there should be term limits for any elected official. Elections should be the deciding factor. I do not receive advice or support on this bill from the White House or any other source.\"\n\nThe of Serrano\u2019s repeal bill has, as is typical, attracted no co-sponsors and gone nowhere in committee. No one should be under the illusion that this is an idea going anywhere soon.\n\nWe asked a White House spokesman if he wanted to comment. He politely declined.\n\nA chain email now circulating links to an article headlined, \"Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run.\" The article comes from a satire website, and even if Obama wanted to do an end run around the constitutional prohibition, the vehicle to do it -- Serrano\u2019s bill -- has no hope of passage, much less any chance of ratification in three quarters of the states.
