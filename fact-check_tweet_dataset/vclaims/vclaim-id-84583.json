{"title": "Can BJP's 'Freedom of Speech' excuse cover up for PM following people who insult the dignity of women?", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.altnews.in", "date": "2017-09-09T20:35:17+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-84583", "url": "https://www.altnews.in/can-bjps-freedom-speech-excuse-cover-pm-following-people-insult-dignity-women/", "vclaim": "\u201c\u0926\u0947\u0916\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u0924\u0947\u0930\u0940 \u0907\u091c\u094d\u091c\u0924 \u0928 \u0932\u0942\u091f \u0932\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0935\u0930\u0940 \u091b\u094b\u0930\u0940 (Translation: Be careful that nobody rapes you)\u201c, is how a Twitter handle called shiv982 responded to another handle called Rofl_Sardarni. The biography of the Twitter handle which issued this underhanded rape threat states, \u201c[Student][@RSSOrg][Member @bjp4India] #mission2019 Honoured and blessed to be followed by prime minister sh. @narendramodi and @piyushgoyaloffc\u201c. The tweet has now been deleted and shiv982 has changed his Twitter handle to shivamhindu45.\n\nIn the last few days, the accounts that PM Modi follows on Twitter have come under spotlight. At AltNews, we wrote about the handles that PM Modi follow and were abusing Gauri Lankesh after her murder. This included one handle which said \u201cA bitch died a dog\u2019s death and all of her litter is crying in the same voice\u201c. We wrote another article where we detailed a partial list of serial abusers, sexist bigots, rumour mongers that PM Modi follows on Twitter. Other than Alt News, multiple people on social media and main stream media raised this issue. BJP finally had to issue a statement regarding the issue and this is what they had to say.\n\nThe central argument seems to be that Prime Minister Modi firmly believes in people\u2019s freedom of speech, \u201cHe is a rare leader who truly believes in freedom of speech and has never blocked or unfollowed anyone on Twitter. We have multiple examples of leaders curbing free speech on social media, including the previous PMO handle.\u201d\n\nAs far as freedom of speech is concerned, Gujarat Government had allowed a sedition case against Times of India journalists while PM Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. The sedition case was eventually shot down by Gujarat High Court. That doesn\u2019t speak very well for PM Modi\u2019s love for freedom of speech.\n\nHowever, even if PM Modi has had a change of heart regarding the same, can rape threats, character assassination, rumour-mongering which could lead to riots be characterised as freedom of speech?\n\nRishi Bagree, Alok Bhatt, Anurag Dixit and \u2018Narendra Modi News\u2019 are all followed by PM Modi on Twitter.\n\nNikunj Sahu who is followed by PM Modi says, \u201c\u092e\u0947\u0918\u093e \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0915\u0930 \u091c\u0948\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u0941\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092d\u094c\u0915\u093f \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0940 \u092c\u0939\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0947\u0964 \u0917\u094c\u0930\u0940 \u0932\u0902\u0915\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0928\u093e\u091f\u0915 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0915\u093e\u092e \u0939\u0948 \u0907\u0938 \u0915\u093e\u092e \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u092e \u0938\u0930\u0939\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0964 (Translation: A bitch like Medha Patkar is barking on her sister\u2019s death. Karnataka Government is responsible for Gauri Lankesh\u2019s murder and we support this)\u201c. Is this freedom of speech?\n\nIf all of this is freedom of speech, why did BJP have such a huge problem with the events in JNU? Is it \u2018Nationalistic\u2019 to brand women as prostitutes? Is it \u2018Nationalistic\u2019 to issue rape threats?\n\nThe claim that PM Modi doesn\u2019t unfollow anyone also looks suspect. Jwala Gurunath who had a spat with Delhi BJP Spokesperson Tajinder bagga was allegedly unfollowed by PM Modi.\n\nThe second part of the argument is even more specious. The statement issued by BJP IT Cell Head Amit Malviya states, \u201cPM following someone is not a character certificate of a person is not in anyway a guarantee of how a person would conduct himself. However, PM also follows Rahul Gandhi, who is an accused in loot and fraud. PM also follows Arvind Kejriwal, who abused him on Twitter and told a woman \u2018Settle Kar Lo\u2019 when she complained\n\n of a party member molseting her.\u201d\n\nPM follows Donald Trump who once stated in a private conversation \u201cGrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d while referring to a woman. He also follows Haryana CM ML Khattar who said \u201cIf they (women) want freedom, why don\u2019t they just roam around naked?\u201c. In the same capacity that PM follows Donald Trump and ML Khattar, PM also follows Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi \u2013 because they are established political leaders. Comparing following them to following party workers and enthusiasts is the most ridiculous argument ever.\n\nFinally, isn\u2019t the Prime Minister of the country supposed to lead by example? Or is the Prime Minister supposed to give indirect endorsement to such people by following them? All of them invariably feature the following their biography, \u201cProud/Blessed/ to be followed by PM Modi\u201c. People whom PM Modi follows are issuing rape threats, branding women as prostitutes, abusing them again and again. How on the planet can that be justified in any which way? Did you not deride the opposition on this same issue?\n\nRespected PM, kindly do not promote such shameful elements of the society. You represent India on the world stage.", "lang": "en"}
