Why is this not being shown on @BBCNews?!\u201d.\n\nHer tweet (since deleted) had received over 5,500 retweets. A Facebook post, making a similar claim, has been shared over 500 times.\n\nThe reason that the video is not being shown on BBC News is that it\u2019s not from this year, it\u2019s from 2013. It\u2019s also not from Pakistan; it was actually filmed in Egypt.\n\nThis YouTube video, uploaded in 2013, clearly shows the same footage\u2014only less zoomed in than the version shared by Ms Dickinson.\n\nAFP Fact Check have done an excellent job of confirming that the church in the video is St George Church in Sohag, Egypt.\n\nThis finding is also consistent with a Human Rights Watch article which contains witness reports of an attack on the St George Church in August 2013. The appearance of the building in the video matches images from media reports of that attack at the time.", "lang": "en"}
