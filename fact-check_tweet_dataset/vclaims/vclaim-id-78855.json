In the piece, Democrat Jeff Merkley also cited the debt burden shouldered by the state\u2019s university graduates.\n\n\"In Oregon today, the average debt upon college graduation is more than $24,000, with many students in debt $50,000 to $100,000,\" he wrote.\n\nAt least $24,000 on average? That\u2019s not chump change. For that money, students could splurge on a new car, plunk down a sizeable down payment on a first home or fly off on a very grand tour of Europe. In fact, $24,000 is almost half of the median annual household income in Oregon, according to the latest U.S. Census figures. We decided to focus our fact check on that statistic.\n\nJamal Raad, Merkley\u2019s spokesman, wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Oregon that the $24,000 figure comes from a June 2013 fact sheet from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning D.C. think tank. The average debt per borrower in Oregon is $24,370, according to the report. That figure includes both public and private universities, said David Bergeron, the center\u2019s vice president for post-secondary education policy.\n\nThe figure originated from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Household Debt and Credit Report, which provides a quarterly snapshot of trends in borrowing, including student loans.\n\nThe statistic comes from a sample of consumer credit data and accounts for federally backed and private loans students borrowed, said Matthew Ward, a spokesman for the bank.\n\nThe average amount borrowed by Oregon students is a bit less than the $24,810 U.S. average, according to the report. It also noted that 17.1 percent of Oregon consumers -- defined as those with a credit record -- carry student debt.\n\nThe report listed \"average debt per borrower,\" not average debt per college graduate. In other words, many students incur student debt even if they drop out and never graduate. Some students incur no debt.\n\nGraduates from Oregon colleges in 2011 incurred an average debt of $25,497, according to The Institute for College Affordability & Success, a nonprofit that tracks student debt.\n\nThe figures are for public and private schools and are based on voluntary reports submitted to college guidance company Peterson\u2019s, which administers a financial aid database.\n\nThe numbers are only as reliable as the universities are able to track and report. And college financial aid officers aren\u2019t always aware of private loans that can add up.\n\nThe institute\u2019s numbers indicate that debt amounts can vary widely for private colleges, some of which offer more generous financial aid packages than public universities. For example, Reed College graduates in 2011 left with an average debt of $20,840; Lewis & Clark College $22,956; Willamette University $25,932; and Linfield College $29,754.\n\nWe\u2019ll note here that student debt figures are generally calculated out of the pool of graduates who leave school with debt \u2014 about 63 percent of Oregon students, the institute said. In other words, about 37 percent of students in Oregon graduate debt free.\n\nThis matters because officials made similar statements about average debt per graduate in Ohio and Virginia, resulting in Half True rulings from sister PolitiFact organizations. They neglected to account for students who graduate without debt.\n\nMerkley, unlike the other politicians, did not talk about the \"average student\" but the \"average debt.\" We\u2019ll come back to this point later.\n\nFinally, we checked with the Oregon University System. The average debt of graduates in the class of 2011 across all seven state schools was $23,839, according to the OUS 2012 Fact Book. The figures are for federal loans borrowed by students at each institution. About 59 percent of graduates left with debt.\n\nMerkley said that the average debt upon college graduation in Oregon is more than $24,000.\n\nThe studies we found came up with three figures that largely back him up.\n\nThe studies calculated student debt in different ways, making apples-to-apples comparisons impossible even though they\u2019re all within range of one another. The studies also fail to account entirely for private loans students take out directly, which would likely increase the average student indebtedness amounts.\n\nStill, the reports back up Merkley\u2019s statement.\n\nThe only point left to quibble over is clarifying that 37 percent of students graduate from university in Oregon without any debt. That is additional information that could help readers understand that the $24,000 figure is among those who leave college in debt.\n\nUnlike officials in other states, Merkley did not write about the \"average kid\" or student incurring a certain amount of debt. He wrote about \"average debt\" upon graduation. That makes his statement accurate, but it needs additional information and context.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
