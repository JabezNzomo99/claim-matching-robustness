Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, that there was a whistleblower complaint of \"urgent concern.\"\n\nSept. 25, 2019: The White House releases a declassified summary of the July 25 telephone call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nSept. 26, 2019: Schiff makes opening remarks at a hearing with Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence. Maguire was questioned because he had not forwarded the inspector general\u2019s findings to conference.\n\nAt that Sept. 26 hearing, Schiff offered a dramatized synopsis of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. He described rhetorically the nature of Trump\u2019s message to Ukraine.\n\nTrump later latched on to Schiff\u2019s words, saying he was lying to the public.\n\n\"Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine,\" Trump tweeted Sept. 30.\n\nWe can find no other version of Schiff describing the call before the summary emerged.\n\nWe reached out to the White House and did not hear back.\n\nTrump said that the White House released a summary of his call with Zelensky after Schiff gave a false rendition of the call.\n\nThe summary came out before Schiff described the nature of the call at a hearing.", "lang": "en"}
