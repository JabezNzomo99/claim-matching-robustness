The UK government in February 2019, and has refused to let her come back.\n\nNevertheless, posts appeared on Facebook, Twitter and the EuroWeekly website in September claiming, without evidence, that \u201cShamima Begum is flying into the UK today\u201d.\n\n\u201cSecretly being flown in,\u201d the post continues. \u201cNo press coverage allowed for her safety. Being represented by Cherie Blair.\u201d None of this was true, as we said at the time.\n\nMs Begum lost her appeal against the UK government\u2019s decision in February 2020, but a screenshot of one of the original posts about her supposed secret return continues to be shared on Facebook. It offers no evidence for the claim.\n\nAs it happens, we know that Ms Begum was still in Syria beyond September 2019, because the ABC News correspondent James Longman recently interviewed her there. We contacted Mr Longman, who told us that the interview took place on 14 February 2020, in the al-Roj camp in the northeast of the country.", "lang": "en"}
