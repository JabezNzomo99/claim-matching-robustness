The claims are misleading; the renumeration for Australia and New Zealand\u2019s politicians is determined by independent statutory bodies, not the prime ministers; a salary freeze was indeed imposed on New Zealand\u2019s politicians in 2018, but it was in place to establish a fairer system that determines pay increases for key office holders, not because of economic conditions.\n\nThis post has been shared more than 2,000 times since it was published on Facebook on September 26, 2019.\n\nIt shows a photo of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on the top left-hand corner, and that of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on the bottom right.\n\nBeside Ardern\u2019s photo, the text reads: \u201cNZ PM refuses pay-rise & freezes politicians salaries until economy improves for citizens\u201d.\n\nThe text next to Morrison\u2019s photo states: \u201cAustralian PM gives himself a big pay rise, then cuts working class wages\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same meme has also been shared thousands of times on various Facebook pages here and here.\n\nIt has also been posted here on \u201cAustralia\u2019s Page\u201d, which is followed by more than 500,000 Facebook users.\n\nThe claims are misleading; the prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand do not set the pay of their countries\u2019 politicians; New Zealand politicians were subject to a salary freeze in 2018, but for other reasons than a bad economy.\n\nIn Australia, the pay for Members of Parliament (MPs) is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory authority established in 1973.\n\nThe Tribunal is required by law to conduct an annual review on MPs\u2019 pay and in 2019, it announced a two percent pay increase for public offices effective July 1, 2019.\n\nThe Tribunal said its decision was made based on \u201ceconomic conditions in Australia, past and projected movements in remuneration in the public and private sectors (including the Australian Public Service), as well as the outcomes of reviews of public offices completed by the Tribunal.\u201d\n\n2019 was the third consecutive year when the Tribunal handed down a two percent pay rise for all MPs, as seen in the table below:\n\nAs a result of the 2019 pay adjustment, Prime Minister Scott Morrison would receive a pay jump of just over $10,000, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported on June 7.\n\nOn the same day as the MPs received a pay rise on July 1, the third phase of a 2017 Fair Work Commission decision to cut weekend penalty rates for workers in retail, hospitality, fast food and pharmacy industries also came into force.\n\nAustralian trade union United Voice told AAP those workers could lose up to $2,000 a year under further penalty rate cuts.\n\nThat decision was made by the Fair Work Commission, an industrial relations tribunal, not the prime minister; in 2017, Morrison was serving as Australia\u2019s treasurer.\n\nHe was sworn in as the country\u2019s prime minister on 24 August 2018.\n\nSimilarly in New Zealand, the independent Remuneration Authority decides on the pay for key office holders.\n\nIn August 2018, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a government decision to freeze the salaries and allowances for all MPs for a year until July 2019, as the proposed pay increase was \u201cunacceptably high\u201d.\n\nThe pay freeze was not in place \u201cuntil economy improves for citizens\u201d as the misleading post claimed.\n\nIn August 2019, Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Iain Lees-Galloway said a fairer system that set MPs\u2019 pay increases had been established following the completion of a review that took place between 2018 and 2019.", "lang": "en"}
