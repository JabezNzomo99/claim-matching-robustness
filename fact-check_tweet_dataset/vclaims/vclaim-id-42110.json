According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), \u201cCurrently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes. Some people have certain genes (traits passed on from parent to child) that make them more likely to develop type 1 diabetes, though many won\u2019t go on to have type 1 diabetes even if they have the genes. Being exposed to a trigger in the environment, such as a virus, is also thought to play a part in developing type 1 diabetes. Diet and lifestyle habits don\u2019t cause type 1 diabetes.\u201d\n\nFor type 2 diabetes, however, prevention is possible by following a healthy lifestyle.
