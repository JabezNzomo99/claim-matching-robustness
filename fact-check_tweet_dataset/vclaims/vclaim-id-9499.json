Xochi Mochi read Todd Parr's children's book \"It's Okay to be Different\" to the children.\n\nLos Angeles drag queen Xochi Mochi took part in Drag Queen Story Hour at Long Beach public library in October 2017. A widely-shared photo of the event is authentic.\n\nIn October 2017, right-wing web sites reported with a significant degree of alarm that a drag queen in a \u201cSatan-inspired costume\u201d had read to children at a California public library associated with former First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nIn their headline, Conservative Fighters falsely claimed that Xochi Mochi had read a \u201csexually explicit\u201d book to the children. World News Daily reported:\n\nSetting aside for a moment the alarmist language used to describe this event, the Los Angeles drag performer Xochi Mochi (also known as Jorge Alcantar) did read to children at the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library in Long Beach, California, on 14 October.\n\nThe reading was part of a series called Drag Queen Story Hour, which is run by the writer Michelle Tea and the literary and arts non-profit Radar Productions. Here\u2019s how the Drag Queen Story Hour web site describes the project:\n\nThe photograph used in the reports mentioned above is authentic, and was posted to Facebook and Instagram by Xochi Mochi, who added:\n\nI got to read to the children today and it was one of the best experiences I\u2019ve been given as a drag queen. It\u2019s so important to have representation and normalize all the letters in LGBTQIA+ in everyday lives. I saw so many excited faces it filled my heart with so much joy and hope to come back again soon!\n\nLong Beach Public Library also posted the photograph to its Twitter account, but has since deleted that tweet. (An archived version can be viewed here.)\n\nRepublican candidate for Congress Omar Navarro asked in a tweet \u201cwhat are we teaching kids in school?\u201d and claimed the photograph of Xochi Mochi showed \u201cdemonic teachings.\u201d Setting aside the fact that the event took place at a library, not a school, the book Xochi Mochi is reading in the photograph is Todd Parr\u2019s children\u2019s book \u201cIt\u2019s Okay to be Different,\u201d which includes the following lines:\n\nThe web sites also made much of the fact that Xochi Mochi\u2019s costume involved horns, though there\u2019s no evidence that those horns are \u201cSatan-inspired.\u201d They could just as well have been inspired by the Greek gods Pan or Dionysus, both of whom are often depicted with horns. Or they could simply be Xochi Mochi\u2019s own invention. Satan and other Christian demons (as well as Pan and Dionysus) are typically portrayed with two horns, rather than the five that Xochi Mochi wore.\n\nShe was also wearing a pink dress and cape; a gem-encrusted necklace and bracelet; and flowers in her hair and on her cape \u2014 all of which are hardly in keeping with Satanist or demonic symbology and suggest that \u2014 like most drag \u2014 Xochi Mochi\u2019s appearance was driven by playfulness and eclecticism.\n\nContrary to Conservative Fighters\u2019s claim, there is no evidence whatsoever that Xochi Mochi read the children anything \u201csexually explicit.\u201d\n\nFinally, Michelle Obama had no role in the event. The Conservative Fighters web site misleadingly referred to \u201cMichelle Obama\u2019s public library\u201d in its headline, suggesting that the former First Lady owns or operates the institution. She doesn\u2019t, but the library was named in her honor in September 2016.", "lang": "en"}
