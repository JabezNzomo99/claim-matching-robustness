Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cAttorneys don\u2019t know much about the law as lawyers do and Ben Shapiro is just an attorney. So, yeah.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez ever made the statement attributed to her in the post, though she has been critical of the conservative commentator in the past.\n\nOcasio-Cortez often draws the ire of conservatives. In this case, the meme questions her intelligence, suggesting that Ocasio-Cortez thinks there\u2019s a substantive difference between an attorney and a lawyer.\n\nThere is no evidence of Ocasio-Cortez ever saying the quote, however. The Daily Caller searched the web, social media and news coverage and could not find any proof that Ocasio-Cortez ever made the statement.\n\nThe quote can be found on meme websites and forums like Reddit. One such website categorizes the meme under \u201cmade up quotes.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no proof that the New York congresswoman ever made this statement, she has been critical of Shapiro, a graduate of Harvard Law School, in the past.\n\nIn August 2018, Shapiro offered Ocasio-Cortez $10,000 to debate him.\n\n\u201cI would love to have a real conversation with you about the issues. You\u2019ve noted that you think Republicans are afraid to debate you or talk to you or discuss the issues with you,\u201d Shapiro said in a video. \u201cNot only am I eager to discuss the issues with you, I\u2019m willing to offer $10,000 to your campaign, today, for you to come on our Sunday special.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez responded with a tweet comparing the offer to catcalling, saying that she did not owe Shapiro a response.\n\n\u201cJust like catcalling, I don\u2019t owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions,\u201d she said.", "lang": "en"}
