Swamy retweeted the image.\n\nOver a thousand people have retweeted the photo.\n\nMost of Jagga's tweets on his timeline have tagged Subramanian Swamy's Twitter account.\n\nJagga has also written a book named 'Guide to concept of GST'.\n\nSome Twitter users were quick to point out that shirt pockets are usually not sown on the right side.\n\nWe used Google's reverse image search tool to trace the original photograph.\n\nThe photograph by Associated Press (AP) photographer Kevin Frayer shows Rahul Gandhi along with other members of the Congress saluting the tricolour during a function for Independence Day in New Delhi in 2011.\n\nDespite BOOM and other factcheckers such as SM Hoax Slayer calling out the photo as fake, Jagga has not deleted his tweet.", "lang": "en"}
