David McKinley, R-W.Va., touted his state\u2019s economic performance in an Aug. 14 tweet.\n\nHe tweeted, \"West Virginia\u2019s economic comeback continues. Personal income tax collections up 14% from 2017. Most people working is good news.\"\n\nThe unemployment rate in West Virginia has been steady at either 5.3 percent or 5.4 percent since September 2017, lower than the state\u2019s rate for most of the period between 2009 and 2016.\n\nHere, though, we\u2019ll focus on McKinley\u2019s claim about tax collections.\n\nTo support this point, McKinley linked to an article in the Parkersburg News and Sentinel. However, the 14 percent figure doesn\u2019t appear in the article. So we decided to take a closer look.\n\nWe turned to the official state budget website and looked at the revenue collection data for July going back to 2000. This data does support McKinley\u2019s data point.\n\nIn July 2018, the state collected $145,494,000 in personal income tax revenues. By comparison, in July 2017, the state collected $128,146,000. That\u2019s an increase of 13.5 percent, which rounds up to 14 percent -- just as McKinley tweeted.\n\nFor historical perspective, that\u2019s well below the largest increases, but it\u2019s the third highest year-over-year increase since 2001.\n\nMcKinley wrote that in West Virginia, \"personal income tax collections (were) up 14% from 2017.\"\n\nThat\u2019s correct when you compare income tax collections in July 2018 to July 2017. It\u2019s also the third-largest July-to-July improvement since 2001. We rate the statement True.", "lang": "en"}
