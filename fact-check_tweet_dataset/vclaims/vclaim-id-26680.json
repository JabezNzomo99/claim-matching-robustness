But counting apprehensions in just that three-month period amounts to cherry-picking. Measured over a longer period of time, apprehensions under Trump are up instead of down.\n\nThe full 30-second campaign commercial \u2014 a version of which aired nationwide during the final game of the World Series \u2014 attacks Democrats for focusing on \u201cimpeachment and phony investigations\u201d while Trump is \u201cchanging Washington\u201d by creating millions of jobs, reducing illegal immigration, and \u201cobliterating ISIS.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson did not respond when we asked the campaign how it figures Trump is \u201ccutting illegal immigration in half,\u201d as the ad\u2019s narrator says.\n\nA version of the ad that aired in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Oct. 30, and was captured by Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group, does not mention a specific time period or include an on-screen citation. However, a version of the ad shared on Twitter by Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, uses the same language but includes a graphic that says \u201cFox News, 9/10/2019.\u201d\n\nThat day, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli talked about illegal immigration on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d with host Brian Kilmeade and said: \u201cThe president has literally thrown every domestic and international effort he can at this and it\u2019s paid off. As you noted Brian, we are down more than 50% since May in just three months.\u201d\n\nActually, total Southwest border apprehensions declined by nearly 62% from 132,856 in May to 50,684 in August. Still, that only counts three months of this year. Without that information, viewers of the ad could get the false impression that the TV spot is saying that Trump cut illegal immigration compared to a period before he was president. (The ad\u2019s claims that he \u201ccreated 6 million new jobs\u201d and \u201c500,000 new manufacturing jobs\u201d are mostly accurate and based on employment data that counts from when Trump took office until now.)\n\nBut as we wrote in \u201cTrump\u2019s Numbers October 2019 Update,\u201d since Trump entered office in January 2017, \u201c[i]llegal border crossings nearly doubled, as of the most recent 12 months on record.\u201d That was based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection data as of August. September data is now available from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which allowed us to compare fiscal years for this story \u2014 as illustrated in the chart below. (Note: There are technically no statistics for those who cross the border illegally, but apprehensions by CBP are used to measure such trends.)\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, there were 851,508 total apprehensions, which is the highest since 858,638 in fiscal year 2007.\n\nThe fiscal 2019 total is 115% higher than the 396,579 apprehensions in fiscal year 2018, and 180% higher than the 303,916 apprehensions in fiscal year 2017, which included almost four months of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and over eight months of Trump\u2019s.\n\nCompared with the 408,870 apprehensions in fiscal year 2016, the last full fiscal year before Trump took office, apprehensions during the most recent fiscal year were up 108%.\n\nBy all of those measures, border officials are catching more people at the border under Trump \u2014 not fewer.", "lang": "en"}
