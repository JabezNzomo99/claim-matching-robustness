That was the day Gerald Ford passed to his reward. Within 24 hours, there were 221 news articles.\n\nFor George H. W. Bush on July 1, 2018? Zero.\n\nThe president\u2019s spokesman Jim McGrath posted nothing on his Twitter account. If he was releasing a statement to the press as the article said, then for sure he would have done the same on Twitter. His most recent tweet was from June 26 with a letter from Bush supporting Houston\u2019s bid to host the 2020 Democratic convention. The day before, he retweeted a story about Bush getting a new dog named Sully. Former president Bill Clinton was there to welcome the dog, as well.\n\nBush has his own Twitter account. He congratulated the Republican gubernatorial primary winner in Colorado on June 27.\n\nHe also tweeted about the dog.\n\nFor the record, the surviving former presidents include Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nThe New York Timely Reports has a web address of www.nytives.com, which is one letter off from the New York Times website address, www.nytimes.com.
