On the old definition, official figures actually showed only a minority of Welsh exports going outside the UK to the European Union.\n\n67% of Welsh goods exports went to EU member countries outside the UK in 2015, according to figures released by HM Revenue and Customs in December. (68% is correct for the first three months of 2016.)\n\nBut when these statistics came out in June, they showed the EU taking only 41% of Welsh exports in 2015. What\u2019s going on?\n\nStatsWales told us that there have been two recent changes in how trade in goods is measured. Exports used to \u2018belong\u2019 to a particular country or region of the UK if the exporting business had its head office there.\n\nNow, exports are regionally allocated according to where the business\u2019s employees are based. The statisticians say that\u2019s made a big difference to the figures for Wales.\n\nThere\u2019s also been a change in how goods in customs warehouses and free zones are counted (they no longer are until actually sold in the UK).\n\nEither way, these figures only count goods exports. They don\u2019t touch on services.", "lang": "en"}
