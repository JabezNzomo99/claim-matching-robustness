The claim is false; the article was published on a site that has regularly produced hoax reports, and China has made no such announcement.\n\nScreenshots of the purported article were published here on Facebook on February 6, 2020.\n\nIt shows an article by \"City News\", headlined \u201cChina seek for court\u2019s approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus\u201d.\n\nThe text reads, in part: \u201cThe highest level of court in Chhina, Supreme People\u2019s Court, is expected to give an approval on Friday [February 7] for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus.\u201d\n\nThe novel coronavirus, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 has killed at least 1000 people and infected some 42,000 others in China alone, AFP reported here on February 11, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post's Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"Ayyyy This is too much .... it's really euthanasia ... tsk tsk ...\"\n\nAFP found the original article seen in the misleading post published here on a website entitled \"City News\" on February 6, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe \"City News\" article was also shared here on Twitter and here on Reddit alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe story was also shared by Lagos-based newspaper Independent Nigeria on its social media platforms here and here. The claim also appeared online here in Kenya, as well as here and here in Spain.\n\nThe claim is false; the Chinese Supreme Court did not make any such judgement on February 7.\n\nThe website where the claim appeared, ab-tc.com, has a history of producing hoax reports.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked a number of stories from the website, including a series of articles from August 2019 that falsely claimed that police thwarted mass shootings in several US cities, and an article published July 2019 claiming a nightclub in Canada was shut down for selling human meat.\n\nAll the articles on the website fact checked by AFP were published with the byline \u201cLocal Correspondent\u201d, suggesting no direct attribution of stories to specific authors.\n\nAb-tc.com does not have an \u201cAbout Us\u201d section with details of who is running the platform. There is also no disclaimer labelling its contents as fiction or satire.\n\nA search of Whois, a public database of domain name registration details, found that the website\u2019s domain was registered in Guangdong China with aUS-based Wild West Domains on June 14, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the results:\n\nAFP conducted keyword searches on the state-run China Internet Information Center on the proposed government plans, but found no results that matched the claim.\n\nChina\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Court website also does not mention any related hearings.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Chinese Supreme Court website\u2019s scheduled hearings section. None of the cases are related to the novel coronavirus:\n\nThe purported court case is also not among the daily situation reports of the World Health Organization.\n\nThe false euthanasia in China claim was also debunked by fact-checking websites Snopes and Africa Check.", "lang": "en"}
