The first step of this action would be to disarm the American people, and throw anyone that is, or might be, a threat into a detention center \u2014 a FEMA camp. During the course of the revolt, many will die, both in battle and in the camps \u2014 an inevitable circumstance Obama is already preparing for.The current President of the United States, amongst other things, has already ordered $1 Billion dollars worth of disposable coffin liners. Around the country is stored the 5 million, what will be, FEMA coffins in various locations.\n\nThis rumor resurfaced in October 2014 during the midst of public concern over an outbreak of Ebola, with claims that the coffins (or coffin liners) were being stockpiled in anticipation of a large number of fatalities from that disease in the U.S. However, the story and pictures are several years old, the objects shown have nothing to do with Ebola or FEMA or any other agency of the U.S. government, and the pictured items were around long before Barack Obama was first elected to the presidency of the U.S. in 2008.\n\nWhat\u2019s shown in the photos displayed with the \u201cFEMA camp\u201d story are not \u201cplastic coffins\u201d or \u201cdisposable coffins,\u201d but rather what\u2019s known as burial vaults or grave liners. These liners don\u2019t hold human remains in themselves; they\u2019re a protective shell that coffins are placed into before interment in areas where water seepage or ground subsidence is an issue.\n\nAs the Morgan County Citizen reported in 2008, tens of thousands of these liners were stored on leased land in Madison, Georgia, back in the 1990s by their manufacturer, the nearby Vantage Products Corporation (based in Covington, Georgia), for distribution to other areas on an as-needed basis. Since the coffin liners are made to withstand the elements, there was no need for Vantage to store them indoors, so they simply leased a large, unused outdoor field for use as a warehouse.\n\nNonetheless, Vantage\u2019s storage situation eventually gave rise to wild conspiracy theories which flared up in 2008, rumors that claimed some half million of the liners (about ten times the actual number being stored in Georgia) were the property of the U.S. government and were being stockpiled in anticipation of a biological disaster, the implementation of martial law, or the imprisonment of thousands of U.S. citizens in FEMA-run concentration camps:\n\nType in \u201cMadison, GA\u201d under Google\u2019s Blog Search, and it shows up on the first page. Search \u201cMadison, GA\u201d on YouTube, and it\u2019s the first video that shows up. Web sites like Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars.com and AboveTopSecret.com are talking about it.As of late, some of these sources have started to link the government, particularly the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to rows and rows of black, plastic \u201ccoffins,\u201d 500,000 to be exact, currently being stored outdoor in a field within the city limits of Madison. Theories abound as to whether these are being stored near a major transportation hub (Atlanta) in an effort by the government to prepare for American victims of biological warfare, or whether they are being stored for a natural, or man-made, disaster. Even more sinister, some of these sources speculate that these \u201ccoffins\u201d are part of a conspiracy on the part of the government that involves the institution of martial law, the separation of desirable and non-desirable citizens, according to government opinion, and the establishment of American concentration camps, some of which are currently functional, according to these sources. \u201cYep, these are cheap plastic coffins. Hundreds of thousands of them. Don\u2019t believe it? Why coffins? Why in the middle of Georgia?\u201d the entry \u201cHalf a Million Plastic Coffins?\u201d on Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars.com, dated July 18, states. \u201cWell, apparently the Government is expecting a half million people to die relatively soon, and the Atlanta Airport is a major airline traffic hub, probably the biggest in the country, which means Georgia is a prime base to conduct military operations and coordination. It is also the home of the CDC, the Center for Disease Control. I don\u2019t want to alarm anyone, but usually you don\u2019t buy 500,000 plastic coffins \u2018just in case something happens,\u2019 you buy them because you know something is going to happen. These air tight seal containers would be perfect to bury victims of plague or biological warfare in, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d While the origins of the theories are unclear, there are blog postings that date back to December 2007 (AboveTopSecret.com), although the majority of postings have come within the latter half of July. And, according to Vantage Products Corporation Vice President of Operations Michael Lacey, that\u2019s exactly when the calls started pouring in. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for quite a while, about a week,\u201d Lacey said. Lacey maintains that the theories regarding the property, and what\u2019s on it, aren\u2019t quite accurate. The \u201ccoffins\u201d aren\u2019t coffins at all, according to Lacey. Instead, they are burial vaults, \u201cthe outer container for caskets,\u201d Lacey said, placed in the ground before the coffin to protect the coffin and maintain level ground above. There are currently 50,000 of these burial vaults on the property, according to Lacey. As the vaults were placed on the site around 1997 or 1998, there may have been as many as 70,000 or 80,000 to begin with. \u201cIt\u2019s nowhere near the quantity they talk about on the Internet,\u201d Lacey said. This quantity of burial vaults, Vantage\u2019s Standard Air Seal model in black, also the least expensive model and the most in-demand, was made to cater to what Lacey calls the funeral industry\u2019s \u201cpre-need.\u201d This \u201cpre-need\u201d occurs when people make arrangements for their funeral before they actually pass away, so that the family doesn\u2019t have to go through the perceived stress of making the arrangements. When these arrangements are made, the products are paid for; obviously, though, they are not yet needed. So, Vantage stores the product until the person dies, and the product is needed. Further, pallets of the burial vaults are moved truckloads at a time, as there is space for a palate at the [destination]. Contrary to the beliefs of the theorists, then, the burial vaults aren\u2019t owned by the government, or FEMA. Instead, they\u2019re owned by individuals, or not yet sold. \u201cThey\u2019re not owned by any one individual, company or the government,\u201d Lacey said. Further, Vantage leases the land, located at 1200 Madison Industrial Boulevard, from Conyers Welding & Supply and has for four to five years, a fact confirmed by Conyers Welding & Supply. Conyers Welding & Supply took over the lease when the property was purchased from Robert Usury in 2000. Usury purchased the property in 1989, according to information provided by the Morgan County Tax Assessor\u2019s Office and the Morgan County Online Public Property Portal. The answer as to why the vaults are being stored in Madison? To put it simply, the Covington-based manufacturer got a good deal close to home. \u201cIt was the most cost-effective place,\u201d Lacey said.", "lang": "en"}
