None of these companies have closed stores. However all of a sudden all the meat packing plants are closing and small businesses are still not allowed to open. None of this makes any sense at all.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the five companies mentioned in the post have had employees test positive for coronavirus, and media outlets have reported on it.

For instance, CBS affiliate WRGB reported that two Walmart employees had tested positive for coronavirus. A Walmart store in Massachusetts closed in April after 23 employees tested positive, according to local affiliate NBC10.\n\nReuters reported in late March that 19 Amazon warehouses across the U.S. had positive cases of COVID-19. Other media outlets have also documented cases among Amazon employees at company facilities in New York, Connecticut, Delaware and Florida.\n\n13 employees at 10 different Kroger stores in the Louisville, Kentucky, division tested positive for COVID-19, according to local ABC affiliate WHAS.\n\nThere have been cases among Target employees in states such as North Dakota, Texas and Virginia, per media reports. Target employees in Georgia, North Carolina and California have also tested positive.\n\nIn late March, BuzzFeed News reported that Costco employees said managers in at least eight locations informed staff that a coworker had tested positive.

Amazon closed a warehouse indefinitely in Kentucky after three workers testing positive in March, according to Business Insider. A Walmart in Colorado was also closed by local authorities in late April after eight employees tested positive for COVID-19, Bloomberg reported.\n\nEssential small businesses, like local grocery stores and pet stores, have been permitted to stay open under stay-at-home orders. As some states have started lifting restrictions aimed to curb the spread of coronavirus, nonessential small businesses such as gyms, nail salons and tattoo parlors have been able to reopen, according to CNBC.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order in late April meant to reopen or keep meatpacking facilities open by designating them \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
