But this is an uncorroborated quote that has been floating around the internet for years.\n\n\"Starbucks CEO: \u2018If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don\u2019t Want Your Business,\" said a February 2017 headline from My Christian Daily, which circulated social media last week. My Christian Daily is a project from Initiate Media, a Christian media company that \"seek(s) to make God famous,\" according to its \"About\" page.\n\nSimilar stories have appeared on various websites since 2013. My Christian Daily cited an article from the Washington Press \u2014 a website that we were unable to find and may no longer exist \u2014 as well as an article from Forbes.\n\nFacebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe story about Schultz said that during a 2013 annual meeting for Starbucks shareholders, Schultz received a complaint from Tom Strobhar, founder of The Corporate Morality Action Center, an organization with a mission to \"challenge companies that offend traditional moral norms\" such as \"the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman.\"\n\nStrobhar said he believed Starbucks lost revenue because of its public support for a 2012 same-sex marriage referendum, which in turn inspired boycotts from anti-gay-marriage groups, such as the National Organization for Marriage. The referendum asked voters if same-sex marriage should be legalized in the state of Washington, and Starbucks joined other leading Washington-area companies in supporting the measure.\n\nIn response, the story went, Schultz told Strobhar to sell his Starbucks shares and invest in other companies.\n\nAs it turns out, Schultz\u2019s actual remarks were more nuanced, and we did not find any credible articles that quoted him saying he did not want business from opponents of same-sex marriage. Snopes debunked this falsehood years ago and updated its post on Sunday.\n\nSchultz said at the time that the decision to support same-sex marriage was about respecting diversity rather than maximizing revenue.\n\n\"Not every decision is an economic decision,\" Schultz said. \"Despite the fact that you recite statistics that are narrow in time, we did provide a 38 percent shareholder return over the last year. I don\u2019t know how many things you invest in, but I would suspect not many things, companies, products, investments have returned 38 percent over the last 12 months.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Having said that, it is not an economic decision to me. The lens in which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people. We employ over 200,000 people in this company, and we want to embrace diversity of all kinds. If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it\u2019s a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company.\"\n\nSchultz\u2019s 38 percent figure comes from fiscal year 2012, meaning the timeframe between October 2011 to September 2012. This return was down from the previous fiscal year, which saw a 46 percent shareholder return. (See a video of Schultz\u2019s full response.)\n\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015, Starbucks issued a statement applauding the decision and recalling Schultz\u2019s exchange with Strobhar as \"the company\u2019s most vocal statement on diversity and equality.\"\n\nReggie Borges, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said the My Christian Daily story is not accurate and pointed to the Snopes fact-check, a video of Schultz\u2019s response and the statement released after 2015 Supreme Court ruling as evidence.\n\nMy Christian Daily did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA headline stated, \"Starbucks CEO: \u2018If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don\u2019t Want Your Business.\u2019\"\n\nThis is a claim that has circulated since 2013. At an annual meeting for company shareholders, Strobhar said the company\u2019s support for same-sex marriage was eroding its bottom line, which prompted Schultz to defend his decision.\n\nSchultz said Strobhar was free to sell his Starbucks stocks and invest in another company if he believed the company\u2019s social policies meant he could get a better return on his money elsewhere. He did not say opponents of same-sex marriage were not wanted as investors or as customers.", "lang": "en"}
