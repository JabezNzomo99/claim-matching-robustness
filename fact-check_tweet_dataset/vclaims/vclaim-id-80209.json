Photos of the river during the previous administration show the claim is not true. An urban planning expert and a local resident also told AFP it had been dirty for many years.\n\nThe headline of the July 24 article in beritaterheboh.com reads: \u201cThis is the condition of Sentiong Black River during Ahok\u2019s era, pristinely clean and no disgusting smells\u201d.\n\nThe article has several photos that purportedly show a clean river during the tenure of former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as Ahok.\n\nAhok -- Jakarta\u2019s governor from 2014-2017 -- was jailed on blasphemy charges in 2017. His downfall was brought about by supporters of the current governor, Anies Baswedan.\n\nBaswedan\u2019s administration in July covered part of the river with black nylon nets in a bid to reduce the smell and hide its murky waters from the view of international athletes competing in the Asian Games in August. The river is located next to the athletes\u2019 village.\n\nOne of the groups that posted it is called Persatuan Rakyat Indonesia Pendukung Ahok (Union of Indonesian Ahok Supporters).\n\nThe beritaterheboh.com article has three photographs it claims show a \u201cclean and nice looking\u201d river. The photos are watermarked as belonging to Detik.com, a popular Indonesian news portal.\n\nIt also cites Detik for some of the information in its article, which has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook.\n\nThe images and some of the information from the article do appear in a Detik.com story on December 29, 2016.\n\nBut the article does not mention anything about the river being \u201cpristinely clean and not smelly\u201d during Ahok\u2019s administration.\n\nPhotos of the river during the time that Ahok was in power show that it was not in a pristine condition then.\n\nNews website liputan6.com published a series of photos in November 2015 showing the Sentiong River with black water and full of trash.\n\nPhotos published by another news organisation, Republika, in February 2015 show it in a similar condition -- murky and awash in garbage.\n\nNirwono Joga, an urban planning expert from Trisakti University in Jakarta, said none of the city\u2019s rivers had been clean since the 1950s due to poor waste management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because Jakarta, even now, does not separate sewage from the city\u2019s public waterways,\u201d Joga said.\n\nA local resident acknowledged that some of Ahok\u2019s clean-up policies helped to reduce the river\u2019s pungent smell and the amount of trash floating in its waters. But he said it was not clean during Ahok\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThe river was black like it is currently,\u201d Epen Rohimat, who has lived in a neighbourhood unit next to the river since 2011, told AFP.\n\n\u201cBut the smell (during Ahok\u2019s time) was not as bad as it had been in the past.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
