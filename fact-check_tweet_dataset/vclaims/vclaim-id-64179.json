Social media users soon started sharing an image that supposedly showed a message Bannon posted to Facebook. The message predicted members of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration would end up in federal prison by the end of Trump\u2019s first term:\n\nThis is not a genuine post from Bannon.\n\nThe meme image went viral possibly in part because the opposite of the \u201cprediction\u201d came true. In August 2020, as Trump\u2019s first term drew to a close, multiple members of his administration, not Obama\u2019s, had been charged with various crimes:\n\u2022 Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was convicted on charges related to tax and brank fraud.\n\u2022 Roger Stone, an adviser to the Trump campaign, was convicted of lying to Congress and obstructing the investigation into Russia\u2019s election meddling.\n\u2022 Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents during their Russia investigation.\n\u2022 Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a real estate deal in Moscow.\n\nBannon was charged with defrauding donors who contributed to a fundraising campaign to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. According to USA Today, at least seven people connected to the Trump campaign have faced various criminal charges.\n\nBut Bannon did not create the above-displayed meme.\n\nThe message was originally posted to a \u201cSteve Bannon\u201d Facebook page in March 2017, but it doesn\u2019t appear this page was officially connected to Bannon. The page has since been deleted, but archived versions show a few peculiar artifacts. For starters, the page was not verified. A number of contemporary comments on it also claimed it was not Bannon\u2019s real account. When the message above was posted in 2017 to the \u201cConservative Treehouse,\u201d a pro-Trump website, a number of commentators chimed in to say the Facebook account was fake.\n\nMost importantly, however, Bannon does have a genuine verified Facebook page. His official page is at the URL Facebook.com/SteveKBannon, not Facebook.com/Steve-Bannon, the URL of the impostor account.", "lang": "en"}
