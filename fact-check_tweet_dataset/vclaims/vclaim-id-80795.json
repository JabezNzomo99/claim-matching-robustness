(This comment starts at 20:30.)\n\nNRCC spokesman Zach Hunter said in an email that there was a difference between caucusing and endorsing, and that Rosen has generally been dodgy on the issue.\n\n\"In 2016 when you have such a divide in the Democratic party as it barrels towards a contested convention, the difference is significant,\" he said in an email.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Rosen has done few media interviews since announcing her candidacy, but it doesn\u2019t appear that she\u2019s really been asked about who she\u2019s endorsed for president.\n\nArticles in the and don\u2019t mention a presidential endorsement from Rosen.\n\nAssociated Press political reporter Michelle Rindels interviewed Rosen on April 27 for an upcoming story and confirmed that the candidate openly supported Clinton.\n\nIt is curious as to why Rosen didn\u2019t speak up about her presidential preference before Nevada\u2019s presidential caucus in February, despite announcing her candidacy back in January.\n\nThe Clinton campaign in the state didn\u2019t appear to tout her endorsement, and she doesn\u2019t appear on a campaign list of \" \" from November 2015.\n\nBut her endorsement of Clinton on Ralston Live was straightforward.\n\n\"She spent eight years in the White House, she was a senator, she\u2019s traveled all around the world talking to world leaders,\" she said. \"And she\u2019s a mom and a grandma and I really think she has a lifelong experience in doing this, having a calm, cool, collected head, being analytical and those are the kind of things that are important to me.\"\n\nThe NRCC says Democrat Jacky Rosen \"has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nPolitiFact was unable to find an instance where Rosen refused to answer questions about her presidential preference. Rosen has said on at least two occasions, one publicly and one to a reporter, that she supports Hillary Clinton.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
