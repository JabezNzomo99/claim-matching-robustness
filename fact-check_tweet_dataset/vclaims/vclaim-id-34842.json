A video floating across social media platforms is being shared with the claim that it depicts the calamity. Among those who circulated the video was chairman of RPG Group Harsh Goenka.\n\nSeveral others have shared the video that shows a massive plume of ash in the middle of water slowly engulfing the nearby areas.\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook.\n\nBreaking down the video into multiple frames using InVID and subsequently, reverse-searching individual images on Google, led us to an October 2017 report in UK-based media outlet Express. The report carried the same video currently viral.\n\nAccording to Express, the volcanic eruption was a video simulation \u2013 \u201cAn Australian geologist who was researching the risk of super-volcanoes in New Zealand had a team of producers create a video simulation of a huge volcanic eruption beneath the surface off the coast of Auckland, New Zealand, to show just how devastating they can be.\u201d\n\nLocal news organisation NZ Herald also reported on the research project.\n\nThe same video was found on YouTube using keywords \u201cundersea volcano in Auckland.\u201d It was uploaded by Auckland War Memorial Museum on October 12, 2017.\n\nVideos of the volcanic eruption in Mount Sinabung look contrastingly different from the imagery in the viral video, thus further proving that the clip shared on social media had nothing to do with the June 9 eruption.", "lang": "en"}
