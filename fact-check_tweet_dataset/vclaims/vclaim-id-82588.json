View an archived version of it here. It posted the same to its Facebook page (see the post below)\n\nKashmir Pen carried the story under the category 'International' on its website. It even states the source of the article as The Onion.\n\nThe Onion's piece also includes fictional and made up quotes of CIA director \n\nGina Haspel rendering an emotional apology to Bin Laden's family \n\nafter new evidence conclusively cleared the former Al Qaeda leader of any involvement whatsoever.
