The video is circulating as India observes complete lockdown, barring essential services, due to the coronavirus pandemic and China eases restricted movement owing to a decline in confirmed cases.\n\nThe video was shared by a Facebook page \u2018Narendra Modi fans from Karunadu\u2019 managed by fake news portal Postcard News. It is viral with the same claim on Facebook. The accompanying message reads, \u201cChinese priests sprinkling a mixture of cow urine mixed with cow dung and mango tree leaves from helicopters while chanting mantras. If it was in India, they will say that it is a superstition and will call them, Sanghi, cow dung eater and cow urine drinker.\u201d\n\nThe video is also viral with a Tamil text, \u201cUsing turmeric water and mango tree leaves in helicopters they are chanting vedic mantras and in China they are destroying corona.

We broke the video into individual frames and reverse searched one of them on Google with the keywords \u2018monks helicopter\u2019. We came across a blog \u2018Insight Myanmar\u2019 which carried a March 17, 2020, YouTube link by Shwe Lan Ga Lay where it was claimed that Burmese monks sprinkled water and chanted mantras in Myanmar in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, Alt News also came across an MSN article with the following editor\u2019s note: \u201cSeveral readers have suggested that the original video predates the coronavirus outbreak. We take the accuracy of our reporting seriously and are attempting to verify this at this time.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to Myanmar-based journalist Cape Diamond who shared with us a Facebook post from December 4, 2019. Upon further searching, we found the Facebook profile of the person who took the video and uploaded it on the social networking platform. This too was shared on December 4 and had no mention of coronavirus.\n\nWe also found the Facebook profile of one of the monks \u2013 the one on the extreme right highlighted in green. The other person highlighted in green, the one with a headset, is the person who shot the video. The video predates the coronavirus outbreak. Only in the first week of January 2020 did Chinese scientists report that the pneumonia-like cases cropping up in the country were due to a new strain of SARS-COV, termed the novel coronavirus. Myanmar confirmed its first coronavirus case on March 23, 2020. Therefore, an unrelated video of Burmese monks chanting religious verses and sprinkling holy water from a helicopter has been falsely shared as Chinese monks who poured cow urine to curb the viral infection. Note: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India is over 1,000 This has caused the government to impose a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services. Globally, more than 6 lakh confirmed cases and close to 31,000 deaths have been reported. There is a growing sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a global pandemic, can take lives. We request our readers to practice caution and not forward unverified messages on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.", "lang": "en"}
