The claim is false; UNESCO has denied making any such statement; the misleading story originated on a website which identifies itself as satirical.\n\n\n\nThe claim was made in this Facebook post on July 8, 2019, on a page based in the Philippines.\n\nThe post states the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) issued a certificate dated July 4, 2016 declaring Islam \u201cthe most peaceful religion of the world\u201d.\n\nThe post include an image of a purported \u201cCertificate of Peace\u201d with an apparent signature from UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the false Facebook post:\n\nThe post states in part: \u201cPARIS: In a major development that should silence critics of Islam who have been blaming it for terrorism, UNESCO has declared that Islam is the most peaceful religion of the world.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations body released a statement earlier today that revealed that UNESCO had partnered with International Peace Foundation six months back to study all religions of the world and find out which was most peaceful amongst all.\u201d\n\nA similar false claim received thousands of shares after being posted here on a Facebook account based in Nigeria; in a post here on a Facebook account based in India; and here on a Facebook account based in Sweden. It was also shared on Twitter here.\n\nSome of the posts include this link to an article on a satirical site named Junta Ka Reporter, which includes identical text to the misleading social media posts.\n\nThe claim in the social media posts is false; UNESCO has denied naming Islam \u201cthe most peaceful religion of the world\u201d.\n\nUNESCO issued this statement countering the false claim in the social media posts on July 11, 2016.\n\nIt states in part: \u201cWe wish to refer to the recent allegations posted on the website juntakareporter, citing an alleged statement and certificate from UNESCO declaring 'Islam as the most peaceful religion of the world'. Such statement was never made by the Organization and that the certificate reproduced on this website is a fake one. The website that published this information is a satirical media.\n\n\u201cUNESCO has never had any official relationship with the entity referred to as 'International Peace Foundation', nor has it ever supported such a statement or granted any diploma of this kind.\" \n\n\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the statement:\n\nAFP searched UNESCO\u2019s official website with keywords \u201cIslam is the most peaceful religion of the world\u201d and the top result was UNESCO\u2019s denial above. No search results showed such statement.\n\nJunta Ka Reporter has a disclaimer on its website here which states its content is satirical.\n\nThe disclaimer says: \u201cYou seriously believe this shit is real? Before you sue us, do a favor to your intelligence and realize that it is a satire website. Everything published here is made up. But if you are still that stupid and hurt, we are sorry\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the site\u2019s disclaimer:", "lang": "en"}
