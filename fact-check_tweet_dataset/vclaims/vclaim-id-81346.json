The FBI record of Davis contains what is purported to be his Communist Party identification number: #47544. (The number was obtained from a \u201chighly confidential source,\u201d the files show.) The House Committee on Un-American Activities was well aware of Davis by the late 1940s. Davis\u2019s last identification as a Communist Party member was in 1952, and he stopped being active with the Hawaii Civil Rights Congress in 1956, the file says. When Davis took the Fifth Amendment in front of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in 1956, agents were suspicious.\n\nWhy do Kincaid and others believe that the relationship with Davis shaped Obama more than, say, his own experiences and others he met throughout his life? Why does it matter that he met Davis as a teen? It\u2019s that Davis was a \u201chard-core member\u201d of the Communist Party and hated America and instilled those thoughts in Obama, Kincaid said. Obama also has gone on to surround himself with others with radical left views, Kincaid said.\n\nThe Facts: The Case For Davis", "lang": "en"}
