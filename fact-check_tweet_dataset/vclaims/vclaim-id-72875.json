I don\u2019t want it to be printed in the paper, but it\u2019s racially insensitive. It is a tradition that was used to celebrate the hanging of black folks back in the days, so just, we need to change it to \u2018family outing, cookout, barbecue,\u2019 but I would never use that word.\"\n\nWe wanted to know if McKinzie\u2019s point was accurate, so we interviewed professors of language and African-American history.\n\nThey said it does not refer to lynchings.\n\nInstead, picnic has French roots and refers to a social gathering where people eat. (Snopes long ago debunked a similar claim.)\n\nMcKinzie, a Democrat and owner of a general contracting firm, was appointed by the commission to fill a vacancy in 2014 and has since won election twice. He represents a district that includes most of the city\u2019s historically black neighborhoods.\n\nWe asked McKinzie and his assistant to provide evidence to support his claim and did not get a response by our deadline.\n\nClaims have circulated for at least two decades that the word \"picnic\" has racist connotations.\n\nIn 2002, Yohuru R. Williams, then an associate professor of history at Delaware State University, wrote an article for the Black History Bulletin, \"Anatomy of an untruth: the controversy over 'picnic\u2019 and the true cause of lynching.\"\n\nWilliams wrote the article a couple years after he heard a presentation by Ron Wallace, president of Dularon Entertainment. Wallace said the word picnic was short for \"pick a n-----' to lynch.\"\n\nWe found the same statement by Wallace in the Oakland Post in 1997.\n\nBut Williams, who is now a dean at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul told us that \"picnic\" is not a racially insensitive term.\n\nHowever, McKinzie would have been on more solid ground if he had said that many lynchings had a picnic-like atmosphere.\n\nThe term historians use is \"spectacle lynchings,\" Williams said. These were large public gatherings where people took photographs and looked for souvenirs, he said.\n\nOther writers and experts have also debunked the idea that the word picnic has racist origins, including David Pilgrim, founder and curator of the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University in Michigan.\n\nPilgrim told us in an interview that it\u2019s possible someone used the word picnic to refer to lynchings, but \"what we know for a fact is that\u2019s not where the word picnic came from.\"\n\nOther historians have also documented the picnic-like atmosphere of lynchings.\n\nPhilip Dray, who wrote a book, At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America, wrote that crowds consumed food or drink.\n\n\"Lynching was an undeniable part of daily life, as distinctly American as baseball games and church suppers,\" he wrote. \"Men brought their wives and children to the events, posed for commemorative photographs, and purchased souvenirs of the occasion as if they had been at a company picnic.\"\n\nUniversity of North Carolina history professor W. Fitzhugh Brundage told us that the term \"negro barbecue\" was used to describe instances in which whites burned their victims.\n\n\"Such extreme mutilation happened in fewer than a quarter of the lynchings, but of course the horror of the events and the publicity surrounding them meant that they left a lasting impression,\" Brundage said. \"So if someone has a problem with words associated with lynching, it should arguably be barbecue and not picnic.\"\n\nJoseph T. Acquisto, professor of French who chairs the department of romance languages and linguistics at the University of Vermont, said the word picnic has French origins. It is a composite of two French words: the verb piquer and the noun nique (pronounced: pea-kay and neek).\n\nAcquisto said the term dates back to 1694, according to the Tr\u00e9sor de la langue fran\u00e7aise, an extensive dictionary of 19th and 20th century French.\n\n\"It notes that the original meaning was a meal where everyone paid their share or brought their own food, and then later became an outdoor meal,\" he said.\n\nKevin Rottet, an associate professor of French linguistics at Indiana University, told us that the first appearance of the word picnic in English was in 1748.\n\n\"From a linguistic point of view, the accusation of racial insensitivity does not at all accord with the facts in the history of this word,\" Rottet said. \"I would categorically reject the claim of racist connotations here.\"\n\nMcKinzie said that the word picnic is a \"racially insensitive word.\"\n\nThere is no evidence that the origin of the word traces back to lynchings of African-Americans. The word has French origins and refers to a gathering with food.\n\nDuring lynchings, the settings were sometimes social occasions where white people ate food. While that was a picnic-like atmosphere, it doesn\u2019t mean that the word \"picnic\" is a racist word.", "lang": "en"}
