Andrew M. Cuomo touts New York state as a progressive beacon for the rest of the country.\n\nBut his primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, says that\u2019s not true when it comes to recreational marijuana. It\u2019s not legal in New York state.\n\nCuomo was asked about the issue during a recent exchange with reporters on Long Island.\n\n\"Given what\u2019s happened in Massachusetts, California, what could happen in New Jersey, do you feel as if New York is behind on this at all?\" NY1 Reporter Zack Fink asked Cuomo.\n\n\"No, I think we\u2019re actually ahead on it,\" Cuomo said. \"We announced months ago that we were going to study the legalization issue precisely for that reason. You have Massachusetts, you have New Jersey talking about it.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Cuomo asked the state Department of Health to study what legalizing marijuana would mean for New York state. The study will reportedly be finished this fall.\n\nSome states have already legalized marijuana for recreational use. So, what was Cuomo talking about when he said \"we\u2019re actually ahead on it?\"\n\nWhat Cuomo was saying\n\nCuomo did not mean to say New York state was ahead of other states that already legalized recreational marijuana, a spokesperson said. He meant that the Department of Health study would put New York state ahead of others in responding to the federal government's new position on state marijuana laws.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama-era rule earlier this year that allowed states to legalize marijuana without federal interference. States with legal marijuana have mostly shrugged off the decision.\n\nContext matters here. A reporter asked Cuomo if New York state was falling behind states that already legalized recreational marijuana. Cuomo said New York state was not, and his full response makes little mention of the federal position.\n\nNine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana.\n\nThe state legislature in Vermont recently voted to make recreational marijuana legal later this year. The other states legalized recreational use through ballot referendums.\n\nNew Jersey and Michigan may be next. New Jersedy Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, supports legalization and wants lawmakers to approve a bill this year. Advocates in Michigan have gathered enough signatures to put legalization on the ballot in November.\n\nColorado was the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use in 2012.\n\nNew York state, however, is taking steps toward legalization that other states have not. The study from the state Department of Health leaves the option for legalization on the table.\n\nCuomo has been opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana. He has called it a \"gateway drug.\"\n\nBut he supports decriminalizing marijuana -- ending criminal penalties for possessing and using small amounts of the drug. Selling it would still carry a penalty.\n\nNew York state legalized marijuana for medicinal use in 2014. The state\u2019s program has expanded since its inception, allowing more conditions to be treated with the drug and wider access statewide.\n\nCuomo said New York state is ahead of other states on legalizing marijuana for recreational use.\n\nThat\u2019s not true. Nine other states have already legalized recreational marijuana. Other states have also taken steps toward legalization that New York state has not. New Jersey\u2019s governor has called on the legislature to legalize the drug, while voters in Michigan are expected to decide on legalization later this year.", "lang": "en"}
