The BBC said more correctly that government is introducing legislation to parliament, but introducing it is not a guarantee it will eventually come into effect.\n\nAny new legislation needs to be debated by both MPs and Lords, reviewed by committees and passed by parliament before it becomes law and takes effect.\n\nWhat the government is technically doing today is telling parliament it intends to legislate to change some workers\u2019 rights. So far as we\u2019ve been able to determine the draft legal texts haven\u2019t yet been published or presented to parliament.", "lang": "en"}
