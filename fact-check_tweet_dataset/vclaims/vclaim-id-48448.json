Her wearing sindoor (vermilion) after marriage and visiting pandals during Durga Puja have generated a lot of talk on social media.\n\nClick here for an archive link of the post.\n\nThe video has also been retweeted by former member of parliament of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) actor Paresh Rawal, who identified the performer as Jahan.\n\nThe original tweet that Rawal had retweeted has now been deleted. The video was earlier debunked by ALT News.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the woman in the performance is not Nusrat Jahan. We looked up with relevant keywords on YouTube and came across the same video that was uploaded to YouTube on October 6, this year.\n\nThe woman in the performance has been identified as Rashmi Mishra. Mishra performed at the Powai Bengali Welfare Association Times Durga Puja, 2019, one of the most popular Durga Pujas of Mumbai.\n\nThe same video has been uploaded by the PBWA\u2019s official Facebook page as well.\n\nMeanwhile, another video of Bengali actress Ritabhari Chakraborty performing a dhunuchi naach at one of Kolkata\u2019s popular Durga Puja pandals has been doing the rounds with a similar narrative.\n\nMultiple videos of Chakraborty dancing at a South Kolkata puja pandal has been captioned as Nusrat Jahan\u2019s performance. Chakraborty had also uploaded footage of her performance on her Instagram page.", "lang": "en"}
