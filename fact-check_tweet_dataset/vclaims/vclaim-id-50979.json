They have begun evicting people from their homes. The media doesn't show it, they are being sold, so it is our responsibility now to share this video.\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be false. The video is five months old and from Rajasthan during an anti-encroachment drive by Jaipur Development Authority (JDA).\n\nTill the time of filing this story, Denzil Brown's post was viewed more than 9,500 times and shared over 350 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nAFWA could not find any credible news report related to the video but the arm badges of policemen are clearly visible, which helped us ascertain that they are Rajasthan police.\n\nUsing a combination of reverse search and related keywords, we found a tweet by user \"Bharat Prabhat Party\" who posted the same video and said it is from Kanota village in Jaipur where police are demolishing the houses of Dalits, poor and tribal people. The user tweeted the video on August 7, 2019.\n\nFurther investigation took us to a YouTube channel called \"ZERO NEWS\" where other videos of the incident are available. The details of these videos also say that the incident took place in Kanota village of Jaipur where policemen destroyed one part of a house without prior JDA notice.\n\nTo verify the incident, we reached out to Kanota police station where an officer confirmed that the viral video is from an anti-encroachment drive by JDA in the village. He said the drive took place in August last year and has nothing to do with NRC.\n\nWith the help of Kanota police station, AFWA contacted inspector Rajiv Yaduvanshi, who was part of the drive and is also seen in the video. Yaduvanshi told us, \"Some people had encroached the common way and built a wall on it. We demolished the wall after which a scuffle broke out between police and the encroachers.\"\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the video of an anti-encroachment drive in Jaipur is being shared as people being evicted from their houses in Assam after NRC.", "lang": "en"}
