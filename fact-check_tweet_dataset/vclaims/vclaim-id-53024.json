{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did A Black Lives Matter Flyer Call White People \u2018The Enemy\u2019?", "subtitle": "", "author": "checkyourfact.com", "date": "2020-06-28T19:47:43.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-53024", "url": "http://checkyourfact.com/2020/06/28/fact-check-black-lives-matter-flyer-white-people-enemy/", "vclaim": "The flyer appears to be fabricated. A representative of Black Lives Matter denied the flyer came from the organization.\n\nBlack Lives Matter protests erupted across the U.S. after George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in Minneapolis police custody on May 25 according to BBC News.\n\nOne image shared on Facebook claims to show a flyer from Black Lives Matter reading, \u201cAttention White men women and children. You are the enemy!\u201d The flyer goes on to claim that the organization \u201cwill not stop until there are more white homicides then (sic) black\u201d and that all white people must be sent to \u201cre-education camps.\u201d\n\nBut the flyer is inconsistent with the values the Black Lives Matter movement describes on its website. There is no mention of white people being considered an enemy of the group, rather Black Lives Matter says it fights for justice for all people.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge, respect, and celebrate differences and commonalities,\u201d the movement\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe work vigorously for freedom and justice for Black people and, by extension, all people.\u201d\n\nNor does the website mention sending white people to \u201cre-education\u201d camps or any of the flyer\u2019s other claims.

The Evening Telegram reported June 12 that a fake Black Lives Matter flyer found in Dundee, Scotland, called for white people to be killed.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
