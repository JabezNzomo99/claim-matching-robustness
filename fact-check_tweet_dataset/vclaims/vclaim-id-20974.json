It is a reference to the St. Georges Ribbon, the orange and black striped emblem of Russian nationalists, which is also the coloring pattern of the Colorado beetle, one of the worst potato pests in the world.\n\nTymchuk notes that the poster was shared on June 28 by Granatkin in a discussion on Facebook. Three days later, it was posted by blogger Vladimir Khengistov, who asked his friends who the original artist was.\n\nIt was from here that the image spread, Tymchuk writes, as it was picked up by Ukraine\u2019s Vesti, which claimed that it was unknown who was behind the image while noting that one of the organizations whose branding appeared on the poster, M17, had denied any involvement in the production.\n\nVesti\u2019s report was cited by RIA Novosti, which added the claim, absent from the former, that the poster was being put up on Kyiv\u2019s streets, as also stated by the Russian embassy in London.\n\nSupposed \u2018linguistic genocide\u2019 is a favorite for Russian fakes.In April 2015, Rossiya-1 claimed that Ukraine\u2019s President Petro Poroshenko had stated in a major address that\u201cwe will always speak only Ukrainian\u201dHe had said only that Ukrainian would continue to be the only state language, but that was not good enough for the Russian channel which claimed: \u201cPoroshenko today stated that the Ukrainian language would always be the only State language despite the fact that the special status of Donbas agreed in Minsk by the \u2018Normandy Four\u2019 envisages that they will be able to speak Russian freely as well\u201d.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this is not the first time Russian media have spread false reports of frightening poster campaigns in Ukraine.\n\nIn April, 2014, the BBC reported that the head of Russia\u2019s pro-Kremlin Life News television channel had shared a doctored photo depicting a photo of Adolf Hitler hung up as a banner outside Kyiv City Council.", "lang": "en"}
