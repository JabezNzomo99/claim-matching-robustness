IT IS VERY REAL AND VERY DEADLY\u201d and \u201cAUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS BLOW THE WHISTLE ON THIS US GOVERNMENT-FUNDED BIOWEAPON\u201d.\n\nThe July 18 post has been viewed more than 519,000 times, shared more than 29,000 times and attracted 3800 comments.\n\nThe video in the post claims Australian scientists found COVID-19 was \u201chuman made\u201d and that they blew the whistle on \u201cthis US government-funded bioweapon\u201d. The video uses edited parts of a interview with Australian scientist Professor Nikolai Petrovsky on Sky News Australia and Prof Petrovsky has told AAP FactCheck the post is \u201ccompletely misleading\u201d and \u201ca distortion\u201d.\n\nThe video was published on June 16 by a website called Truth In Media. The video titled, \u2018Multiple Scientists: Coronavirus was Lab Altered to Better Attach To Human Cells\u2019, includes excerpts from a May 24 interview on Australia\u2019s Sky News with Prof Petrovsky from South Australia\u2019s Flinders University. Prof Petrovsky was interviewed about the findings of a study into the origins of COVID-19 he conducted with researchers at Victoria\u2019s La Trobe University.\n\nThe video makes several claims about Prof Petrovsky\u2019s May 2020 research, which looked into the origins of COVID-19 using computer modelling to better understand the transmission of the virus in a bid to find a vaccine.\n\nThe video begins with host Ben Swann saying: \u201cA brand new study out of Australia by a team of scientists claims that the coronavirus is in fact human-made and did not occur naturally in nature as we have been told so many times over the past few months\u201d.\n\nIn an emailed response to AAP FactCheck, Prof Petrovsky rejected Mr Swann\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cAll we said was that the virus had surprising features that were hard to explain, particularly it being perfectly adapted to human spread from the very first isolates,\u201d the professor said.\n\n\u201cI clearly said we do not yet know the origins of the virus, which may have come from animals as has been the case in the past, but the possibility of a laboratory leak of a lab created virus also cannot be excluded without proper investigation.\u201d\n\nProf Petrovsky said the post\u2019s headline, \u201cAUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS BLOW THE WHISTLE ON THIS US GOVERNMENT-FUNDED BIOWEAPON\u201d was \u201ccompletely false\u201d.\n\n\u201cI said nothing about bioweapons, where it could have been created etc as implied by this headline,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the video at 1min 28sec, Mr Swann says five Australian scientists working on a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cfound some very strange things\u201d while studying the pathogen. He said the scientists believe \u201cthere is almost no way that COVID-19 originated in nature\u201d. He then claims: \u201cInstead, they say, it\u2019s almost impossible that it\u2019s not human-made.\u201d\n\nProf Petrovsky told AAP FactCheck: \u201cAs authors we did not say this.\u201d\n\nAt 2min, 19sec, Mr Swann says: \u201cNikolai Petrovsky, the lead researcher, said his team suspects human manipulation in Wuhan because of the unmatched ability of the virus\u2019s protruding spike to infect human cells. The virus\u2019s binding strength for human cells \u2018far exceeds\u2019 similar properties for infecting other animals, he said in a statement on the forthcoming report.\u201d The post\u2019s video includes excerpts of an interview with Prof Petrovsky on Sky News on May 24.\n\nOn Mr Swann\u2019s statement, Prof Petrovsky told AAP FactCheck the second part of the statement, regarding the binding strength of the virus, was accurate \u201cbut the introduction is incorrect \u2013 I avoided saying I had any reason to believe the virus was man made \u2013 simply saying this possibility could not be excluded based on current information.\u201d\n\nIn the Sky News interview (3min 26sec), Prof Petrovsky said: \u201cWe really don\u2019t know where this virus has come from\u2026 that\u2019s the truth\u2026 The two possibilities, which I think are both still open, are firstly that it was a chance transmission of a virus from an as yet unidentified animal to humans. The other possibility of course is that it was an accidental release of the virus from a laboratory.\u201d\n\nProf Petrovsky said his quotes, findings and opinions were correctly presented in the Sky News interview with Sharri Markson. Asked about the context in which the interview excerpts were used in the post, Prof Petrovsky told AAP FactCheck: \u201cThis post is completely misleading and a distortion of our paper and what I was saying in the interview.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. Professor Nikolai Petrovsky told AAP FactCheck the origins of COVID-19 were not yet known. Neither he nor any other Australian scientist is quoted or shown in the post\u2019s video referring to COVID-19 as a \u201cUS GOVERNMENT-FUNDED BIOWEAPON\u201d. Prof Petrovsky said the headline was \u201ccompletely false\u201d. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate or misleading. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
