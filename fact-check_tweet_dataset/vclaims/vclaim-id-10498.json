No, that's not true. The claim was made by a website that habitually takes some real news and then adds a few paragraphs and an inflammatory headline to make it sound much, much worse than what is really going on in order to get people to click and share the article on social media.\n\nThe misleading story was published as an article on April 20, 2018 by YourNewsWire under the headline \"California Gov. Jerry Brown To Ban Sales Of The Bible\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSales of the Holy Bible and Biblical based teaching is set to be banned in California in the near future thanks to Governor Jerry Brown and the state assembly who have combined to force a bill through the state assembly that claims the Bible promotes hate speech against gays, lesbians and transgender people. Assembly Bill 2943 will threaten the freedom of religion and First Amendment rights of Christians in California. Using the state's \"consumer fraud statute\" to restrict religious freedom and free speech, the bill seeks to ban sales of the Bible because it includes verses that fall outside what Gov. Brown considers \"acceptable teaching\" on sexuality issues. The controversial bill, which will also ban any form of speech or written material that promotes traditional Christian views on marriage and sexuality, has already made its way through the California state assembly after it was approved on the floor Thursday. The bill now goes to the state Senate for a vote.\n\nIn reality Assembly Bill 2943 is not an order from the Governor but an initiative from California Assembly Member Evan Low that still has to be voted on before it becomes law. It also doesn't ban the bible (or any religious books). The full text of the bill doesn't even mention the words \"bible\", \"book\" or \"text\" at all.\n\nUPDATE: The bill passed in the California Assembly in 2018 but failed to be voted on in the Senate, it is currently listed as \"Died\" on the website of the California legisture after being inactive for too long.\n\nThe relevant parts of the bill are these lines:\n\nSelling bibles does not fall under this prohibition and nor would the sale of texts generally disapproving or criticizing homosexuality. It would ban advertisting for such books, therapies etc. if it was done with the explicitly stated goal of changing people's sexual orientation (i.e. gay conversion therapy etc.).\n\nA bible ban would go directly against the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and would be struck down in a heartbeat by the Supreme Court.\n\nBut this bill doesn't limit anyone's free speech: people would still be able to say a certain sexual orientation is sinful or goes against religious teachings or should be considered immoral etc. Strictly reading this bill people would still be allowed to publish tips or methods to change one's sexual orientation as long as it would not result in \"the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer\".\n\nConfusion around the purpose of the bill seems to have mainly originated from a television interview with conservative politician Travis Allen that misrepresented the consequences of this bill by claiming it would ban the bible:\n\nSnopes already pointed out the many inaccuracies in that interview:\n\nThat makes the summary of the YourNewsWire article visible on social media completely inaccurate:\n\nGovernor Brown is not involved, the bible is not even mentioned in the bill and the phrase \"acceptable teaching\" is also not present anywhere in the text.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Top UN Inspector Did NOT Say Assad Not Responsible For Chemical Weapons Attack\n\u2022 Fake News: Queen Elizabeth Did NOT Say Imminent War Being Planned By Powerful Forces\n\u2022 Fake News: CDC Doctor Found Floating In River Did NOT Expose Flu Shot\n\u2022 Reporter Baxter Dimitri Kidnapped By Russian Deep State Aliens On Orders From Pope Francis", "lang": "en"}
