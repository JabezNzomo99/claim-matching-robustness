Along with pictures of Dhruv Saxena with CM Shiv Singh Chouhan and BJP National General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, we also posted a screenshot of the cached version of BJYM Bhopal\u2019s district body where his position in BJYM Bhopal could be clearly seen. The reason why we posted a screenshot of the cached version of the website was because the bjymbhopal.org website was down yesterday and hence we had to use Google\u2019s cache to retrieve the website. As it turns out, bjymbhopal.org website is up again and Dhruv Saxena is nowhere to be seen in the list of office bearers.\n\nHowever, Internet is such a place where deleting one\u2019s footmarks is almost impossible. A website called \u201cInternet Archive: Wayback Machine\u201d keeps multiple cached copies of almost all the websites with date wise snapshots. We retrieved a snapshot of BJYM Bhopal\u2019s website as on 12th October 2016, where it can be clearly seen that Dhruv Saxena is the District Coordinator of their IT Cell. A screenshot of the same can be seen below:\n\nIt can also be seen in the credit section at the bottom of the website that the BJYM website itself was designed and developed by Vocal Heart Infotech of which Dhruv Saxena is the Managing Director. This information has also been removed from the website and they have replaced Dhruv Saxena in the website with someone else. Here\u2019s what the District Body of BJYM Bhopal looks like now.\n\nMeanwhile, BJP has distanced itself from Dhruv Saxena stating he was never part of BJP.", "lang": "en"}
