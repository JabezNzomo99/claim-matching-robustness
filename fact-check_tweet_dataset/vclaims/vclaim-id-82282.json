(Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice said they did not use a personal e-mail account; Colin Powell said he did but did not retain records.)\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Clinton provide her emails to the State Department until December 2014? In 2014, after recognizing potential gaps in its overall recordkeeping system, the State Department asked for the help of the four previous former Secretaries in meeting the State Department\u2019s obligations under the Federal Records Act. Clinton responded to this request by providing the State Department with over 55,000 pages of emails. As it was Clinton\u2019s practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts, the overwhelming majority of these emails should have already been preserved in the State Department\u2019s email system. In providing these emails to the Department, Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-related\u2014including emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meeting\u2014erring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the Department and National Archives\u2019 determination that over 1250 emails were \u201cpersonal\u201d records (which they have indicated will be returned to her). After providing her work and potentially work-related emails, she chose not to keep her personal, non-work related emails, which by definition, are not federal records and were not requested by the Department or anyone else. Why did the State Department ask for assistance in collecting records? Why did the State Department need assistance in further meeting its requirements under the Federal Records Act? The State Department formally requested the assistance of the four previous former Secretaries in a letter to their representatives dated October 28, 2014, to help in further meeting the Department\u2019s requirements under the Federal Records Act. The letter stated that in September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued new guidance clarifying records management responsibilities regarding the use of personal email accounts for government business. While this guidance was issued after all four former Secretaries had departed office, the Department decided to ensure its records were as complete as possible and sought copies of work emails sent or received by the Secretaries on their own accounts.", "lang": "en"}
