Then, of that 400,000 or so, 70 percent will become trafficking victims \u2014 most within 72 hours. Do the math, and that\u2019s supposedly nearly 300,000 runaways a year trapped in the sex trade.\n\nBut there are huge problems with the 800,000 figure in the first place. While it is mentioned in a document on the NCMEC Web site, the organization notes that it is old data from 1999, derived from the National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway and Thrownaway Children (NISMART), a random-sample survey released by an arm of the Justice Department. As we have noted before, this same study is frequently misused for the misleading claim that 58,000 children a year are \u201cabducted.\u201d (The number of stereotypical kidnappings listed in the report is actually 115.)\n\nDavid Finkelhor, a University of New Hampshire professor who is director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center and a key author of the study, said that the Defiance College news release glommed together a number of unrelated statistics from different studies to reach an unwarranted conclusion. \u201cAn extremely small percentage of runaways end up homeless,\u201d he said, instead of the 50-percent figure in the college\u2019s news release.\n\nThe 800,000 figure in the NISMART survey refers to cases where parents reported children were missing to either the police or a missing children\u2019s agency. (All told, the report said, 1.3 million children were reported missing by their caretakers or were missed by the caretaker for at least an hour but no report was filed). But 99.8 percent of the kids were recovered. That left only a total of 2,500 (0.2 percent) children who did not return home or had not been located; most were runaways from institutions.\n\nOn top of that, Finkelhor said that runaway population has declined significantly the past 20 years, in part because of cell phones and computers. \u201cKids have a longer lease these days,\u201d he said, \u201cKids also have more stuff to do around the home. If they leave, they lose access to their toys.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to remember that the Federal Trafficking Victims Act of 2000 set age 18 as a dividing line for the sale of sex, no matter the age of consent in a state, so any runaway under the age of 18 who trades sex for shelter or food is by definition \u201ctrafficked,\u201d even if no pimp is involved. A 2011 study funded by the National Institute of Justice found that nearly 90 percent of sex workers in Atlantic City under the age of 18 reported they had no pimp.\n\nDeep in its Web site, NCMEC suggests that this number refers to cases reported to the organization itself. \u201cIt is not from empirical research,\u201d Shehan acknowledged. \u201cIt is literally a trend that we see, but you could not extrapolate to say this is a nationwide statistic.\u201d (The 1 in 6 figure was rounded up from 1 in 5.6, since it would seem odd to have a partial child.)\n\nFor 2014, NCMEC received a little over 10,000 reports. (In 2013, NCMEC received just under 9,000.) So that means that about 1,800 children in 2014 were reported to have some link to sex trafficking based on certain criteria \u2014 an arrest of a pimp, a caregiver\u2019s report that the child was involved in the sex trade or because the runaway was under 18 and exchanged sex for food, money or shelter. The numbers may have gone up because of better reporting rather than more cases, she said.\n\nThis is yet another cautionary tale about the misuse of statistics. As an academic institution, Defiance College should not be so sloppy in cobbling together outdated and dubious \u201cfacts,\u201d even in service of a potentially worthwhile endeavor. While the news release gave the impression of hundreds of thousands of sex trafficking victims, the actual number appear to be substantially smaller.\n\nThe Four Pinocchios are for the college, but at the same time NCMEC also needs to be more transparent about the source of its data \u2014 and its limitations. The organization needs to clearly explain that the \u201c1 in 6\u201d figure is not a nationwide statistic and merely reflects cases directly reported to NCMEC. (Update: To its credit, NCMEC made this recommended change.) The organization also needs to more thoroughly scrub its Web site of outdated statistics, or else the mistakes made by Defiance College will be replicated by others.", "lang": "en"}
