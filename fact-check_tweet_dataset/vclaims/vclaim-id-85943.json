Under the Joint Plan of Action, IAEA inspectors will have daily access to Fordow. On days when inspectors would not otherwise be present to carry out standard inspections under Iran\u2019s Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA, inspectors will have access to Fordow in order to review camera surveillance records. With daily access, the IAEA would quickly detect the beginning of any move by Iran to break out of the NPT and rapidly produce at Fordow highly enriched uranium for weapons. Similarly, prior to the Joint Plan of Action, the IAEA conducted inspections at Natanz approximately once every two weeks, where they monitor numbers of centrifuges installed and their operational status; enrichment activities; inventory of material fed into centrifuges and the enriched uranium produced; and research and development activities at the pilot plant. Under the Joint Plan of Action, IAEA inspectors will have daily access to Natanz. On days when inspectors would not otherwise be present to carry out standard inspections, inspectors will have access to Natanz in order to review camera surveillance records. With daily access, the IAEA would quickly detect the beginning of any breakout at Natanz. At the Arak reactor, the IAEA currently conducts inspections every three months. Under the Joint Plan of Action, as part of verification of Iran\u2019s commitments not to commission the Arak reactor, not to transfer fuel or heavy water to the site, and not to install remaining components, the IAEA will have access to Arak once a month. Inspectors would observe whether or not fuel or heavy water had been transferred to the site, or components installed, and issue periodic reports on Iran\u2019s fulfillment of its commitments based on the results of the inspections. At the plant in Esfahan where fuel for the Arak reactor is produced, prior to the Joint Plan of Action the IAEA currently conducts inspections every three months. As part of verification of Iran\u2019s commitments not to produce fuel for the Arak reactor and in order to provide reports to the Joint Commission, the IAEA will have access once a month. Inspectors would observe the lines where fuel for the Arak reactor is produced, and issue periodic reports on Iran\u2019s fulfillment of its commitments based on the results of the inspections. Under the Joint Plan of Action, the IAEA is also granted new types of access to Iran\u2019s uranium mines and mills and to its centrifuge storage, rotor production, and assembly facilities. Finally, the IAEA has stated that it is planning to roughly double the size of its inspection team and install additional monitoring equipment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no need on those days to have daily access to any of the facilities,\u201d he added. \u201cThe language in the JPA says that the IAEA has daily access to surveillance records. This does not mean that the IAEA can see what happens actually at the enrichment cascade areas or elsewhere at the facility. The surveillance is designed to detect unreported removal of nuclear material from the cascade areas. This is a standard practice in all enrichment facilities and should also be valid to Iran unless the IAEA has negotiated entirely new arrangements.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe access rights of the IAEA [today] are better than in last two three years after the implementation of the 2007 Work Plan came to halt in September 2008,\u201d Heinonen concluded. \u201cHowever, the IAEA had much more rights in 2003-2005 when Iran agreed with the E.U.-3 to suspend its uranium enrichment and heavy water reactor and reprocessing-related activities and provide a complete picture on its past nuclear program. On those days we were able \u2014 albeit with difficulties \u2014 to visit some military installations suspected of being part of the nuclear program: Kohladouz, Lavisan with some associated location, and twice the famous Parchin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have inspections that are good enough to determine if they have a secret centrifuge plant.\u201d He said the ability to determine whether Iran can make a bomb, such as learning how much raw material Iran has used or how many centrifuge rotors have been made, is yet to be negotiated. The current inspections, he said, only help determine whether Iran is not breaking out to make a bomb at these particular declared sites.\n\nLewis said that \u201cit\u2019s just too hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison to the relatively modest program back in the 2003-2005 period. There are now two parallel tracks, one with the P5+1 [diplospeak for the six world powers] and the other with the IAEA. The IAEA process is formally separate from the Joint Plan of Action, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves about how the IAEA got access. Moreover, what may matter is not the IAEA\u2019s formal access, but what it gets in practice.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
