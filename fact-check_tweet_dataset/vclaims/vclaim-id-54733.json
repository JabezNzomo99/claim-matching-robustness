This particular post alleges Trump announced a 30-day nationwide motorcycle ban that includes penalties for violators starting April 8.\n\n\u201cTrump announced today, all motorcycle transportation is suspended!\u201d claims the post. \u201cIf caught out on the road your bikes will be impounded, and a 500 dollar fine in any state for the next 30 days. It could be continued depending on the virus results.\u201d\n\nThe federal government has issued guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus in the U.S., including following the directions of state and local authorities. Many states have instituted stay-at-home orders that limit travel to only essential purposes such as buying groceries or seeking medical treatment.\n\nThere is no record of Trump instituting a 30-day motorcycle ban. The Daily Caller reviewed April 8\u2019s press briefing transcript and found no mention of policies aimed at restricting forms of personal transportation. Nor has Trump announced such a move at any other White House coronavirus task force briefings to date.\n\nHad Trump done so, the ban would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it, and the Department of Transportation did not issue a press release.
