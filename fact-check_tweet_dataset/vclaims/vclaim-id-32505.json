Bernie Sanders has said \u201cscientists tell us\u201d that it\u2019s possible to go carbon neutral without relying on nuclear power, fellow Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker, who backs the use of some nuclear energy, has said the data is on his side. Who\u2019s right? Both have a point, but neither is telling the full story.\n\nMost experts agree that Sanders is correct that it\u2019s technologically possible to decarbonize the grid without using nuclear power. But many researchers also say keeping nuclear on the table makes decarbonization easier and more likely.\n\nSanders, a three-term senator from Vermont, has proposed banning new nuclear power plants and placing a moratorium on existing nuclear power plant license renewals, all while reaching 100% renewable energy by 2030 and \u201ccomplete decarbonization\u201d by 2050. Currently, 17% of electricity in the U.S. comes from renewables, including 6.5% from wind, 1.5% from solar and 7% from hydropower.\n\nBooker, a New Jersey senator and a former mayor of Newark, has called for reaching \u201c100% clean energy\u201d in the electricity sector by 2030. His plan includes a $20 billion investment in next-generation advanced nuclear research and development by the end of the next decade.\n\nDuring power generation, nuclear plants release no greenhouse gases, but they come with additional safety, security and waste disposal challenges.\n\nHe Said, He Said\n\nThe candidates\u2019 divide on nuclear power became apparent on Sept. 4 during CNN\u2019s climate crisis town hall, a two-day event in which the 10 leading Democratic presidential hopefuls were quizzed about their approaches to tackling climate change.\n\nAfter Sanders was asked about his position on nuclear power by a graduate student in the audience, CNN\u2019s chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir, followed up, pointing out that the U.S. gets 20% of its electricity from nuclear, and France gets about 70%. Referencing the amount of land required for solar and wind, Weir asked how it would be possible to go \u201ccarbon neutral without nuclear in the short term.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you can,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cAnd I think the scientists tell us, in fact, that we can.\u201d He went on to mention the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 and 1986\u2019s Chernobyl disaster.\n\nBooker, meanwhile, made his counterclaim hours later. \u201c[N]uclear is more than 50 percent of our non-carbon causing energy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo people who think that we can get there without nuclear being part of the blend just aren\u2019t looking at the facts.\u201d\n\nLater, in a Sept. 19 interview with the HuffPost, Booker called out his colleagues who oppose nuclear power, saying, \u201cAs much as we say the Republicans when it comes to climate change must listen to science, our party has the same obligation to listen to scientists,\u201d he said. \u201cThe data speaks for itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had a president who was going to pull us out of nuclear, we\u2019d be more reliant on fossil fuels,\u201d Booker added. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ll explain, there is support for each perspective, although Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems engineer and professor at Princeton University, said both politicians are \u201cmaking stronger claims than there\u2019s a scientific basis.\u201d Sanders, Jenkins explained, can point to published studies that outline how one can get to zero-carbon without nuclear. \u201cThose exist,\u201d he said. And bolstering Booker\u2019s side, he said, is the \u201cpredominance of the evidence\u201d that suggests the most cost-effective way of decarbonizing would include \u201csome nuclear.\u201d\n\nThe debate over nuclear energy isn\u2019t limited to Booker and Sanders, even if relatively few Democratic candidates have addressed nuclear power in their climate plans. Former Vice President Joe Biden backs nuclear technology research, as does entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who views nuclear as a \u201cstopgap\u201d measure and plans on having next-gen reactors up and running by 2027.\n\nAlthough not written into her climate plan, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said during her town hall segment that she would not build any more nuclear plants and would \u201cstart weaning\u201d the country off nuclear energy. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also committed to not expanding the number of nuclear plants \u201cunless we can find safe storage.\u201d\n\nWithout diving into the details of individual plans, we\u2019ll lay out what scientists know about the role of nuclear energy in decarbonizing the electrical grid.\n\nTo start, we\u2019ll consider Sanders\u2019 claim that \u201cscientists tell us\u201d that it\u2019s possible to get to a zero-carbon electrical grid without nuclear power.\n\n\u201cThe shortest answer is yes, that\u2019s true. Scientists do tell us that we can,\u201d said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University\u2019s Nicholas School of the Environment.\n\nRyan Jones, an expert in electricity systems and a co-founder of Evolved Energy Research, a consulting company that models low-carbon transitions, agreed. \u201cAnyone who says that nuclear is 100% necessary on a technical basis, I would claim, just hasn\u2019t looked at the alternatives in enough detail,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nMost experts FactCheck.org contacted, including those who think nuclear power should remain an option, said that from a technical perspective, nuclear is not needed to decarbonize the grid.\n\nBut technically possible is not the same as practically feasible, or the most cost-effective. In that regard, many, although not all, researchers say nuclear \u2014 or something like it \u2014 is likely to be necessary to some degree. And even if nuclear is ultimately not needed, they say, the safer strategy is not to exclude it.\n\n\u201cAll the evidence says it is possible to decarbonize the energy system in the U.S. without using nuclear power,\u201d said Jones. But, he added, there are cases, such as places that don\u2019t have good wind resources, in which building new nuclear plants can reduce the cost of decarbonizing. Depending on the region, he said, \u201cgetting to 100% renewable energy is either very expensive or necessitates significant new transmission to import resources from elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where nuclear can be helpful. It doesn\u2019t have to be nuclear \u2014 Jones said carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS, for example, would also work. Sanders\u2019 plan, notably, specifically excludes CCS.\n\nJones also made a point to note that there is a difference between building new nuclear plants, which he said likely wouldn\u2019t be ready to go until after 2030 anyway, and maintaining the nation\u2019s existing reactors. Much of the future of nuclear power depends on the development of advanced technologies, but there is little disagreement that keeping safely operating plants around for as long as possible would be a boon for the climate. \u201cMaintaining our existing fleet is a good way to keep costs low and an accelerated retirement schedule simply makes it that much harder,\u201d he said.\n\nShindell said that while Sanders is correct in a strict sense, the \u201cmore complete\u201d answer is that eliminating nuclear as an option would complicate the effort to decarbonize, requiring the \u201cmost extreme\u201d levels of action in other areas to reach the zero-carbon goal. \u201cThe more you take away one zero-carbon option,\u201d he said, \u201cthe harder you have to push on the others.\u201d\n\nWhen scientists have modeled the ways the planet as a whole can avoid the worst effects of climate change \u2014 and limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \u2014 nuclear power is almost always part of the solution. In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s 2018 special report, scientists described 85 pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, or overshooting that threshold and returning to 1.5 degrees or below by 2100.\n\nShindell, who was one of the coordinating lead authors on the chapter, told us that it was a rare scenario that met or mostly met the 1.5 degrees limit and didn\u2019t have nuclear power in the mix. \u201cVery few, almost none in fact, can achieve 1.5 without nuclear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very extreme scenario that can do that. And it requires enormous gains in all the zero-carbon sources.\u201d\n\nA large number of scenarios expanded nuclear power, Shindell said, to around double today\u2019s level. He estimated that 90% of the scenarios included nuclear capacity above today\u2019s level, and just one or two scenarios phased out nuclear entirely by 2100.\n\nThere are pathways, the report says, that \u201cno longer see a role for nuclear fission by the end of the century.\u201d But none include no nuclear as early as 2030 or 2050.\n\nBecause the scenarios are global, the results don\u2019t necessarily mean that the U.S. must keep or expand its nuclear power. And the scenarios are inherently limited to the types of studies scientists do, Shindell said. Still, the IPCC findings suggest that in a broad sense, most roads to success include nuclear reactors.\n\nConsider, too, the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report from 2014, which was the first to include scenarios that excluded certain technologies. In the nuclear phase out scenario, eight of nine tested scenarios were able to reach the target CO2 concentration level of 430-480 parts per million, or the equivalent of reaching 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But the limitation in technology increased the median costs by 7% (see figure 6.24 and table SPM.2). The phase out assumed that existing plants could operate until the end of their lifetime, but did not allow for any new nuclear plants beyond those already under construction.\n\nA 2013 study cited in the 2014 IPCC report used an integrated assessment model to learn what might happen globally if nations stopped building any new nuclear plants in 2020. The authors concluded it was \u201cin principle feasible\u201d to transform the energy system and limit carbon dioxide concentrations to 450 parts per million. But they noted that it would require \u201cmassive and rapid expansion\u201d of other low-emissions technology, such as renewables and carbon capture and sequestration.\n\n\u201cThis underscores the fact that, in general, nuclear energy can be regarded as a choice rather than a necessity, and different regional and national attitudes toward nuclear energy can be accommodated,\u201d the paper reads. \u201cOn the other hand, the forced phase-out of nuclear energy by 2020 would increase the required investments into the energy system transformation and would limit future supply-side flexibility, resulting in comparatively higher costs of CO2.\u201d\n\nOn a more local level, such as for individual countries or regions, scientists can perform much more detailed models of the electrical grid or energy system over space and time to determine the viability of various power mixes and their costs. Sometimes, such models are designed to find the lowest-cost option, while others are set up to test the robustness of the system.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear from these modeling efforts is that the clearest and cheapest path forward to decarbonization is to rapidly expand renewable power, especially wind and solar. In a variety of studies, including those from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and others, large amounts of renewable power can be added to the grid without sacrificing reliability and without imposing excessively high costs. But there is some disagreement on how far renewables, on their own, can go.\n\nOne prominent paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015 argued that in the U.S., 100% renewable energy is possible at low cost by 2050-2055. But numerous scientists objected to that analysis, and two separate groups, including one with more than 20 authors, published critiques; the original authors also penned rebuttals.\n\nChristopher Clack, the lead author of the primary critique and the founder and CEO of Vibrant Clean Energy, a company that does high-resolution electrical grid modeling, says he has yet to be convinced that 100% renewables is possible in the U.S. In his view, the concept is theoretically possible, but unlikely to be feasible in practice.\n\n\u201cWe can get all the way within a model, but in reality we probably cannot due to the imperfections of forecasts, dispatch, measurements, etc.,\u201d he said. And for him, cost is not an ancillary issue. \u201cIf it is not possible at low-cost, it is not possible in reality,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause alternatives will be used instead.\u201d\n\nRegardless, each time he\u2019s looked at studies that claim to show a successful 100% renewable grid, he\u2019s found problems. Some models, he said, don\u2019t go into granular enough detail, which can \u201csmear out\u201d challenging times for an all-renewable grid, such as an extreme cold snap. Other papers, he said, rely on unproven technology or unrealistic costs.\n\nThe fundamental issue for renewables, of course, is weather variability, and how to handle the times when the wind doesn\u2019t blow and the sun doesn\u2019t shine. In Clack\u2019s view, this challenge can mostly \u2014 but not fully \u2014 be solved by adding storage and creating a more connected and responsive electrical grid. In 2016, while working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Clack published one of the first \u201csupergrid\u201d papers in Nature Climate Change, which showed that by building out high-voltage, direct-current transmission lines, the U.S. could lower its electricity-sector carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 80% below 1990\u2019s level, without an increase in the cost of electricity.\n\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory similarly found that existing renewable technology, coupled with a more flexible grid, \u201cis more than adequate\u201d to supply 80% of the nation\u2019s electricity in 2050.\n\nBut to actually provide 100% of the nation\u2019s electricity at a reasonable cost, Clack said there needs to be a non-variable source, which could include \u2014 but isn\u2019t limited to \u2014 nuclear power.\n\nThe importance of including some non-variable sources was also underscored in a 2018 review co-authored by Princeton\u2019s Jenkins. That paper, which appeared in the journal Joule, reviewed 40 studies published since the IPCC\u2019s 2014 report that explored pathways on either a global or local scale for \u201cdeep decarbonization,\u201d defined as an 80%-100% cut in current CO2 emissions. It found that all 20 of the studies that took an agnostic approach to finding the most affordable way to go about deep decarbonization ultimately selected a power mix that included at least one low-carbon \u201cfirm\u201d resource, such as nuclear power or fossil fuels coupled with CCS.\n\nAs Jenkins explained it, while wind and solar can do the bulk of the work, as renewable penetration approaches 100%, problems emerge and costs rise sharply. He told us that most storage \u2014 largely lithium-ion batteries \u2014 can help with daily variation, but is insufficient for when the sun and wind stall for weeks at a time over a large geographic area, or what\u2019s known as the \u201cdark doldrums.\u201d Adding even more storage capacity might be able to do the trick, he said, but that storage would be expensive to build and rarely used. The economics of such a scenario are bleak. Even assuming costs fall to less than a third of today\u2019s, Jenkins\u2019 review calculated that it would cost more than $7 trillion to build out enough lithium-ion batteries to store a week\u2019s worth of electricity in the U.S. That\u2019s almost 19 times the amount spent on the nation\u2019s electricity over one year.\n\nNot everyone holds this view. Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and director of the school\u2019s Renewable & Appropriate Energy Laboratory, objected to the 2015 PNAS paper, but nevertheless thinks that 100% renewables are an achievable goal. \u201cThey are wrong,\u201d he said in an email, adding that 100% clean energy is possible with solar, wind and hydro when supported with storage. Kammen, who is a former science envoy to the State Department under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, did not reply to further questions, but pointed to his lab\u2019s energy system model. In 2016, his group used the model to evaluate costs under a variety of assumptions for a large swath of western North America to reach a target of 85% below 1990 emissions levels by 2050.\n\nTrieu Mai, a senior energy researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said the science remains unsettled over the economic viability of the various zero-carbon power options.\n\n\u201cI do not believe there has been sufficient analysis to conclusively say which technologies are necessary to reach zero emission power or energy systems,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThere is strong consensus in the literature that growth in renewable energy will be required,\u201d he added, \u201cbut the extent of this growth (i.e., whether it should reach 100%) is still under debate.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the larger question of how to decarbonize the energy system may come down to differences in philosophy rather than the science, which is not clear-cut, and involves assumptions about the future.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single scientific truth here,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cIt\u2019s a debate about priorities and feasibility, which is defined in a number of different ways by a number of different parties.\u201d\n\nFor Jenkins, though, banking only on solar and wind would be a \u201cmistake.\u201d \u201cGiven the high stakes,\u201d he wrote in his 2018 review, \u201cit would be prudent to expand and improve a wide set of clean energy resources, each of which may fill the critical niche for firm, low-carbon power should other technologies falter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re really in a \u2018climate crisis,\u2019 then you go to war with your full arsenal,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cYou don\u2019t hold anything back. And you don\u2019t purposefully make this crisis harder by limiting our already limited options.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
