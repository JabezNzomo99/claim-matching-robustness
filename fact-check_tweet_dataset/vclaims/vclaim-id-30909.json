This claim is misleading. North Carolina did not ban and criminalize the practice of sharia law, according to state records \u2014 nor could it have, under the US Constitution.\n\nThe post shows an image of the North Carolina map with the caption, \u201cNorth Carolina has banned Islamic sharia law and regard it as criminal, as it should be\u2026Lets make it nation-wide.\u201d It has been shared more than 50,000 times since April 2019.\n\nThis claim is misleading. The First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which applies to North Carolina, ensures the free exercise of religion, including Islam.\n\nHowever, North Carolina passed a law in 2013 that prevents state judges from using foreign law, which may include sharia law, to decide cases.\n\nThe law, intended to \u201cprotect its citizens from the application of foreign law that would result in the violation of a fundamental constitutional right,\u201d does not ban individual religious practice.\n\nIn a 2018 article for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a US non-profit organization which fights for civil rights, senior research analyst Swathi Shanmugasundaram called the legislation \u201ctotally useless,\u201d since the US Constitution already denies authority to foreign law.\n\nTwo years before the passage of the law, the American Bar Association formally denounced measures that place blanket bans on the application of foreign laws in American courts.\n\nAlthough the legislation may stand up legally, \u201csuch initiatives that target an entire religion or stigmatize an entire religious community, such as those explicitly aimed at \u2018Sharia law,\u2019 are inconsistent with some of the core principles and ideals of American jurisprudence,\u201d the ABA statement reads.\n\nSharia law is practiced in the courts of numerous Muslim-majority countries, but it is not a monolithic system.\n\nAs of 2019, twelve other US states have passed this type of law, and 43 states have either proposed or passed bills of this kind, according to an Islamophobia report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy organization for Muslims in the US.", "lang": "en"}
