They have attempted to use the photo to connect Gates to Ghislaine Maxwell through an alleged familial connection.\n\n\u201cBill Gates with Rabbi Schneerson the head of the Jewish extremist end times cult Chabad Lubavitch,\u201d reads the text accompanying the image. \u201cGate\u2019s mother is a Maxwell, related to the Israeli Mossad agents Robert Maxwell and his daughter Ghislaine, who used child trafficking to blackmail world leaders with Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d\n\nBut Gates is not pictured. A reverse image search reveals the photo was published in a 2014 Jerusalem Post article. It does, in fact, depict the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, but the man the post claims to be Gates is actually the author of the article, Yosef Abramowitz, per the photo\u2019s caption.\n\nGates\u2019 mother was born Mary Maxwell in Seattle in 1929, the daughter of James Willard Maxwell and Adele Thompson, according to the biography \u201cHard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire.\u201d There is no evidence she is related to Robert Maxwell or his daughter Ghislaine Maxwell, who both lived in the U.K. for most of their lives.\n\nMedia mogul Robert Maxwell was born Jan Ludv\u00edk Hyman Binyamin Hoch in 1923 in Czechoslovakia and only changed his name in 1948 after moving to the U.K., nearly 20 years after Mary Maxwell was born on a different continent, per Business Insider.\n\nSome people have linked Robert Maxwell to the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, a popular but unproven claim, according to The Daily Mail. Similar unsubstantiated rumors surround Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, The Sun reported.

She is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where she awaits trial after being denied bail, per The Associated Press.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
