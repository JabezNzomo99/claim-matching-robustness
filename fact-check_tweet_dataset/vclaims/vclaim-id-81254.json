Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) cited corporate earnings reports, but some context is missing.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2014-05-12T23:40:21Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-81254", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/05/13/michelle-bachmans-claim-that-obamacare-is-hurting-the-bottom-line-of-american-businesses/", "vclaim": "Rep. Bachmann made the comments above while appearing on one of the Sunday morning shows. (We removed the interruptions by her Democratic foil, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.) Bachmann is a Fact Checker favorite, so of course we wanted to see what was behind her data.\n\nBut she errs when she asserts that because people are \u201cvery unhappy \u2026 so they want it changed.\u201d That\u2019s because another recent Pew poll shows that a majority of those ACA opponents \u2013 representing 30 percent of the public \u2013 wants politicians to do what they can to make the law work as well as possible. Even among Republicans who disliked the law, slightly less than half also had that sentiment.\n\nAs for the businesses affected by the law, here Bachmann is seizing on a report that 7 percent of the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index that have disclosed corporate earnings have mentioned the Affordable Care Act. Yep, we said 7 percent.\n\nMoreover, it turns out that roughly half of those companies are in the health-care industry, including General Electric. GE cited the fact that hospitals and clinics were delaying purchases, and so the performance of its health-care unit was lagging.\n\nBut when a company such as UnitedHealth Group says that the law is affecting its profits in part because it now must accept clients with pre-existing conditions, most Americans probably would not weep. Moreover, if millions of previously uninsured people start getting health insurance, those initial negative impacts will be forgotten by investors as insurance company earnings rise. (UnitedHealth\u2019s chief executive said long-term prospects showed \u201cgrowth opportunities.\u201d)\n\nBachmann also mentioned UPS and Dollar General, and here she has a slightly stronger case. Both companies blamed the law for increasing costs and overhead, though in the relative scheme of things, it seemed like chump change. (Dollar General said the law would cost two or three cents a share.)\n\nIn fact, given that the employer mandate was delayed until 2015, it\u2019s unclear what additional costs these companies face now, except it certainly is a convenient excuse if a company is in danger of missing Wall Street forecasts, as was the case for both companies. (UPS, in fact, set the stage for a major one-time charge to its earnings.)\n\nBachmann spokesman Dan Kotman said: \u201cUSA Today called it a \u2018healthy cross section of companies,\u2019 so it\u2019s a matter of interpretation. They also cite an expert who says: \u2018Expect more companies to cite the costs of the law in future earnings reports.\u2019 But where the facts are concerned, she said major companies like GE, UPS, and Dollar General have reported that Obamacare is hurting their earnings, which is what the USA Today story says.\u201d\n\nBachmann\u2019s remarks are missing important context. She\u2019s right that the law still has high disapproval ratings, though increasingly Americans want to move on from the political battles and try to make the law more effective. As for the impact on corporate bottom lines, a handful of quarterly earnings reports certainly does not suggest much of a trend.", "lang": "en"}
