The claim, which has circulated online for over a decade in multiple different misleading social media posts, is false; medical experts told AFP there is no scientific evidence that drinking cold water gives you cancer.\n\nThis Facebook post, published in April 2013, has been shared more than 320,000 times.\n\nPart of the lengthy caption reads: \"It is nice to have a cup of cold drink after a meal. However, the cold water will solidify the oily stuff that you have just consumed.\n\n\n\n \u201cIt will slow down the digestion. Once this 'sludge' reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. It will line the intestine.\n\n\n\n \u201cVery soon, this will turn into fats and lead to cancer. It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nSimilar claims have been shared hundreds of thousands of times here and here on Facebook.\n\nThe claim is false; multiple cancer experts told AFP there is no scientific proof to support the claim; the claim has circulated online for over a decade and has been repeatedly debunked by independent fact checkers.\n\nProfessor Sanchia Aranda, CEO of Cancer Council Australia, emailed a statement to AFP on August 7, 2019, which reads, in part:\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence to support the claim that drinking cold water will lead to the development of cancer. When cold beverages are consumed, the liquid quickly warms to body temperature and has no adverse effect on the way the body digests food.\u201d\n\nAn American Cancer Society spokesperson also told AFP via email on August 16 that they knew of \u201cno credible evidence to support the claim.\u201d\n\nThe false claim has circulated online for at least over a decade, such as here, here and here on Facebook in 2008 and 2010.\n\nFact-check website Snopes also debunked the claim in this 2006 report.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked claims that drinking warm water can cure all types of cancer.\n\nA public health official told AFP in this fact check report that water \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the power to cure illnesses,\u201d nor is it harmful either.\n\n\u201cWater is vital for life, but of course it doesn\u2019t have the power to cure illnesses,\u201d said Bruno Falissard, director of the Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health at French research institute Inserm and public health professor at Paris-Saclay university.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if water is hot or cold. It isn\u2019t a cure and it isn\u2019t harmful either. The body can tolerate water between 0 and 40 degrees,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nIn a similar claim debunked by AFP, a misleading post claimed that: \"Research proves that drinking iced water during menstruation can cause menstrual blood to clot and remain in the uterine lining (which) after 5-10 years can cause womb cancer or tumours.\u201d\n\nGynecologist Kiyoshi Macotela Nakagaki said that there was \"no link between consuming coconut water or iced water and this type of disease -- neither cancer nor infertility.\"\n\n\"This claim has no scientific basis,\" Kiyoshi Macotela Nakagaki said.\n\nAFP has also debunked claims that drinking hot water, eating a no sugar diet, and eating coconut oil will cure cancer.", "lang": "en"}
