Further findings of the kidnap cases from June 2019 to June 2020 was verified in comparison with abductions from June 2018 and June 2019.\n\nIt revealed that 1,236 persons were kidnapped between June 2018 and June 2019, while there was a total of 9,443 casualties from all forms of insecurity that bedevilled the country within the same period.\n\nBut between June 2019 and June 2020, a total of 1,724 kidnap cases were recorded and 8,802 total deaths claimed by insecurity within the period under study.\n\nThe data above showed a difference of 488 more cases of abductions this year when compared with the previous year.\n\nThough the 2019 Global Rights Mass Atrocities Casualties Tracking report identified a total of 3,188 killings due to insecurity in the country between January to December 2019, no similar report has been released for 2020 to benchmark the actual deaths recorded as a result of kidnapping and banditry.\n\nHowever, from the 3,188 deaths recorded in the independent report last year, 2,707 were civilians.\n\nFrom the overall figure, 1,075 of the casualties were killed due to banditry, the second-highest figure was 702 which was attributed to the Boko Haram insurgency followed by electoral violence which reportedly claimed 605 lives, among other categories. The report only recorded 117 abductions in 2019.\n\nThe report further noted that the highest killings in the country per month occurred in June 2019 with 504 deaths.\n\n\u201c\u2026banditry and extrajudicial killings moved at an incremental pace westward, affecting communities in Niger and Kogi States,\u201d the global right report stated.\n\nHowever, The ICIR could not get data on the number of banditry cases recorded for 2019 and 2020. As stated earlier, it only confirmed that 1,075 deaths were recorded from banditry in 2019 alone.\n\nBased on available data as shown above, cases of kidnapping has dropped considerably, as claimed by Lai Mohammed. So, the claim by the minister is indeed TRUE.", "lang": "en"}
