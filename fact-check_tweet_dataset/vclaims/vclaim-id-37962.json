There is absolutely no proof of any of that, and I am not aware of any actions like this,\" Butina said, \u201crejecting,\u201d according to TASS, \u201callegations that there were [sic] some \u2018government person\u2019 behind her.\u201d\n\nTASS\u2019s rendering of this portion of the 60 Minutes interview is misleading.\n\nFirst, TASS makes no mention of Alexander Torshin, whom Butina admitted had \u201cdirected\u201d her activities as a foreign agent in the United States.\n\nTorshin, who resigned as deputy governor of Russia\u2019s Central Bank in November 2018 \u2013 one month prior to Butina\u2019s guilty plea \u2013 was also a former Russian senator who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Politico, a U.S. newspaper, FBI counterintelligence linked Torshin to a \u201cU.S.-Russia exchange program\u201d that the agency alleges \u201cwas an elaborate cover for a Washington-based Russian spy recruiting effort.\u201d\n\nPolitico also reported that Torshin helped facilitate the so-called \u201cIllegals Program\u201d spy swap, in which 10 Russian operatives who had been living undercover in the U.S. for years (including \u201cAnna Chapman\u201d) were exchanged for four Russian citizens imprisoned by Russia on espionage charges.\n\nIn April 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Torshin for election interference, while Spanish investigators have linked him to Russian mafia activity.\n\nCBS reported it obtained thousands of private Twitter messages between Butina and Torshin, which apparently caught Butina off guard.\n\nOne exchange went as follows:\n\nStahl: So you wrote him a message and you said, \"You are an influential member of [Putin's] team.\" Your words.\n\nButina: It doesn't suggest he's close to Putin in any way.\n\nStahl: But was he an influential member of Putin's team?\n\nStahl: Well, you wrote that. You know, in reading through your messages it reads as if he's -- your intelligence case officer.\n\nButina: Look, this is-- I think it's an American, very old saying that suggests that wolves have teeth, but not all animals with teeth are wolves. You cannot judge a person based on appearance.\n\nStahl did not merely allege some government person was behind Butina, as reported by TASS.\n\nStahl said \u201cyou can get the impression that there's some government person higher than Torshin kinda directing this whole thing, pulling the strings,\u201d citing actions that implied \u201cthey needed to run the decision up to a more senior level.\u201d\n\nJohn Demers, the U.S. assistant attorney general for national security, in a CBS interview called Butina\u2019s answers \u201ca masterpiece of disinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt had conflation, obfuscation, changing the subject, accusing you of being sexist, accusing the American people of being racist against Russians whenever the questions got difficult\u2026 trying to change the topic. Partial denials,\u201d Demers told 60 Minutes.\n\nAs Stahl noted, upon being greeted with a \u201cmedia frenzy\u201d after returning to Moscow, Butina \u201cimmediately started giving interviews about the conditions of her incarceration.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the TASS article, titled \u201cButina says being in US prison was 'torture',\u201d hit on many of those disinformation themes, while ignoring most of the evidence presented by Stahl and opting not to mention Torshin at all.\n\nPolygraph.info thus finds TASS\u2019s presentation of the Butina interview to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
