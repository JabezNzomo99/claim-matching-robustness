This is false; General Daniel Butterfield came up with the music, \u201cTaps, \u201d an adaptation from an existing bugle call \u201cTattoo,\u201d while his brigade was camped in Confederate territory.\n\nThe August 2, 2020 post tells the story of Captain Elli, who, during the Civil War, \u201cheard the moans of a soldier who lay severely wounded on the field.\u201d That \u201cConfederate soldier\u201d turned out to be the captain\u2019s son, and he then created \u201cTaps\u201d to celebrate his son\u2019s memory at the funeral.\n\nElli asked a bugler \u201cto play a series of musical notes he had found on a piece of paper in the pocket of the dead youth's uniform. This wish was granted. The haunting melody, we now know as \u2018Taps\u2019 used at military funerals was born,\u201d the post reads.\n\nSimilar Facebook posts can also be found, here, and on an \u201cAll American Patriot\u201d page here.\n\n\u201cIt is a heartwarming and poignant story, but false,\u201d wrote Jari Villanueva, a \u201cTaps\u201d historian and professional bugler. Villanueva is one of the few specialists in \u201cTaps\u201d and its history. He wrote a paper, found on the state of Virginia\u2019s website, about the melody\u2019s origins and dedicated an article to the \u201cTaps Myth\u201d on his blog.\n\n\u201cThe story of Captain Robert Ellicombe (or Ellison, or Elli) and his Confederate son is a myth, a fake, a tall tale, a good anecdote to tell around the old campfire, but a story that, outside of the fact it takes place at Harrison\u2019s Landing, holds no truth whatsoever,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTaps, according to the historian, was adapted by General Daniel Butterfield in 1862 from an already existing bugle melody called \u201cTattoo\u201d or \u201cScott Tattoo\u201d from 1835. Similarities can be found in both melodies. The full story of \u201cTaps\u201d can also be found on the Arlington National Cemetery\u2019s page, here.\n\nThis version of the story concurs with historical transcripts. In New York State and the Civil War, published in 1962, Oliver Norton, the bugler who helped Butterfield with the melody, is quoted: \u201cOne day, soon after the seven days\u2019 battles on the Peninsular, when the Army of the Potomac was lying in camp at Harrison\u2019s Landing, General Daniel Butterfield, then commanding our Brigade, sent for me, and showing me some notes on a staff written in pencil on the back of an envelope, asked me to sound them on my bugle... After getting it to his satisfaction, he directed me to sound that call for \u2018Taps\u2019 thereafter in place of the regulation call.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe myth has been around for a long time,\u201d Villanueva told AFP by email, \u201cButterfield is credited with \u2018Taps\u2019 but he is not mentioned in the \u2018Taps myth.\u2019\u201d\n\nButterfield never had children, Villanueva confirmed to AFP -- making the rest of the story baseless.\n\nEDIT: This post was updated on September 15, 2020 to change the header image", "lang": "en"}
