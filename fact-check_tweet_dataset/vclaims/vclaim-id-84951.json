So we turned to The Post\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of police shootings, chronicling the most comprehensive database of police shootings than any government agency had ever done before.\n\nIn 2015, Post researchers identified 990 fatal shootings, more than twice the number recorded in a single year by the federal government. Black people were shot and killed at 2.5 times the rate of white people in 2015. This rate is adjusted for populations where the shootings occurred. So Johnson\u2019s statistic is not accurate.\n\nJohnson gets it almost right if he\u2019s referring to unarmed black men. The Post\u2019s analysis found unarmed black men were seven times more likely than their white counterparts to be shot. Johnson\u2019s campaign noted this statistic, as well as other findings using the Post\u2019s database, and said the \u201cdata is subject to varying interpretations, including some which arrive at a \u2018lower\u2019 ratio of blacks to whites.\u201d\n\nJohnson said black people are four times more likely than white people to go to jail after being arrested. Again, this was quite confusing; there\u2019s no reliable national data by race on rates of bookings at local jails or convictions after arrest.\n\nCampaign spokesman Joe Hunter clarified that Johnson was referring to racial disparity in marijuana arrests, per a 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union. Hunter noted that in the original Fox News interview, Johnson had specified drug arrests: \u201cWhen it comes to the war on drugs, if you are of color, there\u2019s a four times more likelihood that you\u2019ll end up behind bars.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU analyzed national and county-level marijuana arrest data reported by the FBI, from 2000 to 2010. Blacks were 3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession. The report uses publicly available arrest data and calculates the rate using census population estimates. This report is most often cited for racial disparity in marijuana possession arrests, and is more detailed than the data that federal agencies analyze on a national level.\n\nHe has a point. There is documented racial disparity throughout the stages of the criminal justice process, showing black people were treated less favorably than white people, including in pretrial detention decisions. Among people with comparable criminal records and convicted of the same crime, black and Hispanic defendants were \u201csomewhat more likely than whites to be sentenced to incarceration,\u201d a 2014 National Academy of Sciences study found. And black defendants were less likely than whites to be diverted to punishments other than incarceration.\n\nThe theory is that black people are more likely to be held in jail, partly because the black men booked in jail have lower incomes than other races and can\u2019t afford bail. The longer you\u2019re held in jail, the more likely you are to be convicted of the crime due to a variety of factors, including losing your job and not being able to afford a high-quality lawyer.\n\n\u201cWhile Gary Johnson is to be applauded for calling attention to racial disparities in the justice system, the disparities we see once relevant factors are taken into account are not as extreme as indicated by his statements,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project.\n\nData confirm blacks are more likely to be shot and killed by police than whites, and more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites. And there is documented racial disparity throughout the criminal justice system that show black defendants have a higher likelihood of being sentenced to incarceration than whites. But Johnson bungled his talking points that skewed the numbers all out of context.", "lang": "en"}
