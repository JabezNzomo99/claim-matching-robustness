We are not doing this effectively enough at present, and are looking at ways in which we can improve this.\u201d It also said that patients without ID will be referred to the \u201cOverseas Patient Team for specialist document screening\u201d.\n\nAnyone who is not \u201cordinarily resident in the UK\u201d can be charged for the use of NHS hospital services in England and Wales, except for emergency services such as A&E. There are one or two exceptions to this, such as refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nIt has been (roughly) estimated that the NHS spends around \u00a32 billion a year treating patients who aren\u2019t ordinarily resident.\n\nEU citizens don\u2019t have to pay. There are arrangements in place by which the UK can charge their home government for the care they receive.\n\nDepartment of Health guidelines say that \u201call relevant NHS bodies will need to have systems in place to support charging of overseas visitors\u2026[Staff should] identify, without discrimination, all patients who may be liable to charges.\u201d The guidelines suggest that this should be done by interviewing patients to find out whether or not they should be charged.\n\nThe guidelines also say that \u201cbooking-in staff, ward clerks etc. will need to be prepared to ask for basic supporting evidence. Being unable to provide evidence does not mean that someone should be refused treatment, only that they should be referred to the OVM for further investigation.\u201d This seems to be exactly what St George\u2019s Hospital has proposed to do.\n\nWhat about the rest of the NHS?\n\nThe government is looking at whether or not patients should be required to bring identification when using non-emergency NHS England services. As with St George\u2019s Hospital, the focus is on finding more effective ways of identifying patients eligible to be charged\u2014which in theory should be happening already.\n\nChris Wormald, the Permanent Secretary for the Department of Health, told a committee of MPs that \u201cfor the majority of free healthcare, hospitals do not routinely either check identity or charge, so we are trying to introduce this system\u201d. He also mentioned that some hospitals are trialling a system of asking patients for two forms of identification, their passport and proof of address.\n\nThe Department of Health told us that \"The NHS is a national\u2014not an international\u2014health service and we are determined to stamp out abuse of the system to ensure it remains free at the point of need in this country. We consulted earlier this year on extending the charging of migrants and visitors using the NHS. We will set out further steps in due course to ensure we deliver on our objective to recover up to \u00a3500 million a year by the middle of this Parliament.\u201d\n\nWe updated this piece to include information on what the government has said about the future use of identification and charging those eligible across the NHS.", "lang": "en"}
