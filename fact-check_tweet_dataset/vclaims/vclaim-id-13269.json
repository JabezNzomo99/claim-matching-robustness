Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: Vehicular users would be exempted from paying toll charges at toll booths if they return in 12 hours. Fact: There is neither an official letter from National Highways Authority of India(NHAI) nor any mention by Minister of Road Transport & Highways Sri Nitin Gadkari anywhere regarding the exemption from paying toll charges if the vehicular users return in 12 hours. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched in the National Highways Authority of India website there is no letter issued by it regarding the toll exemption for vehicular users if they return in 12 hours. The message seemed to be on the name of Sri Nitin Gadkari, but there was no mention of such a thing in media or any other social media platforms by him regarding the claim. It was also found that such the message has been in circulation on Whatsapp and Facebook since the past 2 years. Last year when the same message went viral, India today has communicated with Sri Nitin Gadkari\u2019s office, which outrightly denied the existence of any such order or statement.\n\nFinally, the news regarding toll exemption at tollbooth when you come back in 12 hours is false.", "lang": "en"}
