The main reason is that in the federal employee health plan, premiums are not affected by age; the young and old pay the same rate, depending on family status. But on the exchanges, older workers can pay as much as three times as much as younger workers. That\u2019s an improvement for individual plans in the pre-ACA world system \u2014 where the \u201cage band\u201d could be five or more times greater \u2014 but there is premium-shock if someone, such as Boehner, is 64 and moving from a community-rated plan.\n\nDuring the 2009 debate over the law, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) offered an amendment in the Senate Finance Committee that put members of Congress and staff on the exchanges. Grassley has long sought to have laws passed by Congress apply to Congress, and his amendment was adopted. In the Finance Committee, amendments are not written in precise legislative language, but here\u2019s how it described staff who would be covered: \u201cA Congressional employee would be one whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House of Representatives.\u201d Similar language appeared in the final version of the Senate Finance bill.\n\n\u201cIt appears possible to argue that the definition of \u2018congressional staff\u2019 used [by the provision] excludes any staff not directly affiliated with a Member\u2019s individual or personal office,\u201d the CRS report said. \u201cShould this interpretation be adopted by an implementing body or a court, it would appear that it would exclude professional committee staff, joint committee staff, some shared staff, as well as potentially those staff employed by leadership offices including, but not limited to, the Speaker of the House, Majority Leader of the Senate, Minority Leader of the House, Minority Leader of the Senate, as well as the Whip offices in both the House and Senate.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
