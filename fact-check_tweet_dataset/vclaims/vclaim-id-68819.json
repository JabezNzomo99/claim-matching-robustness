The bill\u2019s goal is to increase the reliability of services by the Federal Emergency Management Agency after disasters.\n\nIn a news release, Hartzler gave an example of the problems the bill attempted to prevent: \"In Missouri, there are still (FEMA) cases pending from floods that occurred in 2013.\"\n\nThe flooding Hartzler is referring to took place from Aug. 2, 2013, to Aug. 14, 2013. Residents across Missouri were hit by pounding rain, wind and flooding. According to the National Weather Service, rainfall levels reached 8 to 10 inches.\n\nAt the time, Pulaski County officials said at least 90 percent of roads were damaged by flooding. While other counties experienced 8 to 10 inches of rain, Pulaski saw 15.\n\nTo begin the process for additional funding, Pulaski County was expected to submit design plans to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for reconstruction of county bridges. The corps denied the plans because they did not meet permitting requirements.\n\nIn November 2017, FEMA granted the appeal for $4.4 million in federal share to the state of Missouri to assist Pulaski County in completing physical work such as bridge and road repair. While Pulaski County received additional funding in November, FEMA will continue the case until all physical repair work is completed.\n\nWhile most counties in Missouri have had their resolutions to their claims involving flooding in August 2013, Pulaski County has had a long battle with FEMA over funding in the last four years. The approval for the last round of funds went out after Hartzler\u2019s news release at the end of October. Pulaski County is awaiting physical repairs, and FEMA does not close cases until physical repairs are completed.\n\nAlthough what Hartzler said is true, there is only one case that was still pending when she made her comment. Hartzler\u2019s statement sounds as though there are multiple cases that FEMA had not responded to. Her statement is accurate but needs additional information or clarification.", "lang": "en"}
