Are there really 20,000 fewer bobbies on the beat since the Tories took office? And what does that mean for security?\n\nIn March 2010, the total number of police officers in England and Wales was 143,734. By March 2016, that figure had fallen to 124,066 (government data source here).\n\nSo Jeremy Corbyn is right that officer numbers have fallen by around 20,000 since the Tories took office.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, those are all police officers \u2013 the figure does not include cuts to civilian staff. And when we break those numbers down by rank we see that of the 20,000 officers cut, over 13,000 were constables, and around 4,000 were sergeants.\n\nOf course the total number of junior officers is much larger, and proportionate to their starting size, it\u2019s actually senior ranks who have taken the biggest hit. Around a quarter of superintendents have been cut since 2010.\n\nBut it\u2019s still a 12 per cent fall in constable numbers, and an 18 per cent drop in sergeants.\n\nThe Home Office were keen to remind us that the number of police on the streets is for local Police and Crime Commissioners to decide. But as we pointed out in a FactCheck last month, central government funding for the police has been cut under the Tories. This has correlated with a fall in the number of non-armed officers.\n\n(You might also be interested in our FactCheck on the number of armed police, which shows they\u2019ve also fallen under the Tories).\n\nWhat about cuts to the front line?\n\nWe should bear in mind that not all police officers are on the front line.\n\nIn fact, we called David Cameron out on this in 2011 (remember him?), when Tory cuts to police funding had just started to take effect. At the time, the Conservatives were using their newly-minted definitions of \u201cfront line\u201d and \u201cvisible\u201d policing to skew reports of how austerity would affect forces.\n\nTo avoid falling into that trap ourselves, we\u2019ve tried to work out how many of the 20,000 officers cut since 2010 are actually bobbies on the beat, and how many are cuts to backroom officers.\n\nWe asked the Home Office and the Police Federation for statistics on this, but they weren\u2019t able to give us the full picture.\n\nWe\u2019ll update if they do, but in the meantime, here\u2019s our best estimate of how many officers on the front line have been cut.\n\nIn 2011, the government asked Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabularies (HMIC) to come up with a definition of front line policing. You can see the full report here. It concluded that the definition of front line officers should include nearly all police in \u201cvisible\u201d roles (like 999 responders and community officers) and \u201cmiddle office\u201d positions (like CID and specialist investigators).\n\nUnfortunately, the government and HMIC only started collecting data on the number of front line officers from 2013, so we can\u2019t look at the Tories\u2019 entire record in government.\n\nBut what we do know is that according to HMIC value for money data, the number of operational front line police officers fell from 114,324 in 2013 to 111,630 in 2015-16.\n\nThis is a decrease of 2,694 front line police officers in three years.\n\nWe know that cuts across the police force in all roles were sharpest in the first few years of Tory government. It\u2019s possible that the decline in front line officers was even more marked between 2010 and 2013, but we don\u2019t have enough reliable data to say conclusively either way.\n\nWould any of the three main parties return police numbers to their 2010 levels?\n\nWith the events of recent weeks, police funding has become one of the defining issues of this election.\n\nLabour have pledged to \u201crecruit an additional 10,000 police officers to work on community beats\u201d, which they estimate will cost \u00a3300 million. This is the biggest increase in officer numbers offered by any of the three parties, although it will only replace half of the officers cut under the Tories.\n\nThe Lib Dem manifesto matches Labour\u2019s funding pledge of \u00a3300 million a year to local police forces, but doesn\u2019t specify how many officers that will translate into.\n\nThe Conservative manifesto doesn\u2019t mention any additional funding or an increase in police officers. It talks about \u201cstrengthening the police and security services\u201d.\n\nJeremy Corbyn is right that the Tories have presided over a fall in police officer numbers of 20,000 since 2010. It\u2019s not clear how many of those are on the front line.\n\nLabour and the Lib Dems have both pledged \u00a3300 million a year to help reverse funding cuts to police budgets. Labour have also promised 10,000 more front line officers, although this would only replace half of the officers cut under the Tories. The Tories haven\u2019t mentioned any specifics in their manifesto.", "lang": "en"}
