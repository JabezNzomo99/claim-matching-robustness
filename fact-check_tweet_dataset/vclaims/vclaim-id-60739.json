That is, for you youngsters, there\u2019s not yet an instant-check app for that.\n\nBut still, if the 2011 ID law put in place by the state\u2019s ruling Republicans was intended to prevent voter impersonation, it\u2019s arguably a twist that there is no ID provision for those who vote by mail.\n\nAs noted by the league, voters going to the polls will be expected to present a photo ID issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (a driver's license, personal ID card, concealed handgun license or election identification certificate) or by the federal government (a passport, military ID or a citizenship or naturalization certificate). The registration deadline for voting in the Nov. 5, 2013, election is Oct. 7.\n\nSo, no photo ID for Texans voting by mail?\n\nBy email, Linda Krefting of Lubbock, who chairs the education fund, pointed out the 2011 law has no provision for photo IDs being presented in connection with balloting by mail. She also pointed out a query and reply on a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" kept by the Texas Secretary of State\u2019s office, which oversees elections:\n\n\" Does the new photo ID requirement apply to voting by mail?\n\n\"A. The new requirement does not change the process for voting by mail.\"\n\nAnother question and answer on the web page delivers more detail, stating that a registered voter wishing to vote early by mail, which is no longer called \"absentee voting,\" may request a mail ballot by meeting any of several conditions. That is, according to the answer, the voter will be out of her or his home county on Election Day and during the early-voting period or the voter is sick or disabled or she or he will be 65 or older on Election Day or confined in jail though still eligible to vote.\n\nof the Texas Election Code further defines \"disabled\"; a disability can include an expectation of being in childbirth on Election Day, for instance. Also, a person in jail can be allowed to vote in person at the discretion of the authority in charge of the jail, the law says.\n\nBy telephone, Alicia Pierce, an office spokeswoman, confirmed that the state voter ID law did not impose photo ID requirements on Texans voting by mail.\n\nBut there is a photo-ID element to federal law, Pierce said, in that a first-time voter who registers to vote without providing either their photo ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number will be asked by county officials to send a copy of their ID if she or he requests a mail ballot.\n\nBy phone, , the Travis County clerk, told us local officials must request a copy of a photo ID of such first-time voters in accord with the federal Help America Vote Act, which took effect in 2006. She said the ID copy must be sent back to the county in the envelope holding, but separate from, the sealed mail-in ballot.\n\nDeBeauvoir emailed us the requesting photo IDs of such voters. Notably, it says that mail-ballot voters are still not required to send a copy of a photo ID if they check a box indicating they are \"disabled, in the military or living overseas.\"\n\nDeBeauvoir said that in the 2012 general election, about 3 percent of the county\u2019s ballots for president were submitted by mail.\n\nA snapshot of current events: In late September 2013, county elections official Michelle Parker told us by phone that 1,767 of the county\u2019s more than 600,000 registered voters--less than 3/10 of 1 percent--had been flagged to possibly be asked for photo IDs should those voters seek to vote by mail in the 2013 elections.\n\nThe league said: \"\"Photo ID is not required for those who vote by mail.\"\n\nThat\u2019s correct for all but first-time voters who did not present a photo ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number when registering to vote. Such voters who seek to vote by mail can expect to be asked for a copy of their photo ID, yet even these voters do not have to do so if they are disabled, in the military or living overseas.\n\nWe see nothing significant missing from this claim and rate it as True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n\nNotice sent to some Travis County voters by mail, (received by email from Dana DeBeauvoir, Sept. 25, 2013)", "lang": "en"}
