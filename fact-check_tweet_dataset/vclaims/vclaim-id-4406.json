Waters\u2019 remarks prompted a controversy of their own, with some critics accusing her of incitement to violence, and Republican Congressman Steve Scalise \u2014 who was shot by an angry left-wing gunman in June 2017 \u2014 was among those who condemned her comments.\n\nOn the heels of this brouhaha came the announcement by Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy of his imminent retirement, paving the way for President Trump to nominate a new justice whose ideological leanings could influence decisions on major issues likely to come before the court in the near future.\n\nA hyperpartisan Facebook page combined these two political controversies in one meme which falsely suggested that Waters had called for an \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d to be appointed as the next U.S. Supreme Court Justice.\n\nOn 28 June 2018, the \u201cTrump Nation\u201d Facebook page posted what appeared to be a screenshot of a CNN interview with Waters, above a chyron reading \u201cWATERS: SCOTUS PICK SHOULD BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT and a ticker seemingly quoting Waters as stating that \u201cIt\u2019s the only way the Democrats can ever win again.\u201d The \u201cTrump Nation\u201d post was accompanied by the comment \u201c\u2026 and this is why WE don\u2019t watch CNN\u2026 They are bat shit crazy! SHARE if you agree \u2026\u201d:\n\nThe image was a fake, however. Waters never called for an \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d to replace Kennedy on the Supreme Court, and the screen capture was digitally altered to falsely make it appear that she did.\n\nThe screenshot appears to have been taken from a 24 October 2017 CNN interview with Waters, in which she explained earlier remarks she had made in which she vowed to \u201ctake Trump out.\u201d The similarities between the original video and the \u201cTrump Nation\u201d meme are obvious, including Waters\u2019 attire and jewelry as well as the cloud formation visible in the background:", "lang": "en"}
