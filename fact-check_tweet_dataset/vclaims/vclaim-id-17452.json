The video further shows the two men, who are also on a motorcycle, intimidating another commuter. The man riding pillion gets off the bike with a gun in his hand while the other starts putting his hands in the pockets of the victims to steal their wallets.\n\nOne Mukesh Patel posted this video on Facebook with the caption, \u201c\u0a06 \u0a26\u0a47\u0a16 \u0a32\u0a4b \u0a38\u0a3e\u0a21\u0a47 \u0a30\u0a3e\u0a1c\u0a2a\u0a41\u0a30\u0a3e \u0a26\u0a3e \u0a39\u0a3e\u0a32,, \u0a36\u0a30\u0a47\u0a06\u0a2e \u0a2a\u0a3f\u0a38\u0a1f\u0a32 \u0a1a\u0a41\u0a71\u0a15\u0a40 \u0a2b\u0a3f\u0a30\u0a26\u0a40 \u0a06 \u0a2e\u0a70\u0a21\u0a40\u0a30 \u0a2a\u0a30\u0a36\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a28 \u0a28\u0a3e\u0a32 \u0a39\u0a3f\u0a71\u0a38\u0a3e \u0a2c\u0a70\u0a28\u0a3f\u0a06 \u0a39\u0a41\u0a70\u0a26\u0a3e,, \u0a24\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a39\u0a40 \u0a07\u0a39 \u0a1f\u0a41\u0a71\u0a1a\u0a42 \u0a1c\u0a3f\u0a39\u0a47 \u0a2c\u0a70\u0a26\u0a47 \u0a32\u0a4b\u0a15\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a28\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a21\u0a30\u0a3e \u0a15\u0a47 \u0a32\u0a41\u0a71\u0a1f \u0a30\u0a39\u0a47 \u0a28\u0a47 \u0a07\u0a39\u0a28\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a28\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a21\u0a30\u0a3e\u0a35\u0a47 \u0a2a\u0a41\u0a32\u0a3f\u0a38 \u0a06\u0a2e \u0a2c\u0a70\u0a26\u0a47 \u0a09\u0a71\u0a24\u0a47 \u0a39\u0a40 \u0a1c\u0a4b\u0a30 \u0a05\u0a1c\u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a07\u0a36 \u0a15\u0a30\u0a28 \u0a35\u0a3e\u0a32\u0a3f\u0a09( Look at the condition of our Rajpura. The boys are walking around openly, with the pistols in their hands. The administration is bribed. This is the reason why such boys are looting the people. The police should scare them and not the public.)\u201d\n\n\n\nPeople have reached out to Alt News asking about the veracity of the claim.\n\nA reverse image search of one of the frames of the video on Google led Alt News to a tweet by Pakistan-based Dawn News. The tweet carried the same video with a caption that used the following hashtags \u2013 #Robbery #Lahore #CCTV.\n\nAnother Pakistan-based media outlet City42 posted a video on their official Twitter handle, giving details of the incident. In its June 26 broadcast, the channel said that the theft took place in Nawab town near Nasheman Iqbal Phase 1 in Lahore, Pakistan. The police are investigating the crime with the help of CCTV footage of the area.\n\nIf one notices the video carefully, the first few seconds show the date and time of the CCTV footage \u2013 June 25, 2019, at 1:41 PM.\n\nIt is commonplace on social media for videos from around the world to be shared as incidents that took place in India. Recently, we debunked videos from Morocco, Palestine, Brazil (1, 2), Tibet, Uganda and Bangladesh.\n\nUPDATE: The title said \u2018bike\u2019 robbery which has been rectified.", "lang": "en"}
