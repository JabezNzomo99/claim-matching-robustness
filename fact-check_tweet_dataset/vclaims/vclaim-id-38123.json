Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is false.\n\nA viral post shared on Facebook reads: Shocking Truth\u2026.Nestle Company accepts that they add juice extracted from Beef in KitKat Chocolate!!\n\nVishvas News investigated and found that the message is in circulation across social media since at least 2015. Furthermore, there are no credible reports confirming that Nestle uses the juice of beef in KitKat chocolate. If any such thing happened, Nestle would have accepted the same.\n\nWe found a report on the website of BBC that, back in 2013, Nestle withdrew two beef pasta meals from shelves in Italy and Spain. It was during a scandal involving the mixing of Horsemeat when Nestle identified the problem with a supplier from Germany.\n\nUsing Twitter Advanced Search, we found a tweet in which Twitter responded that all variants of KITKAT in India are 100% veg. All ingredients are listed on the pack for easy reference.\n\nVishvas News further investigated by visiting the website of KitKat India. The website mentions that all variants of KIT KAT manufactured in India are 100% vegetarian. All the ingredients are clearly listed on the back of pack for reference. In addition, all vegetarian products from Nestl\u00e9 carry the green dot symbol. You can continue enjoying your favorite KIT KAT with absolute confidence.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Nestle, India. The spokesperson of Nestle, India quoted: \u201cThis news is fake.\u201d\n\nAs per Nestle Annual Report 2015, \u201cWith KitKat, Nestl\u00e9 has a strong global player driving performance in both emerging and developed markets. KitKat will become the first global confectionery brand sourced from 100 percent certified sustainable cocoa, starting early in 2016. The brand already uses sustainably sourced cocoa, accredited by independent third-party bodies, in products sold in certain markets, but this new announcement extends the practice worldwide, including the United States.\u201d\n\nThe post claiming that Nestle accepts adding juice of beef in KitKat is fake.", "lang": "en"}
