No, that's not true: First, there is no Article 9 to the U.S. Constiution, which has seven articles. And this is a satirical story created by a website that publishes fake content aimed at a conservative audience.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by DailyWorldUpdate.com on January 30, 2020, titled \"Trump Invokes Article 9 To Begin Prosecution Of Democrats For Treason\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nNot only is there no Article 9, Trump has not taken action to charge Democrats with treason. While the site that first published this story has several labels making it known that it is satirical, many other websites steal th story and republish it without the satire labels - positing it as real news that then gets shared over and over on social media.\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full-time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles.

A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\n'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America November 17 The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news.
