Humanity is over, tarnished Dr's profession.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake-News War room ( AFWA) found the viral claim is misleading. The incident mentioned in the claim is over two years old and has nothing to do with COVID-19.\n\nThe post is viral on Twitter and Facebook as multiple users have shared the same content linking it to Covid-19.\n\nWith the help of the keywords search, we found the same incident was reported by multiple news websites in June, 2018.\n\nAccording to these news reports, Dr. Vibhu Garg of Garg Hospital in the New Mandi area of Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh was booked along with three other hospital staff for allegedly removing a kidney of a 60-year-old patient, without informing the patient party. The family members claimed that they have also found the \"stolen\" kidney, hidden in an ice bag. As per the news reports, the hospital was sealed after the incident.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found the viral images published in a Hindi website called \u201cRoyal Bulletin\u201d on June 23, 2018, along with the same information about the kidney removal allegedly by Dr. Garg in Muzaffarnagar.\n\nRecently, India Today had debunked a same kind of misinformation about organ trading linking to COVID-19.\n\nIt is confirmed that, the viral claim about the Muzaffarnagar \u201ckidney-stealing\u201d incident from a COVID-19 patient is misleading. The incident is from 2018 and has no connection with the pandemic.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Rumours of organ trade under the garb of Covid-19 go viral", "lang": "en"}
