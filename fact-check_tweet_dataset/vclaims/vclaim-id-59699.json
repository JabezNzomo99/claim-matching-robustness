That meme claimed BLM had raised \u201cover a billion dollars\u201d but had not used that money to provide necessities such as food, housing, or schooling; instead, they had expended it on buying \u201chuge charter busses to transport members to riots\u201d:\n\nAs for the first part of the meme, BLM is a \u201cdecentralized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against African-American people\u201d; it isn\u2019t a centrally organized group that was founded for the purpose of feeding the hungry, providing housing, or funding schooling, nor does it raise money on that basis.\n\nMoreover, the photograph accompanying this meme does not show any buses purchased by BLM \u201cto transport members to riots,\u201d or for any other purpose. The vehicles pictured here belong to the Toronto Raptors professional basketball team, who wrapped their buses with the Black Lives Matter name as a show of support for the movement, as documented on the Raptors\u2019 Twitter account:\n\nThe same photograph was used to accompany a CBC article about the Raptors\u2019 arrival at the protected \u201cNBA bubble\u201d training facility at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, where the picture was captioned as follows: \u201cThe reigning NBA champion Toronto Raptors arrived at the Disney campus after a two-hour drive from Naples, Fla., where the team has trained for roughly two weeks. The team\u2019s buses were wrapped with its logo and the words \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 displayed.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
