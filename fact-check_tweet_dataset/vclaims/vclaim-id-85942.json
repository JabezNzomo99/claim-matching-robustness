(Conservatives decry the smaller economy that will result; liberals celebrate that workers will not be bound to their jobs because of health insurance.) But that\u2019s not The Fact Checker\u2019s business. Our concern is whether the CBO\u2019s report is being described correctly by politicians.\n\nThe reason that we don\u2019t use the term \u201clost jobs\u201d is there\u2019s a critical difference between people who like to work and can\u2019t find a job or have a job that was lost for reasons beyond their control and people who choose not to work. If somebody comes up to you and says, \u201cWell, the boss said I\u2019m being laid off because we don\u2019t have enough business to pay me,\u201d that person feels bad about that and we sympathize with them having lost their job. If somebody comes to you and says, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to retire\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve decided to stay home and spend more time with my family\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve decided to spend more time doing my hobby,\u201d they don\u2019t feel bad about it, they feel good about it, and we don\u2019t sympathize. We say congratulations. And we don\u2019t say they\u2019ve lost their job because they have chosen to leave that job.\n\nNow, all things being equal, a reduction of 2 million full-time workers eventually would mean 2 million fewer jobs. But the CBO estimate was a mix of full-time and part-time workers, which result in the hours worked equal to that many full-time workers. But some workers might reduce their weekly hours by only an hour or two, so the impact on overall jobs would be muted.\n\n\u201cWhether faulty government policies drive people to quit work, or if a person is fired, or if a person is not hired in a job they\u2019d otherwise get because companies can\u2019t expand, that is a job that is lost,\u201d said Jordan Shaw, campaign manager for Tillis. \u201cIn many cases, a 2-income family will drop to a 1-income family to stay eligible for subsidies \u2014 that is a \u2018lost\u2019 job due to this policy. The bottom line is that Obamacare costs jobs, and that hurts families, communities, and the economy. Period.\u201d\n\nThe NRSC news release is also an interesting example. The headline actually tries hard to be restrained and relatively accurate. It says that the law will \u201creduce employment\u201d and then carefully notes this is the \u201cequivalent\u201d of a number of jobs. The release further says \u201cfewer people will be employed and fewer hours worked because of the unpopular law.\u201d That\u2019s phrased correctly.\n\nBut that is inherently misleading. Not every state expanded Medicaid, so the effects are different. Indeed, North Carolina is one of those states that did not expand Medicaid, so right away, that means the impact on worker participation will be lower than in other states. Moreover, every state has a different distribution of income, so there can be vast differences in the percentage of people who will be affected by the subsidies for low-income workers and the law\u2019s taxes on the wealthy. That could also significantly change the result, state by state.\n\nBoth the Tillis campaign and ATR fall into the trap of saying a specific number of jobs will be lost. This is not what CBO said, as made clear by Elemendorf\u2019s testimony. For non-economists, the use of the phrase \u201cjobs\u201d is especially confusing because it sounds like the decision made by employers, rather than workers.", "lang": "en"}
