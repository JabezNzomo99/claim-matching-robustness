Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: \u2018Red Mercury\u2019 can be found in old radios and televisions. Fact: \u2018Red Mercury\u2019 is a myth. In 2002 itself, an American official has said that there is no such thing as \u2018Red Mercury\u2019. He also said that some terrorist groups have tried to acquire the mythical \u2018Red Mercury\u2019 and have fallen prey to scams. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched about \u2018Red Mercury\u2019 on the internet, a website link of \u2018U.S. Department of State\u2019 was found in the search results. On the website, the transcript of the speech given by John R. Bolton, then Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security, at \u2018International Approaches to Nuclear and Radiological Security Conference\u2019 \u2013 London in 2002 was found. In his speech, Bolton said that there is no such thing as \u2018Red Mercury\u2019. He also said that some terrorist groups have tried to acquire the mythical \u2018Red Mercury\u2019 and have fallen prey to scams.\n\nThe \u2018BBC\u2019 and \u2018The New York Times\u2019 have also published articles saying that the \u2018Red Mercury\u2019 is a myth. Those articles can be read here and here. In the \u2018BBC\u2019 article, it can be read that there is no chemical such as \u2018Red Mercury\u2019 but there is a red-coloured mercury-containing the ore \u2013 \u2018Mercury Sulphide\u2019. It is harmful \u2018not because it\u2019s highly explosive, but rather because plain old mercury is hazardous to human health\u2019\n\nIn old televisions and other electronics, there is some content of mercury and other harmful chemicals but there is no trace of \u2018Red Mercury\u2019 (at least nobody found it till today). Also, there are various instances in the past where police arrested scammers who tried to dupe people by selling them the non-existent \u2018Red Mercury\u2019. Further information regarding those incidents can be found here, here and here. In 2009, a similar hoax went viral in Saudi Arabia that \u2018Red Mercury\u2019 can be found in old sewing machines.\n\nTo sum it up, \u2018Red Mercury\u2019 in itself is a myth. It cannot be found in old televisions and radios.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
