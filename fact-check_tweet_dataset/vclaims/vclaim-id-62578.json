(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nBecause as Know Your Meme describes in some detail, this photo wasn\u2019t taken during the pandemic. Or even the year before it.\n\nIt was posted on Imgur.com in August 2018 with this text: \"Father forgive them for they know not what they chew.\" And here it is on Reddit two years ago. Someone tweeted it in October 2019.\n\nThis year, it\u2019s still being shared as a joke. \"Personally, I do not agree with McDonald\u2019s policy of crucifying customers who are caught stealing napkins,\" someone wrote. \"But as a private business that owns the storefront property, it is their prerogative & right to do so.\"\n\nThe way it\u2019s presented on Facebook, however, has left users in disbelief.\n\n\"Trumpism at its BEST,\" one commenter said. \"We in a serious pandemic.\"\n\n\"This is utterly ridiculous & so disrespectful,\" someone else said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not true that they\u2019re protesting pandemic-era policies.", "lang": "en"}
