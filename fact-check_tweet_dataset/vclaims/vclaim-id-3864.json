Bowbrick, who identified the pictured creature as a sea pen, a marine invertebrate known as an anthozoan:\n\nThis creature is indeed related to anenomes and the soft corals. Sea Pens \u2014 Pennatulacea They have the ability to pull themselves down into the reef and vanish if threatened. You can see the tube like structure at the base. Hard to see at this size but there are also a number of small cleaner shrimp in the photo close to the central quill of the feather.\n\nThis image has circulated under several variations of the word \u201cnagapushpa,\u201d including Nagapushpam, Naga Pushpa, and Naga Pushpam. Regardless of spelling, these words do not refer to a real Himalayan flower that blooms only once every 36 years. The word nagapuspa is a Sanskrit term for the Mesua ferrea tree (also known as the Ceylon ironwood, Bodhi tree, Indian rose chestnut, or Cobra\u2019s saffron) but this tree is an evergreen and thus does not bloom only once every 36 years either.", "lang": "en"}
