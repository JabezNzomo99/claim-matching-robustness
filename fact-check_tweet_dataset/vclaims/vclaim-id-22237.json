But Arnold says that when she received a failing grade on the assignment (comparing social media use between the U.S. and another country) the instructor explained:\n\nThe instructor reportedly agreed to do \u201cindependent research\u201d on the matter after Arnold referred her to a section of the Australian government\u2019s web site called \u201cAbout Australia\u201d that said \u201cAustralia is an island continent and the world\u2019s sixth largest country (7,682,300 sq km).\u201d\n\nThe instructor later replaced Arnold\u2019s failing grade with a B+. However, the professor reportedly warned her to \u201cmake sure the date, the facts, and the information you provide in your report is about Australia the country and not Australia the continent.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the university told us:\n\nWe deeply regret the interaction between our professor and our student and have apologized to the student and refunded her for the class. Following an investigation, we have replaced the instructor as we strive to adhere to the highest standards of integrity and accuracy in educating our students. To our friends and colleagues in Australia, we know that you are a country and a continent, best of luck in the Olympic games!\n\nWe also contacted Arnold seeking comment, but we had not heard back by press time.", "lang": "en"}
