Soon after Janata Curfew was announced, social media got deluged with various posts interpreting the concept and logic behind Janata Curfew. A post went viral on social media in which it has been claimed that coronavirus life is 8 \u2013 12 hours and Janata Curfew is for 14 hours. It is further claimed that for 12 hours virus will not get in touch with the human body, this will kill the virus. Vishvas News investigation and found that the viral post is misleading.\n\nA viral post on shared on instagram by a user named bhallatanya.16 claims: \u201cThe Logic behind Janata Curfew\u2026As Corona Virus life at one place is 8 \u2013 12 hours and Janata Curfew is for 14 hrs\u2026. so for 12 hours virus will not get in touch with the human body, this will kill the virus.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nDuring the investigation, Vishvas News found a research in The New England Journal of Medicine. As per the study, depending upon the surface the virus is exposed to, it may live for fa ew hours or for 2-3 days. They conducted the study by spraying the virus into the air with the help of a nebuliser creating the environment similar to those observed in samples obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans. They found that it could be detected up to a minimum of 3 hours later in the air, up to 4 hours on copper surfaces, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces.\n\nAs per the study, coronavirus can also be spread through the air.\n\nAs per World Health Organization (WHO), \u201cIt is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).\n\nIf you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.\u201d\n\nThe Janata curfew on March 22, 2020 would decrease the contact among people which will help in avoiding the community spread of the disease to some extent.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Sudeep Khanna of Indraprastha Apollo regarding the viral claim. Here said: \u201cThe survival of Coronavirus on a surface is not known. It is incorrect to say that the virus will die in 8-12 hours.\u201d\n\nAs per WHO official it is not certain that coronavirus persists on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kanupriya Singhal, Health Specialist, UNICEF, \u201cOne should emphasise the importance of washing hands repeatedly and avoid touching the face as much as possible to protect themselves from coronavirus. \u201d\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
