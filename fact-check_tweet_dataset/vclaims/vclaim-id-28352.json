In the post, an article of \u2018The Economic Times\u2019 was also attached. Let\u2019s try to check the veracity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Google CEO Sundar Pichai has stated that NRC and CAB are anti-Muslim. Fact: Sundar Pichai hasn\u2019t stated that NRC and CAB are anti-Muslim. The article in the post is from 2015 and has nothing to do with the recent NRC or CAB. Information from no credible source was found which confirms that Pichai has made such comments. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe post claims that Sundar Pichai has stated that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) are anti-Muslim and also has an article of \u2018The Economic Times\u2019 with the title \u2018Must support Muslims and other minorities: Google CEO Sundar Pichai\u2019. The article is from 2015 and has nothing to do with the recent NRC and CAB. The article is about Sundar Pichai coming out in support of the Muslim community when the then-Republican Presidential hopeful candidate Donald Trump has made comments seeking a ban on entry of Muslims into the US.\n\nWhen searched on Google if Pichai has made the statement claimed in the post, information from no credible source was found which confirms Pichai saying so.\n\nEarlier, when a post went viral saying Sundar Pichai has posted on his Facebook account about changing the Indian Political system, \u2018FACTLY\u2019 has debunked it and the article can be read here.\n\nTo conclude, Google CEO Sundar Pichai hasn\u2019t said NRC and CAB are anti-Muslim. The fake quote is being attributed to him.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
