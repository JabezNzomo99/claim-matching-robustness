The claim is false; the footage was taken during a 2017 protest by teachers in the north Indian state of Haryana.\n\nThe 3:57 clip was streamed as a Facebook live video here on August 23, 2019 and has been viewed more than four million times.\n\nThe accompanying Urdu-language caption reads: \u201cPlease click and share this video. This is the latest video from Kashmir, share it so widely that global powers feel shamed. Be the voice of oppressed Kashmiris.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe video has also been shared elsewhere on Facebook here, here, here and here, on Twitter here and here, and on YouTube here.\n\nThe use of Facebook\u2019s livestream function -- which is designed to broadcast live video -- in the August 23 post is an attempt to claim the footage was filmed after the Indian government abolished the special autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir state on August 5, 2019, leading to widespread protests in the Kashmir valley as described in this AFP report.\n\nBut the footage was actually recorded more than two years ago, and depicts a protest by a group of female teachers elsewhere in India.\n\nThe original video was published here on a Facebook page \u2018Karnal Breaking News\u2019, where it was live streamed on June 11, 2017.\n\nKarnal is a city in India\u2019s Haryana state, well south of Kashmir.\n\nThe video is accompanied by a Hindi language caption which says in part: \u201cWatch live - women police personnel are dragging protesting JBT female teachers and taking them into buses. A large number of JBT teachers were holding a protest demonstration since morning over their demands and shouting slogans against the government.\u201d\n\nKarnal Breaking News published a longer video from the teachers\u2019 protest on their verified YouTube channel here, also on June 11, 2017.\n\nBelow are screenshots of the original video from Karnal Breaking News Facebook page with \u201cHaryana, Karnal\u201d (L) and \u201cPranami Mandir Bus Stop\u201d written on a police vehicle and signboard respectively:\n\nA male voice in the video, speaking in the Hindi language, can be heard saying: \u201cThis is a video of protest demonstration by JBT teachers in front of the chief minister\u2019s camp office.\u201d\n\n\u201cJBT\u201d refers to Junior Basic Training, a two-year diploma course found in the Indian education system.\n\nAFP spoke to Kamal Midha, the editor of Karnal Breaking News website, who confirmed the date and context of the footage.\n\n\u201cThis video is from Karnal in Haryana in June 2017, when JBT teachers were protesting outside chief minister\u2019s camp office. The video uploaded on Facebook with a claim that it is from Kashmir is absolutely false,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nOther news outlets also reported on the 2017 teachers\u2019 protest here and here.", "lang": "en"}
