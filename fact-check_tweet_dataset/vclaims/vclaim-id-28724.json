March 5, 2019.\n\nFederal shadow communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland has blamed the NBN network for Australia\u2019s fall to 60th in the world for fast internet speed. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the claims made by Ms Rowland that the rollout of the NBN has resulted in consumers paying more for a slower and less reliable service.\n\nAAP FactCheck found one of the shadow ministers three claims to be correct. The evidence shows the internet is cheaper and faster since the rollout of the NBN but the service is less reliable.\n\nThe NBN, launched by former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd in 2009, was supposed to supercede Australia\u2019s aging copper-wire asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and cable network. [2]\n\nThe ADSL network connects to the internet and carries data through traditional telephone lines already installed to homes and businesses. These lines weren\u2019t originally intended for anything more than phone calls. [3]\n\nThe cable network supplies the internet through the same coaxial cables that deliver data to your TV set. [4]\n\nAccording to NBN Co Limited - the government-owned corporation tasked to design, build and operate the NBN as a monopoly wholesale broadband provider - the new network will \u201cupgrade\u201d Australia\u2019s existing wholesale landline phone and internet service. The network rollout \u201cis expected to be completed by 2020\u201d. [5]\n\nAAP FactCheck found the claim by Ms Rowland that the rollout of the NBN had resulted in consumers paying more was false.\n\nAccording to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Communications Market Report for 2017\u201318, there has been an annual downward trend in fixed broadband prices since 2014-15. [6]\n\nThe same report for 2014-15 found annual decreases since 2007-08. [7]\n\nThe ACCC\u2019s findings are supported by a decrease in prices for fixed broadband plans offered by provider Internode. In 2010, $50 bought 50 Gb of date with Internode. In 2019, $50 buys double that amount of data. [8]\n\nThe 2017 Australian Digital Inclusion Index reported the cost of data - for both fixed and mobile internet - declined from 2014-2017. This was in line with the ACCC\u2019s price monitoring of telecommunications services which showed an average decline in real terms of 3.1 per cent since 2006. [9]\n\nAAP FactCheck found the claim by Ms Rowland that the NBN had delivered a slower service was false.\n\nUnder the NBN, consumers can purchase different speed plans, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Speed plans range from 12 Mbps to 100 Mbps. [10]\n\nUnder consecutive Liberal prime ministers Tony Abbott (2013-2015) and Malcolm Turnbull (2015-2018), the NBN model of installing fibre optic to the premises nationwide was scaled back to fibre optic to the node (FFTN). Mr Rudd described the node as a \u201cmystical point somewhere in the neighbourhood\u201d. Dr Longxiang Gao, lecturer in computer networks, School of Information Technology at Deakin University described FFTN as \u201cold technology\u201d. [11]\n\n\u201cFTTN runs high-speed fibre optics to boxes on a street corner before delivering internet to the home via copper, and was always going to be a short-term fix,\u201d Dr Gao said. \u201cThe performance of FTTN is really dependent on the location, or put simply, how close a home or business is to the boxes, and has a very slow upload speed. The current NBN speed is already out of date.\u201d [11]\n\nAccording to a State of the Internet Report published before the start of the NBN rollout in 2010 by internet content-distribution giant Akamai, Australia\u2019s average internet speed in January-March 2010 was 2.6 Mbps, ranking Australia 50th in the world. [12]\n\nAccording to the Speedtest Global Index, the new go-to for global broadband speed reporting, Australia was ranked 60th for global broadband speed with an average of 33.28 Mbps in January 2019. The global average download speed was 55.52 Mbps. [13]\n\nThe evidence shows Australia\u2019s average broadband speed has risen since the introduction of the NBN from 2.6 Mbps in 2010 to 33.28 Mbps in 2019. But the rise has not kept pace with better and faster technology available around the world, as demonstrated by Australia\u2019s slide in world rankings from 50th in 2010 to 60th in 2019.\n\nAAP FactCheck found the claim by Ms Rowland that the introduction of the NBN had created a less reliable service was true.\n\nA federal parliamentary Joint Standing Committee report on the NBN dated September 2017 listed reliability and loss of service as a key complaint, with an Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) 2016 research paper titled \u201cMigrating to the NBN - The experience of Australian consumers\u201d saying one in five consumers reported \u201ctheir fixed-internet and landline phone services were less reliable now than before connecting to the NBN\u201d. [14]\n\nA separate ACMA report from August 2018 found seven in 10 consumers (71 per cent for both households and businesses) experienced at least one issue or fault after NBN connection. \u201cThe most frequently mentioned issue or fault was drop-outs (49 per cent). Around one-third of both households and businesses experienced speed issues and service outages.\u201d [15]\n\nA NSW Business Chamber NBN and Telecommunications Survey from March 2018 found there were delays and disruptions with the NBN, with 42 per cent of businesses reporting the NBN was \u201cunreliable\u201d. [16]\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes only one of Ms Rowland's three claims was correct. The evidence shows accessing the internet is less expensive and faster since the rollout of the NBN, but the service is less reliable.", "lang": "en"}
