The tweet has since been deleted, but not before some users had captured images of it.\n\nThe image appeared on Mast\u2019s reelection campaign Twitter feed on Oct. 13, 2019, the 244th anniversary of the American naval force. The flub may have gone mostly unnoticed at any other time in history but for ongoing reports that the Russian government meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nAnd as of Oct. 13, 2019, the day the tweet was posted, Russia was making news in the U.S. for different reasons: U.S. President Donald Trump pulled U.S. forces from northern Syria in what was widely seen as a betrayal of Kurdish allies, and militarily that appeared to play into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kremlin-funded websites RT and Sputnik celebrated the battleship image mix-up.\n\nMast\u2019s campaign spokesman said the error was the result of misleading labeling on the stock image site Shutterstock. The picture of the Pyotr Velikiy available there doesn\u2019t show the ship\u2019s markings and only carries a vague caption that reads, \u201cA warship on the horizon. Rocket cruiser.\u201d Spokesman Brad Stewart said that the picture \u201cwas deleted as soon as the mistake was realized.\u201d\n\n\u201cPyotr Velikiy\u201d translates to Peter the Great. The Soviet-era, nuclear-powered battle cruiser is named for one of the most influential czars who ruled the Russian empire, from 1682 until his death in 1725.\n\nThe account belonging to Mast, a U.S. Army veteran who lost both legs serving in Afghanistan, deleted the picture of the Pyotr Velikiy and then tweeted a video created by the Navy with a similar message commemorating the military branch\u2019s milestone.", "lang": "en"}
