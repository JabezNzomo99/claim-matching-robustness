The Islamic State leader retreated to a tunnel beneath his northwestern Syrian compound and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and two children, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe meme, which includes screen grabs from footage of Lemon and al-Baghdadi, uses the alleged quote to question Lemon\u2019s intelligence. \u201c\u2018Trump killed an unarmed father of three.\u2019 \u2013 Don Lemon of CNN 10/27/2019,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cYes, the idiot really said this on live television.\u201d\n\nOther versions of the claim circulated on Facebook in the form of manipulated CNN chyrons that read \u201cTrump killed an unarmed father of three.\u201d (RELATED: Was Trump Golfing During The al-Baghdadi Raid?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence Lemon ever said the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of CNN transcripts, as well as the video clip editing service Grabien, turned up no matching or similar phrases.\n\nContrary to the meme\u2019s claim, \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d did not air on Oct. 27, the Sunday that Trump announced al-Baghdadi\u2019s death. Lemon\u2019s newscast only airs on weekdays, according to CNN\u2019s programming schedule. A spokeswoman for CNN confirmed to FactCheck.org that Lemon was not on air that day.\n\nLemon called al-Baghdadi and deceased al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden \u201cmurderous terrorists, full stop\u201d during the \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d broadcast Oct. 28.", "lang": "en"}
