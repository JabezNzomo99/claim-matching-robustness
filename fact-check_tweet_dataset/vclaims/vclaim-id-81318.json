(We also got a number of tweets about the statements.) The president\u2019s comments came as part of a long answer in response to a question concerning programs to keep youth off the streets and away from gun violence.\n\nWe got some push-back from the administration on this interpretation so just to be sure, we surveyed six colleagues and asked them what they thought the quote meant. The result was unanimous: the president was telling students the United States had the highest homicide rate among the industrialized world.\n\nThe best proxy for \u201cindustrialized countries\u201d is the membership of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. There are currently 34 countries in the OECD, but the agency also includes Brazil and Russia in its statistical data. (The two countries have been negotiating for membership but talks have been suspended with Russia because of the Crimea crisis.)\n\nSo the United States certainly has a rate that is above average\u2014and indeed, countries such as Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom all have homicide rates that are well below 1 per 100,000. But the president said that U.S. rate was higher \u201cby a mile\u201d when in fact the rate is five times lower than Brazil and four times lower than Mexico.\n\nUpdate: Some readers objected to the idea of Mexico (or Brazil and Russia) as being considered industrialized countries. If one uses instead the OECD \u201chigh-income\u201d list, then those countries would drop off the list. But that still leaves Chile in a tie with the United States, and Estonia close behind. So we still do not see support for the president\u2019s \u201cmile\u201d statement.\n\nThis is just a very strange comment that appears to have no statistical basis. Perhaps one can just shrug it off as hyperbole, but is this really something the president of the United States should say to college students? As far as we know, there are no areas in the United States where background checks are needed to buy vegetables.\n\nUpdate: Some readers have suggested the president was actually referring the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s \u201cfood desert\u201d locator, which shows areas of the countries in which it is difficult to buy fresh vegetables. That\u2019s an interesting interpretation that puts the president\u2019s comment in a different light. Not all gun sales require background checks, we should note. For what it is worth, the White House declined to provide an explanation for the president\u2019s comment on vegetables and guns.\n\nFor instance, Georgia in 2014 approved a law that allowed firearms to be carried into bars and restaurants (unless the owner objected), but there was little if any discussion that the purpose was to allow machine guns in bars. The goal was to allow for hand guns and long rifles in bars and other public places.\n\nSimilarly, while there have been proposals to allow guns in schools, particularly college campuses, the proposals do not specifically address kindergarten. (A bill under consideration in Florida would allow some school personnel to carry guns, provided it is approved by school administrators. It would be limited to former or current law enforcement or military personnel and they must receive training at law-enforcement academies.)\n\n\u201cWhile it may be an exaggeration to say laws have been proposed to allow machine guns in bars it is not an exaggeration to say the same about guns in kindergartens,\u201d Whittenburg said, pointing to bills in 17 states to allow guns in K-12 schools.\n\nThe Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which supports gun restrictions, says \u201cthe vast majority of states \u2013 48 of them \u2013 and the District of Columbia generally prohibit any person from carrying a firearm onto or possessing a firearm on school property, within safe school or gun-free school zones, on school-provided transportation, or at certain school-sponsored events.\u201d Most states also require the expulsion of students who bring firearms onto school property, the groups says.\n\nThe president was playing fast and loose with his language here\u2014to a group of college students no less. There\u2019s little excuse for the claim that in some neighborhoods, it is easier to buy a gun than vegetable (see update above) \u2014 or to say he\u2019s \u201cnot exaggerating\u201d when he claims that some people have proposed laws that would allow machine guns in bars.", "lang": "en"}
