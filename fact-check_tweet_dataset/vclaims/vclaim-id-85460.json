This particular claim called for a deeper look, especially with the Trump administration\u2019s insistence that coal jobs and mines are coming back. Trump then repeated the claim a week later.\n\nThe new mines that are scheduled to open, including in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, are ones that will produce metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel. This coal is used to produce coke, which is then used to blast the furnace to create metal. It\u2019s different from thermal coal, which is burned for steam to produce heat and electricity.\n\nThe increased demand for steel and metallurgical coal from China has raised prices worldwide. U.S. coal companies are now emerging from bankruptcy, and some of them are going public with new investors. And the United States now has a coal-friendly administration, with a president looking to push for an infrastructure deal that could increase the domestic demand for steel.\n\nAnd earlier this year, Cyclone Debbie damaged the supply chains in Australia, the world\u2019s largest exporter of metallurgical coal. That left China, the world\u2019s biggest producer of steel and largest importer of metallurgical coal, scrambling for new sources \u2014 including the United States. (Interestingly: The Australian Bureau of Meteorology attributed the threat of more frequent and intense cyclones to climate change, according to the Daily Beast.)\n\nWhat do these metallurgical mines have to do with the Paris accord? \u201cNot a whole lot, except that the politics get mixed in. The Paris agreement was actually working more aggressively to curtail thermal coal use for the coal plants. There is some concern about metallurgical coal, but not much. But the coal trade itself is a huge part of the Paris agreement,\u201d said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis, which is supported by liberal philanthropies.\n\nBefore the slight uptick in early 2017, U.S. coal jobs and production in 2016 fell to the lowest level in four decades. The demand for electricity-producing coal continues to decline, while natural gas is becoming cheaper and easier to produce, thanks to the fracking boom. In fact, Gary Cohn, chairman of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, recently acknowledged that \u201ccoal doesn\u2019t even make that much sense anymore as a feedstock\u201d due to the rise of natural gas. (For more, read our colleague Steven Mufson\u2019s great article on the industry\u2019s challenges for achieving long-term profitability.)\n\nTrump said the Paris agreement \u201ceffectively blocks the development of clean coal in America,\u201d but the nonbinding, voluntary agreement allows each country to decide the method and technology it wants to use to curb carbon emissions. \u201cClean coal\u201d is rhetoric often used to describe carbon capture and storage, a technique to capture carbon emissions from power plants, transport it through pipelines and inject it deep into the ground to make oil wells more productive.\n\nSince the United States signed on to the Paris agreement in 2015, this technology has continued to develop in the United States. But it remains expensive and not viable economically without being linked to an enhanced oil recovery project. The first large-scale \u201cclean coal\u201d facility was declared operational in January in Texas. A second coal plant in Mississippi using carbon-capture technology was expected to open the same month, but was delayed and has not yet opened. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s budget proposal would shrink funding for research on carbon capture and carbon storage technology.\n\nHe referred to new mines opening up, but the projects he referred to are for a specific type of coal that is used to produce steel, not electricity. The Paris deal focuses on carbon emissions from electricity-generating coal, not metallurgical coal. Demands in metallurgical coal aren\u2019t affected by the Paris agreement or U.S. federal policies; international market prices and fluctuations have led to the recent increased demand. Moreover, the specific factory he refers to had plans to open since September, two months before the election.", "lang": "en"}
