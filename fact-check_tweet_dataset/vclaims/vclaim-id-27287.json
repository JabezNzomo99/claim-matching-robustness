Robert E. Lee.\n\nWalt Heinecke, a professor at the University of Virginia, told Moyer that he received a \u201cspecial events certificate of approval\u201d for events at McGuffey Park and Justice Park \u2014 sites blocks from Emancipation Park, where white nationalists had a permit for a Saturday rally. A car allegedly driven by James Alex Fields Jr. rammed into counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman, on Fourth Street, which runs adjacent to Justice Park.\n\nCharlottesville spokeswoman Miriam I. Dickler told Moyer that only one permit was issued for Emancipation Park \u2014 the one received by white nationalists staging the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally. However, counterprotesters did not need permits to protest that rally, she said.\n\n\u201cPlease bear in mind that people do not need a permit to enter a public park, even when another event is scheduled to take place there, nor are they required to have one to be on streets or sidewalks adjacent to or outside the park,\u201d Dickler said in an email.\n\nAt one point, the president appeared to refer to a march the night before the death at the main rally. \u201cThere were people in that rally, and I looked the night before,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look, they were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.\u201d\n\nOn Friday night, about 250 white nationalists carrying torches marched and chanted anti-Semitic slogans on the U-Va. campus, where they encountered about 30 students who had locked arms around the base of a statue of Thomas Jefferson, according to a Washington Post timeline. Brief clashes took place, resulting in some injuries. U-Va. allows access to open spaces, and so permits were not required for such marches, according to a statement by U-Va. President Teresa A. Sullivan condemning the \u201cintimidating and abhorrent behavior displayed by the alt-right protestors.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, when the major violence occurred, people started gathering in Emancipation Park. Charlottesville Police Chief Al S. Thomas Jr. told The Post the white-nationalist groups went back on a plan that would have kept them separated from the counterprotesters. The two sides started clashing, and by 11:22 a.m. police had declared an unlawful assembly.\n\n\u201cI think what the president is trying to say is that counterprotesters did not have a permit to be in Emancipation Park,\u201d Heinicke said. \u201cThat\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d He added: \u201cEither way you cut it, the president got it wrong.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump twice claimed that counterprotesters lacked a permit to demonstrate in Charlottesville. But they did have permits for rallies on Saturday \u2014 and they did not need one to go into or gather near Emancipation Park, where white nationalists scheduled their rally. No permits were needed to march on the U-Va. campus on Friday night. The president earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
