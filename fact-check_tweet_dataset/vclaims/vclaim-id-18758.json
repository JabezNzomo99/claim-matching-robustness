And so \u2014 and despite that \u2014 you know, if you look \u2014 I guess you could call it normalized, but if you look, our economy is doing fantastically, and if you take a look at the previous administration, they weren\u2019t paying interest. They had no interest rates, they had loosening, not tightening, and frankly it\u2019s a big difference.\u201d\n\nTrump consistently appears jealous that the Fed kept interest rates near zero during the Obama administration. Obama, of course, faced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, with unemployment reaching 10 percent. The economy is now basically at full employment. Zero percent interest rates would mean the economy was again in a free fall \u2014 presumably not something Trump wants.\n\n\u201cIn the last three downturns, the Fed cut the fed-funds rate by five percentage points, 4.8 percentage points, and 5.3 percentage points,\u201d noted prominent economist Martin Feldstein at the time. \u201cBut with a starting level of 2%, it could reduce the federal-funds rate by only two percentage points before hitting zero.\u201d (Feldstein died in June.) He also noted that extremely low interest rates can destabilize the economy, with businesses taking on excessive debt and bankers lending to lower-quality borrowers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about indexing for a long time, and many people like indexing, and it can be done very simply, it can be done directly by me. And so we\u2019ve been looking at that. As you probably have heard, I can do it directly.\u201d\n\nTrump suggests he can order the indexing of capital gains for inflation without an act of Congress. (This would reduce taxes for people who hold stocks for long term.) But Attorney General William P. Barr, when he served in the same post during the George H.W. Bush administration, studied the issue and concluded that a president could not do it on his own: \u201cThe question was clear, can we, simply through administrative action, index capital gains? \u2026 Not only did I not think we could, I did not think that a reasonable argument could be made to support that position,\u201d Barr said in 1993.\n\n\u201cSo it was the G-8 for a long time, and now it\u2019s the G-7, and a lot of the time we talk about, we talk about Russia \u2014 we\u2019re talking about Russia cause I\u2019ve gone to numerous G-7 meetings, and I guess President Obama, because Putin outsmarted him \u2014 President Obama thought it wasn\u2019t a good thing to have Russia in, so he wanted Russia out. \u2026 For most of the time, it was the G-8, it included Russia, and President Obama didn\u2019t want Russia in because he got outsmarted.\u201d\n\nThis is false. Russia was ousted from the Group of Eight (G-8) because of the invasion and annexation of Crimea, with the rest of the group of industrialized democracies saying the act was inconsistent with the \u201cshared beliefs\" of the G-8. There had been 22 meetings of the G-7 before Russia was invited to join by then-President Bill Clinton. Then Russia attended 17 meetings before it invaded Crimea. The G-7 meeting in France later this month will be the sixth since Russia was removed. So it\u2019s incorrect to say \u201cmost of the time\u201d the group included Russia.\n\nTrump, in complaining about what he perceives as hard-nosed negotiating by the European Union, greatly inflates the number of German cars imported to the United States. About 300,000 BMWs and 350,000 Mercedes are sold in the United States each year \u2014 and more than one-quarter of German vehicles sold here are made in the United States, in factories in Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina.\n\n\u201cYour statement about, \u2018Oh, will we fall into a recession for two months,\u2019 Okay? The fact is, somebody had to take China on. My life would be a lot easier if I didn\u2019t take China on. But I like doing it because I have to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, she starts with tears \u2014 tears. And I don\u2019t buy it \u2014 I don\u2019t buy it. I don\u2019t buy it for a second, because I\u2019ve seen her in a very vicious mood at campaign rallies \u2014 my campaign rallies \u2014 before she was a congresswoman. I said, \u2018Who is that?\u2019 And I saw a woman that was violent and vicious and out of control, and all of a sudden, I see this person who\u2019s crying because she can\u2019t see her grandmother.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
