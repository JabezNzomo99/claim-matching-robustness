The report further claimed that scientists had fully decoded the coronavirusgenome and that this information would help track the spread of the virus and assist in developing a vaccine.\n\nThe claim that Russia produced the first high-quality photos is false.\n\nIn fact, the Russians were nearly a month late. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Rocky Mountain Laboratories (in Hamilton, Montana) produced the first images of the virus, taken with an electron microscope, on Feb. 11.\n\nThe institute posted the photos on its public Flickr account.\n\nThe claim that Russian scientists had fully decoded the virus\u2019 genome is a little less clear. On March 17, two days before the Channel One story ran, scientists with the San Diego-based Scripps Research Institute announced they had run an analysis of the virus\u2019 genome and determined it has a natural origin.\n\nScientists from Australia and the U.K. were among the contributing authors to that paper. Still, it is possible Russian scientists completed their own analysis of the genome around the same time.\n\nAs of March 23, Russia had 438 reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, with one death.", "lang": "en"}
