{"title": "More people have probably been killed by coronavirus than were killed during the Blitz", "subtitle": "An image being shared online is a fair reflection of what we know about the death tolls from Covid-19 and the Blitz.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-56057", "url": "https://fullfact.org/online/deaths-coronavirus-blitz/", "vclaim": "More people have probably been killed by coronavirus than were killed during the Blitz\n\nAn image that\u2019s been shared over a thousand times on Facebook claims that the \u201cofficial death toll\u201d from the coronavirus pandemic in the UK now equals the death toll from the Blitz during the Second World War. The widely-shared image was posted on 8 June.\n\nFrom what we\u2019ve seen, at the time the image was posted, the government\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d published count of Covid-19 deaths was slightly under the number of deaths during the Blitz, although the numbers are very similar.\n\nGiven that the death count published by the government is likely to underestimate the total number of deaths related to the virus, the claim if anything understates the reality, which is that there are probably more deaths related to the virus now than the number of people killed during the Blitz.\n\nIn addition, the image in the post accurately depicts a scene from Kensington, London, after a bombing raid in 1940.\n\nThe Blitz was a period of bombing attacks on Britain by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War, and lasted between September 1940 and May 1941.\n\nEstimates of the number of people killed range from between 40,000 and 43,000 people, and the higher of these seems the more precise.\n\nThe government\u2019s official figure for the number of people who\u2019ve died having tested positive for coronavirus in the UK is 42,647 at time of writing, and was around 41,000 as at 8 June, when this image was posted. This is the count since the start of March, so it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that the deaths so far following positive Covid-19 tests have taken place over more than three months, while the Blitz lasted closer to eight.\n\nDeaths during bombing raids aren\u2019t countable in quite the same way as deaths attributable to a disease. There\u2019s some complexity over how you attribute people\u2019s deaths wholly or partly to Covid-19, for example, because people may have other conditions which contribute towards their death.\n\nNevertheless the true number of people who\u2019ve died with Covid-19 is likely to be higher than this, as not everyone with the disease is tested. Alternative estimates look at the overall number of \u201cexcess deaths\u201d\u2014how many more people have died recently than the average number of deaths for this time of year, based on an average of previous year\u2019s figures.\n\nThose figures suggest closer to 60,000 people may have died, directly or indirectly, as a result of the pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
