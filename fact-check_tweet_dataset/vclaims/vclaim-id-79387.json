Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photos of the Kali idol that was burned by the Muslims in West Bengal. Fact: Photos in the post shows the burned idol of Kali temple in Alampur village of Murshidabad district in West Bengal. The temple authority had clarified that on \u201831 August 2020\u2019, the idol in the temple had caught fire in an accident. They said that these photos are shared on social media giving a non-existent communal colour. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn reverse image search, we found the same photos in a tweet posted by BJP MP Ashok Singh with a claim that Muslims in West Bengal burnt Kali idol in Murshidabad. In response to this tweet, Murshidabad police said the claim made in the post is not true. West Bengal Police through their official twitter account stated that the post by MP Ashok Singh is misleading.\n\nIn a tweet posted by Murshidabad Police, it is mentioned that the Secretary of Kali Matha temple in Alampur clarified that there is no communal angle in the accident that took place in the temple. In the tweet, they shared the screenshot of the Facebook post made by the temple secretary Shukdev Bajpayee. In his post on Facebook, the secretary of the temple clarified that on \u201831 August 2020\u2019, the idol of Kali matha in the temple had caught fire in an accident. He also mentioned in his post that the relation between Hindu and Muslim communities was harmonious in their village. He also said that these photos are shared on social media giving a non-existent communal colour.\n\nMurshidabad police shared a video of Shuhdev Bajpayee explaining in details about this accident in Kali temple.\n\nTo sum it up, photos of the Maa Kali idol that caught fire in an accident are falsely shared giving a communal colour.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
