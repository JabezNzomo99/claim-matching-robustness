No, that's not true: the story was made up by a liberal satire website that loves to create fictional stories guaranteed to please republicans and Trump supporters. The aim of the site is to get them to share this fake news so fans of the site can then mock them for it online. The protest is not real, it did not happen, and the local news source that supposedly reported it, The Beaverton Gazette, does not exist.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on September 11, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: 5,000 People Dump Shoes In Front Of Nike Headquarters\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nNike has been making Americans really mad by hiring football washout Colin Kaepernick to be the face of their \"Just Do It\" campaign. But we doubt anyone expected Americans to be this furious with the shoe company. On Monday, around 4,997 people showed up to Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon to dump their products at the un-American company's doorstep. The Beaverton Gazette reports: \"Approximately 5,000 people came to Nike world headquarters to dispose of their shoes - a protest apparently spurred by the company's decision to hire former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for their 2018 Just Do It ad campaign.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe image illustrating the story already appeared back in 2009 in a story about a shoe recycling program run by Nike:\n\nThe site that initially published the hoax comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes trumpbetrayed.us as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
