The incident had occurred on June 25 in Dhar district where the 21-year-old was reportedly thrashed for eloping with a Dalit man and refusing to marry a man from her community.\n\nAmong the first claims used to circulate the video was one which blamed \u201csaffron terrorism\u201d for the attack. In the video, a man can be seen wearing a saffron-coloured scarf with religious inscription.

The incident, however, took place in Madhya Pradesh and had nothing to do with either \u201csaffron terrorists\u201d or members of the Muslim community.\n\nUP police clarified that the attack happened in MP\u2019s Dhar district and that the police have begun legal proceedings against the perpetrators.\n\nIn a conversation with Alt News, Dhar SP Aaditya Pratap Singh rubbished social media claims. \u201cThe woman had eloped with a man from a different community. When she returned, her family wanted her to get married to a man from her community. When she refused, she was beaten by her relatives. Four have been arrested and three others have fled to Gujarat. They will soon be taken into custody,\u201d he said.\n\nThe incident was widely reported in mainstream media.\n\nIt is commonplace on social media for the truth to be twisted and presented in a provocative manner. Any claim that rouses passion should be cross-checked with credible media reports.", "lang": "en"}
