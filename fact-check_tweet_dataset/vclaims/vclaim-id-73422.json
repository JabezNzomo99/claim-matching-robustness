Time and again, social media has highlighted the lack of medical facilities for the needy.\n\nMore recently, a picture showing a patient lying on a hospital bed and holding the glucose drip by his feet is going viral. The drip, injected to his body, is not even attached to the bed and the patient holds it in an elevated position by taking the support of the wall. Social media users say this is the condition of government hospitals in Kashmir.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the photo to be false. The picture is more than four years old and from Egypt.\n\nOn August 7, Facebook page \u201cKashmir youth power\u201d posted the image with a sarcastic caption saying, \u201cWelcome to Kashmir government hospitals\u201d. Till the filing of this article, the post was shared over 2,000 times. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nThe post has gone viral on Facebook.\n\nWith the help of multiple reverse searches, we found that the picture has been used by several Arabic websites before. Many of them said the picture is from Egypt.\n\nIn August 2016, an Arabic website \u201cdostor.org\u201d used this picture in an article and wrote it is viral on Facebook, with users asserting that the image is from Egypt. A verified Twitter handle had also tweeted this image in August 2016, saying it is from Egypt.\n\nHaytham Abokhalil, the above Twitter user, is a TV presenter and human rights activist in Egypt. We reached out to him to further verify the picture. He confirmed that it is an old image from Egypt.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Freedom and Justice Party had also used the picture on its website to highlight the condition of healthcare in the country.\n\nWe could not find the exact location of the picture, but it is confirmed that it is more than four years old and not from Kashmir but Egypt.", "lang": "en"}
