Let\u2019s see, the unemployment rate is up and credit is tight, but does the city have too much housing?\n\n \n\n To the Truth-O-Meter!\n\n \n\n Adrean said the statement is based on conversations she\u2019s had with friends in the real estate\n\n business and articles she\u2019s read in the local media, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\n \n\n She said she meant that the demand for office as well as residential properties was lower than the inventory.\n\n \n\n \"I would love to be wrong,\" Adrean told PolitiFact.\n\n \n\n Bill Adams, president of Adams Realtors, said there are a few specific examples of an oversaturated market within the city. A few neighborhoods in the city, such as Vine City, have been\n\n hit hard by foreclosures and as a result have a glut of housing. Likewise, the Buckhead\n\n condominium market is clearly overbuilt.\n\n \n\n But he said that\u2019s not what\u2019s holding back the broader real estate market.\n\n \n\n \"We\u2019re not like a suburban county that had vast acres of housing built,\" Adams said. \"I think\n\n mostly it\u2019s a result of buyers sitting on the sidelines.\"\n\n \n\n Potential home buyers, many of whom are worried about job security, don\u2019t want to take on\n\n additional debt and instead are waiting until the economy stabilizes, he said. Banks, in some cases, have made it tougher to borrow money. All of it creates a critical mass that spells trouble for the Atlanta housing market.\n\n \n\n Housing sales data collected by Adams show the average sale price for some neighborhoods, such as Inman Park, an upscale neighborhood of tree-lined sidewalks and expensive Victorian housing, are higher than last year. But prices continue to decline in other areas.\n\n \n\n And last year there was a greater incentive to buy because many people were trying to take advantage of the federal housing tax credit before it expired.\n\n \n\n SmartNumbers analyst Steve Palm said the city does have an overabundance of depressed\n\n housing.\n\n \n\n The city currently has 6,000 houses for sale under $50,000, Palm said. And in the last year and a half 24,760 houses sold for less than $50,000.\n\n \n\n \"We have a lot of vacant homes,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Even so, Palm said the city does not have too many houses on the market.\n\n \n\n \"Our inventory is way down,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Some economists speculate that a lot of people are keeping their properties off the market unless they absolutely have to sell them. That also lowers inventory.\n\n \n\n The current housing inventory is about 40 percent lower than 2007 levels, Palm said.\n\n \n\n If the number of closings for the metro area -- precise numbers for the city proper are hard to come by -- remained stable and there were no additional houses added to the market, it would take 8.7 months to sell off all the houses in the metro area, he said At the peak of the housing boom it would have taken about 14 months to sell off all available housing in the metro area.\n\n \n\n This is partly the result of a slowdown in new housing construction, he said. New construction is down 90 percent from the peak years.\n\n \n\n Bill Murray, the managing broker with Prudential Georgia Realty, agrees there is little new housing\n\n and points out that the population of Atlanta is growing, albeit slowly. Census numbers for the city are disputed, but it\u2019s generally agreed the city\u2019s population has increased over the past 10 years.\n\n \n\n This would suggest the city\u2019s problem is not an oversupply of housing.\n\n \n\n But Murray said an explosion of foreclosures has helped create an inventory larger than demand.\n\n \n\n This is why it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market, he said, so in that sense Adrean has a good point.\n\n \n\n This was a tough one for the old Truth-O-Meter. Adrean\u2019s statement does not apply to some\n\n popular intown neighborhoods and new housing starts are few and far between even as the city\u2019s\n\n population continues to inch up, but demand is still low.\n\n \n\n The councilwoman is not wrong, but she\u2019s not totally right either.\n\n \n\n Her statement is accurate but leaves out important details. That\u2019s our definition of Half True.", "lang": "en"}
