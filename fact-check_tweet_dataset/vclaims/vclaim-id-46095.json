Bernie Sanders\u2019 decision to suspend his presidential campaign. They claim he is \u201cstill in the race.\u201d While he remains on Democratic primary ballots, Sanders has said winning is \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d and \u201cthe campaign ends.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders ended his fight for the Democratic presidential nomination on April 8, tweeting, \u201cToday I am suspending my campaign.\u201d But some of his supporters aren\u2019t ready to let go.\n\nMany have taken to social media to suggest that \u201cnews sources are twisting words\u201d by reporting that Sanders had \u201cdropped out.\u201d These claims appear to stem from confusion about Sanders\u2019 message and what it means to suspend a campaign.\n\nOne such post says: \u201cthis is what we call \u2018propganda.\u2019 bernie sanders suspends his campaign AKA he wont spend money advertising himself anymore (bc he wants to help with the pandemic) but he\u2019s still in the race. news sources JUMP on the fact that he\u2019s stopped campaigning to tell everyone \u2018WHOOPS he dropped out!'\u201d\n\nLike other similar posts, it gets some of the details right. But the larger message that Sanders has not dropped out, or the claim that he has dropped out is media propaganda, is wrong.\n\nHere are the facts:\n\nSanders announced in a video message on April 8 that \u201cthe path toward victory is virtually impossible\u2026 I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful.\u201d\n\nHe congratulated former Vice President Joe Biden, now the presumptive nominee, and committed to work with him.\n\nIn a message accompanying the video on Twitter, Sanders\u2019 account said, \u201cwhile the campaign ends, the struggle for justice continues on.\u201d\n\nSanders will stay on the ballot in the remaining primary elections so that he can continue to collect delegates in an effort to impact the party\u2019s platform.\n\n\u201cWhile Vice President Biden will be the nominee,\u201d he said in the video, \u201cwe must continue working to assemble as many delegates as possible at the Democratic convention where we will be able to exert significant influence over the party platform.\u201d\n\nAs of April 13, Sanders had 918 delegates to Biden\u2019s 1,228.\n\nSo, Sanders has ended his campaign for the nomination, but still welcomes support for his platform.\n\nBy suspending his campaign, Sanders \u201cis dropping out of the race for the nomination, but hoping to be active in other party functions,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who researches the presidential nomination system.\n\nThat\u2019s not an unusual move, Kamarck said, noting that Sen. Ted Cruz made a similar decision to amass delegates in order to affect the Republican Party platform after he dropped out of the 2016 primary.\n\nDespite that recent history, President Donald Trump told reporters during a press briefing the day Sanders made his announcement:\n\nDonald Trump, April 8: Well, he didn\u2019t really drop out. He didn\u2019t really \u2014 what about his delegates? I mean, he \u2014 he said he\u2019s going to keep his delegates and \u2014 which is sort of interesting. He\u2019s going to keep his delegates, and he\u2019d like to get more now. Now, is he dropping out or not? That\u2019s not dropping out. When you keep your delegates and then you want more delegates before you get to the convention, that\u2019s a weird deal going on there. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\n\nBut Sanders was clear, saying in the video: \u201cI cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win.\u201d\n\nSanders then went on the following week to endorse Biden for president. In a live stream with Biden, Sanders said: \u201cSo, today, I\u2019m asking all Americans \u2014 I\u2019m asking every Democrat, I\u2019m asking every independent, I\u2019m asking a lot of Republicans \u2014 to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
