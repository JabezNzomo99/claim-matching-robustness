Maxine Waters suggested without evidence that unsubstantiated allegations of \u201csex actions\u201d made in a dossier against President Donald Trump are \u201cabsolutely true.\u201d\n\nThe allegations that Waters referred to were made in a dossier compiled by a former British intelligence officer on alleged ties between Trump and Russia. BuzzFeed News published the full document online on Jan. 10, but explained that it was \u201cunverified.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC on March 9, host Ali Velshi told Waters that her Democratic colleague, Rep. Adam Schiff, wanted Chris Steele, the author of the dossier, to testify before the House committee investigating possible links between Trump and Russia.\n\nVelshi then asked Waters if she believed any of the dossier\u2019s claims. In response, she said that \u201cwe already know the part about the coverage that they have on him with sex actions is supposed to be true.\u201d\n\nWaters then added: \u201cThey have said that that\u2019s absolutely true.\u201d\n\nVelshi, March 9: Your colleague, Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat on the House panel investigating Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia says he\u2019s seeking testimony of a former British spy, who wrote an unsubstantiated dossier of alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Russia. Do you believe anything about that dossier? Waters: Oh, I think it should be taken a look at. I think they should really read it, understand it, analyze it, and determine what\u2019s fact, what may not be fact. We already know that the part about the coverage that they have on him with sex actions is supposed to be true. They have said that that\u2019s absolutely true. Some other things they kind of allude to. Yes, I think he should go into that dossier and see what\u2019s there. Velshi: You say you know, you think them to be true. How are we all going to find out what is true and what isn\u2019t true? I mean, does it help that you think so? Because unless you have information that we don\u2019t have, that\u2019s an allegation. Waters: Yeah, but you understand that I am saying the investigations must be done. The drilling down must be done. We must get to the facts of what it has been about. I don\u2019t think you can do the impeachment just because I think or others think. But I think that if we do the investigations, that we will find the connections and I do think that impeachment will be necessary.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear who Waters meant by \u201cthey,\u201d but it isn\u2019t true that the sex allegations against Trump have been substantiated.\n\nThe first page of the dossier says that Russia has \u201ccompromised Trump through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him,\u201d and refers to \u201cperverted sexual acts,\u201d including an incident involving prostitutes that purportedly occurred at a Russian hotel in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe Moscow Ritz Carlton episode involving Trump reported above was confirmed by Source E,\u201d the dossier says, although information about the source is redacted.\n\nIn an email to FactCheck.org, Waters\u2019 congressional office confirmed that she was \u201creferring to this section of the dossier and saying that she would support an investigation into the redacted source and the information they provided as part of the broader House Intelligence investigation into potential ties between Trump associates and Russian operatives during the 2016 presidential election.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t talking about anything that\u2019s not already in the public domain,\u201d the email said.\n\nBut Waters went beyond \u201csaying that she would support an investigation into the redacted source and the information they provided.\u201d She suggested that the dossier\u2019s claims about Trump\u2019s \u201csex actions\u201d were \u201cabsolutely true,\u201d when, in fact, the claims are unsubstantiated. She offered no evidence, either.\n\nTrump dismissed the dossier\u2019s assertions on Twitter and during a Jan. 11 press conference. \u201cDoes anyone really believe that story?\u201d Trump asked reporters. \u201cI\u2019m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me,\u201d he said, alluding to the more obscene charges.\n\nThe dossier reportedly had been circulating for months, but mainstream news organizations could not independently confirm the allegations and opted not to write about them until they \u201cwere summarized and included alongside a highly classified report assembled by the nation\u2019s intelligence services,\u201d as the Washington Post wrote.\n\nCNN, which broke the story that the four top U.S. intelligence officials had briefed Trump and former President Barack Obama about the dossier, said that it was \u201cnot reporting on details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations.\u201d\n\nEven BuzzFeed News, which made the controversial decision to publish the memos online in full, made clear at the time that the dossier\u2019s charges hadn\u2019t been verified.\n\nAnd when CNN reported in February that U.S. investigators had \u201ccorroborated some of the communications\u201d mentioned in the dossier, its story said that only \u201crelates to conversations between foreign nationals.\u201d\n\nThe CNN story said that \u201cnone of the newly learned information relates to the salacious allegations in the dossier.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
