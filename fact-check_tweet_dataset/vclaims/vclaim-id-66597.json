Did DeKalb\u2019s fund balance \u2013 the budget jargon for the reserves \u2013 really swell from nothing to a projected $57.5 million in four years?\n\nSuch a financial turnaround would be a much needed boost to the county, where suspended CEO Burrell Ellis is about to be retried on charges he extorting campaign cash from companies that do work for the county.\n\nIn the two years since the initial indictment, a county commissioner has begun serving a 14-month sentence for defrauding taxpayers of more than $100,000, a former member of the county\u2019s Zoning Board of Appeals pleaded guilty in February to taking a bribe for his vote and the former county school superintendent pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction in a racketeering case.\n\nIn the midst of that, the county also has struggled financially.\n\nThe net value of all taxable property in DeKalb County tumbled from $24 billion in 2010 to $21 billion in 2011, according to the county\u2019s consolidation sheets.\n\nWhen the county revealed it had spent all of its rainy day fund to make ends meet in 2011, national bond rating agencies took note.\n\nThe agencies downgraded DeKalb\u2019s credit score, meaning taxpayers paid higher interest rates on borrowing for major projects.\n\nAs recently as November 2013, Fitch Ratings said it still had concerns about the depleted reserves even as the county slowly tried to rebuild them.\n\nCounty audits show the slow growth, including adjustments made in 2014 when the county switched its reserve accounting from cash on hand to modified accrual, so that all bills were paid with funds from the year they were charged:\n\nA main challenge was that property values stayed low. Last year that net taxable value \u2013 called the digest \u2013 remained effectively the same as 2011, at $20.2 billion, according to data from the county property appraiser.\n\nThe change for 2015: The total gross value is projected to be $24.7 billion by year\u2019s end, with a net value of $22 billion.\n\nThat increase is projected to bring in another $36 million in revenue this year.\n\nMay\u2019s midyear budget adjustment calls for the county to spend $12.7 million of that money on items such as body cameras for police officers.\n\nBut May wants the rest, nearly $23 million, to be put into reserves.\n\n\"We had dipped into our reserves to make ends meet, which cost us our credit rating. We have spent every year since trying to restore that,\" said county spokesman Burke Brennan. \"It\u2019s our greatest single allocation from the increase from the economic recovery, but we will accomplish our goal.\"\n\nThere are two caveats to that claim.\n\nOne is detailed. May\u2019s proposed budget adjustment shows that two of the five active tax funds \u2013 the fund set aside for fire service and unincorporated reserve that takes money from Recorders Court and business licenses \u2013 will fall below that one month goal.\n\nOnly when the police reserve, designated reserve for roads and parks and the general fund reserve are added in does the overall reserve reach the 1.2 month of expenditures.\n\nRating agencies will look at the both the individual funds and the combined total reserve in their reviews. Michael Rinaldi, a senior director for Fitch who is the primary analyst for DeKalb, said that agency would consider police and fire reserves to be for essential services but would also look holistically.\n\n\"They have been moving in the right direction,\" Rinaldi said. \"We certainly look at the trend, and if there would be a strain for the general fund to cover any deficits. In this case, that is generally not an issue.\"\n\nThe second asterisk relates to the process itself. May\u2019s claim is based on his proposed budget adjustments. But the Board of County Commissioners has final say on those adjustments and may make changes before a vote in July.\n\nMay claimed that his mid-year budget would leave the county\u2019s reserve funds in better shape than they have been in years.\n\nConsidering in 2011, there was no money in that rainy day fund, improvement wouldn\u2019t be difficult.\n\nBut budget and audit figures show May\u2019s proposal would restore the overall reserves to a goal of one month\u2019s expenditures.", "lang": "en"}
