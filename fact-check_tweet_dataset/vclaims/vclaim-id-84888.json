But he said \u201cthey established, in talking to her, she used many devices during her four years. So I don\u2019t know whether they asked her specifically about that statement.\u201d Comey said he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to get in the business of trying to parse and judge her public statements.\u201d]\n\nWhen Clinton addressed reporters on March 10, 2015, she had a prepared statement with four points she wanted to make. The first point she made regarding her emails was that she \u201copted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department.\u201d She said she thought \u201cit would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
