Ted Cruz claimed that \u201cObamacare is discouraging people from going to medical school.\u201d Actually, medical school applicants and enrollees are at an all-time high.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen any indication of declining interest in medicine since the [Affordable Care Act] took effect,\u201d Atul Grover, an executive vice president at the Association of American Medical Colleges, told us in a phone interview.\n\nIn fact, Grover said, \u201cWe have many more qualified applicants than we have room for\u201d at the nation\u2019s medical schools.\n\nCruz, a Texas Republican, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, debated the future of the nation\u2019s health care system on CNN on Feb. 7. Cruz argued that Congress should \u201cmove swiftly to repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Cruz criticized the Affordable Care Act for having a chilling impact on prospective medical school students.\n\nBut there is no evidence that the Affordable Care Act has discouraged \u201cpeople from going to medical school.\u201d And, as we explain later, Cruz is wrong that it has discouraged students from \u201ctraining to be doctors.\u201d\n\nTotal medical school enrollment has increased every year since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010.\n\nThere are 88,304 students enrolled in medical school this school year \u2014 up from 77,371 in 2009-2010, a 14 percent increase, according to the AAMC.\n\nThe senator\u2019s office initially did not respond when we asked for supporting evidence. But after we provided the enrollment data, a Cruz spokesperson acknowledged a \u201cgradual increase\u201d in enrollment.\n\nHowever, Cruz\u2019s office pointed to a March 2015 report prepared for the AAMC that said the U.S. is facing a 90,000 shortfall in physicians by 2025. Cruz\u2019s spokesperson argued the Affordable Care Act has increased the demand for more physicians but interest in medical schools has not kept up with the demand. He blamed the Affordable Care Act without providing any evidence.\n\nIn an email to us, Cruz\u2019s spokesperson wrote: \u201cWhile one could argue this point based on economic theory, and it\u2019s difficult to \u2018prove\u2019 through the numbers exactly why the increased demand brought on by the ACA has not been reflected in a proportionate increase in doctors, the claim was not false from a fact-check perspective, and to say so would be misleading conjecture.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmisleading conjecture\u201d is on his part, not ours.\n\nThe authors of the report cited by Cruz\u2019s office said they projected the physician shortfall at 130,600 in the 2010 report. They revised that estimate down to 90,400 in the 2015 report, citing several reasons. One reason: The \u201cnumber of physicians completing their graduate medical education has risen from about 27,000 to about 29,000 annually,\u201d the report said.\n\nCruz\u2019s office is right about physician shortfall, but wrong about the cause, said Grover, the AAMC\u2019s executive vice president. He said an aging population, not the Affordable Care Act, is the primary reason for the shortage.\n\nGrover said his organization in 2006 set a goal of increasing first-year medical student enrollment by 30 percent by 2015-2016 (from the 2002-2003 level) to address the physician shortage. That was nearly accomplished on schedule. \u201cBetween 2002 and 2016, U.S. medical school enrollment has risen by more than 27 percent,\u201d Darrell G. Kirch, AAMC president and CEO, said in a Nov. 1, 2016, press release announcing a new record for medical school enrollees.\n\nFirst-year enrollment is expected to reach the 30 percent goal by 2017-2018, according to the organization\u2019s 2015 enrollment report.\n\nSo, medical schools have done their part, Grover said.\n\n\u201cThe medical school growth is not an issue\u201d in meeting the physician shortage, Grover told us. \u201cIt\u2019s the lack of residency positions\u201d at teaching hospitals.\n\nThe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 set caps on the number of residency positions that the federal government funds. The AAMC has been lobbying Congress ever since to raise them.\n\nKirch, the AAMC president and CEO, said in an Oct. 22, 2015, press release that U.S. medical schools set records for applicants and first-year enrollment in 2015. He said those figures \u201cshow that medical schools are doing their part to prepare the next generation of health care professionals,\u201d but he called on Congress to lift the residency caps and \u201cincrease federal support for residency training.\u201d\n\nIn short, Cruz blames the Affordable Care Act for \u201cdiscouraging people from \u2026 training to be doctors,\u201d when in fact it is the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that is to blame, according to the AAMC.\n\nIn addition, we find that medical school applicants are rising even more quickly than enrollment, despite the claim by Cruz\u2019s spokesperson that \u201cinterest in medical schools has not kept up with the demand for more physicians.\u201d\n\nIn its 2015 press release, the AAMC said the number of first-time medical school applicants is \u201can important indicator of interest in medicine.\u201d This year it has reached a new high at 38,773 \u2014 up from 30,998 in 2009-2010. That\u2019s a 25 percent increase.\n\nWhen asked why applications outstrip enrollment, Grover said medical schools are limited in the number of applicants that they can accept. \u201cWe have many more qualified applicants than we have room for,\u201d Grover said.\n\nThe total number of applicants increased by 25 percent, from 42,265 in 2009-2010 to 53,029 in 2016-2017. The largest increases in applicants over the last 10 years came in the 2014 school year (6.1 percent) and 2016 (6.2 percent), as the chart below shows.\n\nIn the end, there\u2019s simply no evidence for Cruz\u2019s claim that \u201cObamacare is discouraging people from going to medical school and training to be doctors.\u201d In fact, medical school enrollment and applications continue their upward climb.", "lang": "en"}
