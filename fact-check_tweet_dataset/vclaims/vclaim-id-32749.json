The claim is false; the video has previously circulated in reports about a hairless sun bear that was captured in Borneo, an island in Malaysia.\n\nThis 52-second video was published on YouTube on March 14, 2017. It has since been viewed more than three million times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSigbin captured in Surigao city\u201d.\n\n\u201cSigbin\u201d is a blood-sucking creature in Philippine mythology, often described as a cross between a dog and a kangaroo, that hunts at night for the hearts of infants.\n\nSurigao is a city in Mindanao Island, south of the Philippines.\n\nThe video was also shared here and here on Facebook, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has circulated in media reports of a hairless sun bear found in Bintangor, on the Malaysian island of Borneo in 2015.\n\nReverse image searches of keyframes extracted from the video in the misleading posts using online verification tool InVID found this higher resolution video uploaded on YouTube. It was published by an account for the English-language Malay newspaper The Borneo Post, dated April 6, 2015.\n\nThe caption states, in part: \u201cThe sun bear is in a makeshift cage awaiting transport to Matang Wildlife Centre for rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and The Borneo Post video (R):\n\nThe video was also embedded in this April 2, 2015 report by The Borneo Post, headlined \u201cMonths-long search for hairless \u2018sun bear\u2019 over\u201d.\n\nThe report reads, in part: \u201cBINTANGOR: Months after it was first sighted and chased away into the jungle, the \u2018strange creature\u2019 at the centre of the video clip that went viral earlier this year was finally found and captured by oil palm plantation workers today.\n\n\u201cAccording to the plantation manager who requested anonymity, the animal which is suspected to be a sick and hairless sun bear, was discovered by the workers at about 7am within the same area where it was first spotted on Jan 30 this year.\u201d\n\nA subsequent The Borneo Post report published on May 20, 2015 states the sun bear died of late-stage cancer.\n\nSun bears are a bear species found in the forests of Southeast Asia. They are listed as an endangered species, often killed for their bile, which has been used in traditional medicine for hundreds of years.", "lang": "en"}
