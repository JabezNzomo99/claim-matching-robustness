But that\u2019s a fairy tale.\n\nOne image published Aug. 29 on Facebook purports to show cranes removing a spire from the castle, an iconic site at Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Fla.\n\n\"BREAKING: Workers have begun removing spires of Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom ahead of Hurricane Dorian,\" reads the photo\u2019s caption.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it\u2019s been shared hundreds of times by several users, so we wanted to check it out.\n\nTurns out, it\u2019s just another iteration of a long-running hoax about Florida hurricanes.\n\nRELATED: Hurricanes and tropical storms lead to flood of misinformation\n\nSnopes debunked it in October 2017. In its fact-check, Snopes wrote that rumors claiming Cinderella Castle can be partially or fully deconstructed during hurricanes go back as far as 1997, when the Chicago Tribune wrote about them as one of \"25 Secrets of the Magic Kingdom.\"\n\n\"According to imagineers involved in its construction, Cinderella Castle was built to code to withstand hurricane-force winds and can in no way be disassembled,\" the newspaper wrote at the time, without naming any sources.\n\nIn a Sept. 4 email to PolitiFact, Disney World said it was not dismantling the castle in preparation for Dorian.\n\nAs for the photo we found on Facebook, there\u2019s evidence that it was digitally altered to make it look like a castle spire is being removed by a crane.\n\nUsing a reverse image search, we found the exact same photo of Cinderella Castle published on Twitter in the lead-up to Hurricane Michael last year. We also found a very similar image published in a blog post in 2009 \u2014 but with the spire intact. The crane in the photo was reportedly being used to remove holiday lights.\n\nUsing FotoForensics, a visual analysis tool, we were able to isolate the manipulation. The tool results indicate that someone cloned part of the blue sky and placed it over part of the castle spire on the left-hand side. The right-hand spire appears to have been removed altogether.\n\nThe Facebook post is not accurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
