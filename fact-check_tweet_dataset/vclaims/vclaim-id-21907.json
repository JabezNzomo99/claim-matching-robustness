A video titled \"DAYAAN SA ITALY NABISTO NG MGA OFW NALOKO NA! (Cheating discovered in overseas voting in Italy)\" was posted by Youtube channel Junriel Llander on Monday, April 15, airing the same concerns and calling for the system of voting to be changed. It has over 68,000 views as of posting.\n\nWhile the concerns regarding the overseas absentee voting process raised seemed legitimate, the videos showed no direct evidence of cheating done by Commission on Elections (Comelec) officials at the Philippine embassy in the United Kingdom or in Italy, contrary to what the videos' titles claim.\n\nOne OFW from London asked, \u201cWalang resibo, at the same time, ifi-feed ba (There is no receipt or proof of voting, at the same time, is Comelec going to feed the ballots into the vote counting machines or VCMs at all)?\"\n\nTwo others shared a similar gripe, asking how they could make sure that their ballots are fed into the VCMs.\n\nMeanwhile, two OFWs from Florence also complained about how they wouldn't be the ones feeding their ballots into the VCMs. This, they said, could potentially lead to cheating.\n\nThe mode of voting observed at both the Philippine embassy in London and the embassy in Rome is postal, automated election system (AES) of voting. This means that voters will mail their ballots to respective voting posts and Comelec-designated officials will feed their ballots into VCMs. (READ: What you need to know if you\u2019re an overseas absentee voter)", "lang": "en"}
