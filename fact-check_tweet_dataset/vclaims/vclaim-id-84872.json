They cited Cohen\u2019s claim and doubled-down on the question in a video, which was retweeted or liked at least 4,600 times:\n\nWe reached out to Cohen directly and through the Trump Organization and Trump campaign several times, but he didn\u2019t respond to our request for a source for his claim. So we dug around to see if there were any facts to support it. What we found had all the makings of a mishmash talking point stringing together different information relating to Haiti recovery efforts \u2014 such as a message from the last player in a game of \u201cTelephone.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons played a major role in recovery efforts in Haiti after the devastating earthquake in 2010. Former president Bill Clinton was the public face of U.S. efforts in Haiti through several recovery roles. He was the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, co-leader of the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund (with former president George W. Bush) and co-chairman of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, a quasi-government planning body that approved hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. government-funded recovery projects.\n\nThe Clinton family\u2019s charitable work in Haiti has been a mix of success, disappointment and controversy. As our Washington Post colleagues reported, some Clinton-backed projects didn\u2019t come through, such as a $2 million housing expo for thousands of new housing units. The Government Accountability Office found poor planning and unsustainable outcomes for taxpayer-funded projects through USAID, such as a $170 million power plant and port for the Caracol Industrial Park, which the Clinton Foundation promoted.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s younger brother had connections to a mining project in Haiti, raising suspicions among Haitians about the Clintons\u2019 motives. Luxury hotel projects paid by the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund promised construction jobs \u2014 but for Haitians, it represented another disconnect between Clinton-backed efforts and the realities of one of the poorest countries struggling to rebuild after one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThere\u2019s real frustration among Haitians over failures in progress promised to them, not just by the Clintons but from the international community at large. In 2015, Haitian activists protested outside the Clinton Foundation in New York, claiming the Clintons mismanaged hundreds of millions in taxpayer money through the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission.\n\nBut there is no evidence that Hillary Clinton, through the Clinton Foundation, raised \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d for a hospital that was never built. We consulted groups that have been critical of recovery delays in Haiti, but they could not point to a specific Clinton Foundation-funded hospital project, either.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to figure out what he might be citing as well, but we can\u2019t provide you with a source of his claim because one doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Craig Minassian, a Clinton Foundation spokesman. \u201cThe Clinton Foundation never committed to build a hospital, nor did it accept, raise, or spend funds for that purpose. His claim is false.\u201d\n\nFor example, the USAID inspector general found delays in the $99 million reconstruction of medical facilities and medical supply warehouses through the Health Infrastructure Program. This program included the $82.3 million construction of the country\u2019s key public hospital, the Hospital of the State University of Haiti in Port-au-Prince, one of the first projects that the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission approved. But the project is backed by money from the U.S. government, Haiti and France \u2014 not the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAnother major hospital project was the University Hospital in Mirebalais, run by Partners in Health, a group that has worked on recovery efforts with the Clinton Foundation. This hospital opened in 2013, and Partners in Health confirmed that no donation of \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d was committed by the Clinton Foundation for the project. (The Clinton Foundation is not listed as a supporter.)\n\nThere is, indeed, a major public hospital in Port-au-Prince that has been delayed, even though it was one of the first projects approved by the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. The commission was co-chaired by Bill Clinton, who became the face of many recovery efforts in Haiti. Cohen can blame Bill Clinton\u2019s leadership on the commission, or the managing of taxpayer money for this project. But that claim is entirely different from the one Cohen made. Perhaps Cohen was referring to the $500 million in \u201ccommitments to action\u201d for Haiti initiatives announced by the Clinton Foundation. But not all of the commitments were relating to health care or building a hospital, and the commitments don\u2019t involve Clinton Foundation money.\n\nWe\u2019ve done our part to check out his claim, but the burden of proof still lies with Cohen. If he wants to respond and point us to a specific source, we\u2019re eager to take a look. In the meantime, he earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
