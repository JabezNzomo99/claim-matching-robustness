It actually shows an aardvark, which is the name of the company that designs and manufactures the trucks.\n\nConspiracy theorists skeptical of COVID-19 have mistaken an aardvark for an ancient Egyptian deity.\n\nA photo collage circulating on QAnon message boards and Facebook groups makes the claim that the logo on a COVID-19 mobile testing unit depicts Anubis, the Egyptian god of embalming.\n\n\u201cWhy does the COVID-19 testing facility have a logo of Anubis the god of Death?\u201d asks the text above an array of photos that includes a COVID-19 testing truck, an image of Anubis, and a circled image of the logo.\n\nBut the logo actually belongs to Aardvark Mobile Health, a division of Aardvark Mobile Tours, which started making the trucks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe logo for that company is, you guessed it, a head-on view of an aardvark.\n\n\u201cThe logo for Aardvark Mobile Tours was created in 2007 and includes the Aardvark head \u2013 which is what you see in the COVID-19 testing logo,\u201d spokeswoman Carolyn Lang told FactCheck.org in an email.\n\nThe company currently operates testing trucks in the Miami area, Lang said. Florida has been a hotspot for COVID-19, with more than 73,000 new cases reported in the last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief executive officer, Larry Borden, chose Aardvark as the company name because the double \u201cA\u201d would put it at the beginning of the phone book, Lang said.\n\nAardvarks are nocturnal African mammals that feast on bugs. Anubis is an ancient Egyptian deity who is often portrayed with the head of a jackal. Both have a snout and tall ears. See below for pictures of each one.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
