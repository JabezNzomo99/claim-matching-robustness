It was present in the Swine Flu vaccine used in the 2009/10 and 2010/11 flu seasons in the UK, but it\u2019s not in any of the annual flu vaccines currently being used in the UK.\n\nThiomersal doesn't have the same chemical structure as the mercury that can contaminate fish and build up in the body. That is methyl mercury, which can cause major health issues. It also isn\u2019t the same chemical structure as the mercury which was historically used in the hat making process\u2014which the original Facebook post alludes to. That was mercuric nitrate which famously caused health issues for those coming into close, regular contact with the substance.\n\nThiomersal is an ethyl mercury, and exposure to it in vaccines is much lower than to methyl mercury in contaminated fish eaten regularly.\n\nAccording to the Vaccine Knowledge Project at the University of Oxford (a project by a group of consultants, researchers, nurses and statisticians looking at vaccines at the university\u2019s Department of Paediatrics) thiomersal was removed from most standard vaccines in the UK, the US and Europe \u201cas a precaution\u201d, and there was no evidence it caused harm. It was removed from UK vaccines between 2003 and 2005.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that thiomersal (also known as thimerosal in the US) has been used in vaccines as a preservative, stopping the growth of bacteria and fungi. This is usually only in multi-dose vials, when an individual vaccine dose is drawn with a needle from the same container, which contains several doses.\n\nAccording to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases the only known side effects of receiving low doses of thiomersal in vaccines are \u201cminor reactions such as redness and swelling at the injection site\u201d.\n\nSeveral studies have shown infant and adult blood levels of mercury return to normal soon after being given vaccinations containing thiomersal. A 2014 study from Australia looking at over a million children found there was no link between thiomersal in vaccines and developing autism.", "lang": "en"}
