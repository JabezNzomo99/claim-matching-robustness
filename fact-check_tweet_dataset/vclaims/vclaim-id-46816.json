These posts claim that the video shows Indian students being deported from Canada for submitting fake results of International English Language Testing System (IELTS), an English language proficiency test.\n\nLt Col Aamir, a retired Pakistan army officer (as per his Twitter bio) tweeted the video with the same claim. He wrote, \u201cThis is in Pearson Intl today. A batch of indian student were deported back when their IELTS results were found to be fake. Imagine Indians are sending students abroad on fake degrees.\u201d\n\nSimilar posts were posted by several social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nOn December 31, the official twitter account of the Canada Border Services Agency posted a tweet to refuse the claims made in the post. The tweet said, \u201cThe #CBSA can confirm that the content and caption of a video circulating on social media are false. The video shows an overflow waiting area at @TorontoPearson where international students are awaiting study permit processing. The individuals are not waiting to be deported.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral Pakistani social media users, therefore, shared the video with the false claim that India students are being deported from Pearson airport because they showed fake documents of IELTS score.", "lang": "en"}
