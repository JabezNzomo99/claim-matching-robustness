Ted Cruz, R-Texas, announced that he was officially running for president this week, he got one. About 11,000 students at Liberty University in Virginia were on hand when Cruz came to their campus. But as Jess McIntosh, the spokeswoman for the abortion rights group Emily\u2019s List noted, they weren\u2019t there necessarily by choice.\n\n\"Students were mandated to be in attendance or they would be fined,\" McIntosh told Chris Hayes on MSNBC on March 24, 2015. \"Not as much as they would be fined for possessing R-rated movies or practicing witchcraft, but still, they had to pay money if they didn\u2019t want to see him.\"\n\nMcIntosh wasn\u2019t the only person to make this point, and a reader asked us to see what was up at Liberty University.\n\nIn this case, McIntosh gets an A for accuracy, although there was no special rule related to Cruz.\n\nThe university, founded by televangelist Jerry Falwell, requires its 13,500 residential students to attend as many as three events each week as part of a program called . There are sermons by guest pastors, performances from Christian entertainers and talks by leaders in many fields.\n\nWhat happens if you don\u2019t go?\n\nThe university\u2019s has the list of consequences for various infractions. Missing Convocation is on the list. (A reprimand is a formal mark against a student\u2019s record.) Here\u2019s what the handbook says:\n\nEach student should be familiar with these sanctions.\n\nLate for curfew (1 additional reprimand for each 30 minutes late)\n\nLate for Convocation (1 additional reprimand for each 15 minutes late)\n\nCruz\u2019s presidential announcement was scheduled as a Convocation event by the university, therefore the penalty for a student\u2019s absence would be four reprimands and a $10 fine.\n\nLiberty University issued a statement about Cruz\u2019s speech that confirmed that \"missing Convocation is only a minor penalty, a $10 fine.\"\n\nUniversity President Jerry Falwell Jr. addressed the Convocation requirement in a after Cruz\u2019s address. \"Convocation speakers do not all line up with traditional Evangelical Christian viewpoints or even Liberty University\u2019s doctrinal statement. A fundamental part of the college experience is being exposed to a variety of viewpoints so students can better understand why they hold their own beliefs and be better prepared to defend them.\"\n\nStudents were aware of the rule. One of them posted about it on her . Citing another student, she wrote, \"Students will either attend Convocation and lend to the illusion of widespread support for Sen. Cruz, or they will be subject to administrative punishment -- specifically, four reprimands and a $10 fine -- if they are absent.\"\n\nWe have plenty of questions about the fine system, but Liberty University officials didn\u2019t get back to us before our deadline.\n\nIf the crowd at Cruz\u2019s announcement was 11,000 -- -- does that mean at least 2,500 students skipped the event and are subject to a fine?\n\nHow does Liberty University take attendance? (We did find that might begin to explain that question.)\n\nHow many attendance fines were issued in 2014, or any other period of time?\n\nIncidentally, McIntosh is also correct about the greater sanctions for worse offenses. There\u2019s a penalty on the books of 12 reprimands and a $50 fine for seeing an R-rated movie, deception, and participating in an unauthorized petition or demonstration. Participating in a seance, witchcraft or other demonic activity carries a $500 fine, 30 hours of community service, 30 reprimands and possible expulsion.\n\nMcIntosh said Liberty University students \"were mandated\" to attend Cruz\u2019s presidential announcement \"or they would be fined.\"\n\nCruz\u2019s speech was part of a regular program at the university called Convocation. By the letter of the law, students are required to attend or pay a $10 fine. The private university wouldn\u2019t tell us if they issued any fines to students skipping Cruz\u2019s speech, how the system works and how often fines are issued.\n\nMcIntosh\u2019s claim is accurate.
