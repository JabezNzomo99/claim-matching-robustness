Of course not: the story originated on a satirical website set up to troll conservatives and Republicans.\n\nOn March 20, 2018 the website The Last Line of Defense posted an article titled \"BREAKING : Gay Pornstar Comes Forward With Pence Accusations.\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThis Monday, another hardcore erotic film star came forward to tell a tale of sexual debauchery with a resident of Pennsylvania Avenue. But this time, the alleged romp partner was Vice President Mike Pence. The homosexual Asian film actor, Nguyen Jolie, who goes by the sobriquet : \"Ricky Ruvpump\" released a tell-all book of his experiences in the adult film world, \"Ricky Ruvs Rife\". In the book, Jolie makes mention of attending a \"pray the gay away\" camp in 2002, run by Pence and his wife, Karen. He goes on to expound on several instances when he and the future Vice President were intimate together, at times, in explicit detail. For instance, this excerpt, from page 71 : \"He was very friendly, like a caring grandfather. His hands were smooth, and smelled like cocoa butter. He told me I was beautiful, and touched my lips with his thumbs. He gently pushed me back onto the piano that he had just been playing, and told me he was going to 'tickle my ivories'. He was a very warm and, somewhat sticky lover.\"\n\nThe homosexual actor does not exist and there is no book named \"Ricky Ruvs Rife\". Jolie Nguyen does happen to be the real name of Miss Vietnam World 2015 but she looks nothing like the man in the picture (who seems to show up if you search \"japan gay boy man on Instagram\" via image search engines).\n\nUsers on social media might have only seen this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThat probably caused them to miss the clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article on The Last Line of Defense:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as ladiesofliberty.net, shareotonin.com and dailyworldupdate.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
