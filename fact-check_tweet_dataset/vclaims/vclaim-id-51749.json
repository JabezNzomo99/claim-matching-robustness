The football team, however, is still scheduled to move forward with a modified Atlantic Coast Conference schedule.\n\nThat upset U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. The University of Connecticut was the first major football program to cancel its season due to the pandemic.\n\n\"Notre Dame and UNC are sending kids home because of COVID outbreaks (at UNC 14% of students tested positive),\" Murphy tweeted on Aug. 18, adding: \"But...not football players! They need to stay no matter the risk, because the college football money machine needs to keep churning.\"\n\nHis tweet linked to a New York Times story about the situation at UNC.\n\nMurphy was clearly trying to make a point about college athletes being exploited. While doing so, however, he failed to provide the full context of UNC\u2019s outbreak.\n\nIs it true that 14% of students tested positive, as Murphy said? Not exactly.\n\nThe percentage Murphy quoted is generally accurate. It\u2019s what the percentage represents that he didn\u2019t properly convey.\n\nMurphy\u2019s tweet could give the impression that 14% of all students tested positive. That would mean that more than 2,670 of UNC\u2019s 19,117 undergraduate students have COVID-19.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case.\n\nWhile some schools (including Duke University) required students to be tested before entering campus, UNC didn\u2019t. UNC encourages students to be tested if they believe they have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIn the week from Aug. 10 to 16, 954 students were tested. Of those, 130 \u2014 or 13.6% \u2014 tested positive. The university updates its testing numbers weekly on its online dashboard.\n\nIs it fair to say that the week\u2019s infection rate for those who were tested accurately reflects the entire UNC student population? No.\n\nBecause UNC is only testing people who think they need it, the results are likely to skewed, said Donald Taylor, director of the Social Science Research Institute at Duke University.\n\n\"UNC is doing \u2018symptomatic\u2019 testing when folks are feeling sick, and contact tracing testing when you ask a person newly infected to say who they have been in close contact with, and then those folks are tested,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"People who feel sick, or who were in close contact with those who are positive would be expected to have a much higher rate of \u2018positivity\u2019 than would an entire population,\" Taylor said.\n\nIf it was a random sample of students, you could extrapolate, \"but would need to say it is a rough estimate,\" said Peter Ubel, a physician and behavioral scientist at the Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business.\n\n\"If they tested symptomatic students, or ones with known exposures, then that suggests the 14% figure is higher than probably seen across the student body,\" Ubel said.\n\nUNC spokespersons emailed PolitiFact to reiterate that the 14% positivity rate \"does not reflect all students.\" It represents only students \"who took a COVID-19 test and had a positive result for coronavirus that week.\"\n\nAs for Murphy, his office doesn\u2019t believe the tweet is misleading at all.\n\n\"Senator Murphy didn\u2019t say it was 14% of all students,\" Murphy spokesperson Jamie Geller said. \"He said it was 14%, with no qualifier, which logically infers that it\u2019s of those who are tested. But in case there was any confusion, he linked to the article.\"\n\nWe disagree with the notion that Murphy\u2019s tweet clearly refers only to students who were tested.\n\nMurphy tweeted that \"at UNC 14% of students tested positive.\"\n\nSomeone who reads Murphy\u2019s tweet could understand that he\u2019s referring to the small sample of students who were tested. But, on its face, the tweet could give the impression that more than 2,600 students contracted COVID-19.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case. It would have been more accurate to tweet that 14% of tests were positive, rather than students. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
