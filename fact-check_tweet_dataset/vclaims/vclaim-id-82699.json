This is my janmabhoomi.\u201d\n\nNoteworthy, that the YouTube description of the video mentions that Ghosh was born in Bangladesh\u2019s Fardipur and raised in Chittagong. The description reads as, \"Though Anju Ghosh was raised in Chittagong, she was born in Faridpur. She ventured into cinema when she was in the eighth standard. Her first film was Tamij-uddin Rizvi\u2019s Ashirwad.\"\n\nBOOM has reached out to the Chief News Editor of Prothom Alo, Selim Khan for a comment. The article will be updated upon receiving a reply.\n\nGhosh and the cine artistes of Bangladesh held a press conference in September 2018, on her return to the country after spending 22 years in Kolkata. In the video below, Ghosh can be heard saying, \u201cToday that I landed in my motherland, it is not because of any intentions. I am not here to do a film or see how the film industry is doing. I have come here as a pilgrim.\u201d\n\nGhosh then goes on to say, \u201cThere is a certain pull of the motherland.\u201d Later she refers to her hit film 'Beder Meye Jyotsna' (the highest grossing Bangladeshi film) which still connects with her audience.\n\nBOOM reached out to actor Misha Sawdagor, president of Bangladesh Film Artiste Association, who was also present at the press interaction. The article will be updated once he reverts.\n\nIn another interaction of Ghosh, it is mentioned that the actress was born in Bhanga area of Faridpur, on September 8, 1956.\n\nA Facebook page of Ghosh also suggests that the actress was born in Bhanga of Faridpur district. Here is the archived link of the page. Interestingly, Ghosh evaded questions on her citizenship status when asked.\n\nAlso, the registration number of the birth certificate (2917) shared by Dilip Ghosh doesn't match the registration number (1131) of the certificate accessed by BOOM from Kolkata Municipal Corporation.\n\nBOOM also reached out to East End Nursing Home Pvt Ltd, Kolkata, where Ghosh was reportedly born. However, we were told that records of child births could only be accessed through the civic body.\n\nBOOM observed that Anju Ghosh's Wikipedia page has been changed more than 50 times since the time the BJP announced her political entry. Ghosh's age was first introduced in her Wikipedia page on May 13, 2012.\n\nHowever, the latest edited page, at the time of writing this article, doesn't mention Ghosh's age anymore. Though, her birthplace still remains the same: Bhanga, Faridpur.\n\nBangladeshi actors penalised for participating in political meets in the past\n\nAnju Ghosh's induction in the BJP brings back the mysterious connection that Bangladeshi actors have with the Indian political diaspora. In April, Bangladeshi actor Ferdous Ahmed's visa was cancelled by the Centre after he was spotted campaigning for Raiganj's TMC candidate. Ahmed was blacklisted by the Centre as well.\n\nAnother actor Ghazi Abdul Noor, was asked by the Union home ministry to leave the country immediately after he was found attending a Trinamool Congress rally, on an expired visa.", "lang": "en"}
