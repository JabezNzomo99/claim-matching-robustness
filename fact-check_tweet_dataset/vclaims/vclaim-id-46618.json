Pass it on.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Einstein ever said or wrote this statement.\n\nWhile Einstein is best known for his contributions to the field of physics, most notably his theories of special and general relativity, he was also known to discuss philosophy, religion and politics and would occasionally mete out general life advice. \u201cTry not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value,\u201d he once told a young man seeking guidance.\n\nHowever, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Einstein ever said or wrote the expression attributed to him on creativity. A search of the Einstein Archives Online returned no results for the word \u201ccontagious,\u201d and a spokesperson for the Einstein Papers Project, another extensive collection of Einstein\u2019s written work, told TheDCNF that she could not verify the quote.\n\nIt also appears nowhere in the book \u201cThe Ultimate Quotable Einstein,\u201d which features more than 1,000 verified Einstein quotes. (RELATED: Did Einstein Say That Technology Would Create A \u2018Generation Of Idiots\u2019?)\n\nAccording to the website Quote Investigator, the quote dates back to at least 1977, published in the book \u201cCreative Growth Games.\u201d The first known attribution to Einstein was in 1992, found in an advertisement for IBM.\n\nEinstein did value creativity and once said during an interview, \u201cI am enough of the artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
