Carona virus (sic) vaccine ready. Able to cure patient within 3 hours after injection. Hats off to US Scientists.\u201d It also claimed that US President Donald Trump announced that \u201cRoche Medical Company\u201d will release the vaccine \u201con Sunday.\u201d\n\nThis is false on two accounts.\n\nFirst, a reverse image search reveals the \u201cvaccine\u201d featured in the photo is actually a COVID-19 testing kit developed by the South Korean medical technology company Sugentech, Inc.\n\nThe earliest traceable copy online of the image can be found in a March 20 report by South Korean business news media Maeil Business Newspaper, which says the country is exporting the test kits to several countries, including the Philippines. It credited Sugentech for the photo.\n\nSugentech announced on March 6 that it has developed the \u201cSGTi-flex COVID-19 IgM&IgG\u201d to detect antibodies -- immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) -- in a person\u2019s blood triggered by a COVID-19 infection.\n\nSecondly, the claim about \u201cRoche Medical Company\u201d supposedly releasing a COVID-19 vaccine \u201con Sunday\u201d was debunked by VERA Files Fact Check this week. Roche Diagnostics, whose chief executive officer spoke during Trump\u2019s March 13 public address, only announced that its COVID-19 test kits have been approved for emergency use by U.S. authorities. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: FB post on Trump announcing launch of \u2018COVID-19 vaccine\u2019 NOT TRUE)\n\nThe false posts surfaced a week after Washington-based research facility Kaiser Permanente announced on March 16 that it has conducted the first trial on humans of a newly-developed COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. According to the World Health Organization\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme technical lead Dr. Maria Van Verkhove, there are now at least 20 vaccines undergoing development around the world.\n\nThe netizens\u2019 fallacious posts have been shared over 1,800 times.", "lang": "en"}
