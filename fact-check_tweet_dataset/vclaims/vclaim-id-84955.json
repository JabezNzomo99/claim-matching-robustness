As of Sept. 15, 35 fact-checking countries from 27 countries have agreed to the principles, including the three main U.S. fact-checking organizations. Snopes, which since 1995 has debunked Internet legends and increasingly publishes political fact checks, also signed onto the principles.\n\nThere can be wide differences among fact-checking organizations, reflecting not just cultural or national distinctions. Some fact checkers are attached to newspapers, others to universities or nongovernmental organizations. Funding is a persistent problem for many. But the hope is that a commitment to core principles will help ensure quality, consistency and transparency, in addition to accountability designed to foster quality reports. Fact checking organizations that have agreed to the principles will be required to publish an annual report explaining how they have adhered to each of the five principles.\n\nThe International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) at Poynter is committed to promoting excellence in fact-checking. Nonpartisan and transparent fact-checking can be a powerful instrument of accountability journalism. Conversely, unsourced or biased fact-checking can increase distrust in the media and experts while polluting public understanding. The following document is the result of consultations among fact-checkers from around the world; it offers conscientious practitioners principles to aspire to in their everyday work.\n\n(1) A COMMITMENT TO NONPARTISANSHIP AND FAIRNESS\n\n We fact-check claims using the same standard for every fact check. We do not concentrate our fact-checking on any one side. We follow the same process for every fact check and let the evidence dictate our conclusions. We do not advocate or take policy positions on the issues we fact-check.\n\n(2) A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY OF SOURCES\n\n We want our readers to be able to verify our findings themselves. We provide all sources in enough detail that readers can replicate our work, except in cases where a source\u2019s personal security could be compromised. In such cases, we provide as much detail as possible.\n\n(3) A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY OF FUNDING & ORGANIZATION\n\n We are transparent about our funding sources. If we accept funding from other organizations, we ensure that funders have no influence over the conclusions we reach in our reports. We detail the professional background of all key figures in our organization and explain our organizational structure and legal status. We clearly indicate a way for readers to communicate with us.\n\n(4) A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY OF METHODOLOGY\n\n We explain the methodology we use to select, research, write, edit, publish and correct our fact checks. We encourage readers to send us claims to fact-check and are transparent on why and how we fact-check.\n\n(5) A COMMITMENT TO OPEN AND HONEST CORRECTIONS\n\n We publish our corrections policy and follow it scrupulously. We correct clearly and transparently in line with our corrections policy, seeking so far as possible to ensure that readers see the corrected version.\n\nBy signing up to this code of principles, the fact-checking initiatives agree to produce a public report indicating how they have lived up to each of the five principles within a year from their signature, and once a year thereafter. The report will allow readers and others to judge to what extent the fact-checker is respecting the code of principles and will be linked to from this page.", "lang": "en"}
