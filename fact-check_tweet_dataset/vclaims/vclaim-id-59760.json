Below is a screenshot of the graph of the exchange rate for last year:\n\nAll information has been taken from XE.com, a Canada-based online foreign exchange tools and services company, also a subsidiary of Euronet Worldwide which provides information about exchange rates. Therefore, Indian Rupee did not become weaker than the Bangladeshi Taka. Exchange rates can be either fixed or floating. Fixed exchange rates use a standard, such as gold or another precious metal, and each unit of currency corresponds to a fixed quantity of that standard that should (theoretically) exist. A floating exchange rate means that each currency isn't necessarily backed by a resource. Currently, the international exchange rates are determined by a managed floating exchange rate. A managed floating exchange rate means that each currency's value is affected by the economic actions of its government or central bank.
