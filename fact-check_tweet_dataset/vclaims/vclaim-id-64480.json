A Twitter post had similarly garnered more than 40,000 views.\n\nSnopes spoke with Brian Fisher, an entomologist and ant expert with the California Academy of Sciences, who said that the footage appears to be real, adding that he has observed similar behavior. The video shows \u201cmain highways\u201d or \u201ctrunk trails\u201d \u2014 the top is the termite highway and the bottom is the ant highway, the latter of which may last for days.\n\n\u201cFor the ants, the highway is used to transport food back to the nest and because these goods are valuable, the trails is protected. In particular, the ants are defending the trail from other predators that may eat the ants or steal the food but also from any disturbance that will disrupt the flow of ants,\u201d explained Fisher.\n\n\u201cA mess of termites walking through your highway will cause quite a traffic jam and create a costly slowdown.\u201d\n\nFisher believes that the ants are Asian marauder ants (Carebara diversa) and that the video was likely filmed in Southeast Asia. Colonies of C. diversa can be made up of 250,000 individuals and contain, among other roles, small workers and larger soldiers, the latter of which have been known to carry their smaller comrades. The termites in the video are thought to be Longipeditermes longipes, a species endemic to Southeast Asia and known for its unique defensive strategy. When a disturbance or threat is perceived, soldier termites will organize themselves into two flanking lanes in defense of an interior center lane, allowing worker termites to continue their tasks.\n\n\u201cAll ants and social insects communicate with chemical \u2018words\u2019 called pheromones \u2014 think of it like perfume. For any social system to work, there must be a way to communicate,\u201d said Fisher.\n\nAnts, termites, and other social insects communicate by way of chemical signals in order to gather food, build their nests, or defend against territorial disputes. Fisher referenced a 2009 report published in Encyclopedia of Insects that describes this behavior as \u201ccooperative defense\u201d to cope with threats. When a threat is recognized, individual ants or termites will discharge a pheromone trail from specialized glands (the exocrine gland in ants and the sternal gland in termites) as they travel from area to area. Not only do these trails allow individuals to communicate within their own species, but those left by other insects will also signal the different scents of competitors.\n\nThough ants \u201clove\u201d to eat termites, Fisher adds that L. longipes has a \u201cnasty chemical defense,\u201d so the ants keep their distance. Furthermore, the formation of a trunk trail means that the ants are \u201cfocused on the commute\u201d and are going back to the nest with collected food.\n\nMany species of both termites and ants have evolved a suite of unique \u2014 and equally bizarre \u2014 defensive mechanisms to protect themselves. Soldier termites have been known to put their oldest individuals on the front lines when defending against carnivorous ants, found a study published in Biology Letters. As their name suggests, an ant species known as Colobopsis explodens were nicknamed \u201cexploding ants\u201d for their ability to sacrifice themselves during combat by \u201crupturing their gaster [an abdominal section] and releasing sticky and irritant contents\u2026to kill or repel rivals.\u201d\n\nAnts have also developed interesting hacks to make their lives easier. Some species have been recorded transporting large millipedes and earthworms by forming chains made of more than 50 individual worker ants. Named for their ability to build nests, African weaver ants bend leaves into place and then bind them together by holding and manipulating silk-producing larvae to \u201cweave\u201d together nests.", "lang": "en"}
