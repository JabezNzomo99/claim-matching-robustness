Mrs. Vassilyeva from Russia gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets.\"\n\nThe archived version of the post is saved here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The Russian woman mentioned in the post does hold the world record for having the highest number of children. But the viral image has no connection with her.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found the viral picture in an article on polygamy published by the \"Utah Historical Quarterly\" in 2005. In this picture from 1904, Joseph F. Smith, president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is seen with his wives and children.\n\nInternational fact-check website \"Snopes\" had earlier found that the same image was used by a website called \"Top 10 List\" as the Vassilyev family, which \"holds the record for the most children a couple has parented\".\n\nRegarding the world record of giving birth to the most number of babies by one woman, Mrs Vassilyev's name arguably appears in several websites such as \"Livescience.com\" and \"BBC.com\".\n\nAs per the BBC article, \"According to a local monastery's report to the government in Moscow, between 1725 and 1765 Mrs Vassilyev popped out 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets, over 27 separate labours. The grand total: 69 children.\"\n\nSnopes has also mentioned that her name can be found in \"The Guinness Book of World Records, 1998\". But no such credible picture of Mrs Vassilyev can be found with all her children.\n\nHence, it can be said that the image used in the viral post has no relation to the Russian woman who is claimed to be the most prolific mother with 69 offsprings.", "lang": "en"}
