At one point in the episode, Lisa\u2019s future husband, Hugh Parkfield, voiced by actor Mandy Patinkin, bent over and spoke into a strange-looking device on his wrist: a half flip phone, half wristwatch that most modern viewers would liken to a smartwatch.\n\nThis animated gadget can be glimpsed at the 2:58 mark of this video about similar Simpsons \u201cpredictions.\u201d (You can read our coverage on \u201cSimpsons\u201d predictions here.)\n\nThis is a genuine clip from a 1995 episode of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d It is also true that this episode aired more than 20 years before the \u201cYear of the Smartwatch\u201d in 2014, when these devices became relatively common. However, \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d shouldn\u2019t get credit for \u201cpredicting\u201d the smartwatch for two reasons:\n\u2022 While the \u201cYear of the Smartwatch\u201d was 2014 in name, the very first smartwatches were created before this episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d aired.\n\u2022 Variations of smartwatches have been appearing in movies, television shows, and comic books since the 1950s.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exactly when the first smartwatch was produced, because it depends on the criteria you use to classify one. The first digital watches were produced in the 1970s. In 1983, the Seiko Data-2000 featured a built-in keyboard for data input. A few years later, Sinclair made a watch with an FM radio, and in 1994 Seiko unveiled a watch that doubled as a pager. The Timex Datalink, which was also introduced in 1994, is a good contender for the first \u201cmodern\u201d smartwatch because it had the ability to transfer data by linking to a computer.\n\nThe point is that the road to the modern smartwatch has been a long and winding one that predated this episode of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these early entries into the smartwatch market, the idea of a smartwatch can be traced back even further. Special agent James Bond, for instance, has a long history of using watch gadgets to aid his spy craft. In 1973\u2019s \u201cLive and Let Die,\u201d Bond\u2019s watch was equipped with a circular saw and a magnet. In 1977\u2019s \u201cThe Spy Who Loved Me,\u201d Bond used his watch to print out tiny messages. In 1995\u2019s \u201cGolden Eye,\u201d Bond\u2019s watch was equipped with a laser.\n\nAnd Bond wasn\u2019t the only fictional character to use a dual-purpose watch. Fred Flintstone once communicated via a radio watch, as did members of \u201cThe Jetsons.\u201d Detective Dick Tracy also used a radio watch in a 1946 comic strip, and who could forget Penny\u2019s watch in \u201cInspector Gadget?\u201d\n\nIn sum, \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d didn\u2019t predict the smartwatch. While this episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d is real and truly predated the \u201cYear of the Smartwatch\u201d in 2014, this was not the first time a smartwatch appeared in a movie, comic strip, or television show. Furthermore, the evolution of the smartwatch was well underway by the time this episode aired in 1994.\n\nYou can read more about \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d alleged predictions in the Snopes\u2019 collection \u201cThe Simpsons Didn\u2019t Predict That.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
