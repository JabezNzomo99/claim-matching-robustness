Scott Walker raised the issue six days after Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who was backed by liberals, won election to the high court.\n\nHer win in the officially nonpartisan race raised hopes among Democrats of a \"blue wave\" of election victories, including denying Walker a third term in November 2018.\n\nWalker was interviewed April 9, 2018 by Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Referring to Dallet\u2019s defeat of Michael Screnock, a Sauk County circuit judge backed by Walker and other conservatives, Walker said:\n\nEven Tuesday's election for the Supreme Court -- which, in the end, kind of boiled down to a ballot test between parties, even though it's supposedly nonpartisan, and that's really because Eric Holder and his group came in and made it highly partisan.\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court races have seen partisan involvement in recent years, but the 2018 race set a new standard for partisanship.\n\nLet\u2019s see if it was Holder -- the attorney general for most of Obama\u2019s presidency, who is considering a run for president himself in 2020 -- who made the Supreme Court race \"highly partisan.\"\n\nOn March 15 and 16, 2018, Holder campaigned for Dallet in Milwaukee and Madison.\n\nAt the time, he said the group he leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, was spending $140,000 on digital ads backing Dallet and that it might spend more. Later in the campaign, it was reported that Holder\u2019s committee had spent a total of $165,000 to support Dallet.\n\nBut on election night, the group said that it and its affiliates had \"invested more than $500,000\" to elect Dallet.\n\nSo, Holder himself and his group played a major role in backing Dallet.\n\nAnd it\u2019s true that as national figures, Holder and his group added a national partisan dimension to the race.\n\nBut the Wisconsin Republican Party played a major role in backing Screnock, starting before Holder did, and it doesn\u2019t get much more partisan than a political party.\n\nFirst in -- the GOP\n\nFor example, on Nov. 9, 2017, five months before election day, the Washington County Republican Party in suburban Milwaukee gave $500 to Screnock\u2019s campaign. Later, other county parties, including those in Racine, Polk, Ozaukee, Sheboygan and Walworth counties, gave to Screnock\u2019s campaign.\n\nOn Feb. 8, 2018, the state GOP gave Screnock\u2019s campaign a $31,152 in-kind donation. And five days later, Screnock\u2019s campaign reported having received nearly $111,000 more from the GOP.\n\nOn March 27, 2018, the state party announced a statewide radio, direct mail, digital, and billboard advertisement campaign attacking Dallet.\n\nIn all, Screnock\u2019s campaign received about $400,000 in help from the state and local Republican parties, the Associated Press reported.\n\nWalker says \"Holder and his group came in and made\" the Wisconsin Supreme Court race \"highly partisan.\"\n\nHolder came to Wisconsin in March 2018, a few weeks before election day, to campaign for Dallet. And a group he leads said it and its affiliates spent more than $500,000 backing Dallet. That added a national partisan dimension to the campaign.\n\nBut you can\u2019t get any more partisan than a political party, and county Republican Party groups started backing Screnock months earlier, in November 2017. Ultimately, Republican Party groups, led by the state party, backed Screnock to the tune of some $400,000.\n\nFor a statement that contains only some truth, we give Walker a Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
