The claim says that the motto of Supreme Court has been changed from Satyamev Jayate to \u2018\u092f\u0924\u094b \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094b \u091c\u092f:\u2019 (Yato Dharmostato jayah). Vishvas News in its investigation found the claims to be false.\n\nRaj Vasava (indegenous) posted on his Twitter profile, \u201cWe are going back in 18th century again\u2026 So no more \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0947\u0935 \u091c\u092f\u0924\u0947\u0964 now \u092f\u0924\u094b \u0927\u092e\u0945\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094b \u091c\u092f\u0903 onwards. Shame on you dictator.\u201d\n\nHe shared the above content with a screenshot of the homepage of website of Supreme Court of India.\n\nCheck the archive version of the tweet here.\n\nIn the first step of the investigation, Vishvas News just used the keywords, \u201c\u092f\u0924\u094b \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094b \u091c\u092f:\u201d and searched it on the internet. The first page of search results said that \u092f\u0924\u094b \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094b \u091c\u092f is the motto of Supreme Court of India. \n\nWhich means, where there is righteousness (dharma), there is victory (jayah)\n\nVishvas News was thus sure that \u2018\u092f\u0924\u094b \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094b \u091c\u092f:\u2019 is the motto of Supreme Court of India.\n\nLater, we checked for any news reports, which said that the motto of the Supreme Court of India has been changed, however no such reports were found.\n\nLater, Vishvas News checked the website of the Supreme Court of India, where one can easily see the motto, right at the bottom of the headline.\n\nOn its Home page, one can see the option of \u2018Museum\u2018 on the left side of the website. The section gives the complete information of the Supreme Court of India. \n\nOne document that deals with the \u2018history of Supreme Court of India\u2019, says; \n\nDHARMA CHAKRA LOGO OF THE SUPREME COURT: Its design is reproduced from the wheel that appears on the abacus of the\n\n Sarnath Lion capital of Ashoka with 32 spokes. The inscription in Sanskrit \u201cyatodharmastato jayah\u201d means \u2013 Truth alone I uphold. It is also referred to \u2013 as the wheel of righteousness, encompassing truth, goodness and equity.\n\nAnother document about the history of Supreme Court of India stated,\u201dThe ground floor Gallery traces the history of Indian legal system from ancient period to British time. It depicts Indian legal system through various periods with the help of relevant texts, artifacts and other exhibits. An impression is created at the entrance of ground floor by displaying the logo of the Supreme Court (Dharamchakra upheld by the Lion Capital of 3rd Century B.C.) in an appropriate ambience.\u201c\n\nIn the last stage of the verification, Vishvas News interacted with Supreme Court Advocate, Adv Prashant Patel who had fought a year-long battle to reverse the Delhi govt decision to appoint 21 of its legislators as parliamentary secretaries in March 2015.\n\nHe informed Vishvas News that since its inception (1950), the motto of Supreme Court has been, \u2018\u092f\u0924\u094b \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094b \u091c\u092f\u0903\u2019 and not Satyamev Jayate.\n\nWe also conducted a social background check on the Twitter user who shared the claim, Raj Vasava (Indigenous) on his profile through his bio we found that he is BTP \u2013 Vice President, MP Contestant, Founder Member of BTS, Social Activist, PGD Degree holder \u2013 England, Indigenous. 3,812 people follow him on Twitter.\n\nConclusion: The motto of Supreme Court of India has always been, \u2018Yato Dharmostato Jayah\u2019 it was not Satyamev Jayate, the viral claim is false, Supreme Court has not changed its motto.", "lang": "en"}
