During that time, the U.S. government transferred more than 700 detainees from Guantanamo, and 122 of them were \"confirmed of re-engaging\" in some sort of terrorist activity.\n\nEight of those transfers happened during the Obama administration. The remaining 114 \u2014 or over 92 percent \u2014 happened under George W. Bush.\n\nSo Trump\u2019s \"hundreds and hundreds\" is really 122 combatants spread out over 15 years.\n\nTrump claimed that the United States was responsible for releasing Baghdadi back into the battlefield, but that claim is also missing key context.\n\nFrom early February 2004 until early December 2004, Baghdadi was held at a U.S. detention system known as Camp Bucca, according to the Defense Department. However, Baghdadi was not set free; he was handed over to the Iraqis in 2004, who released him some time later.\n\nIn a previous fact-check, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro falsely tied President Barack Obama to Baghdadi\u2019s release. Baghdadi was not in U.S. custody when Obama was in office.\n\nThe framework for transfers was set up while Bush was president. The legal contract between the United States and Iraq guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee. It would have required an extraordinary effort to have held on to Baghdadi, and there is no evidence that he was on anyone\u2019s radar.\n\nTrump said, \"We have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield \u2014 including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.\"\n\nTrump is overstating the number of prisoners released from Guantanamo, who were confirmed of re-engaging in some type of terrorist activity. That number is 122, not \"hundreds and hundreds.\"\n\nHe is also not entirely right that al-Baghdadi was \"released\" by the United States. The ISIS leader was was handed over to the Iraqi justice system, which released him some time later.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
