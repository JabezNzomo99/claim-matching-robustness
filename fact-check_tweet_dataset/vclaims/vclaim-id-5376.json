It was shared by IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt on both Twitter and Facebook, drawing a combined share count of over 1,400.\n\nAlthough the image is not widely circulated on social media, it has been shared by a few users.\n\nAd filmmaker Ram Subramanian also Tweeted the image but without Modi\u2019s photograph. However, he later called it \u201cincredible photoshop\u201d work after the same was pointed out to him.\n\nA reverse image search on Google reveals that Hitler\u2019s image used in the post is photoshopped. In the original image, he is not holding the child\u2019s ears but resting his hands on her shoulders. An article in The Sun has published the original image which was apparently clicked to portray the Nazi leader as \u201cpersonal friend and guardian of the German youth\u201d.\n\nMoreover, if one looks closely, PM Modi\u2019s left hand has been photoshopped as Hitler\u2019s right and his right hand as Hitler\u2019s left.\n\nFalling for morphed images on social media is a common affair. Earlier, an image of Rahul Gandhi was photoshopped with a portrait of Aurangzeb in the background. Another image was morphed to portray PM Modi surrounded by world leaders. It is advisable that images and videos circulating on social media are examined before sharing.", "lang": "en"}
