There are hundreds and thousands of people who want to hurt this kid and as [a] human rights agency, this is our job.\"\n\nGascon also got feedback from the agency's human resources department, which said that it does not have an employee going by name \"Edcel Bakunawa\" either in the central office or in regional offices (plantilla or job offer).\n\nGascon added, \"By the tenor of the so-called interview, I have doubts that this had occurred. Still, in this case, we are concerned that the rights of all children involved are respected.\"\n\nDe Guia told Rappler in a separate message that the only statement CHR issued on the Ateneo bullying incident \"is an advisory issued by CHR NCR (National Capital Region) posted on [our social media] accounts which calls for protection for both minors.\"\n\nAsked about the supposed interview, dzRH told Rappler via Facebook Messenger that it was not on their online news website, Twitter account, nor in the logs of their Tech department. \"Negative. That's fake,\" replied an administrator of its official Facebook page.\n\nThe website philnewstoday.com does not contain an \"About Us\" page. Its posts also do not have any byline.
