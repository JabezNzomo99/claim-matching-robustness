The claim is misleading; the image was taken in 2008 and has been doctored.\n\nThe photograph, which was posted here on September 18, 2018, and has been shared nearly 200 times, shows rice on sale for between 35-42 peso (67-80 US cents) a kilo.\n\nAccording to official government figures, the average retail price for rice in February 2019 was 45 peso per kilo.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, when translated to English, says: \u201cDon't believe that the price of rice is high. There is lots of cheap rice\u201d.\n\nA reverse image search found the photograph was taken by AFP in August 2008.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo on AFP's Image Forum website:\n\nThe original picture has been doctored to add a photograph of Bong Go, a close ally of President Rodrigo Duterte, who is running for a seat in the upper house Senate in May\u2019s elections.\n\nThe misleading post was shared in September 2018 but a search using IntelTechniques shows it is still being shared, for example here on February 15, 2019.\n\nThe Philippines was hit by an increase in inflation last year that saw food prices, including rice, climb.", "lang": "en"}
