No, that's not true: The claim was made in a satirical article published by a humor website targeted at military personnel and veterans, but other purported news websites copied the post as real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on May 1, 2019 titled \"Pornhub opens first SIPR website\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nPornhub is a Canadian-based company that markets sexually-explicit websites. SIPR is the acronym for \"a system of interconnected computer networks used by the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of State to transmit classified information (up to and including information classified SECRET) by packet switching over the 'completely secure' environment.\"\n\nThe satirical story said the establishment of the SIPR website was intended to improve troop morale.\n\nThe website Duffelblog.com is a military-themed satire website which sports following legal disclaimer on its 'about' page:\n\nWe are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet. Everything on this website is satirical and the content of this site is a parody of a news organization. No composition should be regarded as truthful, and no reference of an individual, company, or military unit seeks to inflict malice or emotional harm. All characters, groups, and military units appearing in these works are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, or actual military units and companies is purely coincidental.\n\nThey are sometimes refered to as the military version of The Onion but that same 'about' page points out:\n\nDuffel Blog is sometimes referred to as \"The military version of The Onion,\" but this is a misnomer. The gaffe was cleared up in May 2012 when Duffel Blog staff successfully conducted an airborne assault on the offices of The Onion News Network so that others would know \"The Onion was actually the civilian version of Duffel Blog.\"\n\nSo don't fall for any of their stories...\n\nWe wrote about duffelblog.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Nike Did NOT Apologize For Forgetting Military Monopoly on Sacrifice\n\u2022 Fake News: Navy Did NOT Approve Man-buns For Sailors\n\u2022 Fake News: Trump Tower Did NOT Open in Pyongyang", "lang": "en"}
