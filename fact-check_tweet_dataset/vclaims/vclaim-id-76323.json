Ted Cruz negotiating with Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump to serve as Trump\u2019s November 2016 running mate.\n\nBut wait--where\u2019s the breathless CNN report, the insiders analysis on Fox News or even the basic newspaper scoop?\n\nWe found nothing of the sort in online searches or in the Nexis news database and when we asked Cruz\u2019s campaign about the Feb. 25, 2016, Elect Leaders post, spokesman Brian Phillips replied by email: \"Is this a serious request?\"\n\nWell, the Cruz-negotiating-with-Trump item, also posted on ElectLeaders.com, which describes itself as keeping \"watch on our leaders and wannabe leaders,\" has a little traction. When we saw the headline March 21, 2016, the post had been shared on Facebook more than 34,000 times.\n\nAnd history shows a joint ticket could play out. In 2008, Barack Obama chose to run with a failed presidential hopeful, Joe Biden. In 1980, Ronald Reagan reached out to the defeated George H.W. Bush. Twenty years before, Democrat John F. Kennedy picked Texan Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nSo Trump-Cruz, pairing the frontrunner with the fellow running second, is possible.\n\nOn the other hand, Phillips followed up with an email calling the post \"categorically false.\"\n\nFor our part, we noticed a red flag in that the Elect Leaders item doesn\u2019t quote named sources, not even a campaign spokeswoman offering a \"no comment.\"\n\nHere\u2019s what the post says: \"A high ranking Cruz campaign official has told Elect Leaders that Sen. Cruz is in negotiations with Mr. Trump to become his Vice Presidential Nominee after Rubio dropped out Tuesday.\" That\u2019s confusing timewise in that Sen. Marco Rubio dropped his presidential bid Tuesday March 15, 2016, after falling short of victory in his home state of Florida.\n\nThe item goes on to say Cruz \"has been the most consistent performer in primaries behind Trump. They are seeing the writing on the wall and want to negotiate from a point of strength which will evaporate over time.\"\n\n\"The official,\" again unnamed, \"stated Mr. Trump is interested in using Sen. Cruz\u2019s ground game in the general election, likes his appeal to the conservative base and his stance on immigration. Of the other options for VP none hold as strong of an opinion on immigration outside of Gov. Jan Brewer from Arizona who is also being considered.\" Brewer, by the way, is no longer governor.\n\nFinally, the post says, Cruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, has an eye on shifting from vice president to the Supreme Court. Cruz, the item says, \"in exchange for his support is wanting to be named to the Supreme Court if an opening occurs while Mr. Trump is president. Mr. Trump does not see this as an issue and a small price to pay to bring Sen. Cruz his fundraisers, donors and staff on board,\" the post says.\n\nWe tried to reach out to Elect Leaders about the post and didn\u2019t hear back. Otherwise, we found no indication Trump-Cruz negotiations were (or are) afoot.\n\nIn November 2015 -- eons ago in politicking time maybe especially given Trump\u2019s references to Cruz as \"Lyin\u2019 Ted\"-- Trump told conservative talk-show host Laura Ingraham that Cruz might be his choice for the No. 2 slot. To be fair, Trump declined to name a potential running mate from among his GOP opponents before noting his affection for Cruz. \"Well, I like like him,\" Trump said at the time. \"He\u2019s backed everything I\u2019ve said \u2026 Ted Cruz is now agreeing with me 100 percent.\"\n\nBut Trump also didn\u2019t go further down the veep path, saying: \"I like to think of victory, I\u2019ve had a lot of victories, and I like to do victories first, then start thinking about other things.\"\n\nCruz, meantime, said March 15, 2016 that he wasn\u2019t inclined to join Trump on a single ticket, if offered the vice presidency.\n\nConservative talk-show host Hugh Hewitt asked if Cruz \"would ever agree to serve as\" Trump\u2019s \"vice president?\"\n\n\"I have absolutely zero interest in doing that,\" Cruz replied, going on to say he expected to overtake Trump and win the delegates needed to secure the presidential nomination. And on March 21, 2016, just before we completed this fact check, Cruz told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer: \"I have zero interest whatsoever\" in being Trump\u2019s running mate. Blitzer had asked Cruz about the possibility by noting Trump earlier responded to Blitzer\u2019s question about choosing Cruz as his running mate by saying: \"Crazier things happen in politics.\"\n\nOn Facebook, Elect Leaders said Cruz and Trump are negotiating a Trump-Cruz Republican ticket.\n\nAnything is possible. But we don't see evidence the two camps are lately plotting a shared ticket.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
