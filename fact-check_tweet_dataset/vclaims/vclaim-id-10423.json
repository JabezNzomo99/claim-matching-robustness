Gary Alejano will have President Rodrigo Duterte arrested for the war on drugs. \n\n\n\nThe story used a video from YouTube page, President Rodrigo Duterte Updates, showing Alejano holding an April 13 press briefing at the House of Representatives. The opposition lawmaker offered recommendations on how the government should fight drugs but made no mention of arresting Duterte.\n\nThree days before the story was posted, Duterte threatened to arrest International Criminal Court prosecutor Fatou Bensouda if she pushes through with the review of alleged extrajudicial killings in the country.\n\nAlejano and Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV filed a supplemental communication to the ICC in June 2017 to conduct the investigation.\n\nThe biggest traffic generators of the story are Marcos Loyalist, Exclusive DDS Marcos the 3rd Force, and BongBong Marcos United, and could have reached more than 900,000 social media users.\n\nEditor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.", "lang": "en"}
