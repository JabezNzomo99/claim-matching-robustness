A viral post on social media claims that the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains 2020 has been canceled at many centers in Lucknow. This claim has proven to be fake in Vishvas News investigation. The JEE exam has not been canceled at any center in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nA Twitter user named \u2018Aisa Madhya Pradesh\u2019 wrote, \u201cIn Lucknow, JEE paper was cancelled in many centers. It\u2019s better to postpone exam.\n\nThis post was shared on September 1, 2020. The archived version of this post can be accessed here.\n\nSeveral users have shared similar posts on twitter.\n\nFirst of all, we searched on Google for JEE Mains 2020 exam date. We found the exam was scheduled on September 1. We searched the news about cancellation of exam in Lucknow on Google, but we did not find any such report. We researched the e-paper of Dainik Jagran\u2019s Lucknow edition. There we did not get any notice of cancellation of exam at some centers.\n\nThe National Testing Agency (NTA) is the in-charge authority in conducting these exams. We did not get any notice of the cancellation of the exam at their website.\n\nThe National Testing Agency has clarified the claims to be fake in their tweet. Exams were not to be held at Krishna Nagar and Jankipuram Extension of Lucknow. The exams were conducted at other centers in Lucknow.\n\nVishwas News spoke to Dainik Jagran\u2019s Lucknow correspondent Pulak Tripathi to verify the claim. He said that on Tuesday (September 1, 2020), there was JEE main exam for Bachelor of Architecture. \u201cThere were fewer participants for this course. For this reason, this examination was conducted at only three centers out of nine. He said that the rumor of cancellation of the examination might have arised due to less number of centers. The viral claim is fake,\u201d said Tripathi.\n\nIn social scanning of the Twitter user \u2018Aisa Madhya Pradesh\u2019, we came to know that the user is from Madhya Pradesh and the account is active on Twitter since July 2020.\n\nConclusion: JEE 2020 exams were not cancelled at some centers in Lucknow.", "lang": "en"}
