He did ask in one of his works, \u201cOnce thoroughly broken down, who is he that can repair the damage?\u201d\n\nDouglass, a well-known orator and statesman who fought for the abolition of slavery, was a prolific writer and highly quotable. However, the quote in the image cannot be attributed to him with any certainty.\n\nNeither the quote nor any variation of it appears in Douglass\u2019 collected writings, including his 1845 memoir. New York Times opinion columnist Charles Blow, among others, have attributed the quote to Douglass without any citation.\n\nThe Caller spoke with two professors who have studied the life of Douglass extensively and neither could identify it as genuine. \u201cI have never found it in any Douglass speech or writing. I regard it as apocrypha\u200b,\u201d Professor Jack Kaufman-McKivigan of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis told the Caller in an email.\n\nThe closest quotation the Caller could find was in Douglass\u2019 \u201cMy Bondage and My Freedom,\u201d where he asked, \u201cOnce thoroughly broken down, who is he that can repair the damage?\u201d\n\nWilliam Cheng, an associate professor at Dartmouth University, researched the quote as well, finding a handful of newspaper articles circulating the expression between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s. The earliest instances he could find of the quote being attributed to Douglass was from a 1994 advertisement.", "lang": "en"}
