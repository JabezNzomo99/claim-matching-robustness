This is a piece of fan art showing what the helmets could look like if the sport returns during the pandemic.\n\nThis image did not originate with any of the NFL\u2019s official channels, nor was it shared by Nike, the company that is providing the uniforms for the NFL this year. This image originated on the Stadium Facebook page, where it was shared with the caption: \u201cNFL players might sport #COVID19 helmets this fall \u2026 What do you think? \ud83d\udc40\u201d The keyword in the previous sentence, of course, is might, but even that implies too strong of a connection between this image and the NFL.\n\nThe above-displayed image was created by manipulating a real picture released in 2012 of Nike\u2019s latest NFL uniform designs:\n\nWhile the COVID-19 series NFL helmet shown above is an unofficial concept design, the NFL is reportedly working on new helmet face guards to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWith an eye toward getting back on the field during a pandemic, the NFL is working on a helmet face guard that might provide the same sort of protection as a surgical mask. Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay, who heads up the league\u2019s competition committee, said the issue was raised during a conference call about a month ago. \u201cA lot of players have played with a clear shield to protect their eyes,\u201d McKay said Tuesday during a video conference call with Atlanta media. \u201cThis would be extended even further.\u201d Thom Mayer, who is medical director of the NFL Players Association, said league engineers and sports equipment company Oakley are testing prototypes of a modified face mask that might contain surgical or N95 material.\n\nAs of this writing, the NFL has not released any images showing what these COVID-19 helmets could look like.", "lang": "en"}
