(\u0907\u0938 \u091c\u0939\u093e\u091c \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u0948\u0920\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915 \u0915\u0947 \u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u091f\u094d\u0930\u0948\u0915\u094d\u091f\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u0917\u0947 \u0915\u0941\u0936\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0915\u0924 \u0925\u0940!)\u201d\n\nHis tweet was in reference to Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri\u2019s swipe at Congress MP Rahul Gandhi over images that showed him sitting on what appeared to be cushioned seats on a tractor. This was during a rally in Punjab to protest against the Modi government\u2019s controversial farm laws.\n\nPoet Imran Pratapgrahi also shared the same picture.\n\nOn August 1, the official handle of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) tweeted the photograph and wrote, \u201cThere was Gandhiji who never fully covered his body because more than half of the population did not have clothes to wear.\u201d The tweet was liked by over 2,300 users and retweeted 364 times. (archived link of the tweet)\n\nOn the same day, this picture was also tweeted by Jitu Patwari, who is the in-charge of Gujarat Congress and working president of Madhya Pradesh Congress. He claimed that the plane is PM Modi\u2019s private aircraft. Patwari mockingly remarked that \u2018the PM would make India a superpower only when he is given luxuries\u2019. Before his tweet was deleted, it had received more than 1,100 likes and 221 retweets (archived link of the tweet). After Patwari\u2019s tweet, the picture began widely circulating on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nHaryana Congress leader Pankaj Punia also tweeted the picture along with a news report about Boeing 777 aircraft arriving in September 2020 for the Prime Minister\u2019s use.\n\nThe picture was posted on the Facebook page of UP East Youth Congress with the same claim that this is the Boeing 777 aircraft.\n\nUpon conducting a reverse image search, it was found that the luxurious airplane is Mexico\u2019s Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and not PM Modi\u2019s private airplane. The picture was first shared on November 10, 2015, on a website which said that it is a private plane.\n\nA Google search confirms that the picture is indeed of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is manufactured by American company Boeing Commercial Airplane. This particular airplane is specially made for commercial purposes. Since September 2016, the responsibility of managing Boeing 787 Dreamliner was taken over by China-based Deer Jet. More pictures of Boeing 787 Dreamliner were found on the website of Deer Jet. The website also mentions that the aircraft was made in 2.5 years by a French designer and it can travel non-stop for 17 hours.\n\nOn November 17, 2017, Australian-Chinese blogger Sam Chui had uploaded a video on YouTube showing the interiors of Boeing 787 Dreamliner. You can see the same frame as shown in the recent viral picture at 2:09 minutes into the video.\n\nThe Indian President, Vice-President and Prime Minister use Boeing 747 for their travel. According to an article published on October 10, 2019, by India Today, two Boeing 777 airplanes will be brought to India for the President, VP and PM\u2019s use by July 2020. As per a new update, the airplanes are expected to arrive by September 2020.\n\nIn this manner, a picture of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is being misrepresented and widely shared on social media as PM Modi\u2019s private airplane. Photos of the interiors of Boeing B777 aircraft or Air India One (AI-160) have been published by the media.", "lang": "en"}
