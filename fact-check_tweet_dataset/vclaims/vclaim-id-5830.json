This long-standing false claim has been circulating online since 2003.\n\nThe image reads: \u201c12:30 Aug 27th you will see two moons in the sky, but only one will be the moon. The other will be Mars. It won\u2019t happen again until 2287. No one alive today has ever witnessed this happening.\u201d\n\nWhile this claim has been circulating and has been debunked since 2003 ( here , here ), users have been reposting it recently.\n\nA post featuring the claim with over 586,000 shares is visible here (See other posts here and here )\n\nThe claim goes back to a 2003 email commonly known as the \u201cMars Hoax\u201d or \u201cMars Spectacular\u201d ( here ). The popular message, which originally contained mostly accurate information, aimed to inform recipients about an authentic extreme close encounter between Mars and Earth that would culminate on Aug. 27, 2003, an event known as \u201cperihelic opposition\u201d ( go.nasa.gov/3ao9j6L ). On that day, Mars and Earth were within 55,758,006 km of each other, which was the closest the planets had been in 60,000 years and the closest the two planets will be until Aug. 28, 2287 ( go.nasa.gov/33XSEpy ).\n\nA NASA article debunking the claim here explains that early versions of the email did state that Mars would \u201clook as big as the full Moon to the naked eye\u201d but only \u201cat the modest 75 times magnification,\u201d inviting the recipients to use a telescope to see the event. This detail about magnification was then omitted in further iterations of the message.\n\nShelley Witte, an astronomy educator at the National Air and Space Museum, gave more context here about what happened in the sky on Aug. 27, 2003. \u201cTo the naked eye, Mars appeared as bright, reddish, star-like object during the 2003 opposition (\u2026) Compared to the full Moon, Mars was only 1/75 of its size - certainly not a second Moon in the sky\u201d.\n\nOn this \u201ctoo fantastic to be true\u201d claim, Witte concludes that \u201cif Mars does appear as our \u2018second moon\u2019, something has gone terribly wrong with the inner solar system or the laws of physics.\u201d\n\nNBC reported that the image of the claim first appeared in 2009 \u201con a Russian site called \u2018Dream Worlds\u2019, as part of a gallery of fanciful double-moon images.\u201d ( here ) An archived version of the website is visible bit.ly/2E55VRZ (image toward the bottom of the list).\n\nThe edited image appears to show the Nilo-Stolobensky Monastery on Stolobny Island in Russia (photos showing similar angles bit.ly/3gSSza4 and bit.ly/3ajGU1G ).\n\nFalse. Mars will not appear to be as big as the moon on Aug. 27, it is an old, debunked \u201ctwo moon hoax\u201d.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
