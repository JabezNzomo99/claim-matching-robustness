The rest are either misleading, inaccurate, or unsubstantiated.\n\nOn July 31, Facebook (FB) page Philippine Health Tips, which posts herbal cures and health benefits of various plants on an almost-daily basis, published on FB a post titled,\n\nCiting several unidentified studies which supposedly tested the effects of sweet potato leaves and their extract on humans and mice, the page also claimed the following:\n\u2022 the extract slows the growth of prostate cancer tumors in mice by 75%;\n\u2022 sweet potato leaves are \u201cactive against\u201d leukemia, as well as breast, lung, colon, and stomach cancer;\n\u2022 eating at least 100 grams per week of the leaves \u201cdecreases lung cancer risk by up to 57%\u201d;\n\u2022 the plant\u2019s leaves \u201cboosts immunity\u201d in humans and lowers blood sugar in mice with type II diabetes;\n\u2022 sweet potato leaves are \u201can excellent source\u201d of antioxidants called polyphenols, and anticancer peptides;\n\u2022 it gives \u201c400% the alkalizing (sic) power of pure lemon juice\u201d; and\n\u2022 the leaves significantly relieved fatigue in mice, increased exercise capacity, and boosted muscle glycogen levels.\n\nTo date, the post has been shared over 84,000 times.\n\nOnly the claims about the effect of sweet potato leaves and extract on mice are true, as well as the statement about the plant containing antioxidants.\n\nThe two claims that the plant can fight specific cancers in humans are skewed, while Philippine Health Tips\u2019 claims of its lung-cancer-preventing capabilities carry inaccuracies. The claim on its \u201calkalizing (sic) power,\u201d on the other hand, is unsubstantiated.\n\nOn being extremely toxic to prostate cancer cells, killing 94% in vitro\n\nPhilippine Health Tips\u2019 main claim is misleading. The FB page did not specify which study this came from, but it appears to refer to a 2011 research from the Oxford Journals on Carcinogenesis. The study did not say the extract is \u201cextremely toxic\u201d to prostate cancer cells, but did find that it had significant, \u201cantiproliferative\u201d effect on prostate cancer cells -- meaning it prevents cancerous cells from reproducing -- while not causing any \u201cdetectable toxicity\u201d on normal prostate cells. It also induced \u201capoptosis\u201d or cell self-destruction in human prostate cancer cells.\n\nThe research was done on prostate cancer cells in vitro, or in an artificial setting like test tubes or petri dishes, and in vivo, or inside a living organism\u2019s body. The study did not say 94 percent of cancerous cells were killed in vitro. What it did observe was that oral intake of the extract \u201cinhibited growth and progression\u201d of prostate tumors by about 69 percent in lab mice.\n\nOn being \u201cactive\u201d against breast, lung, colon and stomach cancer and leukemia\n\nWhile several studies have indeed found that sweet potato leaves and its extract can fight colon and stomach cancer and leukemia, and can help prevent lung cancer, the leaves\u2019 efficacy against breast cancer cells has yet to be proven. However, there are published studies not on the leaves but on the root crop\u2019s anti-breast cancer activities, such as a 2015 research in Taiwan, and a 2017 and 2019 study in China.\n\nOn decreasing the risk of lung cancer by 57% by eating 100g of sweet potato leaves weekly\n\nA research conducted in Taiwan on the matter did not make specific mention of a 57 percent decrease in lung cancer risk caused by the intake of sweet potato greens. Instead, its results pointed out what most people know: that eating more servings of vegetables, chrysanthemum, and sweet potato leaves -- which are all rich in vitamin A -- decreases the chances of an individual developing lung cancer.\n\nOn having 400% the alkalizing power of pure lemon juice\n\nThis claim lacks proof. There are no scientific studies pointing to sweet potato leaves or its extract having 400 percent more alkaline than lemon juice.\n\nOn boosting the immune system of humans and lowering blood sugar in diabetic mice\n\nA 2005 study in Taiwan on the effect of purple sweet potato leaves does show it can help in regulating a human\u2019s immune functions, proving the former claim, while a 2014 experiment in Japan on how sweet potato greens extract (SPGE) weakens hyperglycemia or high blood sugar in mice, showing an antidiabetic potential of sweet potato leaves, validates the latter.\n\nOn being a source of polyphenols and anticancer peptides\n\nSeveral studies cited in this story prove that sweet potato leaves contain polyphenols and anticancer peptides, specifically the 2007 study which discovered that the spread of colon, stomach, and leukemia cancer cells could be suppressed by a substance found in the polyphenols of sweet potato greens.\n\nOn sweet potato extract slowing the growth of prostate tumors in mice by 75%\n\nA 2013 study by the same researchers of the 2011 in vivo and in vitro research mentioned above found that ingesting a polyphenol-rich portion of sweet potato green extract could hinder the development of prostate tumor in mice by approximately 75 percent.\n\nOn relieving fatigue, increasing exercise capacity and muscle glucose in mice\n\nThe claim pertains to a 2013 research published in the Indian Journal of Biochemistry & Biophysics. It looked into the anti-fatigue effects of flavonoids found in sweet potato greens. Flavonoids are phytochemicals reported to have \u201cantiviral, anti-allergic, anti-platelet, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidant activities.\u201d\n\nThe male Kunming mice, which received flavonoids from sweet potato leaves during the experiment, were able to swim longer and had higher muscle glucose content or stored energy after performing the exercise.\n\nKarna, P., Gundala, S.
