The government-owned news agency RIA Novosti posted a total of seven articles on the topic in a single day, including a caricature of Browder with the caption \u201cSiberia is calling.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the annual Valdai Club meeting in Sochi several days earlier, on October 19, Putin stated that the Ziff Brothers Investments LLC, which has invested with Browder, is \u201cfunding the Democratic Party, [and] the Republican [Party] in a much smaller volume.\u201d Putin added: \u201cThey protect themselves that way.\u201d\n\nThe Russian president also said that the Magnitsky Act is used to whip up \u201cyet another anti-Russian hysteria.\u201d\n\nThe Magnitsky Act is the U.S. law adopted in 2012 that imposed sanctions on Russian officials responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, the Russian lawyer who worked for Browder before dying in a Moscow prison in 2009. The law is also used to impose sanctions on those responsible for other human rights abuses in Russia.\n\nTwo days after Putin's Valdai Club statement, on October 21, Russian media reported that Moscow had added Browder to Interpol\u2019s most wanted list, triggering a Red Notice for his arrest.\n\nFollowing reports of the U.S. visa revocation, Russian political analyst Irina Alsknis wrote in an op-ed for RIA Novosti that \u201cthe U.S. has betrayed Browder,\u201d describing him as a \u201cpawn who imagined himself a queen.\u201d\n\nInterpol, an international police organization with 192 member countries, describes its role as seeking \u201cto enable police around the world to work together to make the world a safer place.\u201d\n\nRussia is a member of Interpol, with a Central Bureau in Moscow and 80 regional divisions across the country.\n\nAccording to Article 1 (8) of the Interpol\u2019s Rules on the Processing of Data, Russia, as a nation with a designated Interpol Central Bureau, is authorized to \u201cdirectly provide data for processing purposes\u201d in Interpol\u2019s global system.\n\nThe Interpol system is organized in such a way that immediately after a person\u2019s data is added to the wanted list, the \u201cRed Notice\u201d goes out to all Interpol member states, activating security procedures, including revocation of any existing visas.\n\nContrary to the Russian claims of a \u201cU.S. betrayal,\u201d the news that Browder\u2019s U.S. visa had been revoked triggered a storm of statements from the top American politicians demanding that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security immediately rectify the issue.\n\n\u201cBill Browder is a champion of anti-corruption in #Russia. DHS must immediately review decision to revoke his visa,\u201d Senator John McCain wrote on Twitter.\n\nThat same day, October 23, Senators John McCain and Ben Cardin issued a joint statement.\n\n\u201cWe understand that William Browder\u2019s U.S. visa has been revoked due his inclusion on the Interpol list,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAccording to Browder, the Russian government has submitted his name for inclusion on the Interpol list on several occasions in the past, yet it was rejected as politically motivated. And through these episodes, his U.S. visa status has been immediately reinstated. The Department of Homeland Security should expedite an immediate review of the decision to revoke Mr. Browder\u2019s visa.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the U.S. State Department indicated Browder\u2019s eligibility to travel to the country falls under the Visa Waiver Program. The government said Browder\u2019s application was made under the \u201cElectronic System for Travel Authorization,\u201d (ESTA). The U.S. DHS stated that when confronted with possible derogatory information, it conducts a \u201cmanual\u201d review of the ESTA application.\n\n\u201cWilliam Browder\u2019s ESTA remains valid for travel to the United States,\u201d DHS wrote. \u201cHis ESTA was manually approved by CBP (Customs and Border Patrol) on Oct. 18\u2014clearing him for travel to the United States.\u201d That is one day after media reports indicate Russia asked Interpol to put out a \u201cRed Notice\u201d on Browder.\n\n\u201cGREAT NEWS! My ESTA (US visa waiver) was restored. I successfully checked into a US flight. Now we need to fix bogus Interpol arrest warrant,\u201d Browder tweeted from London on October 23.\n\nAs of October 24, Browder\u2019s name was no longer listed among Interpol\u2019s Red Notices.\n\nAccording to Browder, this latest Red Notice was the fifth attempt by the Russian government to use Interpol to label him an international criminal. He linked Russia\u2019s renewed efforts with Canada\u2019s adoption of the Global Magnitsky Act last week.\n\nThere are currently 160 persons on Interpol\u2019s list of most wanted criminals who were added by the Russian Federation.", "lang": "en"}
