It was reshared to Facebook by hyper-partisan pages such as We Support PDu30 Administration and We Support Bongbong Marcos, Marcos Loyalist, and DDS for Life.\n\nThe facts: Lee Kuan Yew never said those words. The quote was the opinion of the blog author and was falsely attributed to Singapore's former prime minister.\n\nThe title of the blog, however, references the speech delivered by Lee during the Philippine Business Conference on November 18, 1992. The following is an excerpt from his speech based on the records of the National Archives of Singapore:\n\n\"Contrary to what American political commentators say, I do not believe that democracy necessarily leads to development. I believe that what a country needs to develop is discipline more than democracy.\"\n\nBesides this part, Singapore's founding father did not mention anything about the poor state of democracy in the country as a consequence of having \"a stupid government and a stupid people.\"\n\n\n\nThe image used in the claim originated from Getty images with its watermark removed and replaced with the name \"VincentMarcus.\" The photo was taken by Bloomberg photojournalist Jonathan Drake.\n\nThe website makingitfuninthephilippines.blogspot.com described itself as \"Just another blog ranting with facts and opinions concerning the Philippines' welfare.\" Its author uses the pen name Sean Akizuki. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
