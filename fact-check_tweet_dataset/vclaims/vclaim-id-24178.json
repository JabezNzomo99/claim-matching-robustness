Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: Modi pays tributes to both Mahatma Gandhi and his murderer Nathuram Godse. Fact: In the photo on the right side of the collage, Modi was paying tributes to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, the founder of Bharatiya Jana Sangh (the present Bharatiya Janata Party). So, the claim in the post stands FALSE.\n\nOn cropping the left and right images in the collage and running them through Google Reverse Image search technique, the image on the left was found to be taken when Modi inaugurated Mahatma Gandhi Museum at Rajkot, Gujarat. The image on the right was found to be the one taken when Narendra Modi paid tributes to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, the founder of Bharatiya Jana Sangh (the present Bharatiya Janata Party). Every year, Pandit Deen Dayal\u2019s birthday is celebrated as BJP Sthapana Diwas. So, on April 6, 2017, Modi along with his party men Amit Shah, Venkaiah Naidu and Suresh Prabhu has offered his respects to Deen Dayal during the party\u2019s 38th Foundation day celebrations.\n\nTo sum it up, Modi wasn\u2019t paying tributes to Godse. He was offering his respects to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay.", "lang": "en"}
