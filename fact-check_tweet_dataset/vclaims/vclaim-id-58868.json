The claim is false; the video has been created using two separate clips which do not state that Chan is offering donations to those affected by COVID-19; the first clip was originally published on Chan's official Facebook account in April 2020; the second clip was taken from a 2017 post on the Instagram page of US boxer Floyd Mayweather.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on July 7, 2020. It has been viewed more than 1.7 million times and shared 54,000 times.\n\nIt was shared here in a Myanmar-based Facebook group.\n\nThe 42-second clip is a split screen video that features Chan speaking on the left, and stacks of British and euro banknotes on the right.\n\nThe text superimposed on the video reads: \u201cSTAY AT HOME. Jackie Chan gift money\u201d.\n\nThe post reads, in part: \"for all countries .. !!!

I know it is a very difficult time for everyone right now. And we all face the same problem - the coronavirus....Protecting yourself is protecting your family. Stay safe. Stay strong. I too believe we have a brighter future ahead.
