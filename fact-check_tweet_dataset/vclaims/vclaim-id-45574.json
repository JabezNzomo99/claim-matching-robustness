I noticed this portrait of Japan's prime minister Shinzo Uzumaki Jotaro Abe next to the president of the Philippines president Duterte. Displayed in front of one of the national museums here in Japan.\"\n\nThis profile on the official website for the Japanese prime minister indicates his name is actually \"Shinzo Abe\", not \"Shinzo Uzumaki Jotaro Abe\".\n\nThe same photo was shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nA combined reverse image and keyword search on Google found the image was digitally manipulated to include Abe\u2019s portrait. The original photo was taken in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.\n\nThe original photo, which clearly shows portraits of Duterte and Jokowi, was published on September 8, 2016 on Twitter here by a reporter for GMA News Online, a Philippine media organisation. The tweet was embedded in this GMA article on the same day.\n\n\u201cA portrait of President Rodrigo Duterte has been displayed at the National Monument in Central Jakarta, Indonesia as the country awaits his arrival,\u201d the GMA report states. \u201c[Duterte\u2019s photo] was placed beside the portrait of Indonesian President Joko Widodo.\u201d\n\nThe article adds that \u201cIndonesia is Duterte's second stop in his tour of neighboring Southeast Asian countries for his first international travel as head of state.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the doctored photo (L) and the original photo which shows Jokowi (R):\n\nThe photo showing the portraits of Duterte and Jokowi also appeared in this report published by Indonesian news site IDN Times on September 9, 2016.\n\nThe location where the portraits were displayed in Jakarta in 2016 can be viewed here on Google Street View.", "lang": "en"}
