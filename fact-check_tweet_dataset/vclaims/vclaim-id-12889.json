Further, despite reports that the man was not found for six months after his death, the Nikkan-Spa! simply reported that the unidentified man\u2019s body was found a month later.\n\nGruesomely, the story notes that the pornography soaked up his \u201cbody fluids,\u201d which would normally cause an odor and alert neighbors of his death. \u201cAlthough it is nightmare talk, this is reality,\u201d the article says.\n\nThe phenomenon of solitary deaths, or kodokushi, has been a concern in Japan since at least 2005:\n\nAccording to the Japan Quality of Life Survey, conducted in 2013 by the Japanese government\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute, 32% of respondents reported that they were somewhat or very concerned about dying alone. According to our own analysis of the data, the worries are negatively correlated with subjective well-being. Worries about solitary death show one of the highest negative correlations with happiness.\n\nJapanese national broadcasting company NHK tied the phenomenon to a society without bonds, where people have lost their connection to family, neighbors, and colleagues.", "lang": "en"}
