This data covers employees and self-employed people (99% of the total workforce), and the retail sector excludes people working in car or motorcycle garages.\n\nThis data doesn\u2019t cover the most recent quarter of 2018 (Q2) as the PA\u2019s figures do, and doesn\u2019t cover those job losses that have been announced but not yet occurred. Also the number of people in employment is slightly different from the number of jobs (e.g. one person in employment can have two jobs).\n\nBut it does provide more accurate and useful data for understanding the health of the retail jobs market.\n\nOne important thing the figures show is that retail jobs are seasonal and so looking at changes from quarter to quarter isn\u2019t that helpful in terms of understanding the overall trend. The data also show that the estimates for retail job losses this year are similar to previous years.\n\nThe data shows that since records began in 1997, there has always been fewer people employed in retail in the middle of the year compared to the end of the previous year. The drop of 84,000 is below average.\n\nThere has also been a fall from Q4 to Q2 in every year, so the PA\u2019s finding that retail jobs have fallen in the first half of this year is also true of every other year since records began.\n\nBy looking at yearly averages, we can better understand the long term trend in retail jobs.\n\nThe data estimates that the number of people employed in retail is relatively stable over the past few years but is not keeping pace with job growth in the rest of the economy.\n\nIn summary, the falls we\u2019ve seen so far this year do not mark 2018 out as a particularly bad year for retail employment \u2013 although those figures don\u2019t yet account for the second three months of the year. But more broadly job growth in the retail sector has been lagging behind growth in other sectors over the past decade.", "lang": "en"}
