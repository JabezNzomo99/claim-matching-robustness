Since then, it was shared 8 times in different Facebook pages and groups. All of these resulted in 3,020 interactions and attracted 1,778,612 followers.\n\n\u201cThe book 'Ninoy, Cory, and Noynoy' was released in 2012, years before the 2016 elections. Majority of the copies were sold, but Summit has pulled out copies throughout the years, as part of standard circulation practice. Books in shelves for more than two years are pulled out regularly to make way for new releases, and not necessarily because of low sales,\u201d said Summit Books Junior Associate Publisher Ishi Castro.\n\nMeanwhile, all 3 posts did not specify when the books were pulled out and also quoted a certain Cloyd Gallardo, a \u201cbranch manager of a major bookstore.\u201d Gallardo\u2019s supposed quote reads:\n\nSad to say, the Cory Magic is gone and many Filipinos are now saying they're not satisfied with Noynoy\u2019s performance. As book sellers, we need to remove all our copies from our shelves because they only consume space.\n\nA Facebook search of the same name leads to only one user named Johncloyd Gallardo. A browse of his timeline shows no relationship with any publishers or bookstores.\n\n\n\nRappler has also contacted National Book Store and Fully Booked to inquire whether they have or had a staff member named Cloyd Gallardo. They have yet to respond.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
