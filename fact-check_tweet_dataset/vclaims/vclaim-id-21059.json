Step one: finding out what Peters meant when she attributed deaths to the \u201cmale stubborn and chauvinistic attitude\u201d.\n\nThe minister\u2019s spokesman, Ishmael Mnisi, told Africa Check in an email that Peters\u2019 comments refer to \u201can attitude of superiority towards females. This is done by openly displaying their financial accumulations, masculinity using their vehicles capacity to move fast and the display of the car technical capacity.\u201d\n\na link between gender and road traffic deaths, researcher Roger Behrens from the\n\nMore men tend to die on South Africa's roads than women and a\n\nof road crashes, deaths and injuries for the Western Cape provincial transport department in 2010. It showed that 37.3% of 711 traffic deaths in 2007 were of drivers. Only 8% of the drivers who died were women, though they were behind the wheel in 25% of the crashes.\n\nResearcher Marianne Vanderschuren explained that this \u201cis where we are certain about the difference in behaviour causing this\u201d. In the report, Vanderschuren recommended that the department\u2019s road safety education specifically focus on young men and young male drivers \u201cas they are the main group responsible for road crashes, even if they themselves are not always the fatality\u201d.\n\nThat said, the 78.4% figure that Peters referred to did not only include male drivers - who may have caused the crash in which they died - but all male pedestrians, passengers and cyclists who died in the period. The RTMC\u2019s Moloto confirmed this to Africa Check.\n\nFurthermore, the figure doesn\u2019t tell us what caused the fatal car crashes. Male chauvinism would count as a human factor, one of three categories to which crashes are attributed.\n\nThe bulk of male deaths in the first weeks of December fell into this human factor category, at 81.9%.\n\nHowever, human factors do not necessarily equal driver error. A breakdown of p\n\nreliminary figures Moloto shared for the whole month showed that more than a quarter of men and boys who died due to human factors were jaywalking.\n\nTo facilitate this, the Road Traffic Management Corporation can help by making datasets readily and frequently available.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s minister of transport claimed that 78.4% of male deaths during the first 19 days of December 2016 could be accounted for by \u201cthe stubborn and chauvinistic male attitude\u201d.\n\nData from the Road Traffic Management Corporation showed that the figure related to all the men and boys that died in crashes. This included cyclists and pedestrians (and excluded men who survived an accident they caused).\n\nFurther, while the men and boys overwhelmingly died due to human factors, contributing factors to do with vehicles (such as tyres that burst) or the environment (such as poor visibility) played a role in close to 20% of the deaths.\n\nExperts confirmed a link between road deaths and gender, citing differences in risk-taking behaviour between men and women as a\n\nexplanation. However, they told Africa Check that chauvinist attitudes speak more to perceptions that may be held by drivers than actual causes of crashes.\n\nSolving a problem requires a thorough understanding of its causes. In few other social matters in South Africa is this more important than road safety.\n\nFigure includes male pedestrians & cyclists who died, among other caveatsSunshine and matric results are synonymous with South Africa\u2019s festive season - as is the country\u2019s road death toll, sadly.So even if we accepted the \u201cchauvinistic attitude\u201d as a causal factor of traffic deaths, it couldn\u2019t account for the whole 78.4%. A much more careful analysis - based on accurate capturing - of the data is required.https://africacheck.org/reports/does-the-carnage-on-south-africas-roads-claim-more-lives-than-aids-and-tb/https://africacheck.org/reports/are-road-crashes-the-leading-of-deaths-among-s-african-children-under-five/", "lang": "en"}
