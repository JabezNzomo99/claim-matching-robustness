In the photo, what appears to be a human face sits in supermarket-style meat packaging, with a label in the corner that bears the word \u201cEAT.\u201d\n\nHowever, the photo does not depict a human face sold at a \u201ccannibal meat market.\u201d It actually comes from Thai artist and baker Kittiwat Unarrom and shows a bread sculpture he made. The picture can be found on his Facebook page among hundreds of other photos of his creations.\n\nSeveral media outlets have covered Unarrom and his realistic bread creations over the years. Unarrom began sculpting body parts out of bread in the 2000s, per CNN. The sculptures are completely edible, as toppings such as raisins and nuts create the features on each loaf, according to Vice. After the bread is baked, the loaves receive a red glaze to make them appear bloody and more life-like.\n\n\u201cI want to speak out about my religious beliefs and dough can say it all,\u201d Unarrom told CNN. \u201cBaking human parts can show the audience how transient bread, and life, is. Also, my bread is still bread no matter how it looks.\u201d (RELATED: Did Macaulay Culkin Make This Statement About Hollywood Child Abuse?)\n\nHis bread sculptures of human body parts have been displayed in art exhibitions in Thailand, CNN reported.", "lang": "en"}
