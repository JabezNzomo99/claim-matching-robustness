The picture is a composite taken in 2011 by photographer Chris Kotsiopoulos.\n\nHe took a number of pictures during a thunderstorm on the Greek island of Ikaria. On his website, he says: \u201cIn order to make the sequence, I set the camera to a tripod taking 20 second shots continuously. After 83 minutes I ended up with approximately 90 lightning shots. I had to exclude around 20 because the photo condensed so much that [it] didn't look nice.\u201d\n\nClaims that the picture was taken in Caldbeck seem to stem from one Facebook user, whose name other posts credit the picture to. That Facebook user later posted that he had used the photo as a joke.", "lang": "en"}
