(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe county\u2019s employee database has no Rittenhouse. The sheriff\u2019s department lists 10 staffers. The Rittenhouse name doesn\u2019t appear. We called the department and they don\u2019t know of any employee by that name. We checked with the City of Kenosha and the human resources department told us no Rittenhouse has worked for the city in any capacity.\n\nKyle Rittenhouse has been strongly drawn to police work. He supported the Blue Lives Matter movement on social media. He participated in a youth training program for aspiring law enforcement officers.\n\nAside from the post having zero basis in reality, Rittenhouse lives with his single mother, a nurse\u2019s assistant, in Antioch, Ill,, not Wisconsin.\n\nCourt records from 2014 show that Kyle Rittenhouse's, Michael Rittenhouse, was living in Zion, Ill., when he was ordered to pay $85 a week in child support. At the time, he worked for QPS Employment, a firm that provides temporary office workers and other staffing services.\n\nWe rate the post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
