Spokespeople from his hotels have denied that the hotels will become coronavirus hospitals.\n\nThe Juventus forward co-owns the Pestana CR7 Hotels with the Pestana Hotel Group, according to The Independent. The brand currently operates in Lisbon and Funchal, two cities in Ronaldo\u2019s home country of Portugal.

There is no mention of such hotel conversions on his verified social media accounts.\n\n\u201cThe information is inaccurate,\u201d a Pestana Hotel spokesperson told Agence France-Presse. \u201cWe did not receive any indication of this regard.\u201d\n\nThe hotel\u2019s Lisbon branch also told Dutch outlet RTL Nieuws on March 15 that they have no plans to convert into a hospital for coronavirus patients.\n\nRonaldo does not appear to have spoken much about the new coronavirus that has sickened over 254,000 people worldwide. He has only tweeted once about the virus, urging people to follow the recommendations of public health officials.\n\n\u201cIt is important we all follow the advice of the WHO (World Health Organization) and the governing bodies on how we handle this current situation,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cProtecting human life must come above any other interests.\u201d\n\nRonaldo and other Juventus players are currently self-quarantining because one of their teammates, Daniele Rugani, tested positive for the new coronavirus, according to a statement from the Italian soccer club. Some 1,020 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, have been documented in Portugal at the time of publication.\n\nThe claim appears to have originated with Spanish sportscaster Adriano Del Monte, who tweeted on March 14 that Ronaldo was converting his hotels into hospitals. He has since deleted the tweet.", "lang": "en"}
