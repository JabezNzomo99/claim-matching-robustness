{"title": "Has the gig economy doubled in size in three years?", "subtitle": "A TUC report found that the gig economy has doubled since 2016, but its claim that this means more UK workers are patching a living together is unproven.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-23881", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/has-gig-economy-doubled/", "vclaim": "Has the gig economy doubled in size in three years?\n\nIn a recent report, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) stated that the size of the \u201cgig economy\u201d in the UK has doubled since 2016 (a headline that was then picked up by the Guardian and HuffPost and was also cited by BBC News). The TUC claimed that this showed that UK workers are increasingly likely to patch together a living from multiple different sources.\n\nThe first claim is fair, based on one common measure of the gig economy. But there\u2019s not enough evidence to make the second claim.\n\nOn the claim that the gig economy has doubled, the TUC found that the number of people reporting that they did \u201cplatform work\u201d at least once a week in the UK has doubled since 2016. There is no formal definition of the gig economy, but the number of \u201cplatform workers\u201d\u2014people who find jobs via a website or app\u2014is one common measure.\n\nOn the second point, the TUC points to the fact that, for most platform workers, platform work makes up less than half of their income. It says this shows that UK workers are increasingly getting income from multiple different sources.\n\nBut there is not enough evidence to make this claim. The TUC found the number of people working through platforms had increased. It didn\u2019t look at whether or not platform workers had multiple sources of income before they took up platform work. It also didn\u2019t measure the change in the number of people with multiple income sources who don\u2019t work via platforms.\n\nWhat did the TUC find?\n\nThe TUC used analysis by the University of Hertfordshire of two Ipsos MORI polls, conducted in 2016 and 2019, finding that the proportion of adults aged 16 to 75 claiming to do platform work at least once a week more than doubled in three years, from 4.7% to 9.6%.\n\nThat works out at around 4.7 million people in 2019. As the survey data from 2019 isn\u2019t yet ready to be published, we haven\u2019t been able do check if the questions were worded in the same way in both surveys.\n\nOn the back of this finding, the TUC published the headline: \u201cUK\u2019s gig economy workforce has doubled since 2016\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to use platform work as a proxy for the \u201cgig economy\", but it\u2019s also important to clarify that the gig economy has no fixed definition.\n\nThe BBC quotes a definition of the gig economy as \"a labour market characterised by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work, as opposed to permanent jobs\". This is a broader definition\u2014effectively all short-term jobs.\n\n\u201cPlatform workers\u201d are a narrower group\u2014only including people who used an internet-enabled device to find work.\n\nPlatform work is more than Uber\n\nThe rise in the number of people doing platform work doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they have all taken up a new line of work. Some of this rise in the number of platform workers could simply be down to the fact that, as technology changes, more apps and platforms are available for workers to use.\n\nTo illustrate this, it helps to understand the type of work platform workers most typically do. While apps like Uber and Deliveroo may be among the best-known examples of such platforms, the kind of jobs platform workers do are quite varied.\n\nAmong those who do platform work at least once a week, the most common type of job is office work, short tasks or \u2018click work\u2019 done by someone on their own computer (39% of platform workers). That\u2019s followed by online work such as design, editing, software development or translation (28%), regular scheduled work in other people\u2019s homes, such as cleaning, gardening and babysitting (26%), and professional work such as legal services and accounting (26%).\n\nAll of the job categories existed before platforms. So while more people are choosing to do this via apps and platforms, the report doesn\u2019t tell us much about whether the work these people are doing day-to-day has actually changed.\n\nAs the researchers say, \u201cmany of the tasks now carried out by platform workers are not new in themselves but have been carried out in the past by casually-employed or self-employed people\u201d. They add that further research is needed to find out \u201cto what extent these survey findings represent new developments related to digitalisation and the development of online platforms\u201d.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if workers are increasingly patching together income from different sources\n\nThe TUC says: \u201c\u201cPlatform work\u201d is used to supplement other forms of income.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s correct. The TUC points out that only 9.4% of all platform workers (around 600,000 people) say platform work is their only source of income, and that 71.5% say platform work makes up less than half of their income (both of these figures exclude the 25% of respondents who don\u2019t know or wouldn\u2019t say).\n\nThe TUC goes on to say that this \u201creflect[s] that UK workers are increasingly likely to patch together a living from multiple different sources\u201d.\n\nThe word \u201cincreasingly\u201d makes one big un-evidenced assumption\u2014that new platform workers were not previously receiving income from multiple sources. The TUC\u2019s report does not include any evidence about how many sources of income platform workers had before they took up platform work.\n\nFor example, the fact that a cleaner or translator may have decided between 2016 and 2019 to source some of their work through an app does not mean that they find themselves newly trying to \u201cpatch together a living from multiple sources.\u201d\n\nThe rise in platform work could simply reflect the fact that workers who already had multiple sources of income are increasingly going online to find some of that work, as technology changes.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t know this for sure. But neither can the TUC. We don\u2019t know whether platform workers had multiple sources of income before they took up a platform. Nor do we know what kind of non-platform work they do.\n\nPlatform workers are not the only people who might have more than one income\n\nAnother issue is that platform workers are not the only people we need to consider when measuring income sources among \u201cUK workers\u201d as a whole.\n\nPut simply: you can do no platform work at all, and still have multiple sources of income. But these workers wouldn\u2019t be captured by the TUC\u2019s data because they\u2019re not platform workers.\n\nThe TUC\u2019s data covers an estimated 5 million people who do platform work weekly, but there are almost 33 million people in employment overall.\n\nElsewhere in the press release, TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady stated that the explosion in the gig economy reflected how \"huge numbers are being forced to take on casual and insecure platform work \u2013 often on top of other jobs.\u201d Wider evidence doesn\u2019t seem to support the idea that more people are taking on second jobs: as of February-April 2019, there were just over 1.1 million workers with a second job in the UK\u2014which is almost exactly the same number as three years ago.\n\nAs a percentage of all people in employment, the level of people with second jobs has fallen in recent years, to 3%.", "lang": "en"}
