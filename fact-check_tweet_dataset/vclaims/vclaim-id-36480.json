The claim is false; this is an old hoax that has circulated since at least 2016 and has been repeatedly refuted by the Icelandic government; official figures from the United Nations show men have made up more than 50% of Iceland's population over the last decade.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on February 19, 2020. It has since been shared more than 1,900 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post's Thai caption translates to English as: \"Monthly payment of 170,000 to become husbands, with a simple offer that all men want.\"\n\nALSO READ: Old Business Incentive Scheme From Southern Italy Reshared As New\n\nThe superimposed text translates to English as; \"Looking for husbands monthly pay of 170,000 due to male scarcity.\"\n\n\n\nThe same claim and images were also published in various online articles that were shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the misleading articles:\n\nThe Thai article translates to English in part as: \"It has become a story that young mens' eyes glare up, as recently Iceland has experienced a severe scarcity in their male population. Due to an imbalance of the country's population, there are many more women than men in the country.\n\n\"The government is forced to urgently tackle this problem with an idea to grant rights to men who are not Icelandic nationals (immigrants) who marry with Icelandic women to receive US$5,000 per month, or equivalent to 173,070 baht per month.\"\n\nArticles making the same claim were also published on other sites seen here, here, here and here.\n\nA spokesperson for Chamnarn Viravan, Iceland's honorary consulate general in Thailand, told AFP by phone on March 6, 2020 that the claim is untrue.\n\nThe hoax has circulated online since at least 2016. It was reported on here by Iceland Monitor, an Icelandic English-language news site, on August 30, 2016. The article notes that the Scandinavian island nation had received dozens of inquiries from foreign suitors interested in grant after the false claim was posted online.\n\nALSO READ: No, Employer Did Not Hide Work From Home Advice On COVID-19 Poster\n\nIn 2018, Iceland Monitor published another report on the enduring hoax. The article quoted a statement from the Foreign Ministry of Iceland, which states that \"any and all news items or rumours of this money-for-marriage deal are a hoax\".\n\n\n\nThe hoax has also been debunked by other fact checking organisations such as Snopes and Africa Check.\n\nIceland does not suffer from a lack of male residents.
