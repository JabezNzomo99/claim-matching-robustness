Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: In India, between 2016-2018, 84,374 rapes were committed and 81,000 rapists were muslims. Fact: National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has not yet released the 2018 data. Also, NCRB does not categorize the data on the accused or convicted based on religion. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nNational Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) releases the year-wise data of crimes that are committed in India. Recently, they released the \u2018Crime in India \u2013 2017\u2018. They haven\u2019t released the 2018 report as yet, but the post talks about the number of rapes in 2018. So, the numbers shown in the post are not true.\n\n\n\nAlso, NCRB mentions the religion of neither the victim nor the offender in the data it releases for any crimes including rapes.\n\n\n\nThe number of rapes reported in 2016 and 2017 can be seen here.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, there is no truth in the information that 84,374 rapes were reported in 2016 \u2013 2018 and 81,000 rapists were Muslims.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
