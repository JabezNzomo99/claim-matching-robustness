The statement said Lavrov considered this a case of putting forward \u201cunsubstantiated accusations\u201d that go against the \u201cnorms of international dialogue.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the suspected Austrian army colonel in question confessed to spying, according to the Austrian newspaper Die Presse. And even the Russian state media outlet Sputnik reported on his confession, citing the Die Presse article.\n\nAustria\u2019s Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl, who danced with Russian President Vladimir Putin at her wedding this past August, cancelled her upcoming visit to Moscow amid the spy scandal.\n\nSome observers see this espionage scandal as an embarrassment for Austria, which refused to join other European nations in expelling Russian diplomats following the Skripal poisonings, in which Russia\u2019s intelligence services have been implicated.", "lang": "en"}
