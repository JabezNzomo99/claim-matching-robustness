He is the richest man in Africa, with an estimated net worth of $8.3 billion as of press time, according to Forbes.\n\nThe Facebook post claims that Dangote has further pledged to provide all Nigerian citizens with weekly 20,000 naira allowances, saying, \u201cAliko Dangote is set to put a smile on every Nigerian citizens face. He wants to do what federal government failed to do!\u201d It urges users to \u201cclick to apply\u201d without providing a link.\n\nHad he done so, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on it, and the Aliko Dangote Foundation has not put out a press release. The Dangote Group also refuted the claim in an April 15 Facebook post.\n\n\u201cWe have been alerted of a scam purportedly sanctioned by Aliko Dangote Foundation and claiming to pay people a weekly allowance of N20,000,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cThis malicious act aimed at defrauding unsuspecting victims is currently being perpetuated through several channels including WhatsApp, emails, sms, and dedicated website.\u201d\n\nWhile the Nigerian government doesn\u2019t appear to have promised weekly allowances to its citizens, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari did announce on March 29 that conditional cash transfers would be paid to the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d for two months. Roughly 148,000 people received such payments between April 8 and April 14, according to the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nAs of press time, Nigeria has reported 9,800 coronavirus cases and some 270 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.", "lang": "en"}
