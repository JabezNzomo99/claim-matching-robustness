Yet Americans for Tax Reform did not provide specific data points supporting the claim that Christie has \u201cvetoed more tax increases than any other governor in modern American history.\u201d (The same claim on his campaign Web site includes the \u201cmodern American history\u201d distinction. At the debate, he just generally said \u201cAmerican history.\u201d) Christie\u2019s campaign pointed to Americans for Tax Reform as the source.\n\nIn this case, Americans for Tax Reform essentially placed the burden of proof on us. We are not going to go back through the annals of governors\u2019 tax-hike vetoes in every state to prove Americans for Tax Reform was correct or incorrect; that is the group\u2019s responsibility to do so when it dubs Christie with this title.\n\nHow did Americans for Tax Reform arrive at the conclusion that Christie has \u201cvetoed more tax hikes than any governor in American history\u201d? In part, an Internet search, the group said. \u201cLook at the number of budgets with tax hikes he has vetoed: all of them,\u201d said Paul Blair, state affairs manager for Americans for Tax Reform. \u201cThen you get the number of times Garden State Dems succeeded in screwing taxpayers with a greater tax burden: zero,\u201d Blair said. \u201cThen use Google to examine what other governor in modern history has saved their state from as much crap as Trenton Dems have demanded instead of government reform: zero.\u201d\n\nThe group said it stands by the statement it gave to the Inquirer, and offered us another statement by Blair: \u201cChris Christie has protected taxpayers from billions of dollars in higher taxes. Chris Christie and his veto pen are the only thing standing in the way of Democrats screwing families and small businesses in the Garden State.\u201d We asked for underlying data, but received no response.\n\nChristie \u201chas tried to bring some fiscal sanity to Trenton, although he scores better on taxes than spending,\u201d according to the report card. Christie, like many governors, \u201chas a weakness for handing out narrow tax breaks and subsidies to businesses,\u201d it says. But it also noted the budget problems the state may face in the future because Christie approved Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe majority of Christie\u2019s vetoes were not related to tax hikes, the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services database shows. But Christie did wield his veto power against some big-ticket tax-hike proposals that landed at his desk, according to data from Chris Edwards, Cato Institute\u2019s director of tax policy studies. One, in particular, was a 2012 veto of a tax hike on high earners, which saved those taxpayers $800 million a year. In 2011, he signed a large package of business tax cuts, valued at about $350 million a year.\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures and MultiState Associates Inc., a state and local government relations services firm based in Alexandria, Va., maintains information on party breakdowns of the governor and legislative chambers in each state. Between 2010 and 2015, the years Christie has been governor, there were between seven and 16 governors who faced legislatures controlled by the opposing party. Only a handful of other states had this set-up for the majority of those six years: Nevada, Missouri, New Mexico and Montana.\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform has dubbed Christie as the governor who has \u201cvetoed more tax increases than any other governor in modern American history.\u201d Americans for Tax Reform should do more than some Google searches to back this up, and define what \u201cmodern American history\u201d means. Christie has taken and run with this designation, often without the \u201cmodern\u201d part of \u201cmodern American history,\u201d as he did during the debate. That earns him at least One Pinocchio.\n\nWe wavered between One and Two Pinocchios, but this claim lacks context. As the Republican governor working with a Democrat-controlled legislature throughout his tenure, Christie is in a unique circumstance that only one other governor has been in over the six years (and that governor is a Democrat). Given this setup, he has more opportunities to strike down bills using his veto power. Christie successfully has fended off veto overrides, as Democrats never held a veto-proof majority since he took office. This tipped us to Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
