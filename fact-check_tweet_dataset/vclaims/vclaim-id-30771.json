But the photo has been shared in a misleading context; it shows the destruction of Thailand's Kalayanamitr Temple in 2015; the Thai government has refuted the claim it is preparing to demolish thousands of temples.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on January 14, 2020. It has since been shared more than 1,900 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Thai text superimposed over the photo translates to English as: \u201cThe government is preparing to order authorities to smash 6,000 temples in national park areas throughout the country. What should we do fellow Buddhists?\u201d\n\nThe text highlighted in pink reads: \u201cThe government of smashing temples\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cThis is like losing our independence for the third time, the second time was when we were burnt by the Burmese. The third time is under the demolition orders of an unfaithful Muslim Prime Minister.\u201d\n\nThe photo has been shared in a misleading context; a reverse image search on Google found it shows the destruction of Bangkok's Kalayanamitr Temple. It matches with screenshots from a video published here by Nation TV, a Thai news channel, on August 25, 2015.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video report:\n\nThe article\u2019s headline translates into English as: \u201cDirector of National Office of Buddhism has delayed the order to demolish Kalayanamitr Temple\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the Nation TV video (R) with similarities circled in red by AFP:\n\nThe destruction of Kalyanamitr Temple gained national media attention after a judge ordered authorities to cease the demolition.\n\nIn 2018, a court sentenced the Kalayanamitr abbot to one year parole for proceeding with temple renovations that resulted in the destruction of ancient ruins located nearby, according to this report by Thairath, a Thai daily newspaper.\n\nThailand\u2019s Anti-Fake News Centre, a government-run platform within the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society, published a report here labeling the claim in the misleading post as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Anti-Fake News Centre\u2019s article:\n\nThe Thai headline translates to English as: \u201cThe Government Prepares to Smash Temples in 6,000 parks around the country is fake news that has confused the general public. Do not share!\u201d\n\nThe office of Director Thanya Netithammakun, who heads the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, also said the claim was false.\n\n\u201cThis piece of information is false. Demolishing temples is not our agenda, nor it will ever be. We fully support the existence of temples in national park areas throughout the country,\u201d the director\u2019s spokesperson told AFP by phone on January 23, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
