When the plan was announced, around 10,000 tests were being done per day.\n\nThe wording of the target varied in government announcements, with the UK Prime Minister Twitter account saying the target was to \u201ctest 100,000 people per day\u201d.\n\nIt was then claimed that the target had been achieved on 30 April, when 122,347 tests were logged. However, only 73,191 people were tested on that day. The 122,347 includes 27,497 home tests sent out and 12,872 which were sent out to satellite testing sites.\n\nAs revealed by the Health Service Journal on 1 May and confirmed by Professor John Newton, Director of Health Improvement at Public Health England, tests are counted at the point they are sent out to people or satellite centres, not when they are completed. This means the amount of tests carried out does not equate to the amount of people who have been tested each day, or the amount of completed tests. It is likely a proportion of those sent out will not be returned or improperly taken.\n\nMatt Hancock said on the Today programme on 12 May that the government had \u201cset a goal of 100,000 tests a day\u201d and was \u201cmeeting it\u201d.\n\nThe 100,000 target has only been achieved four times, on 30 April, 1 May, 10 May and 13 May. The number of people tested in a given day reached 73,191 on April 30, and has not climbed higher since.\n\nIt is not clear what exactly the mentioned targets are supposed to refer to.\n\nOn 6 May, Boris Johnson announced that the government\u2019s ambition was to reach 200,000 tests per day by the end of May. The UK\u2019s statistical regulator wrote to Matt Hancock to request clarity on whether the government\u2019s targets are supposed to reflect testing capacity, tests that have been administered, test results received or the number of people tested.\n\nMatt Hancock\u2019s claim that the UK government is meeting its coronavirus testing targets is misleading. The goal of 100,000 or more tests per day has been achieved four times, but includes tests sent out to satellite testing stations and homes. These tests may not have been completed.\n\nFerret Fact Service (FFS) is a non-partisan fact checker, working to the International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers\u2019 code of principles.
