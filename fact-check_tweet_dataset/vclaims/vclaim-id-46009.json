Apart from SAARC countries, Japan, Australia and several other nations, also participated in the feat \u2013 the channel asserted as \u2018breaking news\u2019.\n\nPM Modi had appealed that every citizen lights a diya, candle or a torch at 9 pm on April 5 for nine minutes to \u2018dispel\u2019 the darkness caused by the coronavirus pandemic. While his request was met with resounding support within the country (with many partaking in mini-Diwali celebrations), News18 India declared that the activity was a global success.\n\nNews18 India\u2019s claim that countries across the world joined India in switching off lights and lighting candles is a gross misinterpretation of the actual news. Zee Media \u2013 Zee Newsand WION \u2013 had reported that they had reached out to foreign missions of SAARC countries and non-South Asian regions as well, who expressed solidarity for PM Modi\u2019s appeal. A foreign mission is a diplomat who represents the interests of a country abroad.\n\nForeign missions of namely Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Vietnam, Japan, Australia, Israel, German, Tunisia and Mexico told Zee Media that they would participate in the activity. \u201cSeveral foreign missions have come out in support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s call of solidarity by switching off lights and lighting up diyas, candles and torches at 9 pm on Sunday night at mission offices and residences of diplomats,\u201d reported Zee News.\n\nBelow is a tweet by Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong.\n\nNepal\u2019s envoy Nilamber Acharya told WION, \u201cWe, Nepal and India, are all in full solidarity in this fight against COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Afghan Envoy Tahir Qadiry also confirmed his participation to Zee News: \u201cI will be switching off lights and lighting a candle at 9 pm tonight for 9 minutes to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s call to showcase our solidarity and our concerted efforts in a battle against the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nCNN News18, which is the English sister channel of News18 India, also claimed that SAARC countries, barring Pakistan, and other friendly countries like Israel and Japan participated in the effort led by PM Modi. Ironically, while the broadcast was a misreport, the tweet put out by the channel rightly mentioned \u201cmany other missions\u201d.\n\nTo reiterate, nations across the world did not join India in the switching off lights and igniting candles on April 5 but foreign mission took part in the activity. This means that diplomats and ambassadors of different countries to India participated at mission offices and residences as a friendly gesture to show solidarity with India.\n\nDuring its 4 pm bulletin on April 6, New18 India carried a clarification stating that the channel erroneously referred to embassies as countries. The relevant section of the broadcast can be watched below.\n\n[This report was updated on April 13, 2020 with News18\u2019s clarification.]", "lang": "en"}
