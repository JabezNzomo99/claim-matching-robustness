The Congress drew a blank.\n\nThe viral message states that apart from the 8 seats won, the BJP lost:\n\u2022 8 seats with a margin of fewer than 100 votes.\n\u2022 19 seats with a margin less than 1000 votes.\n\u2022 9 seats with a margin less than 2000 votes.\n\nIt goes on to add that they lost by a close margin and could have potentially won 44 seats (8+19+9+8=44), well past the majority mark.\n\nSocial media was abuzz with this false analysis of the election results.\n\nBJP lost 36 seats with a margin of fewer than 2,000 votes in Delhi\n\nOfficial data released by Election Commission of India shows only 2 seats with such low margins of defeat for the BJP.\n\nThe message called for a dig into the Election Commission of India data.\n\nAccording to the data published on their website, there are no seats below the 100 vote margin threshold, 2 seats ( Laxmi Nagar, Bijwasan ) below the 1000-vote margin threshold and just 1 seat (Adarsh Nagar) below 2000-vote margin threshold.\n\nErgo, it is evident that only 3 seats had a margin less than 2000.\n\n\n\nIn Bijwasan, Bhupinder Singh Joon of AAP earned 57,271 votes defeating BJP's Sat Prakash Rana who had earned 56,518 votes - by a margin of 753 votes. This is the smallest margin of this election.\n\nIn Laxmi Nagar, Abhay Verma of BJP earned 65,735 votes defeating AAP's Nitin Tyagi who had earned 64,855 votes. The vote margin was 880 votes.\n\nContrary to claims, only two and not 36 BJP candidates witnessed such neck-and-neck competition.\n\nTherefore, It can be confirmed that the claim made in the viral posts is false.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Elections Over, Its Time For Aam Aadmi Party To Walk The Talk", "lang": "en"}
