What do you say to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths within this country. We should be profiling, monitoring and creating policies to fight the radicalization of white men.\u201d\n\nIn June, we launched the Fact Checker\u2019s guide to manipulated video, part of an effort to create a universal language to label manipulated video and hold creators and sharers of this misinformation accountable. The clipped video is an example of \u201cDeceptive Editing \u2014 Omission,\u201d when a portion of the video is snipped to leave a misimpression.\n\nJeremy Slevin, Omar\u2019s spokesman, said she was referring to an annual report issued by the Anti-Defamation League. The 2019 report says right-wing extremists were linked to at least 50 extremist-related killings in the United States in 2018. That\u2019s more such deaths than in any year since 1995.\n\nThe report said that between 2009 and 2018, there were 12 lethal domestic incidents involving Islamist extremists. They resulted in 100 deaths, with almost half of those deaths \u2014 49 \u2014 occurring in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. The 100 deaths amount to almost one-quarter of the 427 deaths attributed to extremists in that 10-year period.\n\nIn a 2017 report with a somewhat wider time frame \u2014 Sept. 12, 2001, to Dec. 31, 2016 \u2014 the Government Accountability Office found there have been 85 attacks in the country by extremists, resulting in 225 deaths. (GAO used data from the U.S. Extremist Crime Database.) That report found slightly more people killed by Islamist extremists than far-right extremists, but only because 41 percent of the deaths stemmed from the Orlando shooting rampage. Almost three times as many attacks were carried out by far-right extremists in that period.\n\nNow, Omar could certainly be faulted for using sloppy language. She never actually refers to white supremacists or white nationalism in her answer, which is one reason it was so easily manipulated.\n\nMoreover, given that the United States is almost 75 percent white, it stands to reason that a similar percentage of mass shootings and/or terrorist incidents would be committed by whites. It would be a mistake to suggest that whites are overrepresented \u2014 although virtually all such killers are men.\n\n\"These questions prove my point. If a Republican grouped all men, of any background or ethnicity, together in any negative context -- especially terrorism -- many in the media would immediately demand that other Republicans disavow their statement. But when Rep. Omar suggested white men -- \u202anot white supremacists or white nationalists, white men -- pose a greater danger than jihadists, many in the \u202amedia rushed to her defense and attacked me for pointing out this double standard.\u201d\n\nWithin context, Omar makes a valid \u2014 if somewhat confusingly phrased \u2014 point. But her words were twisted in the tweet and video. Rubio had no business retweeting it without understanding the full context of the interview. All viewers should check the facts before retweeting or jumping to conclusions about a video circulated on social media. Rather than an example of racism, this should serve as a cautionary tale for the Republican senator from Florida. He earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
