It doesn\u2019t appear in the Shakespeare Quartos Archive, an online database of all his plays, or a complete collection of his poems.\n\nFurthermore, scholars told the Daily Caller News Foundation that they do not recognize the expression. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it\u2019s from, but it is not Shakespearean,\u201d said Paul Budra, author of \u201cShakespeare Early and Late: A Textbook,\u201d in an email to the DCNF.\n\nVersions of the phrase have also been attributed to the likes of Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain and Winston Churchill.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
