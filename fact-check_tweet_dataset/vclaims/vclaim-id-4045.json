Part of Wolf\u2019s remarks were interpreted as a jab at Sanders\u2019 appearance; she indirectly referred to her as a softball coach dividing the press corps into teams, and that Sanders \"burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye.\" Trump, as well as some members of the press association, criticized Wolf\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe Daily World Update wrote that Marvin Schmidt, a supposed former CNN co-host, was fired after he defended Wolf\u2019s remarks.\n\n\"Look at that face,\" Schmidt said in an alleged now-deleted tweet, The Daily World Update wrote. \"I mean, she\u2019s a woman and I\u2019m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on! Are we serious?\"\n\nThat quote was actually made by Trump in a Rolling Stone interview in 2015 when speaking about GOP presidential contender Carly Fiorina.\n\n\"Look at that face!\" he cries. \"Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!\" The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. \"I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not s'posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?\"\n\nCNN has no co-host named Marvin Schmidt, a CNN spokeswoman Barbara Levin told PolitiFact. She said the story was fabricated.\n\nThe Daily World Update story includes a photo of three people on CNN, including a black man in the middle with a red circle drawn around his face suggesting that he was the alleged Schmidt who was fired. We searched for the photo in Google Images and found that it matched a panel of guests on CNN in February 2016 about the reaction to Beyonce\u2019s album Formation. The black man on the panel was Bakari Sellers, a CNN commentator and a former South Carolina state representative. Sellers told PolitiFact that he hasn\u2019t spoken on CNN about Wolf\u2019s speech to the White House Correspondents Association.\n\nThe Daily World Update describes itself as satire. But this story hardly meets that definition. The website is linked to a frequent purveyor of such hoaxes, Christopher Blair, who says he creates fake stories to make money. The post Facebook users see would give little clue to the fact that the story is made up.\n\nThe Daily World Update wrote that \"CNN shocks America, fires \u2018journalist\u2019 who made fun of Sarah Sanders\u2019 face.\" The story said that Marvin Schmidt was fired by CNN, but there is no co-host at CNN by that name. The story said Schmidt tweeted an insult about Sanders\u2019 appearance, but the actual quote came from Trump in 2015 about Carly Fiorina.\n\nWe rate this headline Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
