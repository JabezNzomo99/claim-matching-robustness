John Philpot Curran, an Irish politician, may actually have originated the saying.\n\nJefferson made many highly quotable statements, but the saying attributed to him the Facebook post doesn\u2019t appear to be one of them. It appears nowhere in his written works.

In the 1790 address, Curran said, \u201cThe condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime and the punishment of his guilt.\u201d\n\nThe quote first appeared in print in 1817 but wasn\u2019t attributed to Jefferson until at least 1834, according to his estate at Monticello.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
