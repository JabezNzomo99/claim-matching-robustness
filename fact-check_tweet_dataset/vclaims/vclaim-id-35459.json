Rand Paul, R-Ky., drew a backlash from the audience of ABC\u2019s \"The View\" when he argued that lower-income Americans get off pretty easy under the U.S. tax system.\n\nRicher Americans, he said, carry most of the freight.\n\n\"We\u2019ve taken the poor off of the rolls. They don\u2019t pay income tax any more. Most people below $50,000 don\u2019t pay any income tax,\" Paul said during the Oct. 11 episode. \"The top 1 percent in our country pay 40%.\"\n\nAt that point, the audience began to object, and cohost Sunny Hostin told Paul, \"Our audience says that\u2019s not true.\"\n\nBut Paul doubled down. \"The IRS statistics say the top 1% in our country pay 40% of the income tax,\" he said.\n\nWe looked into it and found the senator was largely correct.\n\nWhen we reached out to Paul\u2019s office, they said he was referring to the most recent projections for 2019 by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the official arbiter of tax analysis for Congress.\n\nFor the federal income tax, the committee found that every income group below $50,000 paid a negative average share of the income burden. That means that, on the whole, families in these income groups got deductions and credits that reduced their federal income tax liability below zero.\n\nMeanwhile, the same analysis provided a snapshot of the tax burden shouldered by the top 1.2 percent of tax filers, those earning at least $500,000. This elite group collectively footed 51.5% of the nation\u2019s individual income tax bill. That\u2019s a larger share than what Paul said.\n\nSo if you look at the federal income tax, Paul\u2019s comment on the view is on target.\n\nWhat about other taxes?\n\nIndividual taxes aren\u2019t the only ones Americans pay.\n\nIf you factor in other federal taxes, including payroll and excise taxes, the numbers change.\n\nThe same Joint Committee on Taxation analysis found that those earning less than $50,000 paid 4.3% of all federal taxes. That\u2019s still a relatively light burden, since these taxpayers earned 13% of all income generated.\n\nAs for Americans earning more than $500,000, their share of the tax burden declines to 30.7% once you add in these other federal taxes.\n\nOther analyses back him up\n\nA few other analyses are broadly in line with the joint committee\u2019s data and what Paul said.\n\nAn annual analysis by the IRS found that in 2017, the top 1% paid 38.5% of federal income taxes. And taxpayers earning under $50,000 paid 5.98 percent of income taxes. (Not nothing, as Paul said, but not nearly as much.)\n\nMeanwhile, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated the breakdown for all federal taxes in 2019.\n\nThe center found that those earning up to about $50,000 in income collectively paid about 4.2% of all federal taxes, while the top 1% paid about 27 percent of all federal taxes.\n\nThese are averages, and individual tax burdens can vary.\n\n\"The results depend on the specific situations faced by taxpayers, such as whether or not they have children,\" said Mark Mazur, the Tax Policy Center\u2019s director.\n\nPaul said that \"most people below $50,000 don\u2019t pay any income tax. The top 1 percent in our country pay 40%.\"\n\nBecause he limited his comments to the federal income tax, Paul\u2019s numbers are broadly accurate, and they even underplay the tax burden on the top 1%.\n\nThe picture shifts once you include other types of federal taxation. Those below $50,000 still pay a small share of the full federal tax burden, but the share paid by the top 1% falls to about 30%.\n\nSo Paul\u2019s statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate the statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
