Then why is the property tax levy millions of dollars higher than when Abele took office?\n\nIt\u2019s been well documented that the county Board of Supervisors has generally raised property taxes in making changes to Abele\u2019s budgets.\n\nBut Abele has, in his own way, adopted those increases as well.\n\nAbele has proposed five county budgets since winning a special election in April 2011 to finish out the final year of Scott Walker\u2019s term, after Walker was elected governor. Abele won a full four-year term in 2012, running unopposed. But he faces a serious challenge from state Sen. Chris Larson of Milwaukee in the April 2016 election.\n\nAs the following table shows, for each of his five budgets, Abele proposed a property tax levy freeze -- in other words, he proposed levying the same total amount of property taxes that was levied the previous year.\n\nBut it\u2019s also clear that Abele\u2019s proposed levy has increased every year, and was $13 million higher in 2016 than it was in 2012.\n\n*The County Board on Nov. 9, 2015, adopted the 2016 budget, though Abele can still issue vetoes.\n\nThe pattern was essentially the same each year:\n\u2022 Abele proposed a budget that would have frozen the levy.\n\u2022 The County Board approved changes in the budget that -- except for 2014, when the levy stayed the same -- raised the levy.\n\u2022 Abele issued a number of budget vetoes, some or all of which were overridden by the County Board.\n\u2022 The result was that, except for 2014, the County Board ultimately adopted a budget that contained a property tax levy larger than what Abele proposed.\n\nSo, by proposing the freezes, and issuing the vetoes, each year, Abele tried to keep the property levy from going up.\n\nBut when it came time to propose a budget for the next year, Abele used the previous year\u2019s levy.\n\nIn other words, each year, Abele took advantage of the fact that the County Board had adopted a levy that was higher than he proposed.\n\nSo, the \"freeze\" he proposed each year was on the higher amount adopted by the board, not the lower amount that he had proposed and tried to preserve with his vetoes.\n\nThis was the same pattern Walker followed as county executive.\n\nAbele says he balanced the Milwaukee County budget \"without raising taxes five years in a row.\"\n\nThat claim has the ring of finality to it, as though Abele has presided over five budgets without a tax increase.\n\nIn reality, Abele did propose a freeze in the property tax levy each year and he issued budget vetoes that would have kept the levy down. But the County Board ultimately adopted a budget that raised the total property tax take in four of the five years, and Abele took advantage of those actions when he proposed a freeze the following year. So, taxpayers are paying more than when he took office.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.\n\nEdward Flynn: In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft \"get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court\" on holding suspects, \"a stolen car gets zero points.\" Mostly False,\n\nFacebook posts: Milwaukee \"incarcerates 1.2% of white men\" and has \"incarcerated over 50% of black men in their 30s.\" Half True.", "lang": "en"}
