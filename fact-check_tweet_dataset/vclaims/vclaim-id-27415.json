John Ratcliffe asked witnesses William Taylor, the charge d\u2019affaires ad interim at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs in the State Department, if either were there to \u201cassert there was an impeachable offense in that call.\u201d Taylor paused and then attempted to respond. Ratcliffe cut him off, then withdrew the question. But Taylor got an opportunity to respond anyway, saying that neither he nor Kent was there \u201cto decide about impeachment. \u2026 This is your job.\u201d\n\nThough Trump asserted on the day of the impeachment hearing that he hadn\u2019t watched \u201cone minute\u201d of it, the following morning on Twitter the president drew attention to the exchange Ratcliffe had with the two witnesses that occurred nearly four hours into the hearing.\n\nTrump claimed Ratcliffe\u2019s question about whether there was an impeachable event in the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stumped Taylor and Kent. Trump then commented, \u201cThat would be the end of a case run by normal people! \u2013 but not Shifty!\u201d (\u201cShifty\u201d is the president\u2019s derogatory nickname for Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, who is running the hearings.)\n\n\n\nBut as we said, Trump is mischaracterizing the exchange.\n\nIt began when Ratcliffe asked, \u201cIn this impeachment hearing today, where we impeach presidents for treason or bribery or other high crimes, where is the impeachable offense in that call? Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call? Shout it out. Anyone?\u201d\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s account that Taylor and Kent \u201cstared straight ahead with a blank look on their face, remained silent, & were unable to answer the question,\u201d Taylor briefly paused and then did attempt to answer Ratcliffe\u2019s question.\n\nTaylor began, \u201cMr. Ratcliffe, if I could just respond. Let me just reiterate that I\u2019m not here \u2026\u201d But then Ratcliffe cut him off. \u201cI\u2019ve got one minute left,\u201d Ratcliffe said.\n\nAccording to rules of the House of Representatives, members of Congress are limited to \u201cthe five-minute rule during the questioning of witnesses in a hearing until such time as each member of the committee who so desires has had an opportunity to question each witness.\u201d Ratcliffe was concerned his remaining time would be eaten up by Taylor\u2019s answer.\n\nRatcliffe and Taylor then talked over each other for a brief time, until Ratcliffe said, \u201cI withdraw the question.\u201d\n\nBut Taylor kept talking anyway. \u201cI\u2019m not here to take one side or the other,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s your decision.\u201d\n\nAfter more back and forth of the two talking over each other, Ratcliffe asked for his five-minute clock to be suspended, because he withdrew the question. Schiff allowed the suspension, and Taylor was permitted to answer without it counting against Ratcliffe\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cMr. Ratcliffe, I would just like to say that I\u2019m not here to do anything having to do with, to decide about impeachment,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat is not what either of us [he and Kent] are here to do. This is your job.\u201d\n\nThat response is consistent with comments Taylor made at the start of his testimony.\n\nTaylor, Nov. 13: I want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings. My sole purpose is to provide facts as I know them about the incidents in question, as well as my views about the strategic importance of Ukraine to the United States.\n\nYou can watch the full exchange via C-SPAN below.\n\nRepublican Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, also tweeted the first part of the exchange, commenting \u201c*crickets*\u201d to suggest the two witnesses had no response to Ratcliffe\u2019s question. The video attached to the tweet captures the pause but conveniently cuts off just as Taylor is about to respond.\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s claim, the witnesses did not remain silent when asked whether an impeachable offense occurred. Taylor did respond, and his answer did not vindicate the president.\n\nWe should also note, as we have before, there is more to the impeachment inquiry than just the July 25 phone call.\n\nGovernment officials who have testified in the House impeachment probe have discussed a campaign to pressure Zelensky to make a public statement that he would open an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had served. Taylor and others have testified that the pressure included the withholding of U.S. security aid, and the dangling of a White House visit for Zelensky.", "lang": "en"}
