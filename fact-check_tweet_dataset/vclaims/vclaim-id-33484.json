No, that's not true: the claim came from a meme on a liberal satire page on Facebook that makes up false stories and then tricks conservatives and Trump supporters into sharing them so fans of the page can laugh at them. The claim is false, it did not happen.\n\nThe story originated from a meme post published on October 16, 2018 by a Facebook page named \"America's Last Line Of Defense \" (archived here) with following caption above the image:\n\nThe text in the image read:\n\nPresident Trump was just rated the most trustworthy of all world leaders!!! Share if your proud of President Trump!\n\nHowever there is no publication named \"The Moscow Daily Press\", it is an obvious jab at Trump's alleged Russia connections.\n\nThe Facebook page spreading the hoax has an \"About\" tab that reads:\n\nAbout\n\nNothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. You have been warned. Impressum\n\nUse the force and the truth shall reveal itself. Just not here. Ever.
