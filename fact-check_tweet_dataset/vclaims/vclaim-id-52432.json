Beijing has remained mum on the number of casualties it has suffered.\n\nEscalating tension between the two countries at the Line of Actual Control has also triggered a wave of misinformation online, around the skirmish.\n\nAlso read 20 Indian Soldiers Killed In India-China Clash In Galwan Valley\n\nAlso read Names Of 56 Former PLA Generals Viral As Slain Chinese Soldiers\n\nThe 12-second-long viral clip shows Modi speaking from a dais. Speaking in Hindi, the PM says, 'Look friends, a soldier in the army goes to the battlefield to die. Because he receives a salary'.\n\nThe post, shared with a Hindi caption 'A soldier goes to the battlefield to die because he is paid a salary for that...Narendra Modi', can be viewed below.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on one of the screenshots of the viral clip and found a longer version uploaded on YouTube on March 15, 2017 under the headline 'Modi speech related to tiranga yatra'.\n\nThis 6.09 minute long video opens with the same statement by Modi that has been used in the viral clip. However, the following statement brings in more context into the incomplete statement that has been shared on social media\n\nIn his opening lines, the PM, speaking in Hindi, says 'Look friends, a soldier in the army goes to the battlefield to die. Why, because he is paid? He doesn't go to die in the battlefield because he is paid for it...he is ready to die because he loves his motherland. If you love something in your life, here I'd like to give you an example...'.\n\nHereafter, Modi goes on speaking about the Tiranga Yatra that had participated in 1992 wherein he reportedly hoisted the tricolour at Lal Chowk in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir\n\nBOOM found another clipping of the same speech that was uploaded on Twitter in 2012.\n\nWhile the video does not include the part which is now viral on social media, it has been clipped from the same video. The other clipping that was uploaded on YouTube in 2012 suggests that the video is from a time before Modi became the prime minister.\n\nBOOM could not independently verify the occasion and timeline of the event where the speech was delivered.\n\nThe PM on June 19, 2020 addressed an all-party meet where he spoke about the India-China dispute. \"Neither have they intruded into our border, nor has any post been taken over by them (China). Twenty of our jawans were martyred, but those who dared Bharat Mata, they were taught a lesson,\" the PM said, reported Hindustan Times.", "lang": "en"}
