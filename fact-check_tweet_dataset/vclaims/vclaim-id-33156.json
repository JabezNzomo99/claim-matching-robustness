None of that is true, and the Vatican denied the claims.\n\nNow, one blog is pushing an altered version of the account, quoting an Italian newspaper as saying that the 83-year-old Catholic leader first tested negative for the virus before a second test came back positive.\n\nThe story features recent photos of Pope Francis coughing and blowing his nose and claims:\n\n\"Pope Francis has tested positive for coronavirus after he fell ill in Italy and was forced to cancel a religious retreat near Rome \u2026 The first results for Covid-19 came back negative, and second came positive, according to Italian newspaper Il Messaggero this morning.\"\n\nThis account is also false.\n\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nPope Francis recently canceled some engagements and a Lent retreat after he was seen coughing and sneezing during an Ash Wednesday mass in Rome, fueling false rumors that he has the coronavirus.\n\nOn March 3, Il Messaggero reported that the pope had been tested for the virus as a precaution and that the result was negative \u2013\u2013 something the Vatican has not officially confirmed \u2013\u2013 but the story doesn\u2019t say a second test was administered or that the pope tested positive.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni didn\u2019t confirm or deny the Messaggero report, according to the Associated Press, but repeated that the pope had been diagnosed with a cold and that it was \"running its course, without symptoms linked to other pathologies.\" Bruni told Reuters he had no comment on the report.\n\nThe pope may have tested negative for the virus, but there is no evidence that he was tested more than once, or that a second result came back positive.", "lang": "en"}
