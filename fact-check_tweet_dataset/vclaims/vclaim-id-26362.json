These can also include dwellings funded or managed by government.\n\nAccording to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in 2017-18 more than 800,000 Australians lived in social housing, in more than 400,000 dwellings across the country.\n\nThe majority \u2014 72 per cent \u2014 lived in government owned and managed public housing, while 20 per cent lived in community housing, 4 per cent in Indigenous community housing and 3 per cent in state owned and managed Indigenous housing. (Total equals 99 per cent due to rounding).\n\nSocial housing levels can be measured in a number of ways. A couple of definitions you'll need to know:\n\u2022 A social housing \"household\" can be a single person, or a group of two or more people who usually reside in the same dwelling and share the cost of food and other living essentials.\n\u2022 A \"dwelling\" is the structure, or space within a structure, where the person or group of people live \u2014 whether a house, unit or apartment, caravan or tent.\n\nFact Check examined figures from a range of official sources, focusing on social housing households and dwellings measured as a proportion of total households and occupied private dwellings in Australia, rather than raw numbers, to account for population growth.\n\nThe Commonwealth Government first granted funding to the states for the provision of housing in 1945.\n\nHowever, census counts of government tenancies were first published in the 1954 census, so Fact Check has taken that as the starting point for assessing the high and low elements of the claim.\n\nThe AIHW (a federal government agency) publishes social housing statistics drawn from administrative data provided by state and territory governments.\n\nThe data includes public and community housing, as well as Indigenous community housing and state owned and managed Indigenous housing.\n\nThe latest publicly available AIHW data shows that in 2017-18, there were 4.6 social housing dwellings for every 100 households in Australia.\n\nThis was a drop from 5.1 per cent in 2007-08 (the earliest publicly available data in this series).\n\nWhile the AIHW data can't be used to assess the \"high in 1991\" aspect of the claim, it does show that social housing has fallen into the range of 4 per cent.\n\nTo look further back, Fact Check referred to Australian Bureau of Statistics census data from 1954, the first census to count tenants living in governmental housing, to 2016.\n\nChanges to the scope of information collected, differences in the definitions used and presentation of the data over the decades, as well as the self-reported nature of the survey, mean it's not a perfect measure for this purpose.\n\nHowever, the data that is available does support the assertion that 1991 was a high point, and recent years a low point, for social housing levels in Australia.\n\nIn the Survey of Income and Housing, the ABS also publishes data on the proportion of households renting from state and territory housing authorities, from a selection of 15 years between 1994\u201395 and 2017\u201318.\n\nThis data excludes public housing households in very remote areas, and doesn't include community housing, so it is not representative of all social housing.\n\nWhat the remaining data does show is a fall in the proportion of households renting from state and territory authorities, from a high of 6 per cent in 1995-96 to a low of 3.1 per cent in 2017-18.\n\nIn response to Fact Check's request for sources to support his claim, Mr Pisarski provided a 2017 research brief published by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI), a national research network.\n\nThe figures, as quoted by Mr Pisarski, show public housing alone accounting for 7.1 per cent of all households in Australia in 1991, falling to 4.2 per cent (including both public and community housing) in 2016.\n\n\n\nThe AHURI data refers only to public and community housing, omitting Indigenous community housing and state owned and managed Indigenous community housing, which according to the AIHW accounted for around 7 per cent of social housing in 2017-18.\n\nThe AHURI data is also based on census data, which is based on self-reported answers from householders, as opposed to AIHW and Productivity Commission data, which is drawn from government administrative data.\n\nThe figure of 7.1 per cent was higher than the census data (at 5.6 per cent), and experts told Fact Check it was higher than their own estimates.\n\nIt is fair to say that based on the datasets presented above, there has been a continuing downward trend in social housing levels since 1991.\n\n\n\nJudith Yates, an honorary associate in the School of Economics at the University of Sydney, told Fact Check the figures may continue to fall.\n\n\"On the basis of current household projections, it is quite possible that the estimate of 4.2 per cent will not be the lowest point reached unless there is a dramatic reversal in the current trend of net new additions to the social housing stock,\" Dr Yates said.\n\nCarmela Chivers, an associate at the Grattan Institute, told Fact Check the stock of social housing has \"barely grown in 20 years, while Australia's population has increased by 33 per cent\".\n\n\n\nTerry Burke, Professor of Housing Studies at Swinburne University Centre for Urban Transitions, told Fact Check the \"rate of investment in social housing \u2014 as either public or community housing \u2014 hasn't kept pace with the overall growth of population or of the total dwelling stock\".\n\nThe transfer of public housing to community housing\n\nThe decline has been particularly prominent for public housing \u2014 accommodation owned and managed by state and territory governments \u2014 over the last decade.\n\nIn addition to a proportional decrease, Productivity Commission data shows there has been a decrease in the raw number of public housing dwellings, from around 362,000 in 1996-97 to 316,000 in 2017-18.\n\nPart of this decline has been offset by an increase in community housing, with the number of dwellings in that sector rising from around 15,000 in 1996-97 to around 88,000 in 2017-18.\n\nThis partly reflects the transfer of some public housing stock to the community housing sector, in line with changes in government policy, as well as new growth in community housing stock.\n\nProfessor Burke of Swinburne University told Fact Check that \"community housing is now seen as the future of the social housing sector, and as such the growth sector\".\n\n\"This means community housing agencies have a higher income stream from rent than public housing.\"\n\nSupply not keeping up with demand\n\nAs of 30 June 2018, there were more than 140,000 applicants on the waiting list for public housing, and close to 9,000 applicants on the waiting list for state owned and managed Indigenous dwellings.\n\nIn June 2017, there were more than 38,000 applicants on the waiting list for mainstream community housing. Recent figures for Indigenous community housing were unavailable.\n\nPeople may be on more than one waitlist, so these numbers may be an overestimate of the total.\n\nHowever, the figures still suggest high numbers of Australians in need of social housing, with around 50,000 people (based on 2017 and 2018 figures) considered in \"greatest need\" \u2014 including people who are already homeless, at imminent risk of homelessness, or whose life or safety is at risk in their current accommodation.\n\u2022 Luke Henriques-Gomes, The Guardian, Community housing minister Luke Howarth wants a 'positive spin' on homelessness, 9 July, 2019\n\u2022 Cathy Van Extel, RN Breakfast, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Homelessness in focus as Government urged to build more social housing, 10 July, 2019\n\u2022 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Housing assistance in Australia 2018, 28 June, 2018\n\u2022 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Housing assistance in Australia 2019\n\u2022 Greg McIntosh and Janet Phillips, Parliament of Australia, The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, E-Brief: issued 29 November 2001\n\u2022 Australian Bureau of Statistics, Survey of Income and Housing, 4130.0 Housing Occupancy and Costs, Australia, 1994\u201395 to 2017\u201318\n\u2022 Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, AHURI Brief, Census data shows falling proportion of households in social housing, 16 August, 2017\n\u2022 Lucy Groenhart, Terry Burke and Liss Ralston, Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, Thirty years of public housing supply and consumption: 1981\u20132011, October 2014\n\u2022 2016 Census Community Profiles, Occupied private dwellings by 'Tenure and Landlord Type' including 'State or territory housing authority' and 'Housing co-operative/community/church group', Time Series Profile, Table 18\n\u2022 2006 Census Community Profiles, Occupied private dwellings by 'Tenure and Landlord Type' including 'State or territory housing authority' and 'Housing co-operative/community/church group', 2006 Time Series Profile, Table 16\n\u2022 Census of Population and Housing, 1991, Occupied private dwellings by 'Tenure and Landlord Type' including 'State/Territory housing authority', 2001 Time Series Profile, Table 19\n\u2022 Census of Population and Housing, 1986, Households by 'Nature of Occupancy' including 'Housing authority', Population and Dwelling Summary, Table C38\n\u2022 Census of Population and Housing, 1981, Households by 'Nature of Occupancy' including 'Tenant - Housing authority', Population and Dwelling Summary, Table 32\n\u2022 Census of Population and Housing, 1976, Private dwellings by 'Nature of Occupancy' including 'Housing Commission', Population and Dwelling Summary, Table 54\n\u2022 Census of Population and Housing, 1971, Private dwellings by 'Nature of Occupancy' including 'Tenant of Government', Bulletin 2, Part 9, Table 5\n\u2022 Census of Population and Housing, 1966, Occupied private dwellings by 'Nature of Occupancy' including 'Tenant of Government Authority', Volume 3 - Housing, Table 14\n\u2022 Census of the Commonwealth of Australia, 1961, Occupied private dwellings by 'Nature of Occupancy' including 'Tenant (Governmental Housing)', Summary of Dwellings, Table 6\n\u2022 Census of the Commonwealth of Australia, 1954, Occupied private dwellings by 'Nature of Occupancy' including 'Tenant (Governmental Housing)', Characteristics of Dwellings, Table 15\n\u2022 Matthew Thomas, Parliamentary Library, Parliament of Australia, Social housing and homelessness, May 2017", "lang": "en"}
