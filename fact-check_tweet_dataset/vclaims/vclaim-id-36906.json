(RELATED: Did George Washington Say This Quote About A \u2018Government\u2019s Right To Govern\u2019)\n\nThis image supposedly quotes four founders, each making a remark that is critical of democracy. We looked into the sayings, finding that while two can be ascribed to Adams and Hamilton, the quotes attributed to Jefferson and Franklin are spurious.\n\nThe saying ascribed to Adams comes from a letter he wrote in 1814.\n\n\u201cRemember Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes exhausts and murders itself. There never was a Democracy Yet, that did not commit suicide,\u201d he wrote, before continuing, \u201cIt is in vain to Say that Democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious or less avaricious than Aristocracy or Monarchy. It is not true in Fact and no where appears in history. Those Passions are the same in all Men under all forms of Simple Government, and when unchecked, produce the same Effects of Fraud Violence and Cruelty.\u201d\n\nThe quote attributed to Hamilton comes from remarks he\u2019s recorded as making during the Constitutional Convention of 1787.\n\n\u201cWe are now forming a republican government,\u201d Hamilton said, according to one individual reporting on the event. \u201cReal liberty is neither found in despotism or the extremes of democracy, but in moderate governments.\u201d The meme does not include that final clause, and another attendee who transcribed the same speech did not include the quote in his notes.\n\nThe quotes from Jefferson and Franklin cannot be traced back to a particular speech or letter, or any written work for that matter.\n\nJefferson\u2019s estate at Monticello lists the quotation \u2013 that \u201cdemocracy is nothing more than mob rule, where fifty-one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty-nine\u201d \u2013 on its list of \u201cspurious quotations,\u201d saying it has \u201cno evidence to confirm that Thomas Jefferson ever said or wrote\u201d this. The quote did not appear in a search of Jefferson\u2019s collected works.\n\nThe quote ascribed to Franklin says, \u201cDemocracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote.\u201d However, The Daily Caller found no instance of it in Franklin\u2019s writings, nor does the statement appear in the National Archives\u2018 online database.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t readily find the quote in Franklin\u2019s papers,\u201d Thomas Kidd, a history professor at Baylor University, told the Caller in an email.\n\nAccording to etymologist Barry Popik, the first half of the expression can be found in print as far back as 1987.\n\nThe closest Franklin comes to expressing this sentiment is where he writes in a 1773 letter, \u201cThere is Truth in the Old Saying, That if you make yourself a Sheep, the Wolves will eat you.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
