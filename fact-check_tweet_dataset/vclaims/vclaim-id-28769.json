But it is far short of the \u201cmore than one million people\u201d that Trump claimed. The last time the U.S. topped 1 million apprehensions was in fiscal year 2006, when 1,071,972 people were captured crossing the border illegally.\n\nAs for the 2019 calendar year, there have been 114,436 apprehensions in the first two months of this year. That\u2019s an average of 57,218 per month, or 686,616 a year.\n\nThere was a significant increase in apprehensions last month, when 66,450 people were caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. That was the highest single month since March 2009, when 67,342 people were captured. (There were a total of 540,865 apprehensions in fiscal year 2009.)\n\nEven if apprehensions remained at that higher level for the last seven months of the fiscal year, there would still be far fewer than 1 million border apprehensions in fiscal 2019.\n\nWe asked the White House how the president arrived at his 1 million figure, but we didn\u2019t get a response.\n\nHowever, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen M. Nielsen said at a March 6 congressional hearing that CBP saw its \u201cagents apprehending or encountering nearly 75,000 aliens\u201d in February.\n\nNotice that Nielsen used the word \u201cencountering.\u201d That\u2019s because her number includes apprehensions and so-called \u201cinadmissibles,\u201d which are \u201cindividuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible,\u201d as CBP explains on its website. In other words, Nielsen is counting those trying to enter the U.S. legally and illegally. There were 66,450 apprehensions and 9,653 inadmissibles in February for a total of 76,103 \u201cencounters,\u201d as Nielsen called them.\n\nAt the hearing, Nielsen went on to say that \u201cCBP is forecasting the problem will get even worse this spring, as the weather warms up,\u201d and \u201cat the current pace, we are on track to encounter close to 1 million illegal aliens at our southern border this year.\u201d\n\nWhen Nielsen said \u201cthis year,\u201d she was referring to calendar year 2019, not the fiscal year, a department spokesperson told us. The secretary gets to \u201cclose to 1 million\u201d based on \u201cthe rough estimate of 2,700 people encountered per day in February,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nBut Nielsen is talking about apprehensions and inadmissibles, not just apprehensions \u2014 contrary to what the president tweeted in capital letters on March 7:\n\nWe can\u2019t predict the future, but the apprehensions data collected so far show the U.S. is not \u201con track\u201d to exceed 1 million apprehensions this fiscal year or even this calendar year.", "lang": "en"}
