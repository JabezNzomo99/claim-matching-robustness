Jerry Brown started showing up on Facebook with the text: \u201cSODOM AND GOMORRAH: CALIFORNIA GOV. JERRY BROWN TO FORCE SCHOOLS TO SHOW KIDS \u2018GAY SEX\u2019 AS PART OF INCLUSIVE LGBT CURRICULUM.\u201d\n\nThe claim started out on the notoriously unreliable website YourNewsWire, which posted this story in December 2017: \u201cCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown To Force Schools To Show Kids \u2018Gay Sex.\u2019\u201d Since then, it has been shared on 20 different Facebook pages and reached a social media audience of 2.8 million in total, according to data from Crowd Tangle.\n\nA month after it first went up, that story was copied and used with the headline that\u2019s now making the rounds on Facebook.\n\nAlthough that version of the story doesn\u2019t appear to have been shared widely, the photo and headline that were taken from it have been shared more than 32,000 times since being posted on Facebook on July 9.\n\nThe problem is, it\u2019s spreading misinformation loosely related to something that is true.\n\nIt is true that California amended its education law in 2011 to require the inclusion of \u201cthe role and contributions of\u201d lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans in the study of history for primary school students. The law had previously required the inclusion of contributions of \u201cboth men and women, Native Americans, African Americans\u201d and other ethnic groups \u201cto the economic, political, and social development of California and the United States of America.\u201d\n\nThe amended law took effect in 2012, but the new textbooks that reflect the curriculum change will be used for the first time in the 2018 school year \u2014 the new books were approved by the state\u2019s board of education in November 2017.\n\nThe books will include \u201ca more complete picture of the accomplishments and challenges faced by LGBT individuals in American history and culture, such as astronaut Sally Ride and comedian Ellen DeGeneres,\u201d according to a press release from California\u2019s superintendent of public instruction, Tom Torlakson.\n\nSchool districts aren\u2019t required to use the books, according to the release. They may choose to use other materials as long as they comply with the law.\n\nAnd nowhere in the law does it mandate \u201cthe use of gay pornography in elementary schools in order to teach children about LGBT sex,\u201d as the YourNewsWire story claims. That\u2019s purely made up.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nCalifornia State Board of Education. Minutes for the Nov. 8-9, 2017 meeting. Discussion is on page 19.\n\nTorlakson, Tom.
