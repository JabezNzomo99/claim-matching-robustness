Pacquiao denied making the offer and his spokesman told AFP it was a \u201choax\u201d.\n\nA day after Pacquiao\u2019s knock out over Argentine Lucas Matthysse on July 16, this post appeared online claiming the Filipino fighter was giving away houses to 60 people who liked a certain Facebook page.\n\n\n\nThe site hosting the report calls itself \u201cTeam Pacman Official\u201d, a reference to one of the nicknames for Pacquiao who has previously given away expensive gifts to people.\n\nThe headline of the post read: \u201cEarly Christmas Gift of Free Housing Because I Won In My Last Fight! - Manny Pacquiao\u201d.\n\nThe post claimed Pacquiao would choose 60 people to receive homes as long as they followed three steps. It said:\n\n\u201cBecause I won and the Philippines has won, I will give away something in goodwill. I will choose 60 people whom I will give a house and lot to. Just follow these instructions so you can be one of those people whom I can pick:\n\nAfter the post appeared, Pacquiao told reporters: \u201cThere is no truth in that\u201d.\n\nThe boxer\u2019s press team also said neither the website where the post appeared, nor the \u201cSen. Manny Pacman Pacquiao\u201d Facebook page were connected to Pacquiao.\n\n\u201cIt is not ours,\u201d Rene Casibang, Pacquiao\u2019s media officer, said of the Facebook page. This is the senator\u2019s official Facebook page.\n\nAs to the site, Casibang said: \u201cThat is a fake website\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
