The closest data we have to this is for homicides involving stabbings in London until the end of last year and those stabbings or shootings across the whole of England and Wales in 2016/17. These show increases over the last few years.\n\nWe contacted the Metropolitan Police who told us that it didn\u2019t generally give out an up-to-date running total on the number of homicides as these figures are published annually.\n\nSeparate figures on the number of homicides involving sharp instruments suggests that the numbers have stayed relatively flat since 2013/14 but increased in the first nine months of 2017/18 (the most recent figures available). We haven\u2019t found similar figures for shootings.\n\nEarlier this year the Metropolitan Police had told us there had been 38 fatal stabbings up until 20 April.\n\nLooking at the whole of England and Wales the number of homicides involving a sharp instrument had generally been decreasing over the past decade, but the number has increased in the past two years to 215 in 2016/17 (the most recent figures available), up from 212 in 2015/16.\n\nSimilarly the number of homicides involving a shooting had generally decreased to a low of 21 in 2014/15, but has increased for the last two years, to 32 in 2016/17.\n\nAround three-quarters of victims of homicides involving a sharp instrument in 2016/17 were male\u2014and the majority of those were under the age of 34. The proportion who were male has increased in recent years, but is just below the level it was in 2007/08 (the highest recorded in the last decade).\n\nOver half of all victims of firearms offences in 2015/16 were between the ages of 15 and 34\u2014not including air weapons and including all offences, not just homicides. Figures on the gender and age of the homicide victims who die in shootings aren\u2019t regularly published.\n\nIncreases in knife and gun crimes recorded by the police are partly down to improvements in recording practices, but the Office for National Statistics also put this down to a genuine rise.", "lang": "en"}
