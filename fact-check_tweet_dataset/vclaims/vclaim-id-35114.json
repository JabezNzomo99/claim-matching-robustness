On Dec. 9, the website Channel 45 News published a short post with the headline \u201cYNW Melly Stabbed to Death,\u201d along with a photograph of Demons and the following text:\n\n\u201cAuthorities said that it all happened in a prison riot between to [sic] gangs. Which left the victim found dead with a knife in his abdomen. YNW Melly stabbed to death!\u201d\n\nChannel 45 News invites users to \u201ccreate a prank and trick your friends\u201d by generating a vaguely authentic-looking fake news post from a headline and text inputted by the user, as shown below:\n\nAnother user posted a second fake article using the prank news generator NSFNews. That post had the headline \u201cYNW Melly Stabbed in Jail\u201d and reported that:\n\n\u201cJamall [sic] Maurice Demons otherwise known as YNW Melly has been stabbed while in jail. Authorities have confirmed Melly to be in critical condition this morning after a stabbing over a gang related incident. Melly encountered two gang members in the Jail who preceded to stab him multiple times. We will update more as the story continues.\u201d\n\nLike Channel 45 News, NSFNews invites users to \u201cWrite an article and prank your friends for fun.\u201d\n\nBased on these demonstrably fabricated stories, rumors of Demons\u2019 demise spread quickly on social media and other websites, including DeadDeath and Market News, which shared what they described as \u201cunconfirmed\u201d reports that the rapper had been killed.\n\nThe spread of the rumor was fueled in part by the fact that Demons was indeed in prison in December 2019, adding a modicum of credibility to claims that he had been killed there. In February 2019, Demons was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder and has since been incarcerated in Broward County Jail in Florida, according to prison records.\n\nThe rapper\u2019s mother, Jamie Demons, quickly dispelled rumors of her son\u2019s death, posting a short video to Instagram in which she explained: \u201cMelly is fine. I just talked to him this morning. He has not been injured whatsoever. He\u2019s fine, he\u2019s in great spirits, and he\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
