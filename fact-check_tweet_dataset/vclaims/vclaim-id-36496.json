This image has been used in a misleading context; it originated on a UK-based stock photo site and shows a patient suffering from a severe dermatological condition.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on March 10, 2020. It has been shared more than 5600 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cInter University JVP losers! You all should be hanged, white-vanned and used as food for crocodiles..The boy without a mother, was brought up by the father by working as a laborer..\u201d\n\n\u201cInter University JVP\u201d is a reference to the Inter University Students Federation, a confederation of students' unions in Sri Lanka, that is formally affiliated to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna party.\n\nThe post was published within days of an incident involving an undergraduate student at Sri Jayawardenapura University.\n\nThe student was hospitalised after suffering serious head injuries following an initiation ceremony involving a tractor tyre on March 6, 2020.

The photo is captioned: \u201cToxic epidermal necrolysis patient in ICU\u201d.\n\nToxic epidermal necrolysis is a life-threatening skin condition that often causes blistering and skin peeling, according to this explainer by the US\u2019 Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image on the stock photo site:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the stock photo image (R)\n\nPushpa Ramyani Zoysa, a Training Coordinator at Colombo National Hospital, also issued this statement on Facebook on March 10, 2020 explaining that the photo in the misleading posts does not show the hospitalised student.\n\nThe Sinhala-language post translates to English as: \u201cThe Jayawardenepura student is receiving treatment at the Intensive Care Unit. Don\u2019t circulate wrong claims. Also note that the image being circulated is not his picture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
