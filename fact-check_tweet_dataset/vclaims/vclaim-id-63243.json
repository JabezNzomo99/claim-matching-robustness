Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any evidence that any of Pelosi\u2019s four daughters sit on the board of the Kennedy Center. A spokeswoman for the Kennedy Center confirmed that Pelosi\u2019s children have no affiliation with the institution.\n\nThe Kennedy Center was allocated $25 million as part of the federal government\u2019s $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that was signed into law on March 27. Shortly thereafter, viral claims related to the Kennedy Center started circulating on social media platforms.\n\n\u201cSo Nancy\u2019s daughter is on the board of the Kennedy Center,\u201d claims one Facebook post. \u201cSo that\u2019s why it was so important to send them all that money.\u201d (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Hide $25 Million For Congressional Pay Raises In The Coronavirus Stimulus Bill?)\n\nThe House speaker has five children, according to the Washington Post. Of her children, she has four daughters: Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline and Alexandra.\n\nThere is no evidence that any of her daughters \u2013 or her son, for that matter \u2013 sit on the Kennedy Center\u2019s board. The Kennedy Center website does not list any of their names under its board of trustees or its \u201cExecutive Leadership and Artistic Leadership.\u201d A search for their names on the entire Kennedy Center website turned up no matchers either.\n\nNor do they appear to sit on the governing boards of the Washington National Opera or the National Symphony Orchestra, both of which are closely affiliated with the Kennedy Center.\n\nThe list of the Washington National Opera\u2019s Governance Board does not show any of the names of Pelosi\u2019s daughters, and neither does that of the Women\u2019s Committee of the National Opera.\n\nThe National Symphony Orchestra Board of Directors does not have Pelosi\u2019s children among its members, according to the Kennedy Center website. Nor does its list of national trustees.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Kennedy Center does list Pelosi as an ex-officio member of its board of trustees due to her position as House speaker. Other members include House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nMichelle Pendoley, a spokeswoman for the Kennedy Center, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that none of the House speaker\u2019s children are affiliated with the institution.", "lang": "en"}
