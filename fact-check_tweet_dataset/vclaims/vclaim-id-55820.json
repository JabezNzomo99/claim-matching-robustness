Typing 55 on a 999 call from a mobile when prompted is a way to alert the automated system that you need police assistance. You should not hang up as soon as you do this though.\n\nWhat happens if you can\u2019t speak on a 999 call?\n\nIf you need to call 999 for any reason the first person you will speak to is a BT operator\u2014they will direct your call to the relevant emergency service.\n\nIn some circumstances it may not be possible or safe for you to speak to the operator. Your call should still be transferred to the police by the operator if they hear suspicious noises, and you can also cough, tap the handset or make a noise to alert them.\n\nIf the call is silent and done from a mobile phone (not a landline), it will be forwarded to an automated system called \u201cSilent Solution\u201d. An automated voice asks the caller to press 55 if they need police assistance. You can listen to what happens on one of these calls here.\n\nThis will also direct the call to a police call handler. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which ran a campaign about Silent Solution last year, told us that people should not dial 55 then hang up.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Silent Solution system is used to filter out the many accidental or hoax 999 calls every day. If you press 55, when prompted, you are making it known it is a genuine emergency but you cannot speak. The BT call handler will then transfer you to the police.\u201d\n\nThe police will then ask a series of questions to try and get some more details about the situation. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) told us that \u201cCall handlers are highly trained to seek details from callers who may not be in a position to speak and so can use methods like tapping the handset or asking questions requiring only a yes or no answer.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, dialling 55 doesn\u2019t necessarily allow the police to determine your location. The NPCC also said \u201cPolice will not always send officers to silent calls so it is important for callers to try and provide as much information as they can \u2013 in any way they can.\u201d\n\nWhy does the automated system not apply to landlines?\n\nSilent Solution is not used on calls from landlines as, according to the NPCC, \u201cit\u2019s less likely that 999 calls are made by accident from landlines\u201d.\n\nThe Independent Office of Police Conduct says that on calls from landlines: \u201cif there is no request for an emergency, the caller does not answer questions, and only background noise can be heard and BT operators cannot decide whether an emergency service is needed\u201d then they will transfer the call to the police.\n\nThe guidance also says that if for any reason you disconnect the call on a landline by hanging up you have 45 seconds to pick it up again and the call will resume. If this happens (you hang up and pick up again within 45 seconds) the BT call handler will also forward the call to the police.", "lang": "en"}
