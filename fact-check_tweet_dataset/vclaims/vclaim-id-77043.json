Rob Portman called it \"a dangerous milestone\" and \"troubling evidence that our nation is headed in the wrong direction.\"\n\n \n\n In an attempt to put $16 trillion in terms everyday people can get their arms around, he also released a list of items showing how that much money stacks up -- such as \"$16 trillion in $1 bills would cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times.\"\n\n \n\n Sixteen trillion is a lot of kapusta -- but is it enough to carpet the countryside and turn Ohio green? Just for fun, PolitiFact Ohio decided to survey the landscape\n\n \n\n We got data from Portman staff's and checked the math. Here\u2019s how it works out.\n\u2022 A dollar bill has 16.0254 square inches. (It measures 2.61 inches by 6.14 inches.)\n\u2022 Sixteen trillion dollar bills multiply to an area of 256,406,400,000,000 square inches. That translates to 1,780,600,000,000 square feet (after you divide by 12 squared, or 144).\n\u2022 The area in square footage equals 63,870 square miles (after you divide by 5,280 squared, or 27,878,400).\n\nThat would cover Ohio's total area of 44,825 square miles 1.42 times -- or nearly 1.5 times.\n\n\n\n We ran the numbers again, using the land area of 40,860 square miles that the federal Census Bureau gives Ohio. Sixteen trillion singles would cover that area almost exactly 1.5 times.\n\n \n\n On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman's statement rates True.", "lang": "en"}
