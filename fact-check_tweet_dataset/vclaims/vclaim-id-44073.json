The claim is false, the image has been doctored from an original picture.\n\nThe image in this post uploaded on January 17 appears to show Trillanes wearing a black polo shirt with the characters \u201cDU30\u201d written in white on its right side during a trip to the city of Davao, the president\u2019s hometown.\n\n\u201cDU30\u201d is a nickname for Duterte, who was elected in 2016.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, translated into English, says: \u201cYou just went to Davao you're already wearing something with \u2018DU30\u2019 on it. But when you criticize the president, you do it ceaselessly\u201d.\n\nTrillanes is one of Duterte\u2019s staunchest critics.\n\nA reverse image search traced the photo back to a Facebook post by News5, a local online news channel, dated January 15.\n\nThe original image shows Trillanes wearing the same black polo shirt, but the right-hand side is blank and no \u201cDU30\u201d can be seen.\n\nThe caption of the News5 post, when translated to English, says: \u201cLOOK: Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV arrived at Davao RTC Branch 54 to face the libel case filed against him by former vice mayor Pulong Duterte and Atty. Mans Carpio\u201d.\n\nA libel case has been filed against Trillanes by Duterte\u2019s son, former Davao city vice mayor Paolo Duterte, also known as Pulong.\n\nA report by local news organisation ABS-CBN about the case also showed Trillanes wearing the same black polo shirt without \u201cDU30\u201d on it. Trillanes can be seen clearly at 2:37 minutes into the video.\n\nThe doctored image has been shared in Facebook groups which support Duterte and his political ally Alan Peter Cayetano and have tens of thousands of followers.", "lang": "en"}
