The tragic incident started trending on social media after celebrities and politicians condemned the inhuman ordeal. Many demanded that the perpetrators should be given the strictest punishment. Since then, several individuals are mocking the condition of \u2018education\u2019 in Kerala, the state with the highest literacy rate in the country. More importantly, as with most other issues in India, the helpless animal\u2019s death has provoked a wave of anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nBJP MP Maneka Gandhi tweeted, \u201cMallapuram is know for its intense criminal activity specially with regards to animals. No action has ever been taken against a single poacher or wildlife killer so they keep doing it.\u201d She claimed that the incident took place in Malappuram (misspelt as \u2018Mallapuram\u2019 in Gandhi\u2019s tweet), a Muslim-dominated district. Gandhi repeated the same in a byte to ANI.\n\nIn a tweet thread, Pakistani-Canadian author Tarek Fatah shared a report by NDTV and blamed Muslims for the elephant\u2019s death.\n\nThe report by NDTV shared by Tarek Fatah and several other individuals has now been updated. While it earlier claimed that the elephant died in Malappuram, the article\u2019s updated version reads Palakkad.\n\nThe author of the report Shylaja Verma tweeted a clarification that she got the district\u2019s name wrong.\n\nThat the incident occurred in Palakkad was also tweeted by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.\n\nKerala Forest Minister K Raju said the same.\n\nSeveral individuals either shared a link or a screenshot of the report by NDTV. Below is a tweet by Pratheesh Viswanath, founder of Hindu Sena Kendra. The article claimed that the elephant died in Malappuram.\n\nOther usual suspects who claimed that the incident took place in Malappuram were Arun Pudur, Payal Rohatgi and @IAmMayank_. Pudur wrote, \u201cNow tell me about 100% literacy & who is majority in Mallapuram?\u201d\n\nEnvironment Minister Prakash Javadekar also claimed that the incident occurred in Malappuram.\n\nNot only NDTV, but several other media outlets claimed that the tragic incident took place in Malappuram. In fact, many continue to misreport \u2013 Republic, Hindustan Times, Times Now, India TV, The Economic Times, India Today, ANI, News Nation, among others.\n\nAnother error later updated in NDTV\u2019s report\n\nA visible alteration in the report by NDTV, apart from the Malappuram misreport, is the change in the phrase \u201celephant fed pineapple stuffed with crackers\u201d to \u201celephant ate pineapple stuffed with crackers\u201d.\n\nThe investigation of the elephant\u2019s death is ongoing and the exact details of the incident are yet to be determined. However, the initial probe suggests that the wild animal was not directly fed a pineapple laden with firecrackers but she may have accidentally consumed it.\n\nSpeaking with Alt News, KK Sunil Kumar, Mannarkkad Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), said, \u201cThere is no evidence that pineapple was eaten by the elephant along with the explosives. She may have taken the explosive with any fruit, maybe pineapple. But this is an assumption. No such evidence was found in the postmortem.\u201d\n\nJournalist Dhanya Rajendra tweeted details about the postmortem report which says, \u201cInjuries in oral cavity, most likely due to an explosive blast in the mouth.\u201d\n\nKumar further stated that it is a common practice in forest areas for locals to place country bombs to keep away wild animals from agricultural land. \u201cIron wires are mostly used for the purpose so that when an animal tries to cross, the explosives burst and the animals are kept away. But sometimes people also use these explosives along with food for capturing wild boars or some other smaller animal. Perhaps this elephant ate such a material. We don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to forest department officials investigating the case, such snares known as \u2018panni padakam\u2019 (pig crackers) in Malayalam are commonly used to hunt down wild boars, usually for their meat. In other cases, farmers who wish to ward off wild boar attacks on their land also set up similar traps, although illegal,\u201d reads another report in The News Minute.\n\nPrincipal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) and Chief Wildlife Warden Surendrakumar told The News Minute that the elephant\u2019s injuries showed that she was wounded due to an explosive. \u201cThis much we can say for sure now. Who was behind it and what happened, we are investigating,\u201d he told the outlet.\n\nUsing explosives to kill, capture or wade off animals is a common practice employed in many states. Last year, a country-made explosive meant for animals went off killing one person in Telangana. A cracker meant to kill wild pigs exploded in Bengaluru in 2014 and injured two persons. In 2017, a cow had accidentally chewed one such explosive in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Vidisha. Soon after, false news promoted by ShankhNaad claimed that Muslims fed crackers to the cow. Alt News had debunked the communal misinformation. Our report can be read here.\n\nTo summarise, incorrect information put out by NDTV and several other mainstream media outlets led people to believe that the incident took place in Kerala\u2019s Malappuram district when in fact it happened in Palakkad. Since Malappuram is a Muslim-majority district, the case expectedly took an anti-Muslim turn. Furthermore, premature media reports blamed villagers for feeding a pineapple filled with firecrackers to the animal. However, the initial probe by forest officials suggests that she may have fallen prey to a trap that is meant to keep out animals from agricultural areas. The investigation is ongoing and an FIR has been registered against unidentified persons. More details are awaited.", "lang": "en"}
