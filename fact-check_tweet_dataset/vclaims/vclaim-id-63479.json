Accompanied by photographer Per-Anders Pettersson, Jolie\u2019s two-day visit was to assess the security situation of camps in Chad housing refugees from Sudan\u2019s troubled Darfur region.\n\nIn an article published on the SOS Children\u2019s Villages International website, Ms van den Broek tells how she and Jolie learned of a seven-year-old boy who needed help. They found the boy sitting on his own near his family\u2019s tent, naked and tied to a pole at the ankle.\n\nThe boy\u2019s mother explained that when her son was three and the family was in war-torn Darfur, a plane dropped a bomb on neighbour\u2019s house. His mother fled with him and her four other children to Chad. While living in a refugee camp the boy had tried to run away and injured himself. His mother, unable to do anything else, was forced to restrain him. Mr Pettersson captured the moment Jolie embraced the boy. The image can be seen on his website.\n\nIn two interviews with Newsweek (March 25, 2007 and March 10, 2017) Jolie spoke about meeting the boy. \u201cAs a first reaction you want to remove (the rope). But the mother, she has four other kids, she\u2019s by herself. Therapists visit him, but if (he\u2019s) left alone he will disappear or bang himself,\u201d she told the magazine.\n\nRegarding the use of his photo in the Facebook post, Mr Pettersson told AAP FactCheck in an email: \u201cThat is my image and it seems like it has been an unauthorised usage. I can\u2019t take any action in this matter as this specific image is controlled and distributed by Getty Images and Angelina Jolie. The reproduction of the image is not allowed.\n\n\u201cCropping and giving a false representation of the original image is not a nice thing. Unfortunately, people who like to do these things do it \u2013 it\u2019s hard to stop it.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Getty Images confirmed to AAP FactCheck in an email that the company distributed the full version of the picture, including \u201cthe boy\u2019s tethered ankle, with an accompanying caption that accurately described the scene\u201d.\n\nUNHCR spokesman for West & Central Africa Romain Desclous told AAP FactCheck via email: \u201cIt is our view that the FB post featuring a photograph of Ms Jolie at the Oure-Cassoni camp in eastern Chad is misleading and that there never were any efforts to hide anything as such by UNHCR nor by Ms Jolie, as the post appears to insinuate.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be false. While it is true Per-Anders Pettersson photographed Angelina Jolie as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador embracing a boy tethered by the ankle in Chad in 2007, he told AAP FactCheck the Facebook post\u2019s cropped image was a \u201cfalse representation\u201d of his original picture. Getty Images confirmed to AAP FactCheck it distributed the full version of the photo including \u201cthe boy\u2019s tethered ankle, with an accompanying caption that accurately described the scene\u201d. UNHCR spokesman for West & Central Africa Romain Desclous told AAP FactCheck the Facebook post is \u201cmisleading\u201d and that \u201cthere never were any efforts to hide anything as such by UNHCR nor by Ms Jolie, as the post appears to insinuate\u201d. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. NOTE: Updated May 26, 2020 to add Getty Images comment in the Statement and Verdict and amends third par in Statement.
