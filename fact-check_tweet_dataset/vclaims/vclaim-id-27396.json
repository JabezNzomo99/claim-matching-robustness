Let\u2019s try to analyze to what extent it is true. \n\n\n\nClaim: After the Ayodhya verdict, American President Donald Trump has fired \u2018Desi Katta\u2019 on the top of the White House and chanted \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019. Fact: The \u2018Breaking News\u2019 template of the \u2018Aaj Tak\u2019 news channel in the post is a photoshopped one. Also, information from no credible source was found which confirms that Donald Trump has celebrated the Ayodhya verdict by firing \u2018Desi Katta\u2019 on The White House. Hence the claim is FALSE.\n\nIn the post, the image had the \u2018Breaking News\u2019 template of AajTak news channel. So when searched on their YouTube channel if they have reported anything about Trump celebrating the Ayodhya verdict, no such reporting of them was found. When looked for their news videos aired during the Ayodhya verdict, many search results were obtained. In the image, when you observe the anchor and the background of the studio, a news video with similar visuals was found. In the video, it wasn\u2019t reported anywhere that Trump had fired \u2018Desi Katta\u2019 on The White House after Ayodhya verdict. Also, when you compare the \u2018Breaking News\u2019 template in the video with the one in the image posted, there are many clues that suggest that the latter one might be a morphed image. \n\n\n\nWhen Twitter Advanced Search was performed on the accounts \u2013 \u2018The White House\u2019(@WhiteHouse), \u2018President Trump\u2019(@POTUS) and \u2018Donald J. Trump\u2019(@realDonaldTrump) to find information regarding Trump celebrating the Ayodhya verdict, no such information was found. When googled if there are any news reports of Trump celebrating Ayodhya verdict at The White House, they were none. If such an act was really done by Trump, it wouldn\u2019t have gone unnoticed in the media. So, the \u2018Breaking News\u2019 template carrying such news about Trump celebrating the Ayodhya verdict is a photoshopped one. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, Donald Trump hasn\u2019t fired \u2018Desi Katta\u2019 on the White House after Ayodhya verdict. The image in the post is a photoshopped one. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
