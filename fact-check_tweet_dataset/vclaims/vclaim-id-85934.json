Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) makes a startling suggestion about Hillary Clinton's role in the Benghazi tragedy.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T18:22:27Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85934", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/02/21/issas-suspicions-that-hillary-clinton-told-panetta-to-stand-down-on-benghazi/", "vclaim": "A report by Republicans on the Armed Services Committee recently declared: \u201cThere was no \u2018stand down\u2019 order issued to U.S. military personnel in Tripoli who sought to join the fight in Benghazi.\u201d A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in January said: \u201cThe Committee has reviewed the allegations that U.S. personnel, including in the IC [Intelligence Community] or DOD, prevented the mounting of any military relief effort during the attacks, but the Committee has not found any of these allegations to be substantiated.\u201d\n\nIssa actually appears to acknowledge that, saying that it was not characterized as \u201cstand down.\u201d But then he uses the phrase again in a series of questions: \u201cWas there a stand-down order to Leon Panetta or did he just not do his job? Was there a stand-down order from the president who said he told them to use their resources and they didn\u2019t use them?\u201d\n\nGranted, Issa is speaking off the cuff in response to a question, so maybe precise clarity should not be expected. But he clearly suggests that someone \u2014 in particular possible presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton or even President Obama \u2014 told Panetta not to act. As he put it, \u201cWhy there was not one order given to turn on one Department of Defense asset?\u201d\n\nOf course, the deployment of forces by Panetta turned out to be pretty poor. It took six hours just for the units to prepare to depart for Libya. Not until 17 hours after Panetta issued the order did the CIF finally make it to the staging base in southern Europe. An hour later, one FAST platoon arrived in Tripoli. Thirty minutes after that, the Special Ops force from the United States arrived in Europe.\n\nHill noted that the Armed Services report \u201cdoes not draw a conclusion about whether the State Department sought to discourage, limit or constrain a military response.\u201d He added that it \u201cis undeniable that a Special Operations commander in Tripoli was given an alternative order when he intended to take his team to Benghazi as the attack raged,\u201d though \u201cChairman Issa acknowledged in New Hampshire that many do not consider this to have been a \u2018stand-down\u2019 order.\u201d He added that \u201cthe record is also clear that the State Department delayed the deployment of a Marine team that arrived in Tripoli the next day\u201d \u2014 this is in reference to the request from the Libyan government to remove military uniforms \u2014 and that State \u201cstopped the deployment of a multi-agency response team.\u201d (The CBS report that Hill cited also said the White House believed the Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST) was not necessary.)\n\nIt is correct that Issa poses a series of questions, but his repeated use of the phrase \u201cstand down\u201d and his personalizing of the alleged actions (\u201cSecretary Clinton;\u201d \u201cLeon\u201d) leave a distinct impression that either Clinton or Obama delivered some sort of instruction to Panetta to not act as forcefully as possible. He even incorrectly asserts that not a single order was given to use any DOD asset. One could argue the response was slow, bungled or poorly handled. But Issa is crossing a line when he suggests there was no response \u2014 or a deliberate effort to hinder it.", "lang": "en"}
