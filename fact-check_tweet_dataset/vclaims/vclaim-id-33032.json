The post carried a photo of Aquino with his head bowed down and with the Malaca\u00f1ang seal behind him.\n\nThe text read: \u201cIiwang utang ni Aquino kay Duterte $77 billion katumbas ng P6.4 trilyong piso with interest. Paano makakaalpas sa kahirapan ang sambayanang Pilipino? (Aquino will leave P77 billion worth of debt to Duterte, which is equivalent to P6.4 trillion with interest. How can the Filipino people be freed from poverty?)\u201d\n\nMarquez shared the post from Facebook group Senator Manny Pacquiao Supporters Worldwide, which was posted on July 29, 2019. Rappler also found the same content posted by Facebook page Imee Marcos Supporters on October 24, 2018.\n\nThe facts: When Aquino left office in June 2016, the country\u2019s national debt amounted to P5.9 trillion (P6.511 trillion with guaranteed debt) based on data from the Bureau of Treasury. But not all of these loans were incurred under the Aquino administration as the Facebook post suggests.\n\nIn a similar fact check article, economist JC Punongbayan explained that a government\u2019s outstanding debt is a \u201crunning total\u201d of how much the country still owes since new debt is incurred as old debt gets paid at any point in time. (READ: FALSE: Pie chart of Philippines' national debt under 3 presidents)\n\nThe best way to determine the total debt an administration incurred is to compute the net addition to the outstanding amount during its term, since the government also makes regular debt payments.\n\nIn this case, the net addition to the national debt under the Aquino administration only amounted to P1.37 trillion in 6 years, since the outstanding debt stood at P4.6 trillion when he first came into office in June 2010.
