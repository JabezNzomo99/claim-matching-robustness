Linebackers Malcolm Warner and Clyde Vargus along with right guard Jefferson Michaels and left tackle Mutombo Toki Del Fuego were seated at a corner booth. Ramsay walked over and introduced himself, telling them that he had followed all of the drama on TV, and invited them to join him at the pass for \"something special.\" LLOD correspondent Cynthia Luwhoe, who was enjoying a French Dip at the time, reported in on what happened next: \"Ramsay had the entire staff gather at the pass and instructed them to take a knee. 'You are four of the most disrespectfrul young men I've ever met, said Ramsay, 'my staff is better than that; better than you. You won'rt be getting service here tonight. F*ck off with the lot of you.'\"\n\nThe story is completely ficticious and not true at all. The roster for the Miami Dolphins (archived) doesn't even list anyone named Malcolm Warner, Clyde Vargus, Jefferson Michaels or Mutombo Toki Del Fuego.\n\nThe Resistance: The Last Line of Defense also carries a satire disclaimer at the bottom of the page which reads:\n\nIn a cynical world where the news of the day often seems fake, The Last Line of Defense offers today's busy conservative a place to go to read things they'll enjoy and congregate with a bunch of people they agree with. So while everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction, we are proud to present it to those who will have called it real anyway.\n\nThe owner/writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as asamericanasapplepie.org, ourlandofthefree.com and freedumjunkshun.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\".\n\nBlair's articles frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
