That\u2019s false.\n\nFacebook users rightly flagged stories about the arrest warrant as potentially false. The international police organization, INTERPOL, does not list Soros among those who have warrants out for their arrest.\n\nThe most recent version of the rumor has been circulating with the headline: \u201cPUTIN ISSUES INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANT FOR GEORGE SOROS.\u201d\n\nThe bogus story starts by saying: \u201cRussia has officially declared that Billionaire George Soros is a wanted man in their country, citing him and his organizations as a \u2018threat to Russian national security.'\u201d\n\nThat echoes part of a headline from Russia\u2019s government-run news outlet, RT, which announced the ban on two of his charities this way: \u201cProsecutors ban Soros Foundation as \u2018threat to Russian national security.\u2019\u201d The RT story doesn\u2019t explain why the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation were banned beyond saying they were deemed a \u201cthreat to the foundations of Russia\u2019s Constitutional order and national security.\u201d More important, it says nothing about Soros being wanted for arrest.\n\nThe false story goes on to reproduce part of a piece that ran on a website called Veterans Today in 2016. That piece confused Russia\u2019s ban on the charities with removing Soros from the country, and is largely made-up of a hodgepodge of quotes from a variety of sources.\n\nFor example, it quoted from a Rolling Stone article about the effect that Goldman Sachs has had on the American economy and then, without any evidence, stated: \u201cObviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs.\u201d The Rolling Stone article didn\u2019t mention Soros at all.\n\nThe story also quoted from a post on a Russian website during the 2016 presidential campaign that claimed Soros had rigged the outcome of the U.S. election.\n\nAlthough there is no truth to the claim that Putin has issued an arrest warrant for Soros, stories with that headline have been shared on Facebook more than 13,000 times.\n\n\u201cVladimir Putin to George Soros: Thank God we kicked you out of Russia.\u201d Veterans Today. 17 Aug 2016.", "lang": "en"}
