(The disgusting truth of farmer\u2019s protest, this proves that Congress\u2019 dogs were behind it. Share this to the max, so that people become aware- translated). The photo has been shared more than 32000 times so far from a Facebook page \u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u091f \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940(Great Narendra Modi).\n\nMultiple pages also had shared the same image with the exact text claiming that the protest was backed by Congress leaders and the party workers had coerced the farmers to join the protest by spilling their milk. The image was also shared more than 24000 times so far from another Facebook page \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u0928\u0938\u092d\u093e \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0915\u0938\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0926 BJP (Assembly Area Kasrawad).\n\nWhile a number of BJP leaning accounts have shared this image claiming the person is a Congress leader, a Twitter user Shumbham Amdhare countered this claim and said that the person in the photo is Prashant Pawar, an MNS leader from Nagpur.\n\nAlt News compared the viral image with a photograph of Prashant Pawar and found that the two match. Prashant Pawar was the Deputy City Chief of Nagpur for MNS. He quit the party two years back, and is currently the director of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, an NGO working for farmers\u2019 rights.\n\nPrashant Pawar in a conversation with Alt News regarding the allegation raised about his political allegiance said, \u201cI have no links with Congress except for being an NSUI student leader in 1984 and I have also left MNS from two years. These BJP goons don\u2019t know how to respond farmer\u2019s protest hence they are linking it with a political party. Our NGO is fighting for the farmers\u2019 rights from last five years\u201d. Moreover, Nagpur Today, a local News website based in Nagpur also confirmed that Prashant Pawar is an ex MNS leader and has no political links with Congress.\n\nWhile the source story published by ANI made no reference to political parties and leaders, it reported that a 10-day protest was organized by Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, a farmers\u2019 organisation. These are the images of the 4th day of protest when the farmers spilled their milk produce on the road in protest against Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh\u2019s recent remark on the agitation.\n\nMisinformation of this nature is usually part of a systematic political campaign that plays out on a daily basis on social media. In this instance, the Congress party has been targeted by the pro-BJP ecosystem.", "lang": "en"}
