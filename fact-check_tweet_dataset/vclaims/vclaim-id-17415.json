The financier has been accused of luring underaged girls to his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, to perform sex acts, according to the indictment. He previously faced similar charges in Florida in 2008 but took a plea deal that significantly reduced his sentence.\n\nBefore the allegations came to light, Epstein had a rich and powerful circle of friends. His impressive rolodex included politicians and celebrities like Trump, former President Bill Clinton and actor Kevin Spacey.\n\nEpstein and Trump were friends at one point, and Trump even spoke favorably of him in a New York Magazine spotlight, but they have since had a falling out, according to Trump, and the president allegedly barred Epstein from his Mar-A-Lago estate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,\u201d Trump told the magazine in 2002. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d This quote is accurately quoted in the meme.\n\nTrump and Epstein have been photographed together in the past. However, this image does not show one of those instances \u2013 it actually combines two separate pictures into one doctored image.\n\nThe Daily Caller easily traced the image of Trump and a young Ivanka to Getty Images. The photograph captures their appearance at the opening of the Harley Davidson Cafe in New York City, according to the caption.\n\nThe photograph of Epstein also comes from Getty, appearing on the first page of results with the search term \u201cJeffrey Epstein.\u201d He is attending a magazine launch in 2005 in the picture.", "lang": "en"}
