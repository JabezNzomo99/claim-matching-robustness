Li is also 55 years old, and the natural graying of hair associated with age coupled with glaring sunlight could have created an optical illusion making him appear to have aged rapidly.\n\nAlthough we have no medical doctors on staff who can diagnose a person by viewing a single photograph, we found no evidence that Li\u2019s health is in a downward spiral other than the fact he is abiding by the same rules regarding the passage of time as everyone else.\n\nLi\u2019s Los Angeles-based manager, Steve Chasman, attempted to dispel concern, telling the Washington Post that the actor (whose real name is Li Lianjie) has a chronic condition, but he is otherwise well:\n\nSpeaking to USA Today, Chasman said LI is in \u201cgreat shape\u201d and the photograph, which was taken in Tibet, is being blown out of proportion:\n\nPerhaps adding to the illusion that Li has aged more rapidly than expected is the fact he now wears his hair shaved as opposed to the thick shock of hair seen in many of his movies. He also has taken to wearing round-rimmed glasses. According images and videos posted to his social media accounts, Li started sporting a bald head in 2017:\n\n\n\n Although some news reports fretted that Li hasn\u2019t been seen on the big screen in recent years, he has simply has not been in the English-language arena. Instead, Li has been busy making Chinese-language films and television shows. He starred in and produced the action short film Gong Shou Dao in November 2017, playing the part of an old monk:\n\nSome took to social media in his defense, pointing out that aside from expected aging, Li looks like his old self:\n\n\n\n In early 2017, Li told fans he wanted to focus more of his efforts on humanitarianism through his nonprofit, the One Foundation, and his company Taiji Zen. Sporting his current look with a bald head and thick round glasses, he wished fans a happy New Year in 2018:\n\nLi announced in 2013 that he has hyperthyroidism , a condition that causes the thyroid gland to overproduce hormones. About one in 100 Americans have the condition, which can be treated with medication. A lifelong practitioner of martial arts who acts in movies full of dangerous stunts, Li has also had several serious injuries. Reports of ailments and injuries forcing Li off movie sets have floated around in news reports for more than a decade.\n\nWe reached out to Chasman but have not received a response. Chasman has distributed a grinning photograph of the actor to the news media (absent glaring sunlight) that he said better represents Li\u2019s physical condition.", "lang": "en"}
