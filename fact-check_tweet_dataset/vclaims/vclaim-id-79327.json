A picture of PM Narendra Modi sitting with folded hands in front of a framed photo is viral on social media recently. The post claims that PM Modi is paying tribute to Gandhi\u2019s assassin Nathuram Godse.\n\n Vishvas News investigation revealed the claim to be false. PM Modi can be seen with folded hands in front of Veer Savarkar and not Naturam Godse. The picture was captured in 2018 during PM\u2019s visit to the Cellular Jail in Port Blair. He can be seen paying tribute to Savarkar.\n\nFacebook user RV Sundar Raj uploaded a collage of two photographs on 18 August. In this collage, Prime Minister Narendra Modi can be seen paying tribute to Mahatma Gandhi above and the below picture depicts him sitting with folded hands in front of a framed photo that claims to be of Nathuram Godse.\n\n The post claims, (translated from Tamil to Hindi) \u201cNow say, what will people in our city (region, locality) call them? On one hand they pray to Mahatma Gandhi and on the other hand to Godse who shot him. India will grow. \u201c\n\n The archive link to this post can be seen here .\n\nWe cropped the pictures in the collage and searched for the actual images using Google reverse image search tool. We found many such pictures in which Narendra Modi can be seen with folded hands in front of the framed photo that claims to be of Gandhi\u2019s assassin Godse. \n\n Prime Minister had also uploaded it on his Twitter handle on December 30, 2018. The caption reads, \u201cThe great Veer Savarkar was one of the many people imprisoned in the Cellular Jail. I visited the cell where the unstoppable Veer Savarkar was kept. Even rigorous imprisonment did not break the fearless thinking of Veer Savarkar. He did not stop speaking and writing freely even while in jail. \u201c\n\nWe also accessed several media reports about PM\u2019s visit to the historic Cellular Jail of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Savarkar spent ten years in this prison.\n\nVishvas News then contacted Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga. \u201cThis claim is fake. The picture is of 2018 when Prime Minister folded his hands in front of Veer Savarkar\u2019s picture,\u201d said Bagga.\n\nNow we searched to find the other picture in the collage where PM is paying tribute to Gandhis statue. We found this picture on the website of indianexpress.com. The photo of PM Modi paying tribute to Gandhi was clicked in Rajkot during his visit to the Mahatma Gandhi Museum in September 30, 2018.\n\nNow we searched to find the other picture in the collage where PM is paying tribute to Gandhis statue.
