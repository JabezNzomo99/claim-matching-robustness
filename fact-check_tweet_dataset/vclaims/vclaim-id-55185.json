But Legionnaires\u2019 disease is caused by bacteria that festers mostly in warm, standing water, not in human saliva.\n\nThe latest falsehood to cast doubt on the safety of face masks makes the bogus assertion that wearing one can cause Legionnaires\u2019 disease. It can\u2019t.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a face covering to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. But the issue has become politicized and misinformation about masks is now common online. We\u2019ve already addressed several other related claims.\n\nThe latest example claims: \u201cMask wearers beware\u2026 \u26a0\ufe0f A caller to a radio talk show recently shared that his wife was hospitalized and told she had COVID and only a couple of days left to live. A doctor friend suggested she be tested for legionnaires disease because she wore the same mask every day all day long. Turns out it WAS legionnaires disease from the moisture and bacteria in her mask. She was given antibiotics and within two days was better. WHAT IF these \u2018spikes\u2019 in COVID are really something else due to mask wearing??\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know where this claim originated, but the first instance of it that we could find on Facebook was on a page for \u201cSetting The Record Straight with Ronald Dwyer,\u201d which described itself as a \u201cMedia/News Company.\u201d Dwyer did not respond to a call seeking comment and our message sent to the Facebook page administrator went unanswered.\n\nThe primary claim made in the post, which has been copied and shared widely on Facebook and Twitter, is false. People cannot get Legionnaires\u2019 disease from wearing a face mask, Dr. Janet Stout told FactCheck.org in a phone interview. Stout is the president and director of the Special Pathogens Laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and has studied that disease for decades.\n\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease was first documented during an American Legion convention in Philadelphia in 1976, which gave the disease its name. It is caused by bacteria, while COVID-19 is caused by a virus. Bacteria are single-cell organisms that can live in various environments, while viruses, which are smaller than bacteria, need a living host in order to multiply. We\u2019ve written before about that distinction.\n\nReferring to the bacteria, Stout explained, \u201cLegionella is not spread from one person to another.\u201d Rather, it is spread mostly by breathing in mist from infected water sources, which are usually warm and stagnant and commonly include hot tubs or air-conditioning cooling towers, according to the CDC. The disease can also be caused by drinking infected water if some of the water enters the lungs.\n\nThe bacteria would not be present in saliva, Stout said, so there would be no way for moisture from a person\u2019s own spit to cause Legionnaires\u2019 disease.\n\nThe two diseases \u2014 Legionnaires\u2019 and COVID-19 \u2014 do share some symptoms, though. Stout highlighted that they both cause high fevers, a cough, and sometimes diarrhea. They also endanger the same high-risk patients \u2014 the elderly and those with underlying diseases. So, she said, it\u2019s conceivable that doctors who have a heightened awareness of COVID-19 right now might initially mistake Legionnaires\u2019 disease for COVID-19. But the two diseases have different tests.\n\nThe COVID Tracking Project reports that, since Jan. 22, there have been more than 5 million positive COVID-19 tests in the U.S.\n\nFor Legionnaires\u2019 disease, the most recent data available from the CDC is from 2018, when there was a total of 10,000 reported cases in the U.S. That number, however, is probably lower than the actual amount of cases since the disease is likely underdiagnosed, according to the CDC.\n\nThe bottom line with regard to mask wearing and Legionnaires\u2019 disease, though, is that there is no connection. \u201cYou are safe to wear a mask,\u201d Stout said. \u201cYou should wear a mask.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
