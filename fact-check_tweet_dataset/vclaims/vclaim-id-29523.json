No, that's true: The claim published by right-wing websites -- including a warning that \"civil war is on the horizon\" -- are based on a single anonymous message thread on a right-wing social platform. It is a dangerous claim that could raise unnecessary fear, inflame passions, and lead to violence, according to an expert who monitors hate groups.\n\nThe claim originated in an article on Big League Politics which then was copied by other websites, including an article published by Right Wing Tribune on July 1, 2019 titled \"BREAKING: Antifa Reportedly Planning Chemical Attack In Washington D.C.\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story quotes the message thread from the unidentified \"POUND ON YOUR BOY\" account:\n\nOver the course of about 10 minutes last night, the \"POUND ON YOUR BOY\" account asked how the D.C. event is \"coming along\", and referenced muriatic acid multiple times.\n\n\n\n\"I just want to toss as many balloons of Muriatic acid in the faces as many Proud Boys I can [sic]\", wrote the user, \"I just want to blind as many of you c**k suckers are possible [sic].\" Oh, the Left-wing 'tolerance' and 'compassion.'\n\n\n\nThe user continued making threats and concluded his thread with, \"We already have the Muriatic acid, wax, and balloons.\"\n\nRight Wing Tribune only offers speculation that \"POUND ON YOUR BOY\" is a part of Antifa and has knowledge of the group's purported attack planning.\n\nWhile researching the \"POUND ON YOUR BOY\" name and cartoon profile photo associated with the Telegram account, Big League Politics was able to identify Twitter and Instagram accounts with the same phrase and artwork.\n\n\n\nThe artwork and phrase were created by Fagan Kuhnmuench, a Rolling Stone and Playboy journalist who repeatedly writes articles and social media posts sympathetic of Antifa. Kuhnmuench was contacted by Big League Politics and said that the account associated with his artwork is not his -- that he's not on the platform. He didn't provide any commentary about his artwork being used to threa.ten violence.\n\nThe story references the recent violence at a Portland, Oregon, protest in which journalist Andy Ngo was injured. Antifa and right-wing protestors clashed in the streets, as shown in this video:\n\nTo better assess the alleged threat on the Washington, D.C., rally, Lead Stories consulted Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Levin shares his definition of the group:\n\nLevin, who closely monitors threats on each side, says while he expects counter protests in Washington, there is not evidence of a violent plot:\n\nMany local Antifa chapters from around the country are planning to counter protest, and those events sometimes turn violent, but there are no confirmed reports of violent plots. Frequently in the run up to these protests violent rhetoric is often drummed up by both Antifa and their antagonists, and sometimes by imposters\n\nFalse news reports about violent plans are dangerous, he says:\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes rightwingtribune.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
