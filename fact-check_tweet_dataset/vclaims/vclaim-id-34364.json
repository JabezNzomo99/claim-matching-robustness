The claim is false; the photo is from a poster for the 2015 disaster movie San Andreas and the text has been recycled from an old hoax.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on November 7, 2019. It has been shared more than 20,000 times. The image was captioned with a lengthy warning of an imminent 7.1-magnitude earthquake in Manila, the Philippine capital, and its surrounding areas.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe first part of the Tagalog-language post translated to English states: \"WOW THERE'S ALREADY A WARNING ABOUT THE EARTHQUAKE\n\n\"From DRRM DepEd IMPORTANT TO LET EVERYONE KNOW \u2026\n\n\"Warning of Phivolcs to us all about an earthquake that will be experienced in Metro Manila. There is a 100 kilometer fault line that is currently in Bulacan, Quezon City, Markina, Pasig, Makati, Taguig, Muntinlupa, Rizal, Cavite and Laguna where an intensity 7.1 earthquake could be experienced.\n\n\"Government agencies studying the earthquake estimate that over 30,000 could die and over 100,000 could be injured or wounded.\u201d\n\nThe post purports to cite Phivolcs, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, and references DRRM, a disaster risk reduction and management team that the Department of Education (DepEd) formed in 2018. The areas mentioned in the post are cities within the Manila metropolitan area and its neighboring provinces.\n\nSimilar posts without the image have also been shared on Facebook here on November 3 and on Twitter here on November 4.\n\nBut the claim is false, and the photo has been used in a misleading context.\n\nA reverse image search and subsequent keyword search found this stock photo published by UK-based photo agency Alamy of the poster for San Andreas, a disaster film from 2015. A textless version of the poster can be found here on Moviemania, a website that publishes movie wallpapers.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison showing the misleading photo (L), the Alamy stock photo (C) and the textless San Andres poster (R):\n\nThe caption in the misleading post was recycled from an old hoax previously debunked by AFP on April 24. As it did in April, Phivolcs again this month posted statements on Facebook here and on Twitter here refuting the purported warning.\n\nThe agency\u2019s post on Facebook, written in a mix of Tagalog and English, states: \u201cAGAIN A REMINDER FROM DOST-PHIVOLCS:\n\n\u201cThe PHIVOLCS-DOST does NOT GIVE PREDICTIONS about earthquakes.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is prepare earthquake scenarios of hazards and impacts to be used as a guide for mitigation, preparedness, and response.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Phivolcs post:\n\nThe Tagalog-language infographic attached to Phivolcs\u2019 post quotes the first part of the misleading post.\n\nTranslated to English, the infographic adds: \u201cWe would like to let the public know that this message did not come from DOST-PHIVOLCS and our agency does not have enough basis to release a warning about an imminent big earthquake. At present, there is no technology in the world that can predict a big earthquake. Regardless, DOST-PHIVOLCS continues to monitor areas where earthquakes originate to provide adequate advisory based on gathered data especially when there are unusual events happening there.\n\n\u201cWe urge those who have received the message to refrain from spreading it through text and internet.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
