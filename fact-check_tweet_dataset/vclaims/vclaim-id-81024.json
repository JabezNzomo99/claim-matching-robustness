The claim is false; the deer has fibromatosis, a benign skin condition caused by a viral infection.\n\nThis Facebook post, published October 13, 2017, and shared more than 134,000 times since, contains the image alongside a Japanese-language caption.\n\nThe caption, translated to English by AFP\u2019s Tokyo bureau, says: \u201cA deer covered with tumours after eating plants sprayed with Monsanto's Roundup. It appears there are quite a lot,\u201d meaning that there seem to be many deer with the same condition.\n\nMonsanto is an agro-chemical company owned by German pharmaceutical giant Bayer, this is its website.\n\nRoundup, a weedkiller brand produced by Monsanto, has been accused of causing cancer in humans. Here is an AFP report published on May 14, 2019, about the legal proceedings brought against the company.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same photo has been shared alongside similar claims elsewhere on Facebook, for example here and here, and on Japanese blogging website Ameba here and here. Some of these posts also claim that the deer is in Japan.\n\nThere is text in English and Japanese at the top of the image in the misleading Facebook posts which says, translated to English: \u201cPost by Your Wild Ohio - Hunter\u201d.\n\nThe \"about\" section here of the Facebook page called \u201cYour Wild Ohio - Hunter\u201d states its association to Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Wildlife, a US state government agency.\n\nThe Facebook post embedded below, posted here by the \u201cYour Wild Ohio - Hunter\u201d on October 12, 2017, contains the same image as in the misleading post:\n\nThe caption of the post says, in part: \u201cHave you ever seen deer with these odd growths? These unsightly growths are called fibromas. We encounter fibromas in Ohio deer frequently.\u201d\n\nFibromas in deer are caused by a viral infection, not by chemicals, according to multiple sources of scientific and specialist information available online.\n\nNone of the pages reviewed by AFP mention weedkiller or any other chemicals as the cause of these tumours.\n\nFor example, the Pennsylvania Game Commission has an information page on fibromas in wildlife here. It says, in part: \u201cFibromas are wart-like growths on the skin caused by viruses which are host species specific.\n\n\u201cDifferent species of poxviruses cause fibromas in different species of wild and domestic animals. Deer fibromas can be caused by poxviruses, but are more commonly the result of papillomavirus infections.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the site, which includes a picture of another deer with fibromas in the bottom right-hand corner:\n\nThis article in the Canadian Veterinary Journal titled \u201cDeer Fibroma: A Review\u201d describes deer fibromas as \u201coften dark brown to black, with a smooth or wrinkled surface\u201d.\n\nThe article also says: \u201cVirus particles, similar to those found in fibrous skin tumors of several wild and domestic species, have been identified in some species\u201d.\n\nAnd the text on this page titled \u201cFibromatosis in deer\u201d on the website of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife says that deer fibromas are caused by a virus.\n\n\u201cDeer with fibromatosis are generally unaffected by the condition,\u201d it says; below is a screenshot of the information page, which contains a picture of a deer with fibromas:", "lang": "en"}
