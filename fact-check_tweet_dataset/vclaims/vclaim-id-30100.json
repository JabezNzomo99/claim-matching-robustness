Often, the request for the order will come from relatives or friends concerned about a loved one who owns one or more guns and has expressed suicidal thoughts or discussed shooting people. The authorities may also request an order. How long the guns are taken away under these \u201cextreme risk protection orders\u201d depends on the circumstances, and can usually be extended only after another court hearing. The orders also bar the person they cover from purchasing guns\n\nIn general, red flag laws authorize courts to issue a special type of protection order that allows police to temporarily confiscate firearms from persons deemed by judges to be a danger to themselves or to others. Advocates argue that such laws can help save lives without infringing on civil liberties, while opponents maintain that \u201cred flag\u201d seizures violate constitutional due process guarantees.\n\nIn February 2018, a few weeks after a mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida left 17 people dead, U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence Trump met with lawmakers to discuss the subjects of gun laws and school safety. Nikolas Cruz, the suspected shooter, had been able to legally purchase an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle even though local police had previously received multiple calls about his potentially dangerous behavior, a subject that Trump and Pence discussed at that meeting.\n\nAs can be seen in this video clip, Pence began speaking on the subject of how red flag laws were one mechanism that might provide \u201clocal law enforcement additional tools if an individual is reported to be a potential danger\u201d while still allowing for due process. Trump interrupted and twice expressed the desirability of being able to take firearms away from citizens first and not involving the courts until afterward:\n\nPence: Well, the category you spoke about Mr. President \u2014 the gun violence restraining orders as they\u2019re called \u2014 California actually has a version of this, and I think you \u2026 in your meeting with governors earlier this week, individually and as a group we spoke about the state\u2019s taking steps. But the focus is to literally give families and give local law enforcement additional tools if an individual is reported to be a potential danger to themselves or others. Allow due process so that no one\u2019s rights are trampled, but [allow] the ability to go to court, obtain an order, and then collect not only the firearms, but any weapons in the possession \u2026 Trump: We\u2019re going to take the firearms first and then go to court, because that\u2019s another system. Because a lot of times by the time you go to court \u2026 it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures. I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man\u2019s case that just took place in Florida; he had a lot of fires [and] they saw everything. To go to court would have taken a long time, so you could do exactly what you\u2019re saying but take the guns first, go through due process second.\n\nWhat Trump might have meant by his interjection here is difficult to discern. Critics of red flag laws have argued that even though court proceedings may be required before firearms are confiscated from residents, those proceedings don\u2019t meet the standards of \u201cdue process\u201d because respondents are not guaranteed representation in court (since such proceedings are civil rather than criminal), and they do not have the right to fully argue their cases in court before confiscation orders are issued and acted upon.\n\nPerhaps Trump meant that initial court involvement should only be cursory in such cases to facilitate the necessity of acting quickly, while fuller court hearings could wait until after the potential danger has been neutralized. But the language he used certainly sounded to many like Trump was advocating that law enforcement be allowed to confiscate guns from citizens without any prior court involvement whatsoever.", "lang": "en"}
