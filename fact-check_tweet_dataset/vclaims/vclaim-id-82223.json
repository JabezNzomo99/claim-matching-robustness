But she failed to consider that even if a company pays little or no income taxes, it pays plenty in other taxes, such as property taxes. In every case we checked, the companies paid more in taxes, and so Clinton earned Four Pinocchios.\n\n2: Bush\u2019s claim that Islamic State \u2018didn\u2019t exist when my brother was president\u2019\n\nThis sweeping statement by the former Florida governor fell apart under scrutiny as the Islamic State was founded in 2006, when his brother was president, and al-Qaeda in Iraq was never \u201cwiped out,\u201d as he also claimed.\n\nWarren made this claim based on a study by the Center for Responsible Lending, but the report was very sketchy, because it did not disclose that it was based on data for subprime loans. The underlying data source also showed different figures. Moreover, Warren incorrectly characterized the findings of the report. So she earned Four Pinocchios.\n\n4: Setting the record straight on measuring fetal age and the \u201820-week abortion\u2019\n\nThis was an informational article to explain a little-known difference between two methods of counting gestational age that contributed to inconsistent media coverage about a bill that proposes to ban abortions after \u201c20 weeks.\u201d\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif earned two Pinocchios for making a claim about the size of Israel\u2019s nuclear arsenal that far exceeded most mainstream estimates.", "lang": "en"}
