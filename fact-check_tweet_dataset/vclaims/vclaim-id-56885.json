The implication of the post seems to be that the new coronavirus and a vaccine were manufactured before the outbreak.\n\nThese claims, and the implication of the post, are wrong. We\u2019ve seen no credible evidence that Covid-19 was man-made.\n\nThe US patent mentioned in the post\u2014US2006257852\u2014has nothing to do with the new coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIt\u2019s a patent issued in 2006 for a range of approaches to detecting, treating and preventing SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome of which there were outbreaks between 2002 and 2004), according to the US National Library of Medicine. It has been abandoned, so isn\u2019t currently active.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written about before, \u201ccoronavirus\u201d is a broad category of viruses which infect both humans and animals, which includes the original SARS virus, some viruses that cause conditions like the common cold, as well as the virus (technically known as SARS-CoV-2) causing the current pandemic.\n\nThe post goes on to mention a European patent\u2014EP3172319B1\u2014which it claims is for a vaccine for the new coronavirus. This patent is still active.\n\nAgain, this is not related to the new coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s for a vaccine for a virus which infects birds, which is another type of coronavirus. Speaking to journalists in France, the proprietor of the patent said:\n\n\u201cThe European patent EP3172319B1 was not filed in relation to novel virus SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe Institute was granted this patent in 2018 for a new approach to vaccine development in order to make improved infectious bronchitis virus vaccines for poultry. There are no plans for its use in human coronavirus vaccine development.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post goes on to claim that the owner of this patent is a corporation owned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe owner is the Pirbright Institute, based near Woking. As we\u2019ve fact checked recently, it receives some funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but isn\u2019t owned by them and receives funding from a range of other sources.", "lang": "en"}
