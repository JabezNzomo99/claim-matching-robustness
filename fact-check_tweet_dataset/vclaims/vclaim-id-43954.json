No, that's not true: The viral video does not actually demonstrate what it claims in the header, and viewers have to watch the entire clip to realize the \"remedy\" is unproven.\n\nThe claim originated from a video published by Dr Heng Soy on December 9, 2019, titled \"White Hair To Black Hair Naturally in Just 4 Minutes Permanently | 100% Works At Home\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe video claims that a mixture of onion juice, Colgate toothpaste and lemon juice can be applied to one's white or gray hair, and it will become black hair permanently. A user by the name of Dr. Heng Soy demonstrated the procedure in a four-minute video being shared online.\n\nAt the end of the video, the YouTuber does not use the \"home remedy\" on his or anyone else's scalp. Instead, he rubs it on his hairless hand. There is no visible change to his hand after applying the concoction.\n\nHair grows half-an-inch a month on average, so it is a stretch to claim this home mixture can cause a permanent fix.\n\nStill, does onion juice help reverse gray hair? An article in Healthline mentioned onion as one of many possible home remedies that natural health advocates believe reverses gray hair. The article said:\n\nThe remedy is unproven, though. Dr. Heng Soy's channel also demonstrates other hair treatments using different ingredients, such as eggs and lime juice. Regardless, the conclusion of this video did not match the original assertion, and this is nothing more than a \"clickbait\" video encouraging people to put, among other things, toothpaste in their hair.\n\nWe wrote about fake news on YouTube before.
