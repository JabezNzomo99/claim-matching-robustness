On 27th August Monday, Ghafoor called Niru home for some work and then he ran away after beating and raping Niru -translated) The tweet has now been deleted.\n\n\n\nTwitter user Komal (@komal44337466) who posted this message now faces an FIR by UP police on the charge of \u201csharing fake and inflammatory post aimed at inciting communal hatred\u201d. Many users on Facebook and Twitter have shared the same images claiming a Hindu woman in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh was raped by a Muslim Congress leader.\n\nAnother Facebook user had posted the same image with exact text in a public group BJP SOCIAL MEDIA. The group has more than 7 lakh members.\n\nNavbharat Times had earlier fact-checked the claim. A Google reverse image search of the image where a woman is tying a rakhi shows that it is an old image. An image posted by a Twitter user on August 7, 2018 was one of the earliest instances we could find. The tweet promotes communal harmony stating, \u201csome relations are beyond religion and Love and Hate have no religion (translated).\u201d Hence, it cannot be representative of an incident claimed to have happened recently.\n\nAlt News also did a Google reverse image of the injured woman\u2019s picture and found an Associated Press image taken by photographer Rajesh Kumar. The caption reads, \u201cAn injured passenger recovers at a hospital at Kanpur, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, India, Monday, Nov. 21, 2016. Scores of passengers died and scores more were injured after 14 coaches of an overnight passenger train rolled off the track.\u201d\n\nGonda Police tweeted a clarification busting the rumours circulating about a woman raped in the district. The tweet refuted the claims made on social media stating, \u201cThe photo included in the mentioned viral post dates back to November 21, 2016 and represents an incident where a woman was injured in a train accident in Kanpur,Uttar Pradesh. Hence this incident is completely unfounded and false (translated).\u201d\n\nMaking false claims on the basis of unrelated images has been a tried and tested tactic of pages and accounts that seek to increase the chasm of communal divide. A photo shared in 2017 to promote harmony between two communities was maliciously used to foment communal strife.", "lang": "en"}
