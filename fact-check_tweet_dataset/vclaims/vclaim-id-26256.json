The claim is false; the video has been edited from a longer video of Gandhi\u2019s speech at a political rally in October 2019 in which he described how two fugitive Indian businessmen had settled abroad.\n\nThe 11-second long video was published here in a Facebook post on October 13, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 1,400 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThis is the reality of the Gandhi family. They have taken people for granted as their ancestral property, threatening to settle in London and send his children to study in the USA. He should be sent to London today or better to send him his real home Pakistan. Treason has been in their blood for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe Hindi language text superimposed on the video translates to English as: \u201cRahul Gandhi and his children will settle down in London.\u201d\n\nRahul Gandhi is the former president of India\u2019s main opposition Indian National Congress party.\n\nThe video was also published on Facebook, here, here and here, and here, here, here and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; a reverse image search on Google of keyframes obtained using video verification tool InVid found the full video of Gandhi\u2019s speech published here on the website for Indian news channel ABP on October 13, 2019.\n\nLatur is a town and central district in the Indian state of Maharashtra.\n\nA keyword search found the same video of his full speech was also published here on the official YouTube channel of the Indian National Congress on October 13, 2019.\n\nIn the longer 18 minute 48 second clip, Gandhi referred to two fugitive Indian businessmen, who he suggested could flee India in order to avoid charges of money laundering and banking fraud.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video (L) and the Congress official YouTube channel video (R):\n\nThe short video clip in the misleading Facebook post corresponds with the longer video from the 15 minute 10 second mark to the 15 minute 38 second mark of the YouTube video.\n\nIn the original speech as seen in the YouTube video, Gandhi\u2019s comments at this point translate to English as: \u201cFarmers are afraid, they remain awake the whole night thinking about how to pay their loan. Whereas, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi can sleep well without any fear. Nothing will happen, I will go to London, my children will go to study in America, I have nothing to do with India. I am Narendra Modi\u2019s friend, I have millions of rupees, I will go anytime. This is the reality of India.\u201d\n\nIn the edited misleading clip, Gandhi appears to say: \u201cI will go to London, my children will go to study in America, I have nothing to do with India. I have millions of rupees, I will go anytime.\u201d\n\nThe audio has been edited to remove the phrase \"I am Narendra Modi's friend\", referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nNirav Modi and Mehul Choksi are fugitive Indian jewellers, who are wanted by the authorities over charges of money laundering and banking fraud. This report published by Indian newspaper The Economic Times on October 12, 2019, outlines the allegations against them.", "lang": "en"}
