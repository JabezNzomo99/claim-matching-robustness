As of this writing, the death toll has reached 24, according to CNN.\n\n\"My thoughts and prayers are with our brothers and sisters in Houston,\" Mayweather is quoted. \"My initiative is donating $200m to the entire Houston community to assist and house victims of the devastating flood that has rendered people homeless. The fund is intended to provide shelter, food, clothing and medicines.\"\n\nFacebook users also flagged the same assertion on a couple of other websites.\n\nThere is no credible report that Mayweather, pictured below, has made a contribution that large.\n\nMayweather\u2019s name likely became a target for fake news writers after he won a guaranteed $100 million for his Aug. 26 boxing match against MMA fighter Conor McGregor (his share of money from the fight could climb as high as $300 million).\n\nHoustonChronicle-tv.com is not the website for a TV news station, or the Houston area\u2019s real newspaper, the Houston Chronicle. It\u2019s a fake news site that we\u2019ve listed on our Fake News Almanac as mimicking a legitimate media outlet.\n\nWhile Mayweather does have a foundation that aids and promotes community groups, there has been no news that the foundation or the boxer have given money out specifically for hurricane relief.\n\nAnother sign the story is fake is that the same unsubstantiated details have been attributed to other boxers. This same story has already been reused, almost word-for-word, to say that boxer Manny Pacquiao gave $50 million to the city for hurricane relief.\n\nHow or why this post has ended up on other sites is hard to say, but it doesn\u2019t go the distance on our Truth-O-Meter. We rate it Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
