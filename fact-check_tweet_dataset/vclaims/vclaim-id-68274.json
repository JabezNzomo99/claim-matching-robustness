According to to the bureau\u2019s estimates, Texas ranked first at that time, with 25.5 percent uninsured. New Mexico followed, with 22.6 percent, and then Florida, 20.9. Nationally, 15.8 percent were uninsured, according to the data, with Massachusetts having the fewest uninsured, 5.1 percent.\n\nAn October 2008 policy paper by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation notes that \"Texas has the unfortunate distinction of leading the nation in the number of uninsured citizens,\" but takes issue with the Census Bureau\u2019s methodology, which \"includes anyone uninsured at the time the survey is taken.\"\n\nSeparately, we found a national poll indicating Texas ranked No. 1 in uninsured residents the first half of 2010.\n\nAccording to the Gallup poll, an average of 26.8 percent of Texas residents were uninsured. Mississippi trailed in second (25.8 percent), followed by Louisiana (24 percent). California landed fifth, with 21.9 percent. And Massachusetts, which requires residents older than 18 to have health coverage, ranked again as the state with the smallest percentage of uninsured residents: 4.9 percent. Gallup said it interviewed 176,193 adults from Jan. 2-June 30, 2010.\n\nBy available indicators, Texas has the nation\u2019s highest percentage of uninsured residents. We rate Krugman\u2019s statement as True.", "lang": "en"}
