She said so in an unscheduled online press conference, when she announced that President Rodrigo Duterte had approved the memorandum.\n\nIn a statement posted on the Department of Education (DepEd) official Facebook account, Briones cited the implications of Duterte\u2019s decision to revert Metro Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, Laguna and Rizal to modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) from general community quarantine (GCQ) from Aug. 4 to 18. She said the education department will use the six-week deferment of school opening to fill in the remaining gaps in the preparations, especially \u201clogistical limitations\u201d faced in areas formerly under MECQ.\n\nThe scenario was completely different just four days before Briones announced the change in the school calendar. In an online press briefing on Aug. 10, she insisted that classes will \u201cpush through\u201d considering that there will be no \u201cface-to-face\u201d classes and that students will use new modes of learning such as online, radio, television and printed modules.\n\nTeachers\u2019 group Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) suggested on Aug. 5 the deferment of school opening due to what it called a \u201cfailed state of preparations.\u201d Among many other issues, it cited that several teachers have not yet received copies of learning modules, the most preferred learning materials by parents, and were burdened with shouldering the costs of printing modules.\n\nAs of Aug. 20, the total number of enrollees for school year 2020-2021 is at 23.5 million or 84.73 percent of enrollees from the previous year, according to DepEd.\n\nAn advisory from DepEd on Aug. 15 stated that private schools that have already started classes or were scheduled to resume before Oct. 5 may proceed, provided that they will do so only through \u201cdistance learning modalities\u201d and that there will be \u201cno face-to-face classes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the dry run for DepEd schools for new learning modes will push through for the next school year, which will be from Oct. 5, 2020 to June 16, 2021, according to Briones.\n\nDepartment of Education official Facebook, Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones makes an important announcement as regards to the opening of classes for SY 2020-2021, Aug. 14, 2020\n\nDepartment of Education official Facebook, Statement of Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones\n\nOn the Opening of Classes, Aug. 14, 2020\n\nDepartment of Education official Facebook, Alternative learning delivery methods, May 11, 2020\n\nRappler.com, 3 weeks into school opening, teachers say they still don't have copies of learning modules, Aug. 5, 2020\n\nManila Bulletin, Parents prefer modular learning for their children this school year, DepEd survey finds out, July 30, 2020\n\nDepartment of Education official Facebook, Total Number of Enrollees as of 20 August 2020, Aug. 20, 2020\n\nDepartment of Education website, Advisory on Opening of Classes for Private Schools, Aug. 15, 2020\n\nDepartment of Education official Facebook, School Calendar for SY 2020-2021, Aug. 18, 2020\n\nDepartment of Education official Facebook, Patuloy ang pagsasagawa ng dry runs at iba pang mga naunang paghahanda\u2026, Aug. 18, 2020", "lang": "en"}
