Washington said Moscow had violated the pact by developing a new land-based cruise missile, a claim which the Kremlin has denied.\n\nBut does Putin\u2019s so-called \u201cguided fireball\u201d live up to the hype?\n\nInitially, news of the system prompted dire assessments from some U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cWe don't have any defense that could deny the employment of such a weapon against us, so our response would be our deterrent force, which would be the triad and the nuclear capabilities that we have to respond to such a threat,\u201d The Hill cited Gen. John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, as telling the Senate Armed Services Committee in March.\n\nJames Inhofe, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, offered this critical assessment: \u201cRight now, we\u2019re helpless.\u201d\n\nIn December, the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report saying: \u201cChina and Russia are pursuing hypersonic weapons because their speed, altitude, and maneuverability may defeat most missile defense systems, and they may be used to improve long-range conventional and nuclear strike capabilities.\u201d\n\nThe report added: \u201cThere are no existing countermeasures.\u201d\n\nAnd AP cited Putin as saying no other country currently has hypersonic weapons.\n\nBut that claim is inaccurate, according to nuclear policy specialist Alicia Dressman.\n\n\u201cWe've had \u2018hypersonic missiles\u2019 since the development of the ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile). That's a catch-all term that focuses on the speed of the missile, which isn't what makes a boost-glide weapon special,\u201d she told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cIt's all about the maneuverability of the reentry vehicle, so the hypersonic glide vehicle is carried by an ICBM, and can maneuver upon reentry, evading interceptor missiles from a missile defense system, essentially acting like a cruise missile.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, not everyone has taken Russia\u2019s claims about the system at face value.\n\nFor example, tech writer Mike Wehner said despite the bold claims surrounding Avangard, U.S. military experts have questioned the system\u2019s ability to live up to the claims.\n\n\u201cThis new test and video footage of the launch doesn\u2019t necessarily prove that Avangard is as unbeatable as Russia says it is, but showing off the weapon in action is obviously a step in that direction,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn March, outgoing U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis said Avangard and other weapon systems being developed by Russia would not change the U.S. \u201cdeterrence posture.\u201d\n\n\"As I went through and looked at the clips of what (Putin) showed on the videos... I saw no change to the Russian military capability and each of these systems that he's talking about that are still years away, I do not see them changing the military balance,\" AFP cited Mattis as saying.\n\nIn October, U.S. Defense Department spokesman Eric Pahon told CNBC he remained skeptical about Russia's hypersonic development.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian attempts to develop high-tech weaponry is something we watch closely. To this point, however, we've seen more grandiose claims of success than actual proof,\" Pahon said. \u201cWe are continuing to develop our own defensive capabilities and improve readiness for both ourselves and our allies to counter any threats the Russians may develop.\"\n\nAnd like Mattis, some experts have doubts Avangard is on the cusp of being deployed.\n\nWhen The National Interest, an international affairs magazine, asked Michael Kofman, a research scientist with the Center for Naval Analyses, a U.S. federally funded research and development center, what were the chances Avangard would be fielded by 2019, he said \u201cnone.\u201d\n\nIn October, CNBC reported that Russia was struggling to find a source of critical carbon fiber components needed to make Avangard.\n\n\"The body of the hypersonic glide vehicle cannot withstand the heat on (atmospheric) re-entry, and therefore the internal systems fail,\" CNBC quoted a person with direct knowledge of a U.S. intelligence report on the system as saying. \"The Russians therefore need a better material because they have an upcoming test and they don't think the material used to construct the body provides enough thermal protection.\"\n\nRT itself noted on December 27 that the \u201chighly classified\u201d glider has not been shown to the public, while the video of the test released by the Russian Defense Ministry \u201cshowed only the launch of the carrier vehicle, but not the deployment of the glider, its flight or the moment it hit the target.\u201d\n\nDressman said Russia has been testing hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) atop ICBM launchers since about 2007, but they\u2019ve only \u201crecently started packaging launches for public or internal consumption.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don't have enough open data to assess the performance of the glide vehicle,\u201d she said, adding that reports of failed flight tests are \u201cnothing like what we've witnessed routinely with the Bulava (submarine-launched ballistic missile) flight tests for the Russian Navy.\u201d\n\nPrior to Wednesday, sources with direct knowledge of U.S. intelligence reports on the issue told CNBC that Russia had successfully tested Avangard twice in 2016, while an October 2017 test ended in failure when the platform crashed seconds before striking its target.\n\nUltimately, Dressman said \u201cskepticism is warranted with any development-phase system, including our own ballistic missile defense technology.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe don't have cruise missile defense, at any stage of development. That would be a system which would respond to an HGV, for instance.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Putin\u2019s claim that Avangard is \u201cinvulnerable\u201d to existing and prospective systems alike is potentially misleading.\n\nKonstantin Sivkov, a military expert and corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Rocket and Artillery Sciences, wrote in July that countering such systems could be possible through the deployment of systems operating under \u201cnew physical principles,\u201d citing lasers as an example.\n\nFor now, Polygraph.info finds claims surrounding Avangard\u2019s capabilities following the most recent test to be unclear.", "lang": "en"}
