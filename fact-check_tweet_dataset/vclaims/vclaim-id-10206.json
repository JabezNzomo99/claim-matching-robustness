The full text of the hoax read:\n\nThe news was not confirmed on the line up page of the Rebellion festival taking place August 2-5th in Blackpool, UK. According to Songkick the last Siouxsie and The Banshees concert took place over 9 years ago an no upcoming ones are planned. The largest Siouxsie & The Banshees page of Facebook is also silent on the 'news'.\n\nAll that makes sense since the band was officially disbanded in 1996, with only a brief reunion in 2002 to promote their remastered back-catalogue during the \"Seven-year itch\" tour.\n\nAlso, React365 is a prank website where users can submit their own headline, description and photo to create realistic looking prank news articles. As with all stories on the site, this one also carried a disclaimer at the very end of the page which read:\n\nUsers don't even need to upload their own image, there is a built-in search function that will pull an appropriate image from Google image search.\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of prank sites all using the same basic layout but sometimes in different languages. It appears to be run by a Belgian company named Mediavibes or Media Vibes which is managed by a man named Nicolas Gouriou according to registration records.\n\nSo don't fall for this prank now that we've warned you about it! And that includes copies of it on other websites because this often happens when spoof news articles go viral. Always check the original source before sharing incredible news.", "lang": "en"}
