The World Anti-Doping Agency, the 17-year-old regulator of drugs in sports, traced the hacking to the Russian military intelligence agency. The anti-doping agency found that some of the documents published by the hacking group appeared to have been altered.\n\nThe initial release of the records of athletes were largely of Americans - including gold medal gymnast Simone Biles and tennis player Venus Williams. The Fancy Bears\u2019 website alleges that the American athletes\u2019 medical records \u201ctell you about the U.S. Olympic team and their dirty methods to win.\u201d\n\nUSA Gymnastics said that Biles, who won four gold medals in Rio, \"was approved for a therapeutic-use exemption\" of certain drugs and \"has not broken any drug-testing regulations, \"including at the Olympic Games in Rio.\" None of the athletes named in the hacker\u2019s data have been implicated in wrong doing according to international Olympic officials, even after the release of the confidential records.\n\nThe United States Anti-Doping Agency strongly condemned the attempt to smear the reputations of the U.S. athletes. \"The cyberbullying of innocent athletes being engaged by these hackers is cowardly and despicable,\" said chief executive Travis Tygart.\n\nOn September 16, the International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach slammed the release of the athlete\u2019s medical records calling it \u201can unacceptable and outrageous breach of medical confidentiality that attempts to smear innocent athletes who have not committed any doping offense.\"\n\nThen on October 7, the International Olympic Committee announced that the World Anti-Doping Agency will be the new drug testing authority, highlighting the agency's key role in policing the use of performance enhancing substances in cheating scandals.\n\nRussian officials continue to deny involvement in the hacking of the Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s records and have offered assistance to the agency in its investigation into the intrusion.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s international media outlets used the leaked information in an attempt to discredit the Anti-Doping Agency, saying the data shows the agency treated Russian athletes different from Americans.\n\nBut none of the Russian government accounts provide proof refuting the Agency\u2019s claim that the breach into its database is linked directly to Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency.", "lang": "en"}
