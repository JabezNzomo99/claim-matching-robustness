Fact: The image in the post is the visualization of a proposed residential-cum-commercial building by Vincent Callebaut Architectures in Brussels (Belgium). It is no way connected to Ambedkar. \u2018Jai Bhim\u2019 was added on the building by editing the picture. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search, it is found that the building is a visualization by an architecture company, Vincent Callebaut Architectures. The visualization was for a project proposed in Brussels (Belgium). The building is not a library but a residential-cum-commercial building.\n\nAlso, in the original visualization, there is no \u2018Jai Bhim\u2019 poster on the building. It was added in the posted image by editing the original visualization.\n\nTo sum it up, visualization of a project in Brussels is being falsely claimed as Ambedkar Library building in the U.S.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
