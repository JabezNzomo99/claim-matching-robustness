On July 5, the website Canada Eh? published an article with the headline, \u201cCanadians Can Be Fined $1,500 If Their Passager [sic] is Using a Mobile Phone.\u201d The post reported:\n\nDistracted driving causes more deaths in Canada than impaired driving. It\u2019s why every province and territory has laws against driving while operating a cell phone. \u201cTell your passengers to stay off their phones while you are driving.\u201d You can get fined in Canada 1,500 even if your passenger is using mobile phone, starting next week. \u201cMobile phones, even when held by a passenger, can be a dangerous distraction for the driver.\u201d Starting mext [sic] week being distracted by a screen held by a passenger attracts a penalty of $1,500 and three demerit points.\n\nWe checked legislation on distracted driving in every Canadian province and territory: British Columbia; Alberta; Saskatchewan; Manitoba; Ontario; Qu\u00e9bec; New Brunswick; Nova Scotia; Prince Edward Island; Newfoundland and Labrador; Yukon; the Northwest Territories; and Nunavut.\n\nEach law prohibits distracted driving in general and the use by motorists of cellphones and other hand-held devices in particular, but none of them holds drivers culpable or liable for the use of a cellphone by one of their passengers.\n\nA spokesperson for Transport Canada, the national government department that helps to coordinate and oversee regional traffic safety policies, confirmed for Snopes that the department was not aware of any plans currently underway to introduce a new offense and $1,500 fine for drivers whose passengers are caught using cellphones. The blog post\u2019s key claim was therefore false.\n\nCanada Eh? has a penchant for publishing attention-grabbing and misleading articles about life in Canada. In June 2019, the website falsely claimed that a crackdown on cannabis use and public drinking was imminent \u201cin every province,\u201d and earlier that year Canada Eh? published an inaccurate and partially plagiarized article about boil water notices throughout the country.\n\nPlagiarism again played a role in the July 2020 post about distracted driving. Elements of the article were copied and pasted from a January 2020 Daily Mail report about distracted driving in Australia, another blog post about fines in Australia, and a 2018 blog post about distracted driving laws in Canada.", "lang": "en"}
