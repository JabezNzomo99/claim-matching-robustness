No, that's not true: the screenshot of the tweet circulating on social media is fake, Trump did not send the tweet.\n\nAn example of the screenshot can be seen in a post (archived here), where it was published by the Facebook page '25th For Trump' on Monday, June 1, 2020. The post was captioned, \"WTF,\" and the text in the fake tweet read: \n\n\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThe fake tweet bore the timestamp 11:36 AM 5/31/20.\n\nLead Stories checked President Trump's twitter account and found no mention of the phrase \"food/supplies\" (archived here). We also checked ProPublica's Politwoops (\"Politwoops tracks deleted tweets by public officials, including people currently in office and candidates for office.\") to make sure this wasn't a deleted tweet and no results showed up there either (archived here).\n\nWe also found no trace of the Trump Twitter archive for \"food/supplies.\"\n\nThe Secret Service did briefly move President Trump and his family to an underground bunker because of security concerns as protesters rallied outside the White House on Friday night, May 29, 2020, CNN reported.", "lang": "en"}
