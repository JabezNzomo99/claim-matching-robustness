And I\u2019ve talked to you about some of the innovations that we\u2019re doing, some of the things that we\u2019re doing to be proactive. But I\u2019m doing that at 1985 staffing levels. So, you think about that. That\u2019s leadership. That\u2019s experience. I\u2019m doing more with less in a county that\u2019s grown 46 percent, where law enforcement\u2019s grown 103 percent. We are moving forward.\"\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the population of Dane County, home to Madison, has been growing and that court caseloads would be higher, as well.\n\nSo, is the DA\u2019s office there still operating with the same number of staff it did nearly three decades ago?\n\nIn Wisconsin, the elected district attorneys and the prosecutors they hire primarily prosecute felony and misdemeanor crimes, as well juvenile cases, in circuit court. They were county employees until 1990, after a change in state law made them state employees. The change was made largely as a means of providing local property tax relief and reducing turnover in prosecutor positions, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\n\nAs a result, the vast majority of prosecutor positions in the district attorney offices is determined through the state budget process. Some county district attorney offices also get prosecutors via state- or federally funded grants, which come and go.\n\nConcerns have been raised for years about the number of prosecutors. A state Legislative Audit Bureau done in 2007 noted that the state employed 425 district attorney prosecutors but -- based on the number and types of cases prosecuted as analyzed by the State Prosecutors Office -- should employ 542.\n\nThat gap has grown, according to a more recent analysis. The State Prosecutors Office says there were still 425 district attorney prosecutors as of April 2014, but there should be 555.\n\nAs for Ozanne\u2019s claim, he said he was referring to the prosecutor positions in his office.\n\nTo back the claim, his campaign initially cited on the website of the Dane County district attorney's office, which lists the number of prosecutors annually back from 1985 through 2011.\n\nSeparately, we obtained a from the county\u2019s budget office.\n\nBoth indicate the Dane County DA\u2019s office had 26 prosecutors in 1985.\n\nThe number remained in the high 20s to low 30s well into the 1990s before peaking at 34 in both 1999 and 2003, according to the chart. The low was 25 prosecutors in 2010.\n\nThe current number, however, is slightly higher than the 26 that there were in 1985.\n\nThe full-time-equivalent number of prosecutor positions for 2014 is 27.85, according to the State Prosecutors Office.\n\nThat is nearly two positions, or about 7 percent, more than Dane County\u2019s 1985 total.\n\nBy comparison, Milwaukee County had 86 prosecutors in 1990 (the oldest complete data available) compared to 119.5 in 2014, according to the State Prosecutors Office.\n\nBut two other important factors bear on Ozanne\u2019s claim.\n\n1. The Dane County DA's office has used more state-paid special prosecutors than any other county in each year since 2012 (Ozanne became DA in August 2010), according to the State Prosecutors Office.\n\nSo far in 2014, it has used six special prosecutors, including two who are covering extended leaves; that would technically bump its total to 29.85 prosecutors for 2014, as indicated on information Ozanne\u2019s campaign provided. The state incurs an additional cost to pay the special prosecutors, even though they are not a net addition to the prosecutorial staff.\n\n2. Ozanne\u2019s claim was general -- the level of staffing in his office, rather than specifically the number of prosecutors. We found there are currently in the DA\u2019s office -- paralegals, investigators, secretaries and others -- which is 41 percent more than the 41 support staff in 1985.\n\nOzanne said: \"I\u2019m running the second-largest county district attorney\u2019s office \u2026 at 1985 staffing levels.\"\n\nThe Dane County district attorney\u2019s office has a full-time-equivalent of 27.85 prosecutors, just slightly more than the 26 in 1985, but it also regularly utilizes special prosecutors to fill temporary vacancies. And the office has 41 percent more support staff than it did in 1985.", "lang": "en"}
