No, the entire story is not true: it was made up by a Canadian website that invents tales of bizarre crimes and weird sex acts for entertainment purposes. None of it is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on September 23, 2018 titled \"Choir boy survives deadly snake bite after priest sucks venom out of genitals\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nMiami, FL | A priest at a southwest Miami-Dade County Catholic church has possibly saved a young choir boy's life after he was bitten by a rattlesnake. Father Juan Cristobal Jos\u00e9 Gonzalez, the pastor at St. Francis Catholic Church, had taken the 15-year-old boy out for a two-day fishing and camping trip when the incident occurred. The young boy was bitten near the testicles moments after he walked on what he believed to be a branch and Father Gonzalez immediately attempted to suck out the venom before bringing him to the hospital.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nAccording to this archive.org webpage capture the image used to illustrate the story has been online since at least 2010:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
