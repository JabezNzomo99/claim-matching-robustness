While the U.S. has imposed sanctions affecting individuals connected to the Russian annexation of Crimea, as well as sanctions on doing business in occupied Crimea, the image of the visa application is fake.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that there is no question relating to Russia\u2019s attempted annexation of Crimea on any U.S. visa application,\u201d a U.S. State Department official wrote to Polygraph.info.\n\nThe U.S. State Department also warns U.S. citizens not to travel to occupied Crimea, and U.S. officials are forbidden from visiting the peninsula.", "lang": "en"}
