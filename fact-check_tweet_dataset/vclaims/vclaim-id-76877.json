In 2006, the Granite State was 6th.\n\n \n\n \"New Hampshire\u2019s economic competitiveness was dragged down in the rankings by its worst in the nation corporate tax policy,\" according to the article.\n\n \n\n \"The rate is fairly high,\" Drenkard said. \"That's part of the component there. There's a business profits tax and New Hampshire limits carryforwards, one of the things that's an important part of the base.\"\n\n \n\n New Hampshire also got \"dinged\" in 2010 for offering credits for creating jobs, as well as research and development credits and investment credits, which The Tax Foundation scores as negative in its corporate tax policy, Drenkard added.\n\n \n\n \"Those, for the most part, mixed with the high rate, ended up putting it in 50th in 2010,\" Drenkard said. \"In general, the spirit of what he\u2019s trying to say is certainly true. We rank it as one of the worst corporate tax structures in the country.\"\n\n \n\n State legislatures write the laws that impact tax structure, Drenkard said. But it\u2019s important to note that in 2012 -- under a Republican-controlled legislature -- the Granite State only hits 46th in its corporate tax rank compared to the rest of the country.\n\n \n\n Each Tax Foundation study is considered exclusive to the year in which it is conducted and should not be compared with previous ranks, Drenkard said.\n\n \n\n \"For the most part, I don\u2019t remember hearing any fantastic corporate tax reforms from New Hampshire at least recently,\" Drenkard said. \"So the story is it was bad in 2010 and for the most part is still one of our lowest ranked corporate tax codes.\"\n\n \n\n As for the Granite State\u2019s unemployment statistics, O\u2019Brien is fairly accurate on the numbers by themselves.\n\n \n\n \"Roughly, you could say it doubled,\" Annette Nielsen, an economist for New Hampshire Employment Security said.\n\n \n\n Looking at 2006 generally -- four years prior to Republicans taking over the state legislature in November 2010 -- unemployment was in the 3.4-3.7 percent range, Nielsen said.\n\n \n\n It stayed that way through May 2008, she added. In November and December that year, the recession hit, and state unemployment numbers started rising. By December 2008 the unemployment was 4.8 percent. By October 2009 it peaked at 6.7 percent and stayed that way through January 2010. Not quite the \"more than doubled\" number O\u2019Brien cited, but close.\n\n \n\n New Hampshire\u2019s increasing unemployment rate followed nationwide trends, Nielsen said.\n\n \n\n \"The nation was at a much higher rate, it peaked in October at 10.1 or 10.2 percent,\" Nielsen said. \"It followed the general trend of the nation.\"\n\n \n\n Are Democrats to blame for the increased unemployment figures?\n\n \n\n \"Whether it could be better or worse, that's kind of a little more individual -- what people maybe feel,\" Nielsen said. \"There are some forces that are national that have an impact. New Hampshire is not an island by itself. It\u2019s part of the nation and there were some greater forces that were taking place at that time.\"\n\n \n\n Dennis Delay, an economist with the N.H. Center for Public Policy Studies, an independent nonprofit that pursues data-based research on public policy matters, agreed.\n\n \n\n Unemployment increased in New Hampshire as a result of the Great Recession, he said.\n\n \n\n \"States with Republican legislatures also saw unemployment rates rise substantially after 2007, because of the worldwide financial crisis and its impact on local economies,\" Delay added.\n\n \n\n He provided a graph of job losses in the U.S. and compared it to New Hampshire, which shows the spike in job losses nationwide during that period of time.\n\n \n\n \"The situation in New Hampshire looks similar, although New Hampshire did not lose as many jobs in percentage terms as the U.S.,\" Delay added.\n\n \n\n Our ruling:\n\n \n\n O\u2019Brien said that when Republicans took over the state legislature in 2010, the state's tax rate for employers was last in the nation, and unemployment had more than doubled under Democrats.\n\n \n\n We find he generalized a 2010 tax study, zeroing in on New Hampshire\u2019s corporate tax rate, when several other factors contribute to The Tax Foundation\u2019s corporate tax index for New Hampshire. And he failed to mention that New Hampshire\u2019s corporate tax rank is still in the same ballpark in 2012.\n\n \n\n O\u2019Brien used accurate unemployment figures comparing 2006 to 2010, but the numbers have more to do with the Great Recession than with the people (or the party) running the state.\n\n \n\n O\u2019Brien was on target with the rank and rates he cited, but there is context missing and misplaced blame.
