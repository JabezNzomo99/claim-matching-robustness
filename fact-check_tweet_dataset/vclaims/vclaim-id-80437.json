Twittersphere has been divided whether it was right or not.\n\nSeveral right-wing Twitter handles shared the image on Wednesday taking a dig at the Congress party and Indian liberals who have expressed their outrage. Below is a tweet by Gaurav Pradhan, who has been caught by BOOM and other factcheckers, in the past for his dubious tweets. (See here and here). The tweets also included Prafulla Ketkar, Editor of Organiser, the official mouthpiece of the RSS.\n\nBOOM did a Google Reverse Image Search, and found that the picture dates back to August, 2013.\n\nWe also found an e-paper link of Deccan Chronicle from August 1, 2013 which reported that bronze statues of Rajiv Gandhi and Indira Gandhi were vandalised, toppled and torched in Anantapur. The state of Andhra Pradesh was gripped by large scale rioting and violence after the ruling-Congress party accepted the demand to carve out a separate state of Telangana. The Congress Working Committee announced its decision on Telangana on July 30, 2013 sparking violent protests by United Andhra Pradesh activists that targeted symbols of the Congress party.\n\nThe photograph also features among Deccan Chronicles' wrap up of its most iconic photos of 2013.
