The coin referenced is being sold by the White House Gift Shop, which is a private company based in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nUpdate, Oct. 5: In early October, after Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19, the White House Gift Shop began selling a coin titled, \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump Defeats COVID.\u201d Confusion over the shop\u2019s name prompted false claims that the administration was selling the coin.\n\nThe White House is not selling coins related to the novel coronavirus pandemic, as some on social media have wrongly suggested.\n\nBut a COVID-19 themed coin is being sold by the White House Gift Shop \u2014 a private business that is not part of the federal government, although its origins decades ago are tied to the White House.\n\nThe company garnered attention when it began offering the coin for $125 (though it\u2019s currently on sale for $100) as part of its \u201cHistoric Moments in History Series.\u201d\n\n\u201cWORLD vs VIRUS,\u201d reads a mock-up with a novel coronavirus graphic. \u201cTogether We FOUGHT The UNSEEN Enemy. The back shows a White House lectern and celebrates the \u201cCOVID-19 Task Force\u201d and includes President Donald Trump\u2019s name, as well as those of Vice President Mike Pence and other members of the White House coronavirus task force.\n\nThe company says it will donate proceeds from the coin to COVID-19 medical research.\n\nHeadlines about the coin began circulating on social media on April 29, causing confusion by virtue of the company\u2019s name \u2014 and prompting posts of outrage on left-leaning accounts.\n\nOn Twitter and Facebook, Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 official Senate accounts suggested the coin was a product of the White House while sharing a link to a Daily Beast story (which does indicate that the company is privately run).\n\n\u201cIf the White House Gift Shop is going to produce $100 COVID-19 coins, Trump can sure as hell utilize the Defense Production Act to manufacture the gloves, gowns, and masks our medical workers desperately need,\u201d the Sanders posts said.\n\nThe Occupy Democrats Facebook group also shared the Daily Beast story and misleadingly wrote, \u201cWHAT IS WRONG WITH TRUMP? Who would want these?\u201d\n\nOther headlines also falsely indicated the coin was coming from the actual White House, or that Trump somehow stood to profit from it.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s New Idea To Profit: \u2018$100 COVID-19 Commemorative Coins,'\u201d read one from dailyboulder.com. Politicalflare.com asserted: \u201cWhite House Sells COVID-19 Commemorative Coins That Celebrate the \u2018Genius Level Thinking\u2019 of Trump.\u201d (That website later updated its story and apologized.)\n\nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office records show that the White House Gift Shop and White House Gift Shop, Est. 1946 are trademarks owned by Giannini Strategic Enterprises, a limited liability corporation formed in 2010 in Lititz, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2018, when the company sold a coin celebrating the meeting between Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un, the website Talking Points Memo published a report looking into the history of the shop. It pointed to documents filed in connection with the trademark applications showing that the company\u2019s current CEO, Anthony Giannini, officially acquired the operation in 2013 from the now-defunct United States Secret Service Uniformed Division Benefit Fund.\n\nAn archived version of the shop\u2019s website from May 2000 describes the fund\u2019s origins as dating back to 1946, with the start of the White House Police Benefit Fund. That fund provided flowers for officers who \u201chad a death in their immediate family\u201d and offered \u201cretiring members a departing gift from the force.\u201d The effort expanded, however, following the 1950 killing of a White House police officer during an assassination attempt on President Harry Truman.\n\nIn the years that followed, the website\u2019s history noted, the Uniformed Division Benefit Fund was formed and revenue was \u201cgenerated through the sale of various commemorative items.\u201d Its gift shop operated in the Old Executive Office Building, and later moved to a nearby space to make it publicly accessible. The Uniformed Division Benefit Fund filed for bankruptcy in 2013.\n\nThe gift shop now operates online and no longer has a physical space in Washington, D.C. The company today says it \u201ccontinues to actively support Law Enforcement Departments or Agencies by funding special advanced firearms training and by purchasing safe and effective arms for departments often in smaller jurisdictions with limited advanced training budgets.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to the company but didn\u2019t hear back. But Giannini, the CEO, also confirmed to the fact-checking website Snopes that the business \u201cis not affiliated with The White House, nor is The White House involved in any of our decisions, products, or operations.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
