No, that's not true: the video is real but it does not show Macron.\n\nThe claim appeared in a tweet published on December 3, 2018 by someone named \"Cossack\" on Twitter (archived here, video archived here) which read:\n\nAccording to local media reports the firemen did indeed turn their backs during a ceremony on December 2, 2018 in Cholet for the feast of Saint Barbara (patron saint of firemen and others in jobs involving fire and explosions):\n\nMacron was not present during the ceremony. The man in the sash is Denis Mass\u00e9glia, a member of the French parliament (Assembl\u00e9e nationale) elected for Macron's party \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\" (LREM).\n\nFrom the slogan on the banner unfurled by the firemen it appears they are protesting budget cuts, not the government or president in general.", "lang": "en"}
