The Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support (CARES) Act was signed into law Monday. The bill provides funding for autism programs and research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Health Resources and Services Administration.\n\n\u201cThe bill, which reauthorizes the previous Autism CARES Act of 2014, expands government programs to include older people with autism \u2018who were \u2014 and are\u2013 often misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed and overlooked,\u2019 according to Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nThose reports were accurate. On Sept. 30, Trump did indeed sign into law H.R. 1058, the Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support Act of 2019, as the Congressional Record shows. The \u201cAutism CARES Act\u201d became law on that date.\n\nThe legislation, which was authored by U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., commits to spending $369.7 million every fiscal year between 2020 and 2024 \u2014 a total of $1.85 billion over five years. As such, the news articles were also highly accurate in reporting that the bill Trump signed allocates $1.8 billion. In fact, the total is slightly higher.\n\nThat funding commitment represents a 42 percent increase on the $1.3 billion that Congress allocated for 2015-2019, in the 2014 Autism CARES Act.\n\nThe bill had sponsors from both parties and received wide bipartisan support in both houses. It was passed without need for a roll-call vote in the House on July 24 and in the Senate on Sept. 19.\n\nThe bill essentially reauthorized the Autism CARES Act of 2014, which had been sponsored by Smith in the House, and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., in the Senate. It provided funding for the disbursement of grants to researchers, as well as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) programs and centers across the country.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 8, 2014.\n\nThe 2019 bill added new provisions whereby the Director of the National Institutes of Health could prioritize funding for research, programs and services in \u201crural or underserved areas,\u201d and take into account the extent to which an applicant served \u201cyouth and adults from diverse racial, ethnic, geographic, or linguistic backgrounds.\u201d\n\nIn the past, President Trump has repeatedly promoted the long-debunked theory that vaccinations cause autism, but his position may have shifted somewhat. Earlier in 2019, he urged parents to vaccinate their children against measles, in the midst of an outbreak of the disease.", "lang": "en"}
