This is false, and while the article in question was written as satire, not everyone seems to have realised this, with some Facebook users commenting on the story as though it was real.\n\nA screenshot of the article headline, which crops out any indication that the story is satire, has also been shared.\n\nThe story was originally published on the Patheos website in January. Patheos says its aim is to \u201cexplore the world\u2019s faith through different perspectives on religion and spirituality\u201d, and has a section on its website called \u201cLaughing in Disbelief\u201d.\n\nThe writer of the stories in \u201cLaughing in Disbelief\u201d and of this particular article, Andrew Hall, has confirmed all articles posted in this section are satirical. This is where the story about Iceland was published. A tag at the bottom of the article says \u201cSatire\u201d.Even without knowing that the article was intended as satire, there are other clues that the story is not factual.\n\nIt includes a quote from Iceland\u2019s Prime Minister Andrew Kanard. Since November 2017, the Prime Minister of Iceland has been Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir. There has never been any Icelandic Prime Minister by the name Andrew Kanard.\n\nThe government of Iceland\u2019s website states the Evangelical Lutheran Church is the state church and \u201cshall be supported and protected by the state\u201d.\n\nAs well as saying Iceland has declared all religions to be mental disorders, the Patheos story claims Iceland has mandated mental health warnings on all Bibles and banned American televangelists. This links to two other articles published on \u201cLaughing in Disbelief\u201d in 2017 which, as explained above, are also satirical.\n\nIt also links to another article on the same section listing all religious practices banned by Iceland. This is also satire.", "lang": "en"}
