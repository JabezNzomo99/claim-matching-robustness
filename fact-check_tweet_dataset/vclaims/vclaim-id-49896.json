{"title": "Did the Merriam-Webster Dictionary Just Recognize 'Irregardless' as a Word?", "subtitle": "This long-used word has been the bane of many a pedant.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-07-09T16:24:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-49896", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/irregardless-merriam-webster/", "vclaim": "However, the definition for \"irregardless\" has been included in Merriam-Webster's Unabridged edition since 1934.\n\nIn early July 2020, social media users asked Snopes.com to verify whether it was true that the Merriam-Webster dictionary had newly recognized \u201cirregardless\u201d as a word in the English language.\n\n\u201cIrregardless\u201d has long been stigmatized as a non-word that has the opposite meaning of its intended use. So when rumor spread that \u201cirregardless\u201d had been newly enshrined on the pages of Merriam-Webster dictionaries, it prompted some readers to post in jest that 2020, the year marked by the coronavirus pandemic, had just gotten worse:\n\nIt\u2019s true that on July 3, Merriam-Webster included the word \u201cirregardless\u201d in its \u201cWord of the Week\u201d roundup, apparently prompted by a Twitter user declaring the English language to be \u201cdead\u201d:\n\nDespite gaining new notoriety online, the word isn\u2019t a recent dictionary addition. A Merriam-Webster spokesperson told NPR that \u201cirregardless\u201d has appeared in the pages of its Unabridged dictionary edition since 1934, and, as NPR reported, other dictionaries \u2014 including \u201cWebster\u2019s New World College Dictionary, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language and the Cambridge Dictionary \u2014 all recognize irregardless as a word\u201d:\n\nIn its July 3 Words of the Week post, Merriam-Webster poked some fun at the internet outrage over \u201cirregardless\u201d:\n\nFrom time to time it is drawn to our attention that certain parties find it objectionable that we have included irregardless in our dictionary. The outrage presumably springs from our allowing this callow arriviste to rub elbows with other, nobler, words; the very presence of irregardless besmirches such entries as asshead, ninnyhammer, and schnook.\n\nBut \u201cirregardless\u201d has been in \u201cwidespread and near-constant\u201d use since 1795, along with other commonly used words such as \u201ccitizenry\u201d and \u201cterrorism.\u201d Merriam-Webster categorizes the word \u201cirregardless\u201d as \u201cnonstandard,\u201d meaning, \u201cnot conforming in pronunciation, grammatical construction, idiom, or word choice to the usage generally characteristic of educated native speakers of a language.\u201d The word is probably derived from a \u201cblend of irrespective and regardless.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cirregardless\u201d is defined simply as \u201cregardless,\u201d according to its definition in the dictionary.", "lang": "en"}
