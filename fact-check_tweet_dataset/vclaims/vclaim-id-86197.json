We don\u2019t fact check opinions, no matter how unusual, but Palin\u2019s remarks do reflect some common misunderstanding about foreign holdings of Treasury securities. So let\u2019s take a deeper look.\n\nFirst of all, we should note that Palin is not the first politician to highlight borrowing from China. Here\u2019s a youthful looking Barack Obama in 2008, complaining that \u201cthe way [President] Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children\u2026. That\u2019s irresponsible. It\u2019s unpatriotic.\u201d\n\nYes, China is a biggest single holder of Treasury debt, owning $1.268 trillion as of August of this year, but that amounts to only about 10 percent of all U.S. debt held by the public, which was nearly $12 trillion at the end of August. Moreover, Japan is close behind China, holding $1.149 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities, and yet for some reason its holdings generate much less attention.\n\nThe chart below, which originally appeared on The Washington Post\u2019s WorldViews blog, illustrates the distribution of holdings well. Foreign holdings of U.S. debt actually amount to less than 50 percent of the total U.S. debt, but as a percentage of privately held debt, foreign holdings amount to about 56 percent. (That\u2019s because about $2 trillion in publicly traded debt is held by Federal Reserve banks.)\n\nBut there is a further wrinkle. Nearly 30 percent of the debt held overseas is not held by governments, but private investors, according to the Treasury Department. Put another way, about 39 percent of privately held debt \u2014 and 33 percent of all publicly traded debt \u2014 is held by foreign governments. So that makes the \u201cforeign master,\u201d as Palin put it, a bit less baleful.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service earlier this year wrote an interesting report on foreign holdings of federal debt, which we have embedded below for readers who want to know more. But the key point it makes is that the rising debt itself is the biggest risk to the long-term health of the U.S. economy, not necessarily the fact that foreign governments may own a portion of that debt.\n\nThe fact that U.S. Treasury debt is in such demand in many ways is a vote of confidence in the United States during a period of economic turmoil, as U.S. Treasuries have generally been regarded as among the safest investments. The report also notes that there is little the United States could do to prevent foreigners from buying U.S. securities, as they are traded on secondary markets.\n\nThe bottom line: \u201cEconomically, the only way government could reduce its reliance on foreign borrowing is by raising the U.S. saving rate, which could be done most directly by reducing budget deficits.\u201d\n\nThe key issue is rising federal debt, especially if debt is used to facilitate consumption (such as programs for the elderly) rather than make capital investments. It is possible that future generations will be richer and more productive, and thus able to afford the bill, but it largely depends on how big the economy is at the time \u2014 not necessarily who is holding Treasury bonds.\n\nPoliticians should speak accurately about foreign holdings of the national debt, rather than so simplistically \u2014 especially when using slavery analogies. We can\u2019t quite declare this worthy of Four Pinocchios, because China is the largest overseas holder of Treasury securities, but it is close.", "lang": "en"}
