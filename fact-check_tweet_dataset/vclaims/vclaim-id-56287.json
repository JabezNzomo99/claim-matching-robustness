Hundreds of KKK members attended as delegates, according to JSTOR Daily.\n\nThe image of KKK members gathered around a burning cross has been misidentified by multiple Facebook users. It does not show KKK members at the 1924 Democratic National Convention, despite what the text overlaying the photo claims.

The photo, from the Chicago Tribune archives, depicts a KKK gathering roughly three years before the convention, according to its caption.\n\n\u201cThousands of Klansmen gather in August 1921 for an initiation ceremony on a farm near Lake Zurich owned by Charles Weeghman, who had owned the Chicago Cubs,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cThe procession there began in Chicago\u2019s Albany Park neighborhood.\u201d\n\nSocial media users have deployed other images of the KKK in an attempt to discredit Democrats. In June 2019, a photo of Klansmen en route to the funeral of a slain police officer was miscaptioned to make it seem like it was taken at the 1924 Democratic National Convention.", "lang": "en"}
