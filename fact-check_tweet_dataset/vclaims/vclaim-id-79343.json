Rittenhouse, 17, was captured in video footage carrying a military-style rifle, marching alongside members of the latter group, and putting his hands up after shots were fired. Authorities arrested him on Aug. 26 in connection with the deaths in Antioch, Illinois, where he was being held without bail and awaiting his next court hearing on Sept. 25.\n\nThe charges against Rittenhouse included first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a life sentence. The Chicago Tribune reported:\n\nThat brings us to the question from Snopes readers: Was a website that brands itself as Christian called GiveSendGo hosting an apparent online fundraiser to help Rittenhouse pay court costs?\n\nFirst, we searched several crowdfunding sites for online campaigns with a similar stated goal: to raise money to help Rittenhouse or his family fight criminal charges against him. None appeared on GoFundMe, as of this report.\n\nSeveral crowdfunding pages, however, were active and allegedly supporting Rittenhouse\u2019s case on Fundly (see partial search results below). Additionally, a conservative student group at Arizona State University pledged to donate half of its future fundraising dollars to the cause. \u201c[Rittenhouse] does not deserve to have his entire life destroyed because of the actions of violent anarchists during a lawless riot,\u201d the college group tweeted.\n\nNext, we considered crowdfunding platforms that describe themselves as Christian and researched GiveSendGo at readers\u2019 requests. According to the website, which describes itself as the \u201c#1 Free Christian Crowdfunding Site,\u201d users can organize and run crowdsourcing campaigns for free by using personalized logins and donate to GiveSendGo directly. The website\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page stated:\n\nBased on that evidence, it was accurate to claim GiveSendGo describes itself as a website that promotes Christianity.\n\nThen we looked for proof of pages supporting Rittenhouse on the platform. A keyword search for \u201cKyle Rittenhouse\u201d uncovered several pages, including a fundraiser titled \u201cRaise Money For Kyle Rittenhouse Legal Defense\u201d that had raised more than $314,000 as of this report.\n\nIt was the most popular and active GiveSendGo campaign created to supposedly help the teen or his family. The page included the following the description:\n\nKyle Rittenhouse just defended himself from a brutal attack by multiple members of the far-leftist group ANTIFA \u2013 the experience was undoubtedly a brutal one, as he was forced to take two lives to defend his own. Now, Kyle is being unfairly charged with murder 1, by a DA who seems determined only to capitalize on the political angle of the situation. The situation was clearly self-defense, and Kyle and his family will undoubtedly need money to pay for the legal fees. Let\u2019s give back to someone who bravely tried to defend his community.\n\nOn Aug. 28, 2020, the page\u2019s organizers \u2014 \u201cFriends of the Rittenhouse family\u201d of Atlanta, Georgia \u2014 wrote an update to the page in which they claimed they had spoken with Rittenhouse\u2019s mother and legal team and that that party was raising money via multiple methods. The organizers of the GiveSendGo campaign pledged: \u201cAll of the money donated \u2026 will go to Kyle\u2019s defense, as it is likely to be an expensive and protracted affair.\u201d\n\nNo specific details on the GiveSendGo page\u2019s organizers were known, including how or under what circumstances they started the alleged fundraiser. Anyone can establish a campaign on the site; donors are encouraged to report pages that appear suspicious or fraudulent, and there was no evidence to confirm or deny the organizers of the campaign for Rittenhouse were indeed giving the payments to help his legal defense, aside from the above-described pledge from them. That update also read:\n\nThe GiveSendGo page collected more than 7,330 donations as of this report, some of which included messages of support for Rittenhouse. \u201cThis young man is a hero. Give him a medal and make him a millionaire. Every patriot can spare him a few bucks\u201d said an anonymous donor who contributed $10, per the page. Another donor said:\n\nBased on those findings \u2014 yes, a self-described Christian crowdfunding website GiveSendGo was hosting a campaign to supposedly help Rittenhouse \u2014 we reached out to the website\u2019s administrators to learn under what terms it hosts campaigns on its platform. Jacob Wells, a co-founder of the site, told us via email:\n\nGiveSendGo allows campaigns from all kinds of different people and political/religious ideologies. Just because we are Christians does not mean every campaign on our site has to be one or that we agree with its campaign premise. [\u2026] We will withhold judgement and leave that for the courts and God. Our judicial system works on the principle of innocence until proven guilty. As a veteran owned platform we recognize the freedoms we have in the USA came at a very high price and we will not just trample on them to satisfy political correctness.\n\nAdditionally, he said site administrators were conducting a review of the page involving Rittenhouse to make sure it follows site guidelines, though they \u201ccurrently believe the campaign is eligible like any other campaigns because it does not violate our terms of service.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 27 the crowdfunding site posted the following statement to Twitter:\n\n\n\nThe campaign stoked controversy online among people who believed it wrongfully celebrated the actions of an alleged killer and should be removed from the crowdfunding website. Referring to Blake, who was paralyzed from the waist down after a white police officer shot at his back multiple times on Aug. 23, one Facebook user alleged:\n\nIn response to those critics, Wells told Snopes:\n\nIn sum, given how GiveSendGo describes itself \u2014 the \u201c#1 Free Christian Crowdfunding Site\u201d \u2014 as well as evidence of listed donations on a webpage that says it will give all contributions to help fund Rittenhouse\u2019s legal defense, we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
