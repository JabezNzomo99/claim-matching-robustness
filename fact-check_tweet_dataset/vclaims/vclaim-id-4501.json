In its headline, it claims that the measles vaccine has killed more people than measles infections, and that data from the CDC proves this. The CDC data it cites is from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database. A search of the database for all deaths reported after measles vaccination, including single and combination vaccines, from 1990 (when the database was established) to May 2019 turned up 90 cases, and not 108 as reported in the article.\n\nBut one of the biggest caveats to using VAERS data is that a report can be made even without proof that the vaccine caused the adverse event, meaning that no causal relationship is established by adverse event reports. This is made clear in the VAERS database: \u201cA major limitation of VAERS data is that VAERS cannot determine if the adverse health event reported was caused by the vaccination.\n\nOn the other hand, the World Health Organization has estimated millions of deaths from measles infection every year before the measles vaccine was introduced: \u201cBefore the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every 2\u20133 years and measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year.\u201d If we account only for the United States, CDC data shows that approximately 500 deaths were recorded yearly before the vaccine was introduced.\n\nWhile the United States has not seen measles deaths in a decade, the danger of measles infection is shown in developing countries like Madagascar and the Philippines, which are currently dealing with measles outbreaks and where access to medical care is comparatively limited. In these latest outbreaks, Madagascar has seen more than 1,200 deaths from measles, while the Philippines has recorded more than 400 deaths.\n\nThe article misleadingly uses measles mortality to support its statement that the measles vaccine is not necessary for preventing measles-related deaths. As Dr. David Gorski points out in his article on Science-Based Medicine, a more appropriate comparison would use a graph of measles incidence (since the measles vaccine\u2019s purpose is to prevent a person catching the infection in the first place) \u2013 CDC data below shows a clear decline after 1963 when the measles vaccine was introduced (source of graph).\n\nWhile the article is correct in saying that a natural measles infection generally provides lifelong immunity to the measles virus, it fails to take into account the well-documented fact that measles infection also leads to immunosuppression. This compromises a person\u2019s ability to defend against other pathogens[1,2,3]. In short, the individual is now protected from measles but more vulnerable to every other forms of infection.\n\nIn a review, Griffin writes: \u201cIn most individuals, this immune response is successful both in clearing infection from the multiple sites of virus replication and in establishing life-long immunity to re-infection. However, infection is also associated with several weeks of immune suppression with the consequence that the primary causes of measles deaths are secondary infections.\u201d[1]\n\nThis article has been reviewed for accuracy by the immunologist Professor Ian Frazer of the Diamantina Institute at the University of Queensland.\n\u2022 3 \u2013 Gadroen et al.
