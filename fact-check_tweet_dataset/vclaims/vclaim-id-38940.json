This claim is misleading; health experts say there is insufficient evidence that drinking water at specified times during the day can have additional health benefits to staying hydrated.\n\nThe graphic was published here on Twitter on February 15, 2020. It has been retweeted almost 10,000 since.\n\nThe post advises that drinking water \u201cafter waking up\u201d, \u201c30 min before a meal\u201d, \u201cbefore taking a shower\u201d and \u201cbefore going to bed\u201d each have differing health benefits, from \"helps activate internal organs\u201d to \u201chelps to avoid heart attack\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe graphic has also been shared alongside similar claims hundreds of times on Facebook here and here.\n\n\u201cThere is no clinical trial to support these claims,\" Dr. Nannette Rey, a board member of the Philippine Heart Association, told AFP in an email on February 27, 2020.\n\nSuch claims \u201care actually derived from known benefits of water and just extrapolated and passed on as clinical recommendations, when in fact the only recommendation is just to drink enough fluids,\" Rey said. \u201cWhat is recommended is to keep yourself hydrated the whole day for vital body function.\"\n\nDr. Ranulfo Javelosa Jr., the Chief of the Preventive Cardiology Division of the Philippine Heart Center, also told AFP that the claims are \"medical myths.\"\n\nDuring a phone conversation with AFP on February 27, 2020, Javelosa said that heart diseases most often arise from a combination of factors including \u201ccholesterol, sugar, stress and smoking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you reduce those, you reduce the risks of heart attack,\u201d he said. \u201cDrinking a glass of water will not change all those.\u201d\n\nFact-checking organizations Africa Check and Full Fact have also debunked similar misleading claims about timing water intake here and here.", "lang": "en"}
