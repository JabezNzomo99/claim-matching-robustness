As the injured deer drops to the ground, the men in the video run towards it, while the shooter asks, \u201cWhere\u2019s the knife?\u201d He is handed one and he, along with the other men, run towards the animal, saying \u201cQuickly, quickly.\u201d \u201cTake a video,\u201d he says and then proceeds to slit open the animal\u2019s neck. The video has been shared on Twitter and Facebook with the same claim.

This video is been in circulation for last couple of days! Not aware whether this is new or old one! Pls take action against these b*******s! @PrakashJavdekar @moefcc @ParveenKaswan pic.twitter.com/bfZBilfl0f \u2014 Anil Kumar M (@AniltheMatrix) October 28, 2019 While the incident in the video took place, it is actually from Bangladesh and not from India at all. Moreover, the incident took place in 2015. While going through the various posts of this video on Twitter, we came across a clarification issued on the video by IFS officer Parveen Kaswan. He said that the video was being circulated for the last week and that it was from Chittagong, Bangladesh. He further said that the video, when it had surfaced had been flagged to the Bangladesh authorities. The person in the video had been identified as Moin Uddin and it was found that the incident happened in Chittagong\u2019s Hillsdale Farm. This video is being circulated from last one week. I have clarified it many times it is from Bangladesh. When it surfaced, msg was shared with Bangladesh authorities. The person was identified as Moin Uddin at Hillsdale Farm in Chittagong, Bangladesh. https://t.co/VZmchkTcVw \u2014 Parveen Kaswan, IFS (@ParveenKaswan) October 27, 2019 On searching for news reports about such an incident, we came across an article by The Daily Star, a Bangladeshi English-language newspaper. The report, dated July 2015, said the incident had happened in the last week of June, and said that the video had first been uploaded on Facebook in July 2015. According to a follow-up report published in the same month, the Department of Forest (DoF) had initiated actions against Moin Uddin. Therefore, while the incident is from 2015, it is not from India, contrary to the claims. Edited Photo of Golden Temple Viral as That of Diwali Celebration", "lang": "en"}
