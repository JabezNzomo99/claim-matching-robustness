I don\u2019t want thoughts. I want gun control,\u201d Susan Orfanos said. \u201cAnd I hope to God nobody else sends me any more prayers. I want gun control. No more guns.\u201d\n\nOrfanos\u2019 son, U.S. Navy veteran Telemachus \u201cTel\u201d Orfanos, had previously survived the mass October 2017 Las Vegas shooting before being killed in the Borderline Bar & Grill.\n\nNow, conspiracy theorists have used images of the mother alongside photos of women affected by other mass shootings to advance the idea that she is an actor, and that they are all the same person. The fact-free assertion is not unlike claims we debunked about the students who survived the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting.\n\nA Facebook user, who appears to subscribe to the massive \u201cQAnon\u201d conspiracy theory, spread the unsubstantiated claim about Orfanos by posting a screenshot of her interview with screenshots of a mother and of a victim from other mass shootings. He wrote: \u201cJUST SO YOU KNOW NOT ONLY WAS SHE A MOM OF THE CALIFORNIA AND ORLANDO SHOOTINGS, BUT SHE WAS A VITCIM (sic) OF THE Las Vegas SHOOTING TOO!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\u201d\n\nThe other images are not of Orfanos, nor do they resemble her \u2014 something that didn\u2019t stop thousands from sharing and liking versions of the conspiracy theory through memes and posts on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nThe woman wearing a pink shirt in the Facebook post is actually Christine Leinonen, whose son, Christopher \u201cDrew\u201d Leinonen, died in the 2016 Orlando, Florida, shooting in the Pulse nightclub. The image of Leinonen is taken from an ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos before she learned that her son had been killed.\n\nLeinonen has since helped form the Dru Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, and spoke in favor of gun control at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.\n\nAnother woman falsely identified as being Orfanos is Jan Lambourne, who was shot in the abdomen during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and survived. The image in the Facebook post is a screenshot from a CBC News interview she gave while recovering in the hospital. Lambourne, of the Manitoba province of Canada, can be seen in more recent photographs in a report documenting her recovery.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nKeneally, Meghan and Doug Lantz. \u201cMother of Orlando Shooting Victim Searching for Answers.\u201d ABC News. 13 Jun 2016.\n\nLaw, Tara. \u201cNavy Veteran Survived Las Vegas Shooting Only to Be Killed in the Borderline Bar 1 Year Later.\u201d 9 Nov 2018.\n\nStanley-Becker, Isaac. \u201cThousand Oaks parents: \u2018I don\u2019t want prayers.
