[1]\n\n\u201cThey ripped out $14 billion from public education,\u201d he told ABC radio\u2019s AM program. \u201cThey never put the money back that they took in that 2014 budget from public schools.\u201d\n\nSo has the coalition government cut $14 billion from public education?\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Labor\u2019s funding for government schools in its last federal budget in 2013, and government schools funding in budgets since the coalition took office in September 2013.\n\nIn the 2013 budget, Labor pledged $9.8 billion in extra funding for schools over a six-year span up to 2017/18. However about $2.8 billion was allocated in the first four years, with almost $7 billion unfunded. [2]\n\nLiberal leader Tony Abbott promised a \u201cunity ticket\u201d on school funding before the 2013 election. However, coalition policy documents show that commitment to match Labor \u201cdollar-for-dollar\u201d was restricted to four years from 2014. [3] [4]\n\nIn the 2014-15 budget under the Abbott government $5.11 billion was allocated before rising to $5.75 billion in 2015-16. The figure was $6.44 billion in 2016-17 under the Turnbull government lifting to $7.08 billion in 2017-18, $7.69 billion in 2018-19 and $8.33 billion in 2019-20 under the Morrison government. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]\n\nThe origin of the $14 billion figure first arose in claims made by Labor about changes to school funding made by the coalition in 2014.\n\nTreasurer Joe Hockey\u2019s first budget in 2014-15 set out changes to funding arrangements for public hospitals and schools to generate $80 billion in \u201ctotal savings\u201d to 2024-25. The budget also included a table showing how projections compared to Labor\u2019s plan. [11]\n\nIn his 2014 budget reply speech the then-Labor leader Bill Shorten claimed this as an $80 billion \u201ccut\u201d to schools and hospitals. However, a 2016 fact check by economists Peter Sivey and Buly Cardak in The Conversation pointed out that according to the 2014 budget chart, funding for schools and hospitals continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace than under Labor\u2019s pre-election funding promise. [12][13][14]\n\nWhen questioned by Labor senator Penny Wong in a Senate Economics Legislation Committee in 2014, Treasury official Nigel Ray broke down the $80 billion of \u201csavings\u201d as roughly $30 billion for schools and $50 billion for hospitals by 2024-25. [15]\n\nLabor seized on this figure with deputy leader Tanya Plibersek and opposition education spokeswoman Kate Ellis labelling it a \u201c$30 billion cut to education\u201d in a media release on May 20, 2014. [16]\n\nThe figure was whittled down in May 2017 as coalition policy documents touted $22.3 billion in \u201csavings\u201d from 2018 to 2027 compared to Labor\u2019s funding arrangements. Ms Plibersek again deemed it a \u201ccut\u201d and claimed it equated to sacking 22,000 teachers. [17] [18]\n\nThe figure dropped to about $17 billion after the Turnbull government agreed to an extra $5 billion in school funding, rolled out over six years rather than 10, to win support for its so-called Gonski 2.0 plan to pass through the Senate in June 2017. [19]\n\nThe figure\u2019s most recent resting point relies on Parliamentary Budget Office and the National Catholic Education Commission data, which was released by Labor in February 2018, purporting to show 86 per cent of the $17 billion - equating to $14 billion - in \u201ccuts\u201d would affect public schools. [20]\n\nAt the 2019 federal election, Ms Plibersek said voters had a clear choice between Labor\u2019s public schools investment \u201cor the LNP\u2019s $14 billion of cuts\u201d. [21]\n\nRMIT ABC Fact Check took Ms Plibersek to task over the claim in 2019, delivering a verdict of \u201cmisleading\u201d as they had for her $22 billion cut declaration in 2017. [22] [23]\n\nWhen asked on December 5 for the source of Mr Albanese\u2019s $14 billion claim, a spokesman for the opposition leader referred AAP FactCheck to an article on an Australian Education Union-affiliated campaign web page, Fair Funding Now. The article, titled \u2018The Facts: Scott Morrison\u2019s $14 billion public school cuts\u2019, details a timeline for the $14 billion in \u201ccuts\u201d. [24]\n\nMr Albanese\u2019s office also cited the 2014-15 budget overview document, which includes a table illustrating $80 billion in \u201csavings\u201d in spending on schools and hospitals. [25]\n\nAAP FactCheck contacted two economists to seek opinion on whether the funding situation amounted to a cut.\n\nAMP chief economist Dr Shane Oliver told AAP FactCheck via email: \u201cI find it hard to regard it as a cut because school spending has actually still been increasing.\u201d\n\nChris Richardson, a partner and economist at Deloitte Access Economics, agreed and said as \u201cothers have noted - that (Labor\u2019s projection) was never a sensible baseline to compare against\u201d.\n\n\"Effectively, it was never legislated, and never funded,\" he told AAP FactCheck in an email.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck has found the claim to be mostly false. Two economists have agreed that funding of government schools has continued to rise. Labor has claimed the \u201csavings\u201d outlined in the coalition\u2019s 2014-15 budget of $80 billion amount to a \u201ccut\u201d and has continued to claim that the proportion of those \u201csavings\u201d relevant to schools amount to lost funding. Labor did announce an increased spending trajectory in its 2013 budget however the funding commitments were only for four years. The commitments did not extend to 2024-25. It is worth noting, however, that while Labor\u2019s claim that the funding has been cut is not supported, the coalition has claimed the same unfunded spending as a saving.", "lang": "en"}
