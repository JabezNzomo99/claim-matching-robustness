And when you read them, pay attention to the following signs that the article may be fake. There are fake news stories generated by both left-leaning and right-leaning websites, and the same rules apply to both.\n\nThe use of \u201c.co\u201d at the end of the URL is a strong clue you are looking at a fake news website. (It signifies the Internet country code domain assigned to the country of Colombia.) But there are other signs as well.\n\nSome fake news sites don\u2019t have any contact information, which easily demonstrates it\u2019s phony. The fake \u201cABC News\u201d does have a \u201ccontact us\u201d page \u2014 but it shows a picture of the controversial Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan. (An inside joke?) The real television network is based in New York City, housed in a 13-story building on 66th Street.\n\nOn the fake ABC News site there is an article claiming a protester was paid $3,500 to protest Trump. It\u2019s supposedly written by Jimmy Rustling. \u201cDr. Jimmy Rustling has won many awards for excellence in writing including fourteen Peabody awards and a handful of Pulitzer Prizes,\u201d the author biography claims. If that doesn\u2019t seem absurd, then how about the fact that he claims to have a Russian mail order bride of almost two months and \u201calso spends 12-15 hours each day teaching their adopted 8-year-old Syrian refugee daughter how to read and write.\u201d\n\nMany fake articles have made-up quotes that do not pass the laugh test. About midway through the article on the protest, the founder of Snopes.com \u2014 which debunks fakes news on the Internet \u2014 is suddenly \u201cquoted,\u201d saying he approves of the article. It also goes on to describe Snopes as \u201ca website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet.\u201d It\u2019s like a weird inside joke, and in the readers\u2019 minds it should raise immediate red flags.\n\nSometimes fake articles are based on merely a tweet. The New York Times documented how the fake news that anti-Trump protesters were bused in started with a single, ill-informed tweet by a man with just 40 followers. Another apparently fake story, that Trump fed police officers working protests in Chicago, also started with a tweet \u2014 by a man who wasn\u2019t even there but was passing along a claim made by \u201cfriends.\u201d The tweeter also has a locked account, making the \u201cnews\u201d highly dubious. Few real news stories are based on a single tweet, with no additional confirmation.\n\nA profusion of pop-up ads or other advertising indicates you should handle the story with care. Another sign is a bunch of sexy ads or links, designed to be clicked \u2014 \u201cCelebs who did Porn Movies\u201d or \u201cNaughty Walmart Shoppers Who have no Shame at All\u201d \u2014 which you generally do not find on legitimate news sites.\n\nA simple Google search often will quickly tell you if the news you are reading is fake. Our friends at Snopes have also compiled a Field Guide to Fake News Sites, allowing you to check whether the article comes from a fraudster. There is also a website called RealorSatire.com that allows you to post the URL of any article and it will quickly tell you if the article comes from a fake or biased news website.\n\nCombating the spread of fake news begins with you, the reader. If it seems too fantastic, it probably is. Please think before you share.", "lang": "en"}
