This picture was clicked at Mumbai's Juhu beach in 1937, when Gandhi was convalescing after an illness and was living in RD Birla's bungalow at Juhu.\n\nThe misinformation along with the viral photo was carried by \"Daily Mail\", \"Hindustan Times\" and \"Navbharat Times\" when Kanu Gandhi passed away in 2016.\n\nRecently, journalist Kamalika Ghosh tweeted the photo along with the caption: \"What kind of a mother takes a child to a protest?\" Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Kanu Ramdas Gandhi, the kid who walked ahead of Mahatma holding one end of his stick at Dandi Yatra protest during the historic Salt Satyagraha of March-April 1930.\n\nThe misleading information about this photo is also circulating on Facebook.\n\nWe found five evidence that proves the viral photo is not from Dandi March but Juhu beach seven years later.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found the photo on \"Getty Images\" with the caption, \"Mahatma GANDHI having fun with one of his grandchildren on a Juhu beach, near Bombay (India)\".\n\nWith the help of related keywords, AFWA found valuable data of the Archaeological Survey of India from the website of Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts. Here, a book titled 'MAHATMA-LIFE OF MOHANDAS KARAMCHAND GANDHI' used the viral photo, saying it was taken in December 1937 at Mumbai's Juhu beach.\n\nOn November 8, 2016, the official handle of Congress tweeted this historic photo with the caption - \"Mahatma Gandhi with grandson Kanubhai Gandhi at Juhu beach in Bombay in 1937\".\n\nThe website of Mani Bhavan Gandhi Sangrahalaya, a museum dedicated to Bapu's stay in Mumbai, also confirms that the photo was taken in 1937 at Juhu beach.\n\nThe website has recorded the chronological sketch of Gandhi when he visited Mumbai between 1915 and 1948. It clearly says that from December 7-13, 1937, he was in \"Bombay\" (Mumbai) and suffering from illness.\n\nTo further verify the authenticity of the photo, we reached out to A Annamalai, the director of National Gandhi Museum and Library in New Delhi. He too confirmed that the photo was taken at Juhu beach and the kid in the picture is Kanu Ramdas. Annamalai told AFWA that he had confirmed the details of the photo with Bapu's granddaughter Sumitra Gandhi Kulkarni.\n\nIt should also be noted that Kanu Ramdas Gandhi was born in 1928 and Dandi March was taken out in 1930 when he was only two years old - something not reflected in the photo. The Dandi March or Salt Satyagraha was a civil disobedience movement led by Gandhi against high taxation on salt by the British in colonial India.\n\nHowever, upon investigating further, we found that one of Bapu's grandnephews was also called Kanu Gandhi. As per the website of this Kanu Gandhi, he did take part in the civil disobedience movement in 1932, at the age of 15, and was also arrested for the same. But the child seen in this historic picture holding Mahatma's stick is not the grandnephew Kanu Gandhi but the grandson of Bapu.\n\nAFWA concluded that the viral photo is not from Dandi March of 1930. This photo was clicked in 1937 at Mumbai's Juhu beach.", "lang": "en"}
