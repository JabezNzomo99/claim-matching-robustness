Not one in three, as Weatherford said.\n\nDuffy acknowledged the flub. He insisted Weatherford has cited the statistic correctly in the past.\n\nFor us, the facts here aligned pretty easily (thanks, Twitter). Weatherford said one in three Florida students graduates high school prepared for college. Based on Florida Department of Education data, it\u2019s two in three.", "lang": "en"}
