The same video is also being shared as that of a shopping centre at Mohammed Ali Road in Mumbai (archived) and also at New Market in Kolkata (archived). FACTLY has found the video was taken at a shopping bazaar in Pakistan, not in any city of India. The video was taken at New Anarkali Bazaar in Faisalabad (Pakistan). So, the video has nothing to do with India. Earlier, when the same video went viral as that of a shopping centre in Old city (Hyderabad), FACTLY has debunked the claim and written a fact-check which can be read here.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
