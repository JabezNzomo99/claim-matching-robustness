The claim is false: an online search reveals that the clip was filmed in 2016, years before the novel coronavirus pandemic began.\n\nA Facebook post shared the video on May 24, 2020, with the caption: \u201cNo masks. No social distancing. No curfews. No lockdown - Tanzania celebrations after defeating corona\u201d. The clip has been viewed more than 200,000 times.\n\nThe same video was shared here with an almost identical caption. Since June 12, 2020, it has been viewed more than 4,000 times.\n\nOther posts like these here, here and here shared hundreds of times have used the same footage and claimed that it shows Magufuli playing the drums in church. \u201cNo wonder there is no covid 19 in Tanzania,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cThis is the same man that declared that he will not shutdown church because Jesus Christ is bigger than coronavirious.\u201d\n\nBut the footage predates the outbreak of novel coronavirus. A search on video verification platform WeVerify found older versions of the clip from 2016, 2017 and 2018. A search on YouTube using the keywords \u201cMagufuli playing the drum\u201d also led to the video here and here.\n\nA caption on one of the videos uploaded by EATV, the East Africa 24-hour entertainment television channel, contained details of the event.\n\n\u201cPresident Magufuli entertains guests at the University of Dar es Salaam after laying the foundation stone for the construction of new hostels, this morning,\u201d reads the Swahili post on EATVs Facebook page, published on October 21, 2016.\n\nAFP Fact Check searched a calendar with Magufuli\u2019s public engagements on the official website of the Tanzanian presidency. It showed that on the day, he attended a ceremony at the University of Dar es Salaam to mark the construction of new hostels.\n\nThe images featured in the government blogpost are the same as the video frames circulating in the misleading Facebook posts.\n\nThe new coronavirus is believed to have emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.\n\nTanzania recorded its first infection on March 16, 2020, but has not released any data since April 29. By the last count, there were 509 positive cases and 21 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nWhile countries across Africa have taken tough measures against the pandemic, Magufuli has downplayed its gravity and is on record encouraging gathering in places of worship, as reported by AFP.\n\nOn June 8, 2020, the BBC reported that Magufuli had declared Tanzania free of the virus \u201cthanks to prayer by citizens\u201d.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked other claims relating to COVID-19 and Tanzania here.\n\u2022 This review was updated to include a reference to another false claim, namely that the same video footage shows Magufuli in church.", "lang": "en"}
