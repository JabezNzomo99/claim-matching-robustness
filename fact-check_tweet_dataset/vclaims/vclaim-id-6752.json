Johnny Rogan\u2019s biography of the Byrds, for example, describes such plotting by two of the group\u2019s members, frontman Gene Clark and drummer Michael Clarke:\n\nGene had previous escaped [the draft] due to a knee injury incurred when he played football in his teens. But the diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatters disease was remedied by rest and physiotherapy, so it was not long before he was re-examined. This time, he feigned madness, employing whatever drugs were at his disposal to enhance the desired effects. \u201cGene was living with me at the time,\u201d Clarke told me. \u201cWe did a programme and it was hard getting Gene out of the draft. They weren\u2019t buying that bullshit about his leg. I kept him up for a week. Thanks to massive amounts of dexedrine he screwed up all the tests. They looked up his ass. It was seriously demeaning. But we were the best of brothers and I helped get him out.\u201d \u201cWhen I went in, it was major shit. I wore these stupid pants and sandals. I sat there cross-legged and suggested I had a problem. They were waiting for somebody to try and get out and their attitude was \u2018You\u2019re front line, dude.\u2019 I got through the tests. There was a form with the question, \u2018Are you a homosexual?\u2019 I wrote \u2018No!\u2019, then changed it to \u2018Yes\u2019, then \u2018No\u2019 again, then crossed it out a few times. I knew all the answers and freaked out. I followed the yellow line and I had to take a piss. They give you this thing to carry and I threw it down on the floor and went over in the corner and took a piss. The guy said, \u2018This is very serious \u2026 You can\u2019t do that!\u2019 I turned around and accidentally ended up pissing on him. Then somebody tried to take my stuff, so I jumped in and said, \u2018Take your hands off my stuff or I\u2019ll kill you. I\u2019m serious\u2019 I\u2019d got my hands round this guy\u2019s neck. Right away, they sent me to the psychiatrist\u2019s office. They were looking at me thinking, \u2018Is he for real or is he bullshitting us?\u2019 There was one guy there with long hair who went to Vietnam, but I didn\u2019t. You had to be good. The psychiatrist asked me, \u2018Have you ever done it with a woman?\u2019 I said, \u2018No!\u2019 He said, \u2018Have you ever wanted to?\u2019 I said, \u2018No!\u2019 He said, \u2018Have you ever done it with a man?\u2019 I said, \u2018No!\u2019 He was just looking at me \u2014 that\u2019s all he was doing. Finally, he said, \u2018Get the hell out of here.\u2019 They ran me down the red line and booted my ass out of there \u2014 \u2018Get out of here, you faggot bastard, schizoid homosexual, not fit for military service at any time \u2014 4-F.\u2019 I ran out the door, jumped in my Porsche, beat it back to the beach and was laughing all the way. If you think I wanted to go to Vietnam, you were out of your mind. I was making too much goddamn money.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with published by High Times magazine in 1977, Ted Nugent claimed he had engaged in similar behavior to deliberately fail a physical exam in 1967 and be qualified 4-F (not acceptable for military service):\n\nInterviewer: How did you get out of the draft? Ted Nugent: Ted was a young boy, appearing to be a hippie but quite opposite in fact, working hard and playing hard, playing rock and roll like a deviant. People would question my sanity, I played so much. So I got my notice to be in the draft. Do you think I was gonna lay down my guitar and go play army? Give me a break! I was busy doin\u2019 it to it. I had a career Jack. If I was walkin\u2019 around, hippying down, getting\u2019 loaded and pickin\u2019 my ass like your common curs, I\u2019d say \u201cHey yeah, go in the army. Beats the poop out of scuffin\u2019 around in the gutters.\u201d But I wasn\u2019t a gutter dog. I was a hard workin\u2019, mother****in\u2019 rock and roll musician. I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin\u2019 and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin\u2019 kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and I\u2019d drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up. See, I approached the whole thing like, Ted Nugent, cool hard-workin\u2019 dude, is gonna wreak havoc on these imbeciles in the armed forces. I\u2019m gonna play their own game, and I\u2019m gonna destroy \u2019em. Now my whole body is crusted in poop and piss. I was ill. And three or four days before, I started stayin\u2019 awake. I was close to death, but I was in control. I was extremely antidrug as I\u2019ve always been, but I snorted some crystal methedrine. Talk about one wounded motherf*cker. A guy put up four lines, and it was for all four of us, but I didn\u2019t know and I\u2019m vacuuming that poop right up. I was a walking, talking hunk of human poop. I was six-foot-three of sin. So the guys took me down to the physical, and my nerves, my emotions were distraught. I was not a good person. I was wounded. But as painful and nauseous as it was \u2014 \u2019cause I was really into bein\u2019 clean and on the ball \u2014 I made gutter swine hippies look like football players. I was deviano. So I went in, and those guys in uniform couldn\u2019t believe the smell. They were ridiculin\u2019 me and pushin\u2019 me around and I was cryin\u2019, but all the time I was laughin\u2019 to myself. When they stuck the needle in my arm for the blood test I passed out, and when I came to they were kicking me into the wall. Then they made everybody take off their pants, and I did, and this sergeant says, \u201cOh my God, put those back on! You f*cking swine you!\u201d Then they had a urine test and I couldn\u2019t piss, But my poop was just like ooze, man, so I poop in the cup and put it on the counter. I had poop on my hand and my arm. The guy almost puked. I was so proud. I knew I had these chumps beat. The last thing I remember was wakin\u2019 up in the ear test booth and they were sweepin\u2019 up. So I went home and cleaned up. They took a putty knife to me. I got the street rats out of my hair, ate some good steaks, beans, potatoes, cottage cheese, milk. A couple of days and I was ready to kick ass. And in the mail I got this big juicy 4-F. They\u2019d call dead people before they\u2019d call my ass. But you know the funny thing about it? I\u2019d make an incredible army man. I\u2019d be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and I\u2019d have the baddest bunch of motherf*ckin\u2019 killers you\u2019d ever seen in my platoon. But I just wasn\u2019t into it. I was too busy doin\u2019 my own thing, you know?\n\nQuestioned about that account some thirty years later (by which time Nugent was known as a staunch political conservative, a supporter of the Republican Party, and an advocate of hunting and gun ownership rights) in an interview with the UK\u2019s Independent newspaper, Nugent disclaimed that previous account of his draft-evading activities as story he had made up and fed to a gullible High Times reporter and asserted that he actually had avoided the draft through the legitimate means of a student deferment:\n\nHe has the rage, but he doesn\u2019t have the war record. At 18, he was called up to serve in Vietnam. \u201cIn 1977 you gave an interview to High Times [the cannabis user\u2019s journal of record] where you claimed you defecated in your clothes to avoid the draft.\u201d \u201cI never shit my pants to get out of the draft,\u201d says Nugent, good-naturedly. \u201cYou also told them you took crystal meth before the medical \u2014 as a result of which, and I quote: \u2018I got this big juicy 4F.'\u201d \u201cUnbelievable. Meth,\u201d he replies, in a tone of deep sarcasm. \u201cYes, that\u2019s my drug of choice. You\u2019ve got to realise that these interviewers would arrive with glazed eyes and I would make stories up. I never did crystal meth. And I never pooped my pants.\u201d \u201cBut you did dodge the draft.\u201d \u201cYou said then that you wanted \u2018to teach the stupid bastards in the military a lesson\u2019. I\u2019d have thought you\u2019d have loved the army. Guns. Travel. Danger.\u201d \u201cBack then, I didn\u2019t even understand what World War II was.\u201d \u201cSo basically,\u201d \u2014 I admit that I have, unaccountably, started to speak Nugent \u2014 \u201cyou didn\u2019t want to get your Michigan ass blown off in Vietnam.\u201d \u201cCorrect. I did not want to get my ass blown off in Vietnam.\u201d\n\nClearly, though, Ted Nugent didn\u2019t make up the tale about his snorting crystal meth before his pre-induction physical as a one-off jape just to fool a High Times reporter, as he said the same thing in an interview with CREEM magazine:\n\nAn analysis of Ted Nugent\u2019s Selective Service classification record doesn\u2019t prove or disprove either version of the story. He did indeed receive a high school student deferment (1-S) in 1967 and then (as he stated) a college student deferment (2-S) in 1968. However, he was reclassified as \u201cavailable for military service\u201d (1-A) in 1969 and then subsequently rejected as a result of a physical examination and given a 1-Y classification. (The 1-Y classification denoted persons \u201cqualified for service only in time of war or national emergency\u201d and was generally assigned to registrants who had exhibited medical conditions that were limiting but not disabling.) After the 1-Y classification was eliminated by the Selective Service at the end of 1971, Nugent was reclassified as 4-F (\u201cregistrant not qualified for any military service\u201d).\n\nSo, Ted Nugent did have a student deferment for part of the time he was eligible for the Vietnam-era draft, but he also did fail a physical examination and receive a medical exemption (which, as far as we know, he has neither acknowledged nor explained). But in the absence of more specific information about the results of that physical examination and the reasons for his medical exemption, it cannot be ascertained how truthful the account Nugent gave to High Times magazine back in 1977 might be. (Ted Nugent\u2019s press representative did not respond to a request for additional information about this subject.)", "lang": "en"}
