Kamala Harris vowed to take on Big Oil and other powerful interests when they \"profit off of harmful behaviors\" such as burning fossil fuels.\n\nIn answer to a direct question, she claimed she already did that as California\u2019s attorney general.\n\n\"So, Senator Harris, what would you do? Would you sue them? Sue Exxon Mobil?\" asked moderator Erin Burnett.\n\nWe decided to fact check it.\n\nWe found Harris\u2019 office investigated Exxon in 2016 over allegations it lied to the public and its shareholders about the risk to its business from climate change. The Los Angeles Times detailed that probe in a January 2016 news article. It said Exxon rejected the allegations.\n\nBut there\u2019s no public record, and nothing that Harris\u2019 campaign could provide, to show she filed a lawsuit against the company.\n\n\"The facts are Harris opened an investigation against Exxon for lying about climate change. She didn\u2019t take that further even though she should have and other attorney generals did,\" said Kassie Siegel, climate director at the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund. \"She did bring some cases against oil companies. I\u2019m not aware of a case that she actually brought against Exxon. And she didn\u2019t bring the case against Exxon for lying about climate change.\"\n\nIan Sams, a campaign spokesman for Harris, told us she \"launched an investigation into Exxon,\" but he would not directly address her claim that she sued the company.\n\nHe told The New York Times that, \"as attorney general (Harris) sued Chevron, BP, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 for pollution activities, helping win $50 million in settlements.\" Sams provided PolitiFact California with links to articles and news releases supporting those actions.\n\nIn their own fact checks, the Times and CNN reported they found no evidence supporting Harris\u2019 claim that she sued Exxon.\n\n\"As Cal AG, Harris opened a file shortly after the #ExxonKnew news broke in fall 2015. She never did anything with it,\" RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic Party's environmental caucus and president of the Climate Hawks Vote Super PAC, said on Twitter during the town hall.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris claimed at a recent climate town hall that she \"sued Exxon Mobil\" as California attorney general.\n\nShe opened an investigation into the oil giant over allegations it was lying to the public and its shareholders about climate change. But there\u2019s no public evidence, or any from her campaign, that she ever filed a lawsuit against the company.\n\nHarris did sue other oil companies and win settlements over allegations they violated various state laws governing hazardous materials, according to information provided by her campaign. But none of that includes a lawsuit against Exxon.\n\nHarris clearly tangled with Big Oil as California AG. There\u2019s just no record she sued one of the industry\u2019s biggest companies, Exxon.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
