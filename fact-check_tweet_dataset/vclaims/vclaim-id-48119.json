Some are about personal medical problems and social distancing; others are with health care professionals talking about supply shortages.\n\nOne ad features Frank Mora, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University.\n\nMora\u2019s first line is \"President Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic crisis has been, to say the least, disappointing.\"\n\nThe ad goes back and forth between Mora talking directly to the camera, news clips and dates from the last three months. Mora\u2019s voiceover says that Trump and his administration\u2019s action against the coronavirus were too late and that there were signs that COVID-19 was a threat to Americans early on.\n\nThe ads use the same slogan: \"Donald Trump keeps failing us. America is paying the price.\"\n\nThe Florida ad with Mora is partially accurate but it also cherry-picks dates and exaggerates to make the case that Trump didn\u2019t take enough action.\n\nThis is an exaggeration. Mora is referring to a WHO news release from Jan. 5 that said China informed the organization that there were pneumonia cases from an unidentified virus in the city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019.\n\nBy Jan. 3, 2020, national authorities in China had reported at least 44 cases to the WHO, but they still hadn\u2019t isolated what virus was causing these infections. The Jan. 5 WHO response didn\u2019t recommend any specific measures for travelers and advised against restrictions on travel or trade, based on the information they had at the time.\n\nChinese officials and the WHO still didn\u2019t know if the disease could spread person-to-person, and infections were extremely localized.\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t exactly what the CDC said on this date. A CDC health advisory announced an investigation in Wuhan of a new disease that was leading to symptoms of pneumonia. The advisory stated that \"no human-to-human transmission has been reported.\" It didn\u2019t identify the disease as being caused by a virus, and at this point the disease hadn\u2019t traveled outside of China, or even Wuhan.\n\nOn Jan. 10, after the disease had been identified as viral, the CDC said in a risk assessment that \"based on current information, the risk from the Novel Coronavirus 2019 to the American public is deemed to be low.\"\n\nThis too is an exaggeration. President Trump did appear dismissive of COVID-19 at first, saying in a Jan. 22 CNBC interview, \"We have it under control.\". After eight cases had been reported in the U.S. on Feb. 2, he told Fox News host Sean Hannity, \"We pretty much shut it down.\" At a Feb. 26 press conference, he still referred to it as \"similar to the flu.\"\n\nBut saying his administration \"did nothing\" is not accurate. The President\u2019s Coronavirus Task Force was formed on Jan. 29 to \"to monitor, contain, and mitigate the spread of the virus.\" That task force announced on Jan. 31 that the coronavirus presented a public health emergency in the United States and instituted a travel ban against foreigners coming from China. The Coronavirus Task Force went on to brief lawmakers and governors on the danger that COVID-19 posed in early February. However, it wasn\u2019t until Feb. 25 that the Trump administration asked Congress for $2.5 billion in funding to combat the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThis quote from Trump is in dispute. President Trump is known for using the terms \"hoax\" and \"witch hunt\" regularly. Understanding how and why he used that word in connection to the coronavirus at a rally in Charleston, S.C. is a little more complicated.\n\nAfter accusing Democrats of \"politicizing the coronavirus,\" Trump blasted the 2016 Russia investigation and his impeachment in the House \u2014 both of which he has labeled a hoax \u2014 before briefly turning back to the virus. \"Think of it,\" he said. \"And this is their new hoax.\"\n\nThe next day, Trump said he was referring to the Democrats\u2019 response to the coronavirus as a hoax, rather than to COVID-19 itself.\n\nRELATED STORY: The president who cried hoax? Experts weigh in on Trump\u2019s use of the word\n\nThis is accurate. According to the Trump campaign website, he held nine campaign rallies before halting his campaign tour on March 11. There is also documentation from the press and social media that show he went golfing six times in 2020.\n\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Viral post compares dates on when Trump admitted coronavirus was a problem\n\nYes, the original estimate was that 100,000 to 200,000 Americans would die from COVID-19. Those numbers were released at a White House press conference on March 31.\n\nSix days before Priorities USA released this ad, however, the White House Coronavirus Task Force announced those numbers had lowered to around 60,000 deaths. This was largely attributed to successful social distancing.\n\nMora also said in the ad that the projected deaths from COVID-19 are \"a result of two months of critical time that were lost.\" But Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the leading scientists on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said in an interview with CNN that the timeline can\u2019t be connected so directly. \"Obviously it would have been nice if we had a better head start,\" Fauci said. \"I don\u2019t think you can say that we are where we are because of one factor.\"", "lang": "en"}
