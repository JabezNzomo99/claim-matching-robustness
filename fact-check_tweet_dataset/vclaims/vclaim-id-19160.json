Each country takes care of its own security, and as part of the study of possible threats, a model could have been created.\u201d\n\nMirzayanov added that while test samples could be from \u201cmany countries,\u201d the production of Novichok \u201cwas fine-tuned only in the USSR (former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) and Russia.\u201d\n\nWhile questions remain over the manufacture of the Novichok employed in the Salisbury attack, the identities of the attackers is better established.\n\nThe suspects, operating under the aliases Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov, were identified as GRU (Russian military intelligence) agents Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin by The Insider, a Russian investigative news site, in conjunction with the investigative group Bellingcat.\n\nA third suspected GRU agent, Denis Sergeyev (aka Sergey Fedotov), was also in the U.K. at the time of the poisoning. His alleged role in the attack remains unclear.\n\nDuring an interview with RT editor in chief Margarita Simonyan, Chepiga and Mishkin, who were in Salisbury on the day of the attack, claimed they were \u201cjust friends,\u201d \u201ccivilians,\u201d and tourists\u201d visiting the town\u2019s \u201cfamous cathedral.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ambassador Karen Pierce, the U.K.\u2019s Permanent Representative to the UN, said the trail of evidence linking Chepiga and Mishkin to the attack is quite clear.\n\n\u201cCCTV and other evidence records their travel to and from Salisbury and crucially, there are images which clearly places them in the vicinity of the Skripal\u2019s house at 11:58 A.M. on Sunday, 4 March. This was moments before the attack took place, which involved placing the substance on the Skripal\u2019s front door handle,\u201d she said.\n\nThe police timeline had the suspects returning to Moscow on the same day the Skripals were poisoned.\n\nIn November 2018, British authorities released CCTV footage showing Chepiga and Mishkin walking past a gas station on Wilton Road near the Skripals\u2019 home.\n\nThe Salisbury Cathedral, whose spire is visible from the train station, is in the opposite direction of the victim\u2019s residence.\n\n\u200bTraces of Novichok were later found in the London hotel where the two men stayed. A perfume bottle that held the chemical agent was also recovered.\u200b\n\nRussia\u2019s U.K. Embassy has previously cited false theories to deflect blame from the Kremlin, including the baseless claim that the Skripals had driven to a top-secret chemical weapons lab on the day of the attack.\n\nWhile questions remain about the poisoning of the Skripals, Polygraph.info finds the claim that there is an utter lack of evidence linking Moscow to the attack to be false.", "lang": "en"}
