The message posted along with the video claimed that it depicted a student protest that took place in Kashmir. \u201cPolice use teargas to disperse student protest #kashmirnews #freedom #newskashmir\u201d, reads the message. The post has amassed nearly 1,700 shares at the time of writing this article. It has now been deleted.\n\nAlt News found that the Facebook page, which had shared the video, is impersonating BBC News by using the British news organisation\u2019s name and logo. Moreover, BBC News does not have state-wise offices but its services in India are categorised on the basis of language and not geographical locations, i.e., states.\n\nA look at the \u2018page transparency\u2019 section of the \u2018BBC News Kashmir\u2019 revealed that the page is operated from Bangladesh and was created on August 6, 2019.\n\nFurthermore, the video is actually from Jakarta, Indonesia and not Kashmir, India. With a relevant keyword search on Google, Alt News found that the video depicts a clash between the protesters and the Indonesian police (\u2018Polisi\u2019 in Bahasa) in September 2019. \u201cIndonesian students clashed with police during a demonstration in Jakarta, on 30 September 2019, Indonesia. Demonstrations were held to urge the government and parliament to cancel the revision of the Indonesian Code Law and Anti-Corruption Law which weakened the function of the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK)\u201d, reads the description given along with a visually similar Getty Image photo shot on Septemeber 30, 2019.\n\nSome of the visuals from the protest can also been seen in the video below.\n\nIn conclusion, a Facebook page impersonating BBC News shared a video of a recent protest from Indonesia with the claim that it showed Indian police\u2019s brutality on Kashmir students.", "lang": "en"}
