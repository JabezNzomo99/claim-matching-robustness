No, that's not true: a Belgian satire website is up to its old tricks again, using faked screenshots to make hyperinflated claims about dead and wounded during riots or manifestations. It is not true.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on November 24, 2018 by NordPresse titled \"Gilets jaunes \u00e0 Paris: 23 morts l\u00e9gers, 300 bless\u00e9s graves selon la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision\" (archived here) which only contained this faked screenshot:\n\n\"Morts l\u00e9gers\" means \"lightly dead\" in French, it is a standard catchphrase often used by NordPresse.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nReal riots are currently going on in Paris on the Champs Elysees, as you can see in this live stream:\n\nBut Le Journal Du Nord (nordpresse.be) is a satirical website that was set up to mock the (real) sudpresse.be (since renamed sudinfo.be), a Belgian media group. They were involved in a lawsuit with each other in 2017 which was eventually won by NordPresse.\n\nThey have sort of a disclaimer in their header that reads:\n\nTranslated: \"all information verified by our monkey analysts\".\n\nWe wrote about nordpresse.be before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site, as you can see they have often reported fake news abou the number of dead and injured during various events:\n\u2022 Fake News: No 12 (or 123) Dead At 'Gilets Jaunes' Protests in France\n\u2022 Fake News: French Army Not Getting Ready to Stop Demonstration of Yellow Vests\n\u2022 Fake News: Halloween Purge in France, NO 1600 Cars Burned, NO 320 Wounded, NO 23 Dead\n\u2022 Fake News: NO 12 (Or 89 Or 123 Or 135) Dead, NO 870 Wounded, NO 13000 Cars Burned In French Riots Post World Cup Victory", "lang": "en"}
