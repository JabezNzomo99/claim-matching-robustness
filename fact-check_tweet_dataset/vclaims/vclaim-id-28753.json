The claim is false; the images are of a Vietnamese cable television presenter.\n\nThe photos, which were posted here on Facebook on March 1, 2019 where they have been shared dozens of times, show a woman wearing a low-cut pink blazer with a black lace top underneath.\n\nThe accompanying caption translates to English as: \u201cDoesn't the leadership of iglesia ni cristo (manalo) see the outfit of their anchor. It's not good to look at especially for the children WHO WILL think that it's right to wear inappropriate clothes. And INCtv CALLS ITSELF a religious television (station)\u201d.\n\nIglesia ni Cristo refers to a Christian religious organisation in the Philippines founded by Felix Manalo.\n\n\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nINC has a website for \"executive news\" branded INCTV. Here is its website.\n\nUsing a reverse image search of the photos in the misleading post, AFP traced them back to this article on Vietnamese news site 24h.\n\nThe article contains very similar photographs of the presenter who features in the misleading post.\n\nThe 24h article is headlined: \" Who is the female sports MC dressed so sexy on Vietnamese television?\"\n\nIt identifies the woman in the images as Nguyen Dieu Linh, a sports presenter for state-run Vietnam Television (VTV).\n\nNguyen's Facebook profile, which has nearly 25,000 followers, can be seen here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the first photo in the 24h article, in which Nguyen is wearing the exact same outfit -- a pink blazer over a black top and a pin with a red and white star and a soccer ball -- that is seen in the misleading Facebook photos:\n\nThe pin Nguyen is wearing above her microphone is the logo of VTV's football channel, which can also be seen in the upper right hand corner of the original image.\n\nIn the misleading Facebook images, the logo of INC has been added onto the bottom right hand side of the screen.\n\nThe INC logo can be seen here on a video posted on their official Facebook page.\n\nAnd here is a screenshot of the misleading photo, in which the purported INC logo has been added and circled in red:\n\nNguyen can be seen wearing the same outfit as appears in the misleading Facebook post in this YouTube video.\n\nNguyen also posted a video on her Facebook account on September 8, 2018 which shows her wearing the exact same outfit.\n\nThe video has a caption saying in Vietnamese: \"Have a fun weekend\" followed by a smile face emoji.", "lang": "en"}
