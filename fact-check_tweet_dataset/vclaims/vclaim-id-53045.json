I\u2019m sick of black vs. white. I\u2019m sick of Democrats vs. Republicans. I\u2019m sick of gay vs. straight. I\u2019m sick of Christians vs atheists. I\u2019m REALLY sick of the media.\u201dThe post was shared by someone called Serena Williams, but not the athlete. The \u2018intro\u2019 on this person\u2019s Facebook page says: \u201cNope, not THAT Serena Williams\u201d.\n\nThe original Facebook post can be seen here.\n\nIf you scroll down the athlete\u2019s Facebook page, you can see no similar post. And the profile picture in the viral screenshot does not match any on the tennis player\u2019s page. It seems to be a blurry version of the Facebook user\u2019s old profile picture.\n\nIt also appears that this other Serena Williams did not originally write the text in the post. Fact checker Snopes found a version of it dating back to earlier in the month.", "lang": "en"}
