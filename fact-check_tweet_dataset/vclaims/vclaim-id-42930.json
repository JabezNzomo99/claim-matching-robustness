So today common sense finally prevailed, which is supported by historic documents that there were no such executions and so on,\u201d Kormushkin told Tver News in a video posted on its YouTube channel.\n\nThe Soviet Union invaded Poland in September 1939 and occupied the eastern part of the country at the same time Nazi Germany invaded and occupied western Poland. Under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, the occupying powers divided the country into two separate spheres of control and began eliminating Poland\u2019s military and intellectual elite, as well as its Jewish population.\n\nThe Soviet NKVD, the predecessor of the KGB and FSB, placed thousands of Poles in concentration camps, including in the Russian town of Kozielsk near the city of Smolensk.\n\nGermany seized Smolensk from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941.\n\nOn April 13, 1943, German occupying forces announced the discovery of eight mass graves in a forest on the outskirts of the village of Katyn near Smolensk. The graves contained the remains of thousands of the Polish Army officers and intellectual leaders who had been interned in the Kozielsk prisoner-of-war camp. The Nazi regime blamed Soviet forces for the mass executions.\n\nAccording to records stored in the U.S. National Archives, Germany invited an international commission of medical experts, who excavated the graves in the spring of 1943 and concluded that the massacre occurred in 1940, when the area was under Soviet control.\n\nA few months later, in the fall of 1943, Soviet forces recaptured Smolensk, after which they conducted their own excavation and announced that the massacre occurred in 1941, when the region was under Nazi occupation. Soviet authorities subsequently blamed German forces for the killings.\n\nFor nearly five decades, until just before its own demise, the Soviet Union continued to deny responsibility for the Katyn massacre.\n\nOn April 13, 1990, the Soviet government released a statement to the state-owned news agency TASS accepting responsibility for the execution of 22,000 Poles, calling the massacre \u201cone of the most heinous crimes of Stalinism.\u201d\n\nOn April 28, 2010, Russia\u2019s then-President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the release of the \u201coriginal Katyn documents,\u201d including the lists of the executed and the execution orders.\n\nWhile the page where these NKVD archives were located still exists on the Russian government archives website, the documents themselves, which were designated \u201cDocuments on the \u2018problem of Katyn\u2019 from \u2018package 1\u2019,\u201d are no longer accessible.\n\nThe two plaques in Tver commemorating the Katyn massacre -- one in Russian, the other in Polish -- were placed on the fa\u00e7ade of the city\u2019s Medical University in 1991 and 1992 on the orders of the Tver city council. Until 1954, the building had housed the regional headquarters of the Soviet secret police. According to archival documents, more than 6,000 poles were tortured and killed in the building\u2019s basement.\n\nIn December 2019, the Tver prosecutor\u2019s office ordered that the Katyn plaques be removed from the Medical University building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade, claiming that the annual commemoration ceremonies posed \u201ca security threat to the students and the faculty.\u201d While insisting the order had \u201cno political background whatsoever,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s decree also stated that \u201cthe writings on the memorial plaques are not based on documented facts.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s return to the Soviet World War II historical narrative has been increasingly visible in the country\u2019s foreign policy, as well as in daily life at home. Experts say the rewriting of history and return to propaganda about the Soviet Union\u2019s great patriotic victory, including the glamorization of Stalin, has become key to Vladimir Putin\u2019s popularity.", "lang": "en"}
