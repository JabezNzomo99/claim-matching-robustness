{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did Charles Darwin Say, \u2018It Is Not The Strongest Or The Most Intelligent Who Will Survive\u2019?", "subtitle": "", "author": "checkyourfact.com", "date": "2019-07-08T14:11:33.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-46503", "url": "http://checkyourfact.com/2019/07/08/fact-check-charles-darwin-strongest-intelligent-survive-best-manage-change/", "vclaim": "An image shared on Facebook attributes the following quote to biologist Charles Darwin: \u201cIt is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Darwin ever said or wrote this statement.\n\nDarwin was a 19th century English scientist best known for his theory of evolution. In the 1859 book \u201cOn the Origins of Species,\u201d he expounded upon the process of natural selection, whereby organisms are more likely to survive and reproduce if they are well adapted to their environment.\n\nHowever, nowhere in that book, or in any of Darwin\u2019s writings, is the quote featured above to be found. A database of his collected works, Darwin Online, returned no matches, and the University of Cambridge\u2019s Darwin Correspondence Project includes a version of the quote on its list of \u201csix things Darwin never said.\u201d\n\nThe statement appears to have originated with a 1963 speech by a Louisiana State University professor named Leon C. Megginson, according to the website Quote Investigator.\n\nDuring that speech, Megginson states: \u201cAccording to Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species, it is not the most intellectual of the species that survives; it is not the strongest that survives; but the species that survives is the one that is able best to adapt and adjust to the changing environment in which it finds itself.\u201d\n\nThe quotation is Megginson\u2019s attempt at summarizing, in a digestible way, the primary tenet of the theory of evolution, but is not a direct quote from Darwin or his book \u201cOn the Origins of Species.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a known mechanism for the generation of misattributions,\u201d says Quote Investigator. \u201cPerson A summarizes, condenses, or restates the opinion of person B. At a later time the restatement is directly ascribed to person B.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
