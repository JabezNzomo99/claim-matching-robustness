For example, if the percentile score is 30, it suggests that the score is relatively better than 30% of the rest of the participants, but relatively lower than 70% of them.\n\nWhile Gandhi fares pretty badly in terms of debate participation and parliamentary presence with a percentile score of 27.3 and 5.2, respectively, when it comes to parliamentary questions, he is right at the bottom of the list with zero questions asked.\n\nCompared to Gandhi zero questions at the Lok Sabha, Irani stands at the 72nd percentile with 340 questions asked at the Rajya Sabha, while she was in the opposition. She also fares a lot better in terms of debate participation at 71st percentile, participating in 52 debates during the mentioned period.\n\nWhen it comes to attendance, Irani, at 27th percentile far outdoes Gandhi, who stands at a meagre percentile score of 5.\n\nBOOM concludes that the figures provided in the photo can actually be compared, despite reflecting different time periods, as they highlight Gandhi and Irani's performance as members of the opposition.", "lang": "en"}
