The missing ballots amount to nearly one in five of all absentee ballots and ballots mailed to voters residing in states that do elections exclusively by mail. States and local authorities simply have no idea what happened to these ballots since they were mailed \u2013 and the figure of 28 million missing ballots is likely even higher because some areas in the country, notably Chicago, did not respond to the federal agency\u2019s survey questions. This figure does not include ballots that were spoiled, undeliverable, or came back for any reason. Although there is no evidence that the millions of missing ballots were used fraudulently, the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which compiled the public data provided from the Election Assistance Commission, says that the sheer volume of them raises serious doubts about election security.\n\nThe headline and opening of the article, particularly in their use of the word \u201cmissing,\u201d left many readers with the impression that millions and millions of voters expected to receive ballots in the mail that mysteriously never arrived, or filled out and mailed in ballots that simply vanished without ever being counted.\n\nBut as the EAC observed in response, those 28 million \u201cmissing\u201d ballots were ones that were \u201cneither returned undeliverable nor returned from voter\u201d \u2014 in other words, ballots mailed out in multiple states over the course of four elections that were not marked and sent back. Declaring such ballots \u201cmissing\u201d is, as many others noted, akin to declaring all the millions of Americans who don\u2019t bother showing up at polling places each election (some 40 to 60% of the eligible voting population) as \u201cmissing\u201d:\n\nOr, as Pro Publica\u2019s Electionland quoted an expert on the subject:\n\nBut is it true, as RealClearPolitics claims, that \u201cThe potential to affect elections by chasing down unused mail-in ballots and make sure they get counted \u2013 using methods that may or may not be legal \u2013 is great\u201d and that \u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that as the number of mail-in ballots increases, so does fraud\u201d? As to the former point, the article stated up front that \u201cthere is no evidence that the millions of missing ballots were used fraudulently,\u201d and as to the latter point, the article offered nothing more than a link to an 8-year-old New York Times article about absentee voting. On the other hand, the National Vote at Home Institute (NVAIH) pointed out that methods for tracking mail-in ballots have become increasingly more widespread and sophisticated:\n\nWhat the article does not cover is that since voting by mailed-out ballot has become more prevalent, there are many best practices in use that prevent the sort of wide-scale ballot mishandling that Hemingway suggests. As election officials work to ensure that mailed ballots get to voters in the first place, jurisdictions now extensively partner with the USPS\u2019s National Change of Address (NCOA) program as well as ERIC (the Electronic Registration Information Center) to keep their voter address files current. Mailed-out ballots are non-forwardable, so there can\u2019t be millions of ballots floating around within the USPS. They are returned to the election office. Since voting by mailed-out ballot has become more prevalent, 36 states have instituted \u201cballot tracking\u201d where both the voter and election officials can see where the ballot is en route to and from the voter, just as you would [track] a package. If the ballot really does \u201cgo missing,\u201d the voter can be notified and obtain a new one. But the data shows ballot misplacement rarely happens in the way that Hemingway insinuates. In the high mailed-out ballot states, well over 50% of cast ballots are returned at secure ballot drop boxes or at staffed \u201cvote centers\u201d that look like traditional polling places, but without the lines.\n\nMore recent analysis of the vote-by-mail (VBM) process suggests that \u201cas with all forms of voter fraud, documented instances of fraud related to VBM are rare\u201d:\n\nAnother question surrounding VBM is whether it increases voter fraud. There are two major features of VBM that raise these concerns. First, the ballot is cast outside the public eye, and thus the opportunities for coercion and voter impersonation are greater. Second, the transmission path for VBM ballots is not as secure as traditional in-person ballots. These concerns relate both to ballots being intercepted and ballots being requested without the voter\u2019s permission. As with all forms of voter fraud, documented instances of fraud related to VBM are rare. However, even many scholars who argue that fraud is generally rare agree that fraud with VBM voting seems to be more frequent than with in-person voting.", "lang": "en"}
