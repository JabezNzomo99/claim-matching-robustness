Previously, it was when the child turned five.\n\nThis requirement only applies to a child\u2019s designated \u201clead parent\u201d. This means that, in a two-parent household in receipt of Universal Credit, the non-lead parent is expected to find work regardless of the child\u2019s age.\n\nThere is some evidence that the challenges in finding work \u201ccan be more acute\u201d for single parents. Three-year olds are not eligible to attend primary school, and single parents are therefore likely to be responsible for all the logistics of arranging childcare, alongside looking for work.\n\nAccording to data for the UK from 2014, 91% of single parents with dependent children were women. It was still around this level in 2017.\n\nWhat are the Universal Credit conditionality requirements?\n\nUniversal Credit is a working-age benefit that is replacing a lot of existing social security benefits like income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance and Housing Benefit. The government started rolling it out in 2013, and it is expected to be fully in place across the country by 2022.\n\nFor most claimants, their receipt of Universal Credit is conditional on meeting certain requirements. These largely relate to looking for work, or increasing your income from work.\n\nThere are also specific conditions for families with children. All children have a nominated \u201clead carer\u201d, and the age of the child affects what the lead carer has to do in order to receive Universal Credit.\n\nIf the child is aged under one, the lead carer doesn\u2019t have to look for work. Once the child turns one, the lead carer will be asked to attend \u201cwork focused interviews\u201d to \u201cdiscuss plans for a future move into work\u201d.\n\nOnce the child turns two, the lead carer has to \u201ctake active steps to prepare for work\u201d, \u201cwhich might include some training and work preparation activities\u201d.\n\nWhen the child turns three, the lead carer is expected to work (or look for work) for a maximum of 16 hours a week. At the age of five, this rises to a maximum of 25 hours a week, and from thirteen years old it rises to 35 hours a week.\n\nThe expectation that parents of three- and four-year olds look for work was introduced in April 2017. It was described by the charity Gingerbread (which works with single parent families) as \u201ca significant change in that it is the first time that parents of pre-school aged children must look for work or risk being exposed to sanctions\u201d.\n\nThe age at which a child\u2019s parent must find work if they are on various benefits has been decreasing: from 16 years old in 2008 to five years old by 2012.\n\nIn a two-parent household, the conditionality requirements based on the child\u2019s age only apply to the \u201clead carer\u201d. The other parent is expected to find work regardless of the child\u2019s age.\n\nGingerbread argues that the challenges in finding work \u201ccan be more acute\u201d for single parents, as they are likely to be responsible for all the logistics of dropping off and picking up a child from childcare, and childcare costs will take up a greater part of their income. Children in single-parent households are also around twice as likely to be in poverty as those in households with more than one adult, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).\n\nIn response to Ms Crawley\u2019s claim and question the government responded that \u201cIt is not until the youngest child in a family starts school that the job coach begins a conversation about the journey to work. It is not until the youngest child in a family is three that those conversations about getting into work begin to happen.\u201d A child can start reception class in England at age four, and must begin primary school from age five.\n\nParents of three- and four-year olds in England are normally entitled to between 15 and 30 hours of free childcare a week, depending on their circumstances, although the policy, introduced last September, has been criticised for involving extra costs for some parents.\n\n91% of single parents were women in 2014\n\nMs Crawley argues that the challenges for single parents will primarily affect women, as 91% of single parents are women.\n\nMs Crawley is referring to figures from 2014 published by the Office for National Statistics. In 2017, 90% of single parents with dependent children in the UK were women.\n\n21% of dependent children lived in single parent families in the UK in 2017\u2014virtually the same level as two decades before.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Budget Group, an independent network of researchers, policy experts and campaigners, has previously identified other ways in which women could be negatively affected by Universal Credit. For instance, it says that the practice of Universal Credit being a single monthly payment given to a couple could give abusive partners more opportunity to exert financial control over their partners.", "lang": "en"}
