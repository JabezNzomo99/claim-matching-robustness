Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic nominee for New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District seat, are pointing to a study they say shows \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d would save Americans money. But the author says their comments \u201cappear to reflect a misunderstanding of my study.\u201d\n\nThe study is based on the language of a \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d bill proposed by Sanders last year that makes assumptions about reduced administrative and drug costs, as well as deeply reduced reimbursement rates to health care providers under a universal health care system. But the study\u2019s author believes those assumptions about savings are unrealistic.\n\nOur fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post first wrote about this when, on July 30, Sanders tweeted, \u201cThank you, Koch brothers, for accidentally making the case for Medicare for All!\u201d\n\nIn the accompanying video, Sanders says, \u201cLet me thank the Koch brothers, of all people, for sponsoring a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez referenced the same study when asked by CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on Aug. 8 about the cost of \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the thing we need to realize is people talk about the sticker shock of Medicare-for-all. They do not talk about the sticker shock of our existing system,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cYou know in a Koch brothers-funded study \u2013 if any study is going to try to be a little bit slanted it would be one funded by the Koch brothers \u2013 it shows that Medicare-for-all is actually much cheaper than the current system that we pay right now.\u201d\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez are referring to a working paper, \u201cThe Costs of a National Single-Payer Healthcare System,\u201d published by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The Mercatus Center gets some of its funding from the libertarian Koch brothers, but more about that later.\n\nThe author of the paper, Charles Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center who once was the deputy director of President Bush\u2019s National Economic Council, says the two proponents of a universal health care system are distorting the findings of his paper.\n\nThe study looked at the impact of the Medicare for All Act introduced by Sanders on Sept. 13, 2017. The bill, which has 16 Democratic cosponsors, would expand Medicare into a universal health insurance program, phased in over four years. (The bill hasn\u2019t gone anywhere in a Republican-controlled Senate.)\n\nThe top line of the paper\u2019s abstract says that the bill \u201cwould, under conservative estimates, increase federal budget commitments by approximately $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years of full implementation.\u201d According to the paper, even doubling all \u201ccurrently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan.\u201d\n\nBut Sanders\u2019 spokesman, Josh Miller-Lewis, told us that presenting only the additional governmental cost of Medicare-for-all \u2014 \u201cthe scary $32 trillion figure\u201d \u2014 leaves out the larger context. Of course the government would spend more on health care under a Medicare-for-all system, he said, but the idea is that it would result in less spending on healthcare in the U.S. overall.\n\nMiller-Lewis referred to figures not highlighted in the report that show that between 2022 and 2031, the currently projected cost of health care expenditures in the U.S. of $59.4 trillion would dip to $57.6 trillion under the \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d plan. That\u2019s how Sanders arrives at his claim that the study \u201cshows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10 year period.\u201d (See Table 2.)\n\nIn an email to FactCheck.org, Blahous said he didn\u2019t highlight that figure because he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic.\n\nAs Blahous wrote in the fourth sentence of his abstract, \u201cIt is likely that the actual cost of M4A would be substantially greater than these estimates, which assume significant administrative and drug cost savings under the plan, and also assume that health care providers operating under M4A will be reimbursed at rates more than 40 percent lower than those currently paid by private health insurance.\u201d\n\nBlahous used the text of Sanders\u2019 bill to guide assumptions. For example, he said, the bill says health care providers will be reimbursed for patients at Medicare payment rates. Blahous said Medicare payment rates are projected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to be roughly 40 percent lower than those paid by private insurers, so he built those assumed savings into his estimate.\n\nBut in the report, Blahous cautions that the assumption is suspect.\n\nBlahous, July 2018: [I]t is not precisely predictable how hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare providers would respond to a dramatic reduction in their reimbursements under M4A, well below their costs of care for all categories of patients combined. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary has projected that even upholding current-law reimbursement rates for treating Medicare beneficiaries alone would cause nearly half of all hospitals to have negative total facility margins by 2040. The same study found that by 2019, over 80 percent of hospitals will lose money treating Medicare patients \u2014 a situation M4A would extend, to a first approximation, to all US patients. Perhaps some facilities and physicians would be able to generate heretofore unachieved cost savings that would enable their continued functioning without significant disruptions. However, at least some undoubtedly would not, thereby reducing the supply of healthcare services at the same time M4A sharply increases healthcare demand. It is impossible to say precisely how much the confluence of these factors would reduce individuals\u2019 timely access to healthcare services, but some such access problems almost certainly must arise. Anticipating these difficulties, some other studies have assumed that M4A payment rates must exceed current-law Medicare payment rates to avoid sending facilities into deficit on average or to avoid triggering unacceptable reductions in the provision and quality of healthcare services. These alternative payment rate assumptions substantially increase the total projected costs of M4A.\n\nOr, as Blahous told us via email, achieving a 40 percent reduction in reimbursement rates is an \u201cunlikely outcome\u201d and \u201cactual costs are likely to be substantially greater.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo argue that we can get to that level of savings by getting rid of the health insurance middleman is inconsistent with my study,\u201d Blahous said. \u201cTo lend credibility to the $2 trillion savings number specifically, one would have to argue that we can make those 40 percent cuts to providers at the same time as increasing demand by about 11 percent, without triggering disruptions of access to care that lawmakers and the public find unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe report similarly uses assumptions in the Sanders bill about savings on administrative costs and on the cost of prescription drugs. Blahous describes these assumptions as \u201caggressive\u201d and his report includes arguments that suggest they are unlikely.\n\nSaid Blahous: \u201cIf you ask somebody \u2018How much would something cost?\u2019 and if they responded with, \u2018Well, if you assume X the cost would be Y, but that\u2019s an unrealistic assumption, actual costs would be higher\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s not accurate to say \u2018He says the cost is Y!\u2019 When I wrote that \u2018actual costs\u2019 would be higher, I meant it. And I haven\u2019t simply said that in response to comments like the candidate\u2019s \u2013 I had previously put it front and center on the study itself.\u201d\n\nIn his report, Blahous provided an alternative-scenario estimate, one that assumed instead that payments to health care providers would \u201cremain equal on average to the current-law blend of higher private and lower public reimbursement rates.\u201d Under that scenario, there would be a net increase in health care spending.\n\nSanders\u2019 spokesman, Miller-Lewis, argues that the initial assumptions used in the report \u2014 the ones based on Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All Act \u2014 are legitimate.\n\nThe buying power associated with a system that represents all Americans would allow the government to negotiate significant savings in payments to health care providers, as well as on drug prices, Miller-Lewis said.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of universal health care is that you\u2019ll get these cost-savings,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s done everywhere in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re making any wrong assumptions.\u201d\n\nThere is a certain amount of guesswork in estimating the cost of something as complicated as the health care system, and all of those estimates rely on a multitude of assumptions. We\u2019re not suggesting the assumptions made in the Sanders bill are wrong, only that they aren\u2019t Blahous\u2019 assumptions.\n\n\u201cProponents are perfectly free to argue for those provider cuts and to say that believe M4A will therefore lower national health spending, \u2014 and also to cite whatever data they want in support of their arguments, from any study they find credible,\u201d Blahous told us. \u201cWhat they shouldn\u2019t say is that I also reached that conclusion, because that\u2019s incorrect. That finding should not be attributed to me or to my study.\u201d\n\nBoth Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez referred to the Mercatus Center report as a \u201cKoch brothers-funded study.\u201d They are referring, of course, to the billionaire brothers, Charles and David Koch, who spend hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Republican candidates that support their conservative/libertarian agenda.\n\nThe Koch brothers have donated millions of dollars to George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, and Charles Koch sits on the center\u2019s board of directors.\n\nDocuments published earlier this year show the Koch brothers, at one point at least, used their donations to gain influence over the hiring and firing of professors at the Mercatus Center. An Associated Press story about the donor agreement with the school noted, \u201cThe Koch Foundation issued a statement saying the agreements with Mason are \u2018old and inactive\u2019 and that newer agreements contain no such provisions.\u201d\n\nBlahous told us his work is not influenced by any donors to the Mercatus Center.\n\n\u201cAll I\u2019d say is that my research is totally my own,\u201d Blahous said. \u201cIt\u2019s academic research, it goes through a blind review process, and it represents my own work. I choose my own research subjects and follow the facts where they lead. You\u2019d have to ask someone else about where funding comes from, I don\u2019t follow that and it doesn\u2019t affect me.\u201d\n\nWe take no position on \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d and we can\u2019t say if Blahous\u2019 study is or is not influenced by donors to the Mercatus Center. But we can say that Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are misrepresenting the study\u2019s conclusions.\n\nClarification, Aug. 13, 2018: The first paragraph of this story was updated to include a quote from Charles Blahous, who said the comments made by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez \u201cappear to reflect a misunderstanding of my study.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
