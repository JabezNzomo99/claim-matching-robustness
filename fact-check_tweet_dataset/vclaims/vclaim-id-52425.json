While China's People Liberation Army too is said to have suffered casualties, China has not released any official word on the same.\n\nThe image was tweeted by Dr. Anand Rai, known for being one of the whistleblowers of the Vyapam scam in Madhya Pradesh. Rai tweeted with the caption, \"This is one of the soldiers who survived the barbaric attack by Chinese forces on galwan valley. He has nail injuries all over his body. They were completely unarmed and yet they fought back the Chinese army.\"\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nWe searched with the caption on Facebook and found the image shared with the same false claim.\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nAlso Read: No This Photo Is Not Of Indian Troops Killed In Galwan Valley\n\nWe performed a reverse image search using Yandex, a Russian search engine which showed results dating back to 2016.\n\nThe same image had been used in articles on several websites including Indonesian, Malaysian, and Thai.\n\nThe blogs on which the viral image was used on were mostly about rigorous training an aspiring soldier has to undergo in army camps. BOOM could not independently verify the image or where it is from, however we could establish that the image is not recent and is not related to the recent border clash between India and China.\n\nBOOM has debunked several pieces of misinformation post clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh on June 15-16.
