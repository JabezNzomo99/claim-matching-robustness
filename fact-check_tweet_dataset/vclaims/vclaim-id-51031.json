We have no shortage of impeachment offenses. This president is a criminal.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nSearching online and on the Nexis news archive we found no evidence that Pelosi said that.\n\nAnd while Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., warned that Trump would \"continue to try to cheat\" if the Senate didn\u2019t convict him, it doesn\u2019t appear that Pelosi vowed to impeach him again.\n\nOn Dec. 23, Politico reported that lawyers for the House Judiciary Committee said in a court filing that the House could impeach Trump again if it discovers new evidence that Trump tried to obstruct investigations into his actions.\n\nBut as this Feb. 6 Washington Post analysis notes, it could be too risky for the Democrats to try again.\n\n\"The political cost of being seen as relentlessly trying to get the president out of office, especially as the election ticks closer, is just too high,\" the story says.\n\nBack to the alleged Pelosi quote: We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
