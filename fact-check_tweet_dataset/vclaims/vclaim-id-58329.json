This is an evolving global conversation and we will continue to play our part in collaboration with experts and trusted authorities.\u201d\n\nEarlier in March, Twitter had broadened their policy guidance, widening their definition of harm to address and review content that went directly against guidance from authoritative sources of public health information. The platform had said that they would remove content which carried \u201ca clear call to action that could directly pose a risk to people\u2019s health or well-being,\u201d but said they would be unable to take action in cases of \u201cincomplete or disputed information about COVID-19\u201d.\n\nOn Monday, 11 May, the platform also began introducing labels and warning messages providing additional context and information on some tweets containing potentially harmful or misleading information related to COVID-19. These labels will link to a \u201cTwitter-curated page or external trusted source containing additional information on the claims made within the Tweet\u201d.\n\nThis followed close on the heels of another process of labelling tweets containing \"manipulated media\" with an aim to mislead people.", "lang": "en"}
