It doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe video was posted Jan. 7 and depicts a rapid succession of missiles or rockets being launched into the air.\n\n\"Footage of the second attack of misiles (sic) at the American base in Iran,\" the user wrote in their caption.\n\nThe video was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been viewed more than 15,000 times.\n\nSetting aside the fact that it shows far more missiles than the Pentagon said Iran launched, the video is older than Jan. 7.\n\nWe found the video on YouTube as early as November 2018. Other videos claimed it shows a Russian military exercise. While we could not independently confirm the origin of the video, the style of shooting depicted is consistent with other rocket launchers Russia has tested.\n\nRegardless, the Facebook video does not show Iran\u2019s strike in Iraq. Below is some footage Iran released after the attack, in which there were no reported casualties.\n\nThe Facebook posts are inaccurate. We rate them False.", "lang": "en"}
