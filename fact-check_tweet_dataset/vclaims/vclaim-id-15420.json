Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: In an American survey, Modi is the only Indian to be included in the \u2018Top 50 Honest Leaders Ranking\u2019 and also, he topped that list. Fact: There is no such ranking in the world and also, no official source has written anything about it. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for Modi ranking in the various rankings published across the world, it was found that many organizations have ranked him in their surveys but the survey quoted in the post has not been found. Some of the surveys where Modi has been ranked are \u2018Forbes Powerful People\u2019, \u2018Gallup International \u2013 Opinion of Global Leaders\u2019, \u2018Most followed on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter\u2019, and\n\n \u2018Bloomberg Markets Most Influential Rankings\u2019.\n\nGenerally, when the Prime Minister of India wins any award in other countries it is reported by the Press Information Bureau (PIB), the official public relations wing of the government. But there is no such information on the survey quoted in the post. Also, when searched for the \u2018Honest Indian Political Leader\u2019 on Google, it can be found that similar posts are made on Manmohan Singh in the past, which are debunked by the other fact checkers.\n\nFinally, there is no such survey on Honest Leaders which placed Modi as the most honest political leader.", "lang": "en"}
