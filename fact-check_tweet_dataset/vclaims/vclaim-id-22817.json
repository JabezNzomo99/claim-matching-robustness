The origins of the saying are unknown, but it is often falsely attributed to Churchill.\n\nA public figure for much of his life, Churchill\u2019s public statements and writings are well preserved. Churchill was a prolific writer, authoring a great number of books, articles and speeches.\n\nHowever, in all of the literature written about or by Churchill, this quote does not appear anywhere. The International Churchill Society, which partnered with George Washington University to establish the National Churchill Library and Center, does not list the expression on its page of Churchill quotes.\n\nRichard M. Langworth, a senior fellow at Hillsdale College\u2019s Churchill Project, even includes the quote on his list of \u201cAll The \u2018Quotes\u2019 Winston Church Never Said.\u201d\n\nChurchill, at one time a journalist and solider, also served in a variety of government roles over his long career, starting with his 1900 election to the Parliament. In what he called \u201cwalking with destiny,\u201d Churchill was appointed prime minister in 1940 against the backdrop of the Second World War.", "lang": "en"}
