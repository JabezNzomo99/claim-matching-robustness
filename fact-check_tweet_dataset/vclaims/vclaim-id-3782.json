We haven\u2019t been able to look at the case for Scotland and Northern Ireland here.\n\nYou can\u2019t buy a house yourself until you\u2019re 18, because in general you can\u2019t legally enter into a contract until that age. People under 18 can still have an \u2018estate in land\u2019 owned in trust by a trustee. According to the House of Commons Library:\n\n\u201cAt 18 an individual has complete contractual capacity; they can make binding contracts in their own right. They can own land, buy a house or flat, hold a tenancy or apply for a mortgage. They will also become entitled to any property that has been held in trust for them.\u201d\n\nYou may also have certain rights to being housed by your local authority if you\u2019re under 18. Local authorities usually have to secure housing for unintentionally homeless 16 and 17 year-olds, and you can also get help if you\u2019re under 16 and having serious problems at home.\n\nYou can legally get married, or enter into a civil partnership at 16, although parental consent must be given in both cases if you are under the age of 18.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously summarised some of the key legal age limits in England and Wales.\n\nIf the issues in this article are relevant to you and you\u2019re looking for advice about your own circumstances wherever you are in the UK, you can contact Citizens Advice.", "lang": "en"}
