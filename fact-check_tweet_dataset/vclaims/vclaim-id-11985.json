The story mostly regurgitates details from a story on another site \u2018intended for entertainment purposes only\u2019, but it is presented without a disclaimer. It is not possible for a woman to give birth to a dog.\n\nThis link from April 4, 2017 has been shared on Facebook 3,227 times and details a story about how a German tourist surprised doctors at a Western Cape hospital by giving birth to three puppies.\n\nThe article appears on the official website of a DJ based in South Africa, which links to a Twitter account with more than 70,000 followers and Facebook account with over 40,000 followers.\n\nIt is not clear what animal is in the photo. A Google reverse search of the image shows articles from Malaysia in April 2016 - about a goat born with human-like features. The Malaysian Veterinary Department did not immediately respond to confirm the pictured animal was tested by them.\n\nA google search of the headline leads to an article from February 25, 2016 that reads: \u201cWoman Gives Birth To Puppies After Admitting To Sex With Family Dog\u201d, supposedly in Utah, United States.\n\nIt was posted on Empire News a site that carries a disclaimer for the content it posts: \u201cEmpire News is intended for entertainment purposes only.\u201d\n\nThe same text as on the DJ's website is picked up and posted with a video on YouTube with more than 29,000 views. That shows images of silicone dolls in the form of characters from James Cameron's Avatar movie and resembling those found on this website.\n\nIt is impossible for a woman to give birth to a dog.\n\n\u201cAll animals carry DNA which is the genetic instructions which inform development, growth and functioning of the body. The DNA code is unique to every species,\u201d explained Tabitha Haw, lecturer and genetic counsellor at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\n\u201cAs both the human mother and father have human DNA code, they will have a human baby. They are not able to produce a different species of animal such as dog or goat because they do not carry the DNA code for dog or goat in their egg/sperm.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
