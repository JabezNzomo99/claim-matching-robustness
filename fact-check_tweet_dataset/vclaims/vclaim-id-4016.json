No, that's nonsense peddled by an unreliable website that likes to copy paste together bits and pieces of articles from other websites and then adds unsupported facts in the headline and first paragraphs to make it more juicy in order to get clicks, traffic and ad revenue.\n\nThe CIA hoax originated from an article published on April 29, 2018 by YourNewsWire titled \"Snopes Finally Exposed As CIA Operation\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsing Snopes as a trusted authority is dangerous. According to a recent investigation, the so-called fact-checking organization is actually a front for the CIA. According to investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, Snopes was formed by the Central Intelligence Agency in order to spread disinformation on the internet, and stifle subversive outlets. Fellowshipoftheminds.com reports: From Madsen's for-subscribers-only report of Oct. 7, 2016, 'Snopes.com: the latest CIA addition to Internet disinformation':\n\nOK, if a 2016 article from a website run by one guy counts as \"a recent investigation\" there might be something there. Unfortunately it is behind a paywal. Lucky for us a different site seems to have a copy of the article which YourNewsWire quotes extensively.\n\nSnopes's most recent dissembling of the truth was to discount reports from Greece that Turkey has been shipping weapons disguised as furniture shipments to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and affiliated terrorist groups in North Africa and Europe. Snopes claims that because the story of a Greek Coast Guard interception of a weapons shipment south of the island of Crete dates from 2015, there is no validity to the Turkish connection to weapons shipments to ISIL terrorists.\n\nWhat Snopes was debunking was the claim the weapons were headed for refugee camps in Europe:\n\nIf anything, Snopes was actually confirming the weapons are being sent from Turkey to Libya in 2015, where ISIL was active since at least 2014:\n\nSomehow according to the article quoted by YourNewsWire, Snopes confirming weapons being smuggled from Turkey to Libya instead of to refugee camps in Europe means they are 'throwing cold water' on these links:\n\nThey could just as easily have refused to debunk the refugee story instead of, you know, confirming the actual smuggling to Libya. But somehow this \"proves\" they are a CIA front? Yeah, we don't know how that would work either.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Israel Did NOT Drop Tactical Nuclear Bomb On Syria\n\u2022 Fake News: 'Smallville' Star Did NOT Confess She Sold Children To Rothschilds And Clintons\n\u2022 Fake News: Superstar DJ Avicii Found Dead But Did NOT Expose Pedophile Ring\n\u2022 Fake News: 'Smallville' Actress Faces 15 Years But NOT For Providing Kids To Hollywood Pedos\n\u2022 Fake News: US Surgeon Found Dead Did NOT Expose Clinton Foundation Corruption In Haiti", "lang": "en"}
