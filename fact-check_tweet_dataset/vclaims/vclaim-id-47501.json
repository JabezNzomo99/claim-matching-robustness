We have been unable to find evidence to support this claim.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) failed to substantiate the claim made by Matt Hanock on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain when we asked them.\n\nThe Home Office has told Full Fact that it didn\u2019t recognise the figure used by Mr Hancock and believed it was wrong, but wasn\u2019t able to provide any alternative estimates when we asked for them.\n\nWhen we questioned several government departments about the figures, no one was able to provide an answer for where they came from. The DHSC did not respond to our questions.\n\nData on how many people are arriving at the UK\u2019s airports is hard to come by. We\u2019ve no reason to dismiss the Health Secretary\u2019s figure out of hand, but until the government can explain why Mr Hancock said what he did, we\u2019ve no good reason to put any weight in the figure he gave either.\n\nAirports have seen a collapse in demand\n\nWe spoke to Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester Airports Group and none would provide specific data on daily passenger numbers, with some mentioning this could be commercially sensitive.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Mr Hancock\u2019s figure does use data provided directly by airports.\n\nAnecdotally, it was clear that passenger numbers had fallen to a small fraction of their usual levels.\n\nHeathrow Airport\u2014which usually accounts for over a quarter of all passengers at UK airports\u2014normally sees about 6.5 million passengers in March, but this year that had fallen by over half to three million.\n\nHeathrow has released a forecast saying it expects passenger demand in April to fall by 90% compared to the previous year\u2014which would imply monthly passenger numbers in the region of 680,000, or between 20,000 and 25,000 a day (although some of these will be transfers and departures). This is just telling us about April as a whole, rather than recent days specifically.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing concrete enough here to tell us very much about Mr Hancock\u2019s claim, but it seems plausible that his figures resemble the scale of what\u2019s happening.\n\nWho is still travelling and why?\n\nMost airports release passenger data on a monthly basis, so by the middle of next month we\u2019ll have a clearer picture of the overall number of passengers at airports since the start of April.\n\nAs for the reasons why, airports told us that passengers were not travelling for holidays, and said flights were still generally open for essential travel for key workers, repatriation flights and cargo.\n\n\u201cAll of our terminals remain open on a scaled down basis as we help with the repatriation of British citizens and the transport of vital air cargo. Vital medical equipment and supplies, including ventilators and medicines, as well as food are being flown via Heathrow, helping to combat the impacts of the global pandemic\u201d.\n\nThe real trouble will be learning how many people are arriving in the UK for each reason, as the usual means of doing this\u2014the International Passenger Survey\u2014has been suspended in light of the pandemic.\n\nIn the absence of this data, there is still some information on the reasons for travel.\n\nThe volume of repatriations to the UK alone will have been significant in recent weeks.\n\nOn 23 March, when the lockdown began, the government advised all British travellers to return to the UK. To get a sense of the scale of that undertaking, the average number of UK residents on overnight stays abroad on any given day was about 1.6 million (based on the latest data from January to March 2018).\n\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed to us that since the outbreak began, it estimates over 1.3 million people have returned to the UK via commercial routes. It said as well as helping to keep air traffic routes open, it has brought back over 13,200 people on 63 flights it has organised, and assisted 19,000 cruise ship passengers\u2019 return.\n\nCargo flights have also increased to fill some of the gaps left by falls in passenger demand. Heathrow alone says it has seen a 200% increase in cargo-only flights per week.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics, which runs the International Passenger Survey, told us it was working on finding alternative sources of data for information on the reasons people are travelling, such as exit checks data gathered by the Home Office or administrative data from the Department for Work and Pensions.", "lang": "en"}
