Part of that \u2026 could involve setting up or sponsoring a primary school in a more low-income area that feeds the grammar school, so that it absolutely reaches into some of those \u200bcommunities that we want to benefit most from the good or outstanding grammars that are established\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s consultation document on the new proposals confirms that it intends to require grammar schools to reach out to improve the education of pupils from all backgrounds.\n\nOne option is that new selective grammar schools would have to: \u201cEstablish a primary feeder in an area with higher density of lower income households to widen access\u201d\n\nAt the moment, these are only proposals.\n\nAnd, as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s question highlights, we don\u2019t actually know how they would work in practice.\n\nAt the moment, schools that don\u2019t wholly use selection are allowed to name \u2018feeder schools\u2019 as one of the criteria for handling over-subscription. If too many parents apply, the school can take into account the primary school attended by the pupil when deciding who to admit.\n\nIf new grammar schools are forced to select some of their pupils from feeder schools in poorer areas, it could mean that what we currently know about the relationship between grammar schools and social mobility won\u2019t necessarily apply.\n\nPupils\u2019 backgrounds are a big part of what makes grammar schools different to other schools, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Pupils attending grammar schools are more likely to have attended less deprived primary schools, and more likely to have attended faith schools.\n\nGrammar schools also cast their net much wider than other schools, with their pupils coming from more than twice as many primary schools as non-selective schools.\n\nSince we don\u2019t know the extent of the government\u2019s new plans, it isn\u2019t possible to tell how much they could change the social makeup of the grammar schools we know.\n\nIf new rules do change the social makeup of grammar schools significantly, research about past or current grammar schools might not be a good guide to how new selective schools would affect social mobility.", "lang": "en"}
