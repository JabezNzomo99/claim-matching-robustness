The claim, however, is false. The image shows a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculpture by the artist Ewart Schindler.\n\nExamples are visible here and here . The claims purport that the image shows Mordrake\u2019s actual skull, when in fact, this was an art project inspired by the mystical character. The images also claim that Mordrake was born around 1890, with \u201ca second face on the back of his head,\u201d which he allegedly begged doctors to remove. After they refused, Mordrake purportedly committed suicide, at age 23. This is an old, urban legend ( here ). It was documented in The Boston Post newspaper as far back as December 1895 ( here ).\n\nThere are a number of alternate versions to this apocryphal story, which vary in their descriptions of the second face Mordrake is said to have possessed ( here ). Mordrake was also the subject of a two-part episode of the television show American Horror Story in 2014 ( here ).\n\nIn 2015, an historian at The Museum of Hoaxes argued that the story was a 19th century literary creation that had little scientific plausibility ( here , here ).\n\nAccording to Newsweek, the image on social media does not show the mummified skull of Mordrake, but a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculpture created by the artist Ewart Schindler ( here ). \u201cI was surprised to see that no one had done a Mordrake, so I thought I'd have a go at that,\u201d Schindler told Newsweek.\n\nSome of Schindler\u2019s work is visible online here . The Mordrake sculpture, as well as the artist responding to users\u2019 comments, is visible here .\n\nFalse. Image of two-faced mummified head shows papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculpture, not the skull of a subject of urban legends, Edward Mordrake.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
