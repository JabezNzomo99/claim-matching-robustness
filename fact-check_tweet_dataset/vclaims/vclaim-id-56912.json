All necessary precautions were taken by the workers during the food distribution process. Congress workers made sure social distance was maintained among people while collecting food. The weaker section of society is facing major hardships during the nationwide lockdown.\u2019\n\nHence, the above information proves that while the video of Congress volunteers serving food to the needy was related to COVID-19 but the other video of the person eating waste food is old and unrelated.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
