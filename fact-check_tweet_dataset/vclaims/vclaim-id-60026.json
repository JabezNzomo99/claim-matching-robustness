As the taxes are recounted, the video\u2019s narrator issues a brief warning to voters about Pepper\u2019s solution after voters rejected a tax hike he pushed.\n\n \n\n \"When Pepper's tax was finally voted down, Pepper laid off cops, and closed jails and let criminals run free in the streets,\" the video\u2019s narrator said.\n\n \n\n We found facts to back up Yost\u2019s statement, but the underlying message that Pepper negligently endangered the public is misleading.\n\n \n\n Pepper is judged here on two votes he made as one of three Hamilton County commissioners: One in favor of a tax hike and another in approval of the county\u2019s 2009 budget.\n\n \n\n Pepper and another commissioner, without a vote of the people, raised the sales tax in 2007 to pay for a \"comprehensive safety plan,\" which called for a new jail and holding steady the number of deputies patrolling the streets. The third commissioner voted against the tax hike. Voters later followed suit, rejecting the tax increase when petitioners forced it on the ballot.\n\n \n\n Yost\u2019s video makes no mention that \"Pepper\u2019s tax\" was an attempt to boost public safety.\n\n \n\n Hamilton County, without any money for a new jail, continued to pay rent at other correctional facilities. The economy worsened over the next year, and commissioners realized they would have to slash budgets in 2009. The sheriff\u2019s budget was slashed 16 percent, from 74.8 million to 62.8 million.\n\n \n\n The cut forced 165 layoffs, including 24 patrol officers, closed the Queensgate Correctional Facility and resulted in more prisoners getting released before their sentence ended. All of these consequences were laid out before Pepper and the other commissioners unanimously approved the budget.\n\n \n\n Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis, a Republican who\u2019s held the job for more than 20 years, had the final say on how to spend his budget. He said there was no choice but to close the jail and lay off workers. He would not blame Pepper because he tried to pay for a new jail and keep police on the street by temporarily raising the sales tax. Voters also rejected a tax levy for a new jail in 2006, before Pepper became a county commissioner.\n\n \n\n \"The voters had two chances to solve the problem, and they turned it down both times,\" Leis said in a phone interview.\n\n \n\n The fact remains, however, that Pepper voted in favor of a county budget he knew would reduce the sheriff\u2019s staff and shutter an 822-bed jail at a time when prisoner overcrowding already was a longtime problem.\n\n \n\n Early releases of prisoners spiked to 501 in 2009 after Queensgate was closed in late 2008. The county saw 143 early releases in 2008 and 106 in 2007, according to the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\n \n\n So there\u2019s no doubt the county budget Pepper approved resulted in laid off cops, the shuttering of a prison and more criminals on the street.\n\n \n\n But Yost\u2019s claim exaggerates Pepper\u2019s role in the matter. And it says Pepper closed multiple jails, when only one was closed as a result of the 2009 budget.\n\n \n\n Each commissioner\u2019s vote carries equal weight, yet the video solely blames Pepper for the actions of the entire board, made of two Democrats and one Republican. Solely blaming Pepper also excuses the sheriff, who ultimately decides how to spend the money commissioners allot him.\n\n \n\n And the county\u2019s hand was forced when voters rejected the 2007 tax increase to fund public safety.\n\n \n\n We rate the statement Barely True.", "lang": "en"}
