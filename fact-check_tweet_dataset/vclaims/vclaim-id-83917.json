The incident occurred on August 20, 2018 and was triggered by the death of a 19-year old boy Bimlesh Sao, whose body was found on a railway track at Bihiya town, Bhojpur. A mob from the deceased\u2019s village in Damodarpur took to vandalising and burning local shops following his death. They alleged that the youth was strangled and later thrown on the railway tracks as a cover-up. The mob also alleged that a few houses near the railway tracks were involved in prostitution and alleged that locals living there were involved in the boy\u2019s death as he reportedly had given information on a sex racket to the police. Later, they vandalised and set on fire the houses near the railway tracks and dragged a woman living there out on to the street, assaulted, disrobed and paraded her.", "lang": "en"}
