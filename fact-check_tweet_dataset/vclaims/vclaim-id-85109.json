Under profiling, law enforcement officers target people based on their race or ethnicity or other factors on the grounds that certain minority groups are more likely to commit crimes.\n\nOddly, as our colleagues at PolitiFact found, Trump has also falsely claimed that he never said he wanted to profile Muslims, just \u201cpeople that maybe look suspicious.\u201d Trump also approvingly cites Israeli policies, which appears to allow for the profiling of Arabs, but Israel, a much smaller country, has a serious problem with Palestinian terrorism. (Update: Israel\u2019s methods are actually more sophisticated than ethnic profiling but relies instead on behavior patterns, according to an article in the Times of Israel titled \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t do ethnic profiling the way Trump thinks it does.\u201d)\n\nFirst of all, if someone is carrying what looks like \u201ca massive bomb\u201d on their back, police are going to ask questions. There is no need for profiling in the first place. There is a clear basis for approaching a person who appears to be carrying a bomb, no matter what the ethnicity, religion or race.\n\nIf there is just a person with a backpack, and no credible information suggesting such a threat was unfolding in a particular area, it would be more difficult to make the case that a person must be stopped because they appear to be from a particular ethnic group. But presumably that\u2019s not what Trump is talking about. (As usual, his campaign did not respond to a query for an explanation of his remarks.)\n\nAs the Congressional Research Service noted in a 2012 report, the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure, and the 14th Amendment, allowing for equal protection under the law, have led to court rulings that have limited the use of profiling against racial and ethnic groups. However, exceptions have developed.\n\nIn 2001, shortly after taking office and before the Sept. 11 attacks, Bush ordered a review by the Justice Department on how to end racial profiling. In 2003, Bush issued a ban on the practice by federal agencies \u2013 with the exception of using profiling to combat terrorism and to screen airline passengers and people at border crossings and immigration checkpoints.\n\nIn 2014, Obama issued his own policy, broadening the definition of racial profiling to include such characteristics as sexual orientation and gender identity. But he kept the carve-out to combat terrorist threats, screen airline passengers and people at border crossings and immigration checkpoints.\n\nSo a listed characteristic cannot be used by a police officer as a factor to pull over a car. But there are three factors that can allow the use of generalized stereotypes:\n\nAs usual, Trump\u2019s actual policy position is a bit of fog. He denies he wants to profile Muslims, while at the same time says the model for the United States should be Israel. (Wink, wink.)\n\nBut Trump also wrongly claims that that the United States does not allow profiling. In fact, profiling is permitted to screen airline passengers and immigrants \u2013 and law enforcement can use it to combat terrorist threats. From the context of his remarks, those are the situations that he is describing when he says profiling is not permitted. We wavered between Three Pinocchio and Four Pinocchios, but ultimately tipped to Four, given the inability of his staff to explain what he has in mind.", "lang": "en"}
