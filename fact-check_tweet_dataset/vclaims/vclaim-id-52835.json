{"title": "Did a Craigslist Ad Seek 'Minority Actors' for Trump's Tulsa Rally?", "subtitle": "Twitter sleuths connected a Craigslist ad for paid minority actors to an upcoming Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-06-15T11:58:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-52835", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/craigslist-minority-actors-trump-tulsa/", "vclaim": "On June 15, 2020, a screenshot of an actual Craigslist advertisement seeking \u201cExcited and enthusiastic MINORITY Actors and Actresses\u201d to \u201chold signs\u201d at an event in Tulsa, Oklahoma began to make the rounds on social media.\n\nTwitter users attempted to make the connection that the ad was hiring minorities to work at President Donald Trump\u2019s upcoming rally, which was re-scheduled for June 20, 2020, after it was originally planned for Juneteenth, a day commemorated as the end of slavery in the United States. The announcement of the rally\u2019s location also sparked controversy because Tulsa was the site of the 1921 massacre of hundreds of Black people by a white mob.\n\nThe ad also placed the location for the gig at \u201cThird St near Denver Ave,\u201d which is across the street from the Bok Center where Trump\u2019s rally will be held. The ad also offered $10 as compensation, but it\u2019s unclear whether that amount is hourly, or for one day of work.\n\nWhile many factors connect the ad to the location and date of the Trump rally, Snopes is unable to contact the original source for the ad, and thus can\u2019t determine whether this was an attempt to hire actors with minority backgrounds to hold up signs at the rally.\n\nThe ad was taken down by Craigslist administrators on June 15, 2020. Snopes was unable to contact the person who posted the ad, but has contacted Craigslist for comment, and will update this post if we receive a response.\n\nAs of June 15, the page said \u201cThis posting is being held for review.\u201d On June 16, it was flagged for removal, presumably for a terms of use violation:\n\nSocial media posts calling out supposed Craigslist ads that solicit paid actors to show up as supporters frequently pop up before Trump rallies. Snopes identified one from November 2019 as \u201cUnproven.\u201d We also investigated others from July 2016 and August 2017 that were rated \u201cUnproven,\u201d and one from October 2018 we rated as \u201cFalse.\u201d\n\nSince we are unable to prove whether the Craigslist ad seeking minority actors and actresses is in any way connected to the Trump rally being held on the same date, we rate this claim \u201cUnproven.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
