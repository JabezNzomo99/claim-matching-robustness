The decline in the rial, the national currency, has been attributed to economic mismanagement and the impact of President Trump\u2019s decision to renounce the nuclear agreement. Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times\n\n\u201cEconomically, we see how the regime\u2019s decision to prioritize an ideological agenda over the welfare of the Iranian people has put Iran into a long-term economic tailspin. During the time of the nuclear deal, Iran\u2019s increased oil revenues could have gone to improving the lives of the Iranian people. Instead they went to terrorists, dictators, and proxy militias. Today, thanks to regime subsidies, the average Hezbollah combatant makes two to three times what an Iranian firefighter makes on the streets of Iran. Regime mismanagement has led to the rial plummeting in value. A third of Iranian youth are unemployed, and a third of Iranians now live below the poverty line.\u201d Iran used at least some earnings from oil, including money impounded by sanctions but released when the nuclear deal took effect in 2016, to fill deficiencies in its budget. Iran also spent enormous sums to attract investment, buy and refurbish airplanes and ships, and provide financing to stimulate the economy. The decline in the rial, the national currency, has been attributed by economists not only to mismanagement but to the negative impact of President Trump\u2019s decision to renounce the nuclear agreement in May and restore the sanctions. Mr. Pompeo\u2019s basis for the wage comparison of Hezbollah fighters and Iranian firefighters is unclear. While youth unemployment in Iran is widely believed to be at least 30 percent, that figure is comparable to or below that of other countries in the Middle East as well as Spain and Italy. On Iran\u2019s poverty rate, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertion is disputed. A 2016 World Bank working paper suggested it was less than 10 percent, according to Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a Brookings Institution scholar who participated in the research. \u201cThe bitter irony of the economic situation in Iran is that the regime uses this same time to line its own pockets while its people cry out for jobs and reform and for opportunity. The Iranian economy is going great \u2013 but only if you\u2019re a politically-connected member of the elite. Two years ago, Iranians rightfully erupted in anger when leaked paystubs showed massive amounts of money inexplicably flowing into the bank accounts of senior government officials.\u201d Mr. Pompeo was correct that corruption in Iran\u2019s government is pervasive, a fact that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has acknowledged. Mr. Pompeo was also correct in describing the popular anger that erupted over the leaked paystubs \u2014 but did not mention that some officials had leaked the information and that Mr. Rouhani ordered an investigation into the pay, which entangled associates that included his own brother.\n\n\u201cTake Sadeq Larijani, the head of Iran\u2019s judiciary. He is worth at least $300 million dollars. He got this money from embezzling public funds into his own bank account. The Trump administration sanctioned Larijani in January for human rights abuses, because we aren\u2019t afraid to tackle the regime at its highest level. Call me crazy \u2014 you won\u2019t be the first \u2014 but I\u2019m a little skeptical that a thieving thug under international sanctions is the right man to be Iran\u2019s highest-ranking judicial official.\u201d The basis for Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertions about Mr. Larijani\u2019s supposed wealth and how he obtained it is unclear. But human rights activists corroborate Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertion that Mr. Larijani is complicit in rights violations. \u201cAs head of the judiciary he is certainly a leading human rights abuser,\u201d said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group. \u201cFormer I.R.G.C. officer and Minister of Interior Sadeq Mahsouli is nicknamed \u2018the Billionaire General.\u2019 He went from being a poor I.R.G.C. officer at the end of the Iran-Iraq war to being worth billions of dollars. How\u2019d that happen? He somehow had a knack for winning lucrative construction and oil trading contracts from businesses associated with the I.R.G.C. Being an old college buddy of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad just might have had something to do with it as well.\u201d Mr. Pompeo\u2019s description of Mr. Mahsouli and his relationship with Mr. Rouhani\u2019s predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, have been corroborated by rights advocates, including the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center, a rights group based in New Haven, Conn. \u201cAnd not many people know this, but the Ayatollah Khamenei has his own personal, off-the-books hedge fund called the Setad, worth $95 billion, with a B. That wealth is untaxed, it is ill-gotten, and it is used as a slush fund for the I.R.G.C. The ayatollah fills his coffers by devouring whatever he wants. In 2013 the Setad\u2019s agents banished an 82-year-old Baha\u2019i woman from her apartment and confiscated the property after a long campaign of harassment. Seizing land from religious minorities and political rivals is just another day at the office for this juggernaut that has interests in everything from real estate to telecoms to ostrich farming. All of it is done with the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei.\u201d A 2013 investigative series by Reuters provided details about Setad and its evolution into one of the most powerful organizations in Iran. Mr. Pompeo appeared to be partly quoting from the Reuters account, which called Setad \u201ca business juggernaut that now holds stakes in nearly every sector of Iranian industry, including finance, oil, telecommunications, the production of birth-control pills and even ostrich farming.\u201d \u201cJust earlier this month, an Iranian \u2018diplomat\u2019 based in Vienna was arrested and charged with supplying explosives for a terrorist bomb scheduled to bomb a political rally in France. This tells you everything you need to know about the regime: At the same time they\u2019re trying to convince Europe to stay in the nuclear deal, they\u2019re covertly plotting terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe.\u201d A number of people of Iranian origin were arrested and charged in Europe in early July in connection with what investigators called a foiled plot to bomb a rally in France. The suspects included an Iranian diplomat in Vienna who was described as a contact person. Mr. Pompeo did not mention that the rally had been for an exiled Iranian opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, which is unpopular in Iran. It advocates the overthrow of Iran\u2019s government and for years was on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations but was removed in 2012 after intense lobbying efforts. \u201cIn response to myriad government failures, corruption, and disrespect of rights, since December Iranians have been taking to the streets in the most enduring and forceful protests since 1979. Some shout the slogan, \u201cThe people are paupers while the mullahs live like gods.\u201d Others choose to shut down the Grand Bazaar in Tehran. The specific grievances do differ, but all those voicing dissatisfaction share one thing: They have been ill-treated by a revolutionary regime. Iranians want to be governed with dignity, accountability, and respect.\u201d Mostly true but one inaccuracy. The protests pale in comparison to the enormous demonstrations and rallies that followed Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s suspiciously lopsided victory in the 2009 election. Millions of Iranians demanded a recount for their candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, who was considered far more moderate than Mr. Ahmadinejad.", "lang": "en"}
