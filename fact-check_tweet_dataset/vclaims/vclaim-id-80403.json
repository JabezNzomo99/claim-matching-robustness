The image was shared by satire Twitter handle 'Aisi Taisi Democracy' and filmmaker Rakesh Sharma.\n\nHowever, on viewing the video of the entire speech it is clear that neither Nitin Gadkari or Dr. Harsh Vardhan were asleep at the time. The Lok Sabha clock clearly visible in the photo shows the time as 11:03 am. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was scheduled to deliver the budget at 11 am; which means the screenshot was taken during the first few minutes of Jaitley's speech.\n\nBOOM examined the video and found that Nitin Gadkari leaned to his side while looking down while Dr. Harsh Vardhan blinked while applauding. The person seated behind Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore seems to be preoccupied with his phone. (Watch the clip below)\n\nWhile BOOM could not find @AisiTaisiDemo's tweet, which seems to have been deleted; Rakesh Sharma apologized and deleted his tweet after BOOM pointed it out.", "lang": "en"}
