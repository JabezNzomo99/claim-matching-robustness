The former Prez and First Lady have been renting the house this summer and loved it so much, we\u2019ve learned they made an offer. The property is listed at $14,850,000. Our sources say they\u2019re paying less, but we don\u2019t know how much.\n\nThe details of the potential sale were not made public at the time and, as TMZ reported, \u201cit\u2019s not a done deal just yet. We\u2019re told there are contingencies so it\u2019s possible it could fall apart.\u201d The property in question in the affluent Massachusetts community was listed at just shy of $15 million and does have waterfront access.\n\nAs of Sept. 6, 2019, no sales report of the purchase had been logged with the Dukes County Registry of Deeds. We reached out to the Obama family press office to inquire about the status of the transaction but have not received a response. All major reporting on the topic, at that point, stemmed from TMZ\u2019s \u201cmultiple island sources.\u201d Neither the realtors nor representatives for Grousbeck provided statements to the news media.\n\nIn December 2019, the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Gazette reported that the sale had been completed and that the new deedholder is a nominee trust representing the Obamas:\n\nFormer President Obama and his family are now permanent homeowners on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, after completing the purchase this week of a large home situated on nearly 30 acres in the coastal perimeter of Edgartown. The purchase price, recorded at 3:31 p.m. Wednesday with the Dukes County Registry of Deeds, is listed at $11.75 million. The buyer is a nominee trust representing the former First Family. The sellers are Wycliffe Grousbeck and Corinne Basler Grousbeck. Mr. Grousbeck is a private equity investor and owner of the Boston Celtics basketball team.\n\nThe deed lists the buyer as \u201cJames F. Reynolds, as trustee of The 79 Turkeyland Cove Road Nominee Trust.\u201d Multiple news reports have identified Reynolds as a longtime friend of the former first family, but none of the documents available through the Dukes Country Registry of Deeds mention the Obamas by name.\n\nAs such, as of this writing we are unable to independently verify the claim that the Obamas purchased the property. If further details of the transaction come to light, we will update this page accordingly.", "lang": "en"}
