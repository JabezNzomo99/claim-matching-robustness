A related bill passed in the House, but Rubio's bill didn\u2019t go anywhere in the Senate. So we wondered why Rubio said it \"passed.\"\n\nTurns out, Rubio\u2019s legislation was included word-for-word in a larger bill known as the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, which was signed into law in August 2014. This law addressed the Veteran\u2019s Health Administration scandal in 2014, in which Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned following outcry that the VA had falsified data in regards to the long wait times veterans were met with when using VA hospitals.\n\nThis bill passed the Senate 93-3, with four members not voting. It passed in the House 265-160, with six members not voting.\n\nOne highlight from the law provides for more accountability for negligent senior managers of the law, which includes the ability to remove or demote senior executive officers for misconduct.\n\nRubio had a role in the passage of the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014.\n\nNews reports provided by his spokeswoman backed this up.\n\nA McClatchy DC report in March gave Rubio credit for playing a \"vital role\" in the final legislation, although the specific overhaul he sponsored did not pass.\n\nAnother report from CBS Miami mentions that Rubio was asked to be a part of the committee that oversees problems with veteran\u2019s health care: \"While he is not a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, Rubio was asked to be part of the conference committee due to his work in sponsoring the VA Management Accountability Act of 2014.\"\n\nAnd finally, Capitol newspaper The Hill said Rubio\u2019s section about firing negligent VA workers was included in the overall bill-turned-law.\n\nMarco Rubio\u2019s latest ad said he \"wrote and passed bipartisan legislation allowing the VA to fire negligent workers.\"\n\nThis is fairly accurate, with the one caveat being that his legislation was included in a larger bill, and passed as law with other reforms to the VA system.\n\nWe rate this Mostly True.\n\nEditor's Note: This fact-check was updated Aug. 25, 2016, to clarify House action on a bill related to Rubio's.", "lang": "en"}
