A Polygraph.info fact check shows that statistics do not back that up.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "December 27, 2016", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-17235", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/is-georgian-economy-in-crisis/28195236.html", "vclaim": "On December 14, 2016, Irma Inashvili, General Secretary of the Alliance of Patriots \u2013 a pro-Russian party in parliament \u2013 said that \u201cin reality, the country is in an economic crisis, as it was in the Nineties.\u201d \n\n \n\n But while Georgia is going through challenging economic times, statistics show the economy is in much better shape than it was back then. \n\n \n\n Economic data shows that Georgia\u2019s economy in 2016 is experiencing modest growth with moderate inflation.\n\n \n\n But in the 1990s, the economy was in a free-fall, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling by 17 percent in one year and inflation soaring to an unprecedented 15,000 percent. \n\n \n\n Mercedes Vera-Martin, a deputy division chief at the International Monetary Fund, said that \u201cin the context of subdued global growth, the Georgian economy has shown resilience and continues to recover.\u201d She added that while economic growth is not as strong as projected, \u201creal GDP growth is now estimated at 2.7 percent in 2016\u2026For 2017, economic growth is projected to pick up to 4 percent, supported by investment.\u201d\n\n \n\n According to Georgia\u2019s National Statistics Office, in 2015 \u201creal growth of GDP amounted to 2.9 percent.\u201d In a recent report, the World Bank wrote that Georgia showed \u201csignificant progress in poverty reduction\u201d and \u201cshared prosperity in recent years.\u201d \n\n \n\n Vladimer Papava, a professor of economics at Tbilisi State University, wrote in an email to Polygraph.info that \u201ctoday we do not have a hyperinflation and/or economic decline. On the contrary, the economy is growing.\u201d He said that contrary to the 1990s, when many people refused to use banknotes, today \u201cpeople are not turning away from the Lari\u201d - Georgia\u2019s national currency.\n\n \n\n In an email to Polygraph.info, New America Foundation analyst Michael Cecire told Polygraph.info that Georgia\u2019s economic growth this year is \u201cpretty disappointing,\u201d but \u201cit is not a recession by any means.\u201d \n\n \n\n That\u2019s in sharp contrast to conditions Georgians faced in the 1990s.\n\n \n\n The World Trade Organization said in a report that \u201cafter independence in 1991, the economy collapsed under the impact of civil war. Output fell by 70 percent and exports by 90 percent, the worst decline suffered by any transition economy.\u201d The WTO reports said that \u201cby 1994, Georgia\u2019s GDP was estimated at 17 percent of its 1990 level \u2013 the greatest fall among the countries of the former Soviet Union.\"\n\n \n\n The deep economic crisis in the 1990s was seen in out-of-control inflation. The World Bank reports that in 1993 inflation reached a staggering 15,444 percent. Per capita GDP fell by 43.3 percent in 1992. \n\n \n\n Georgia\u2019s GDP in the 1992-1999 period varied from $2.5 billion to $3.6 billion. By comparison, in 2014-2016, Georgia\u2019s GDP averaged $15 billion, a roughly five-fold increase over the economy of the 1990s. \n\n \n\n \u201cIt defies reason to compare the current economic situation to that of the 1990s,\u201d analyst Cecire told Polygraph.info. \u201cGeorgians have more individual opportunities for subsistence as well as greater access to a variety of consumer goods\u2026and a state apparatus that generally functions well and unhindered by the kind of virulent petty corruption and organized crime that was endemic in the 1990s.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
