The man, George Floyd, pleaded repeatedly that he couldn\u2019t breathe and minutes later went limp and appeared to lose consciousness. He later died at the hospital.\n\nBut amid national outrage at what unfolded, misinformation is also spreading.\n\nThe image of Derek Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck, has started to appear on Facebook alongside another photograph of a man with a red baseball cap that reads \"Make Whites Great Again.\" The phrase is a play on President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan.\n\nThe posts suggest that the man in the hat is Chauvin, but it isn\u2019t him.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe photograph actually shows Jonathan Riches, a former federal inmate who\u2019s known for filing lawsuits, including some against President George W. Bush and the late Steve Jobs.\n\nRiches told fact-checking organization Snopes that he is the person in the photograph, but claimed the \"Make Whites Great Again\" slogan was photoshopped.\n\nMeanwhile, he\u2019s seen in other photographs that have now been deleted but still exist in screenshots, wearing a hat with the same wording. A Twitter user also posted a screenshot of Riches\u2019 grandmother sharing the photo. The slogan is the same.\n\nOnline users are misidentifying a photo of a man in a \"Make Whites Great Again\" hat as ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin when it actually depicts a man named Jonathan Riches.", "lang": "en"}
