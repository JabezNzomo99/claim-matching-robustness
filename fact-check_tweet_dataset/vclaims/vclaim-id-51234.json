It was superimposed onto a 2014 image of James wearing an \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d t-shirt.\n\nJames, a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has been active in promoting social justice issues in recent years. For instance, he expressed public support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem.

However, it has been photoshopped.\n\nA reverse image search revealed that the original image, which has been flipped and cropped, actually shows James wearing a t-shirt with the words \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe.\u201d Getty photographer Al Bello took the picture before a 2014 Cleveland Cavaliers game against the Brooklyn Nets, according to the caption. (He played for the Cavaliers at the time.)\n\nIn 2014, James made national headlines for donning the \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d t-shirt in honor of Eric Garner, a black man who died after being put in a chokehold by a New York police officer. If James had worn the \u201cSame Crime\u201d t-shirt, it would also have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time James\u2019 attire has been photoshopped to promote social justice issues on social media. PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, debunked a doctored image of James wearing a t-shirt about racial inequality in October 2017.", "lang": "en"}
