Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of Muslims offering prayers on the rooftops in India. Fact: The photo is not taken in India. The buildings in the photo are located in Dubai. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the background of the photo, a building that looks like a mosque can be seen beside a waterbody. So, when searched for that building on the internet using reverse image search and keywords, it was found that the building in the photo is a mosque located in Dubai. \n\n\n\nThe people on the rooftops in the photo are on the other side of the water body, so when searched for those buildings on Google Earth, all those buildings were found. FACTLY could not find the context of the photo and when it was taken, but it can be concluded that the photo was taken in Dubai, not in India.\n\nTo sum it up, the photo of Muslims offering prayers on the rooftops is from Dubai. It was not taken in India.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
