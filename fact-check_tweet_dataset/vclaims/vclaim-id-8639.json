Period,\u201d Trent said. \u201cHer foreign policy topics have been about peace not war.\u201d\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez has been criticized for some remarks relating to foreign policy, we could find no evidence of her making any comments similar to the alleged quote. Instead, we found that the meme in question gained popularity when it was posted Sept. 4 on the Facebook page of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. That online publication uses numerous websites and its Facebook page to publish content that it deems satire, but that is routinely mistaken for valid news.\n\nIts Facebook post did not explicitly identify the meme as satire, though its page\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d section has a disclaimer that notes: \u201cNothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. You have been warned.\u201d\n\nThe meme was also published by others across social media in recent weeks, including on the Facebook page of James Harris, a conservative radio host with hundreds of thousands of followers on the platform.\n\nHarris posted a version of the meme Sept. 21 with additional text that doubles down on the deception, which was also popular on other conservative pages. The add-on reads: \u201cDid she REALLY say that? Yep, you\u2019re looking at the future of the Democrat party\u2026\u201d\n\nSome users interacted with the post as if the quote was real, leaving comments questioning her intelligence. \u201cHow did she get out of the 6th grade?\u201d one person asked.\n\nOthers suspected it couldn\u2019t be real and asked for proof of its veracity. \u201cI love ya\u2013but can you please give a source? I can\u2019t find one, & I won\u2019t share until I verify it,\u201d another user wrote.\n\nMany others did not wait for verification. Almost 30,000 Facebook users shared the meme.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nTrent, Corbin, spokesman for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 2018 campaign.
