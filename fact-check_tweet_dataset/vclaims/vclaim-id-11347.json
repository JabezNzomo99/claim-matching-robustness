In the UK there are thousands of such earthquakes each year.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-11347", "url": "https://fullfact.org/news/fracking-causing-earthquakes/", "vclaim": "Eighteen \u201cseismic events\u201d were detected near fracking sites in Lancashire in the nine days following 18th October.\n\nFracking was controversially resumed in Lancashire earlier this month after a seven year suspension.\n\nThe earthquakes detected were all very weak and the British Geological Survey (BGS) says earthquakes of these strengths are hardly ever felt by people and occur several thousand times in the UK each year.\n\nWhat is fracking and what\u2019s it got to do with earthquakes?\n\nFracking is a technique used to extract natural gas from underground shale rock. Water, sand and chemicals are injected at high pressure into underground boreholes to open up cracks in the rock. This allows trapped gas to flow out to the surface.\n\nThe BGS says: \u201chydraulic fracturing is generally accompanied by micro-seismicity (very small earthquakes that are too small to be felt)\u201d as rocks are deliberately fractured and move against each other.\n\nThat sort of \u201cmicro-seismicity\u201d has been observed at the Lancashire fracking sites. Since fracking resumed this month, the biggest earthquake measured 1.1 on the magnitude scale and the others were all below 1.\n\nTo understand how big that is, it\u2019s important to know that magnitude is measured on what\u2019s called a \u201clogarithmic\u201d scale. That means that each step up the scale indicates a ten times increase in size. For example a magnitude 2 earthquake is 10 times as large as a magnitude 1 earthquake, not twice as large.\n\nOr to give a real world example, the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 which destroyed most of the city and killed up to 3,000 people had a magnitude of 7.9. That\u2019s over six million times larger than the 1.1 magnitude earthquake in Blackpool.\n\nThe BGS says earthquakes with magnitudes lower than 2 are not usually felt, and if they are then by a small number of people who are near the focal point. Meanwhile earthquakes less than 1 are \u201chardly ever felt\u201d.\n\nWhile the BGS has observed lots of these small earthquakes in Lancashire over the past few weeks, it hasn\u2019t observed many at other locations.\n\nThat\u2019s not because they\u2019re not happening though. The BGS has temporarily installed sensors which can detect extremely small seismic events in the Blackpool area, while its other sensors in the rest of the UK typically can only detect earthquakes with magnitudes of 2 or above.\n\nIt also says that it\u2019s normal to expect several thousand small earthquakes in the UK each year that measure above 0 on the magnitude scale.\n\nSeismology expert at the University of Southampton Dr Stephen Hicks told us that there have almost certainly been incidents when fracking triggered earthquakes in existing geological faults.\n\nFor example, before fracking was suspended in 2011, a magnitude 2.3 earthquake was detected close to a fracking site in Lancashire (though the BGS says it\u2019s unable to say conclusively if it was caused by fracking).\n\nBut Dr Hicks said it\u2019s difficult to predict when fracking might trigger earthquakes because existing fault lines in subterranean rock haven\u2019t yet been completely imaged.", "lang": "en"}
