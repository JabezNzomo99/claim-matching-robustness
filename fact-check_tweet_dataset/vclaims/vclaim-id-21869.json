They\u2019re easy to manipulate. That\u2019s the easy part,\u201d the meme quotes her as saying. The remark allegedly comes from commentator Dick Morris\u2019 book \u201cRewriting History.\u201d\n\nThe quote does not appear in the text of the book, nor does it appear anywhere credible online.\n\nMorris is a political commentator, author and former adviser to President Bill Clinton. He worked for the 1996 presidential re-election campaign of Clinton until a tabloid reported that Morris had been seeing a prostitute and allowed her to listen to White House phone calls. He resigned a couple months before the general election.\n\nAfter the release of Hillary Clinton\u2019s autobiography, \u201cLiving History,\u201d Morris published \u201cRewriting History\u201d as a rebuttal.\n\nThe meme cites Morris\u2019 book as the source for its quote, however, these words do not appear in the text. The Daily Caller found no reputable sources for the remark online. According to Snopes, the image first appeared on the Tumblr page \u201cShocking Hillary Clinton Quotes\u201d in October 2015. The page was last active in November 2018.", "lang": "en"}
