On 16 April 2020, three men including two Hindu Sadhus were beaten to death by a mob in Palghar district (Maharashtra) on suspicion that they were thieves. The Maharashtra Government has arrested over 100 people allegedly involved in that incident. FACTLY has found the claim (there is no Hindu among those arrested in the Palghar incident) to be false. Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh during a press meet about the incident had said that there is no \u2018Muslim\u2019 among those arrested in the incident. The Home Minister, in a tweet, also shared the list of names of those arrested in the Palghar incident saying that the incident is being communalized by a few. The Press Trust of India has also tweeted again clarifying that it made a mistake earlier.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
