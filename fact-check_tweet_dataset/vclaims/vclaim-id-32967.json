She has claimed that this is how the Wayanad MP surveyed the flood-affected areas in Kerala.\n\nKishwar tweeted the video with the caption: \"Fun Watch-Wayanad MP's aerial survey of flood affected areas in Kerala.\"\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is around four months old when Rahul had a rally in Madhya Pradesh before the Lok Sabha elections. The archived version of the tweet can be seen here. The post is also being shared on Facebook with similar claims.\n\nTo verify the claim, we ran a search on the internet with keywords \"Rahul Gandhi Eating Samosa\" and found some news reports containing the viral video.\n\nAs per the media reports, Rahul had the famous samosa of Shahdol during his election campaign in Madhya Pradesh. He addressed a rally before the Lok Sabha elections this year. The video was posted on April 24, 2019.\n\nWe also found the longer version of the video on YouTube.\n\nIncessant rainfall led to severe floods affecting many parts of Kerala since August 8. The death toll in the state rose to 104 on Thursday (August 15).\n\nMember of Parliament from Kerala's Wayanad, Rahul visited his constituency on August 12 to review the flood situations. He had also tweeted some photographs from the relief camps.\n\nBased on the investigation, it is clear that the viral video is not from Rahul Gandhi's recent visit to Wayanad. The video is around four months old.", "lang": "en"}
