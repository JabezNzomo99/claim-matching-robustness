In reality, the people on the boat are part of a whale-watching tour in Baja California where human interaction with the sea creatures is a big drawcard.\n\nThe most recent post on Facebook featuring both the picture and the claim appeared here on January 21, 2020, where it was shared more than 330 times.\n\nBut the same claim has been around on Facebook here, here and here since at least 2013, with one post here having been shared more than 36,000 times.\n\nThe claim describes how a female humpback whale (the picture is actually of a gray whale) was saved by a rescue team that spent hours underwater cutting her free from crabbing lines in a risky operation.\n\nShe is then said to have swum joyously in circles before \u201cthanking\u201d each rescuer with a gentle nudge.\n\nThe incident is purported to have taken place near the Farallon Islands, a wild and eco-rich area west of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge where whales return seasonally to feed.\n\nTheir migration to the Farallon Islands sustains tour boat operators like this one, from May to November.\n\nA Google reverse image search finds links here, here and here where the picture appears without the accompanying claim, while various references are made to Baja California in Mexico, another hotspot for migrating whales.\n\nAmong the links is this website here, which in December 2013 offered a \u201cBaja Whale Petting\u201d trip on auction. The page featured four photographs, including the image used in the \u201crescued\u201d whale claim and a second one (see below) showing a boat from Pachico\u2019s Eco Tours.\n\nPachico\u2019s Eco Tours sells trips on the San Ignacio Lagoon in Baja, offering people the chance to enjoy close contact with migrating gray whales. The picture used in the claim can be found on the company\u2019s website here.\n\nThe company told AFP: \u201cThe picture was taken at San Ignacio Lagoon about seven years ago by Jesus Mayoral, captain and guide at Pachico's Ecotours. The picture belongs to Jesus and Pachico's Ecotours.\u201d\n\nJesus Mayoral is the son of company founder Pachico Mayoral, the \u201cwhale whisperer\u201d who died in 2013 after a lifetime in whale conservation.\n\nWhile the claim shared in Facebook posts is false, there have been dramatic rescues of entangled whales, some captured on video here and here.", "lang": "en"}
