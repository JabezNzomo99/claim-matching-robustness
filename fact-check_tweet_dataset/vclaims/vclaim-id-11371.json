But there hasn\u2019t been a federal execution in 15 years, and state executions have sharply declined in recent years.\n\nTrump went to Illinois to campaign for Rep. Mike Bost on the same day that a gunman killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. The president said he considered canceling his visit, but he decided he did not want \u201cto change our life for somebody that\u2019s sick and evil.\u201d (Trump wrongly recalled that \u201cthe New York Stock Exchange was open the following day\u201d after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It did not reopen until Sept. 17, 2001.)\n\nIn addressing his supporters, the president called for the execution of the alleged gunman, Robert Bowers.\n\nAlthough Trump did not mention this to his audience, the federal government reinstated the death penalty in 1988, and there are currently more than 60 prisoners on federal death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. That includes Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted and sentenced to death in 2015 for the Boston Marathon bombing\n\nOn the same day as Trump\u2019s rally in Illinois, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania Scott W. Brady charged Bowers with 11 counts of obstructing the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death \u2014 a hate crime, which can carry the death penalty. Brady announced the next day that he had initiated the federal approval process required to seek the death sentence.\n\nIn speaking to reporters prior to the rally, Trump seemed to acknowledge that the federal death penalty exists, but he indicated that executions don\u2019t occur fast enough. He made the following remarks when asked if there wasn\u2019t anything that could be done to \u201cend this kind of violence.\u201d\n\nTrump, Oct. 27: I think one thing we should [do] is we should stiffen up our laws in terms of the death penalty. When people do this, they should get the death penalty, and they shouldn\u2019t have to wait years and years. Now, the lawyers will get involved, and everybody is going to get involved, and we\u2019ll be 10 years down the line. And I think they should stiffen up laws, and I think they should very much bring the death penalty into vogue.\n\nHe is right that it takes 10 years, or even longer, for people on federal death row to be executed. There have been only three executions since the federal death penalty was reinstated, and the last one occurred in 2003.\n\nWe asked the White House how the president would like to \u201cstiffen up\u201d death penalty laws, but we did not get a response.\n\nRobert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told us there is little that the president can do to speed up executions. Dunham said it takes time to \u201censure the constitutionality of the process,\u201d saying \u201cexonerations very often take two, sometimes three decades.\u201d\n\nAs for state executions, there has been a steady decline in recent years. The center\u2019s 2017 year-end report says, \u201cEight states carried out 23 executions, half the number of seven years ago, and the second lowest total since 1991.\u201d So far this year, there have been 19, the center says.\n\nDunham said there are multiple reasons for the decline in executions, including the inability of state governments to obtain the drugs they need for lethal injections \u2014 which the National Conference of State Legislatures says is the \u201cprimary method of execution in all 31 states that have capital punishment.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Baze v. Rees that \u201ca state\u2019s use of a three-drug lethal injection protocol for capital punishment does not violate the [constitutional] ban on cruel and unusual punishment,\u201d as the Library of Congress explains on its website. Specifically, the high court \u201capproved a three-drug combination of (1) sodium thiopental, a sedative that induces unconsciousness, (2) pancuronium bromide, a muscle relaxer that induces paralysis, stopping respiration, and (3) potassium chloride, which causes cardiac arrest.\u201d\n\nBut drug manufacturers since then have refused to sell their drugs for executions, and states have had difficulty in obtaining the right combination of drugs they need to carry out an execution that meets the court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cSince the Baze opinion, lethal injection drugs have become increasingly difficult for states to purchase due to stopped production and manufacturer refusal to sell to states for the purpose of execution. States have used new drugs or turned to compounding pharmacies in order to carry out executions,\u201d the NCSL says.\n\nFor example, Hospira Inc. \u2014 the sole U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental \u2014 suspended production of the drug in 2009 due to difficulties procuring its active ingredient, and then two years later stopped production permanently after moving its manufacturing to Italy. In 2011, the European Union also banned exports of sodium thiopental. Unable to obtain the drug in the U.S. or from EU countries, Arizona, California and Tennessee imported sodium thiopental from other foreign sources \u2014 until death row inmates in those three states successfully sued in Cook v. FDA to force the Food and Drug Administration to prevent the importation of a drug that was not FDA-approved.\n\nMore recently, the FDA refused to allow the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to import sodium thiopental, citing the Cook v. FDA case.\n\nIn 2015, Customs and Border Protection stopped a shipment of the drug headed to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Texas requested that the FDA let the shipment continue, and twice the agency refused \u2014 first during the Obama administration in 2015 and then again during the Trump administration in 2017.\n\nIn an April 20, 2017, letter, the FDA informed Texas that the confiscated drug could not be used and ordered the state to either \u201cexport or destroy the drugs.\u201d\n\nThe federal government also uses lethal injections. Maurice Chammah, who writes for the criminal justice website The Marshall Project, wrote that \u201cthe federal government has been unable to carry out executions, creating a de facto moratorium,\u201d since 2010, because it \u201chas had the same problems finding lethal injection drugs as many state prison systems.\u201d\n\nDunham said it is \u201cunclear if the federal government has the drugs to carry out the executions.\u201d\n\nSo, while Trump says he wants to \u201cbring back the death penalty,\u201d the federal government and 31 states already have the death penalty. It is also true, however, that it takes \u201cyears and years,\u201d as Trump said, to carry out executions and the number of state executions has been trending down in recent years.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear what the president has in mind to \u201cstiffen up\u201d death penalty laws.", "lang": "en"}
