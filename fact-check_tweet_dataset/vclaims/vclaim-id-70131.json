S embassy during a Friday night, Oct. 19th protest against Trump\u2019s response to the caravan and also as a show of solidarity for the caravan.\"\n\nGeller did not respond to an email or a Facebook message.\n\nSo, while Breitbart accurately characterized the flag-burning as being the work of protesters, that didn\u2019t stop other bloggers from mischaracterizing its origin.\n\nLike Geller, conservative Christian blogger Bob Williamson posted the AP photo and, referring to the caravan, said, \"The worst thing I've seen is them painting a swastika on our American flag and then burning it. What the heck are these people thinking?\" A poster at conservativeunderground.com gave the photograph this headline: \"Honduran 'Refugees' Paint Swastika On Our Flag Then Burn It.\"\n\nThis photograph was taken by an AP photographer during a protest in Honduras that was staged in support of migrants caravanning to the U.S. border. It does not show members of the \"caravan migrant army\" burning a defaced U.S. flag.", "lang": "en"}
