We found former presidential nominee Hillary Clinton cited a dubious study on billionaires profiting during the pandemic, and former Labor Secretary Hilda Solis went too far in describing an Obama-era effort on overtime pay.\n\nClinton got it wrong when she said that \u201cbillionaires got $400 billion richer\u201d during the pandemic.\n\nThe figure is misleading. It comes from a May 21 study by two liberal advocacy groups, Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies. They estimated a $434 billion increase in the net worth of America\u2019s more than 600 billionaires during what they erroneously called \u201cthe first two months of the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d Actually, the pandemic started much earlier, costing those billionaires plenty.\n\nThe study picked March 18 as the pandemic\u2019s starting date. But that\u2019s five days after the White House proclaimed a national emergency because of the pandemic. And by that time the pandemic and its economic effects had already been raging for a long time. By March 12, over 1,600 Americans in 47 states were known to be infected according to the White House proclamation.\n\nMore to the point, investors started reacting weeks earlier to the pandemic\u2019s global disruption of travel, tourism and manufacturing, sending stock values into a historic plunge. Between Feb. 19 and March 18 the S&P 500 had already lost over 29% of its value.\n\nOther stock indexes showed similar plunges from the previous high for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost nearly 33% of its value by March 18, and the NASDAQ composite index had lost nearly 29%.\n\nThe study claimed the American billionaires had \u201cgained\u201d 15% in net worth in the two months following March 18 \u2014 but that was simply regaining what had been lost in the weeks before.\n\nIt\u2019s accurate to say that low-wage and less educated workers have suffered the worst pain of the pandemic \u2014 certainly more than those with white-collar jobs and substantial assets. But Clinton\u2019s talking point grossly exaggerated that reality.\n\nSolis said when Barack Obama and Joe Biden were in the White House, \u201cThey extended overtime pay to more than 4 million workers.\u201d They tried to do that, but the Obama-era rule never went into effect.\n\nFederal labor laws require overtime pay (one-and-a-half times the regular pay) for time worked beyond 40 hours in a week. But there\u2019s an exemption for \u201cexecutive, administrative, professional and outside sales employees\u201d if they\u2019re paid over a certain amount, as a Labor Department fact sheet explains.\n\nThe Obama administration wanted to raise that income threshold \u2014 to $47,476 a year from $23,660 a year. That would have made an additional 4.2 million employees eligible for overtime pay, according to Labor Department estimates at the time.\n\nBut while the administration finalized such a rule in May 2016, and it was supposed to go into effect on Dec. 1, 2016, that didn\u2019t happen. As we\u2019ve explained before, 21 states sued the Labor Department, and in November 2016, a District Court judge found the rule was unlawful and blocked it from taking effect.\n\nThe Trump administration proposed a different rule on the matter, to raise the income cut-off to $35,308. That rule took effect on Jan. 1. The Labor Department estimates it would extend overtime pay to about 1.3 million workers this year.\n\nWhile we didn\u2019t find anything to fact-check from Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 speech accepting the Democratic nomination for vice president, President Donald Trump responded to her address with a false, all-caps tweet claiming that Harris once called Biden \u201ca racist.\u201d\n\nAs we have written, Harris did not call Biden a racist. In a June 27, 2019, Democratic debate, then-presidential candidate Harris criticized Biden\u2019s comments about working with political opponents, including two senators who supported segregation, and Biden\u2019s position on busing students to integrate schools. But she prefaced her remarks by specifically stating, \u201cI do not believe you are a racist.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
