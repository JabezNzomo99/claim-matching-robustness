Edward Holmes, an evolutionary virologist from the University of Sydney who has written about the origin of the new virus, explained via email that the two viruses \u201cshared a common ancestor that lived a long time ago. What this means is that [the new coronavirus] is NOT derived from RaTG13.\u201d Holmes noted another virus that \u2014 like RaTG13 \u2014 was sampled 1,000 miles from Wuhan in a cave in Yunnan is a closer relative to the new virus, but \u201cnot close enough to be the direct ancestor.\u201d And critically, he said, this other virus, \u201cis not from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, nor from anywhere else in Wuhan.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Shi and her team published a study revealing that they had found a coronavirus from a bat that could be transmitted directly to humans. After reviewing the study, Rasmussen said via email that just because these viruses could attach to human cells, it \u201cdoes not show that they are particularly effective at doing so.\u201d Binding is only one part of the process. \u201cIt is not the sole determinant of viral fitness (the ability of the virus to replicate robustly in a given host) or pathogenicity (the ability of the virus to cause disease).\u201d Moreover, genomic analysis reveals that none of the virus samples used to conduct these experiments were or could have been transformed to be the new coronavirus that causes covid-19.\n\nThen, in an unusual move for the government, officials quickly pinned the outbreak on the market. But they have done little to provide supporting evidence for this theory. Officials reported that 33 of 585 environmental samples from the market contained the new coronavirus. Thirty-one of the positive samples were located in the area of the market known to sell wildlife. But where exactly these samples were taken is not clear. They could just as well have been taken from animal cages or a bathroom. Moreover, China has not divulged the results of any tests done on any animals that were recovered from the market before it was cleaned.", "lang": "en"}
