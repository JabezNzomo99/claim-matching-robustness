Conservative news website Breitbart.com unearthed a potentially controversial line in Lynch\u2019s biography.\n\n\"Obama\u2019s new attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch represented Clintons during Whitewater,\" read a headline from Breitbart\u2019s Warner Todd Houston. Houston wrote:\n\nThere is just one problem. Breitbart got the wrong Loretta Lynch. The mistake was first noted by liberal journalists at Media Matters. Breitbart eventually acknowledged in a correction that they got the wrong Lynch, but left the story up anyway.\n\nLater, Breitbart deleted the story, though it had already spread to other conspiracy, opinion and conservative news websites like , and the .\n\nIn this case, the Truth-O-Meter doesn\u2019t have to work too hard to come up with a rating, but we think it\u2019s important to address anyway because of how quickly false information spreads around the Internet.\n\nThe Loretta Lynch nominated to replace Holder began working as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York in 1990, so she couldn\u2019t have been part of Clinton\u2019s defense a few years later.

This Loretta Lynch served as president of the California Public Utilities Commission from 2000-02 and as a commissioner until 2005.\n\nWe captured this image of her from her last appearance on C-SPAN, when she was addressing senators in 2002 about an alleged scheme by Enron to manipulate energy prices in California.\n\nAn article on Breitbart that has since been deleted said Loretta Lynch, Obama\u2019s new nominee for attorney general, \"was a member of Bill Clinton's defense team during the 1992 Whitewater corruption probe.\"\n\nThe conservative news website got the wrong Loretta Lynch. We\u2019re hoping the correction spreads as fast as the original story.", "lang": "en"}
