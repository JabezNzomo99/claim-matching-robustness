They will go on whinging and whining and moaning all the way through this process. So maybe, just maybe I\u2019m reaching the point of thinking that we should have a second referendum on EU membership. [...] I think if we had a second referendum on EU membership we\u2019d kill it off for a generation. The percentage that would vote to leave next time would be very much bigger than it was last time round.\u201d\n\nAfter the interview, the then leader of UKIP, Henry Bolton, said that UKIP are opposed to a second referendum.\n\nOn the same day, Mr Farage appeared on his LBC radio show, where he said \u201cI fear that Parliament will reject any deal. And I fear that Parliament, both the Commons and the Lords, may well do anything they can to put us through a second referendum. [...] This deal with Europe has to be finished by October. It could be before the end of this year that parliament is voting on the final deal\u2026 So much as I don\u2019t want a second referendum, I have now begun to open my mind to the possibility that this will be forced upon us.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the month Mr Farage was interviewed on Good Morning Britain and discussed a possible vote on the final EU deal with Liberal Democrat Leader Vince Cable, Susanna Reid and Piers Morgan. He said again that he feared a second referendum as \u201ca majority in parliament reject Brexit\u201d, but that he personally didn\u2019t want one.", "lang": "en"}
