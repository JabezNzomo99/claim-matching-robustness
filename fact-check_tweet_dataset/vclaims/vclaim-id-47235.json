Use your face masks all the time. Avoid going out unless necessary. Avoid entering commercial buses\n\n\u201cMy LUTH consultant friend is just telling me that LUTH Lagos admits not less 500 coronavirus patients daily. At the moment, 9 LUTH Professors are presently on admission at LUTH for COVID. So let\u2019s be extraordinarily careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo wrap this confirmation \u2013 Covid-19 is real\u2026 and anybody can be infected\u2026,\u201d a part of the WhatsApp text reads.\n\nFrom the above, two claims were established:\n\n\u00b7 LUTH admits not less down 500 COVID-19 patients on a daily basis\n\n\u00b7 9 Professors from the LUTH are on admission due to COVID-19\n\nIn a bid to curtail the Coronavirus pandemic, the Lagos State Government established at least 8 isolation centres in the state to manage COVID-19 patients.\n\nOn May 8, 2020, the state\u2019s Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, said the state has eight isolation centres with 547 bed spaces.\n\n\u201cGbagada General Hospital \u2013 118; Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi- Araba \u2013 60; Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba \u2013 115; Onikan Stadium Centre \u2013 100; Landmark Centre \u2013 70; Lekki Centre \u2013 45; Agidingbi Centre \u2013 34 and First Cardiology Hospital \u2013 5 (Critical Care),\u201d the Health commissioner stated.\n\nBut in a telephone conversation with The ICIR on Thursday, a Professor of Medical Virology, Prof Sunday Omilabu, who is also a Consultant Virologist and Director of Central Research Laboratory (CRL), College of Medicine, University of Lagos/Lagos University Teaching Hospital (CMUL/LUTH) disclosed that the capacity of the LUTH Isolation Centre is just 120.\n\n\u201cLUTH isolation centre is just 120 capacity, and we are even yet to exhaust the capacity. The claim that we admit 500 patients on a daily basis is fake,\u201d he told The ICIR.\n\nCommenting on the second claim that 9 professors from LUTH were on admission due to COVID-19, Professor Omilabu said: \u201cThis is totally fake news\u201d.\n\nFurther findings by The ICIR from other unofficial sources also corroborated Prof. Omilabu\u2019s comment, thus showing that the WhatsApp post was full of FALSEHOODS.\n\nHe also refuted the claim that 9 professors from the hospital were currently COVID-19 patients.\n\n\u201cThis is far from the truth,\u201d Otuneme said.\n\nBased on all available information obtained by The ICIR, it is evident that the claims are FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
