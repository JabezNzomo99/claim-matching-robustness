To that, Trump responded, \u201cWell, I was never a fan of that war, I\u2019ll be honest with you. I thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away. Nobody ever, you know you\u2019re talking about Vietnam, and at that time, nobody had ever heard of the country.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump did not state that was the reason he didn\u2019t serve. Trump received several draft deferments in order to attend college and for bone spurs in his feet. In the same interview, he stated that he felt that he had made up for not serving by increasing the U.S. military\u2019s spending budget while in office.\n\nTrump did state he wasn\u2019t a \u201cfan\u201d of the Vietnam War, but he didn\u2019t give that as the reason he didn\u2019t serve. He was simply stating his opinion about the war when asked if he regretted not serving in it. We therefore rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
