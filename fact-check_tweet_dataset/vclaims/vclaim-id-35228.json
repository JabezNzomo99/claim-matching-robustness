(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThere are screenshots of several tweets from one account in the Facebook post, including these:\n\n\"BREAKING While leaving the US Capitol nancy Pelosi has been intercepted by US Marshals and ARRESTED (!) under the direct order of President Trump. WH claims ripping up speech was violation of decorum provision of Rule XIX!\"\n\n\"Marshals holding Pelosi are NOT(!) allowing her a phone call or to contact her attorneys. Chuck Schumer is racing back to the US capitol. White House sources say that she will be transported to undisclosed location TONIGHT (!) to face MILITARY TRIBUNAL (!!!)\"\n\nFirst of all, Pelosi didn\u2019t break the law when she tore up a copy of President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address on Feb. 4. Trump, among others, wrongly claimed it was illegal.\n\nAnd while some people have signed a Change.org petition calling for her arrest after she ripped up her copy of the president\u2019s speech, no arrest has happened. We found no news coverage online about Pelosi being taken into custody. If she had been arrested, it would have drawn plenty of media attention.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
