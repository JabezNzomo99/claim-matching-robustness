A\n\nin the article shows that 45,500 people were on\n\nHowever, not all were in the public sector, as Ramaphosa claimed. The figure was estimated using both statistics from the public sector and surveys which measured the number of people treated in the private sector and by non-governmental organisations (NGOs).\n\n, one of the article\u2019s authors and an epidemiologist at the University of Cape Town\u2019s\n\n. He said that the article did not calculate a breakdown showing private and public patients.\n\nFor this he pointed us to an\n\nof his from 2012. In it, Johnson estimated that there were 47,500 people on antiretroviral treatment in 2004. Of these, only 9,600 were receiving their treatment through the public sector. The vast majority of patients (80%) received their treatment from the private sector or NGO programmes.\n\nJohnson said his 2012 estimate of the number of people on antiretroviral treatment in South Africa in 2004 (47,500) differed from the newer estimate (45,500) due to a change in methodology.\n\n\u201cThe methods we have used to estimate these numbers have changed over time. Previously we were just taking the raw data and we weren\u2019t trying to fit any kind of statistical model to it,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat we have done in the more recent paper is to try to fit smooth time trends to the data. That process has led to some change in the numbers.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa was incorrect about the number of people on antiretroviral treatment in the public health sector in 2004. \u2013\n\nCommenting on the importance of human resources and talent in South Africa, Ramaphosa\n\nthat the size of the country\u2019s economy has doubled over the past 25 years.\n\nThe size of a country\u2019s economy is measured by its gross domestic product (GDP). This is the value of all goods and services produced in a given period, usually a year.\n\nGDP can be measured by using current or nominal prices, which take into account inflation over the years. But it\u2019s important to separate inflation from real economic growth,\n\n, head of the school of economic and business sciences at\n\ndata based on constant or real GDP \u2013 where the effect of inflation is removed \u2013 shows that South Africa\u2019s economy\n\n1.9 times from US$225.6 billion in 1994 to $429.8 billion in 2018. (\n\nBased on this data, Ramaphosa\u2019s claim is correct. \u2013\n\nInequality is commonly measured with the Gini coefficient.
