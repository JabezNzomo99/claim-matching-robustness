Processions of criminals from about 15 police stations of Indore were taken out by the cops. Accused and suspects were among those who were beaten publicly by the police. The report claims that the police were taking out these goons from their homes and beating them up in their locality to reduce the fear of these men from people\u2019s mind.\n\nUP Police\u2019s fact-check division also took to Twitter and clarified that the video is not from the state.\n\nIn conclusion, a four-year-old video of men publicly thrashed by Madhya Pradesh police was shared as Uttar Pradesh police taking action against stone-pelters in the backdrop of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the state.", "lang": "en"}
