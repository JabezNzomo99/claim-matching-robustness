That\u2019s correct.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that \u201cthey need us more than we need them\u201d, as it was often put during the referendum campaign. There are other ways to look at this.\n\nFor example, UK exports to those other EU countries are worth around 13% of the value of our economy, whereas for the EU it\u2019s only 3-4%.\n\nAnd while domestic producers might be happy, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be in the interests of consumers or businesses to make imports more expensive. We buy EU imports because we want them, not to do French wine producers or Irish beef farmers a favour.\n\nThe value of the trade deficit was about \u00a360 billion in the 12 months to September 2016. The UK imported \u00a3302 billion worth of goods and services from the EU, and exported \u00a3242 billion worth, according to the Office for National Statistics. (Figures from the EU statistics agency are different but still show a deficit.)\n\nThat deficit is because of goods; we actually have a trade surplus with the rest of the EU in services.\n\nThe Question Time discussion was mostly concerned with tariffs (import taxes) on goods. But services are a far bigger part of the UK economy than goods, and tariffs aren\u2019t considered the biggest issue in international trade these days.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of a few sensitive products where tariffs remain high, it is non-tariff barriers that are the real impediment to international trade today\u201d, as the Institute for Government puts it.", "lang": "en"}
