I\u2019ve been holding on to this footage for way too long. Every time I decide to post it, they take it down. What\u2019s up? I mean, the top floor [of] Buckingham Palace \u2026 just a naked-looking Filipino kid, you know, tied a whole bunch of sheets together just \u2026 just for the heck of it. Yeah, that\u2019s it. Just for the heck of it. He\u2019s willing to try to escape naked, leap out of that floor, while a parade is going by. What has happened to that kid that he\u2019s willing to do that? Imagine that. This kid looks like he falls to death here in about 10 seconds. This is what you are deciding to not listen to and not understand, on everything that I\u2019ve been trying to tell you what\u2019s going on in the world. Your world is run by Satanists, and these are their victims, and we seem to think that it\u2019s just funny and okay. That\u2019s [expletive] sad. The world you live in people, controlled by pedophiles.\n\nHowever, neither the video clip nor the description of it offered by \u201cCovert Geopolitics\u201d was real. The \u201cCovert Geopolitics\u201d version of the clip was actually a slowed-down, looped, lower-resolution version of a video \u2014 purportedly captured by a tourist in London \u2014 that prompted a good deal of consternation and speculation when it mysteriously appeared online in early 2015:\n\nThe shocking clip was posted on YouTube earlier today and has so far been watched by more than 500 people. It appears to show a man climbing down from a window before falling spectacularly. The incident was captured by bystanders standing over the road from the royal residence. It is not known whether the man was injured in the apparent fall. It\u2019s also not clear whether the clip is a hoax, but we will bring you more details as we get them. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the video.\n\nThat clip, in turn, was a stealth promotion created for the upcoming premiere of the E! Entertainment television series \u201cThe Royals,\u201d a \u201cdrama about a fictional British Royal family who inhabit a world of luxury and regal tradition that also involves intrigue and unexpected twists, revealing the complexities faced by royals trying to maintain high-profile relationships under scrutiny\u201d:\n\nThe [naked guy] video made headlines when it was uploaded from what seemed to be a tourist\u2019s YouTube channel while visiting Buckingham Palace during the changing of the guard. In the video, an almost completely naked man (minus a sock) was seen climbing down a bed sheet, on the side of the palace from a window. Blogs and news agencies from Daily Mail to Cosmopolitan covered the video not knowing whether it was real or fake while users took to the comments to share their opinions. But now, we have answers. With the \u201cexclusive, never-before-seen extended footage of the scandal\u201d from D-Throned, an online tabloid covering E!\u2019s fictional modern day royal family from \u201cThe Royals,\u201d it\u2019s clear that this was a clever way for E! to give viewers a glimpse of the drama that will go down on the upcoming premiere season of the new show. In the full tabloid video, viewers see that the naked man was actually escaping from Princess Eleanor\u2019s (Alexandra Park) chambers, once again putting her back into the spotlight. \u201cThe renegade royal has been spotted dancing wildly at a late night club and snogging at least one member of the cabinet,\u201d the narrator explains.\n\nWhatever activities the Satanists of the world might be up to, producing viral commercials for cable television dramas is probably not among them.", "lang": "en"}
