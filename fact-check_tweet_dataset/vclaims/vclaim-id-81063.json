Cover the tick with the soap-soaked cotton ball and swab it for a few seconds (15-20); the tick will come out on its own and be stuck to the cotton ball when you lift it away. Please pass on.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWhile it is possible that this method can work, it is not recommended by health officials.\n\nVariations of the claim have advised people to apply a myriad of substances to remove the tick, like petroleum jelly or nail polish. Some have suggested lighting it on fire with a match. But none of these procedures are endorsed by experts.\n\nThe CDC cautions people on its website to \"avoid folklore remedies such as \u2018painting\u2019 the tick with nail polish or petroleum jelly, or using heat to make the tick detach from the skin. Your goal is to remove the tick as quickly as possible \u2013 not waiting for it to detach.\"\n\nSince ticks can transfer illness, notably Lyme disease, in just one bite, health officials agree that ticks should be removed from the skin as quickly as possible \u2013 but also correctly.\n\nOfficials at the Mayo Clinic advise grasping the tick \"as close to the skin\u2019s surface as possible, using tweezers if available, and to pull upward with a steady continuous motion.\"\n\nThe University of Rhode Island\u2019s TickEncounter Resource Center also suggests using tweezers, but particularly \"pointy\" ones: \"Household tweezers just aren't the right tool for proper tick removal. TickEase and ProTickMe are two brands of pointy tweezers that work well and are inexpensive, too.\"\n\nThe Bay Area Lyme Foundation also suggests the use of pointy tweezers and cautions not to yank the tick out, as its mouth could remain and so could the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The CDC recommends similar steps for effective and safe tick removal. From its website:\n\n1. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin\u2019s surface as possible.\n\n2. Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don\u2019t twist or jerk the tick; this can cause the mouth-parts to break off and remain in the skin. If this happens, remove the mouth-parts with tweezers. If you are unable to remove the mouth easily with clean tweezers, leave it alone and let the skin heal.\n\n3. After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water.\n\n4. Never crush a tick with your fingers. Dispose of a live tick by putting it in alcohol, placing it in a sealed bag/container, wrapping it tightly in tape, or flushing it down the toilet.\n\n5. Follow-up: If you develop a rash or fever within several weeks of removing a tick, see your doctor. Be sure to tell the doctor about your recent tick bite, when the bite occurred, and where you most likely acquired the tick.\n\nOld viral social media posts claim that smothering a tick in liquid soap and swabbing it is a \"safe\" and \"easy\" way to remove ticks from the skin.\n\nHowever, neither this procedure or others such as using nail polish or lighting the tick on fire, are recommended by health experts. Instead, it is widely suggest to remove the tick quickly with fine-tipped tweezers.", "lang": "en"}
