The entire text of the article reads:\n\nThe solution to reducing the number of people swept into the criminal justice system for drug law violations is to enact various forms of decriminalization of drug use and possession. Decriminalization is the removal of criminal penalties for drug law violations (usually possession for personal use) and Corpus Christi, TX will be the first city in Texas to act on this.\n\nUnfortunately for all weed-loving Texans the story is not true at all:\n\nReact365 is a prank website where users can submit their own headline, description and photo to create realistic looking prank news articles.\n\nUsers don't even need to upload their own image, there is a built-in search function that will pull an appropriate image from Google image search.\n\nThousands of people fell for the joke as you can see in the Trendolizer graph at the end of this article. If you notice anyone spreading the rumor around you can help by pointing them to this article here because nobody likes being given false hope by fake news.", "lang": "en"}
