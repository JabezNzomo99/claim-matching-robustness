Despite the 2019 date it has resurfaced recently.\n\nThe post claims to show a letter from \u201cEd Chenel, a police officer in Australia\u201d. Starting with \u201cHi Yanks\u201d the letter says it will tell Americans about \u201cthe real figures from Down Under\u201d 12 months after \u201cgun owners in Australia were forced by a new law\u201d to surrender 640,000 firearms.\n\nIt claims there have been increases in homicides, assaults and armed robberies since the new law was introduced.\n\nThis post has been viewed more than 1.2 million times and shared 46,000 times.\n\nIt has also appeared on another New Zealand-based page here.\n\nDespite being dated November, 2019 and circulating in early 2020, the purported letter from \u201cEd Chenel\u201d has been circulating on the internet for almost 20 years. It shows up in online forums as far back as 2001 and was circulating on US-based pages such as this and this during 2019\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether an \u201cAustralian police officer\u201d Chenel ever existed, as Google searches for his name only lead back to this same letter or many other articles \u2013 here, here and here -also debunking it.\n\nDespite its \u201cAustralian Gun Law Update\u201d headline, the post refers to laws introduced in Australia nearly 25 years ago, after the Port Arthur Massacre in Tasmania in April, 1996 that left 35 people dead.\n\nIn 1996 former Prime Minister John Howard co-ordinated the National Firearms Agreement, which included a temporary firearms buyback program that resulted in about 640,000 prohibited weapons being bought back between 1996 and 1997.\n\nThe post claims \u201cfirst year results are now in\u201d and show homicide rates rose 6.2 per cent. The Australian Institute of Criminology report, Homicide In Australia 2017-18, published in 2020, shows this claim is false.\n\nThe report shows (Table A3, page 20) that homicides occurred at a rate of 1.82 per 100,000 people in 1994-95, then 1.66 per 100,000 in 1995-96 (the period including the April 28, 1996 Port Arthur massacre).\n\nHomicides were 1.62 per 100,000 in 1996-97 and 1.61 in 1997-98 \u2013 a continuing decrease. Actual numbers of homicides also declined from 327 in 1994-95 to 303 in 1995-96, then 299 in 1996-97, then 300 for 1997-98.\n\nHomicides did rise to 328 in 1998-99 \u2013 a 9.3 per cent rise on the previous year, then fell to 305 in 1999-2000 \u2013 a seven per cent drop. The report shows (Figure 1, page 1) a steady drop in homicides from 1989 to 2017-18, the lowest since the National Homicide Monitoring Program began in 1989.\n\nA 2006 study by University of Sydney and Macquarie University researchers found that the decline in total firearm deaths accelerated after the introduction of the gun laws.\n\nAnd a 2012 paper in American Law and Economics Review by Australian National University researcher Andrew Leigh and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario stated: \u201cFirearm deaths \u2013 both homicide and suicide \u2013 are currently at exceptionally low levels by historical standards\u201d.\n\nThe post claims that assaults were up 9.6 per cent in the year after the gun law changes. This statistic is inaccurate: Australian Bureau of Statistics data (p42) shows there was an 8.6 per cent increase in assault from 1996 to 1997 and a 6.8 per cent increase in assault between 1997 and 1998.\n\nThere was already a rising trend, however, with a 12 per cent increase in assault victims between 1995 and 1996 (p46).\n\nThe 2008 Australian Institute of Criminology report, Trends in Violent Crime, also notes there has been a rising trend in assaults since 1995.\n\nThe claim that there was a 44 per cent increase in armed robberies is correct: ABS statistics show a 44 per cent increase in the number of victims of armed robbery from 1996 to 1997 (p67)\n\nThere was an 18 per cent increase in the number of victims of armed robbery from 1995 to 1996 and a 20 per cent increase from 1997 to 1998.\n\nThe image with the Facebook post, of a truckload of firearms being tipped out, is a Reuters photograph from July,1997 of guns sent to be destroyed after the Australian government buyback scheme.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck finds the claims on the Facebook post to be false. Regardless of whether an \u201cEd Chenel\u201d wrote such a letter, the statistics quoted in it are wrong about homicides and inaccurate about assaults. The post also refers to as \u201crecent\u201d law changes that were made more than 20 years ago. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
