Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: In 1917, one rupee was equal to $13 USD whereas in 2014 $1 USD was equal to Rs. 63. Fact: USD was not weaker compared to Indian Rupee in the year 1917. According to the RBI, the value of One rupee in 1917 is equivalent to 0.314 USD. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn 1917, India was under the British rule and the foreign exchanges were done in the British currency (Pound). According to the Reserve bank of India, during the year 1917, one rupee was fixed at 1 shilling 4 pence \u2013 1s 4d (equal to 0.066 pounds). When a pound is converted into dollars as per the exchange rate prevailing back then, One rupee would amount to 0.314 USD, which means 1USD was equal to Rs. 3.33. So, in the year 1917, the Indian rupee was weaker compared to USD.\n\nAccording to the RBI, the exchange rate by the end of 2014 (i.e. 31-12-2014) was 63.3315. However, the average annual exchange rate of Indian rupee to USD for the year 2014 was 61.0295.\n\nTo sum it up, value of One Rupee in 1917 is equal to 0.314 USD, not 13 USD.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
