Bernie Sanders claim Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg insulted farmers in a 2016 video. The Bloomberg campaign says the video has been \u201ctaken completely out of context.\u201d\n\nThere is definitely more to Bloomberg\u2019s remarks than the 58-second video that has gone viral on Twitter, although we will leave it up to readers to decide whether they have been taken out of context.\n\nBloomberg made his remarks on Nov. 17, 2016, not long after Trump was elected president, while speaking to a group of students and others at the Sa\u00efd Business School at the University of Oxford in England.\n\nThe former mayor of New York was asked how the United States should address income inequality. He responded with a lengthy answer that first touched on \u201csome progress\u201d in the areas of poverty, life expectancy and health outcomes.\n\nThen, Bloomberg talked about \u201ceducational inequality,\u201d which he said could be addressed by charging higher tuition for the wealthy and using the excess funds to charge lower tuition for low-income students.\n\n\u201cBut I think what you got to understand is the people who are getting the subsidy want the dignity of getting a job \u2026 and that\u2019s the conundrum we are going to have here because technology is reducing the ability to give them the jobs.\u201d It\u2019s here when he starts to talk about \u201cthe agrarian society\u201d and the \u201cindustrial society.\u201d\n\nBloomberg, Nov. 17, 2016: If you think about it, the agrarian society lasted 3,000 years, and we can teach processes. I can teach anybody \u2013 even people in this room, so no offense intended \u2013 to be a farmer. It\u2019s a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, you add water, up comes corn. You can learn that. Then you had 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in direction of arrow and you can have a job. And we created a lot of jobs. At one point, 98% of the world worked in agriculture. Today it\u2019s 2% of the United States. Now comes the information economy and the information economy is fundamentally different because it\u2019s built around replacing people with technology, and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze. And that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set. You have to have a lot more gray matter. It\u2019s not clear the teachers can teach or the students can learn. And so the challenge of society is to find jobs for these people. \u2026\n\nBloomberg\u2019s critics on the right and left seized on the comment about it taking \u201ca lot more gray matter\u201d to work in the \u201cinformation economy.\u201d\n\nPeople for Bernie, a Twitter account with 188,100 followers, retweeted the Bloomberg video on Feb. 16, saying it shows \u201cBloomberg insulting the middle class and the working class.\u201d The video has more than 3.3 million views.\n\nSimilarly, Donald Trump Jr. the same day tweeted that the video shows Bloomberg \u201creally hates regular hardworking Americans\u201d and \u201cwill never fight for them.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the Bloomberg campaign said its candidate wasn\u2019t talking about today\u2019s farmers; he was talking about how to help educate Americans for better-paying, higher-skilled jobs in the \u201cinformation age.\u201d The campaign points to the fact that the viral video doesn\u2019t include Bloomberg\u2019s opening reference to \u201cthe agrarian society [that] lasted 3,000 years.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he video cuts off Mike\u2019s first sentence where he is referring to agrarian society that lasted 3,000 years, not farmers today,\u201d the Bloomberg campaign said in a press release that accused Sanders\u2019 supporters of using the same misleading tactics as Trump supporters.\n\nThe Bloomberg campaign has a point about the way the viral video has been edited. The former mayor\u2019s simplistic description of farming \u2014 \u201cYou dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, you add water, up comes corn\u201d \u2014 has been ridiculed on Twitter as insulting to farmers. But it comes in the context of him talking about \u201cthe agrarian society [that] lasted 3,000 years,\u201d and machine workers using a \u201clathe\u201d machine in the \u201cindustrial society.\u201d A lathe machine is one of the oldest machines known to man.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the viral video doesn\u2019t include Bloomberg\u2019s discussion of \u201ceducational inequality,\u201d his suggestion to address that inequity through increased scholarships for low-income students, or when he said that \u201cthe challenge of society is to find jobs for these people.\u201d\n\nBut we leave it up to voters to decide if Bloomberg\u2019s words \u2014 in their full context \u2014 show he \u201creally hates regular hardworking Americans,\u201d as Donald Trump Jr. tweeted, or were \u201cinsulting the middle class and working class,\u201d as People for Bernie claims.", "lang": "en"}
