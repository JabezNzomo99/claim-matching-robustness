(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nJohnson deleted the tweet after he said he discovered a portion of it was inaccurate.\n\nProtesters seeking the resignation of St. Louis\u2019 mayor in a controversy over police reform marched toward the mayor\u2019s house and past the McCloskeys\u2019 home.\n\nThe couple stood outside their home and brandished guns at the marchers, with Mark McCloskey saying his family feared for their lives because they said marchers had broken through a wrought iron gate that secured a private street in the neighborhood.\n\nThe local prosecutor is investigating to see whether the couple should be charged.\n\nNow to the three parts of the claim.\n\nThe McCloskeys expressed support for Black Lives Matter in a statement released by their attorney, Albert Watkins, the day after the June 28 incident.\n\n\"The peaceful protesters were not the subject of scorn or disdain by the McCloskeys. To the contrary, they were expecting and supportive of the message of the protesters,\" the statement said.\n\nThe statement also quotes Watkins as saying:\n\n\"The Black Lives Matters movement is here to stay, it is the right message, and it is about time. The McCloskeys want to make sure no one thinks less of BLM, its message and the means it is employing to get its message out because of the actions of a few white individuals who tarnished a peaceful protest.\"\n\nThe tweet from Johnson included what appears to be a screenshot of Federal Election Commission data showing the name of Mark McCloskey and ActBlue. No other data is shown, but presumably the screenshot purports to show McCloskey donated to the group.\n\nActBlue is a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and other causes like Black Lives Matter.\n\nJohnson apparently realized he erred on this part of his claim.\n\nOn June 30, Johnson tweeted an image of that tweet with this message: \"I deleted this tweet because the FEC screenshot that went viral online was from a different donor of the same name.\"\n\nAccording to the FEC, Mark McCloskey of the viral video made 20 contributions between October 2016 and February 2017 to the Republican National Committee or Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Those are his most recent campaign contributions.\n\nMcCloskey also made a few donations in 1996 to Republican politician Bill Phelps\u2019 congressional campaign, a primary committee for the 1988 Bush-Quayle ticket, and the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nFEC records show that he has donated to Democrats in the past. Between 2004 and 2012, McCloskey donated to Democratic candidates, including Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill.\n\nOn June 29, it was reported that a Democrat running for a Missouri state Senate seat said his campaign won\u2019t keep a $250 contribution he received from Mark McCloskey in 2019.\n\nWe didn\u2019t find any donations from Patricia McCloskey in the FEC database.\n\nSo, based on the pattern of their recent campaign contributions, it\u2019s wrong to say the couple are Democrats.\n\nIn Missouri, voters do not register a party affiliation.\n\nMark McCloskey represents Isaiah Forman, a man who is suing a police officer over injuries sustained during an arrest. According to a March 6 Associated Press news article:\n\nForman is serving a seven-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to second-degree assault on a special victim for crashing into a St. Ann, Mo., police car during an April 2019 chase. David Maas, then a police officer in suburban Woodson Terrace, kicked and struck Forman while he was compliant and not posing a physical threat to anyone, causing \"bodily injury\" and depriving him of his right to be \"free from unreasonable force,\" according to an indictment filed against Maas. Maas has been charged by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in St. Louis with one count of deprivation of rights under color of law.\n\nA lawyer for Maas denied the claims in the lawsuit and said Forman \"aggressively resisted arrest\" and \"struck a police vehicle, narrowly missing a police officer in the process.\"\n\nA viral image shared on Facebook claimed that a lawyer-couple who pointed guns at protesters are Black Lives Matter backers, Democrats and represent a police brutality victim.\n\nThere is some truth to it. The couple expressed support for Black Lives Matter after the incident, via a statement from their attorney. And Mark McCloskey represents a man who has filed a lawsuit alleging police brutality.\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason the tweet was taken down. It uses campaign donation data from the wrong Mark McCloskey. The Mark McCloskey in the video has donated to both Democratic and Republican candidates, including multiple donations to the Republican National Committee and President Donald Trump.", "lang": "en"}
