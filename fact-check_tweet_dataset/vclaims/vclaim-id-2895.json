(The Post later reported that Flynn had been warned in November that Kislyak\u2019s conversations \"were almost certainly being monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies.\")\n\nThe Flynn-Kislyak conversation raised questions about whether Flynn had undercut Obama\u2019s move against Moscow, particularly after Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to retaliate.\n\nIn the days after the Post revealed the Flynn-Kislyak phone call, key members of the Trump transition team, including White House press secretary Sean Spicer, Vice President Mike Pence and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, denied that sanctions came up during the conversation. Flynn also denied this to the Washington Post.\n\nBut Flynn\u2019s guilty plea removes any lingering doubt about whether sanctions figured into his discussion with the Russian ambassador.\n\nThe charging document reveals that on or about Dec. 29, Flynn asked Kislyak to \"refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed on Russia that same day.\" The document also reveals that Kislyak told Flynn that Russia \"had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request.\" (See the full charging document here.)\n\nDays after Flynn was sworn in as national security adviser, the Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 22 that he was under investigation, making Flynn the first person in the Trump White House to be named in the probe.\n\nDays later, FBI agents interviewed Flynn and asked whether he had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Kislyak. The Washington Post, citing anonymous current and former U.S. officials, later reported that Flynn had denied the allegation to the FBI during his Jan. 24 interview.\n\n\"Lying to the FBI is a felony offense,\" the Post article stated, a point that now seems prescient.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s charging document gives certainty to the timeline of Flynn\u2019s discussion with the FBI.\n\n\"On or about Jan. 24, 2017,\" the document states, \"defendant Michael T. Flynn did willfully and knowingly make materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements and representations (...) to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\"", "lang": "en"}
