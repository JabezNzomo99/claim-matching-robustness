This followed an interview Hodges gave to the Voice of America Serbian Service, in which he said that the presidents of Serbia and Kosovo should be protected from pressure from both Russia and the Serbian Orthodox Church, as they negotiate to normalize relations between Belgrade and Pristina.\u200b\n\nHodges served as Commander, United States Army Europe (USAREUR) from 2014 to 2017. He is currently the Pershing Chair in Strategic Studies at the Center for European Policy Analysis, (CEPA).\n\nIn his VOA interview, Hodges discussed the talks between Serbian President Aleksandr Vu\u010di\u0107 and the Kosovo President Hashim Tha\u00e7i, to ease their strained relations. An agreement between the two countries would open the doors for Serbia to the European Union and allow Kosovo to join international institutions such as the United Nations and Interpol.\n\n\u201cSerbia can be a responsible and positive influence in the region,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cTherefore, I think we need to help provide an opportunity for the two presidents (Vu\u010di\u0107 and Tha\u00e7i), to be able to give them some space. That means no \u2018red lines\u2019 imposed from the outside. Help protect them from pressures from Russia, as well as allow them to deal with internal pressures they have, from the Orthodox Church for example.\u201d\n\nA portion of t\u200bhe VOA Serbian Service interview with Ben Hodges, Pershing Chair of Strategic Studies, CEPA. Video produced for by Nik Yarst.\n\nSputnik Serbia wrote in response: \u201cThe fact that the [SPC] Serbian Orthodox Church has been a thorn in NATO\u2019s eye has been known before, but it seems that this is a rare occasions when one of the highest positioned U.S. soldiers bluntly named the Orthodox Church as a key obstacle to transforming the map of the region into an Atlantic model.\u201d\n\nThe Moscow-controlled web portal further claimed that the \u201cpersecution of the SPC [Serbian Orthodox Church] in North Macedonia, as well as the latest heightened tensions and pressure on its diocese in Montenegro, can be interpreted as part of the wider strategy of the West to counter Orthodoxy.\u201d\n\nBoth of Sputnik Serbia\u2019s claims are false.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that several NATO member states \u2013 Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Montenegro -- have predominantly Christian Orthodox populations. North Macedonia will soon be joining the alliance, and Ukraine and Georgia, which have Orthodox Christian populations, have also applied for NATO membership.\n\nSecondly, the Macedonian and Montenegrin Orthodox Churches have for decades \u2013 since even before the breakup of Yugoslavia -- sought autocephalous status and independence from the Serbian Orthodox Church.\n\nGreece has been a NATO member since 1952 and its population includes more than 10 million Eastern Orthodox Christians.\n\nEastern Orthodoxy is often called Greek Orthodoxy marking the historic connection between contemporary Greece and the Byzantine Empire, the cradle of Christian Orthodoxy, from which first Bulgaria and then Kyivan Rus\u2019 accepted Christianity in 9th and 10th century, respectively.\n\nRomania, one of the most dedicated NATO members, and a staunch opponent of Russian neo-imperialism, has the fourth-largest population of Orthodox Christians in the world -- 19 million.\n\nNorth Macedonia, whose population is 70 percent Eastern Orthodox, is poised to join NATO soon. Georgia is next in line with very close relations with the Alliance. While most Orthodox Christians in Russia (estimated between 58 million and 101 million) reportedly do not practice their faith regularly, the Orthodox Church in Georgia has a very strong following and significant public influence.\n\nUkraine has made the strategic decision to join the Alliance following the Maidan revolution in 2014. With its 35 million Orthodox Christians, Ukraine has the third-largest Christian Orthodox population in the world, almost equal to Ethiopia\u2019s 36 million.\n\nUnlike the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church is structured differently, as each national Church can be independent, or autocephalous (having canonical independence), and therefore not subordinated to a central authority such as the Vatican. For example, the Bulgarian, Romanian, Serbian, Greek, Georgian and other Orthodox Churches are autocephalous: each has its own Patriarchate.\n\nThe Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the oldest Slavic Orthodox Church in the world, has been autocephalous since 919. It became the first new patriarchate to join the initial Pentarchy. Its independence preceded the autocephaly of the Serbian Orthodox Church (1219) by 300 years and that of the Russian Orthodox Church (1596) by some 600 years.\n\nIn fact, when Kyivan Rus officially adopted Christianity, it procured from Bulgaria church literature and other documents written or translated in the Slavic language under the patronage of Boris I, the ruler of the First Bulgarian Empire. The books introduced the Slavic alphabet, created by the Slavic brothers Cyril and Methodius and their disciples, to Kyivan Rus and, much later, to Russia (which did not exist as a state at that time). The Kyivan Patriarchate was moved to Moscow more than three centuries later, as the Muscovite empire expanded.\n\nAlthough established more than three centuries before the Russian Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 the successor of the Orthodox Church of Kyivan Rus \u2013 was the most recent one to gain autocephaly in January 2019. The long struggle for independence from Moscow finally ended when the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew I, signed a decree of independence in Istanbul, formalizing the Ukrainian Orthodox Church\u2019s split from the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe Orthodox Churches of Montenegro and North Macedonia are going through a similar battle for independence from Serbia. And, as in Ukraine, the issue also is tied to national identity, state sovereignty and the history of external domination over the national Church.\n\nThe Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church granted autonomy to the Macedonian Orthodox Church in 1959 in the then-Socialist Republic of Macedonia. However, the Macedonian Orthodox Church remained in canonical unity with the Serbian Church under the Serbian Patriarch. But in 1967, the Macedonian Holy Synod unilaterally announced its autocephaly and independence from the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Serbian Holy Synod, however, denounced the decision and condemned the clergy as schismatic.\n\nThe Serbian Orthodox Church has been engaged in a prolonged dispute with the Macedonian Church since independence over recognizing its autocephalous status and jurisdiction over Church properties in North Macedonia.\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople does not recognize the Macedonian Church as independent, though the Bulgarian Orthodox Church has been supportive of its aspirations for autocephalous status. In 2017, the Bulgarian patriarch received a formal request for help from his counterpart in Skopje. However, any unilateral move in that direction could turn the matter \u201cinto an apple of discord among Orthodox Churches...and damage the fragile peace in the Western Balkans,\u201d warned Ines Murzaku, Professor of Church History at Seton Hall University in New Jersey.\n\n\u200bThe Montenegrin Orthodox Church proclaimed itself autocephalous in 1993, but, like its Macedonian sister Church, it has not won international recognition. The Montenegrin Orthodox Church was autocephalous until 1918, when Belgrade banned its activities after the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. In 1922, Serbia obtained from Constantinople a decree recognizing the \u201cunification\u201d of the Serbian Orthodox Church with the Montenegrin Church.\n\nBut the question of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church\u2019s independence from Serbia has become a national concern, which Montenegro\u2019s President Milo Djukanovic clearly expressed last December. \u201cThe Serbian Orthodox Church has very persistently been undermining Montenegrin independence. I believe that it is necessary to continue the work on restoring the autocephalous Montenegrin Orthodox Church, and the state will do this and bear responsibility for this,\u201d said Djukanovic.\n\nIn June, he said that \u201cthe Serbian Orthodox Church is trying to obstruct, through various forms, the European desires and ambitions of contemporary Montenegro, seeking to preserve its religious monopoly in Montenegro, and obstruct the establishment of the rule of law.\u201d\n\nAnalysts in Belgrade also confirmed the Serbian Orthodox Church\u2019s efforts to weaken Montenegro\u2019s independence and even attempt to reverse its NATO membership (Author\u2019s interviews in Belgrade in June 2019).\n\nThe struggle of Montenegro and North Macedonia for an independent Church resembles the fight of Ukraine to split its Church from that of Russia. Ukraine had been under Russian military attack for five years and still had to justify to the world why Moscow should not dominate its Orthodox Church.\n\nBoth Moscow and Belgrade have reportedly attempted to undermine the sovereignty of neighboring states through the influence and control of their Orthodox Churches. While NATO does not view Orthodoxy as an adversary, the Russian Orthodox Church and the Serbian Orthodox Church evidently view NATO and its allies as enemies.\n\nStill, the interests of Moscow and Belgrade don\u2019t always coincide with those of their respective Orthodox Churches: while Belgrade, supported by Moscow, would like Kosovo partitioned and its northern part added to Serbia, the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo is against this, as it would lose half of its parishioners and, consequently, its standing in Kosovo. Ben Hodges stressed this in his interview.", "lang": "en"}
