Ayanda Capital Ltd was the only bidder. Its Chief Operating Officer is quoted as saying that the contract was \u201csuccessfully fulfilled.\u201d\n\nWhile it is undisputed that the PPE was delivered, it was subsequently revealed that the masks were deemed by the Department of Health and Social Care as not suitable for use in the NHS. It is unclear whether they were used elsewhere.\n\nThe second relates to a series of contracts awarded to Uniserve Ltd, amounting to \u00a3186 million. Uniserve Ltd was the only bidder for all five contracts.\n\nThe company regularly publishes updates on its deliveries of PPE. We asked the company as to the status of PPE deliveries related to those contracts and will update this piece if we receive a response.\n\nConcern has been raised about how the government procured PPE and other services during the pandemic. There have been reports of PPE being delayed or unusable.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that some PPE contracts have not been fulfilled, but there is no evidence we\u2019ve seen that all of the contracts, if any, listed in this Facebook post remain unfulfilled.", "lang": "en"}
