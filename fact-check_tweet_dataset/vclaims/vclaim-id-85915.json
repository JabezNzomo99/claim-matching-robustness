Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) is emphasizing his vote against TARP without mentioning his vote for it.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T18:45:34Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85915", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/18/gop-lawmaker-was-for-wall-street-bailout-before-he-was-against-it/", "vclaim": "Lawmakers must cast many votes, often on bills with slight variations in language, which allows lawmakers (and their opponents) to pick and choose what they want to highlight. As former Sen. John F. Kerry once unartfully put it: \u201cI actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his answer, to let the economy go down?\u2019\u2019 Simpson said. \u2018\u2018Sometimes Bill puts himself in a philosophical position that\u2019s untenable that he can\u2019t get off of. We got into this mess because of the failure of government oversight. Consequently, I think there\u2019s a role for government to play in trying to get us out of this, as much as I don\u2019t like it.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThe financial system depended on this. This was not a bank bailout, this was a financial and credit system bailout. We had credit being frozen in this country and we were looking at potentially and I think most economists will agree probably 25-30 percent unemployment in this country if we did nothing. I\u2019m unwilling to accept that. So we did what we thought was necessary. If there are other ideas out there that we could\u2019ve done to free up this credit situation, we would have looked at those options also. But to just sit back and say \u2018Let em fail.\u2019 That was not an option I was willing to accept.\u201d\n\nOddly, though in 2010 Simpson said it \u201cwas not a bank bailout,\u201d now his own campaign ad calls it a \u201cWall Street bailout.\u201d And it says that in 2009 he voted to repeal the law. So what is that about?\n\nThis is yet another vote, which took place on Jan. 21, 2009, when Democrats controlled the House of Representatives. It was a failed procedural vote to direct a committee to terminate half of the funding and develop a repayment plan for the money that had been spent.\n\nIn other words, it was not an actual vote on a piece of legislation, though that did not stop the Club for Growth from offering a \u201cscorecard\u201d rating of the motion, which is described in Club for Growth literature as \u201cRepeal & Repay TARP.\u201d\n\nSimpson spokeswoman Nikki Watts, saying the lawmaker has been \u201cconstantly consistent,\u201d provided a copy of a statement that Simpson issued a few days after this vote, regarding a related resolution that disapproved additional TARP funding (but which was not binding). In the statement, Simpson said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d that the funds were being used differently than originally intended, adding: \u201cI cannot support any continuation of this program without clear and fundamental changes to ensure that the taxpayers\u2019 investment pays long-term dividends.\u201d\n\nThis is a thin needle to thread, but essentially Simpson voted for TARP and at times has defended the vote as absolutely necessary at the time, but gave himself wiggle room to say that the money was not properly spent and should be rescinded. However, as far as we can tell, he did not emphasize his 2009 vote against TARP until recently. He also has not said he regretted the initial vote; he is just silent on it.\n\nProPublica, which has closely tracked the spending of government bailouts, reports that so far the U.S. government has earned nearly $15 billion in profit on TARP, having disbursed $421 billion and received $436 billion in refunds, dividends, interest and other proceeds. (In 2010, the $700 billion spending cap for TARP was reduced to $475 billion, but not even all of that was spent.)\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s a bit of irony here. The \u201clong-term dividends\u201d Simpson demanded in that 2009 statement have actually been received. He could have kept defending his vote and called it a success story, though apparently that\u2019s not a message that resonates among Idaho Republicans.\n\nSimpson, by picking and choosing what votes he wants to highlight, is misleading Idaho voters. He should not emphasize the vote to end TARP without acknowledging that he voted for the program in the first place. At the same time, it is noteworthy that Club for Growth at time signaled the 2009 vote against TARP was significant enough to be counted on its scorecard. So, in the context of this campaign, the group cannot dismiss the vote as insignificant.", "lang": "en"}
