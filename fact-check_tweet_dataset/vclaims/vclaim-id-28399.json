I don\u2019t think that America will again have a leader like him.\u201d\n\nHowever, the substance of that article had nothing to do with its headline quote. The article\u2019s text featured Reeves reminiscing about the filming of the popular action film \u201cSpeed\u201d in 1994, and a video embedded at the bottom of the article featured Reeves discussing his career with a journalist during the actor\u2019s 2014 visit to Uruguay:\n\nNothing in the article quoted or documented Reeves\u2019 speaking the words attributed to him in the headline. In fact, nothing in the article presented Reeves\u2019 offering anything at all about U.S. President Donald Trump, or even about politics in general.\n\nSince supporttrumppresidency.blogspot.com post\u2019s headline was the origin of this putative quote, yet the site offered nothing whatsoever corroborating it, the words were evidently fabricated for the purpose of driving website traffic.", "lang": "en"}
