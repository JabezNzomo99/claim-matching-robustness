The billboard had an inscribed message that was targeted at the dynasty politics and allegation of corruptions by the Gandhi family. The message reads, \u201c\u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u0916\u093e\u092f\u093e , \u0926\u093e\u0926\u0940\u0928\u0947 \u0916\u093e\u092f\u093e , \u092a\u093e\u092a\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u0916\u093e\u092f\u093e , \u092e\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0940 \u0928\u0947 \u0916\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0906\u0913 \u092c\u0939\u0928\u093e \u0924\u0941\u092e \u092d\u0940 \u0916\u093e\u0932\u094b \u091c\u0940\u091c\u0942 \u0915\u094b \u092d\u0940 \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u092c\u0941\u0932\u093e \u0932\u094b (Grandfather ate, Grandmother ate, Father ate, Mother ate and Sister you also eat and also call brother-in-law -translation)\u201d, reads the Hindi text in the billboard. The word \u2018\u0916\u093e\u092f\u093e (ate)\u2019, contextually refers to corruption.\n\nAlt News found that the Ad banner used in the billboard is photoshopped with the Hindi text stated above. A reverse search of the image on Google reveals that there are several images of the same car and billboard with different banners, which goes to suggest that it has been photoshopped.\n\nMoreover, the Amul Ad banner, which comprises of the iconic Amul girl, Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi has also been photoshopped with the Hindi text and the Amul slogan (The Taste of India). Amul had tweeted the original photo of the Amul Ad dedicated to Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s entry into active politics before the 2019 general elections.\n\nBoom also spoke to daCunha, the advertisement agency behind the campaign and confirmed, \u201cthe viral photo was fake and it didn\u2019t come from the agency.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, academician Madhu Kishwar tweeted a photoshopped image of Amul Ad, which targeted the Gandhi family portraying it as the official advertisement from the company. In the past as well, the writer and academician has been found spreading misinformation on several occasions (1, 2, 3, 4). Last December, Kishwar tweeted an old video of a rally with a false claim that Pakistani flags were waved by the Muslim community in celebration of the Congress\u2019 electoral victory in three assembly elections. When it was pointed out that she had posted misinformation, she tweeted another misleading video to defend her last tweet.", "lang": "en"}
