These goats are arriving in tuck loads into Ajmer Live stock market and are being sent to slaughter houses to process meat. Avoid Mutton in all forms.\ud83d\udc47 Just an awareness video, have not checked the credibility of this video\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nSeveral users are advising against the consumption of mutton.\n\nAlt News has received multiple fact-check requests for the video on its mobile application.\n\nThe earliest instance of the video on the internet that Alt News could trace was uploaded on YouTube on December 12, 2019. The first coronavirus case was detected in Kerala on January 30, 2020.\n\nAlt News spoke with the Additional Director (Farms and Estate), Rajasthan Animal Husbandry Department, Dr Pradeep Saraswat, who informed that his office has come across the video. \u201cThis video was also shared with us by the Government of India. Even though I was aware that it\u2019s fake and old, I conducted an investigation. It is fake and no viral infection in goats has been reported in the area. I have also replied to the GOI, Joint Secretary.\u201d\n\nThe department\u2019s Joint Director (Animal Disease Control), Dr Tej Singh, gave a similar statement and called the viral claims \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nGajanand Khatik, a trader at Ajmer bakra market, said, \u201cThis is just an attempt to build a narrative against the consumption of meat. No virus is spreading here. If that were the case, health department officials would have conducted inspections. They [the people spreading rumours] are only trying to hamper our business. Why would we sell contaminated meat and dupe people? The rumours are just spreading due to the coronavirus scare.\u201d\n\nIt is noteworthy that all three men claimed that the video was not shot in the Ajmer bakra market. However, Alt News has not verified the same.\n\nA quick search for media reports echoing social media assertions does not yield results.\n\nAn old video is therefore circulating on social media that goats in Ajmer\u2019s bakra market are either infected with COVID-19 or an unknown virus that is making them sick.\n\nAlt News Science editor Dr Sumaiya Shaikh informs that it\u2019s possible that animals domesticated for consumption or dairy can be infected with the coronavirus. \u201cPrevious scientific research (Haitham Mohamed Amer, Cambridge University Press, 2019) has shown that domestic as well as wild animals including goats have been infected in the earlier coronavirus epidemics.\u201d\n\nHowever, continues Dr Shaikh, \u201cInfection in animals such as goats requires a different strain of the same virus than the one which infects humans. Since it has not been found that goats were infected in Ajmer due to the coronavirus, it is likely that the video is false.\u201d\n\nEarlier a piece of false news was viral that broiler chicken was found to be infected with COVID-19.\n\nTo stay ahead of misinformation related to coronavirus, click here.", "lang": "en"}
