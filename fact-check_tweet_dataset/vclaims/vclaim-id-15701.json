It appears to be a play on the sentiment that \u201cthe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook page Agitprop frequently shares pro-communist content, including this meme of Lenin, who served as the leader of the Soviet Union in the early 20th century. Lenin led the Bolshevik Party through the Russian Revolution in 1917, which ended imperial rule and established a communist state.\n\n\u201cThe monstrous oppression of the working people by the state, which is merging more and more with the all-powerful capitalist associations, is becoming increasingly monstrous,\u201d Lenin wrote in the preface to the first edition of \u201cThe State and Revolution.\u201d\n\nWhile Lenin\u2019s 1917 book does describe the role of the state in society and discuss a proletariat revolution, it does not include the quote above. Neither the phrase nor any variation appears in the complete text.\n\nThe meme seems to be playing with the popular phrase often used by 2nd Amendment advocates who say the \u201conly way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\u201d That reasoning is used to promote concealed carry permits, armed teachers, et cetera.", "lang": "en"}
