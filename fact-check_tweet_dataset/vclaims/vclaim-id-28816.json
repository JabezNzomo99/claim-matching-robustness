That\u2019s a simple military strategy; if you are defensive you are already defeated. The best way is to be aggressive.\u201d This was a tweet by filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri, which has now been deleted.\n\nAgnihotri was ostensibly referring to the Indo-Pak war of 1965. \u201cCommander in chief Gen Chaudhuri\u201d refers to General Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri who was the chief of Army staff from 1962 to 1966. The tweet, a screenshot of which is posted above, was the first of a series of tweets in which Agnihotri lashed out at former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for adopting a defensive strategy in the wake of Pakistani aggression. The entire thread now stands deleted.\n\nAccording to Agnihotri, Jawaharlal Nehru not only vacillated at a moment when the chief of Army staff was insistent on opening new fronts in the war, but ordered his general to stop when the latter opened up a new front in Punjab, and was barely 15 miles away from Lahore.\n\nIt may be noted that the Indo-Pak war of 1965 commenced in August-September 1965. The trigger for the conflict was Operation Gibraltar by the Pakistani army, in which Pak army regulars disguised as locals infiltrated into Kashmir in large numbers with the hope of fomenting rebellion in the state and subsequently annexing it.\n\nThe Indo-Pak war of 1965, which was fought across three sectors- Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan, had ended with Pakistan failing to secure its objective of fomenting insurrection in Kashmir. The conflict took a decisive turn when Indian troops opened up a new front in the Punjab, threatening the capture of Lahore, before a ceasefire was announced, ending the hostilities.\n\nWho was the Prime Minister in 1965?\n\nThe Prime Minister of India in August-September 1965 when the war broke out, was Lal Bahadur Shastri. This is the stuff of elementary knowledge and can be easily accessed on the internet. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) website lists the Prime Ministers who have served the country since independence. Jawaharlal Nehru had died in May 1964. He was succeeded by Lal Bahadur Shastri who was at the helm in 1965.\n\nIt is thus nothing short of ludicrous to point fingers at Jawaharlal Nehru for the outcome of the 1965 war, when the man wasn\u2019t even alive then. It is barely surprising that Agnihotri deleted the entire thread.\n\nAlt News found that the series of tweets by Vivek Agnihotri, which he later deleted, was tweeted verbatim from the work of deceased spiritual guru Rajneesh Osho. In his book \u2018From Darkness To Light\u2019, there is a chapter titled \u2018Either politicians remain or humanity remains\u2019. Rajneesh is responding to a question, \u201cDo politicians have brains?\u201d, to which he gives a protracted response. The date of this interaction is mentioned as March 29, 1985.\n\nUpdate: The article has been updated with new information. Vivek Agnihotri\u2019s tweets were taken from an excerpt from a book by Rajneesh Osho.", "lang": "en"}
