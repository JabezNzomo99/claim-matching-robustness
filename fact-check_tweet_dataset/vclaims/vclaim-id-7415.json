Instead, in a statement, Trump Jr. insisted that \u201cit was not a campaign issue at the time.\u201d He said that \u201cwe primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government.\u201d\n\nWe know this only because, under pressure, Trump Jr. was forced to release the emails regarding the meeting. The first email, on June 3, 2016, via British citizen and music publicist Rob Goldstone, said: \u201cThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nBut in any case, it is disingenuous to claim that this is standard campaign behavior. Stuart Stevens, chief strategist for the 2012 Mitt Romney campaign (and now a Trump critic), said if he had gotten a message that a foreign government had dirt on a former secretary of state, \u201cI would have told a campaign lawyer, and the campaign lawyer would have called the FBI.\u201d\n\nStevens pointed to an incident during the 2000 campaign, when he was part of George W. Bush\u2019s media team, as the appropriate response by a campaign. The Bush campaign had a tightly held briefing book to prep Bush for his debates with then-Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee. There were only seven or eight debate books, each with a specific typo on the opening page so a leak could be traced, he said. Someone associated with the campaign anonymously shipped a copy of the 120-page book, along with a 60-minute videotape of mock debate sessions, to Tom Downey, then a congressman from Long Island who was assisting Gore with the debates and playing the role of Bush in mock debates.\n\nDowney said he quickly realized what the materials were and contacted a lawyer, who called the FBI so it could take possession of the materials. Downey then recused himself from any further debate prep \u2013 a move that Stevens and Downey said probably hurt the Gore campaign because Downey, as one of Gore\u2019s closest friends, was so central to the preparation. A woman who worked for media consultant Mark McKinnon, a colleague of Stevens, was eventually charged and sentenced to a year in jail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a close call\" about how a campaign should react, Stevens said. Downey recalled that the FBI agent who took charge of the debate material, who was not political, initially had trouble understanding why it was valuable. He added that as Gore\u2019s friend, he received all sorts of unverified rumors about Bush over the transom from Bush\u2019s political opponents. When he asked Gore whether the material should be checked out, Gore replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to win using that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer was Natalia Veselnitskaya. She has insisted that she was not representing the Russian government in the meeting, but what\u2019s important is what Trump Jr. was told \u2013 that she was working on behalf of the Russian government. Moreover, it later emerged that she worked closely with a top Kremlin official, Yuri Y. Chaika, the prosecutor general, to block a Justice Department fraud case against a Russian company. The Associated Press reported that she was \u201ca ghostwriter for top Russian government lawyers.\u201d\n\nThe talking points that she brought were found to match a document that Chaika\u2019s office had given to a U.S. member of Congress two months earlier, the New York Times reported. Adding to the intrigue, the U.S. research firm that hired former British spy Christopher Steele to compile a \u201cdossier\u201d on Trump\u2019s ties to Russia also assisted the U.S. law firm that defended the Russian company.
