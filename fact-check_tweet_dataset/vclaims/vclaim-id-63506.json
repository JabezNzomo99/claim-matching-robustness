There are still more people alive then (sic) dead!\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Trump ever tweeting the statement.\n\nThe screen grab masquerades as a tweet sent from Trump\u2019s verified Twitter account, saying, \u201cIt is unbelievable that President Obama criticized me for the coronavirus virus response. He had eight years to prepair (sic) the next president for a pandemic and he failed. I have done a tremendous job. There are still more people alive then dead!\u201d\n\nBut there is no record of Trump ever tweeting the statement.
