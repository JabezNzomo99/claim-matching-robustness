(Hindi text: \u0935\u094b\u091f \u0926\u0947\u0928\u0947 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0917\u090f \u0924\u094b \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0915 \u0905\u0915\u093e\u0909\u0902\u091f \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u091f\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0947 Rs 350).\n\nBut within hours a screenshot of the same story went viral on Facebook and WhatsApp with the disclaimer at the bottom cropped out.\n\nSeveral readers sent the below screenshot on BOOM's WhatsApp helpline (7700906111) asking us if it was true.\n\nHowever, the paper maintained that it was only carrying out its tradition of publishing satire on Holi.\n\n\"We at Navbharat Times have a history of carrying satirical news on Holi every year, \" Deputy News Editor, Naveen Krishnan told BOOM.\n\n\"We also carried a disclaimer with every report and also below the anchor story on the page that made it clear that all the stories and advertisements carried on this page are fictitious.\"\n\n\"If somebody crops the disclaimer or erases it with the help of Photoshop, how are we to be blamed for it?\" Krishnan said.\n\nMarathi newspaper Lokmat also published a similar story with a disclaimer on Friday though it is not clear how two separate newspapers ran the same satirical piece.\n\nThe satirical piece was also viral on Facebook, once again, without the disclaimer.\n\nNavbharat Times in its March 21, 2019 edition, dedicated an entire page to what they termed, 'fake news in Hindi'.\n\nFor instance, the headline of the lede news on the page reads, '\u092a\u093e\u0915 \u0928\u0947 \u0939\u093e\u092b\u093f\u091c \u0938\u0908\u0926 \u0915\u094b \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0915\u0947 \u0939\u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e, \u0905\u092c \u0926\u093e\u090a\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0930\u0940' (Pakistan Hands Over Hafiz Saeed To India, Its Dawood's Turn Now).\n\nHowever, with voting beginning April 11, any piece of information regarding polling can be shared without context on social media.\n\nTake for instance NBT's satirical piece on voting.\n\nThe article claimed that the Election Commission of India has issued orders to deduct Rs 350 from the accounts of those who don't cast their votes this year. The bogus report further said that the non-voters would be identified through their Aadhaar cards and the amount would be deducted from the accounts linked to Aadhaar numbers. The newspaper even made up a quote attributing it to the spokesperson of the EC.\n\nWhile, NBT has shared the same article from its official Facebook page, several Facebook users have taken it at face value.\n\nAnother satirical article from the same page that has gone viral is regarding Hafiz Saeed.\n\nThe headline claims Pak Hands Over Hafiz Saeed To India, It's Dawood's turn Now (Hindi text: \u092a\u093e\u0915 \u0928\u0947 \u0939\u093e\u092b\u093f\u091c \u0938\u0908\u0926 \u0915\u094b \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0915\u0947 \u0939\u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e, \u0905\u092c \u0926\u093e\u090a\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0930\u0940).\n\nSeveral Facebook users shared a screenshot of the story with a caption that translates to,'What will happen to those who were asking for proof?'\n\nThe post can be seen here and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe volume of fake news seen in the run-up to Lok Sabha polls has forced the Election Commission of India and social media platforms to agree on a code of ethics in what is going to be India's first social media led general election.", "lang": "en"}
