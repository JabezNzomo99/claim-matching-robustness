Over the phone, Lewis said Let\u2019s Move \u201cisn\u2019t still active but the mission continues through partnerships and relationships developed during the Obama Administration.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that Obama said Let\u2019s Move \u201chelped\u201d reduce obesity rates among 2- to 5-year-olds in the United States, not that the initiative was completely responsible for the drop. When we asked for proof that it \u201chelped,\u201d he said he would provide some by email, but has yet to do so.\n\nWhen research reporting a decline in the obesity rate of 2- to 5-year-olds was released in 2014, the White House put out a press release quoting the first lady. Though she was \u201cexcited\u201d to see that rates had declined over 10 years, she didn\u2019t attribute the decline directly to Let\u2019s Move.\n\nExperts told us there is no evidence the initiative directly influenced childhood obesity rates.\n\nThe former first lady launched Let\u2019s Move with the goal of \u201csolving the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation.\u201d The initiative\u2019s programs aimed to \u201censure that 60 minutes of physical activity [per] day is the norm in K-12 schools across the country\u201d and to encourage schools to incorporate salad bars into lunches, among other goals.\n\nAs for achievements, according to the initiative\u2019s archived website, Let\u2019s Move \u201c[i]ncreased access to fruits and vegetables\u201d by \u201cproviding 3 million students with a salad bar,\u201d for example. \u201cReaching over 12 million kids,\u201d the initiative also equipped schools with \u201ca customized action plan\u201d to increase physical activity among children, the website says.\n\nIn unison with the initiative\u2019s launch in 2010, President Obama signed a memorandum to establish a Task Force on Childhood Obesity. In a May 2010 report, the task force outlined a plan that aimed to reduce the U.S. childhood obesity rate to 5 percent by 2030.\n\nBut since the launch of Let\u2019s Move, the obesity rate for all children aged 2 to 19 has remained stable. Between 2009 and 2014, the obesity rate for 2 to 19 year olds has hovered around 17 percent, up from 10 percent for children surveyed in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nSince the 1970s the percentage of U.S. children with obesity \u201chas more than tripled,\u201d reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMichele Polacsek, a childhood obesity expert at the University of New England in Maine, told us by email that a diet including more sugary drinks likely played a notable role in the rise in obesity for both children and adults.\n\n\u201cLiquid calories are especially harmful because they don\u2019t displace other calories in our diet,\u201d she explained. \u201cA 200 calorie drink doesn\u2019t make a person feel \u2018full\u2019 the way a \u2018solid food\u2019 200 calories would.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CDC, \u201c[m]any factors contribute to childhood obesity,\u201d such as genetics, the speed of an individual\u2019s metabolism, eating behaviors and quantity of physical activity. Children with obesity are at a \u201chigher risk\u201d for other chronic health conditions, such as asthma and type 2 diabetes, says the CDC. They are also \u201cmore likely\u201d to suffer from depression.\n\nUnlike the trend for children ages 2 to 19, some research has shown a declining trend since 2004 in the obesity rate for children between 2 and 5 years old. In other words, that trend began before the launch of Let\u2019s Move.\n\nIn a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Cynthia L. Ogden, an epidemiologist at the CDC, and others reported that the obesity rate was 7.2 percent for 2- to 5-year-olds surveyed between 1988 and 1994. This rate peaked at 13.9 percent for kids surveyed between 2003 and 2004.\n\nThe first decline in the obesity rate for 2- to 5-year-olds in more than a decade occurred between 2005 and 2006, when the rate dropped to 10.7 percent from 13.9 percent in 2003-2004.\n\nSince the launch of Let\u2019s Move, the rate has fluctuated \u2013 dropping to 8.4 percent between 2011 and 2012 and rising to 9.4 percent for the children surveyed between 2013 and 2014. However, Ogden told us by email that the \u201cestimates for 2-5 year olds in 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 are not statistically different from each other.\u201d\n\nWhat does \u201cstatistically different\u201d mean?\n\nOgden and her group estimated the obesity rate for the U.S. population of 2- to 5-year-olds as a whole based on a sample of children in that age range. The obesity rate for the 2011 to 2012 survey sample group, for example, is 8.4 percent.\n\nFor the population as a whole, the researchers can only estimate the rate within a range, which they call a \u201cconfidence interval.\u201d The range for the 2011 to 2012 survey period, for example, is 5.8 to 11.7 percent.\n\nThis means Ogden and her group can confidently say that the entire 2 to 5 year old population\u2019s obesity rate falls within that range, based on their analysis of the sample group. And the ranges for the 2011 to 2012 and 2013 to 2014 survey periods aren\u2019t all that different from one another.\n\nOverall, the researchers concluded the obesity rate for 2- to 5-year-olds rose steadily until it peaked in 2003 to 2004, and then began to decline.\n\nBut Michael Goran, an expert in childhood obesity at the University of Southern California, isn\u2019t completely convinced by these numbers.\n\n\u201cThere has not been a consistent fall in obesity levels and levels tend to fluctuate from year to year,\u201d he told us by email. \u201cWe need to see a consistent change to make any more definitive conclusions.\u201d\n\nGoran added \u201cthere is no way to directly link/draw a line between what Let\u2019s Move did and changes in the obesity rate,\u201d as Obama claimed.\n\nPolacsek, at the University of New England, also told us there\u2019s \u201cno evidence\u201d that Let\u2019s Move \u201cdirectly affected the obesity rate.\u201d\n\nPolacsek added that it \u201cwould be very difficult to tie\u201d Let\u2019s Move \u201cback directly to national obesity rates especially given that obesity is a multifactorial problem and so many other programs were working to impact obesity rates at the same time.\u201d\n\nPolacsek held back from making a definitive claim on whether or not there\u2019s a solid declining trend in obesity rates for 2- to 5-year-olds. But she did acknowledge that obesity prevalence percentages for 2- to 5-year-olds \u201cjump around quite a bit.\u201d The number of participants for each survey period \u201care actually pretty small once they are broken down by age,\u201d she explained, and the \u201csmaller the numbers in analyses\u2014the more likely they are to jump around.\u201d This means that Ogden\u2019s analysis is \u201cmost useful when looking at multi-year trends but no conclusions should be drawn from one data point to the next,\u201d added Polacsek.\n\nHowever, the CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture does have some additional evidence supporting a downward trend.\n\nResearchers at these agencies looked at obesity trends from 2000 to 2014 for children ages 2 to 4 years old from low-income families who participated in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. This program provides food, health care referrals, and nutrition education to women and children under 5.\n\nThe researchers found that the obesity rates decreased from 15.9 percent in 2010 to 14.5 percent in 2014. However, that\u2019s still above the 2000 rate, which was 14 percent.\n\nThe report adds that, \u201cLocal, state, and national obesity initiatives,\u201d such as Let\u2019s Move, \u201cmight be contributing to the modest declines in obesity\u201d by raising awareness of the problem of childhood obesity. But the report provides no definitive support.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that it\u2019s unclear whether or not programs started under Let\u2019s Move will continue under the Trump administration.\n\nIn December 2010, Obama signed into law the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which mandated the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \u201cupdate the meal patterns and nutrition standards for the school lunch program\u201d with the aim of \u201creducing childhood obesity.\u201d In January 2012, the USDA finalized a rule that \u201crequires most schools to increase the availability of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free and low-fat fluid milk in school meals,\u201d among other things.\n\nBut earlier this month, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue signed a proclamation that \u201cbegins the process of restoring local control of guidelines on whole grains, sodium, and milk\u201d for school lunches. This includes allowing states to exempt schools from having to provide whole-grain products and beginning the regulatory process to allow schools to provide 1 percent flavored milk, which has added sugars.\n\nLet\u2019s Move may have contributed to a decline in the obesity rate of young children, but there\u2019s no evidence of it, as Obama claimed. Experts say this would be a hard to measure, given that childhood obesity is a multifactorial problem.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "lang": "en"}
