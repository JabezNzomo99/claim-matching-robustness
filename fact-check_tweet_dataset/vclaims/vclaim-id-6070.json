General Assembly, President Donald Trump reprised misleading talking points on everything from job growth to defense spending.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about variations of some of these claims numerous times, but since these comments were made to a world audience, we are revisiting some of them. We also cover new claims the president made on foreign issues.\n\u2022 Trump boasted that \u201cunemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years.\u201d True, but it is a continuation of a years-long trend that predates his election.\n\u2022 Trump misleadingly claimed that \u201cwe have more people working in the United States today than ever before.\u201d Since the population constantly increases, that\u2019s not unusual. The employment-to-population ratio isn\u2019t higher \u201cthan ever before\u201d \u2014 it was higher every month between September 1985 and February 2009.\n\u2022 The president wrongly claimed companies are \u201cmoving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\u201d Jobs have been steadily increasing every month for years. In fact, the job gains have been fewer under Trump than they were during the same time frame in each of the previous four years.\n\u2022 Trump boasted that \u201cthe stock market is at an all-time high\u201d since Election Day. True, but it has reached new heights regularly since March 5, 2013, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped the previous record set in October 2007.\n\u2022 Trump said the U.S. \u201chas achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.\u201d ISIS territory has been reclaimed at a faster rate under Trump, but more territory was reclaimed from early 2015 to early 2017.\n\u2022 The president said the United States \u201ccontinues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance.\u201d That\u2019s true by volume, but not as a percentage of gross national income, or GNI, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As a percentage of GNI, the U.S. ranks 20th out of 28 OECD member countries.\n\u2022 Trump got ahead of himself when he said \u201cwe will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.\u201d The Senate passed a nearly $700 billion defense authorization bill, but it must be reconciled with a House version. And lawmakers still have to pass a separate bill appropriating the money.\n\nThe president addressed the U.N. on Sept. 19 in New York.\n\nTrump boasted that \u201cunemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years.\u201d\n\nThe unemployment rate in August was 4.4 percent, up a tick from 4.3 percent in July, but down from the 4.7 percent rate Trump inherited in January. The unemployment rate briefly hit the same 4.4 percent in 2006 and 2007, but to find a rate lower than that, as Trump says, you\u2019d need to go 16 years back, to early 2001. But as with several other statistics, Trump is taking credit for a trend that long predates his presidency.\n\nAs this chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows, the unemployment rate has steadily declined since its peak at 10 percent in October 2009 during the Great Recession.\n\nTrump claimed that \u201cbecause of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before.\u201d In raw numbers, total nonfarm employment hit a record high in August at 146,730,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But there\u2019s less there than meets the eye.\n\nThe U.S. population is also constantly on the rise. There have been \u201cmore people working\u201d in the U.S. than ever before many, many times since BLS started tracking the data in 1939. Obama could have made that claim every month from mid-2014 on.\n\nBy another measure, the employment-population ratio of people in the U.S. age 16 and over was 60.1 percent in August, slightly higher than nearly every month under Obama, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But it\u2019s not the highest ratio \u201cever.\u201d It was higher in the first two months of Obama\u2019s presidency, and higher every month prior to Obama\u2019s presidency going all the way back to September 1985.\n\nTrump wrongly claimed companies are \u201cmoving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\u201d In fact, the job gains have been fewer under Trump than they were during the same time frame in each of the previous four years.\n\nThe U.S. has been steadily adding jobs every month since early 2010, according to the BLS.\n\n\u201cThe job market is great and getting better,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told us back in June when Trump similarly boasted about job growth as a result of his election. \u201cBut it is unfair to say the good economic news began with Trump\u2019s election. The economy has been consistently creating jobs for about 7 years \u2013 a record length of time. And the pace of job growth has been very consistent; the same before and after the President\u2019s inauguration. The economy was on fundamentally solid ground when Trump took office, and that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nThe nation has now experienced positive job growth for 83 straight months, with 76 of those under Trump\u2019s predecessor.\n\nIndeed, the job gains under Trump, although similar to those during Obama\u2019s last few years in office, have been slightly lower. The economy added 1,189,000 net new jobs since Trump took office in January. That\u2019s slightly fewer than the 1,375,000 jobs added in the preceding seven months.\n\nIt\u2019s also fewer jobs than were added during the same time period of 2016 (1,422,000), 2015 (1,547,000), 2014 (1,734,000) and 2013 (1,384,000).\n\nTrump also touted the rise of the stock market since his election victory in November. \u201cThe stock market is at an all-time high, a record,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s true, but it has reached new heights regularly in recent years after recovering from the Great Recession, which plunged the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a 12-year low in 2009.\n\nThe Dow Jones closed at 6,547.05 on March 9, 2009 \u2014 its lowest point since April 15, 1997. It has been climbing back ever since and reached a new high on March 5, 2013, when it \u201cclosed at 14,253.77, topping the previous record of 14,164.53 on Oct. 9, 2007, by 89.24 points,\u201d as the Associated Press reported at the time. (We note that these figures do not account for inflation.)\n\nSince March 5, 2013, the Dow has continued to set new milestones: 15,000 on May 3, 2013; 16,000 on Nov. 21, 2013; 17,000 on July 3, 2014; 18,000 on Dec. 23, 2014; and 19,000 on Nov. 22, 2016 \u2014 all while President Barack Obama was in office.\n\nThe Dow Jones more than doubled during Obama\u2019s tenure, rising 148 percent from Jan. 20, 2009, to Jan. 19, 2017. (See our pre-inauguration article \u201cWhat President Trump Inherits.\u201d)\n\nThe stock market has continued its remarkable run under Trump. The Dow broke 20,000 on Jan. 25, a few days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, and then 21,000 on March 1 and 22,000 on Aug. 2.\n\nThe Dow closed on Sept. 18 at 22,331.35 \u2014 up 13.2 percent since 19,732.40 on Jan. 19, the day before Trump took office. By comparison, the Dow was up 13.1 percent during that same time period a year ago, from 16,016.02 at close on Jan. 19, 2016, to 18,120.17 at close on Sept. 19, 2016.\n\nSo, while Trump boasts of the stock market being at an all-time high, the Dow Jones is actually just keeping pace with last year.\n\nThe president touted gains made against the terrorist group the Islamic State, saying more had been achieved under his presidency than in \u201cmany, many years combined.\u201d\n\nWe find that while the ISIS territory has been reclaimed at a faster rate under Trump, more total territory was reclaimed during the last few years of Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nWe asked the White House press office about this claim, and a similar boast Trump made in late August, when he claimed \u201crecord-breaking success\u201d against ISIS since his inauguration. But we haven\u2019t received an on-the-record response.\n\nHowever, an Aug. 4 Washington Post story quoted an administration official saying military gains against ISIS have \u201cdramatically accelerated\u201d under Trump\u2019s presidency. But that article included some statistics that contradict Trump\u2019s claim that there has been more achievement in eight months than in \u201cmany, many years combined.\u201d\n\nThe Post quoted Brett McGurk, the State Department\u2019s special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS. McGurk credited moves by Trump, such as giving more decision-making authority to on-the-ground commanders rather than the White House, for increasing success against ISIS. He said, according to the Post, that ISIS had lost about 27,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria since a peak for the group in early 2015. And nearly a third of that \u2014 about 8,000 square miles of territory \u2014 had been regained during Trump\u2019s time in office.\n\nThat certainly shows an \u201caccelerated\u201d gain, as McGurk said. But there would have been more achievement \u2013 more than two-thirds of the territory reclaimed \u2013 from early 2015 to early 2017. That\u2019s the opposite of what Trump claimed in his U.N. speech.\n\nThe president could have instead said that the rate at which ISIS had lost territory had increased under his presidency. Other data lend support to that as well.\n\nThe analytics and consulting firm IHS Markit released an analysis in late June that said ISIS had lost 30,400 square kilometers from January 2015 to January 2017, and another 24,200 square kilometers from the beginning of January through June. The terrorist group\u2019s territory totaled 90,800 square kilometers in January 2015, IHS Markit\u2019s first estimate.\n\nThose numbers show a 33.5 percent drop in Islamic State territory from 2015 to 2017, but a 40 percent drop since January, which of course would include nearly three weeks of the Obama administration.\n\nIHS Markit also released figures on the decline in the average monthly revenue for ISIS, though the time periods don\u2019t allow for a comparison of the drop under Obama and Trump. The figures show a 62 percent decline in average monthly revenue from the second quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016, and another 48 percent drop from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017.\n\nThe analysis said the Islamic State was \u201cunlikely to survive\u201d in 2018.\n\nColumb Strack, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Markit, said in the group\u2019s press release that ISIS\u2019 \u201crise and fall has been characterized by rapid inflation, followed by steady decline.\u201d\n\nStrack said: \u201cThe Islamic State\u2019s remaining caliphate is likely to break up before the end of the year, reducing its governance project to a string of isolated urban areas that will eventually be retaken over the course of 2018.\u201d\n\nMichael E. O\u2019Hanlon, a foreign policy senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told us that the president\u2019s time frame is off. \u201cISIS only seized its holdings in 2013/2014 so it\u2019s not an issue of many many years. And the tide really started to turn in 2016 with Obama,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon said in an email. \u201cThere is credit (and blame) to go around, and lots more work to do.\u201d\n\nTrump said the United States \u201ccontinues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance.\u201d That\u2019s true by volume, but not as a percentage of gross national income, or GNI, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As a percentage of GNI, the U.S. ranks 20th out of 28 OECD member countries.\n\nIn April 2016, the OECD issued a report on \u201cofficial development assistance,\u201d or ODA, by its member countries in 2015. The U.S. is a member of the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee, and 28 of those countries combined gave a total of $131.6 billion in aid in 2015 to developing countries \u2014 led by $31.1 billion from the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe United States continued to be the largest donor by volume with net ODA flows amounting to USD 31.1 billion in 2015, a fall of 7.0% in real terms compared to 2014,\u201d the report says. (Net ODA is the amount after deducting loan repayments.) Other top donors by volume in 2015 were the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and France.\n\nBut the report also says that the U.S. \u2014 which has the world\u2019s largest economy \u2014 was well below the OECD average as a percentage of gross national income.\n\nThe U.S. net ODA was 0.17 percent of its GNI; the OECD average was 0.30 percent. Sweden had the highest figure at 1.4 percent of its GNI (see chart 1).\n\nIn a 2016 report on U.S. foreign aid, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service noted that the OECD does not capture all foreign aid. It said the OECD does not count \u201cmilitary assistance and aid to developed countries\u201d when calculating a nation\u2019s \u201cofficial development assistance.\u201d\n\nUsing the \u201cbroadest definition of aid,\u201d CRS said that the U.S. provided $48.57 billion in foreign aid in fiscal year 2015, including military assistance. CRS said it used the OECD data for the sake of international comparisons, noting that the U.S. \u201coften ranks low\u201d when its foreign aid is measured as a percentage of GNI.\n\nIn 2015, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom were the only countries that \u201cexceeded the United Nations\u2019 ODA target of 0.7% of GNI,\u201d the OECD report says.\n\nTrump got ahead of himself when he said \u201cit has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.\u201d The deal isn\u2019t final.\n\nThere is a two-step process for government funding: Congress first must pass an authorization bill and then an appropriation bill.\n\nOn Sept. 18, the Senate \u2014 by a vote of 89-8 \u2014 passed its version of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018. The bill reportedly authorizes about $640 billion for base defense spending \u2014 nearly $37 billion more than Trump\u2019s budget request \u2014 and another roughly $60 billion for additional war spending.\n\nBut the bill still must be reconciled with the House-passed version before it goes to Trump for his signature. And compared with the Senate bill, the House bill included about $632 billion for base defense spending and almost $65 billion for war spending, according to The Hill.\n\nOn top of that, Congress will still have to vote on a separate bill to appropriate the authorized spending, as both the House and Senate bills exceed the caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act that mandated automatic cuts in military spending.\n\nAfter the Senate authorization bill passed, the New York Times reported that \u201cwhile the proposal outlines a hefty defense budget, whether the Pentagon gets the money will be determined by congressional appropriators, and Democrats have pledged to block major increases in military spending without a similar boost for domestic programs.\u201d\n\nFor now, as we have previously written, the Defense Department will start the new fiscal year on Oct. 1 with no increase in funding. Trump signed a continuing resolution on Sept. 6 that he negotiated with Democratic leaders that kept defense spending at the same level as fiscal 2017 for the first three months of fiscal 2018.\n\nWhite House website. \u201cRemarks by President Trump to the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly.\u201d 19 Sep 2017.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics.
