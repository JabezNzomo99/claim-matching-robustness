One of the most outlandish of these rumors held that the name Pokemon Go was actually derived from \u201cPokemon Global Offensive,\u201d and the app was being used by Japan\u2019s military to map the United States and potentially lead soldiers to bombing zones in future wars.\n\nThis rumor was based on a mixture of bad jokes and false information. When Pokemon Go was released, several people joked online that the \u201cGO\u201d in the game\u2019s name stood for \u201cGlobal Offensive,\u201d a nod to another popular game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive. But this phrase is not actually part of the Pokemon apps\u2019s name: \u201cGlobal Offensive\u201d doesn\u2019t appear anywhere on the game\u2019s official web site and is not mentioned in any promotional material. As Pokemon GO is largely focused on getting players outdoors to look for Pokemon, and the game\u2019s marketing uses slogans like \u201cGet Up And Go,\u201d the \u201cGO\u201d simply points to the game\u2019s active nature.\n\nSome players took the \u201cGlobal Offensive\u201d joke too literally, however, and soon the name was attached to another rumor, that Google was passing information from the game to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Although Pokemon GO does make use of the Google Maps API, the latter company does not store this information:\n\nNo imagery or data from the game is stored in Google Maps. Niantic and Google are separate companies, so if you need any information on turning off AR mode or turning off the camera functionality in the game, the folks at Niantic can help out.\n\nWith these two rumors circulating, it was only a matter of time until someone combined the \u201cGlobal Offensive\u201d military reference with the tracking rumor to create an even larger rumor: That Japan was using this data to map the United States while planning for a future attack.\n\nOn 14 July 2016, Facebook user Puzzle Dust published the image shown at the head of this page in the \u201cDark Humor\u201d group, and while it was obviously posted as a joke, many viewers shared it as if it conveyed a meaningful warning. The image possibly was intended to reference a season 3 episode of the South Park animated TV series titled \u201cChinpokomon,\u201d in which the game is used to convert American kids into Japanese soldiers:", "lang": "en"}
