A Google reverse search led us to an article published by Al Jazeera in August 2016 which carried an image similar to the viral image. The image has been credited to Reuters photographer Joshua Roberts. Consequently, we found that Reuters had, indeed shared the image in July 2016 with the caption: \u201cDemonstrators with Black Lives Matter march during a protest in Washington, US, July 8, 2016. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts (sic)\u201d Reuters has credited the image to photographer Joshua Roberts. We found that the viral image has various similar elements as compared to the image captured by Reuters. For instance, the people seen in both the images, the background of the images, other placards seen in the two images.\n\n\n\nHowever, the placard in the centre reads \u2018Stop Killing Us\u2019 in the Reuters\u2019 image and not \u2018We are not Arabs to kill us and keep silent\u2019 as claimed in the viral image.\n\nBack in July 2016, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling were shot by the police in two separate incidents. While Castile was killed in Minnesota on 7 July 2016, Sterling was shot in Louisiana on 5 July 2016. The two incidents had led to widespread Black Lives Matter protests in different parts of US. Evidently, a 2016 image was tampered with to claim that people held placards stating \u2018We are not Arabs to kill us and keep silent\u2019 in the recent Black Lives Matter protests.
