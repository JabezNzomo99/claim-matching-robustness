The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.\"\n\nIt\u2019s tough to measure strength and confidence, but there are ways to measure wealth. We decided to look at whether America\u2019s wealth has fallen while other countries became rich.\n\nTrump\u2019s office told us he was thinking about America\u2019s $800 billion trade deficit. However, trade deficits are not a measure of national or household wealth. There is no question that trade with China has cost America jobs to the benefit of Chinese workers. But again, Trump said we made other countries rich while our wealth faded and that\u2019s a different point.\n\nEconomists measure the wealth of nations in two ways. They look at the size of their economies, the GDP, and they look at how well the average citizen is doing, or GDP per capita.\n\nThrough either lens, the wealth of the United States has not dissipated.\n\nThis chart comes from International Monetary Fund data. With its $18 trillion economy, the United States is a good one-third wealthier than its closest economic rival, China.\n\nChina\u2019s economy avoided the dip that the United States faced in the Great Recession, and it has grown at a faster rate, but America remains the wealthiest nation.\n\nSeen through the lens of GDP per capita (and factoring in the purchasing power of each currency), the United States looks even better compared to China, a country Trump often points to as the source of America\u2019s woes.\n\nChina ranks 83rd in the world on a per capita basis because while its economy is huge, it has about 1.3 billion people, many of whom are very poor.\n\nThere is one way to look at the shifting economic fortunes of the typical adult that does express a sense of what Trump described.\n\nThe international bank Credit Suisse has calculated adult wealth since 2000. Using their 2016 data, we find that the median wealth rose in each of the largest economies, including the United States, but it rose nearly three times faster in China than it did in the United States.\n\nTrump said that other countries became rich while the wealth of America \"dissipated.\" Based on the most common measures of national wealth, that is inaccurate. The United States has the world\u2019s largest economy and, when averaged across the population, the typical American does better than the people of any other country.\n\nThere is some argument to be made that the typcial Chinese worker's wealth has gone up much faster than the typical American's, but the American is still much wealthier.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
