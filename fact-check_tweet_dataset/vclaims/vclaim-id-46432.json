The video was shot in the park and many people including policemen are seen filming it.\n\nMany users on the social media shared this video claiming paranormal activity in the park.\n\n#unnatural #movement of shoulder press made the #clip #Viral in #SocialMedia. The #VIDEO clip shows two sets of gym equipment in a park swinging on its own without anyone sitting on it. Video: https://youtu.be/oG6o6A88NdU\n\nSome users shared that the event took place in Japanese Park at Rohini, New Delhi.\n\nFew shared it stating: \"Apparently this happened somewhere in UP. Received via WA. Who's exercising?? \"\n\nSo, there are a lot of doubts about the location of the incident.\n\nThe above claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched, we found that this incident took place in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, and NOT in Delhi. When the Jhansi Police got a tip-off, they launched an investigation.\n\nA longer version of the video shows the policemen moving the equipment and demonstrating that it is over greased. And when just touched, it starts to move vigorously for many seconds.\n\n\"I was accompanied by a few people and there were some bystanders too. Someone has mischievously edited and clipped the starting portion and made it viral to show that we (police) are also shocked at the 'fitness freak ghost,'\" said the officials.\n\nJhansi police tweeted a video demonstrating the equipment which started moving just by touch.\n\nJhansi police also issued a clarification that there is NO paranormal activity in the park and urged people NOT to spread rumors.\n\n\"Some mischievous person made a video of moving swing & shared on #social media. Miscreants will b hosted in a 'haunted' lockup soon #NoHostForGhost,\" tweeted Rahul Srivastav, Additional SP of Jhansi Police.\n\nWe also found a few videos on YouTube explaining the activity of the open gym equipment in the parks. The activity is NOT paranormal.\n\nThe above claim is FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
