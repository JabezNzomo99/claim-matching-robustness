Twitter and Facebook went to town with this, sharing it with more velocity than a 120kmph sneeze.\n\nSo is it real or fake? It is Rahul Gandhi and it is his voice but it's also completely fake. Here's where context is important. Team Webqoof traced the clip to the original video that was 8 minutes long, and posted by India TV in 2011. Rahul Gandhi was talking about gross malpractice that was occurring under the national rural health mission and how the BSP was misusing it. The 10-second clip takes it completely out of context and portrays a different picture.\n\nRahul Gandhi bore the brunt of a host of other fake news items from 'Pakistani flags being waved at Wayanad' to filing his nomination in the city while seated. All viral. All fake.", "lang": "en"}
