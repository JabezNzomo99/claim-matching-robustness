His wife Eniko Parrish has said that Hart is \u201cgoing to be just fine.\u201d\n\nA stand-up comedian and actor, Hart has starred in numerous films over the years, including \u201cRide Along\u201d in 2014 and \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\u201d in 2017.

News was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident, also got transported to the hospital. The third female occupant suffered only minor injuries.\n\nThe claim that Hart was paralyzed in the car crash actually comes from an article published on the parody news website LFR Solutions, which disclaims at the bottom of the article, \u201cThe stories may mimic articles found in the headlines, but rest assured that they are purely satirical.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
