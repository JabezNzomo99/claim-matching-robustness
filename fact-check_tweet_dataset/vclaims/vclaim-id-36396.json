With the counting of votes for Delhi Assembly elections underway on Tuesday, 11 February \u2013 with latest trends pointing to a massive mandate for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) \u2013 a report by Amar Ujala claims that Delhi\u2019s Shaheen Bagh area, which has become the face of anti-CAA protests in the country, wore a deserted look. But The Quint found out that the report which was being shared widely was misleading on many counts and it failed to bring forth the facts.\n\u2022 The picture was taken in the early hours before the protesters started coming in. At around 9:00 am, women protesters started coming in and by 12:00 pm, there were hundreds of protesters at the site.\n\u2022 The protesters observed a silent protest to steer-clear off any the allegation of supporting any political party.

The latest claim is that weed or cannabis can kill the novel coronavirus and save those who are infected by it. Quint FIT spoke to Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant - Internal Medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, who rubbished the claim. \u201cThere is absolutely no scientific evidence to believe any such claims. We are still figuring out the virus. Until solid research is conducted, there is no reason to go by these statements.\u201d These claims are devoid of any scientific basis and must not be believed without prior verification.

Tarek Fatah Shares Old Video as Muslims Raising Communal Slurs in Delhi Canada-based TV commentator and writer Tarek Fatah, who has a history of sharing fake news, shared a video showing people protesting on the streets of Delhi amid the Assembly elections on 8 February with a claim that Muslims chanted \u201cprovocative slogans against Hindus to boast Islamic supremacy.\u201d In the #DelhiPolls2020, Muslim goons chant a provocative slogan against Hindus to boast Islamic supremacy. \n\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHindustan me rehna Hoga,\n\n Allah-O-Akbar kehna Hoga\"\n\n\n\n(If u wish to live in India, then \n\n you'll hv to chant Allah-O-Akbar)\n\n pic.twitter.com/Bx51eF3rdZ \u2014 Tarek Fatah (@TarekFatah) February 8, 2020 But we found out that the video dates back to December 2017, when Muslims came out to protest in a rally at Chetak Circle in Rajasthan\u2019s Udaipur, where they raised slogans against Hindu organisations and demanded death for Shambhu Nath Regar, who had allegedly killed Muslim labourer Afrazul and set his body on fire.

On Thursday, 13 February, while speaking at Times Now Summit, Home Minister Amit Shah blamed the Congress for dividing the country along religious lines. A similar claim was made by Shah in Lok Sabha in December. The Quint had fact-checked his claims then. Noted Historian Srinath Raghavan took to Twitter to refute Amit Shah\u2019s claims. Raghavan in his tweet said, \u201cCongress did accept the division of the country, but not the two-nation theory. This was central to their acceptance of the partition plan. The plan stipulated that Punjab and Bengal would be partitioned if the representatives of either the Muslim-majority districts or the rest of the province voted for it. Sind's Assembly would decide which state to join. Referenda would be held in NWFP & Sylhet district of Assam (sic).\u201d Shah claims in Parliament that \"It was the Congress that divided the country on religious lines, not us\". Congress did accept the division of the country, but not the two-nation theory. This was central to their acceptance of the partition plan.
