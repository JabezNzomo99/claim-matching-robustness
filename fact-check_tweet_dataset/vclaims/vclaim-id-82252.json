And fact-checkers have debunked versions of this assertion year after year. Yet it keeps rising from the dead, and it was again uttered on national television.\n\nReaders may recall Trump\u2019s reference to the $5 million that Obama \u201cshould have taken.\u201d Despite the release of Obama\u2019s long-form Hawaiian birth certificate, the public still knows \u201cvery little about our president,\u201d Trump said in a video message posted a week before the 2012 presidential election. There still is a \u201cvery serious question\u201d about where he was born, Trump said, and he offered Obama a deal to end suspicions for good.\n\nObama gave his answer the next day, on \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u201d: \u201cThis all dates back to when we were growing up together in Kenya. We had constant run-ins on the soccer field. He wasn\u2019t very good and resented it,\u201d Obama joked. \u201cWhen we finally moved to America, I thought it would be over.\u201d When the deadline passed with no word on college and passport application records, Trump declared it a \u201cvery, very sad day.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not provide an explanation of his most recent claim. But similar claims about legal fees supposedly spent to hide records track back to reports in 2009 by the right-leaning Web site WND.com. It said Obama for America, Obama\u2019s political campaign, had spent more than $1 million to pay Perkins Coie. The law firm defended the campaign in some of the eligibility lawsuits. So we evaluated the same data.\n\nOur review of FEC data showed that Obama for America paid just over $6 million to Perkins Coie from 2008 through 2012. Overall, from the first quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2015, Obama for America paid $7.2 million. (Thanks to Post data reporter Anu Narayanswamy for helping us pull the FEC data.) The 2012 Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee did not respond to our request for legal-fee breakdowns.\n\nBirther activists have demanded the release of Obama\u2019s college application and transcript records, to prove whether he applied as a foreign student. While Trump says the $4 million in legal fees were spent to keep college records away, we found no evidence that this is accurate or that Perkins Coie defended the campaign in lawsuits asking the court to compel the release of his records from Occidental College, Columbia University or Harvard University. A 2012 legal motion was filed in Orange County Superior Court trying to compel Occidental College to release Obama\u2019s school records, but the judge rejected it and instead ordered $4,000 in sanctions to compensate the college.\n\nMost legal fees paid by a presidential campaign are for compliance review, vetting strategies, contributions and other activities, said Larry Noble, senior counsel at the nonpartisan campaign finance reform group Campaign Legal Center and former FEC general counsel: \u201cYou have to look at it [a presidential campaign] as a highly regulated business that is dealing with millions of dollars, and they have their lawyers involved in every part of it. \u2026 If they spent $4 million on legal fees, there\u2019s no way that the Obama birth certificate issue represented all the work they did. \u2026 There\u2019s so much more going on in a campaign.\u201d\n\nWhat about Trump\u2019s challenge to Obama? Noble said offsetting a political campaign\u2019s legal fees with an individual\u2019s donation would have been a campaign finance violation. Trump\u2019s $5 million would have far exceeded the $2,500 campaign contribution limit for an individual, if he gave it to Obama for America. Noble said it is questionable whether a political campaign could legally do something (i.e., disclose documents) in turn for donations to a charity.\n\nNow that Trump is running for president, will he be disclosing his college and passport application records? Trump answered that question in the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. Here\u2019s what I do. Here\u2019s what I do. I\u2019m proud of my records. But he has to do it. If he does it, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which years he is using, but FEC records show the Obama for America campaign paid more than $4 million in legal services to Perkins Coie from 2008 through 2012, the years others have referred to in similar claims. Further, there is no proof that Obama spent $4 million in legal fees (personally or through his campaign) to keep his school application or passport application records away from the public. Campaigns have in-house and outside counsel to vet a wide range of issues, not just those related to lawsuits.", "lang": "en"}
