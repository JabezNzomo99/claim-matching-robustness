But cuts at the Postal Service caused a slowdown in deliveries that meant millions of ballots were at risk of not being counted. U.S. President Donald Trump admitted he was pushing back against a fresh infusion of funding for the Postal Service, on the basis that mail-in ballots would disproportionately favor the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, fueling a partisan battle, with Democrats demanding a properly funded, well-functioning Postal Service.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 2020, Democratic Congressional candidate Allen Ellison tweeted that \u201cIf you text USPS to 50409 they will send letters to your senators and representative in support of the postal service. It literally takes under a minute.\u201d\n\nA similar exhortation posted on Facebook read: \u201cPushback pressure is working. Text USPS to 50409. This one-word text will automatically send a letter to your local representatives using Resistbot and urge them to take action. Thanks.\u201d\n\nThe process is not quite as straightforward as described in the meme above, but it is true that texting \u201cUSPS\u201d to 50409 does begin a relatively quick process under which, on your behalf, a bot sends letters to your federal political representatives based on the mailing address you provide.\n\nWe tested the bot on Aug. 18, 2020, using the SMS utility on a cellphone and providing a real name and address in Pennsylvania\u2019s 8th Congressional District. (The creators of \u201cResistbot\u201d state that the same process works on Apple\u2019s iMessage, Facebook\u2019s Messenger, Twitter, and the encrypted text message app Telegram.) The following is a step-by-step breakdown of how the bot works:\n\nFirst, the user texts \u201cUSPS\u201d to 50409. The bot automatically and immediately replies, asking if the user wants to electronically sign a \u201cSupport the USPS\u201d letter and send it to the user\u2019s political representatives. It also offers to show a sample of what the letter will look like:\n\nWhen the user replies with \u201cSAMPLE,\u201d the bot replies with a link to a screenshot of the form letter and asks if the user would like to sign it:\n\nAfter the user confirms, the bot then asks for a first and last name and a mailing address:\n\nThe bot adds the user\u2019s name to the petition and the mailing address allows it to identify the user\u2019s congressional district. The bot then automatically sends the letter via email to the corresponding members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate:\n\nFrom start to finish, the process took around five minutes with the only significant delay coming when the user awaits a verification code sent to their email address.\n\nSnopes could confirm that the letter was sent to the representatives in question because the office of one of them, U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pennsylvania, happened to respond later on with an acknowledgement that explicitly addressed the topic of the letter, the Postal Service:\n\nClaims that \u201cResistbot\u201d allowed users to quickly send letters to their political representatives were true, although it should be noted that the user is, for obvious reasons, required to actively provide a valid name, mailing address, and email address, and the letter is sent to federal representatives only, not state legislators.\n\nAccording to the Resistbot website, the bot is a \u201cproduct of the Resistbot Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization\u201d with an address in Florida. The group\u2019s Executive Director Jason Putorti sent Snopes a copy of the Resistbot Action Fund\u2019s certificate of incorporation, showing that it was registered as a non-profit organization in the state of Delaware in February 2018.", "lang": "en"}
