Responding to Wisconsin Eye TV host Steven Walters, Hintz said an alternative would have to be developed first. Then he made a statement that seemed to indict the facility, saying:\n\nWe have a 66 percent recidivism rate for the kids there, in the three years after they get out. States like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent.\"\n\nSo, 66 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates commit new offenses within three years of being released?\n\nAnd that\u2019s eight times higher than in states such as Missouri, which has been held up as a potential model for Wisconsin?\n\nWe\u2019ll see that, as national experts have stated, comparing states on juvenile recidivism is not easily done.\n\nLincoln Hills generally holds inmates as young as 13 and as old as 25, with most inmates in their mid-to late-teens; some adults are being held for crimes they committed as juveniles. Incarcerating an inmate there costs more than $100,000 a year.\n\nGroups such as Youth Justice Milwaukee, which is calling for Wisconsin\u2019s youth prisons to be closed, argue that conditions at Lincoln Hills can lead to higher recidivism -- inmates committing new offenses after they\u2019re released. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele has gone even further than Hintz, saying 75 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates fall back into criminal activity.\n\nMeanwhile, Missouri -- when facing problems similar to those at Lincoln Hills, such as fights between inmates, long stints in solitary confinement and injuries inflicted by guards -- replaced large institutions with small facilities, closer to young offenders' homes.\n\nBut the contrast in recidivism between the two states is not how Hintz portrays it.\n\nTo back Hintz\u2019s claim, his office cited a January 2017 report by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It says that according to the latest available data, Lincoln Hills has a three-year recidivism rate of 63 percent. That is, 278 juveniles were released from Lincoln Hills in 2011 and 63 percent returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, by 2014.\n\nSo, Hintz\u2019s claim of a 66 percent recidivism rate at Lincoln Hills is high by only three percentage points.\n\nMissouri\u2019s definition of recidivism is roughly similar to Wisconsin\u2019s, but has four parts. It includes youths who are sent back to the juvenile system, are sent to adult prison, are put on probation, or are put into a 120-day program.\n\nBut the latest State of Missouri figures show Missouri\u2019s three-year recidivism rate, for 2013 to 2016, is 30 percent. That\u2019s far less than Lincoln Hills\u2019 63 percent. But it\u2019s also much higher than the 8 percent Hintz claimed.\n\nThat lower rate applies only to the first part of Missouri\u2019s recidivism definition -- youths who commit new offenses and are sent back to the youth system.\n\nThere are also other problems with comparing Lincoln Hills to Missouri:\n\nThose create a major apples-to-oranges problem for Hintz\u2019s statement, particularly the fact Missouri\u2019s count includes many less serious offenders than Lincoln Hills.\n\nHintz says Wisconsin's Lincoln Hills youth prison has a \"66 percent recidivism rate,\" while \"states like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent.\"\n\nHe is essentially correct on Wisconsin. The latest figures show that 63 percent of Lincoln Hills offenders are returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, within three years of being released.\n\nBut the comparison to Missouri misses on several counts. Missouri reports a three-year youth recidivism rate of 30 percent, not 8 percent -- and even that is misleading. While Lincoln Hills incarcerates only serious male offenders, Missouri\u2019s youth correctional system includes males and females who commit offenses ranging from serious crimes to truancy. So, Hintz is comparing two significantly different populations.\n\nHintz\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.\n\nFederal Judge James Peterson: We\u2019ve rated a claim that Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, \"has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills.\" Mostly True.\n\nMilwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn: In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft \"get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court\" on holding suspects, \"a stolen car gets zero points.\" Mostly False.\n\nState Sen. Leah Vukmir (R-Brookfield), a 2018 candidate for U.S. Senate: In 2016, there were 5,570 people in Wisconsin \"who committed crimes on probation and they were not revoked.\" Half True.\n\nFederal Judge James Peterson: \"Ted Kaczynski has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills.\" Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
