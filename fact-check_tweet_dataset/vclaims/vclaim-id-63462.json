A screenshot posted by a netizen in the comments section shows the page asks participants to further share the fake post to 10 FB pages as a \u201cfinal step\u201d in the giveaway.\n\nThe first post currently has over 46,000 shares and over 91,000 comments, and the other, more than 18,000 shares and over 28,000 comments.\n\nThe comments section of the fake giveaway posts shows thousands of netizens following the page\u2019s instructions, but a number of people have also called out the page for its sham giveaway. FB has since blocked the Messenger platform of Hp Laptops Giveaway Business for 24 hours after people started reporting the sham posts.\n\nOfficial FB pages or accounts of products, celebrities, or global brands usually have blue check or verified badge given by FB. This ensures that a specific account is legitimate and has been vetted for authenticity by FB itself. Hp Laptops Giveaway Business does not have that badge.", "lang": "en"}
