Several Facebook and Twitter users have posted it with the claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ensuring that there is no shortage of essential services during the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nOn April 2, a Facebook user posted the viral video along with text in Hindi, \u201cPM\u2019s idea to fight Corona.

This video has been viewed over 70,000 times. (archive link)\n\nAlt News analysed the video using InVid, a video verification too, and found that it was also uploaded by a YouTube account in 2013.\n\nWhile we couldn\u2019t authenticate where the video is from but it appears to be of Indian Railway\u2019s roll-on roll-off (RORO) service. According to Indian Railways\u2019 Annual Report (2011-12), the service was started in 1999 by Konkan Railways.\n\nIn 2012, The Hindu Business Line reported that RORO is a service that enables loaded trucks to be carried directly on railway wagons between two destinations. According to the report, in 2011-12, Konan Railway Corporation carried more than 35,000 trucks through its RORO service which added Rs 35.64 crore to the revenue.\n\nMumbai Mirror reported in 2018 that Indian Railways commenced RORO service on Central and Western Railways for the first time. According to the report, RORO service can carry 50 trucks at a time and save approximately 10 litres of diesel per kilometre.\n\nThus, a video that could be traced back to at least 2013 was shared with the false claim that trucks carrying essential items are being transported in trains as per an initiative by PM Modi. However, the video is unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
