It has also been overlaid with the song 'Ay Watan Tera Ishara Aa Gaya.'\n\nA voice speaking in Pashto can be heard at the beginning saying, \"these are all Mujahideens, and they are ready to go to Kashmir for jihad.\"\n\nToward the end of the clip the man shooting the video and carrying a rifle and wearing a black vest can be seen.\n\nThe video has angered Twitter users in India.\n\nClick here to view an archived version of the tweet.\n\nIt was also tweeted by Bharatiya Janata Party member \n\nMajor Surendra Poonia.\n\nClick here to view an archived version of the tweet.\n\nBOOM decided to trace the video using open source data.\n\nAs visible in the clip and pointed out in the replies, a policemen was visible in the first few frames of the video.\n\nIn addition, one can spot a metal trunk and other luggage, which led us to believe that the video was probably shot on the campus of a police or armed forces training institute in Pakistan.\n\nSeveral frames of a red and beige brick building are visible when the camera pans in the video.\n\nA large number of men in the video can also be seen wearing Pathani suits or Pathani Kurtas.\n\nTherefore, we decided to restrict our search to police training institutes in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region.\n\nWe zeroed in on the Police Training College (PTC) Hangu at \n\nKohat Road, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\n\nA photograph of the main building is visible on the dashboard of the institute's website. The video appears to be taken at the back of one of the buildings which is adjacent to a ground.\n\nBOOM also found a Facebook page - PTC Hangu. The page though is not verified.\n\nWe then used whopostedwhat.com - a free Facebook graph search and in the Location field entered 'PTC Hangu' showing us posts from people on Facebook who mentioned the institute.\n\nAmong the search results was a profile of one Nasrullah Khan - the man who recorded the original video.\n\nThe Man Who Shot The Video\n\nNasrullah Khan posted the video on September 1, 2019. The clip is the same as the video that has gone viral including the audio and text that has been overlaid on it.\n\nThe image of weapon is a stock image photo that has been described as an AK 47 online.\n\nKhan's Facebook profile says he works with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police.\n\nHis current Facebook profile picture shows him wearing a uniform of the institute.\n\nBOOM did a side by side comparison where he can be seen in the video with his Facebook profile photo.\n\nIt is not clear whether Nasrullah Khan posted the video out of hubris or as a joke as multiple comments on the video suggest the police trainees were being deployed for Muharram duty. Muharram will be observed on September 10, 2019.\n\nOn September 4, 2019, the Facebook page PTC Hangu replied to BOOM's query about the video and confirmed it was shot at the college. The page also said that the men in the video were not terrorists and that they were being deployed for Muharram duty.", "lang": "en"}
