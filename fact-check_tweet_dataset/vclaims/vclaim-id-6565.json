You, your wife and your children will all be receiving a stimulus bonus of $612 each to spend however you see fit inside the United States. The program, called \u201cTax Relief For Deserving Americans,\u201d will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead. The White House Communication and Propaganda Office released a statement about the program and how it will impact the economy: While deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being \u201creported\u201d by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of how much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Mr. trump has decided people would rather focus on spending some money than the nonsense on the \u201cnews,\u201d and has therefore authorized the release of $612 each for every legal American from a working family.\n\nOf course, there is no \u201cWhite House Communication and Propaganda Office,\u201d nor did President Trump decree \u201cdeserving\u201d Americans were set to receive a bonus of any sort. Last Line of Defense\u2018s \u201cAbout\u201d page includes a disclaimer noting that the site\u2019s material is satirical in nature:\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real.\n\nA nearly verbatim copy of this fake news article was recirculated by web sites such as AmericanRevolution24.com and ConsDaily.com in April 2017 with one notable change: President Trump was allegedly giving $888, not $612, to the American people. This, of course, was also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
