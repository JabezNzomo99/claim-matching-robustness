There are no reports of buses torched in this area. The claim that buses were burnt in my presence is false,\u201d said Khan.\n\nAlt News contacted a local from Abul Fazal Nagar, Mohammed Sami, who attended the protest in the Shaheen Bagh.

According to him, the vehicles were burnt at around 4 pm. \u201cThe violent protests took place within a 4-kilometre radius from the location where Amanatulla Khan was protesting. However, according to my observation, the protests in Shaheen Bagh were peaceful in nature,\u201d said Yadav.\n\nThe journalist further stated, \u201cThe men who were burning the buses and destroying private vehicles didn\u2019t look like students. Many of them were drunk.\u201d\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on Twitter and found photographs uploaded by Sidharth Ravi and Kallol Bhattacherjee, journalists from The Hindu. According to these posts, the buses we set ablaze at around 4:45 pm.

There are no reports of buses being torched in Shaheen Bagh by the media.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the AAP MLA was seen in New Friends Colony where the violent protests took place or that he was a part of the mob that torched buses is false.\n\nOn December 16, BJP filed an FIR against Dy CM of Delhi Manish Sisodia, AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan and other AAP leaders for being involved in riots at Jamia Millie Islamia on the previous day.", "lang": "en"}
