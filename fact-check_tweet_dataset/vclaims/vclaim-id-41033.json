Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nThe post doing rounds on Facebook shared by a user named Sheryce Sanders Malone reads: \u201cA natural remedy that kills coronavirus. Start pot of boiling water on stove. Cut peels of oranges or lemons or both \u2013 your choice. Add sea salt to pot of boiling water. Add orange or lemon peels to pot of boiling hot water. Boil on high for a few minutes. When water and ingredients in pot have been brought to a boil, turn down the heat, put your face down to pot and breathe in steam. Do this for 15 minutes or as much as you can stand.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nWhen Vishvas News started its investigation, we visited the \u2018Advice for Public\u2018 page of World Health Organization (WHO) website. There was no mention of inhaling steam as coronavirus cure.\n\nWe further searched on the website of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on its page \u2018How to protect yourself\u2019. We didn\u2019t find any such related information as mentioned in the viral post.\n\nWe also looked for viral claim on the page \u2018Caring for Yourself at Home\u2019 on the website of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There was no mention of the inhaling steam claim in the page.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Vimal N. Ayurveda doctor, Ministry of AYUSH. He said: \u201cNo, boiling orange peels, onion and sea salt and inhaling it for 15 minutes will not kill coronavirus. This is a fake claim. However, one can take preventive measures to protect themselves from coronavirus, but this no cure of the virus.\u201d\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named Sheryce Sanders Malone. When we performed the social scanning of the user we found that the user is based out of Georgia.\n\nDisclaimer: The #CoronavirusFacts database records fact-checks published since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.
