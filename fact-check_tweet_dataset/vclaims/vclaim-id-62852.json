This is the beach today in Raleigh, North Carolina.\"\n\nWe have found posts that put the image in other locations, including one that claimed it was taken \"today at the beach in Indianapolis, IN.\"\n\nThey were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a photo of a beach in Brazil in 2013. The caption of a similar shot from Reuters says: \"Catholic faithful camp out on Copacabana Beach to participate in an all-night vigil before Pope Francis gives mass to those attending World Youth Day, in Rio de Janeiro.\"\n\nOther photos from that day are here.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously fact-checked a claim that a different photo from this event showed Jacksonville Beach in Florida during the pandemic. Of course, that wasn\u2019t true either.\n\nAnd, um, Raleigh isn't on the coast of North Carolina.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.\n\nUpdate (July 8, 2020): This story has been updated to reflect that social media posts are falsely claiming this photo from Brazil was taken in a number of different locations.", "lang": "en"}
