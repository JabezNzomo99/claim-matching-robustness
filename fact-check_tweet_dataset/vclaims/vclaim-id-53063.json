Only he can have such disgusting thoughts. And yet, for a few days, the BJP and the hypocrite media are targeting respected Rahul ji saying that he was making fun of the Army.\n\nIn another video, PM can be heard saying, \u201cAs much courage the army has, a trader has more courage than that. \u201d\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that it is edited.\n\nWhen we took the keyframes of the video and put them through Reverse Image Search, we found the extender version of the same video on YouTube.\n\nUpon hearing the entire speech, we noticed that the viral video is just a small clip with has been taken out of context. The viral clip can be found at 0:05 sec of the video.\n\nHere\u2019s what he is said, \u201cLook at the young man in the army, he goes to battle to die. Because he gets paid? He doesn\u2019t go to the battlefield prepared to die because he gets a salary. He is prepared to die because he loves this soil. \u201d\n\nWe found that the second video is from 2014 when Primi Minister Modi was addressing a traders association in Delhi.\n\nThe viral statement can be found at 1:01:53 time code of the video.\n\n\u201cAs much courage the army has, a trader has more courage than that. Anyone without risktaking ability cannot be a trader. He\u2019ll do labor but he can\u2019t do trade\u2026even if he is a small trader, he has high risk-taking ability, \u201d he said.\n\nHence, from the above information, it is clear that a quote from PM Modi\u2019s old speeches was taken out and shared without the context.
