The stories on other sites all lead back to a story headlined \u201cHUGE LEGAL NEWS: SCOTUS Rules Trump Can Build The Wall WITHOUT Congress,\u201d on ourlandofthefree.com.\n\nAn immediate tip-off that this website might publish satire is the URL of the story, which says \u201cscotus-rules-trump-has-the-iq-of-an-amoeba.\u201d\n\nAlthough the story isn\u2019t labeled satire, the \u201cAbout Us\u201d tab of ourlandofthefree.com says: \u201cOurlandofthefree.com makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality. All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they\u2019re not. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nBut even without noticing the site\u2019s disclaimer, readers could find a number of suspicious elements in the story.\n\nThe apparent spokesperson for the Supreme Court is referred to as \u201cWHOIP Director Jeff Derpinger.\u201d But an internet search for that name and title only returns stories from ourlandofthefree.com and other satirical websites, such as thelastlineofdefense.org.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s apparent logic for its fake decision doesn\u2019t make much sense either.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump found a loophole in the Evolution Clause that allows the President to make decisions of national security concerning our borders,\u201d the story says. \u201cIn a decision in 1826, Chief Justice Jonathon Lieberston noted that the decision to secure the borders of Texas after the Alamo came at great national expense but that the benefit outweighed the cost.\u201d\n\nThere is no \u201cEvolution Clause\u201d in the Constitution, and no chief justice, or associate justice for that matter, who has ever been named \u201cJonathan Lieberston.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nAdmin. \u201cHUGE LEGAL NEWS: SCOTUS Rules Trump Can Build The Wall WITHOUT Congress.\u201d Flashnewsusa.com. 25 Aug 2017.\n\nAdmin. \u201cHUGE LEGAL NEWS: SCOTUS Rules Trump Can Build The Wall WITHOUT Congress.\u201d Patriotusa.website. 25 Aug 2017.\n\nEagleton, Flagg. \u201cHUGE LEGAL NEWS: SCOTUS Rules Trump Can Build The Wall WITHOUT Congress.\u201d Ourlandofthefree.com. 24 Aug 2017.", "lang": "en"}
