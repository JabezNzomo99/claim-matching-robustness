Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., have made headlines.\n\nMost notably, President Donald Trump said that Omar, a U.S. citizen who immigrated as a Somali refugee, said that al-Qaida was \"wonderful.\" PolitiFact rated Trump\u2019s statement False \u2014 he twisted her words.\n\nOn Facebook, some users are pushing back against the notion that Omar has downplayed attacks by terrorist groups. A photo published on Facebook July 21 claims that Omar \"voted yes to provide further funding for the 9/11 First Responders Victims Fund,\" while Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky \"voted no.\"\n\n\"Who hates America again?\" reads the photo, which includes headshots of both politicians and was shared hundreds of times.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, so we wanted to check it out. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nPolitiFact reached out to the Facebook user who shared the photo asking for their source. We\u2019ll update this story if we hear back.\n\nCongress created the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund in 2001 to pay the people and relatives harmed or killed during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The original program operated until 2004.\n\nThe fund was revived between 2011 and 2016 with the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. In December 2015, President Barack Obama signed a bill that extended the fund until 2020.\n\nFor the past several months, lawmakers have been deciding whether to extend the fund through 2090 \u2014 and Paul has come under attack for his action on the bill.\n\nA quick Google search for the Victim Compensation Fund surfaced several recent articles about how Paul blocked the Senate from extending the fund July 17. The House passed the bill July 12.\n\nWe checked footage from the session. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., asked the Senate to pass the bill without debate, and Paul objected.\n\n\"It has long been my feeling that we need to address our massive debt in this country,\" he said. \"Therefore any spending that we are approaching, any new program that's going to have the longevity of 70, 80 years, should be offset by cutting spending that\u2019s less valuable. We need to, at the very least, have this debate.\"\n\nThe senator\u2019s objection delayed a vote on the bill to July 23. Rand\u2019s move didn\u2019t technically constitute a vote \u2014 he was objecting to Gillibrand\u2019s motion to pass the bill without debate and put it on the unanimous consent docket. It would be more accurate to say he stalled the bill\u2019s passage, even if that did effectively kill the legislation for the time being.\n\nThe Facebook post was shared before the Senate took its full vote. On July 23, Rand and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, were the two senators who voted against the bill. Both proposed amendments; Rand\u2019s would have required offsets for money spent on the fund, and Lee\u2019s would have restricted the extension to 10 years. Both were defeated in roll call votes.\n\nAs for Omar, we checked the voting record and found that the congresswoman voted in favor of the bill July 12.\n\nA Facebook photo claims Omar \"voted yes\" to pass a bill extending the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund while Sen. Rand Paul \"voted no.\"\n\nThe congressional voting record shows that Omar did vote for the measure in the House. At the time the photo was published, Paul objected to a motion to pass the bill in the Senate without debate. The move did not technically constitute a nay vote, but it did effectively halt the legislation. Later, he did officially vote against the bill \u2014 he was one of two Republican votes against it.", "lang": "en"}
