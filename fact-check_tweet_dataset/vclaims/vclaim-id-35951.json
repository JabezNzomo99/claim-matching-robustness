Rowling is the first person to fall off Forbes magazine\u2019s billionaires list due to charitable giving.\n\nRowling\u2019s departure from the Forbes World Billionaires list was precipitated by her charitable giving and Britain\u2019s high tax rates. Forbes confirmed that Rowling is not the first billionaire to get bumped off the list for charitable giving.\n\nForbes magazine publishes an annual ranking of the world\u2019s wealthiest people, all of whom have a documented net worth of at least $1 billion U.S. dollars. The Forbes World\u2019s Billionaires list, which ranks its members from most wealthy to least, was topped in 2018 by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos with an estimated $112 billion.\n\nRowling, author of the popular \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fantasy novels, debuted on the 2004 Billionaires list as the first billionaire author at $1 billion. In 2012, she fell off the list due to a combination of charitable giving and high tax rates.\n\n\u201cNew information about Rowlings\u2019 estimated $160 million in charitable giving combined with Britain\u2019s high tax rates bumped the Harry Potter scribe from our list this year,\u201d wrote Forbes.\n\nRowling founded the Children\u2019s High Level Group, now called Lumos, in 2005 to help \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d children in orphanages around the world. Through her charitable trust, Volant, she has also donated to organizations that support women, children, and the alleviation of poverty.\n\n\u201cYou have a moral responsibility when you\u2019ve been given far more than you need, to do wise things with it and give intelligently,\u201d the Telegraph quoted Rowling as saying about charitable giving in 2011.\n\nHowever, Forbes confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that Rowling is not the first billionaire to fall off the list due, in part, to charitable donations. Luisa Kroll, an assistant managing editor at Forbes, pointed to several individuals whose philanthropy cost them their spots on the list prior to Rowling, including American Century Investments founder James Stowers in 2001 and Golden West Financial Corporation founder Herb Sandler in 2006.\n\nChuck Feeney, the Duty Free Shoppers co-founder who was worth $1.9 billion in 1991, is another example. His Atlantic Philanthropies has distributed $8 billion in grants from 1981 to 2016.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the person we site [sic] as truly trying to give it all away,\u201d Kroll told the Caller in an email.\n\nThough Rowling is no longer included on the Forbes World Billionaires list, the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author still has a substantial fortune. As of July 9, Forbes estimates that Rowling had already earned $92 million in 2019.", "lang": "en"}
