It was prepared for acting Director of National Intelligence Rick Grenell.\n\nThe document\u2019s release comes as the Justice Department seeks to end the prosecution of former Trump administration National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nFlynn resigned from his position in Trump\u2019s administration in 2017 over contacts he\u2019d had with senior Russian officials that may have addressed lifting sanctions on Russia that had been imposed by Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama. Flynn had denied that he talked with the Russians even though he had.\n\nEventually, Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI and became a cooperating witness in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, which probed Russian election interference and possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\n\nBut Flynn later hired new lawyers who took an aggressive posture, seeking internal FBI memos and, eventually, a dismissal of charges. After Attorney General William Barr asked Jeff Jensen, the U.S. attorney in St. Louis, to review the case, Jensen concluded that a dismissal of the case was warranted, and Barr agreed.\n\nThe Justice Department now argues that the FBI had no basis to continue investigating Flynn after failing to find illegal acts. Flynn\u2019s answers during the FBI interview were equivocal, not false, and weren\u2019t relevant to the investigation, the department said.\n\nThe most notable name on the newly released list of officials who requested an unmasking is Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who was then the vice president. And the political parties have sharply different takes on what the list means.\n\nBiden spokesman Andrew Bates said that that \"these documents simply indicate the breadth and depth of concern across the American government\" and that the declassified documents \"confirm that all normal procedures were followed.\"\n\nHowever, many Republicans, including the senators that released the documents, say the list of names forms the core of an Obama administration conspiracy to target Flynn and undercut the incoming national security adviser. Grassley said the document\u2019s release means the \"focus on these issues is even more important now.\"\n\nWe wanted to explain what unmasking is and fact-check some of the claims about it from both sides.\n\nSenior government officials can request the identity of an American citizen who has appeared unnamed in intelligence reports. The idea is that national security officials, at least in some cases, need to know the identity in order to fully understand the intelligence being presented to them. That process is called \"unmasking.\"\n\nUsually, American identities are protected in reports on the communications, such as intercepted telephone calls, involving people under investigation or surveillance. This is called \"minimization,\" and it\u2019s partly why data collection from Section 215 of the Patriot Act is considered legal and not unduly intrusive. Americans\u2019 communication is not monitored unless they are under investigation, but it\u2019s possible to be caught up unintentionally if they communicate with someone who is under investigation or a foreign individual under surveillance.\n\nThe new document lists unmasking requests that produced Flynn\u2019s name from intelligence collected by the National Security Agency, though surveillance from other agencies can be subject to unmasking as well.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the document released by the senators did not find any wrongdoing in the requests for unmasking. The document says, \"Each individual (on the list) was an authorized recipient of the original report and the unmasking was approved through NSA\u2019s standard process, which includes a review of the justification for the request.\"\n\nWere top Obama officials including Biden given access to Flynn\u2019s name through unmasking?\n\nBiden and others were offered access to Flynn\u2019s name through the unmasking process, according to the document released May 13.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was essentially accurate when he said that \"Biden and more than a dozen Obama administration officials requested and received the power to unmask Flynn.\u2019\"\n\nIn addition to Biden, the newly unclassified document includes almost two dozen other officials in senior Obama administration positions and a few more that have had their names redacted.\n\nSeveral of the officials on this list were well-known figures within the administration, including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, FBI Director James Comey, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power. Others were more obscure.\n\nThe only potential inaccuracy we could find in Paul\u2019s remark is that some of these requests may have been made in the officials\u2019 names by aides, according to the New York Times.\n\nMichael Morell, who served as CIA director earlier in Obama\u2019s presidency, told the Times that in some cases, requests logged as coming from a senior official may instead have been requested by an officer tasked with briefing that senior official.\n\nDoes the unmasking list show that top officials \"knew\" that concerns about Flynn were a \"lie\"?\n\nThe pro-Trump social media personalities Diamond and Silk drew this conclusion in a Facebook post that featured images of the list of Obama administration officials:\n\n\"Obama knew. Clinton knew. Biden knew. Comey knew. Brennan knew. McCabe knew. Strzok knew. Clapper knew. Rosenstein knew. FBI knew. DOJ knew. CIA knew. State knew. They all knew it was a lie, a witch-hunt, a scandal, a plot, a conspiracy, a hoax. #ObamaGate #SubpoenaObama.\"\n\nThis assertion is inaccurate in several ways.\n\nFirst, four of the officials on the Diamond and Silk list aren\u2019t actually included in the unmasking list. One is Hillary Clinton, who was a losing presidential candidate by then and had no position in the U.S. government. Also not on the list are former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI agent Peter Strzok, and Rod Rosenstein, who was at the time U.S. Attorney for Maryland and later became deputy attorney general.\n\nSecond, Diamond and Silk ignore a key sentence of the unmasking document \u2014 that \"while the principals are identified below, we cannot confirm they saw the unmasked information.\"\n\nThird, there is no guarantee that Flynn would have been directly targeted by these requests. Some of the requests may have involved inquiries about foreign officials who were talking about Flynn, the Times reported.\n\nFinally, requesting an unmasking does not prove that any of these officials \"knew\" that concerns about Flynn were a \"lie.\" All it meant is that they were able to see the raw intelligence with a name attached so they could better assess it.\n\nExperts say that there\u2019s a strong argument that the unmasking inquiries were justified.\n\n\"Given what we know thus far, I just don\u2019t see how the unmasking requests in this context are anything out of the ordinary,\" said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas who specializes in national security law. \"It hardly seems unreasonable, given what was in the intelligence reports, that senior government officials would\u2019ve wanted to know the identity of the unnamed U.S. person in order to understand the significance of the intercepts.\"\n\nFormer Obama National Security spokesman Tommy Vietor tweeted, \"The people who \u2018unmasked\u2019 Flynn are top national security aides. It's literally their job to understand intel to help make informed decisions. If the DNI is suggesting unmasking is wrong, why did the Trump admin unmask identities 17,000 times in 2018?\"\n\nThe numbers Vietor cites are basically accurate, according to data released annually by the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nAs those reports show, there were 9,217 unmasking requests made of the National Security Agency between September 2015 and August 2016, and 9,529 in calendar year 2017.\n\nThe number rose to 16,721 in calendar year 2018 and 10,012 in calendar year 2019.\n\nFirst, unmasking is not an unusual practice; on average, more than two dozen requests are made every day somewhere in the government.\n\nSecond, the number of unmasking requests actually rose under the Trump administration, substantially over the late-Obama-era baseline in 2018 and more modestly over that baseline in 2019.", "lang": "en"}
