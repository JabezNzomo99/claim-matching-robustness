The theory claimed that laser-caused fires were making way for a high-speed rail system.\n\nSo, for starters, none of the pictures are from the current wildfires in California.\n\nCoudrey\u2019s 2018 tweet described the photos in question as \u201c[u]ser submitted photos on Facebook of the California fires\u201d that \u201cshow weird beams of light emiting from the sky causing fires, destruction & property damage.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s some background we found on each of the four photos used in the meme:\n\u2022 The first photo, on the left in the meme, is from SpaceX\u2019s May 2018 launch of a rocket, Falcon 9.\n\u2022 The photo on the bottom in the middle is from the Klamath National Forest and was taken of a fire in northern California in May 2018. The agency later responded to Twitter users questioning the photo and noted that what has been misperceived as a beam was actually lens flare.\n\u2022 Above that photo is an image that has been around since January 2018 and was circulated to suggest that a meteor in Michigan was actually an energy weapon attack. A report from Snopes at the time noted that an oil refinery in Ohio conducted a controlled fire around the same time, which some had evidently tried to link to the meteor.\n\u2022 The fourth image, on the right, has appeared on blog posts that suggest \u201cdirect energy weapons\u201d were behind the Woolsey fire in California in November 2018. A utility company whose equipment is believed to have been responsible for igniting the fire reached a settlement last year with Los Angeles County and other public agencies over the blaze.\n\nIn short, as we said, none of the photos in the meme are recent images from the California wildfires, and there\u2019s no evidence that any of the fires were caused by \u201cpowerful lasers.\u201d\n\nOfficials have said lightning, plus the extreme heat and dry conditions, are to blame for the fires.\n\nAccording to CAL FIRE, California\u2019s fire authority, there have been nearly 14,000 lightning strikes since Aug. 15. Since then, there have been more than 700 new wildfires, which have collectively burned more than 1.32 million acres. There are seven reported fatalities, and nearly 1,700 structures have been destroyed.\n\nThe National Park Service has estimated that 10% of all wildfires in the U.S. are caused by lightning strikes.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
