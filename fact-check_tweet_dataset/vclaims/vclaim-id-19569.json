The claim is misleading; longer videos of the same incident show the same woman criticising police and telling them to back off, after pleading with the protesters to leave.\n\nThe video has been published repeatedly on social media, for example here on YouTube on July 28, 2019 where it has been viewed nearly 700 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201cAn elderly woman, who is a resident of Yuen Long, cried and asked black-shirted terrorists to leave and stop attacking police (July 27, 2019)\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video was filmed here on Castle Peak Road in Yuen Long, Hong Kong.\n\nProtesters clashed with police in Yuen Long on July 27 at a demonstration against suspected triad gangs who beat up pro-democracy demonstrators there one week previously. Here is an AFP report about the protest.\n\nThe 34-second video shows an elderly woman screaming at protesters in Cantonese, saying: \u201cGo away, walk off.. Leave!\u201d\n\nAt the three second mark, she can be seen blocking black-shirted protesters with her body, waving her arms and brandishing her walking stick.\n\nAt the nine second mark, several protesters in helmets, goggles and face masks can be heard saying to her: \u201cPlease go back to the sidewalk... It\u2019s very dangerous here.\u201d\n\nRiot police with shields, helmets and gas masks, can be seen standing on the opposite side of the road.\n\nThe same video has been viewed tens of thousands of times here on YouTube alongside a similar claim, and here on Facebook with the following Chinese language caption, which translates to English as:\n\n\"These rioters are pushing people in Yuen Long to breaking point.\u201d\n\nA longer version of the video, with extra footage, has been viewed more than a million times here and here on Facebook and here on YouTube alongside a claim that states: \u201cElderly woman asks \u2018yellow ribbons\u2019 to leave and stop messing up Yuen Long\u201d.\n\nYellow ribbons have been a symbol of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong since 2014, when the city\u2019s major thoroughfares were blocked for nearly three months during the Umbrella Movement, AFP reported here in October 2014.\n\nThe claim is misleading; other videos of the same incident show the same woman criticising police and telling them to back off, after pleading with the protesters to leave.\n\nIn this clip captured by Campus TV, the old woman turned to face police after telling protesters to leave.\n\nShe can be seen walking towards police at around the one minute and 15 second mark of the clip, saying, \u201cYou can shoot me blind.. I'm not afraid of dying.\"\n\nThis video published on Facebook on July 28 shows the same scene filmed from a different angle.\n\nThe same woman, whose face is blurred, can be seen standing between the protesters and police at the same location in Yuen Long.\n\nBetween the three to 11 second mark, the woman can be seen facing protesters and saying, \u201cPlease leave.. I don\u2019t believe in police. Please leave soon, be good. You have a long life ahead, while mine is near the end.\u201d\n\nTo which someone from the protesters\u2019 camp responded, \u201cWe\u2019ve promised not to cause any trouble.\u201d\n\nAt the 18 second mark, she faces police and says, \u201cLeave! Back off! You\u2019ve only arrested 12 people!\u201d\n\nA police announcement is broadcast at the 20 second mark saying: \u201cStop all unauthorised gatherings immediately and disperse peacefully.\u201d\n\nImmediately afterwards, some protesters can be heard saying, \u201cWe are only here because you colluded with triads.\u201d\n\nLaurel Chor, a Hong Kong-based freelance journalist who has been following the protests, took a photo of the same woman, as seen in this July 28 tweet.\n\nThe tweet is captioned: \u201cI got this shot of her yesterday. She was furious and fearless.\u201d\n\nChor told AFP in Twitter DM on July 29: \u201cWhen I saw her, she was yelling at police and telling them to not be violent towards protesters. She was definitely angry with them.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
