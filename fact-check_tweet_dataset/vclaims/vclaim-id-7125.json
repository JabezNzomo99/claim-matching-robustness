No, that's not true: the story about the missing nuke was made up by a military satire website that was commenting on the loss of a machine gun and box of grenades at that base. No nuke is missing, that part of the story is not real.\n\nThe missing nuke story originated from an article published on May 19, 2018 by Duffel Blog that was titled \"Minot Air Force Base launches search for missing Minuteman nuclear missile\" (archived here) and which opened:\n\nMINOT AIR FORCE BASE, N.D. -- Airmen stationed at a North Dakota base known for housing the land-based leg of the nuclear triad are frantically searching for a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile that went missing earlier this week, sources confirmed today. \"It was just here,\" said Lt. Jenna Singleton, a missileer. \"Where the hell could this thing could've gone?\" The 78,000-lb nuclear-tipped warhead was found to be missing during a standard inventory check on Wednesday. The incident came just days after Minot reported it had lost a box of grenades, an M240 machine-gun, four Humvees, and its commanding officer.\n\nIt is true that an M240 machine gun and a box of grenade launcher ammo recently went missing at the base:\n\nBut the website Duffelblog.com is a military-themed satire website which sports following legal disclaimer on its 'about' page:\n\nWe are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet.

The gaffe was cleared up in May 2012 when Duffel Blog staff successfully conducted an airborne assault on the offices of The Onion News Network so that others would know \"The Onion was actually the civilian version of Duffel Blog.\"\n\nSo don't fall for any of their stories...\n\nWe wrote about duffelblog.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Navy NOT To Christen Ship USS Tig Ol Bitties After People Vote Online\n\u2022 Fake News: Presidential Helicopter Marine One Did NOT Crash Into The White House\n\u2022 Fake News: Kim Jong-un Did NOT Defect To South Korea\n\u2022 Fake News: Army Did NOT Calls For 200,000-man Detail to Fill Sandbags on US-Mexico Border\n\u2022 Fake News: Pentagon Is NOT Partnering With Uber For On-demand Helicopter Extraction", "lang": "en"}
