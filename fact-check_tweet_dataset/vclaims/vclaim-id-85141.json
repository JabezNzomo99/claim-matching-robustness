Earlier in his campaign, he indicated he would round up the 11 million undocumented people \u201cin a humane way\u201d and deport them. Then later, he said he would prioritize some of them.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019ve done well, they\u2019re going out and they\u2019re coming back in legally. . . . We\u2019re rounding \u2019em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they\u2019re going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn\u2019t sound nice. But not everything is nice,\u201d Trump said in September 2015 on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d when asked what he would do with the 11 million to 12 million illegal immigrants in the country.\n\nThroughout the primaries, Trump repeated that all illegal immigrants \u201chave to go\u201d and \u201cwill go out\u201d and that \u201csome will come back, the best, through a process.\u201d He praised the Eisenhower-era \u201cOperation Wetback,\u201d an aggressive federal effort (named after an offensive word for Mexicans) to remove illegal Mexican immigrants from the Southwest.\n\nThen, in August 2016, it seemed as though Trump was changing his mind on deportations. Trump assembled a panel of Hispanic advisers, who wanted him to reconsider his stance on mass deportations. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, had said that Trump\u2019s stance on mass deportations was \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 31, 2016, Trump delivered a major immigration speech and clarified that under his presidency, all people in the country illegally would be subject to deportations but that he would prioritize certain removals \u2014 including visa overstays and \u201ccriminal aliens,\u201d who are noncitizens convicted of crimes. Trump still left room for deporting all 11 million: \u201cAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, in 2012, Trump had a different view on deporting undocumented immigrants, CNN\u2019s KFile found. Trump said in a June 2012 interview with CNBC that he was \u201cprobably down the middle on that\u201d and that \u201cI also understand how, as an example, you have people in this country for 20 years, they\u2019ve done a great job, they\u2019ve done wonderfully, they\u2019ve gone to school, they\u2019ve gotten good marks, they\u2019re productive \u2014 now we\u2019re supposed to send them out of the country, I don\u2019t believe in that.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cWe have to make a whole new set of standards. And when people come in, they have to come in legally \u2014 \u201d\n\n Host Chuck Todd: \u201cSo you\u2019re going to split up families?\u201d\n\n Trump: \u201cChuck.\u201d\n\n Todd: \u201cYou\u2019re going to deport children \u2014 \u201d\n\n Trump: \u201cChuck. No, no. We\u2019re going to keep the families together. We have to keep the families together.\u201d\n\n Todd: \u201cBut you\u2019re going to keep them together out \u2014 \u201d\n\n Trump: \u201cBut they have to go. But they have to go.\u201d\n\nTrump also has said that he believes it is wrong for the children of illegal immigrants (also referred to as \u201canchor babies\u201d) to automatically receive citizenship if they are born in the United States. He said he would \u201ctest it out in the courts\u201d because he thought he could make a case that \u201cthey do not have American citizenship.\u201d (He said he might make an exception if a child had parents who are \u201cvery bad people.\u201d) But as we have noted before, most scholars say a change in birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment.\n\nTrump presented his most coherent and comprehensive proposal for deportations during his Aug. 31, 2016, speech on immigration policy. He said that all 11 million are subject to deportation but that he would prioritize the removal of some of the illegal population. According to The Post\u2019s analysis, Trump would prioritize about half of the roughly 11 million population for swift removal.\n\nTo add up to the 16 million in the tweet and video, the Clinton campaign adds the 4.5 million U.S.-born children of undocumented parents. The children automatically receive citizenship because they were born in the United States. Trump\u2019s concrete plan on the 4.5 million children is unclear. In August 2015, Trump has suggested that he would deport families \u2014 the parents and their children \u2014 if the parents were in the country illegally. He also has called for an end to birthright citizenship.\n\nBut it\u2019s a mystery if this is still Trump\u2019s current stance. He didn\u2019t mention it in his Aug. 31 speech, and his campaign has not clarified, either. So without a clear sense of his stance on the deportation of U.S.-born children of undocumented parents, Clinton\u2019s tweet and video are spinning Trump\u2019s words and stance out of context.
