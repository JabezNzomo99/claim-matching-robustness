Kamala Harris made a few false and misleading claims in two events that kicked off her 2020 presidential campaign.\n\u2022 In a speech in her home state of California on Jan. 27, Harris said \u201cpaychecks aren\u2019t keeping up\u201d with the cost of living. But Bureau of Labor Statistics data show inflation-adjusted weekly earnings have gone up in the past year and since President Donald Trump took office.\n\u2022 She also claimed the administration had given \u201c a trillion dollars to the biggest corporations in this country,\u201d a reference to the 10-year impact of the corporate tax rate reduction in the 2017 tax law. The net tax reduction to businesses, however, was an estimated $653.8 billion.\n\u2022 In a CNN town hall on Jan. 28, Harris said she \u201cdid not oppose\u201d legislation, as the California attorney general, that would have required her office to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate fatal police shootings. In fact, she said such a law was unnecessary.\n\nHarris this week joined a growing number of Democrats who say they will run for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. After making her announcement in California, the senator went to Des Moines, Iowa, the next day for a televised town hall meeting hosted by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\n\nWages Have Gone Up\n\nHarris told the crowd in Oakland that paychecks weren\u2019t keeping pace with the increasing cost of living. But weekly earnings, in inflation-adjusted dollars, have been going up under the Trump administration.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, real (meaning, inflation-adjusted) average weekly earnings for rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers have gone up 2.5 percent since President Donald Trump took office. Those earnings rose 4.7 percent during Barack Obama\u2019s last four years as president.\n\nThe average real weekly earnings of all private-sector workers have increased by 2.4 percent during Trump\u2019s tenure; they went up 3.9 percent in the previous four years.\n\nSo, paychecks, on average, have kept up with rising inflation.\n\nIn January, BLS said that real average hourly earnings for all employees went up 1.1 percent and for production and nonsupervisory employees 1.5 percent for the 12 months ending December 2018. For real average weekly earnings, the increase was 1.2 percent for both groups.\n\nWhen we asked the Harris campaign about the senator\u2019s claim, it pointed to a CBS News article from July, which said, \u201cAverage hourly earnings in June grew just 2.7 percent from the year before \u2014 slower than the rate of inflation.\u201d At the time, BLS said the average hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, were \u201cunchanged\u201d for all workers, though they dropped 0.2 percent for the 12-month-period ending in June for rank-and-file workers.\n\nThe campaign also pointed to a different metric: a look at the buying power of wages in the late 1970s compared with today. In an August report, the Pew Research Center said, \u201cAfter adjusting for inflation, however, today\u2019s average hourly wage has just about the same purchasing power it did in 1978, following a long slide in the 1980s and early 1990s and bumpy, inconsistent growth since then.\u201d\n\nPew also found that the wage gains have disproportionately gone to higher-wage workers.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t support the claim that wages aren\u2019t keeping pace with the cost of living.\n\nHarris also exaggerated the tax savings for corporations under the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in late December 2017.\n\nAccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided a tax reduction over 10 years of a net $653.8 billion for businesses. Harris\u2019 campaign confirmed to us that she was referring only to the law\u2019s reduction of the top corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 21 percent, which JCT estimates will reduce corporate taxes by $1.35 trillion over a decade.\n\nBut other provisions in the law that raised business taxes, such as changes in allowable deductions for net operating losses and interest, caused the net benefit for corporations to be hundreds of billions lower than that.\n\nThe individual income tax changes in the law amounted to an estimated $1.13 trillion tax reduction over 10 years, and overall, including changes to international taxes, the law would reduce taxes by $1.5 trillion over that time period.\n\nHarris\u2019 claim echoes past statements by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who misleadingly said last year that the tax law was \u201ca $1.3 trillion tax break for corporations.\u201d As we\u2019ve said, the net benefit is about half that.\n\nPlus, Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, told us when we wrote about this claim before that the $324 billion the international tax provisions would raise over 10 years would come \u201calmost all from corporations.\u201d Nearly all of that comes from a one-time, reduced rate on foreign profits that U.S. corporations have kept overseas.\n\nIn the CNN town hall on Jan. 28, Tapper asked Harris about \u201ccriticism we\u2019re hearing of you from the left\u201d \u2014 specifically during her time as the state attorney general.\n\nTapper: [T]hey talk about things that you did as attorney general or as prosecutor or as a district attorney in San Francisco. Let me just ask about one of them. Tapper: Which is, when you were attorney general, you opposed legislation that would have required your office to investigate fatal shootings involving police officers. Why did you oppose that bill? Harris: So, I did not oppose the bill. I had a process when I was attorney general of not weighing in on bills and initiatives, because as attorney general, I had a responsibility for writing the title and summary. So I did not weigh in.\n\nThat\u2019s misleading. Harris may not have taken an official position on the bill, but she did oppose the concept of the bill. And her views on the topic were well known.\n\nThe bill \u2014 AB 86, sponsored by Assemblymember Kevin McCarty \u2014 would have required the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate police shootings that involved the death of a civilian. It would have given the special prosecutor the authority to determine whether criminal charges should be filed.\n\nThe Assembly Committee on Public Safety approved the bill in April 2015, but it went no further.\n\nAt the time, Harris did not take an official position on McCarty\u2019s bill. But she had already made clear that \u201cshe does not support the idea of taking prosecutorial discretion away from locally elected district attorneys,\u201d the Capitol Weekly wrote in a May 18, 2015, story.\n\nDuring that interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Harris said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be good public policy to take the discretion from elected district attorneys.\u201d\n\nShe told the Chronicle that the state didn\u2019t need a mechanism for a special prosecutor, because \u201cif I decided that there was a case where there was a local prosecutor who was breaking the law, who was committing prosecutorial misconduct, we would come in and take the case.\u201d\n\nMcCarty, who supported Harris\u2019 successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2016, told the Los Angeles Times in 2016 that he was disappointed that she didn\u2019t support his bill.\n\nAlthough Harris said her office had a policy of not taking a position on legislation, we found at least one example of her taking a position on a bill. In 2015, Harris opposed state legislation that would have imposed statewide standards for the use of body cameras on law enforcement officials \u2014 saying she didn\u2019t want a \u201cone-size-fits-all approach,\u201d and preferred leaving such decisions up to local officials.\n\nWhen we asked about Harris\u2019 response to Tapper, her campaign told us that the senator \u201cmisheard the question.\u201d She thought Tapper was asking about her position on a ballot initiative, and her office does not weigh in on ballot initiatives because it writes the title and summary, her campaign said. We note, however, that Harris immediately responded to Tapper\u2019s question by saying, \u201cI did not oppose the bill.\u201d [Emphasis is ours.] It wasn\u2019t until later in her response that she referenced ballot initiatives.\n\nAs for Harris\u2019 position on the special prosecutor bill, her campaign said: \u201cShe didn\u2019t take a position on the special prosecutor because she personally feels as the [Capitol Weekly] article says, \u2018local district attorneys should have the authority to investigate officer-involved shootings, in part because they are elected by \u2014 and held accountable to \u2014 local constituents.'\u201d\n\nCorrection, Jan. 30: Our original story included a typo.
