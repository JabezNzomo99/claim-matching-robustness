It comes with a few headlines: \u201c\n\nThe claim is that 79-year-old Bill Oxley, a former agent of the US\n\n, made a deathbed confession that he murdered Marley by infecting him with \u201ccancer viruses and bacteria\u201d.\n\nSo far, the story has been checked and rated false by the UK\u2019s\n\n. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the musicians\n\nfrom believing it\u2019s true. Conspiracy theories that the CIA killed Marley have been\n\nBoth Snopes and Channel 4 traced the source of the story to a \u201cdisreputable\u201d and \u201cnotorious fake news\u201d website called\n\n, which published it on 30 November 2017. The\n\n, which has the tagline: \u201cWhere mainstream fears to tread\u201d. But the story is the same.\n\n\u201cThe site is registered by Sean Adl-Tabatabai, a former BBC producer who went on to work for the conspiracy theory website of David Icke, who\n\nthe world is controlled by predatory lizards who demand human sacrifice,\u201d says\n\nsays they could find no record of a Bill or William Oxley \u201chaving any association with the CIA, and neither his name, the quotations attributed to him, nor the basic facts of Your News Wire\u2019s story are corroborated anywhere else\u201d.\n\nof Oxley \u2013 an old white man in a hospital bed \u2013 used in some versions of the story, including the\n\nChannel 4 checked the story in December 2017, a few days after it first appeared online. And they could find no record of Oxley being in the hospital from which the story claimed he made his confession.\n\n\u201cThe article says Bill Oxley is a patient at Mercy Hospital in Maine, America. But he\u2019s not,\u201d says Channel 4.\n\nThey phoned the hospital, but \u201cwe were told there was no one there by that name. Nor were they aware of anyone called Oxley who had been a patient there in recent weeks.\u201d\n\nWhat about the cancer-causing viruses and bacteria?\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to assassinate someone, this would be a really bad way of doing it,\u201d says Channel 4.\n\nIt might be possible to induce cancer in someone by infecting them with a virus known to cause cancer.\n\n\u201cCertain virus and bacteria have been shown to increase your chances of developing types of cancer in the long term, but the research was\n\nat the time of Marley\u2019s death and is not fully understood even now,\u201d says Channel 4.\n\nSnopes adds: \u201cThe precise mechanics of \u201cinfecting\u201d someone with cancer are uncertain, meaning the desired end result, death caused by cancer, would be far from assured.\n\n\u201cAnd while the ultimate cause of death, cancer, would certainly have the benefit of preventing suspicions, it can take years for a person to die from cancer. This would undermine one of the principle purposes of an assassination: to quickly stop an individual doing or saying something.\u201d\n\nAs Channel 4 points out, if the CIA had wanted to murder Marley without raising suspicion, it would have been quicker and easier to use ricin, cyanide or even radiation poisoning.\n\n\u201cBut trying to give him cancer would be far more difficult and far less effective.\u201d \u2013", "lang": "en"}
