The video was published was ETV Bharat (Bihar desk) and Jehanabad Newson YouTube. The description regarding the video given by ETV is as follows: \u201cJehanabad: The body of Tabrez Alam, sharpshooter of former RJD MLA Shahabuddin reached his locality, where namaz was offered. Thousands of people gathered to be a part of the funeral procession of Tabrez.\u201d (translated from Hindi).\n\nTabrez Alam was a sharpshooter from Bihar who was murdered in Patna over a land dispute. If one looks closely at the viral video and the video of the funeral of Tabrez Alam, numerous similarities come to light. The juxtaposed pictures posted below have shown these similarities, which confirms that both videos are of the same event.\n\nThe claim that this video is of the funeral procession of Tabrez Ansari, is false. It may be noted that Tabrez Alam was murdered in Bihar, whereas Tabrez Ansari was lynched by a mob in Jharkhand recently. It may be stated with certainty that the viral video is not of the funeral procession of Tabrez Ansari.", "lang": "en"}
