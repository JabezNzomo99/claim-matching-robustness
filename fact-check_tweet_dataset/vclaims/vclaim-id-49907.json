It is being claimed that the video is from Gandhi Hospital, Hyderabad and the people seen in the video in PPE kit are coronavirus-infected patients.\n\nWhen Vishvas News investigated we found that the claim is false. The people sitting on the hospital\u2019s floor wearing PPE kits were hospital workers and not coronavirus-infected patients.\n\nA video is shared on Facebook by a user named Hyderabad Today with a caption that reads: \u201dHYDERABAD #Governement HOSPITAL..just don\u2019t have words to say anything Ye halat hogaye #COVID19 patients ki. Bas Allah rahem kare.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News investigated the video by performing Google Reverse image search of the keyframes of the video which were extracted from the InVID tool. We found a link to the report published on July 4 on The News Minute website.\n\nAccording to the report, the person sitting on the floor of the hospital wearing PPE was a cleaning staff in the hospital. The report also included the statement of Gandhi Hospital spokesperson. According to the statement, \u201cThe two persons in the video were class IV sanitation staff who were resting after finishing their 12-hour shift.\u201d\n\nThe report further stated, \u201cThey were waiting for their transportation to home and resting at the spot. They are wearing full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, patients only wear masks when moving between two locations within the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe report published on July 5 on the website of the New Indian Express also mentions the incident. According to the report, the employee resting on the floor wearing a PPE kit was a woman.\n\nVishvas News contacted Noor Mohammad, a Hyderabad-based reporter in the news channel Tv9. He told us, \u201cThe viral video is correct, but the claim made with it is false.\u201d The person seen on the floor of the hospital in the video is not a coronavirus-infected patient, but a sanitation worker working for the hospital.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that earlier, a video of another hospital in Hyderabad, Osmania Hospital, went viral with the wrong claim, which was investigated by Vishvas News. The fact check can be read here.\n\nVishvas News scanned the profile of the page that shared the viral post and found that around 300 people follow the page.\n\nConclusion: The video of Gandhi Hospital, Hyderabad is going viral on social media with a false claim. The two persons in the video were class IV sanitation staff who were resting after finishing their 12-hour shift, there weren\u2019t COVID-19 infected patients.", "lang": "en"}
