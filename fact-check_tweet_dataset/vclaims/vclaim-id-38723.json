Click the link below to get the free recharge done. The offer is valid till 31st March.\n\nMany people have shared different links with the same claim.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claims to be false.\n\nThough Jio has taken a few initiatives and started a campaign as to how to fight novel coronavirus, it has nothing to do with this claim.\n\nWe have seen that people are sharing different links to get the recharge done. Like there is one link jionewoffer.online.\n\nAnother link is jiofreerecharges.online. We clicked all the links which directed us to a website where Mukesh Ambani's profile has been used. The site asks for the customer's Jio mobile number and name. People posted this on Twitter as well. One Twitter user tagged Jio on his Twitter handle to get clarification and Jio officially denied the claim on their official Twitter handle.\n\nIn reply, Jio stated, Jio does not send such messages/calls. All Jio offer related information is transparently available in your MyJio app or on http://Jio.com. Pls watch out for spam messages & scammers Kashypi\n\nHence, it can be said the claim that Jio is offering Rs 498 as free recharge till March 31 is false.", "lang": "en"}
