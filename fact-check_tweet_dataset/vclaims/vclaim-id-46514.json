However I realised that not everyone gets jokes and think that this is how he dressed up actually (sic), hence I shared the DNA article on Twitter\" -- Kunal Kamra, Stand-up comedian\n\n\"It was purely to get a laugh from my audience,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile several netizens fell for the image and accused Gambhir of promoting the BJP during a cricket show.\n\nIt was also shared by a fan account of TMC MP Mahua Moitra.\n\nYou can view the archived version of the tweet here.\n\nBOOM checked the Twitter timelines of both Gautam Gambhir and Irfan Pathan to look for the original image. While Pathan had tweeted the photo on June 25, 2019 Gambhir had retweeted it on the same day.\n\nThe photo shows Gambhir was not wearing the headgear and scarf.", "lang": "en"}
