You should watch.\u201d\n\nIt links to a YouTube video (here) in which the narrator states that the Control of Disease Act 1984 was updated on April 27, 2020.\n\nAccording to the narrator, under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, patients suffering from communicable diseases can be \u201cforced to take their medication by supervised administration or involuntary inpatient treatment\u201d.\n\nThe legislation can be found here (here) and it states the opposite. Section 45E reads:\n\n\u201c1. Regulations under section 45B or 45C may not include provision requiring a person to undergo medical treatment.\n\nThe sections referred to \u2013 45B and 45C \u2013 relate to the measures a government can take to prevent the spread of infection or contamination either via international travel or domestically.\n\nIn an online article addressing the claim in the video, barrister Louise Hooper of Garden Court Chambers wrote that she had been unable to find any amendments of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 or Coronavirus Act 2020 made on 27 April 2020. (here).\n\nHooper told Reuters that she could not find any changes made on that date to any other regulations that might have been relevant.\n\nIn the article, she wrote: \u201cThere are multiple human rights and civil liberties implications both globally and domestically arising from the response to COVID-19 and the current crisis. Some of them are very real and concerning. Others are scaremongering and simply not true.\u201d\n\nThe information in the YouTube video was \u201ca misinterpretation or wrong\u201d she said.\n\nNo vaccine has yet been approved against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, though more than 100 candidate vaccines are in development worldwide and a handful have advanced to human trials (here).\n\nTo compel everyone in the UK to be vaccinated would require a change in the law. However, at the British government\u2019s daily press briefing on May 4, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not think a future COVID-19 vaccine would need to be made mandatory.\n\n\u201cI think the extent of the public\u2019s reaction following the lockdown shows we will be able to achieve very, very high levels of vaccination without taking that step,\u201d he said (here).\n\nFalse. No changes to Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 or Coronavirus Act 2020 were made on 27 April 2020. Neither act currently permits making vaccination mandatory.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here.", "lang": "en"}
