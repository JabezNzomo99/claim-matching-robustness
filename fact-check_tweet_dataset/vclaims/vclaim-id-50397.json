No, that's not true: Uncle Silas Robertson is not dead but was the target of a well-known hoax website. A story went viral claiming that the A&E Television star had died - but the truth is he is still \"alive and kickin y'all!\" The website that posted the story is part of a satire network, and this site is dedicated to reporting \"Death Hoaxes for your thoughts and prayers.\"\n\nThe claim appeared in an article published by Conservative Tears on March 10, 2020, and it was titled \"Duck Dynasty's Si Robertson Found Dead\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nShocking news from the Duck Dynasty compound. Silas Robertson, also known as Uncle Si, was found unresponsive in the woods just a few miles south from the DD equipment warehouse. Family spokeswoman Sandy Batts told reporters: \"It is with much sadness to announce that Uncle Si is gone. They finally got him. Those bastards.\" Little is known as to \"who\" she is referring to in the statement.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nAs you read further into the story claiming Uncle Si died, which earned 51,000 shares on Facebook, it escalates quickly from plausible to outlandish - noting that \"Fowl play is suspected\" after describing the odd way the body was found.\n\nRobertson's Facebook page shut down news about his death.\n\nRobertson's About tag on his Facebook page noted that the Louisiana resident is behind the page even if he shuns technology. It reads:\n\nSi Robertson is alive, and with his sense of humor intact.\n\nThe site Conservaite Tears is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact-checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other-fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this, he has rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry very visible disclaimers.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites that often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer, it is, of course, also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes conservativetears.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
