Each set of the circles contains three rings in yellow, black and violet, which appear to move, in a first glance.\n\nThe viral message along with the image reads, \u201cJapanese Psychiatrist Akiyoshi Kitaoka created images designed to help viewers of the images determine their state of mine. Essentially, if you look at these images and they appear to be still (RELAXED), moving slowly (MID-STRESS) and faster moving around (HI-STRESS) and faster moving around (HI-STRESS). Your result???\u201d\n\nBOOM reached out to Professor Kitaoka, who rubbished such a theory attached to his piece of optical illusion art.\n\nBOOM received the message on its WhatsApp helpline number (77009606111).\n\nThe same message is also viral on facebook.\n\nThe facebook post is archived here.\n\nBOOM contacted professor Akiyoshi Kitaoka, who created the art, titled, Rotating snakes...Circular snakes appear to rotate spontaneously. Kitaoka dismissed the association of stress measurement with his works of art.\n\nKitaoka teaches Psychology at the Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto, Japan and he confirmed to BOOM that stress cannot be measured while watching visual graphics.\n\nKitaoka further said that these graphic works of art have been created on CorelDraw, a graphic design software.\n\nMore of Kitaoka's illusion images can be viewed on his profile in the Ritsumeikan University\u2019s website here.\n\nIn fact, Kitaoka also issued a clarification on his profile, after BOOM contacted him on September 18. \"Visual illusion has nothing to do with stress,\" has been stated on his artwork in the website.", "lang": "en"}
