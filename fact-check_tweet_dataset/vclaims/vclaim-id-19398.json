Swami tweeted the video claiming that average Kashmiris are celebrating the dilution of Article 370. Her tweet read, \u201c#KashmirWelcomesChange The children in Kashmir singing \u2018Hindustan Hamara hai\u2019 While the seculars are sulking the abrogation of Article 370, an average Kashmiri is celebrating the integration with Mighty India! #ThursdayThoughts#ThursdayMotivation.\u201c\n\nThe clip has also been circulated on Facebook with the same caption.\n\nThe video shared by Swami carried a logo that said \u2013 \u2018Voice of J&K\u2019. Alt News found a Facebook page by the same name that had shared the identical clip on April 15, 2019. Since the video is four months old, it cannot be representative of an event that took place after the government\u2019s decision to deem Article 370 ineffective on August 5.\n\nA keyword search on YouTube led us to the same video uploaded by BJP Jammu and Kashmir on April 15 described as \u2013 \u201cKids Chanting Song Yeah Hindustan Hamara Hai at Challar, Inderwal in Kishtwar during BJP rally.\u201d\n\nThe video does not represent children in Kashmir celebrating the government\u2019s move on Article 370 but an old BJP rally. This was earlier debunked by Boomlive.\n\nAfter the dilution of Article 370, Alt News has debunked several such cases of misinformation.", "lang": "en"}
