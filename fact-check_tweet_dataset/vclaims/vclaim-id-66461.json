A transgender man, for example, refers to a transgender individual who currently identifies as a man.\n\n, according to the center, is an \"older term for people whose gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth who seeks to transition from male to female or female to male. Many do not prefer this term because it is thought to sound overly clinical.\"\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau and the for Disease Control and Prevention do not attempt to count the number of Americans who identify themselves as transgender.\n\nmade in 2011, by an in LGBT demography at UCLA Law School, put the figure at nearly 700,000, or 0.3 percent of the population.\n\nWe\u2019ll start our analysis by noting that we have a claim by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison. He said Wisconsin, in 1982, became the first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nThat article noted that the law leaves out transgender people.\n\nThe District of Columbia and 18 states -- including Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa -- have laws that \"clearly prohibit discrimination against transgender people,\" to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nBy comparison, produced by the National Center for Transgender Equality says Wisconsin is among states with laws that protect against discrimination based on sex (gender) or on sexual orientation but don\u2019t have clear protections for gender identity.\n\n, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin; , president and general counsel of the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative, libertarian public interest law firm; Marquette University law professor , who directs the law school\u2019s labor and employment law program; and attorney , who heads the civil rights and liberties section of the State Bar of Wisconsin.\n\nHere was the consensus:\n\n1. Wisconsin statutes that prohibit discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation in three areas -- employment, housing and public accommodation -- do not expressly include transgender people.\n\n2. That means that -- unlike gay men, for example, who have a right to file a complaint alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation -- it\u2019s unknown whether a Wisconsin state court would accept complaints from transgender people alleging discrimination based on their transgender status.\n\n3. Instead, a transgender person would have to persuade a judge that transgender people are covered either by state laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex or on sexual orientation.\n\n4. To date, there has not been a published decision by a state judge in Wisconsin stating that transgender people are covered by those anti-discrimination laws.\n\nRae said Wisconsin's non-discrimination law \"doesn't protect members of the transgender community.\"\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether a transgender person could pursue in state court a discrimination case using laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex (gender) or on sexual orientation. What is clear is Wisconsin laws do not expressly prohibit discrimination based on a person\u2019s status as transgender.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "lang": "en"}
