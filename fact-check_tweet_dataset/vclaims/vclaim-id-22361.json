Her campaign gained momentum from an interview she gave on an internet show that is supported, in part, by a nonprofit that received a grant from an organization that received funding from a Soros foundation.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez has gotten a lot of attention since she upset the Democratic Party\u2019s primary in New York\u2019s 14th congressional district in June.\n\nSeveral websites have recently been circulating stories with headlines that claim: \u201cDetails of Democrat Communist Antisemite Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Ties To George SOROS Revealed\u201d and \u201cDetails Of Communist Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Ties To George Soros Revealed.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s less here than meets the eye.\n\nThe stories point to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s appearance on The Young Turks, a liberal internet show, as evidence that she is tied to the liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros.\n\nOcasio-Cortez did appear on The Young Turks, which is supported in part by a nonprofit that has received a grant from a group that gets some of its funding from a Soros foundation. In fact, she credited the online show with giving her campaign exposure. But her campaign has not received any funding from Soros.\n\nThe Young Turks is supported by The Media Consortium, which describes itself as a \u201cnetwork of independent and community media outlets dedicated to values-driven journalism.\u201d In 2017, the most recent year for which information is available, The Media Consortium got funding from the Chicago Community Trust, the Park Foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, and the Media Democracy Fund. The Media Democracy Fund lists 12 funding partners and one of them is Soros\u2019 the Open Society Foundations.\n\nBut, the stories call The Media Consortium \u201ca Soros media empire\u201d and cite an organization called the Media Research Center as the authority for that claim. But, just as The Young Turks and The Media Consortium described themselves as progressive, the Media Research Center identifies as conservative. It says its mission is \u201cto expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left: the national news media\u201d and touts its efforts to spread \u201cconservative content.\u201d\n\nAlso, Ocasio-Cortez isn\u2019t a communist, she\u2019s a Democratic Socialist who will appear on the Democratic Party\u2019s line in the November election.\n\nUpdated, Sept. 4: We removed a reference to the origin of the show\u2019s name, The Young Turks.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
