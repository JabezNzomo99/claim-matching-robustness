It has been viewed over 881,000 times and has been shared by more than 51,000 people.\n\nShe can be visibly seen wearing a DOH vest and ID lanyard.\n\nTanduay Distillers, Inc., which manufactures the alcohol used in the fallacious clip, issued March 23 a statement via its official FB page saying the concoction \u201cWILL NOT produce a viable disinfectant\u201d against COVID-19 and may cause serious harm.\n\nSimilarly, Green Cross Inc., maker of the Zonrox bleach and a distributor of isopropyl alcohol issued an advisory on March 25 in FB telling the public to \u201cnot follow or believe the video.\u201d\n\nThe untrue FB video continues to circulate on social media as the country combats the COVID-19 pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
