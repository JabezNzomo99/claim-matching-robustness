Hence, it is unclear why Pooja chose to respond to Shoaib who was not servicing her complaint after his initial response at 12:09 pm.\n\nWithin Airtel, the storm after this incident has also forced the organisation to relook at its own response time when a communally sensitive demand is made by one of its customers on a public platform. The company was heavily criticised for taking over 5 hours to tweet an appropriate response calling out Pooja for her bigoted tweet.\n\nWe have not been able to reach out to Pooja Singh for her version of the conversation with Airtel.\n\nBOOM sent Airtel a formal email seeking detailed replies to several queries on their internal processes and the missing tweet of Gaganjot. We are yet to receive a reply from the company and will update the story if we receive it later.", "lang": "en"}
