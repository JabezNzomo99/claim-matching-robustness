It was expected from foolish Modi. Only a lowlife can make a child make sit on his lap and make her utter foul language in a well rehearsed manner. -translated\u201d, was the caption affixed to the video.\n\nIn the 23-second clip, the little girl accompanying Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a podium can be heard saying, \u201cRahul Gandhi pappu hai\u201d. This post has garnered close to 6,200 shares so far. Primarily, the video seems to have been dubbed with some other audio clip and was passed off as satire.\n\nHowever many social media users fell for the video posted by the Facebook page, believing it to be true.\n\nOn Twitter, a user @erbmjha had tweeted the same clip on November 3, 2018 with an indication of the satire.\n\nAnother version of the dubbed video was tweeted in response to the aforementioned tweet.\n\nAlt News found the original video posted by the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s official YouTube channel on September 18, 2016. As suggested in the caption, \u201cA specially-abled girl reads extract from Ramayana\u201d. At 0:20, the girl starts off by introducing herself after which PM Modi asks her to recite the Ramayana.\n\nAlthough the video was passed off in a satirical manner, it ended up being mischievously shared by a Facebook page claiming it to be true. In the past as well, Alt News had found how several users on social media believed that a child said \u201cModi\u201d in answer to Trump\u2019s question, \u201cwho do you like the most?\u201d", "lang": "en"}
