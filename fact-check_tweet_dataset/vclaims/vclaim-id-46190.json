The question came up at his daily briefing on Election Day.\n\n\"Well, there you have to ask the people that,\" Trump said. \"You have a Democrat in Wisconsin as governor. Ask him. That's his problem. Okay? He should be doing it. Again, some governors fail, and I won't let them fail, because when they fail, I'll help. But that's run by Democrats right now. Okay? It's run by Democrats.\"\n\nSo Trump deflects a question about social distancing in Wisconsin by saying the state is \"run by Democrats.\"\n\nLet\u2019s take a minute to review who\u2019s in charge here.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with this: Wisconsin hasn\u2019t been run by Democrats since 2010. That\u2019s the last time Democrats held the governor\u2019s office and both houses of the Legislature.\n\nRepublicans established their own trifecta in 2011, and maintained it until 2019, when Democratic Gov. Tony Evers was sworn in after defeating Republican incumbent Scott Walker.\n\nSince then, Wisconsin government has been defined by this split power, with Evers and the Legislature warring over matters big and small.\n\nThe lack of unity was on full display leading up to the election, as Evers first pushed for a mail-in election with a May deadline, then tried to move the election back to June through an executive order. Republican leaders adjourned a special session on the mail-in option within seconds, then went to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to oppose the executive order \u2014 where the high court ruled in Republicans\u2019 favor.\n\nWe\u2019ll note that court is currently a 5-2 conservative majority.\n\nSo to recap the three branches:\n\nYes, Wisconsin\u2019s highest office is held by a Democrat.\n\nBut the Legislature is strongly Republican \u2014 a 19-14 majority in the Senate and a 63-36 majority in the Assembly.\n\nAnd the state Supreme Court has a strong conservative bent as well, though it could move a notch pending the outcome of the race between Justice Daniel Kelly, who was backed by Republicans, and challenger Jill Karofsky, who was backed by Democrats.\n\nAsked whether Wisconsin is properly observing national social distancing guidelines in light of the election, Trump said to ask the Democrats who \"run\" Wisconsin.\n\nTrump is right that a Democrat, Evers, holds the state\u2019s highest office. But Republicans control the other two branches.\n\nAnd the pre-election battles illustrated exactly how divided Wisconsin is, as Republicans thwarted two different attempts to alter or delay in-person voting. That makes Trump\u2019s central point \u2014 that Democrats are to blame for any social distancing violations \u2014 all the more off base.\n\nSo we are left with a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That\u2019s our definition of Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
