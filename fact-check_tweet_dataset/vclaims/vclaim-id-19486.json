Mathai\u2019s (Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s Special Assistant between 1946 and 1959) autobiography. Let\u2019s try to check whether Mathai made the statements given in the post.\n\n\n\nWhen searched about the autobiography of Mathai on Google, it was found that he wrote two books: one is \u2018Reminiscences of the Nehru Age\u2019 (published in 1978) and the other is \u2018My Days with Nehru\u2019 (published in 1979). The archived text versions of the books can be read here and here. Let us check whether the claims made in the post are taken from these books. The claims in the posts can be broadly grouped into three categories:\n\nIn the post, it was mentioned that Nehru\u2019s actual parents are Mubarak Ali and Thussu Rahman Bai. But when looked for those names in the books written by Mathai, no such names were found. Mathai did not write anything about them in his books. On the Indian National Congress website, it can be found that Jawaharlal Nehru was born to Motilal and Swarup Rani Thussu in 1889. Also, in the autobiography of Nehru (Toward Freedom) (archived text version of the book can be read here), the parents\u2019 names were given as \u2018Pandit Motilal Nehru\u2019 and \u2018Swarup Rani Nehru\u2019.\n\nMathai also did not write anything about Nehru\u2019s forefathers being followers of Islam. In the post, it is written that Motilal\u2019s father\u2019s original name was Ghiyasuddin and he later changed his name to Gangadhar Nehru. But, it can be read in Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s autobiography that it was his ancestor Raj Kaul who got the name \u2018Nehru\u2019 (from nahar, a canal) added to his family line, not his grandfather. It should be noted that Raj Kaul was also not Muslim and Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s grandparents also had \u2018Pandit\u2019 and \u2018Nehru\u2019 in their names. Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s grandfather name was \u2018Pandit Ganga Dhar Nehru\u2019.\n\nIn the post, it is written that Nehru\u2019s family migrated to Kashmir after 1857. Mathai did not write anything on this migration. In Nehru\u2019s autobiography, it can be read that his family migrated to Agra, not Kashmir, after the revolt of 1857.\n\nIn Chapter 17 of \u2018Reminiscences of the Nehru Age\u2019 book, Mathai describes Feroze Gandhi as \u2018son of a Parsi liquor and provision merchant of Allahabad\u2019. Nowhere else in his books he describes Feroze Gandhi as a Muslim. Mathai, also, did not write anything about the Muslim names of Indira Gandhi\u2019s children.\n\n3. Mohd. Ali Jinnah and Sheikh Abdullah are sons of Motilal Nehru:\n\nIn the post, it is claimed that Mohd. Ali Jinnah is born to Motilal\u2019s 4th wife and Sheikh Abdullah is born to Motilal\u2019s 5th wife. None of the claims was mentioned in Mathai\u2019s books. If you look at the date-of-births of Motilal and Jinnah, it can be found that Motilal was just 15 years in 1876 (when Jinnah born) but the post claims that Jinnah was born to Motilal\u2019s 4th wife. This itself sounds absurd. When looked for the details of Jinnah\u2019s father, it can be found on the Pakistan Government\u2019s official website that Jinnah\u2019s father is Jinnahbhai Poonja. So, these claims are also not true.\n\nWhile it is true that Mathai had made some controversial statements in his books, none of the claims in the post can be found in his books. Also, none of the reviews of the book mention the claims made in the post (reviews on the books can be read here and here).\n\nTo sum it up, M. O. Mathai made no such comments on Nehru family in his books.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
