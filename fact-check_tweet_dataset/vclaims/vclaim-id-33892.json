The placard read, \u201cI am Swati.\u201d Singh wrote, \u201cOn Odd Day. Swati a Hindu. Even Day. Sabiha Khan Muslim\u201d and claimed that both the women are the same person.\n\nAnother user @Being_Vinita who was recently featured on an Alt News fact-check for passing off old images as violence during anti-CAA protests also claimed the same She posted another image of Swati with a placard during a protest against Tabrez Ansari\u2019s lynching. The placard reads, \u201cI am a Hindu and I love Muslims\u2026You killed our Tabrez, we are all Tabrez.\u201d\n\nFACT-CHECK: NOT THE SAME WOMAN\n\nAlt News fact-checked this claim when Swati\u2019s images were viral after a protest against Tabrez Ansari\u2019s lynching. She is a Delhi-based student who had shared her driving licence with Alt News to confirm her identity. Alt News is withholding her full name at her request.\n\nThe woman wearing a hijab is Sabiha Khan, former leader of the Hyderabad-based political party, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM). Khan has a dedicated Facebook page with a significant following of over 2 lakh.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Khan\u2019s name is also written on the viral image.\n\nThe facial features of Swati and Sabiha Khan are markedly different.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Khan had posted Swati\u2019s image with the placard condemning Ansari\u2019s lynching which might have led to the earlier confusion of them being the same woman.\n\nAlt News contacted Khan who said that she is a resident of Mumbai and as far as her knowledge, Swati is a Delhi-based student. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they are misusing my picture. This is completely fake,\u201d she said.\n\nThus, a Muslim woman\u2019s image was passed off on social media as a protester who masqueraded as a Hindu woman during anti-CAA protest.", "lang": "en"}
