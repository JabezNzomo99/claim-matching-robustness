And hours later, at his Montana rally Oct. 18, Trump floated his own conspiracy theory: that this was all a big ruse financed by his political opponents. The caravan \u201cdidn\u2019t just happen,\u201d and \u201ca lot of money has been passing through to people to come up and try to get to the border by Election Day because [Democrats] think that\u2019s a negative for us,\u201d Trump told the crowd.\n\nWhat the video does show: dozens of people separated by gender are standing in loose lines along a roadside. Many of them are carrying bags or backpacks. Two men in white T-shirts and jeans make their way down the lines handing out what appears to be cash (red-and-white rectangular bills). One of the men is seen carrying a handgun in his waistband. The other is wearing a baseball cap that says \u201cFox,\u201d the logo for a clothing company.\n\nThrough a little digital detective work, we found that the video was shot when the caravan was passing through Chiquimula, Guatemala \u2014 near the border with Honduras but not in Honduras, as Gaetz said. (After we sent an email to Gaetz\u2019s office pointing this out, along with several questions, Gaetz tweeted a correction. He and his staff did not respond to our questions.)\n\nU.S. and Latin American journalists and humanitarian and nonprofit organization workers on the ground consistently report that these caravans are rare and mostly self-organized, by residents with real concerns about safety and poverty in Central America. The messaging app WhatsApp is a hub of activity for these caravan members. They travel in large groups to ensure a safe journey. Yet there are several wide-eyed theories flying around about who\u2019s leading these particular migrants and who might be behind the men with the money. Let\u2019s break them down:\n\u2022 None George Soros or U.S.-backed NGOs. Soros, a Hungarian American businessman who is Jewish, is often cast as the boogeyman in right-wing conspiracy theories. But usually his critics make a bare effort to scare up at least some trace of evidence to support their case. Gaetz didn\u2019t even try. Anyway, the Open Society Foundations, which is funded by Soros, Soros, a Hungarian American businessman who is Jewish, is often cast as the boogeyman in right-wing conspiracy theories. But usually his critics make a bare effort to scare up at least some trace of evidence to support their case. Gaetz didn\u2019t even try. Anyway, the Open Society Foundations, which is funded by Soros, was quick to say that neither it nor Soros was \u201cfunding this effort.\u201d Regional experts say that U.S.-backed NGOs have worked to increase public safety and economic stability, mitigating the insecurity that often contributes to why people flee in the first place. We couldn\u2019t find any evidence that an NGO was behind this effort to hand out cash in Guatemala.\n\u2022 None Democrats. Trump at his rally hinted that Democrats might be behind this caravan. There\u2019s no evidence to support this theory. In Trump at his rally hinted that Democrats might be behind this caravan. There\u2019s no evidence to support this theory. In a video message in Spanish , the acting U.S. ambassador to Honduras said to migrants: \u201cPlease, go back to your country. You are being deceived with false promises from political and criminal leaders.\u201d That\u2019s a vague statement, but it doesn\u2019t make reference to any fanciful theories about Soros, Democrats or NGOs. Instead, the statement suggests that internal Honduran politics is behind the exodus. The White House did not respond to our questions.\n\u2022 None The Honduran opposition party. TheUpdate: On Oct. 23, Vice President Mike Pence echoed the Honduran president\u2019s claim, but provided no evidence to support it. He told the Washington Post in an interview, \u201cWhat the president of Honduras told me [is that the caravan] was organized by leftist groups in Honduras, financed by Venezuela and sent north to challenge our sovereignty and challenge our border.\u201d The Daily Beast reported this theory spun from a report by HCH, Honduras\u2019s most-watched news channel. In the report, a woman who claimed to be a migrant claimed Bartolo Fuentes, a former Honduran lawmaker from the opposition, was the organizer. She told the network Fuentes promised to pay for the migrants food and transportation, something Fuentes strongly refutes. He told the Daily Beast, \u201cIn Honduras, the government wants to minimize why people are leaving\u2014they know they are going to leave and they want to say they are doing so because of lies and the opposition, not the conditions that they created. This is in line with what the United States is saying\u2014that there are false promises being made. And this pro-government news program played into that messaging, trying to say that there is financing when really people just need to get out.\u201d The Honduran government says that an opposition party, Partido Libertad y Refundaci\u00f3n, organized the caravan as part of a political ploy. A leader of the Honduran opposition party, former president Manuel Zelaya, who was deposed in a coup in 2009, released a statement saying the party was not involved. Out-migration, security and poverty are some of the most contested political issues in Honduras.\n\u2022 None Chiquimula residents. Reports from journalists and nonprofits following the caravan have noted that Guatemalan locals have been providing water bottles, spare cash and other supplies to support migrants on the long journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. A photographer from Agence France-Presse in Guatemala confirmed this, saying locals often provide money, food and clothes to migrants, though he could not say that\u2019s what was happening in this video shared by Gaetz and Trump. But that doesn\u2019t really explain the presence of an armed man or the organized effort to distribute cash. Annie Bird, director of the Guatemala Human Rights Commission, said it\u2019s not unusual for people to carry arms in Chiquimula, unlike in other parts of the country. It\u2019s a mix of safety concerns and local culture, she said. Other experts confirmed Bird\u2019s assessment, noting that because Chiquimula is along a migratory route, many of which are controlled by narcos, it\u2019s typical to see an increase in security.\n\u2022 None UPDATE: The cartels. Gaetz told the New York Times he, \u201cnow suspects that the men handing out money were cartel members trying to sow good will and subvert the government.\u201d Given the location and the presence of armed personnel, initially, this seemed likely. However, experts noted cartels work in consort with the coyotes who profit by smuggling people to the U.S. border. In other words, it would work against their interest to support the caravan.\n\nMultiple reports from nongovernmental organizations active on the ground have said that the movement was organized and grew organically. That\u2019s not hard to believe. There are plenty of reasons to emigrate from Honduras. There is the massive and rising poverty level. The worsening security situation, as gangs extort and destroy small businesses. And all of that before noting that more than 10 people are killed a day, on average. Plus, moving in a large group provides protection for individuals, saving the expense of a coyote to shepherd them through the journey north.\n\nWhile we haven\u2019t been able to pin down exactly who was distributing cash in Guatemala, there is no evidence to back up claims that Soros, U.S.-backed NGOs or the Democrats are secretly organizing this caravan. As always at The Fact Checker, the burden of proof is on the speaker. This seems to be a cherry-picked video reused as a political scare tactic. For their willingness to promote propaganda, Trump and Gaetz earn Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
