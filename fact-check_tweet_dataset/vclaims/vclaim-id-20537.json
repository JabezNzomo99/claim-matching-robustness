The first is the cost of scrapping the tuition fees (and associated loans) of future students\u2014this is the policy in Labour\u2019s manifesto. The second is the possibility of wiping off the amounts owed by current graduates\u2014which Labour has separately said it would like to try to do.\n\nIt was the latter that Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s Shadow Education Secretary, was talking about when she referred to a \u00a3100 billion cost. When asked on Sunday\u2019s BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show how much wiping out current student debt would cost, Angela Rayner said \u201cit\u2019s \u00a3100 billion which they estimate currently, which will increase\u201d.\n\nThe Student Loans Company has put the outstanding balance due from student loans in England at \u00a389.3 billion (which includes English students studying in the UK, and EU students studying in England). This isn\u2019t just about tuition fee loans\u2014it also includes the cost of maintenance loans. It goes up to \u00a3100.5 billion UK wide.\n\nBut there are a few reasons to think the cost would not be as high as this\u2014at least when talking about the current amount of student debt (the total amount of debt is increasing each year as more students go to university).\n\nThe government already writes off some student loan debt\n\nFirst, as Ms Rayner said on the programme, the government already \u2018writes off\u2019 a certain amount of this anyway due to the way the system is designed.\n\nGraduates only start to repay their debts when they reach a certain income threshold (currently \u00a321,000 for students taking out a loan since 2012) and have their debts written off if they\u2019re not repaid after 30 years (or after 25 years for students who started courses between 2006 and 2012).\n\nSo a certain amount is always expected not to be paid back.\n\nThe cost would depend on which loans were written off\n\nSecond, this \u00a389 billion includes the cost of maintenance loans and tuition fee loans before the higher \u00a39,000 fees came in back in 2012. When discussing the idea, Jeremy Corbyn was talking about alleviating those \u201cthat had the historical misfortune to be at university during the \u00a39,000 period\u201d. Some have interpreted this to mean the policy would focus on these graduates.\n\nSo if the focus is on wiping off only tuition fee debts for students studying in the \u00a39,000 period, the cost would be lower. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated the outstanding stock of loans for these graduates is roughly \u00a330 billion (but this still excludes the amount of these that are already expected not to be repaid).\n\nThese costs are separate to the costs of removing future tuition fees, which the IFS has looked into here.", "lang": "en"}
