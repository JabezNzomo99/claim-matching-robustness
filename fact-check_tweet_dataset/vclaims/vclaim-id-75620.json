Next year\u2019s observance will be the 52nd edition. The pope\u2019s message will be released on January 24, feast of St Francis de Sales, the patron of journalists.\n\nIn 2016, one of the biggest fake news stories globally was the pope's supposed endorsement of Donald Trump in the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections.\n\nIn July 2016, fake news website WTOE 5 News reported that the pope had broken with tradition and unequivocally endorsed Donald Trump for president.\n\nThe story was debunked by fact checking organisations such as FactCheck.Org - Did the Pope Endorse Trump? and Snopes - 'Nope Francis.
