The claim is false; the footage has circulated online since 2011 in relation to reports about a lake in Argentina which was covered in ash after a volcanic eruption in neighbouring Chile; AFP photographers captured corresponding photos of the ash-covered lake in June 2011.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than seven million times after being published in this Facebook post on May 3, 2019. It has been shared more than 150,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe clip, which is one minute, 24 seconds long, shows a person in an orange diving suit wading through water covered in a layer of ash.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cLocation : South of Saudi Arabian border ....This is not water ... This is Sand ...Yes sand . It\u2019s called Allen Alkhai desert.\u201d\n\nKeyword searches on Google found no place called the \u201cAllen Alkhai desert\u201d in or near Saudi Arabia. However there is a large desert region south of the Saudi border called \u201cRub al Khali\u201d; here is an encyclopaedia entry.\n\nThe same video was also shared on Facebook here with a similar claim. It was also shared on Twitter here and on YouTube here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the footage has circulated online since 2011 in relation to reports about a lake in Argentina which was covered in ash from a volcanic eruption in neighbouring Chile.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found this identical video published on YouTube on June 13, 2011.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nThe video\u2019s Spanish-language caption translates to English as: \u201cDiver trying to swim in Lake Nahuel Huapi, which is covered by a thick layer of volcanic ash emitted by Puyehue volcano.\u201d\n\nAt the one minute four seconds mark, a person can be heard saying in Spanish: \"Metido como dos metros dentro del agua\", which translates to English as: \"Something is like two metres in the water\".\n\nLake Nahuel Huapi is located in southwest Argentina, near the border with Chile.\n\nPuyehue volcano erupted in Chile in June 2011; here is an AFP report from the time.\n\nMultiple media reports from June 2011 \u2013 for example here in The Atlantic and here in The Telegraph \u2013 say that ash from Puyehue\u2019s eruption travelled to Argentina, covering places including Lake Nahuel Huapi.\n\nAFP also published photos from Lake Nahuel Huapi covered in volcanic ash from the eruption. Below is a screenshot of this shot taken by AFP photographer Francisco Ramos Mejia:\n\nThe caption states: \u201cPeople on the shore of Lake Nahuel Huapi's Machete branch, touch the ashes from Chile's Puyehue volcano which practically cover its surface, near Villa La Angostura, in the Argentine province of Neuquen, taken on June 19, 2011.\u201d\n\n\u201cThousands of evacuated Chileans were allowed to return home Sunday two weeks after the eruption of the Puyehue volcano, which sent a huge ash cloud into the sky and disrupted air travel in the southern hemisphere.\u201d\n\nOther high quality footage of the lake covered in ash after the volcano eruption was published on YouTube here on June 16, 2011.\n\nThe video is embedded below:", "lang": "en"}
