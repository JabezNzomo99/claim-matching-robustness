Adam Schiff with the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The original photo shows Schiff with his father.\n\nA viral photo shared on Facebook has been manipulated to show Rep. Adam Schiff sitting on a couch alongside the financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSome sharing the photo deemed it evidence that the two were apparently \u201cbuddies.\u201d\n\nBut the original photo actually showed Schiff, a Democrat from California, with his father, Ed Schiff, during Thanksgiving last year. Schiff posted the picture in November 2018 on Twitter; he previously shared a photo of his father on Facebook.\n\nThe altered photo swaps the elder Schiff\u2019s face with that of Epstein, and includes a sex toy that was not in the original image.\n\nEpstein, a financier with connections to high-profile politicians, died in what officials ruled a suicide in a federal prison in Manhattan; he was being held on charges of sex trafficking of minors.\n\nSchiff, who chairs the House intelligence committee, recently has gained national attention for his role overseeing part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously debunked other claims involving Epstein, including a widely circulated \u2014 and bogus \u2014 image that was edited to show Epstein with Trump and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
