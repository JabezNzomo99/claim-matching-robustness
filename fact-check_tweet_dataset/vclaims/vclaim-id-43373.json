Now, a March 21 Facebook post is claiming hot water with lemon slices can \u201ckill the proliferation of the virus in our bodies.\u201d\n\nHowever, as with other bogus remedies circulating online, no proof could be found to support the post\u2019s claim. The World Health Organization (WHO) notes on its website that while some home remedies may alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, there is no evidence they can prevent or cure the disease caused by the new virus.\n\nIn fact, a spokesman for the WHO told The Indian Express that there \u201cis no scientific evidence that lemon/turmeric prevents COVID-19.\u201d (RELATED: Can Colloidal Silver \u2018Kill\u2019 Coronavirus?)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence \u2013 and it\u2019s even contrary to medical science \u2013 that attempting to alkalinize your body through lemon juice or other means does anything for coronavirus,\u201d reads a WebMD post about the topic. \u201cAnd biologically speaking, it\u2019s simply nonsense.\u201d\n\nVariations of the claim about hot lemon water have been previously debunked by other fact-checking websites, including PolitiFact, Snopes and AFP Fact Check.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
