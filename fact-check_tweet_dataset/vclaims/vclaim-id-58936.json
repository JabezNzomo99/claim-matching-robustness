But it is false; Wayfair denied the allegations, saying the product names were determined by an algorithm, and various children tied to the claim were not in fact missing at the time it emerged.\n\n\u201cIs it possible Wayfair involved in Human trafficking with their WFX Utility collection? Or are these just extremely overpriced cabinets?\u201d asked Reddit user PrincessPeach1987 on the discussion website\u2019s section dedicated to conspiracy theories, r/conspiracy, on July 9, 2020.\n\n\u201cNote the names of the cabinets,\u201d the user added in the post, which features a screenshot of the online retailer\u2019s website showing four storage cabinets priced between $12,699 and $14,499. The cupboards are named Neriah, Yaritza, Samiyah and Alyvia.\n\nDespite the absence of any evidence, social media users quickly appropriated and added to the conspiracy theory, claiming on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok that specific children were being sold online under the guise of overpriced household items.\n\nHowever, the claim is nothing more than a hoax.\n\n\u201cThere is, of course, no truth to these claims,\u201d Jane Carpenter, a Wayfair spokeswoman, told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cThe products in question are industrial grade cabinets that are accurately priced,\u201d she explained, adding that they have been temporarily removed from the site to rename them and clarify the reason for the high pricing.\n\nCarpenter told AFP that an algorithm names the products available on the website.\n\n\u201cThat algorithm uses first names, geographic locations, and common words for naming purposes, which is why some of the products in question are named with human first names,\u201d she said, adding that the practice is common in retail.\n\nAfter the claim was posted on Reddit, other social media users tied various products available on Wayfair to the names of children who have allegedly disappeared in the US. But many of them are not currently missing.\n\nSamiyah Mumin, a 17-year-old from Columbus, Ohio who was falsely reported missing in May 2019, saw her name tied to the claim.\n\nShe debunked the claim herself in a long Facebook live video on July 10, 2020, complaining about the unwanted attention to which she had been subjected.\n\nColumbus police also told AFP by email that, \u201cWe were unable to find any missing reports on her.\u201d\n\nTori Dunning, whose last name is the same as a pillow sold on Wayfair, was also said to have been one of the trafficked children, but she too is not currently missing.\n\n\u201cThat girl is now 24 years old. It\u2019s an old post that someone is circulating and she is aware of it. She is perfectly fine,\u201d Doss said, adding that Dunning did run away as a teenager, and the old missing status is circulating again.\n\nSamara Duplessis, a Michigan teenager reported missing on May 7, also had her name used to support the conspiracy theory. However, she had been found before it emerged, her mother announced in a Facebook post on May 10.\n\nOthers mentioned in the claims include Maryland\u2019s Cameron James Dziedzic, reported missing on March 10. He was later found, the Calvert County Sheriff\u2019s office reported on April 2.\n\nThe conspiracy theory also included a Texas child missing and later found in 2017.\n\nSeveral children were reported missing but have not yet been found, local police told AFP. These included Connecticut\u2019s Yaritza Castro, and Anabel Wilson from Kansas.\n\nOfficer Thomas Tomasic of the Kansas City, Kansas, Police Department told AFP by phone that Wilson was a \u201crunaway.\u201d\n\nTomasic said Wilson had been found on July 9, 2020 but escaped as she was being taken to a shelter, and is now missing again.", "lang": "en"}
