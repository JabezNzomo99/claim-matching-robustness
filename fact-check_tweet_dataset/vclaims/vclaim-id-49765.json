Don't believe it.", "author": "verafiles.org", "date": "Jun 13, 2020, 1:27 AM", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-49765", "url": "https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-netizens-revive-false-inday-sara-state", "vclaim": "At least six Facebook (FB) accounts recycled a three-month-old post claiming Davao City mayor and presidential daughter Sara Duterte told Filipinos to blame local government units (LGUs)\u2014not her father, President Rodrigo Duterte\u2014for the P200-billion COVID-19 assistance they have not received. Her \u201cstatement\u201d also included lines in support of federalism.\n\nA search through Mayor Duterte\u2019s personal social media accounts and that of her office showed no records of her making the pronouncement. It was neither reported by the media, nor quoted in official records.\n\nLooking up the untrue post's copies via social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle reveals that its earliest publicly available version was uploaded in the evening of April 1.\n\nIt was not attributed to Duterte. Another early iteration of the post can be found here.\n\nIt was only on April 2 when netizens started crediting the statement to the presidential daughter. Its earliest traceable version was published in public group POLOMOLOK 2030.\n\nThe mayor herself has disowned the statement last April 3. In a post on the City Government of Davao\u2019s official FB page, Duterte said the article \u201cis not [hers] nor does it reflect [her] actual views about federalism and how the national government is responding to the COVID-19 health crisis.\u201d\n\nShe also told the authors and sharers of the article\u2014who she pointed out were \u201csupporters\u201d of both her father and federalism\u2014to \u201cbe ashamed of themselves\u201d for duping the public with \u201cfake information apparently manufactured to peddle an agenda.\u201d\n\nThe P200 billion mentioned in the erroneous posts refers to the cash allotment released by the government in late March to help 18 million low-income families affected by the pandemic, as stated in the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.\n\nThe wrongly-attributed version of the post was most recently re-published on July 5, four days after reports surfaced about a P23.5-billion loan secured by the Philippines from Japan, which is to be added to the country\u2019s budget for measures in response to the pandemic.\n\nThe recent revivals of the incorrectly attributed statement were made by FB pages Kitty Duterte, FACP, Duterte - Duterte Tandem 2022, Matang Aguila Publication News Online, Unite Pinas, Para sa Bayan, and a netizen in public group OPINYONG TUNAY.\n\nMeanwhile, a similar post by page President Duterte Supporters - Cebu Chapter was also recently reshared by some netizens on FB. It was first published three months ago.\n\nAll eight posts already accumulated over 69,200 reactions, 14,600 comments, and 44,900 shares from social media users.", "lang": "en"}
