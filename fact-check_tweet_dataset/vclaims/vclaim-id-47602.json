Look at this. Howra Tikiapara. The picture speaks for itself - who's breaking lockdown to beat the police (translated from Bengali).\" One of the images showed a person wearing a t-shirt with an image of Narendra Modi. \n\n\n\nThe post is being shared in the backdrop of a mob attack on West Bengal police, that took place on April 28 when the cops tried to enforce lockdown in Howrah, which has been identified as a red zone for COVID-19.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on the photos, and came across a news report by The Telegraph from July 1, 2014, which carried one of the images. According to the caption, the image showed a BJP worker fight with a policeman during violent protests by the BJP against Akhilesh Yadav's government on June 30, 2014, for rising crime rates in the state.\n\n\n\nWhile the article did not carry the other image in the viral post, we found it being shared on image sharing website Imgur on July 2, 2014 - 2 days after the clash took place at the UP Assembly.\n\nWe compared the structure of the building seen in the photo with a more recent image of the UP Assembly building, and found it to be match. The date of the post and the resemblance of the venue helps us ascertain that this image is also from the clash between BJP workers and UP Police from June 2014.", "lang": "en"}
