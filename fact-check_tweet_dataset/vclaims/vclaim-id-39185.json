The claim is misleading; the World Health Organization (WHO) says drinking water does not prevent novel coronavirus infection; Japan has not issued a health advisory listing drinking water as a prevention method for COVID-19.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on February 28, 2020.\n\nIt has been shared more than 400 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post reads, in part: \u201cSERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases. Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY? Even if the virus gets into your mouth...drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in tummy...your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly...the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That's very dangerous.\u201d\n\nA similar claim was also shared here and here on Twitter.\n\nThis tweet on the WHO's official Twitter account states in part: \u201cWhile staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the WHO's tweet:\n\nThis video produced by the WHO gives advice on how to prevent coronavirus infection.\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which oversees the country\u2019s response to the novel coronavirus, has also not issued an advisory recommending frequent water intake.\n\nIn the \u201cAbout Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u201d section of its website, the ministry lists washing hands frequently and covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing as \u201ceveryday preventive actions\u201d to take.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant section of the website:\n\nThere is no mention of frequent water intake in any of the advisories it has issued. The advisories were published here, here, here and here on the ministry website.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked a similar misleading claim that keeping your throat moist can prevent coronavirus infections.", "lang": "en"}
