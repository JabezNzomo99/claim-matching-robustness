It found that about one in six people said they would either \u201cdefinitely not\u201d get the vaccine against Covid-19, or that they were \u201cnot very likely\u201d or \u201cnot at all likely\u201d to do so.\n\nKing\u2019s College, along with several newspapers, described this as evidence about how many people were likely to \u201crefuse\u201d a vaccine.\n\nOur fact check pointed out that people answering this question might not have been planning to refuse the vaccine at all, because they might have thought they were being asked whether they were likely to be offered it.\n\nSince our fact check, the team at King\u2019s has gathered more evidence, which suggests it is correct that at least one in six people might refuse a Covid vaccine, if one was available to them.\n\nHow did the new research come about?\n\nWhen we spoke to the researchers last summer, they agreed that the wording of the original question might have been ambiguous. Professor Bobby Duffy, Director of the Policy Institute at King\u2019s, told us, \u201cWe think this is a possible interpretation of the question, but also that it is unlikely to be a common one or a key driver of the patterns of response.\" King\u2019s also deleted the original webpage referring to the findings while they looked into the question.\n\nAs a result, Professor Duffy\u2019s team conducted new research in November, in which they asked two groups of 1,122 people whether they would be likely to get the vaccine\u2014but this time one of the groups saw the extra words \u201cif it was available to anyone who wanted it\u201d.\n\nThe study found that people gave fairly similar answers no matter which question they were asked. Indeed people who were told that the vaccine would definitely be available were more likely to say they wouldn\u2019t get it.\n\nThe new research does suggest that people don\u2019t say they won\u2019t get the vaccine, in answer to this question, because they believe they won\u2019t be offered it.\n\nThis in turn suggests that, in the summer, about one in six probably were likely to refuse it after all, and that this proportion was roughly the same in November.", "lang": "en"}
