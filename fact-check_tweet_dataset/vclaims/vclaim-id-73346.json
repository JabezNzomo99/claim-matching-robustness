But the claim is false; the Bank of Indonesia says that the new banknote is legal tender.\n\nThis post has been shared more than 200 times since it was posted on August 17, 2020.\n\nThe post shows two pictures of the newly issued Indonesian 75,000 rupiah banknote, alongside a long caption.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a part of the misleading post:\n\n\u201cCredible information says that the new 75,000 rupiah bill is not meant to be used as a Medium of Exchange, but rather it functions only as a kind of Merchandise, or memorabilia money, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Indonesian independence.\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian central bank, Bank of Indonesia (BI) issued a new Indonesian 75,000 rupiah bill on August 17, 2020, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Indonesian independence, hence it is also referred to as a \u201ccommemorative bill\u201d.\n\nThe same claim has also been shared hundreds more times after it being posted here, here, here and here on Facebook, and also here and here on Twitter.\n\nBut the claim is false; BI says that the new banknote is legal tender.\n\nThe Indonesian central bank said in a press briefing on August 18, 2020, that the new bill is legal tender and has the same function as the other existing banknotes.\n\nAt the 5:03 mark of the video, BI Deputy Governor Rosmaya Hadi can be heard saying: \u201cThe bill functions not only as a medium of exchange, but more importantly also a symbol of our national sovereignty.\u201d\n\nIn a Q&A found here, Bank of Indonesia also says that the new banknote is a \u201clegal tender\u201d that can be used within the territory of Indonesia.\n\nFurthermore, a sentence is printed on the back of the bill, which translates to English as: \u201cBY THE GRACE OF GOD ALMIGHTY, THE UNITARY REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA HAS ISSUED RUPIAH AS LEGAL TENDER WITH THE VALUE OF SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND RUPIAH.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
