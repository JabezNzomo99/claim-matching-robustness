I have to tell you, the Coast Guard saved 16,000 people. What do you think of that, Ben? Sixteen-thousand people. (Applause.) And I think \u2014 you know, honestly, they don\u2019t get enough credit in many ways.\n\n\"Mike made the commencement address this year at the Coast Guard Academy. I did it the year before. I don\u2019t think the Coast Guard gets enough credit. And I\u2019ve said it, and I even say it to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. I said, I think this year the Coast Guard, maybe in terms of increased branding \u2014 the brand of the Coast Guard has been something incredible what\u2019s happened. Saved 16,000 people, many of them in Texas, for whatever reason that is. People went out in their boats to watch the hurricane. That didn\u2019t work out too well. That didn\u2019t work out too well.\"\n\nThe Houston Chronicle said in a news story posted later the same day that law enforcement \"first responders\" were baffled by Trump\u2019s boating claim which, the story said, nobody could explain.\n\nThe story quoted Harris County\u2019s sheriff, Ed Gonzalez, crediting civilians with making an \"extraordinary effort\" with their own boats to rescue neighbors, relatives and pets as Hurricane Harvey flooded the Texas coast with 52 inches of rain. \"I didn't see anyone taking the approach that would reflect his comments,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nSeparately, Gov. Greg Abbott said he had \"no information one way or another about\" what Trump described and Coast Guard Petty Officer Edward Wargo told the Chronicle: \"I don\u2019t know how we would go about confirming that.\"\n\nOur search of the Nexis news database turned up a September 2017 Tampa Bay Times news story on a man rescued from a Florida shrimping boat overtaken by Hurricane Irma yet no news accounts on people taking boats out to watch hurricanes.\n\nWe later connected with Chad Saylor, a spokesman for the Coast Guard at its Washington, D.C., headquarters.\n\nSaylor had no comment on the president\u2019s boating claim, referring us to the White House, which offered no on-the-record response to our inquiry.\n\nSaylor otherwise advised by email that the Coast Guard, teaming with multiple law agencies, rescued nearly 12,000 people during the nation\u2019s 2017 hurricanes, mostly from rooftops in urban areas, Saylor said by phone.\n\nAdm. Paul F. Zukunft, the Coast Guard\u2019s commandant, said in a March 2018 speech that the agency responded to the year\u2019s hurricanes by dispatching nearly 3,000 first responders and more than 200 helicopters, cutters, small boats and fixed-wing aircraft. Of its rescues, Zukunft said: \"Most of those men, women, and children were rescued from the roofs and flooded streets of Houston, Beaumont, and Port Arthur, Texas\u2026 areas not generally accustomed to seeing Coast Guard helicopters circling overhead, dangling rescue swimmers into urban settings, as water engulfed their homes.\"\n\nA Sept. 7, 2017, Coast Guard news release says that in response to Hurricane Harvey, Coast Guard members helped rescue 11,022 people and 1,384 pets.\n\nChristopher Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also had no comment on Trump\u2019s claim. Vaccaro suggested by email that we contact the Coast Guard and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nWe also reached Bill Read, a resident of League City, outside Houston, and a former director of the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.\n\nBy phone, Read commented that he was unaware of anyone ever going out on a boat to watch a hurricane.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Read said. \"It\u2019s dangerous.\" Read said it\u2019d be \"insane\" to take a boat into the ocean to watch a hurricane because of tremendous storm-related currents and waves.\n\nInland in 2017, Read said, \"the people I know who were out on boats were trying to rescue people\" from Harvey-caused flooding.\n\nTrump, saluting Coast Guard rescues accomplished when hurricanes battered the U.S., also said: \"People went out in their boats to watch\" Hurricane Harvey.\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t provide nor did we find confirmation of people venturing out on boats to watch the hurricane. The boats we saw people using in Houston and elsewhere were to evacuate flooded homes and neighborhoods.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire.\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
