While Canada can receive record snowfall, this particular scene was photographed by a Romanian blogger in Japan in 2007.\n\nA popular meme depicting a road carved into an impressively deep snow canyon crops up each winter. Depending on the online user sharing it, the photo has been said to be in Canada, or the in US states of Massachusetts or Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile in Canada\u201d is a variation of a broader category of memes that feature the caption \u201cMeanwhile in\u2026\u201d followed by a particular geographical location. The visual content in those memes, meant to be humorous, attempts to confirm a certain preconceived idea of the place that the meme is portraying. Unsurprisingly, the subcategory \u201cMeanwhile in Canada\u201d often highlights themes related to the winter, cold, and heavy snowfalls.\n\n\n\n However, the photo in the meme was taken in 2007 by Mihai Apostu, a Romanian man living in Japan, who posted it on his blog at the time.\n\nThe road pictured in the photo above is the so-called Hakkoda Gold Line, in the Aomori prefecture in Northern Japan, featured in the video below.\n\nThe road is famous for the snow walls that border it, which sometimes reach 9 meters (30 feet), giving travellers the impression of advancing through a winding snow canyon.\n\nParts of Canada do receive considerable amounts of snow during the winter, and a simple Google search for snow walls in Canada brings up images and links to British Columbia\u2019s Whistler Mountain, where the snow remains long into summer.", "lang": "en"}
