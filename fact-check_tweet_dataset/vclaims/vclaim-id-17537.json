Although he considered a 1984 run, he ultimately did not enter the race.\n\nBiden declared his candidacy for president on April 25. Polling data released in the days before his announcement showed him leading the pack of Democratic challengers.\n\nThe meme quickly questioned Biden\u2019s prospects, however, stating that he had earned only one delegate at the Democratic National Convention in 1984, two delegates in 1988 and zero in 2008. \u201cYou really want this guy to try running for President again?\u201d it asks. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Never Receive More Than 1 Percent When He Ran For President?)\n\nBiden did win one delegate, or 0.03 percent of the vote, during the 1984 Democratic National Convention. However, he hadn\u2019t declared his candidacy for president that year. He filled out the necessary paperwork to be added to the primary ballot in one state, but did not submit the documents.\n\n\u201cI had no intention of running in 1984, and the people closest to me knew that,\u201d Biden wrote in his 2007 memoir, \u201cPromises to Keep.\u201d\n\nBiden successfully ran for re-election to the Senate that year.\n\nIn the 1988 election cycle, Biden did make a short-lived bid for the Democratic nomination, but withdrew after he was accused of plagiarism. He won two delegates, or 0.05 percent of the vote, at the Democratic convention, as the meme correctly states.\n\nBiden ran again in 2008, drawing early criticism after he called then-candidate Barack Obama \u201cthe first sort of mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.\u201d He dropped out in January 2008 after he placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, and during the 2008 convention, he received zero delegate votes.", "lang": "en"}
