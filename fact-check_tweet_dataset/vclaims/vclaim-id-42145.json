It has been captioned as, \"Can someone, who can kick an Amar Jawan memorial, be a citizen of India?? You tell!\" (Original caption in Bengali: \u09af\u09bf\u09a8\u09bf \u09b6\u09b9\u09c0\u09a6 \u099c\u0993\u09df\u09be\u09a8\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u09cd\u09ae\u09c3\u09a4\u09bf \u09b8\u09cd\u09a4\u09ae\u09cd\u09ad\u09c7 \u09b2\u09be\u09a5\u09bf \u09ae\u09be\u09b0\u09c7 \u09a4\u09bf\u09a8\u09bf \u0995\u09bf \u0995\u0996\u09a8\u0993 \u09ad\u09be\u09b0\u09a4\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09b7\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u0997\u09b0\u09bf\u0995 \u09b9\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09c7?? \u0986\u09aa\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09be\u0987 \u09ac\u09b2\u09c1\u09a8\u0964)\n\nThe viral post can be viewed here.\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 amends the Citizenship Act of 1955. It seeks to include foreign illegal migrants of certain religious communities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh eligible for Indian citizenship. The bill has resulted in violent protests in particularly in the Northeast, West Bengal and other parts of India.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found that the image is originally of Mumbai's Azad Maidan where protests by a local Sufi community, Raza Academy turned violent. Large number of Muslims had gathered to protest against the atrocities on Muslims in Myanmar and Assam. The rally soon turned into a riot like situation, when the crowd swelled to more than 40,000 and vandalisation of public property worth crores was reported. According to reports, the man, identified as, Abdul Quadir Mohammed Younus Ansari (19), was arrested for vandalism, after the Mumbai police identified him from photographs clicked by Mid-Day photo journalist Atul Kamble.", "lang": "en"}
