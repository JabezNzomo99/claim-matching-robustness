The caption in the post claims that the fruit is moon melon. It is scientifically known as asidus and grows in Japan. The post also states that the fruit switches flavors after you eat. Vishvas News has already debunked the post and found that it is fake.\n\nA post shared on social media purports to show a blue-colored fruit. The text in the post reads: Moonmelon (scientifically knows as asidus). This fruit grows in some parts of Japan and is known for its vibrant blue color. This fruit\u2019s party trick is that it can switch flavors after you eat it. Everything sour will taste sweet, everything salty will taste bitter, and it gives water a strong orange-like taste! Bucket list fruit! The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nWe investigated and found that the post is circulating online since 2011. \u201cAsidus\u201d isn\u2019t the scientific name of any real fruit.\n\nWe found that there is a fruit that alters the flavor profiles of anything tasted afterward. However, that fruit isn\u2019t a moon melon. It is actually a small red berry called miracle fruit. There exists a fruit that hacks your taste buds. But, it isn\u2019t moon melon, it actually is red miracle berry.\n\nThe complete fact check of the post can be read here.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Mr. Neeraj Kant, Assistant Director (Horticulture) at NDMC. He said: This viral picture showing the fruit named Moonmelon is fake and seems digitally manipulated. No such fruit exists.\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named Anton Dimitrov. We scanned the profile of the user and found that he based out of Sweden.\n\nConclusion: The post showing a blue-colored food named blue moon melon is fake. It is a digitally manipulated photo. It was earlier fact checked but has not resurfaced on social media.", "lang": "en"}
