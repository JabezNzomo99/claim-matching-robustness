That means it doesn\u2019t happen under standard World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\n\nBut EU trade agreements don\u2019t affect tariffs on all goods and services. Some goods and services have the same tariff level for countries the EU has trade agreements with and those it doesn\u2019t.\n\nIf the UK were to leave the EU with \u201cno deal\u201d, we would go back to trading under WTO terms with these countries.\n\nThe WTO prevents discriminatory tariffs, except between countries with trade deals\n\nIn a nutshell, the WTO is an international organisation aiming to reduce all barriers to trade. Most countries around the world are members, including the UK.\n\nThe WTO requires member countries to apply tariffs (taxes) on goods and services to other WTO countries equally. It also means you can\u2019t set different rules for foreign and domestic products in your country. The big exception is if countries have negotiated their own customs union or free trade area.\n\nYou can read more about how the WTO works here.\n\nMost of our trade is with countries the EU has a trade agreement with\n\nThe main exception to WTO trade rules that apply to the UK is that we\u2019re a member of the EU customs union and so have free trade with other EU members. In 2016 44% of our exports in goods and services went to other EU countries and 54% of our goods and services imports came from EU countries.\n\nThe EU also has trade agreements with other countries, like Israel and South Korea. Countries where there is an EU trade agreement in place accounted for a further 12% of our imports and 13% of our exports.\n\nThe EU also has \u201cpreferential trade agreements\u201d with various other countries. This is where one country grants preferential tariffs on imports from developing countries. As these arrangements are unilateral (they\u2019re one way and so don\u2019t require a two-way trade deal), we\u2019ve not included these countries in our calculations.\n\nSo in total 57% of our exports and 66% of our imports happen with countries we have some trade agreement with as part of the EU. The EU has also negotiated or is in the process of negotiating trade deals with other countries, including Japan and Australia.\n\nHowever WTO rules don\u2019t always mean tariffs\n\nFree trade agreements that change tariffs between countries from the WTO default don\u2019t necessarily affect all goods and services. While 57% of the UK\u2019s exports go to the EU or other countries with which we have some kind of trade agreement, that doesn\u2019t mean that a \u201cno deal\u201d situation would mean new tariffs on 57% of our exports.\n\nFor example, take bottled beer. At the moment the EU, and therefore the UK, has no trade deal with the USA and it pays no tariffs on the bottled beer it exports there.\n\nIf the UK was to revert to trading with the EU under WTO rules following Brexit, there would similarly be no tariffs on the export of UK bottled beer to the EU.", "lang": "en"}
