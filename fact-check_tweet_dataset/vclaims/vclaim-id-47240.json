While the Indian Army informed that 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the clashes, there is no confirmed information regarding the number of Chinese casualties though unofficial figures put them at more than 30. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the videos.\n\nThis video pops up on social media and is also used as a representational video by multiple news agencies whenever there is a border stand-off between India and China. But, the video is related to a conflict that took place on 15 August 2017 between Indian and Chinese soldiers near Pangong lake in Ladakh. The same video was debunked multiple times by FACTLY previously.\n\nThis \u2018exclusive\u2019 video is also not related to the recent India-China clash that took place on the night of 15 June 2020. The same video is on the internet at least since May 2020. While there is no authentic information regarding the context and location of the video, it can be concluded that it is not related to the recent India-China fight on 15 June 2020.\n\nThe same video is being circulated on the internet at least from 2017. The \u2018Deccan Herald\u2019 has posted the same video on YouTube in July 2017 with the title \u2013 \u2018Watch: Jawans stop Chinese soldiers from entering Indian territory Part 1\u2019. So, this video is also old and not related to the recent fight.\n\nMost of the visuals shown in this video are old. They are not related to the recent incident. The same visuals can be seen in multiple old news articles regarding various other incidents, which can be found here, here, here, here, and here.\n\nThe same video was found to be uploaded by a YouTube user on 13 January 2020 with the title \u2013 \u2018Chinese army arguing with Indo Tibetan Border Police (I.T.B.P.) in Border of Arunachal Pradesh\u2019. So, the video is not related to the recent incident in Ladakh in June 2020.\n\nThe video is an old one. It is not related to any recent incident. The video was telecasted by \u2018Zee News\u2019 channel on 25 August 2014 and reported that the Chinese troops have tried to destroy a border wall along the Tawang district in Arunachal Pradesh but the Indian forces had obstructed them. The channel has not mentioned the exact time of the incident. So, it can be concluded that it is not related to the recent India-China clashes in June 2020 as the video was telecasted in 2014. The same video was also previously debunked by FACTLY.\n\nThere are few other videos which are being shared on social media with the same context. They have been debunked by FACTLY in separate articles, which can be read here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, old videos are being shared again in the context of recent India-China clashes in the Galwan valley (Ladakh).\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
