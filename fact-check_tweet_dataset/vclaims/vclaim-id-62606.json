Pelosi never issued such an invitation.\n\nTrump made the claim in remarks at the White House May 22 at a ceremony honoring veterans, describing what he said were Pelosi\u2019s actions a month after his administration announced travel restrictions on China on Jan. 31. The restrictions barred foreign nationals who had been in China in the past 14 days, other than the immediate families of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, from entering the country.\n\nAs we have written, Pelosi traveled to Chinatown on Feb. 24 in an effort to bolster the neighborhood\u2019s restaurants and shops. Their business had fallen sharply in the wake of the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China, late last year.\n\nThe visit came three weeks before six Bay Area counties implemented shelter-in-place restrictions. On the day of Pelosi\u2019s visit, Trump tweeted this about the virus: \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d\n\nWhile, as we have written, Trump announced the travel restrictions at the end of January, he also downplayed the danger of the virus in a series of remarks and tweets from Jan. 22 to March 10.\n\nThe Pelosi-goes-to-Chinatown riff has been a staple at Trump appearances over the past several months. As we have reported, Trump referred to the visit six times in April at White House coronavirus task force briefings, each time describing inaccurately what transpired.\n\nTrump variously said Pelosi held a \u201crally\u201d in Chinatown, was having or wanted to have \u201cparties\u201d or a \u201cstreet party\u201d there and encouraged people to go to a \u201cbig parade.\u201d In fact, Pelosi never mentioned parties or rallies, and the \u201cbig parade\u201d \u2014 the Chinese New Year Parade \u2014 took place on Feb. 8, two weeks before Pelosi went there.\n\nIn May, Trump shifted to references to Pelosi \u201cdancing in the streets of San Francisco in Chinatown.\u201d She didn\u2019t.\n\nPelosi did walk the streets of Chinatown Feb. 24 and urged people to return to its shops and restaurants.\n\nPelosi, Feb. 24: [W]e should come to Chinatown. Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern surrounding tourism, traveling all throughout the world, but we think it\u2019s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come. It\u2019s lovely here. The food is delicious, the shops are prospering, the parade was great. Walking tours continue. Please come and visit and enjoy Chinatown.\n\nTrump and Pelosi have long been at odds, and the president was angered by the decision of the House to impeach him. In March, a Pelosi aide said the two hadn\u2019t spoken in five months.\n\nAs his latest comments reflect, Trump was not pleased by Pelosi\u2019s criticism that he had responded too slowly to the coronavirus. On March 29, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d she said, \u201chis denial at the beginning was deadly. His delaying of getting equipment to where \u2014 it continues \u2014 his delay in getting equipment to where it\u2019s needed is deadly.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Trump returned fire on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nTrump, March 30: Look, she\u2019s a sick puppy in my opinion. She really is. She got a lot of problems. And that\u2019s a horrible thing to say, especially when I was the one \u2014 and, you know, I\u2019ve gotten from fair people, you know, a lot of accolades, and I don\u2019t want the accolades but it\u2019s just in service of a fact. When I stopped some very, very infected, very, very sick people, thousands coming in from China long earlier than anybody thought, including the experts.\n\nIn his May 22 remarks, Trump repeated another claim, that he \u201cwas very early\u201d with his travel restrictions, but that is not the case. As we have reported, 36 countries, including the U.S., had imposed travel restrictions by Feb. 2, the day the U.S. restrictions went into effect.\n\nThe president also repeated a false claim that he \u201cwas the only \u2014 the one that wanted to do it.\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the decision came from \u201cthe uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.\u201d\n\nSo, yes, Pelosi did go to Chinatown in February to encourage people to eat and shop in the neighborhood. But she certainly didn\u2019t invite foreign nationals to \u201cbring your infection\u201d there.", "lang": "en"}
