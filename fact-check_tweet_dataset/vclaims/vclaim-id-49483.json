The claim is false; the photo, taken in 1998 in the West African country Sierra Leone, actually shows unvaccinated children who contracted polio.\n\nThe image was posted by a New Zealand-based Facebook user here on June 30, 2020. The post has been shared more than 200 times.\n\nThe text superimposed above the image reads: \u201cThis was the results of the Vaccine trials on Africans. And no one has even answered for this. Keep your vaccines\u201d.\n\nThe Facebook post's caption states: \u201cFuck bill gates and your vaccines.\"\n\nAFP reported here that false claims targeting Gates, an advocate for vaccines, have gained traction since the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe image has also been shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found an image showing similarly-dressed children in this photo collection titled \u201cWAR ON POLIO\u201d.\n\nThe collection was published by French photographer Jean-Marc Giboux, who said he took the photo in the misleading posts in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone in 1998.\n\n\u201cI was documenting the polio vaccinations for WHO and these kids [featured in the photo] are polio victims, showing the effects of no vaccination against polio,\u201d Giboux told AFP in a July 7 email. \u201cSince there was no place to get reconstructive surgery in Sierra Leone because of the civil war, they grew up with the consequence of polio, without any vaccination.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also said in a July 7 email that Giboux was on contract for the global health agency when he took the photo. Some of Giboux\u2019s work covering polio for the WHO is available online here.\n\nPoliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is an infectious viral disease that can attack the nervous system and cause paralysis. The disease \u201clargely affects children under 5 years of age,\u201d according to the WHO.\n\nVaccines have been critical in stopping polio in many parts of the world, but children are still vulnerable to the disease in Sierra Leone.", "lang": "en"}
