Lee Terry (R-Neb.).", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-02-02T18:57:38Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82786", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/05/07/new-obamacare-attacks-a-round-up/", "vclaim": "We also regret not finding the time to fact check the radio ad by Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), which claimed that GOP hopeful Thom Tillis (R) had said that Obamacare was a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d This ad, featured on Tuesday in a Washington Post article, snips only a tiny bit of the full quote: \u201cThe majority of the stuff that is in Obamacare is bad, because it\u2019s not fiscally sustainable. It\u2019s a great idea that can\u2019t be paid for.\u201d That\u2019s pretty drastic surgery, spurring PolitiFact to label it as \u201cmostly false\u201d \u2014 roughly equivalent to Three Pinocchios.\n\nIn April, The Fact Checker faulted Paul\u2019s Senate colleague from Kentucky, Mitch McConnell (R), for claiming that only 68,000 people in the state had received private coverage compared to 280,000 who had received cancellation notices. You will notice that under McConnell\u2019s math, that\u2019s a 4 to 1 ratio, suggesting that perhaps the figure in Paul newsletter was a typo. (A Paul spokesman initially missed our query; see update below.)\n\nBut even so, McConnell earned Four Pinocchios for his claim. He was using outdated figures (the state had reduced to 168,000 the number of plans that had been canceled) and comparing apples and oranges (private plans versus private plans and small-group plans.) The real ratio, at the time, was closer to 1 to 1 if you are only counting private plans.\n\nBut Kentucky actually signed up many more people for Medicaid \u2014 nearly 331,000 people, according to state officials. The latest number for private-plan sign-ups is close to 83,000. That adds up to more than 413,000 people, which is more than double the number of plans (individual and small-group) that were canceled. In other words, the reality is positive for Obamacare, not negative.\n\nUpdate: Paul spokesman Brian Darling says that the staff failed to update a line that appeared in Paul\u2019s newsletter in November. At the time, Kentucky reported 7,000 sign-ups for private plans, and the newsletter was measuring that against 280,000 canceled private and small-group plans. This is the same sort of apple-and-oranges use of outdated numbers that earned McConnell Four Pinocchios. Instead of a remedial math class, maybe the staff in Paul\u2019s office should start keeping up with the news.\n\nThis is another one of those Obamacare victim stories. Andrea Kodad, a mother of two, was shocked to discover that her plan was canceled and her premiums were going up from $446 a month to $726. The ad shows the text of the letter indicating the increase \u2014 and she holds up the letter at the end of the ad, with Rep. Terry at her side. (Mea culpa: an earlier version of this column reversed the lawmaker\u2019s name as \u201cTerry Lee.\u201d Oops, Pinocchios to the Fact Checker!)\n\nIn a television interview in November, Kodad described how the family\u2019s co-insurance jumped from 15 percent to 50 percent and their out-of-pocket expenses had increased by $2,000. It\u2019s certainly a story that apparently resonated with Terry, as he cited her story on the House floor when he cast a vote for the Keep Your Plan Act of 2013, which would have allowed families to keep their noncompliant plans for another year. (The bill did not pass the Senate but the White House took administrative action allowing extensions that was accepted by most states.)\n\nWe don\u2019t doubt the details of the increase \u2014 as we have often said, Obamacare created winners and losers \u2014 but there is one strange aspect to this story. The Obama administration has since urged states to allow the extension of noncompliant plans until 2016, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska, Kodad\u2019s insurance company, prominently displays the notice on its Web site, saying plans can be extended for another two years. \u201cBCBSNE extends \u2018keep your plan\u2019 until 2016,\u201d the headline declares.\n\nIn other words, Kodad \u2014 who declares \u201cObamacare is not good for my family\u201d \u2014 extended her plan and thus is not paying the higher rate. There is no \u201cfinancial struggle.\u201d She did not respond to a query left at her employer.\n\nUpdate, 11 am: Kodad called The Fact Checker but declined to go into details about her health plan unless The Fact Checker met her in person at her home in Omaha. \u201cI am really not interested in being a one-time soundbite,\u201d she said. \u201cI am doing this as a PSA [public service announcement].\u201d She acknowledged that her old plan had been rolled over but said that \u201cthe spirit of the ad\u201d was to highlight \u201cwhat the true Obamacare costs are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never said they did go up that amount but rather when she got the notice \u2014 that was the reality she was confronting,\u201d said Kurt Bardella, a spokesman for the Terry campaign. \u201cObamacare is creating that kind of uncertainty. Can anyone deny that the bottom line is that at some point, when all the delays and changes expire, which they will unless ObamaCare is repealed I guess, she\u2019s not going to be able to keep the plan that she likes and had come to rely on.\u201d\n\nThe ad certainly leaves the impression Kodad had to give up her plan. Given the circumstances, her tale of woe from November seems rather out of date. Indeed, one has to ask: Isn\u2019t there any other \u201cvictim\u201d in Nebraska?", "lang": "en"}
