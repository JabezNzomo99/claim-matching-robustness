Sudha Murthy resigns from Thirupathi board. Jagan appoints his uncle YEHOVA VINCENT Subbareddy( YV SUBBARADDY) -a staunch Evangelist as chairman of TIRUPATI TUMALA BALAJI TEMPLE, richest Hindu shrine He works to spread more CHURCHES in Andhra.\n\nThe above message was tweeted by Madhu Kishwar, who has posted misinformation on several occasions in the past. Kishwar has alleged that Andhra Pradesh CM Jagan Mohan Reddy had appointed his uncle, allegedly \u201ca staunch evangelist\u201d, as the chairman of the Tirumala Tirupati temple trust, displacing author and chairperson of Infosys Foundation Sudha Murthy, who was a member of the board. Kishwar in her tweet claims that the full name of Y V Subba Reddy, Jagan Mohan Reddy\u2019s uncle, is Yehova Vincent Subbareddy. Subba Reddy was recently appointed to the post.\n\nHer tweet has been retweeted over 6000 times and \u2018liked\u2019 over 8400 times since it was posted on June 11. Earlier, the same claim had been made in a tweet posted by a user Ritu Rathaur, who is followed on the platform by the Office of Nirmala Sitharaman, and Union Minister Giriraj Singh.\n\nThe Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) is an independent trust established for the management of the Tirumala Venkateshwara temple in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe above user is followed on Twitter by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nY V Subba Reddy\u2019s full name is Yarram Venkata Subba Reddy and NOT Yehova Vincent Subba Reddy, as claimed by Madhu Kishwar in her tweet. This was confirmed by Subba Reddy himself, who retweeted a tweet in response to Madhu Kishwar, in which a copy of his poll affidavit was attached.\n\nIn his defence, Subba Reddy tweeted a screenshot of an article in which he has been quoted as saying that he is a Hindu since birth.\n\nMoreover, Andhra Pradesh police has been asked to take stern action against those spreading false propaganda against Y V Subba Reddy.\n\nInterestingly, speculation about Y V Subbareddy\u2019s appointment before his eventual confirmation, was followed by aggressive editing of his Wikipedia page, suggesting that he is a \u2018converted Christian\u2019. His page was later \u2018protected\u2019 due to \u2018persistent vandalism\u2019. More than 200 edits were made to the page before it was shielded from further alteration.\n\nAuthor and chairperson of Infosys Foundation, Sudha Murthy has clarified that her resignation from the board of the TTD was not political.\n\nIn a conversation with The News Minute, Murthy said, \u201cWe were appointed by previous govt and it is not nice to continue without an invite. My decision was not political, it was just the decent thing to do.\u201d She added, \u201cMy resignation has nothing to do with who becomes new TTD chairman. If the new government invites me, I will join\u201d.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Y V Subba Reddy\u2019s full name is Yehova Vincent Subba Reddy is outrightly false, and so is the implication that Sudha Murthy was edged out in order to make way for a Christian to helm the temple trust.", "lang": "en"}
