Greg Abbott. The president joked with Rutledge about the size of the investment.\n\nThe president said Charter\u2019s announcement is the latest example of companies \u201cthat have recently announced billions of dollars in investment and thousands of jobs coming into the United States following my election victory.\u201d\n\nBut, as we have written a few times before, Trump has taken credit for job creation that actually was already in the works. That\u2019s the case with Charter.\n\nThe company had been promising to add 20,000 jobs for nearly two years as part of its efforts to win federal and state approval for its $55 billion merger with Time Warner Cable and $10.4 billion purchase of Bright House Networks.\n\nIn June 2015, The Hollywood Reporter quoted Rutledge as saying the company would relocate overseas call center jobs to the U.S. as part of the cable company\u2019s effort to improve service quality. In all, the company would need 20,000 new employees, Rutledge said.\n\n\u201cQuality can save you money, so we are believers in hiring people to work for us and not sending calls offshore \u2014 hiring actual employees and training and investing in them as opposed to contractors,\u201d Rutledge said.\n\nThe promise of 20,000 jobs was repeated as the company went through the process of receiving federal and state approvals for the merger.\n\nIn January 2016, for example, Charter issued a press release touting the public benefits of a merger a week after the New York Public Service Commission approved its deal to buy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks \u2014 a \u201csignificant step,\u201d as Rutledge put it, toward final approval of the merger. In the release, the company said it would create 20,000 jobs \u2014 \u201cincluding thousands of jobs brought back to the United States\u201d \u2014 if the merger received final approval.\n\n\u201cWe understand the importance of demonstrating why the transactions are in the public interest, which is why we continue to engage with regulators, stakeholders and the public about the benefits New Charter will bring to customers \u2014 including fast unlimited broadband, increased broadband buildout, a commitment to the Open Internet, innovative video services and 20,000 new jobs, including thousands of jobs brought back to the United States,\u201d the corporate release said.\n\nCharter completed the takeover of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in May 2016 after the merger was approved by the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nAt a June 23, 2016, Senate oversight committee hearing, Kathleen \u201cKip\u201d Mayo, the company\u2019s executive vice president for customer relations, told senators that the company would relocate jobs from overseas call centers to the U.S.\n\n\u201cAs part of our transaction with Time Warner Cable, Charter expects to hire 20,000 American workers, many of whom will fill customer service jobs that are currently outsourced to call centers located in other countries,\u201d she said.\n\nNevertheless, Trump took credit for the 20,000 jobs.\n\nThe White House issued a press release \u2014 \u201cPresident Trump Delivers on Jobs for the American People\u201d \u2014 that not only touted the 20,000 jobs, but specifically noted that Charter \u201cwill be opening a brand new call center in McAllen, Texas, where the company will create 600 new American jobs.\u201d\n\nThe Texas governor spoke at the White House about the McAllen call center, praising Trump for \u201cliving up to his campaign promise\u201d to create more jobs and \u201creturning jobs from overseas back to the United States.\u201d\n\nBut the McAllen, Texas, jobs, too, were in the works before Trump won the presidency.\n\nRutledge, Charter\u2019s CEO, discussed moving call center jobs from overseas to the U.S. in a second quarter earnings call with industry analysts on Aug. 9, 2016. He cited the McAllen call center as an example.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already began in-sourcing efforts for the new company. The process of in-sourcing will take several years and will require that we hire 20,000 people, train them and equip them with trucks, tools and test equipment and house them in new and expanded facilities,\u201d Rutledge told the analysts. \u201cThat process has already started as we are building Charter\u2019s first Spanish language call center in McAllen, Texas with approximately 600 seats.\u201d\n\nWe asked Charter spokesman Justin Venech what\u2019s new about the White House announcement. Although the company previously announced the 20,000 U.S. jobs, Venech said, the time frame for the hiring is new. It will happen over four years, he told us. But that\u2019s not much different from the time frame of \u201cseveral years\u201d that Rutledge gave analysts last August.\n\nVenech also said the $25 billion investment is new. But the Hartford Courant reported that the Connecticut-based company was expected to make such a large investment over the next several years.\n\n\u201cMarket analysts were expecting the company would spend roughly $30 billion on capital expenditures, such as buying cable boxes and maintaining its network, through 2020,\u201d the paper wrote.\n\nWe asked Craig Moffett \u2014 a telecommunications industry analyst for MoffettNathanson who participated in Charter\u2019s Aug. 9, 2016, earnings call \u2014 if he saw anything new in the White House announcement about the company\u2019s 20,000 jobs and $25 billion investment.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Moffett told us. \u201cThe entire announcement appears to be a restatement of commitments that were first made informally as early as 2015, and made more formally in early 2016, at least six months before the election.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
