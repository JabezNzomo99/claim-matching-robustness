They are considered part of the overall labor force. In other words, you have to be seeking a job to be counted in the labor force.\n\nThe BLS, since it is mostly interested in whether people are working, generally does not ask why people are not seeking a job. \u201cOur survey is designed to measure work and looking for work,\u201d said Karen Kosanovich, a BLS economist. \u201cWe do not focus on people outside of the labor market.\u201d But some information can be gleaned from the BLS data. The BLS examined some of the attributes of the 94 million in a report using 2014 data, but Kosanovich updated the information for The Fact Checker using 2015 data.\n\nAbout 40 percent of the 94 million were 65 years and over (including about 19 percent age 75 or older), indicating they were retired. About 12 percent were between ages 16 and 19, indicating they were still in school. About 25 percent had a disability, though just over half of the people with a disability who were not in the labor force were 65 years and over.\n\nOf the 41 million people ages 16 to 54 who were not in the labor force, roughly a third were enrolled in school in 2015. People ages 16 to 24 account for a large majority\u2014about 85 percent\u2014of these 15 million students not in the labor force.\n\nFinally, of the people who were not in the labor force in 2015, about 14 percent (13 million) were parents of children under age 18. This includes about 4 million people not in the labor force with a child under 3.\n\nThere may be some overlap in these numbers \u2014 a person with children might also be enrolled in school \u2014 but generally the picture that emerges is that the 94 million figure consists mostly of people who are retired, students, parents or disabled.\n\nOnly 6 million people (6.3 percent) who in 2015 were deemed not in the labor force said they wanted a job, though 3.5 million had not searched for one in the previous year. About 1.3 million who said they want a job actually had family responsibilities, were on disability or were in school \u2014 factors that were holding them back from a job hunt at the time. Only 664,000 \u2014 less than 1 percent of the 94 million \u2014 said they were discouraged about their job prospects.\n\nOn a technical note, while Trump claims that the 94 million are \u201cnot part of our economy,\u201d that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of economics. People in retirement, on disability or in school are still part of the economy, as they buy goods and services with their Social Security checks, disability payments, tuition fees and so forth. Their money helps create jobs for people who actually want to be in the labor force.\n\nAs you can see, it is absurd to claim that 94 million Americans are on the sidelines of the economy and are part of a \u201cjobless America.\u201d You can\u2019t be jobless if you don\u2019t want a job.\n\nOnly a small percentage of these people want a job, as the rest are retired, in school, on disability or caring for children. No matter how much Trump wants to suggest the economy is on the rocks, the fact remains that the unemployment rate is below 5 percent \u2014 which is pretty good by any measure.", "lang": "en"}
