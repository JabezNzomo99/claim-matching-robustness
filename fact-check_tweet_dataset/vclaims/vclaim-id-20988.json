It then adds anti-Trump sentiment for effect. We emailed the website that created the post, LeftScoop.com, to ask about the post and why the site did not include its sources but didn\u2019t get a reply. The post was removed shortly after our inquiry.\n\nThe LeftScoop.com article starts by using several slightly edited paragraphs from a June 22 story from the Santa Barbara Independent, a weekly alternative newspaper based in Santa Barbara, Calif. \"Labor shortage leaves $13 million in crops to rot in fields,\" the newspaper article\u2019s headline read. The LeftScoop.com post also borrows from a 2017 Mother Jones article.\n\nThe Independent\u2019s story said that the county\u2019s agricultural industry has suffered labor shortages from 15 to 26 percent annually for five consecutive years. It cited Grower-Shipper Association of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties statistics that said $13 million worth of strawberries, broccoli and other produce were plowed under, up from $4.4 million worth five years ago. Other outlets have cited the Independent story when writing about the subject.\n\nLeftScoop.com\u2019s post implied Trump was largely to blame for the lost crops because he had scared off Mexican migrant workers with his tough policies, causing the labor shortages.\n\nClaire Wineman, the Grower-Shipper Association\u2019s president, told us Santa Barbara County has been experiencing the same lack of workers felt by agricultural areas across California and the United States.\n\nThe dollar figure in the story came from an annual survey the Grower-Shipper Association sent to local farmers, asking them to quantify how much gross revenue they estimated they had lost due to a lack of a sufficient number of field workers. The total from 68 respondents amounted to $13.5 million for the 2015 calendar year.\n\n\"We absolutely have been experiencing labor shortages over the last few years,\" Wineman said. The Independent\u2019s story, she said, did a fair job of describing the reasons, which go back years before Trump took office.\n\nOne thing the Independent story (and therefore the LeftScoop.com post) did misrepresent was in the headline, Wineman said. The survey didn\u2019t determine whether the crops went unharvested and rotted in the fields.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t survey what happened, we only asked how much revenue was not realized because of a lack of workers,\" Wineman said. \"We just don\u2019t know that.\"\n\nLeftScoop.com said, \"Over $13 million worth of crops have ROTTED in California, all because no one is willing to work jobs vacated by migrants.\"\n\nThe post, which has since been removed, is almost entirely copied from uncredited articles from two more reputable news outlets.\n\nThere is a labor shortage in central California\u2019s agricultural corridor, but that $13 million is just for Santa Barbara County, not the whole state, as was implied. The association that determined the total also noted there was no data on whether the crops had really been left to rot in fields. The dollar figure was measured through a survey of farmers\u2019 potential lost revenue.\n\nAs for the reasons for the shortage, LeftScoop.com drastically oversimplifies the issue in the text by interjecting that Trump\u2019s immigration policies are to blame for a lack of migrant workers. For starters, the data is from 2015, more than a year before Trump became president.\n\nThis post is partially accurate, but not much more. We rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
