Kerry, there is no standard document but almost all such agreements address whether a country has criminal jurisdiction over U.S. personnel. Some SOFAs may be as short as one page while others have exceeded 200 pages. The United States has signed more than 100 such agreements, almost all bilateral, although an important multilateral agreement is with NATO, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nA key sticking point was whether the SOFA could exist as simply a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or needed formal approval by the Iraqi parliament. Maliki was willing to sign an MOU, but administration lawyers concluded that parliamentary approval was needed, in part because parliament had approved the 2008 version. Moreover, there were serious questions about whether an MOU signed by the prime minister would really be binding, especially given Iraq\u2019s independent judiciary.\n\nBut politically it was much more difficult to win parliamentary approval of a SOFA that would have have allowed U.S. troops to be prosecuted for crimes outside Iraq, under U.S. jurisdiction \u2014 especially because of fierce opposition from a key Shiite parliamentary bloc that backed Maliki. Indeed, his political survival depended on the support of the Sadrist bloc that was dead-set against any presence of U.S. troops.\n\nSome experts believe that the administration stumbled when a more moderate bloc, headed by former prime minister Ayad Allawi, won the most seats in the 2010 parliamentary election but could not form a government. A subsidiary question is whether the number of troops Obama offered to remain in Iraq was enough to make worthwhile such a politically difficult choice for Iraqi leaders. Questions certainly could be raised about whether the administration took too long to settle on a troop number \u2014 but it\u2019s also uncertain whether Maliki would have sought more troops.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear that Maliki wanted that many troops,\u201d said Colin H. Kahl, who was deputy assistant secretary of defense at the time and closely involved in the talks. \u201cIndeed, he was conscious of the extreme unpopularity of a continued U.S. presence with his [Shiite] constituency and he had no interest in a sizable U.S. presence along the Arab-Kurd divide (which is what all our big troop options assumed). Moreover, the immunities issue would not have likely been resolved even if the administration started negotiations earlier and offered more. It was simply too toxic, politically, for Iraqi politicians to accept.\u201d\n\nKahl added: \u201cIronically, part of the difficulty in securing an agreement stemmed from our success. The Iraqi security forces were now much more numerous and capable, so Iraqi politicians were not as desperate for us to stick around. They recognized the value of a continued U.S. presence, but it was not so valuable that it was worth the domestic political risk or to prioritize the national interest over their desire to outflank their political rivals.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator McCain is correct that Iraq\u2019s main political blocs were supportive of U.S. forces remaining in Iraq after 2011, but the situation was quite complex. The Bush administration, to obtain a status of forces agreement with Iraq in 2008, agreed that all troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2011. The U.S. military, with my support, urged the president to reconsider that decision in late 2010, early 2011. The president agreed to urge PM Maliki to accept some U.S. troops after 2011, and that decision was made public in June 2011. It is correct that there was considerable debate within the administration on the size of the force, but there was agreement that it would be a training presence. In the end, everyone on the U.S. side accepted a force of 5,000 personnel including short-term deployments. While the major political parties with the exception of the Sadrist movement supported a U.S. military presence, only the Kurdish parties, about 20 percent of the parliament at best, supported parliament-granted legal immunities for U.S. military personnel. It was the considered position of the administration, including the U.S. military and myself, that our forces could not remain without a parliament-endorsed agreement granting such immunities, and so our forces were withdrawn in accordance with the 2008 agreement.\u201d\n\nExperts may disagree about whether the administration wasted valuable time or sent mixed signals about the level of troops it was willing to commit. But there is little debate that a parliamentary vote would have failed, unless the SOFA was watered down in ways that Republicans and the military found unacceptable \u2014 and broad consensus that an MOU would have been too risky for U.S. troops.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 2, 2014: An excerpt from former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta\u2019s memoir made us conclude that we should withdraw the Pinocchio. \u201cPrivately, the various leadership factions in Iraq all confided that they wanted some U.S. forces to remain as a bulwark against sectarian violence. But none was willing to take that position publicly,\u201d writes Panetta, who pins the blame on the White House for failing to use its leverage to get a deal. \u201cTo my frustration, the White House coordinated the negotiations but never really led them. Officials there seemed content to endorse an agreement if State and Defense could reach one, but without the President\u2019s active advocacy, Maliki was allowed to slip away.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
