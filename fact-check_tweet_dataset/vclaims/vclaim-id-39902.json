Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Kim Jong-un has warned the people who are conspiring to kill Narendra Modi. Fact: The news article in the \u2018janta se rishata\u2019 website gives information credit to \u2018orientaltimes.in\u2019, whose domain is expired now. Also, no credible news source was found to have published about these statements by Kim Jong-un. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the photo, it can be seen that the article was published on the \u2018janta se rishata\u2019 website. On the website, it can be found that the information credit for the article was given to \u2018orientaltimes.in\u2019. But, that website domain is expired now. On the Twitter handle of \u2018Oriental Times India\u2019, it can be seen that they have published similar articles that Kim Jong-un has commented praising Modi. But, when searched on Google for comments by Kim Jong-un on Modi, it was found that no credible news agency has published anything about Kim Jong-un commenting on Modi.\n\nTo sum it up, Kim Jong-un has not warned the people who are conspiring to kill Modi.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
