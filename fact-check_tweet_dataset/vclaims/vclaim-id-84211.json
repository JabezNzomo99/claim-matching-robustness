The photo is being shared in a misleading context; it is actually an Associated Press news agency photo which was taken in June 2015 in Pakistan.\n\nThe photo can be seen in this May 5, 2019 Facebook post which has been shared more than 14,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe photo shows two men holding a burning Indian flag. Behind them, a banner carries the words: \u201cIndia is Supporting Terrorism\u201d alongside a photo of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe Hindi-language text superimposed on the image translates to English as:\n\n\u201cAppeal to President, those who burn the Indian flag in the country, they should be immolated in the middle of the street (don\u2019t associate this with religion).\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post's Hindi-language caption says: \u201cWhy are you burning the Indian flag while opposing Modi, son of 72 fathers.\u201d\n\nThe post was also shared elsewhere on Facebook with an identical caption for example here, here and here, and on Twitter here with a similar caption.\n\nSome of the comments on the Facebook post suggest that people believed the photograph showed an incident in India.\n\nOne user wrote in Hindi: \"If you guys don't love our country then leave this country, or else Modi is coming for you.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that comment with the user's identity redacted:\n\nBut the image was not taken in India. It is actually an Associated Press news agency photo from June 2015 and shows a protest in Pakistan against Modi after his remarks on India\u2019s role in the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the original image here on the AP website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo on the AP website:\n\nThe original AP caption states: \u201cPakistani protesters burn an Indian flag during a protest in Multan, Pakistan, Thursday, June 11, 2015.\n\n\"Pakistan has reacted angrily to comments made by the Indian prime minister that reportedly acknowledged Indian forces had a role in the war that created Bangladesh, part of Pakistan until 1971 when separatists won independence after a war.
