It has been doctored to make it look like the event was staged.\n\nTrump made an unannounced visit to Bagram Air Base, the main American base north of Kabul, Afghanistan, on Thanksgiving Day. Shortly thereafter, a number of social media users began circulating claims about Fox News staging a photo of the president\u2019s surprise visit.\n\nThis Facebook post features an alleged screen grab of a Fox News broadcast showing American soldiers cheering and clapping during this visit. A sign appearing to bear the words \u201cuniversal,\u201d \u201cnational\u201d and \u201cstudios\u201d can be seen in the background.\n\n\u201cFox propaganda posts a fake picture to show soldiers excited to see Trump in Afghanistan \u2026 forgets to take out the Universal Studios sign in the background,\u201d the Facebook post said.

Taken by Agence France-Presse photographer Olivier Douliery, the original picture has no sign visible in the background, just a plain beige wall. The words appear to have been photoshopped into the image.\n\n\u201cUS Soldiers react with cheers and applause as US President Donald Trump arrives in Bagram Air Field during a surprise Thanksgiving day visit, on November 28, 2019 in Afghanistan,\u201d reads the caption.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s a fake,\u201d Douliery told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email.\n\nFox News told FactCheck.org that it never aired the image. The DCNF also didn\u2019t find any record of Fox News airing it.\n\nOther media outlets, including Axios and the Daily Mail, included the image in their reporting of Trump\u2019s surprise visit. Those instances didn\u2019t have the sign that appears in the Facebook post.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
