He\u2019s got patents.\u201d\n\nThe basis for these two distinct claims is likely a Politico article published on Friday, about the 2012 refinancing of debt on a New York building of which Trump owns 30 percent. The Bank of China was one of several financial institutions to put forth funds for the property\u2019s new mortgage. The deal put the building\u2019s owners, including Trump, in debt to the Bank of China. After the article was published, however, the Bank of China revealed it had sold its share of the debt. Politico updated the piece on Saturday, to include a statement from a bank representative, who stated: \u201cBank of China has not had any ownership interest in that loan since late November 2012.\u201d However, due to conflicting information on a public record for the building, Politico was not able to confirm this until Monday evening, and published a full explanation of why the initial story was incorrect that night, after Biden\u2019s interview had aired.\n\nBiden\u2019s second claim is closer to the truth. Trump does not have any patents from the Chinese government, but he and his family do have a number of trademarks approved by China, a number of which the Trumps received after the president assumed office. Because of Trump\u2019s refusal to divest from his companies, concerns have been raised that these trademarks may violate the Foreign Emoluments Clause, which prohibits elected officials from accepting presents from other countries. A lawsuit on this very issue was recently heard by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which found that the plaintiffs\u2014more than 200 Democratic members of Congress\u2014lacked standing to file the suit, leaving the constitutional issue undecided.\n\nWhile Biden was wrong to say Trump owes money to the Bank of China, he is correct that the president has intellectual property registered with the Chinese government, though Biden used the incorrect term in describing the intellectual property.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
