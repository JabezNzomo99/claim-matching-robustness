The claim originates from a satire website.\n\nMany companies released statements voicing their support for protests against police brutality and racial inequality after George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis police custody, according to BBC News. In recent days, some social media users have shared posts claiming Chick-fil-A will forgo its practice of closing on Sundays for black people.\n\n\u201c#chickfila Now Open On Sunday But Only For Black People,\u201d reads a June 19 Instagram post. \u201cChick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy announced yesterday that his fast-food restaurant will be ending its long-standing policy on Sunday closure, but only for black people.\u201d (RELATED: Did Chick-Fil-A Issue \u2018Back The Blue\u2019 Shirts In Response To Recent Protests Against Police Brutality?)\n\nBut the Instagram post\u2019s claim is inaccurate. Chick-fil-A is known for being closed every Sunday, a practice stemming from founder Truett Cathy\u2019s Christian faith, so such a change in policy would have been picked up by media outlets, yet no credible reports could be found. Nor is there any mention of a change in the restaurant\u2019s operating hours on Chick-fil-A\u2019s website.\n\nThe claim appears to stem from an article, titled \u201cChick-Fil-A Now Open On Sunday But Only For Black People,\u201d that the satirical website The Babylon Bee published on the same day as the Instagram post. The text and image of the Instagram post appear to be lifted nearly word-for-word from the satirical article.\n\nThe Babylon Bee includes clear disclaimers that the article should not be taken as fact, describing itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s best satire site.\u201d The Instagram post, however, fails to include any indication that the story is satirical, leading some social media users to share it as real news.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
