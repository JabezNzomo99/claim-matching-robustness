The clip was re-uploaded by Youtube channel TOKHANG TV.\n\nDakila.info\u2019s headline does not reflect CNN Philippines\u2019 story, which only reported that inspectors from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources detected \u201csmelly\u201d waste water coming from MOA\u2019s bayside area. Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu is having the waste water tested for possible pollutants and disease-causing pathogens.\n\nThe misleading story came five days after President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a major DENR-led cleanup of Manila Bay, where he also warned nearby establishments to refrain from using the bay as their dumping ground.\n\nDakila.info\u2019s story could have reached more than 548,000 people; its top traffic generators are Facebook pages Pres. Rody Duterte Worldwide Supporters, Bagong Pag-asa ng Pilipino and Pinoy Republic.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
