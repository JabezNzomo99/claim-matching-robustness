The screenshot has been tweeted by one Pinku Shukla, who has a following of around 85,000 which includes cabinet minister Piyush Goyal, the office of Nirmala Sitharaman and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya. (archive)\n\nThe screenshot of NDTV India has also been posted on Facebook with the identical message.\n\nOn the basis of these posts, Opindia published an article titled, \u2018SRK \u0928\u0947 \u0959\u0941\u0926 \u0915\u094b \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0926\u093f\u0928 \u0935\u093f\u0936 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0916\u0930\u094d\u091a \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u090f \u20b92 \u0915\u0930\u094b\u095c? \u0938\u094b\u0936\u0932 \u092e\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092a\u0930 \u091a\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u091a\u0930\u094d\u091a\u093e\u201d (Did SRK spend 2 crore to wish himself on his birthday? Social media abuzz- translation). The article referred to a Dubai based news website Arabian Business, which informs readers about the cost of using the facade of the Burj Khalifa for marketing or promotion. However, this article contains nothing about the supposed expense of Rs 2 crore by Shahrukh Khan. Several Twitter users shared the article by Opindia.\n\nAlt News received requests on the official app for verification.\n\nTo fact-check this image, Alt News perused the NDTV India website and found one report pertaining to Shahrukh Khan published on his birthday. The title of the report found on the NDTV India website is, \u2018\u0936\u093e\u0939\u0930\u0941\u0916 \u0916\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u0930\u0902\u0917 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0902\u0917\u093e \u0926\u0941\u092c\u0908 \u0915\u093e \u2018\u092c\u0941\u0930\u094d\u091c \u0916\u0932\u0940\u092b\u093e\u2019, \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0939\u0941\u0902\u091a\u0940 \u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092d\u0940\u0921\u093c\u2026\u0926\u0947\u0916\u0947\u0902 \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0932 Video\u2019 (Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa splashed with image of Shahrukh Khan, big growd gathers to watch. view viral video- translation).\n\nIn the below image, the difference between the actual NDTV India report and the viral screenshot has been shown.\n\n1. The date of the publication.\n\n2. The pictures in the report.\n\n3. The caption of the images.\n\nAs can be seen, the title in both is different and so is the font.\n\nNDTV India\u2018s report was photoshopped and shared on social media. Images of reports by media organizations are often photoshopped, in order to depict the information as genuine, like this photoshopped graphic of News18 which credited PM Modi for the death of IS chief Baghdadi. In another instance, an image of an Aaj Tak promo was photoshopped and shared.", "lang": "en"}
