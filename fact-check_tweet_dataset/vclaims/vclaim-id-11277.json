But in remarks in Borden, Ind., Cruz tried to take some solace by looking at the numbers a different way.\n\n\"I earned more votes in the state of Wisconsin than Donald Trump did in New York,\" .\n\nIs that right? We took a closer look.\n\nHere\u2019s the final results of the April 5, 2016, Wisconsin Republican primary, according to the Associated Press :\n\nAnd here are the final results of the April 19 New York Republican primary:\n\nSo Cruz did win more raw votes in Wisconsin (531,129) than Trump did in New York (524,932). It\u2019s a modest edge -- Cruz won about 1.1 percent more votes in Wisconsin than Trump did in New York -- but an edge nonetheless.\n\nThe discrepancy owes much to two factors: Wisconsin\u2019s , which was two and a half times higher than New York\u2019s, and the Republicans\u2019 greater strength in purplish Wisconsin than in solidly blue New York.\n\nIn Wisconsin, about 24 percent of the voting-age population cast a Republican primary ballot. In New York, it was just 5.6 percent.\n\nThat helps explain why Cruz eked out more raw votes than Trump even though Trump won the much bigger state and almost three times as many delegates.\n\nCruz said, \"I earned more votes in the state of Wisconsin than Donald Trump did in New York.\" This is certainly a glass-half-full way of looking at the results, but factually, Cruz is on target.", "lang": "en"}
