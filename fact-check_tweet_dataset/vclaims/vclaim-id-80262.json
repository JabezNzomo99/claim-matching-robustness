A reverse image search and Google mapping data showed the photo was actually of an elevated highway in New Taipei City in Taiwan. Taipei local authorities confirmed the road was in Taiwan and provided a photograph showing the cars on the highway driving on the right. Indonesia drives on the left.\n\nThe photograph was posted by a group called Jokowi Presiden RI 2019 -- which translates as Jokowi for Indonesian President in 2019. The group supports the country's leader, Joko Widodo, in his 2019 re-election bid. Widodo is popularly known as Jokowi.\n\nThe post had nearly 4,000 reactions and 1,500 shares.\n\nThe post's caption says: \"This is a fact and not a hoax... This is not the Himalayas, Switzerland, or Canada, but in Papua, Indonesia. Great work for the people. Not a big mouth who sells lies to the people .... Jokowi is great...\"\n\nJokowi's bid for a second term has focused on a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure building programme, including developing poor regions such as Papua.\n\nA Google reverse image search found that the elevated highway is actually in New Taipei City in Taiwan.\n\nThis image taken by the global photo agency Getty Images lists Taiwan as the location, specifically: New Taipei City, Wu-Yang Highway.\n\nAnother Getty photo of the road says in a caption: \"This is the new highway between Wuku to Yangmei in Taiwan.\"\n\nAccording to Google Maps data, the road is actually the \"Wugu Yangmei Elevated Section\" in Taipei.\n\nThe highway can be seen in this Google Maps link:\n\nTaiwan's Transportation Ministry told AFP that the Facebook photo was of the Wu-Yang Highway.\n\nThe ministry provided a similar photo of the road, taken in daylight, which shows vehicles moving on the right side of the road.\n\nTraffic in Indonesia drives on the left hand side of the road.", "lang": "en"}
