But do \u201chalf the kids who drink before the age of 18\u201d develop alcohol dependence?\n\nThis claim was made on a street poster put up by\n\nthe Association for Alcohol Responsibility and Education (\n\nalcohol industry\u2019s response\u201d to concerns about alcohol misuse and abuse. \u201cOur members include leading manufacturers of alcoholic beverages, such as SAB, Distell, Diageo, KWV, DGB and many others,\u201d it says on\n\n, spotted in Johannesburg by Africa Check, was part of a \u201charm reduction education and awareness\n\nIs the claim based on solid research? We checked.\n\nAware.org CEO Ingrid Louw told Africa Check the statistic was from\n\n. The article was based on\n\nBut the institute told us its research did not support Aware.org\u2019s claim.\n\nDr Aaron White, senior scientific advisor to the NIAAA\u2019s director, said the\n\nthe prevalence of alcohol dependence was 9% for people who started drinking before the age of 15, 6.8% for people who started between 15 and 17, and 4.1% for people who started at 18+\u201d.\n\nIf the claim were accurate, 50% of people who started drinking before 18 would be alcohol dependent, White said.\n\nThe article was based on two waves \u2013 from 2001 to 2002, and 2004 to 2005 \u2013 of the NIAAA\u2019s National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. \u201cThe entire final sample of Wave I and II was 34,653 but the analyses in the paper were based on 22,316 people,\u201d White said.\n\nIt was a US study, he said, so its findings could not be applied to the South African population.\n\nThe researchers found that people who had started drinking before 15 were more than twice as likely (133% more likely) to develop alcohol dependence than those who had started at 18 or older. For the age group 15 to 17, it was 1.7 times as likely (70% more likely), White said.\n\nBut the relationship between the age at first drink and alcohol dependence \u201cbecame much weaker\u201d when the risk factors for alcohol dependence were taken into account. These factors include mental health conditions and a family history of alcoholism.\n\n\u201cAfter the adjustments, those who started drinking before the age of 15 were 1.4 times as likely (38% more likely) to develop dependence as those who started at 18+. Starting at 15 to 17 was no longer a risk factor for alcohol dependence compared to those who started at 18+.\u201d\n\nWhite said the research suggested that the\n\nof alcohol a young person consumed was \u201ca more powerful predictor of developing alcohol dependence\u201d than\n\n\u201cAfter taking the amount of alcohol people reported drinking into account, the relationship between age of first drink and the risk of developing alcohol dependence\u2026 disappeared.\u201d\n\nAs the US study does not support the claim, we tried to find relevant South African research.\n\nwho had studied alcohol use in South Africa\n\nif they knew of local studies on the link between underage drinking and alcohol dependence.\n\nNeo Morojele, professor in the department of psychology at the University of Johannesburg, said studies that tracked people over time would be the best way to investigate the claim. \u201cI am not aware of any relevant ones that have been done in South Africa.\u201d\n\nThe claim was \u201cunlikely to be true\u201d, she said.\n\nDr Saiendhra Moodley, public health medicine specialist at the University of Pretoria, said the prevalence of underage drinking in South Africa \u2013 and World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of the prevalence of alcohol dependence \u2013 suggest\n\n\u201cIt is a risk factor but not to the extent suggested.\u201d\n\n49% of Grade 8 to 11 pupils had used alcohol, and 32% had done so in the month before the survey.\n\nthat in 2016, 2.4% of the South African population aged 15 and older\n\ndirector of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Research Unit at the Medical Research Council, said it was \u201ctoo early to say\u201d whether this data proves or disproves Aware.org\u2019s claim. That\u2019s because the claim doesn\u2019t make it clear\n\nOne would have to follow up with the 49% for say 10, 20 or 30 years.\u201d\n\nAdrie Vermeulen, national coordinator of the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency, was not aware of \u201cany\u201d South African studies \u201clinking underage drinking with adult\n\nConclusion: Research doesn\u2019t support claim that 50% of people who start drinking before 18 become alcohol dependent.\n\nA South African non-profit organisation claimed that half the people who start drinking before 18 develop alcohol dependence.\n\nThe US research said to support the claim did not come to this conclusion. We could not find any South African study that supported the claim.", "lang": "en"}
