Ted Cruz, makes a sweeping but false claim about Clinton's abortion stance.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-04-01T07:00:31Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-84808", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/04/01/firoinas-claim-that-hillary-clinton-supports-abortion-up-until-the-moment-of-birth/", "vclaim": "First of all, most abortions take place early in the pregnancy. One-third take place at six weeks or pregnancy or earlier; 89 percent occur in the first 12 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Only 1.2 percent of abortions\u2014about 12,000 a year\u2013 take place after 21 weeks. (The Supreme Court has held that states may not prohibit abortions \u201cnecessary to preserve the life or health\u201d of the mother.)\n\nOn top of that, Guttmacher says that 43 states already prohibit some abortions after a certain point in pregnancy, such as fetal viability, in the third trimester or after a certain number of weeks. So this is already a rare procedure that is prohibited in much of the country.\n\nIn Romania, she recalled, the dictatorship decided it was the duty of every Romanian woman to have five children. So birth control and sex education was eliminated \u2013 and every month women were rounded up at workplaces to be examined if they were pregnant. Women who failed to conceive had to pay a celibacy tax of up to 10 percent of their salary, Clinton said.\n\n\u201cSo whether it was Romania saying you had to have children for the good of the state, or China saying you can only have one child for the good of the state, the government was dictating the most private and important decisions we make as families and as women,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nIt\u2019s at that point Clinton offers the observation that the \u201cgovernment should have no role.\u201d Clinton immediately added: \u201cI believe we can all recognize that abortion in many ways represents a sad, even tragic choice to many, many women\u2026.This decision is a profound and complicated one; a difficult one, often the most difficult that a woman will ever make.\u201d\n\nWhen Clinton was running for the Senate in 2000, a debate moderator actually noted that in some states a woman can \u201cchoose to abort a child either six months into the pregnancy or perhaps almost up to birth.\u201d The moderator asked whether the candidates supported a government saying there are circumstance under which an abortion is not permitted.\n\nClinton answered: \u201cI have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I\u2019ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it\u2019s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nBAIER: Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it\u2019s born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy?\n\n CLINTON: Well, again, let me put this in context, because it\u2019s an important question. Right now the Supreme Court is considering a decision that would shut down a lot of the options for women in Texas, and there have been other legislatures that have taken similar steps to try to restrict a woman\u2019s right to obtain an abortion. Under Roe v. Wade, which is rooted in the Constitution, women have this right to make this highly personal decision with their family in accordance with their faith, with their doctor.\n\n It\u2019s not much of a right if it is totally limited and constrained.\n\n So I think we have to continue to stand up for a woman\u2019s right to make these decisions, and to defend Planned Parenthood, which does an enormous amount of good work across our country.\n\n BAIER: Just to be clear \u2014 without any exceptions?\n\n CLINTON: No. I have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother.\n\n I object to the recent effort in Congress to pass a law saying after 20 weeks, you know, no such exceptions, because although these are rare, Bret, they sometimes arise in the most complex, difficult medical situation.\n\n BAIER: Fetal malformities and\u2026\n\n CLINTON: And threats to the woman\u2019s health.\n\n BAIER: Sure.\n\n CLINTON: And so I think, under Roe v. Wade, it is appropriate to say, in these circumstances, so long as there\u2019s an exception for the life and health of the mother.\n\nWe readily concede that some abortion opponents believe the \u201chealth\u201d exception for abortion is a huge loophole that allows a woman to get an abortion very late in her pregnancy. But the fact remains that Clinton is on record as accepting that there can be restrictions to abortion well before the imminent birth of the baby.\n\nBut that does not excuse Fiorina\u2019s sweeping claim that Clinton \u201csupports that a child can be aborted any time up until the moment it is born,\u201d especially if her only evidence is an out-of-context quote from 11 years ago. Fiorina can criticize Clinton for her abortion stance but she can\u2019t falsely assert that Clinton favors aborting a full-term baby.", "lang": "en"}
