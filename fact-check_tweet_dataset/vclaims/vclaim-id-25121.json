They are the saviours of our country. Jai Hind Jai Bharat) (translation). This is the message that has been shared along with the image.\n\nThe above post is by a Facebook page Hindustani Sena which has a massive following of close to 2 million. It has also been posted by another page Bharatiya Yoddha, where it has been shared over 1900 times so far. The photograph has been posted and shared widely, particularly by individual users on Facebook.\n\nThe image is NOT representative of the Indian army. It has been taken from a video which is available on YouTube.\n\nThe above video was posted in December 2017 and was shot at Lake Superior, the largest of the five Great Lakes of Northern America on the USA-Canada border. The video has been posted by one Jerry Mills and shows a man surfing the lake in sub-zero temperature. The name of the surfer is Dan Schetter aka Surfer Dan.\n\nThe description accompanying another YouTube video says, \u201cMeet our legendary local surfer, Dan Schetter, aka Surfer Dan, one of a small group of locals who surf Lake Superior even in the most extreme conditions. This day was really extreme as the wind chill was -30. I was out there capturing footage for my Jerrysim series and almost got frostbite on my right hand trying to capture this moment as well as his ride into shore. His ice beard says it all about the severe cold. Filmed at Presque Isle Park in Marquette, MI, on the southern shore of Lake Superior, in Michigan\u2019s magnificent Upper Peninsula.\u201d\n\nSimilar kinds of posts have been shared time and again on social media. For instance, a photograph of Russian/Ukrainian soldiers had been passed off as Indian army soldiers stationed at Siachen.", "lang": "en"}
