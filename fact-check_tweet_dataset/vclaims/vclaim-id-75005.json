But if you click, all you find is jibberish.\n\n\"Robert Redford Says: Michelle And Barack Obama Should Get Five Years In Prison,\" reads the headline on newsdonaldtrumps.com. There is no story, however, to accompany the headline, just stray text about dental implants and tooth extractions.\n\nThe page also includes an image copied from an interview Redford gave to Vanity Fair in January 2016. The image does not include any mention of the Obamas, and neither does the full Vanity Fair article.\n\nIn reality, Obama awarded Redford the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November 2016.\n\nThis particular hoax -- that an actor says Obama and/or his wife should be sent to prison -- appears to be a favorite of people who peddle misinformation.\n\nSimilar hoaxes say Clint Eastwood, Nicole Kidman and Jeff Bridges all made the same claim.\n\nNone of them should be trusted.\n\nA blog claimed in a headline actor Robert Redford said Michelle and Barack Obama should get five years in prison. But that\u2019s rubbish.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
