The post by Facebook page Kashmirat - on August 22 has been shared more than 900 times till the time of filing this story.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral photograph is not from Kashmir but Gaza. It was clicked way back in December 2008. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nAFWA ran a reverse search and found the untampered version of the image in the stock of Getty Images.\n\nThe caption attached to the image says: Samera Baalusha (34) (R) sits with her surviving daughter Eman (15) and son Mohammad (15 months) while waiting to see the body of her daughter Jawaher Baalusha (aged 4) during the funeral held for her and four of her sisters who were killed in an Israeli missile strike, on December 29, 2008 in the Jebaliya refugee camp, in the northern Gaza Strip.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the viral photograph has nothing to do with Kashmir, as it is an 11-year-old image from Gaza.", "lang": "en"}
