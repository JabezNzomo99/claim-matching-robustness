Dale Kooyenga condemned what he called the \"Wisconsin Grinch\" -- the state\u2019s minimum markup law.\n\nThe law \u2014 most commonly known for setting baseline prices for gas, alcohol and tobacco products \u2014 actually prohibits far more than that, he said.\n\n\"The minimum markup law also forbids retailers from selling most other products below cost,\" said the Brookfield Republican. \"That makes many doorbuster deals and holiday shopping specials technically against the law. It\u2019s essentially a state-mandated profit margin.\"\n\nCould doorbusters really be illegal?\n\nThe minimum markup law \u2014 technically called the Unfair Sales Act \u2014 dates back to the Great Depression. It seeks to ensure fair competition among businesses by taking aim at \"loss leaders\" -- items priced below cost to draw in customers for other purchases, or to drive a competitor out of business. Several other states have similar laws.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau described the law\u2019s origin this way in a 2019 informational paper:\n\nThe Unfair Sales Act took effect in the 1930s with the intent of preventing predatory pricing by large firms. It was thought that large firms could reduce prices below cost to levels smaller firms could not match. Larger firms would incur short-term losses but drive smaller firms out of business. It was thought the remaining large firms would use near-monopoly power to charge exorbitant prices after smaller firms were mostly forced from the market.\n\nThe law itself describes selling below cost as \"a form of deceptive advertising and an unfair method of competition in commerce.\"\n\nThese pricing limitations have remained on the books despite efforts from both parties to limit them.\n\nRepublican lawmakers proposed repealing the law, or parts of it, in 2015 and 2017, to no avail. The repeal was opposed by numerous agriculture and business and tourism interests, and favored by just one registered entity \u2014 Walmart, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.\n\nAnd in 2019, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers hit a wall with a budget proposal to repeal the minimum markup for gasoline.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection enforces the law, along with local district attorneys. Violators can face forfeitures of up to $500 for first-time offenders and $2,500 for repeated violations, but there is no active monitoring of pricing since the agency only investigates based on complaints.\n\nFor example, someone filed a complaint in 2015 when Meijer, new to the area, was selling bulk instant coffee for $4.98, the Milwaukee Business Journal reported.\n\nBut no one has been fined for such a violation in at least a decade, said Ti Gauger, spokesman for the department.\n\nSo what exactly is banned?\n\nThe law is best known for its effect on prices for gas, alcohol and tobacco products. Each of these must be marked up 3% above cost by the wholesaler and 6% by the retailer, the statute says.\n\nBut the law also says all other products cannot be sold below the seller\u2019s cost under a section titled \"illegality of loss leaders.\"\n\nIt says sales under cost \"with the intent or effect of inducing the purchase of other merchandise or of unfairly diverting trade from a competitor, impairs and prevents fair competition, injures public welfare and is unfair competition. \u2026 Such sales are prohibited.\"\n\nAs proof of Kooyenga\u2019s claim, spokesman Chris Rochester pointed to the statutory wording above and a 2017 memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau that summarized the law as generally prohibiting sales below cost.\n\nThat said, the statute does offer a number of exceptions where sales below cost are allowed, including sales for charity, under court order or as part of a government contract. These are the other five exceptions spelled out in the law:\n\nStatutes can be open to some interpretation, but we\u2019ll assume the \"clearance sales\" referenced are where retailers are clearing out excess stock, or making way for new stock. And doorbusters won\u2019t always involve matching a competitor\u2019s documented price. The other three wouldn\u2019t apply to doorbusters.\n\nThat leaves a swath of low-priced specials that would appear to violate the law if below cost.\n\nIt\u2019s often assumed that doorbuster deals like those on Black Friday are sold below cost, as referenced in reports published by CNBC, the Washington Post and others.\n\nBut Jerry O\u2019Brien, an expert on retail industry trends at the University of Wisconsin, said the actual invoice cost is \"incredibly difficult\" to pin down.\n\nThat\u2019s because agreements between vendors and retailers often depend on many factors outside of actual production cost. They can factor in whether one side is providing advertising, whether the vendor provides in-store services, such as keeping the item stocked, and how returns are handled. For example, the vendor could lower the price by a set percentage if the retailer agrees to simply discard returns instead of sending them back to the vendor.\n\n\"I\u2019m really not sure anyone in the state is openly breaking the law. I\u2019d say the law has a lot of room for wiggle,\" said O\u2019Brien, executive director of the Kohl\u2019s Center for Retailing Excellence. \"When you\u2019ve got these giant vendors selling to these giant retailers, they\u2019re negotiating some amazing invoices that would probably stand up (to the law\u2019s requirements).\"\n\nKooyenga\u2019s office did not respond to a request for evidence of specific retailers that have sold below cost in Wisconsin.\n\nKooyenga said in a letter to constituents that \"many doorbuster deals and holiday shopping specials are technically against the law.\"\n\nThe Unfair Sales Act does generally ban prices below cost in Wisconsin, with some exceptions. And there have been reports over time of stores offering loss-leaders or below-cost prices to get customers through the door.\n\nBut Kooyenga\u2019s claim assumes Wisconsin retailers actually routinely sell doorbusters below cost. His office didn\u2019t provide proof of that element, and the state hasn\u2019t fined anyone for doing that in at least a decade. What\u2019s more, a retail expert said the nuances involved in the deals between vendor and retailer make it very difficult to pin down the actual invoice cost.", "lang": "en"}
