Germany's app is up and running and India says its app has had 131 million downloads and traced 900,000 people to tell them to isolate.\n\nContact-tracing apps are downloaded to people's smartphones and the idea is that if somebody tests positive for Covid-19, the app will be able to report whether they have been in close contact with anybody else who had downloaded the app.\n\nThe number of downloads is clearly crucial to the success of a contact-tracing app because the more people who have it the more likely you are to detect an infection.\n\nIndia made it mandatory for government and private sector employees to download it. There has been some controversy about the app and the government published its source code last month following concerns about security and privacy.\n\n\"The point is that these apps are working, but not yet reaching sufficient percentages of the population to be relied on as the sole means of contact tracing,\" he said.\n\nIt has not been a completely smooth process though - there have been complaints that the system drains the phone battery, which has led some people to switch it off.\n\nMarcel Salath\u00e9 - an expert in digital epidemiology who advises the Swiss contact-tracing app initiative - referring to Boris Johnson's claim said: \"I'm not sure what he means; Switzerland, Latvia, Italy, Germany and Denmark already have functioning proximity tracing apps, many other countries are releasing theirs in the coming days and weeks.\"\n\nSo the French government clearly thinks its app is working, even if downloads have been somewhat low so far.", "lang": "en"}
