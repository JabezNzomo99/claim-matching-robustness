(It had not even been determined which provisional ballots were valid and would be counted.) These claims were then picked up by such purveyors of false facts as Infowars.com, a conspiracy-minded website, even though Phillips declined to provide any evidence to back it up.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s tweet, the Trump transition team then scrambled to come up with proof, but could only resurrect claims and data that had been previously rejected as irrelevant during the campaign. None of the information supported Trump\u2019s claim of \u201cmillions\u201d of illegal votes, just isolated instances of voting irregularities.\n\nAs of December, just four documented cases of voter fraud have been identified. Our colleague Philip Bump calculated that voter fraud amounted to 0.000002 percent of the ballots cast in the race for the White House \u2014 if they counted, which they don\u2019t.\n\nAs we noted in November: \u201cNow that Trump is on the verge of becoming president, he needs to be more careful about making wild allegations with little basis in fact, especially if the claim emerged from a handful of tweets and conspiracy-minded websites. He will quickly find that such statements will undermine his authority on other matters.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false.
