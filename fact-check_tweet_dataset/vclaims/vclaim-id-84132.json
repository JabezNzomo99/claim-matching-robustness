A look at where that number comes from\n\nWhen Kenya\u2019s Interior Minister Fred Matiang\u2019i announced tougher measures on the betting industry earlier this month, he cited -- as evidence that the country has a serious problem with gambling -- a claim that 76 percent of young Kenyans are involved in the practice, \u2018leading on this continent\u2019. In fact, the figure comes from a survey that only looked at six countries.\n\nMatiang\u2019i cited the figure at a press conference on April 1, during which he announced that gambling companies will have their permits revoked if they do not provide proof by July 1 that they have paid their taxes.\n\nThe minister signalled that he wanted the Kenyan betting sector to face stricter regulations, particularly since so many young people in the country gamble.\n\n\u201cWe have the unfortunate situation where we in Kenya are leading on this continent on the population of our young people involved in betting. 76 percent of our young people are involved in one form of betting or the other,\u201d he said.\n\nHe went on to ask: \u201cWhat kind of country are we building? Are we raising our children and telling them, \u2018Just do nothing with your life, just go around betting and become a millionaire and live well\u2019? Is that the kind of thing that we\u2019re telling our country and our children?\u201d\n\nWhere did the 76 percent figure come from?\n\nMatiang\u2019i did not cite his source for the 76 percent claim, and many news reports simply quoted him giving the figure without asking where it came from.\n\nSome web users queried the source of the information.\n\nWe decided to track down its source.\n\nThe 76 percent figure appears to have come from a March 2017 survey by GeoPoll, a US-based research company.\n\nThe survey looked at betting among young people in six African countries -- Ghana, South Africa, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda as well as Kenya -- and indeed found that 76 percent of Kenyan respondents said they had gambled.\n\nThe survey sampled 3,879 respondents aged between 17 and 35 across the six countries -- of which 1,130 were in Kenya, GeoPoll marketing director Roxana Elliott told AFP via email.\n\nSo is it fair to say that 76 percent of young Kenyans gamble?\n\nNot quite. Matiang\u2019i, speaking at the press conference, suggested that 76 percent of young Kenyans were currently involved in gambling.\n\nThe study by GeoPoll clearly states that respondents were asked if they had gambled in the past. It would be more accurate to say that 76 percent of young Kenyans say they have gambled at some point, according to the survey.\n\nHaving said that, of the Kenyans who said they had gambled at some point, more than half said they gambled once a week.\n\nAs per this chart included in the study, that\u2019s a higher rate than in any of the other countries where people were surveyed.\n\nThe minister said that Kenya was \u201cleading on this continent on the population of our young people involved in betting\u201d. This is not necessarily true, as the survey only looked at six countries. It\u2019s still possible that another African country may have higher gambling rates.\n\nBut it is fair to say that young Kenyans reported higher gambling rates than in any of the other countries surveyed.\n\nCan we be sure that the survey data accurately reflects the reality of gambling habits among young Kenyans?\n\nNo surveying method is perfect. GeoPoll collects information from people using a mobile phone app, and the company says on its website that it \u201crecognizes that the mobile population does not always perfectly match the national population\u201d.\n\nKenya has some of the highest rates of mobile phone use in Africa -- in December, the Communications Authority of Kenya announced that the country now has more SIM cards than people. That suggests that surveying people via mobile phone is a fairly effective method of surveying people in Kenya.\n\nBut even after you narrow down the pool of people answering questions to those who own mobile phones, there\u2019s still the question of which people to pick within that pool.\n\nOn its Frequently Asked Questions page, GeoPoll details how it tries to choose a group of respondents that is broadly representative of the wider population, by matching the demographics of the survey group to census data. Kenya\u2019s last census was in 2009 -- it is due to hold the next one in August 2019. So we should bear in mind that the data used as a basis for selecting participants in the 2017 survey would have already been rather out of date.\n\nSurveys are never going to perfectly reflect reality, so it\u2019s better not to cite figures that have come from surveys as if they were facts. That said, the GeoPoll survey appears to be the most recent and most thorough survey available on the subject of youth gambling in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWhy do so many young Kenyans gamble?\n\nOnline data reflects a widespread love of betting in Kenya. According to an annual report for 2019 by Hootsuite and We Are Social, 11 of the top 20 Google search queries in Kenya last year were directly related to betting.\n\nSportPesa, a Kenyan sports betting platform, currently ranks as the country\u2019s 11th most popular website according to the website ranking site Alexa.\n\nMany commenters responding to social media posts about Matiang\u2019i\u2019s comments suggested that the reason so many young Kenyans gamble is that so many of them are unable to find jobs.\n\nAloyce Omondi, an official at the Association of Gaming Operators Kenya, backs this theory.\n\n\u201cI can tell you it is because of unemployment,\u201d he said of the popularity of gambling among young Kenyans. \u201cInitially gambling was a leisure activity for the rich, but currently young people are viewing it as a way to make money quickly and become millionaires,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Africa Check explained in October, talking about youth unemployment in Kenya is a tricky issue because, while few would deny that many young Kenyans are out of work, various youth unemployment rates are cited by different publications.\n\nThe International Labor Organization (ILO) estimated that youth unemployment in Kenya stood at 26.2 percent in 2018 compared to an overall unemployment rate of 11.5 percent. A 2017 report by the British Council also estimated that 500,000 to 800,000 youths were annually entering a job market that is struggling to absorb them.\n\nIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind, however, that Kenya was not the only country surveyed which is struggling with high levels of youth unemployment -- South Africa\u2019s youth unemployment rate was listed as an eyewatering 53.8 percent by the ILO.\n\nOmondi suggested that another reason for the high gambling rates in Kenya was that placing a bet is particularly easy in the country due to loose regulations up until now. Mobile gambling has taken off as an industry without changes in the regulation keeping pace, he told AFP.\n\n\u201cThere is a lacunae in the law in regards to mobile gambling. If you have a phone and internet you can easily go online and gamble with no regulations at all. But there is need to regulate the industry,\u201d he told AFP by phone.\n\nLike others, Dr Ken Ouko, a sociologist at the University of Nairobi, drew a link between high youth gambling rates and \u201cthe alarmingly high levels of youth idleness arising from either joblessness or transitory limbo as they wait to join colleges and universities\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn Kenya the advertising frenzy by betting firms has also contributed to the trapping of the youth\u2019s collective imagination,\u201d he told AFP.", "lang": "en"}
