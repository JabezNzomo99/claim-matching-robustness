The Daily Caller traced the photo back to The Associated Press website, and according to the image caption, it actually shows a black man being dragged from a street car during a June 1943 race riot in Detroit.\n\nOn top of $2 million in damages, the riot reportedly left 34 dead and 700 injured, according to the Detroit Historical Society.\n\nThe picture also appears in a collection of newspaper clippings related to the 1943 riot, housed at the University of Michigan\u2019s Bentley Historical Library. \u201cWoodward crowd pictured after it had stopped a street car and was in the act of dragging a Negro passenger into the street,\u201d reads the photo caption, referencing Woodward Avenue, a historic roadway in Detroit.\n\nAccording to the library, it was published in the June 22, 1943 issue of The Detroit Free Press, featured in a collage of pictures from that riot.\n\nThough black people were lynched or attacked after World War I, as the Facebook post notes, there is nothing to suggest the man being pulled from the street car in the photo was himself a uniformed service member or lynched.\n\n\u201cI do not recall any reference of a lynching during the 1943 riot,\u201d Dominic Capeci, a historian at Missouri State University and co-author of \u201cLayered Violence: The Detroit Rioters of 1943,\u201d told the Caller in an email.\n\nMultiple websites have erroneously claimed that the image shows an incident that occurred during the \u201cRed Summer\u201d of 1919. The site Old Magazine Articles previously displayed the image on a page about the 1919 riots, but the site\u2019s editor acknowledged the error and took the image down after being contacted by the Caller.", "lang": "en"}
