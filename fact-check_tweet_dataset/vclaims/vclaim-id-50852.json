Williams that wrongly purports to show Rep. Ilhan Omar \u201cpartying\u201d and \u201ccelebrating\u201d on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The video was actually from a Congressional Black Caucus event on Sept. 13.\n\nThe video posted by Williams, an actor, comedian and conservative commentator, shows Omar laughing and dancing in a crowd to the song \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d by Lizzo.\n\nWilliams claimed in his post that the video shows Omar \u201ccelebrating\u201d and \u201cpartying\u201d on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in three locations: the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Virginia and a plane crash site in Pennsylvania. Williams said it shows Omar is not on \u201cour side.\u201d\n\nTrump retweeted the post, along with his own commentary that Omar will \u201cwin us the Great State of Minnesota,\u201d calling her \u201cThe new face of the Democrat Party!\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 original tweet has since been removed; an archived version is here. It had been viewed more than 650,000 times.\n\nBut Omar\u2019s office told us the event was not on Sept. 11, as Williams claimed. According to Omar\u2019s spokesman, the video was shot at an event called \u201cBreaking Concrete Ceilings\u201d and hosted by freshmen Congressional Black Caucus women on Sept. 13. Here\u2019s a flyer for the event.\n\nThe video of Omar dancing was originally posted by Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. A tweet from BoldProgressives.org confirmed the video was posted by Green from a CBC event on Sept. 13, and called Trump\u2019s tweet \u201can abhorrent lie.\u201d\n\nTwo hours after Trump posted his tweet, Omar responded with one of her own, saying the video was \u201cfrom a CBC event we hosted this weekend to celebrate black women in Congress\u201d and commenting, \u201cThe President of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk.\u201d\n\nTrump is apparently a fan of Williams\u2019 Twitter feed, which often includes pro-Trump messages. The false attack on Omar was one of three tweets that Trump posted on Wednesday morning that either quoted or retweeted Williams.\n\nIn the post about Omar, Williams shows the video of the congresswoman dancing, and then says, \u201cI need to talk to Omar. Girl, what in the world were you celebrating on the anniversary of 9/11? You were seriously partying on the anniversary of 9/11? Turning up, while millions of Americans were at home mourning all the lives that were lost. Over 3,000 people died, and you were out turning up, a congresswoman, partying on the anniversary of 9/11. Are you serious? What were you celebrating? That\u2019s what I want to know. \u2026 We already know why you were celebrating. Yeah, because you believe that some people \u2018did something\u2019 on 9/11. Yeah, you said that. So we know whose side you on, and it\u2019s not our side.\u201d\n\nWilliams also parroted Trump\u2019s tweets on July 14, when the president told Omar and three other progressive Democratic congresswomen known as \u201cthe squad\u201d to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d\n\nIn his post, Williams said, \u201cIf you are not for America, if you don\u2019t like America, you do know that you can always go back home. You do know that you can always get on Delta, American or Southwest and fly your butt back to where you came from.\u201d\n\nOmar\u2019s family fled her native Somalia when she was 8 years old and sought refuge in Kenya before resettling in the U.S. in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1997, according to the Washington Post. She is an American citizen, and became one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018.\n\nOmar has been criticized by some \u2014 including Williams in his tweet \u2014 for comments she made during a 20-minute speech at an annual Council on American-Islamic Relations event in California on March 23. She said that \u201cCAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d We wrote about her fuller comments in our story \u201cRep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s 9/11 Comments in Context.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 11, she tweeted that the 9/11 attack \u201cwas an attack on all of us.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
