Other sources list his birth date as 1753. He served in the Continental Army for one year, discharged mid-December 1777. Heyer bought a farm in Waldoboro after the war, where he lived the rest of his life. When he died in 1856, he was buried with full military honors. After the introduction of the daguerreotype to the United States, Heyer is credited as the earliest-born American to be photographed.\n\nThe image of Heyer was taken when he was 103 years old, according to Smithsonian.", "lang": "en"}
