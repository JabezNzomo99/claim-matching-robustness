We saved it.\"\n\nPants on Fire! Trump has repeatedly misrepresented his administration\u2019s efforts to repeal the Obama-era health care law, which guarantees coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions. Neither Trump nor congressional Republicans who want the courts to strike down the Affordable Care Act have offered a replacement that might maintain its core protections.\n\nWhen Trump said in May 2019 that \"drug prices are coming down,\" we rated that Mostly False. The White House pointed to the Consumer Price Index for drugs, and using one particular time period, there was a small decline.\n\nBut that index leaves out the actual prices people pay, and it only covers retail drugs, about three-fourths of all prescriptions.\n\nBeyond those limitations, the latest numbers for that index show drug prices rising by about 3.9% in December 2019.\n\nOther ways to measure drug prices show that thousands of drugs have seen prices go up, while only about 100 have seen prices fall.\n\n\"For 48 years they've been trying to get Veterans Choice ... One day I say to my people: I have the greatest idea. I am so smart ... We're going to send them down the road to private doctors and we're going to pay the bill and they're going to get fixed.\"\n\nThis ignores that the Veterans Choice program started in 2014. Trump has claimed credit since passage of the Veterans Mission Act in 2018, but the first version of the program was approved four years earlier.\n\nAfter a scandal of long waits for veterans and the efforts of administrators at some facilities to cover that up, Congress and the Obama administration passed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014.\n\nFor veterans who couldn\u2019t be given appointments quickly enough, or who lived more than 40 miles from a Veterans Health Administration hospital, the government would pay for private care.\n\nWhile the initial program was riddled with problems \u2013\u2013 including paying huge overhead fees to the firms managing it \u2013\u2013 it did exactly what Trump described as his own idea. The 2018 Mission Act consolidated several related VA programs and anchored the use of private doctors within the VA system, but the concept was already in place when Trump took office.\n\n\"And today, I had the best polls that I've ever had since being elected, the best we've ever had.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s polling remains stable amid the impeachment trial. A Real Clear Politics average of recent polling shows Trump at a 45.3% approval rating. He last hit that level on Sept. 24, 2019, the day House Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry. Put into context, Trump\u2019s Real Clear Politics average approval has remained between 37% and 45.3% since he was inaugurated.\n\n\"Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10%.\"\n\nThat\u2019s Half True. The people at the bottom end of the wage scale make a lot less than those at the top, but the gains Trump cited are real.\n\nEarnings for the bottom 10% seem to be rising faster, but not by much, and there are different ways to crunch the data.\n\nTrump uses a weekly earnings measure that is favorable to his point but misses a lot of income at the high end. This produces an artificially low estimate for the top 10%. Read our detailed analysis in this fact-check.\n\n\"The money is won. And we are now building that beautiful wall. This powerful border wall is going up at record speed, and we just reached over 100 miles of wall. And next year we\u2019ll be over 400 miles. And shortly thereafter it will be complete.\"\n\nTrump is referring to a court victory allowing him to use $3.6 billion for military construction projects toward the wall instead. (Congress was not giving Trump the money he wanted for the wall, so he declared a national emergency in order to tap the military funds.) Most of the border wall projects replace or bolster existing fencing. As for 400 more miles coming next year, it\u2019s not immediately clear what he\u2019s referring to. He said the same thing in May about 2020. In short, the wall still has a long way to go before it matches Trump\u2019s vision from 2016.\n\n\"But Mexico is in fact, you will soon find out, paying for the wall, okay? \u2026 The wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence of this. We asked the Trump team for more details and haven\u2019t heard back. Trump previously claimed that Mexico would pay for the wall through the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which he will soon sign. There is no provision for the wall in the free trade agreement.", "lang": "en"}
