I left the White House $16 million in debt. But you typically have ignored gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don\u2019t even know this. This was litigated 20 years ago.\"\n\nBut Clinton didn\u2019t have his own facts straight.\n\nLater in the interview, Clinton admitted he never talked to Lewinsky in the aftermath of the affair. He only apologized publicly, and to a long list of people involved.\n\nAs for his claim about leaving the White House with $16 million in debt, that\u2019s an exaggeration.\n\nWe previously looked at a claim by Hillary Clinton that she and Bill came out of the White House \"dead broke.\" A closer look at Clinton\u2019s 2001 financial disclosure form for the Senate shows they possibly had more liabilities than assets, but it doesn\u2019t show that conclusively.\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s claim is different, however. He did not clarify whether he was talking about net or gross debt, or how exactly those debts came to be. He did suggest that the legal fees played an important role.\n\nSo we took another look at Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2001 Senate financial disclosure form, which gives us a public look into hers and her husband\u2019s finances.\n\nHillary Clinton reported that legal debt for the Clintons and former staff members came to a minimum of $1.75 million and maximum of $6.5 million.\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s spokesman, Angel Ure\u00f1a, pointed us to a Washington Post report from 2007 that said the Clintons \"left the White House with an estimated $12 million in legal debts rung up during the Whitewater, campaign fundraising and Monica S. Lewinsky investigations.\"\n\nSeveral news reports echoed a similar estimate of legal costs, but we were unable to track down the source of that amount.\n\nThe burden of legal costs didn\u2019t entirely fall on the Clintons. Established in 1998, the Presidential Legal Expense Trust defrayed personal legal expenses through donations from U.S. citizens (government employees or registered lobbyists were not allowed). That was the second trust set up to pay off the Clintons\u2019 legal expenses.\n\nIn July 2001, The New Yorker reported the fund raised $8.8 million. \"Even after expenses, that covered much of the eleven or twelve million dollars in legal fees that the Clintons have incurred so far,\" the report reads. (Clinton left the White House in January 2001.)\n\nThat legal debt was gone by 2004, according to Hillary Clinton\u2019s financial disclosure form.\n\nJeff Hoopes, an accounting professor at University of North Carolina, told us there were numbers that may not have made it into the disclosure form, such as mortgages or loans from relatives.\n\nMortgages could realistically have added a burden. In 1999, the Clintons bought a five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y., for $1.7 million. In December 2000, just as they were leaving the White House, they bought a seven-bedroom house near Embassy Row in Washington for $2.85 million.\n\nCitibank lent the Clintons $1.995 million to buy the Washington house.\n\nHoopes emphasized that whatever the value of debt, the Clintons were unambiguously not suffering financially after leaving office.\n\n\"They had a huge amount of earnings potential, and to keep suggesting they were suffering financially is disingenuous,\" Hoopes said.\n\nHoopes\u2019 point: The Clintons may have taken on debt but had a clear path to getting out of the red. And they sure did.\n\nForbes, using Hillary Clinton\u2019s tax returns, estimated the Clintons earned more than $240 million from 2001-15.\n\nClinton said he \"left the White House $16 million in debt.\"\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s 2000 Senate financial disclosure form shows a debt of anywhere between $1.75 million and maximum of $6.5 million. Bill Clinton\u2019s spokesman said the Clintons\u2019 legal fees reached $12 million, but a large portion of that was covered by a legal defense fund.\n\nWe rate this Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
