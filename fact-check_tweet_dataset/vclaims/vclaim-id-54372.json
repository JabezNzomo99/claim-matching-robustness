The $2 trillion CARES Act most notably provided financial support in the form of $1,200 checks to qualifying individuals and dedicated $376 billion for small business relief.\n\nHigh unemployment rates and the July 31 expiration of the $600-per-week unemployment payments authorized by the CARES Act have prompted Congress to consider another stimulus package.\n\nOn May 15, the House passed a $3 trillion Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions, or HEROES Act, which would distribute another round of federal stimulus checks of up to $1,200 to individuals and, among other measures, would expand the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses.\n\nHowever, members of the Senate, who returned from recess on July 20, have indicated they will not pass the HEROES Act. Instead, they plan to propose their own stimulus package in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Senate hopes to keep the cost in the $1 trillion range, which will limit the scope of the bill.\n\nBut before Congress has agreed on the elements of another economic support package, a new iteration of an old prank post is circulating on Facebook, falsely suggesting that a second round of federal stimulus payments is imminent.\n\nThe new post reads, \u201cEveryone including essential workers will be compensated $1,000. The money will be available to u in 5-7 business days. Thank me later. Click the link to sign up.\u201d\n\nWhen the link provided is clicked, up pops an image of a gorilla making an obscene gesture.\n\nVersions of the post use the logos of the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA \u2013 neither of which would be responsible for a second stimulus payment, we should note.\n\nAnother version of the bogus post show images of a check from the Treasury and the U.S. Capitol, and claims: \u201cAnd it passed[.] WE GET ANOTHER STIMULUS CHECK FOR $2000 on August 10, 2020[.] Everyone including ESSENTIAL WORKERS will be compensated $2000[.] The money will be available to you in 5-7 business days.\u201d\n\nBut the amount of any additional stimulus checks, who would be eligible, and when any payments would be made have not been determined.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
