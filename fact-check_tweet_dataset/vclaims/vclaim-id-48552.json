The post also says that Savarkar was born in 1883. By mentioning Savarkar\u2019s birth year, the post claims that Amit Shah has commented that Veer Savarkar participated in the 1857 revolt. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post \n\n\n\nClaim: Amit Shah has said that Veer Savarkar participated in the 1857 revolt. Fact: In a speech at Varanasi, Amit Shah said, \u201cHad it not been for Veer Savarkar, the rebellion of 1857 would not have become history, we would have seen it from the point of view of Britishers. Veer Savarkar was the one who named the 1857 rebellion as the first independence struggle\u201d. Amit Shah has not said in his speech that Savarkar participated in the 1857 revolt. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nThe photo in the post was taken from the \u2018India Today\u2019s article. So when we looked into the article, it was found that Amit Shah has said in a speech at Varanasi that \u201cwithout Veer Savarkar, revolt of 1857 wouldn\u2019t become historic\u201d. It was nowhere written in the article that Amit Shah has said that Savarkar participated in the 1857 revolt. The same information was also found in a tweet made by ANI channel: \u201cHad it not been for Veer Savarkar, the rebellion of 1857 would not have become history, we would have seen it from the point of view of Britishers. Veer Savarkar was the one who named the 1857 rebellion as the first independence struggle\u201d. Also, when a video related to his speech is seen carefully, the same information mentioned in the tweet was found\n\nLastly, Amit Shah did not comment in his speech that Veer Savarkar participated in the 1857 revolt.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
