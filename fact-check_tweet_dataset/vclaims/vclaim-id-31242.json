Republicans have called the letter a \u201cthreat\u201d to withhold support for aid to Ukraine, saying it\u2019s similar to what critics have charged Trump did.\n\nThere\u2019s no explicit \u201cthreat\u201d to take any actions in the letter. Whether there\u2019s an implied threat involving U.S. support of Ukraine is a matter of opinion, but politicians have gone too far in claiming the Democratic letter is \u201cthe same kind of stuff they\u2019re accusing Trump of,\u201d in the words of Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nRepublicans have adopted this talking point to counter Democratic accusations that Trump withheld military assistance to Ukraine to pressure the country into investigating Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and allegations that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. There are key differences between the Democratic letter and Trump\u2019s actions:\n\u2022 The Democratic letter did not mention U.S. aid to Ukraine but described support for Ukraine building \u201cdemocratic institutions.\u201d Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July call that \u201cwe do a lot for Ukraine,\u201d but it\u2019s not necessarily \u201creciprocal,\u201d according to a White House memo of the call. Trump then asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election.\n\u2022 The Democrats took no action to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine; Trump admitted that he placed a hold on security assistance to Ukraine the month of the phone call. The situation alarmed the charge d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine who expressed concern that security assistance was contingent on Trump\u2019s requests for investigations.\n\u2022 The Democratic senators wrote to ask about reports of Ukraine not cooperating with an existing U.S. investigation; Trump was asking Ukraine to open investigations involving a political rival and the 2016 election.\n\nPaul, a Republican senator from Kentucky, used the GOP talking point during an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Oct. 13. \u201cWell, here\u2019s the thing is if you\u2019re going to condemn Trump you need to condemn the Democrat senators. It shouldn\u2019t be just one-sided,\u201d Paul said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going after President Trump. Someone needs to actually, in an objective way, evaluate a letter from four Democrats that said to Ukraine, \u2018If you don\u2019t keep investigating Trump we will reconsider our bipartisan support for aid.\u2019 That\u2019s a threat. And that\u2019s the same kind of stuff they\u2019re accusing Trump of.\u201d\n\nTrump himself referred to the letter in a Sept. 25 press conference. \u201cAnd it got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durbin and Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were \u2018critical,'\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn\u2019t do the right thing, they wouldn\u2019t get any assistance. Gee, doesn\u2019t that sound familiar?\u201d\n\nAnd Sen. Lindsey Graham mentioned the letter the same day in an interview on Fox News: \u201cThere was a letter sent by Democratic senators in May 2018 threatening the Ukraine to cut off aid if they did not investigate Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump gets it right when he says the Democratic senators were \u201cexpressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were \u2018critical,'\u201d \u2014 wording that comes from a Washington Post opinion column \u2014 but the senators didn\u2019t ask Ukraine to \u201cinvestigate Trump\u201d or threaten to \u201ccut off aid,\u201d as Graham said. The senators \u2014 Menendez, Durbin and Leahy \u2014 were asking about a New York Times report on May 2, 2018, that Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, had \u201ceffectively frozen\u201d four cases involving work done by Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, for former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nThe May 4, 2018, letter says the Times reported that Lutsenko had frozen the investigations out of a concern of losing U.S. aid.\n\nThe Times reported that a special prosecutor, Serhiy Horbatyuk, was barred from issuing subpoenas in the cases and talking to witnesses. Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament and an ally of then-President Petro Poroshenko, \u201creadily acknowledged that the intention in Kiev was to put investigations into Mr. Manafort\u2019s activities \u2018in the long-term box,'\u201d the Times said.\n\n\u201cIn every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials,\u201d Ariev told the newspaper. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t spoil relations with the administration.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Manafort, who had worked for pro-Russia political figures in Ukraine, was facing money-laundering and tax fraud charges as part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election to aid Trump and whether there was coordination with the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Times reported: \u201cThe decision to halt the investigations by an anticorruption prosecutor was handed down at a delicate moment for Ukraine, as the Trump administration was finalizing plans to sell the country sophisticated anti-tank missiles, called Javelins.\u201d\n\nTwo days after the Times report, the Democratic senators wrote to Lutsenko, asking if the report was correct and whether \u201cany individual from the Trump Administration, or anyone acting on its behalf\u201d encouraged the Ukrainian government \u201cnot to cooperate\u201d with the Mueller investigation.\n\nPaul\u2019s office told us the senator was referring to \u201cthe entire first paragraph and beyond\u201d in the letter, so we\u2019ll include the full first paragraph here:\n\nLetter from Sens. Menendez, Durbin and Leahy to Lutsenko, May 4, 2018: We are writing to express great concern about reports that your office has taken steps to impede cooperation with the investigation of United States Special counsel Robert Mueller. As strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine, we believe that our cooperation should extend to such legal matters, regardless of politics. Ours is a relationship built on a foundation of respect for the rule of law and accountable democratic institutions. In four short years, Ukraine has made significant progress in building these institutions despite ongoing military, economic and political pressure from Moscow. We have supported that capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these principles in order to avoid the ire of President Trump. If these reports are true, we strongly encourage you to reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.\n\nMarc Thiessen, a conservative columnist for the Washington Post, wrote on Sept. 24 that the letter carried the suggestion that the senators\u2019 support for assistance to Ukraine was on the line. \u201cIn the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Aug. 22, 2018, the Times reported that Lutsenko \u201chas denied any relation between the [Manafort] investigation\u2019s suspension and potential concerns about antagonizing President Trump.\u201d Lutsenko had announced on Aug. 21, the day Manafort was convicted on several charges in the U.S., an investigation into former Ukrainian officials who had paid Manafort.\n\nA joint statement issued by Menendez, Durbin and Leahy on Sept. 25 said the \u201cletter in no way calls for the conditioning of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWhether the senators were making an implied threat that aid to Ukraine was at stake if Lutsenko didn\u2019t reopen the investigations is matter of opinion. But the Republican politicians go too far when they claim a threat was made, and they don\u2019t tell the whole story about the letter. The Democratic senators\u2019 concern was about Ukraine halting investigations due to a fear that Trump would be the one cutting off aid.\n\nCorrection, Oct. 24: We originally misspelled columnist Marc Thiessen\u2019s name.
