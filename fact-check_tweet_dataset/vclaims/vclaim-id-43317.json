New York City has become the epicenter of the U.S.\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, with 25,573 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 366 deaths as of Friday morning.\n\nThe footage, however, actually comes from a video uploaded on YouTube in December 2014 by the YouTube account THEMAJESTIRIUM1. The video\u2019s description reads, \u201cHere you will see a United States Armed Forces mini convoy leaving after participating in the Veterans Day Parade in the Midtown area of Manhattan in New York City.\u201d\n\nNew York City\u2019s Veterans Day Parade took place on Nov. 11 that year. Joseph Ramos, the New York-based videographer who runs the YouTube account, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that he took the video at that parade in 2014.\n\nWhile the video showing armored military vehicles isn\u2019t recent, soldiers have been deployed to New York City amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Army\u2019s 531st Hospital from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and the 9th Hospital from Fort Hood, Texas, will set up over the weekend to start treating non-coronavirus patients in the city on Monday, according to Stars and Stripes.", "lang": "en"}
