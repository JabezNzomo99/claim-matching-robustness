No, that's not true: The full video clearly shows that Trump was walking away from the reporters toward where he would join hands with first lady Melania Trump, and then they would board Marine One together. The viral video clip ends before the first lady enters the frame, causing it to look like Trump got lost and confused while attempting to board the presidential helicopter, which was only a few feet away.\n\nThe claim originated from a tweet (archived here) posted on September 7, 2020. The caption read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Twitter at the time of writing:\n\nIn the full video, viewers can see that the first lady enters the screen at 12:03, whereas the viral video clip ends a few seconds before the 12-minute mark.\n\nThere have been no reports that the president is suffering from \"frontotemporal dementia\" as the tweet claims. The tweet cites no source for its claim.", "lang": "en"}
