And he wants to become the Prime Minister.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral picture has been inverted laterally. Rahul Gandhi did not salute with his left hand in the original photo taken almost nine years ago.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the post was already shared almost 600 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found that the original image was published on several news websites in 2011. NDTVand Zee News had published this image on August 15, 2011.\n\nWe also found the picture on the Getty Images website. The caption reads, AICC General Secretary Rahul Gandhi during the 65th Independence Day celebrations at the party headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nAs per the Ministry of Defence guideline about ceremonial salutes for the armed forces, it is mentioned that Salutes will be given with the right hand. Where from physical incapacity a right hand salute is impossible the salute is to be given with the left hand.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that a nine-year-old photo of Rahul Gandhi saluting the Tricolour with his right hand has been inverted laterally to show as if he was using his left hand.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Truth behind mother fox feeding koalas during Australia bushfires\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Irfan Pathan was meeting fans in Kolkata, not protesters at Shaheen Bagh", "lang": "en"}
