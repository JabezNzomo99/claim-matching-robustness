An aide has said that Biden doesn\u2019t remember her.\n\nBut images being shared on social media suggest that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee ought to remember her.\n\n\"This is Tara Reade,\" says the text above a photo published on Twitter of a younger Biden standing next to a smiling, brown-haired woman, with his hand on her arm (the other hand is not visible). \"The woman he never met. He knows her well enough to \u2026 have one hand on her butt and appears to be at ease firmly against her like family.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden says he can\u2019t remember Tara Reade,\" reads another tweet showing the photo. \"Perhaps this will help refresh his memory.\"\n\nThe tweets were flagged by VineSight, an organization that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation, and they also appear on Facebook.\n\nThe photo was taken by Associated Press photographer Ron Edmonds in January 1993, when Reade worked for Biden. However, the woman in the picture is Zoe Baird, whom then-President Bill Clinton had nominated for attorney general.\n\nThe AP photo caption says: \"Attorney General-designate Zoe Baird meets with Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Biden will chair the committee during Baird\u2019s confirmation hearings.\"\n\nBaird ultimately withdrew her nomination after losing support because she hired two undocumented immigrants to help take care of her child.\n\nPolitico reported that Biden told the White House Baird was \"dead-on-arrival after failing to pay Social Security taxes on her nanny.\"\n\nWe rate these tweets about the photo False.", "lang": "en"}
