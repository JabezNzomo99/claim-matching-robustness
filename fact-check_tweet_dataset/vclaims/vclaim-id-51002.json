BOOM spoke to the organisers of the event and found social media posts of the same poster from earlier in the week which do not mention a dress code at all, proving that the viral image is doctored.\n\n\n\nEarlier on Friday, several right wing Twitter handles started tweeting an image of a poster for an anti-CAA rally claiming that the organisers of the 'Massive Women's Protest' in Mumbai have specified the dress code as a hijab or burqa.\n\nThe fake image gained currency among growing criticism from the Hindutva right wing that Muslims in India are leading protests against the Act.\n\nThe doctored image was shared by Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Umrao Patel, a Delhi based lawyer, who tweeted the photoshopped poster with the caption, \"The Protest is against CAA but the dress code is hijab and burqa. Freedom from patriarchy and manuwad will be attained by wearing hijab and burqa. Simply put, this is not a movement across the country, but a show of strength and the patience of the Hindus of the country is being tested.\"\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nThis is not the first time Patel has made claims that have been later found to be blatantly false or misleading.

The flyer shared is not the right one,\" Advocate Zubair Azmi told BOOM.\n\n\n\nAzmi sent us the original flyer which confirms that the viral flyer is photoshooped. In the original flyer one can spot that the sentence, \"Dress code for women: Hijab or Burqa\" is not present.\n\nThe added text on the photoshopped flyer is in upper case, whereas in the original flyer lower case and the shade of yellow in the sentence does not match.\n\nAdditionally, we found social media posts with the original flyer days before the protest that confirm that the original poster did not include any instructions about a dress code. In this Facebook post by Aamir Edresy, one of the organisers, one can spot it includes no dress code for women.\n\nThe original flyer can also be spotted in this tweet posted on January 16, 2020, which is on the tweet thread on Anti-CAA protests scheduled in the country.\n\nBOOM also managed to source images from the protest on Friday evening, we found that there were woman who were not wearing a Hijab or a Burqa.", "lang": "en"}
