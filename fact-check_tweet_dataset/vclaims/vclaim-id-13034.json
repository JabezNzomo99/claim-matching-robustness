In fact, all eight of the state\u2019s rating areas have at least one carrier and three of them have two carriers.\n\nTrump met at the White House with a group of House members on March 17 to discuss the American Health Care Act. With the House members seated with him in the Oval Office, Trump discussed his recent visit to Tennessee and the state of its health care system.\n\nTennessee divides the state into eight rating areas. Three of the eight \u2014 the East, Greater Nashville and Greater Memphis areas \u2014 have two carriers selling health insurance on the federal marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act, according to the state\u2019s 2017 rating area plans and rates. The other five rating areas have only one carrier.\n\nIt is important that at least one company is selling insurance on the marketplace in each rating area, because the federal government provides tax credits and subsidies to help pay for insurance only for those who purchase plans on the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nInsurance carriers in the ACA marketplace offer multiple plans \u2014 such as bronze, silver and gold \u2014 which offer different levels of coverage at different prices. And a company may offer more than one of each level. For example, Cigna sells three bronze plans, four silver plans and one gold plan in Greater Nashville, according to the state\u2019s rating plan.\n\nWe confirmed with the state Department of Commerce and Insurance that no rating area in the state is without at least one health insurance company on the ACA marketplace. \u201cThe rating areas brochure is still correct,\u201d Kevin Walters, a department spokesman, told us in an email.\n\nWalters did say, however, that it is possible that some parts of the state will be without marketplace coverage next year.\n\nHumana announced last month that it will no longer sell insurance on the ACA marketplace. \u201cHumana is currently the only insurer on the exchange in the greater Knoxville area \u2014 meaning if another insurance company does not enter the market, there will be no Obamacare exchange in that area,\u201d the Tennessean wrote.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that a carrier will offer coverage for that area in 2018, but so far there has been no replacement,\u201d Walters said, adding that without a replacement there would be 79,000 residents in the state without access to a marketplace insurance plan. There were more than 234,000 ACA plans selected in Tennessee during enrollment period that ended Jan. 31, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIt may be that some in Tennessee will be without a marketplace insurance plan next year, but Trump is wrong to say that \u201chalf of the state has no insurance company and the other half is gonna lose the insurance company.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
