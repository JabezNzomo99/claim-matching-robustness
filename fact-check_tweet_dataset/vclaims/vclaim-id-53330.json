Titled \u201cJapan will finally abandon microwave ovens by 2020,\u201d the article contains the same information that was spread on Facebook. However, at the bottom of the article was a disclaimer saying: \u201cSatirical edition \u2018Panorama.\u2019 All texts on this web resource are grotesque parodies of reality and are not real news.\u201d\n\nUsing reverse image search, we also found that the photo used in the Russian satirical article, which was also carried by some of the Facebook posts, was a photo from Getty Images.\n\nMoreover, a search of \u201cmicrowave ovens\u201d on the Japanese government\u2019s official website yielded no mention of the supposed ban, as pointed out earlier by Agence France-Presse. This is also the case for the official website of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.\n\nIn 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) released an information sheet on electromagnetic fields and public health concerning microwave ovens. The organization clarified that the design of microwave ovens ensures that the microwaves are contained within the appliance.\n\n\u201cTo dispel some misconceptions, it is important to realize that food cooked in a microwave oven does not become \u2018radioactive.\u2019 Nor does any microwave energy remain in the cavity or the food after the microwave oven is switched off. In this respect, microwaves act just like light; when the light bulb is turned off, no light remains,\u201d WHO said. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
