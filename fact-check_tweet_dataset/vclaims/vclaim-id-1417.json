It\u2019s at 4.1% where it\u2019s 4.9% across the rest [of the UK].\u201d\n\nIn Wales the unemployment rate was 4.1% between May and July 2016. This means that around 63,000 people between 16 and 64, who were available for or seeking work, did not have jobs.\n\nThis is a decrease of around 35,000 people and 2.3% since the same time last year.\n\nUnemployment across the whole of the UK is at 4.9%. This means that 1.63 million people were unemployed.\n\nWales does have the lowest unemployment rate of any of the four nations of the UK. Northern Ireland had the highest with 5.6% unemployment.\n\nThe only regions of the country with a lower unemployment rate than Wales are the East and South East of England. The highest rates of unemployment were found in the North East, the West Midlands and London.", "lang": "en"}
