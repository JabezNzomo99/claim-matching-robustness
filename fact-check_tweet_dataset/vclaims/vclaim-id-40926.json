Rolando Bautista said 80 percent of the 18 million poorest households in the country have received the government\u2019s social amelioration aid amid the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPublished in FB group OFFICIAL LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT Rodrigo Roa DUTERTE , the post featured a screengrab of what appears to be an Instagram Story or FB My Day post showing a Philippine Information Agency file photo of Bautista, superimposed with a statement he supposedly made on April 2: \u201cWe are happy to report that 80% of the 18 million households in the country had already received their Social Amelioration Benefits.\u201d\n\nAlso in the screengrab was a strongly-worded reaction, placed above the quote card, that says the aid has not yet been \u201cseen nor felt\u201d by its beneficiaries.\n\nThe quote card is fake.\n\nBautista made no such statement during the hour-and-a-half-long Laging Handa online press briefing on April 2.\n\nWhat he reported was that DSWD has already received an initial P100 billion pesos intended for distribution to the country's poorest households estimated at 18 million. Each family will receive from P5,000 to P8,000 under the government's social amelioration program to support their needs during the emergency.\n\nIn an interview with DZMM Teleradyo on April 15, DSWD USec. Camilo Gudmalin said that as of noon that day four million out of 18 million intended beneficiaries, roughly around 22 percent, have received social amelioration aid amounting to P18 billion.\n\nThe fabricated quote card was posted three days after the press briefing, and continues to circulate more than a week after its publication.\n\nThe Facebook post has since obtained over 2,500 shares, more than 900 reactions and over 800 comments from netizens, many of whom wrote down their areas of residence and said they haven\u2019t received any aid yet.", "lang": "en"}
