Ron DeSantis and his administration have provided mixed messages about schools amid soaring COVID-19 cases, calling for them to reopen in August but also offer an online education option.\n\nBut DeSantis has been consistent in his assurance that schoolchildren aren\u2019t spreading the virus to adults.\n\n\"I think it has been found over and over again, as people have looked at this and studied this, particularly in Europe, that the schoolchildren actually aren\u2019t vectors for this,\" DeSantis said at a news conference July 11. \"For whatever reason they usually get infected by the parents, they usually aren\u2019t infecting adults. Places that have had schools open have not seen the schools contribute to increasing the prevalence of the virus.\"\n\nDays later, he made a similar statement in a roundtable with mayors in Miami-Dade County.\n\nDeSantis presented his case as settled science, but we found that there isn\u2019t enough evidence to reach that conclusion yet. Since research is limited, we won\u2019t yet put his statement on our Truth-O-Meter.\n\nSome research from other countries suggests that schoolchildren may not be the drivers of virus transmission. Children account for far fewer confirmed COVID-19 cases than adults, and are less likely to develop complications.\n\nBut much of the research involves small numbers, and some has not yet been peer-reviewed. And the data is limited because schools worldwide were largely shut down starting early in the pandemic.\n\n\"There aren\u2019t a lot of kids who have had a normal day in the past four months,\" John Brownstein, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, told ABC News.\n\nResearch is largely from outside the U.S.\n\nChildren appear to be less likely to transmit than adults, \"although the science isn\u2019t completely settled on that,\" said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Committee on Infectious Diseases. \"But to say children don\u2019t transmit at all is wrong.\"\n\nDeSantis\u2019 office did not respond to our request for evidence for his contention that children are not vectors for the virus. But a July commentary published in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics supported parts of his claim.\n\nThe authors, pediatric infectious-disease specialists at the University of Vermont, based their conclusions on studies in Switzerland, China, France and Australia. One author, William Raszka, told us some of the studies had been peer-reviewed or were published by government offices.\n\nHis paper cited a study published in Pediatrics that looked at 39 infected children in Switzerland and found only three cases where the child developed symptoms before others in the household. However the authors noted limitations including that the study sample likely does not broadly represent pediatric cases during this time period.\n\nArnaud L\u2019Huillier, one of the authors of the study, told PolitiFact that children can emit live viruses, so there is no biological reason why they couldn\u2019t be contagious.\n\nBut the dynamics of the virus vary by age.\n\n\"Children much less frequently transmit SARS-CoV-2 than adults, and this is most striking in younger children,\" Raszka said. \"I worry more about high school students.\"\n\nHow strong is the case for reopening schools?\n\nA National Institutes of Health study will follow 2,000 families for six months to determine in part how often children get infected and then infect their families. For now, U.S. health officials have discussed a lack of data on children and COVID-19 transmission.\n\n\"We don't really know exactly what the efficiency of spread is, first of all how many children get infected,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious-disease specialist, said at a Senate hearing June 30. \"But if the rate of infection is down and they don't readily transmit to their parents and family members, that's going to be very important in the decision-making process of opening schools,\" he said.\n\nFauci warned that the U.S. isn\u2019t comparable with countries in Europe that shut down more completely.\n\nRELATED: Tucker Carlson claims coronavirus \u2018poses virtually zero threat\u2019 to children, most teachers\n\nFlorida officials like DeSantis nonetheless cite Europe\u2019s experience to back their push for reopening schools.\n\nFlorida\u2019s education commissioner tweeted an article about the first phase of a study in Germany. It concluded that reopened schools did not become hotspots. The study by the University Hospital Dresden of 2,000 children and teachers at a school found few COVID-19 antibodies among them. Reinhard Berner, a professor of pediatrics at the hospital, said that the study was representative for the German state of Saxony, which has a relatively low rate of infection.\n\nSome European countries did have success in reopening schools, but most didn\u2019t reopen school amid a spike of outbreaks like the one Florida and some other states are experiencing now.\n\nBy contrast, Israel reopened schools in May, and within weeks hundreds of students and staff tested positive for the disease. Israel did not coordinate removing lockdown restrictions for schools and public gatherings, said Nadav Davidovitch, director of Ben-Gurion University\u2019s school of public health\u200b.\n\n\"Our experience in Israel is that children are less infected, less infecting and their illness is usually milder, but we had clusters and very rarely also more severe cases,\" Davidovitch told PolitiFact.\n\nOther experts warn that the public should not read too much into the fact that fewer children than adults have contracted the virus.\n\n\"For example, it is possible that the impact on children was limited because they were sheltered during the height of community disease,\" said Marissa J. Levine, a University of South Florida public health professor. \"I hope that doesn\u2019t change when schools are opened up but, in effect, school opening under these conditions would be an experiment for which we would not know the answers until after the fact.\"", "lang": "en"}
