KwaZulu-Natal has a lower murder rate than both the Eastern and Western Cape provinces.\n\u2022 None Inanda police station recorded the highest number of reported rapes in 2019/20. Crime rates for police precincts can be difficult to calculate, as they don\u2019t always line up with census boundaries. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe police released South Africa\u2019s crime statistics for 2019/20 on\n\n\u201cwe are not where we wanted to be\u201d but that he was \u201cpleased with the improvements in more stubborn crime categories\u201d.\n\nThe media covered the statistics widely, with many\n\ndown to provincial and local level.\n\nprovince was the murder capital of South Africa. It also said\n\n, a large township in the province, was the country\u2019s rape capital.\n\nDo the statistics support these claims? We checked.\n\nkilling of another person. According to the\n\n, a South African policy think tank, murder statistics are considered the\n\nbecause they can be independently verified.\n\nin KwaZulu-Natal. This was more than in any other province and a 10.6% increase on the previous year\u2019s figure of 4,395.\n\nWhen Cele was asked the reason for the increase, he\n\nthe province\u2019s Inanda and Umlazi townships as \u201cproblematic areas\u201d.\n\nBut do the figures make KwaZulu-Natal the murder capital of the country?\n\n\u201cThe total number of murders tell us little about the risk of victimisation, or the frequency of the violence,\u201d Dr Andrew Faull, senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, told Africa Check.\n\nFor example, in 2012, nearly\n\nmurders were recorded in the United States. South Africa recorded about\n\n\u201cSome people may look at these figures and assume that the two countries are equally dangerous or violent. But if we consider this data in relation to the two countries' populations in 2012, we see that the US has six times as many people as South Africa,\u201d Faull said.\n\nThis suggests that people in South Africa were six times more likely to be murdered than people in the US, even though both countries recorded roughly the same number of murders.\n\n\u201cThis is why we should always strive for murder \u2013 and other crime \u2013 rates rather than counts.\u201d\n\nKwaZulu-Natal\u2019s murder rate was 42.6 for every 100,000 people in 2019/20. But the Eastern Cape, which recorded\n\nmurders, had a higher murder rate of 59.5 per 100,000 people. The Western Cape province followed closely behind with a murder rate of 58.2.\n\nDoes this make the Eastern Cape province the murder capital of the country?\n\nIt\u2019s definitely worth highlighting the parts of the country that seem to be the most violent, Faull said, but it\u2019s not necessarily helpful to single out an entire province as a \u201ccapital\u201d.\n\n\u201cA province is far too big for localised interventions.\u201d Ideally, we should look at murder rates at police station level and identify the places and times when murder usually occurs, Faull said.\n\ncases, more than any other police station in the country. The Umlazi police station recorded 293 cases.\n\nBut as with the previous claim about murder, total numbers alone are not useful. If the numbers were converted into a rape rate, it might provide a clearer indication of high risk areas, Lisa Vetten, gender-based violence researcher, told Africa Check.\n\nBut, to do this, you would need to know how many people live in each police precinct. Unfortunately, precincts don\u2019t always line up with census boundaries, making it difficult to calculate a rape rate for the areas they serve.\n\n\u201cAnd even if you were able to calculate the rape rate for Inanda, you would need to carry out that exercise throughout the country in order to see whether it remains the so-called rape capital,\u201d Vetten said.\n\nThere is also the issue of\n\n. It\u2019s well known that the rape statistics collected by the police are not an accurate reflection of the actual number of rapes that take place. \u201cAt best, all you are comparing is the extent to which any one population, group or area is willing to report versus another,\u201d Vetten said.\n\nSo while claims about rape capitals may potentially draw our attention to a particular problem, they don\u2019t help us understand the problem or how to address it.\n\n\u201cThere is value, however, in trying to understand geographical variations in the distribution of rape,\u201d Vetten said. \u201cBecause when you look at the provincial breakdown, it\u2019s very clear that there are variations across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tells us that rape does not occur identically. It pushes us to ask more nuanced questions about why rape may be lower here than there.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
