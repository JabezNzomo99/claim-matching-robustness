The reference to the State Department is more obscure, but it may refer to contacts between two State Department officials and Christopher Steele, a former British spy who wrote the \u201cdossier\u201d that alleged connections between Trump and Russia.\n\nFirst, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was appointed because Trump fired Comey and then went on television and suggested that it was because of the Russia probe. That left the Justice Department little choice but to appoint an independent prosecutor. (Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, so the decision was made by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.) Mueller\u2019s investigation has yielded concrete evidence of Russian interference, including the indictments of Russian individuals and entities.\n\nSecond, the investigation did not start with the dossier written by Steele. (Steele was working for political research firm Fusion GPS, which has a contract with a law firm that worked for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.) Instead, it was a tip from the Australian government, which notified U.S. authorities about a drunken conversation between a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, and an Australian diplomat in May.\n\nPapadopoulos claimed the Russians had \u201cpolitical dirt\u201d on Clinton. The memo released by the Republican majority of the House Intelligence Committee, which Trump has approvingly cited, confirms the counterintelligence investigation of Russian interference began in July 2016, because of the tip about Papadopoulos. The information in the dossier came to the attention of the FBI later.\n\nThird, there is no evidence the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application to monitor Carter Page was used to spy on the Trump campaign. On Sept. 26, 2016, Page announced that he was taking \u201ca leave of absence\u201d from the campaign. On Oct. 21, the FBI received a FISA court order to begin surveillance on Page. So that was just days before the election \u2014 and after Page was no longer part of the campaign.\n\nThis tweet is prompted by a passage in McCabe\u2019s statement defending himself against charges of unauthorized leaking about the Clinton investigation: \u201cI chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As deputy director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter.\u201d\n\nWhether Comey\u2019s answer was untruthful may turn on the question of authorization. McCabe asserts that he had the authority to have the conversation with the reporter and that Comey was \u201caware of the interaction.\u201d But he does not say Comey authorized the conversation \u2014 and Grassley did not ask whether Comey was aware of anyone in the FBI acting as an anonymous source.\n\nJust because McCabe supposedly did not take notes, he still could have summarized the conversations for a memo immediately after the conversation. Comey had a practice of emailing his summary to a few close aides, thus creating a record and time stamp. The time between the conversation and the record of it would be an important part of establishing the memo\u2019s credibility.", "lang": "en"}
