While his friend watched, she told The Washington Post, \u201cKavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.\u201d She eventually escaped from the room when the friend, identified as Mark Judge, jumped on them and then tumbled on the floor. She said she did not tell anyone about the attack at the time. Her lawyers released a copy of a polygraph exam she took Aug. 7 that indicated that she was not being deceptive.\n\nRussell Ford: Her husband since 2002, he said in an affidavit that he learned around the time of their wedding that she had been the victim of sexual assault. In 2012, during couples\u2019 therapy, she revealed that she had been \u201ctrapped in a room and physically restrained by one boy who was molesting her while another boy watched. \u2026 I remember her saying that the attacker\u2019s name was Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d (Ford provided The Post with therapist notes from the couples' therapy in which she reported that she was attacked by students \u201cfrom an elitist boys\u2019 school\u201d who went on to become \u201chighly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.\u201d)\n\nAdela Gildo-Mazzon, a friend. In an affidavit, she said that during a meal in June 2013, Ford, \u201cvisibly upset,\u201d told her that she had been \u201calmost raped by someone who was now a federal judge. She told me she had been trapped in a room with two drunken guys, and that she then escaped.\u201d\n\nReaction: Kavanaugh \u201ccategorically and unequivocally\u201d denied he ever was involved in such an assault. He released his calendar for the summer of 1982 to indicate that he had attended no such small gathering. Other people that Ford named as being present at the party, including Judge, said they had no recollection of any such party or such an attack.\n\nHer allegation: She told the New Yorker that 35 years ago at Yale University, \u201cKavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away.\u201d She said she had drunk a fair amount of alcohol but remembered a male student shouting, \u201cBrett Kavanaugh just put his penis in Debbie\u2019s face.\u201d She said she had remained silent about the incident for many years because she blamed herself for drinking too much.\n\nCorroborators: None publicly identified. The New Yorker and the New York Times could not confirm with any eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party. An unidentified classmate said he is \u201c100 percent sure\u201d he was told at the time that Kavanaugh was the student who exposed himself to Ramirez. \u201cThe story stayed with him, he said, because it was disturbing and seemed outside the bounds of typically acceptable behavior, even during heavy drinking at parties on campus,\u201d the New Yorker reported.\n\nHer allegation: In a sworn declaration, she said that in 1981-1983, she observed Kavanaugh drinking excessively at house parties and engaging \u201cin abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls.\u201d She claimed Kavanaugh and others would get girls inebriated so they could be \u201cgang raped\u201d in side rooms at house parties by a \u201ctrain\u201d of numerous boys. \u201cI have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their \u2018turn\u2019 with a girl inside the room. These boys included Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d She added that in 1982, she was a victim of a \u201cgang rape\u201d at which Kavanaugh was present. But she did not say he participated in it and provided no details about where the alleged rape took place.\n\nPossible related allegation: Elizabeth Rasor, a former girlfriend of Judge at Catholic University, said that Judge told her about an incident in which he and other boys took turns having sex with a drunk woman. \u201cRasor said that Judge seemed to regard it as fully consensual,\u201d the New Yorker reported. \u201cShe said that Judge did not name others involved in the incident, and she has no knowledge that Kavanaugh participated.\u201d Judge categorically denies her account. Rasor has told the Judiciary Committee that she would be willing to talk to the FBI about the incident.", "lang": "en"}
