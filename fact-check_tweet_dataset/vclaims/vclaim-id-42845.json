The claim alongside the post states that the man shown in the picture has added his HIV-infected blood to Pepsi. Also, the post warns people not to consume Pepsi for the next few weeks. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral claim is false. Neither the man shown in the post is a worker from Pepsi nor the claim related to the HIV-contaminated Pepsi is true.\n\nThe post shared on Facebook reads: \u201cThis is the guy who added his infected blood to Pepsi. For the next few weeks do not drink any products from Pepsi, as a worker from the company has added his blood contaminated with HIV(AIDS). Brothers and sisters please this message to the people who u care.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News investigated by searching the image of the man used in the viral post using Google Reverse Image tool.\n\nThe picture of the man featured in the post was that of Aminu Sadiq Ogwuche. He was the alleged mastermind of the Nyanya bomb attack in Nigeria\u2019s Federal Capital. He wasn\u2019t a Pepsi worker.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states: You can\u2019t get HIV from consuming food handled by someone with HIV. Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus.\n\nThough it is very rare, HIV can be spread by eating food that has been pre-chewed by someone with HIV. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver\u2019s mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants.\n\n\n\nThe complete fact check of the viral post can be read here.\n\nWe spoke to Yasmin Patel, an official from the Consumer Department of Pepsico. She said, \u201cThis news is circulating since many years. This is a hoax. Nothing as such happened in Pepsi.\u201d\n\nWe performed the social scanning of the viral post and found that the user is based out of Sudan.\n\nConclusion: The viral post claiming that the man featured in the post added HIV-infected blood in pepsi is fake. Neither the man shown in the post is a worker from Pepsi nor the claim related to the HIV-contaminated Pepsi is true.", "lang": "en"}
