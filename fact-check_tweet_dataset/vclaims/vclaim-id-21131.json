It doesn\u2019t show Trump\u2019s earlier interaction with the young boy, who also wasn\u2019t trying to shake the president\u2019s hand, his mom said.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, the President gathered a number of people willing to be political props, dubbing them the \u2018victims of Obamacare\u2019 at the White House while he made a vague, rambling pitch for its repeal that was entirely devoid of any discussion of policy or the catastrophic effects that repeal would have,\u201d the Washington Journal story says.\n\n\u201cWhen he was finished, he turned to shake the hands of those behind him \u2014 except for one child, who happened to be in a wheelchair.\u201d\n\nThe 24-second video clip embedded in the story does show Trump shaking hands with several adults and engaging with some of the children while moving past Montgomery Weer, a three-year-old with spina bifida, who has his hand extended. But a longer White House video shows that earlier, as he walked to the podium to make his remarks, Trump stopped to speak to the boy.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Weer wasn\u2019t trying to shake Trump\u2019s hand, according to his mother, Marjorie, who cleared up what happened on social media.\n\n\u201cTrump didn\u2019t snub my son & Monty wasn\u2019t even trying to shake his hand (1. He\u2019s 3 and hand shaking is not his thing, 2. he was showing off his newly acquired secret service patch),\u201d she wrote on Facebook. (In both videos, the boy appears to have something in his hand.)\n\nEven \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling, who criticized Trump on Twitter for the alleged snub, was misled by the video clip. Rowling later deleted her tweets and apologized to the family.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nDickinson, Natalie. \u201cThis Video Of A Disabled Toddler Trying To Shake Trump\u2019s Hand And Getting Ignored Will Break Your Heart.\u201d Washingtonjournal.com. 29 Jul 2017.\n\nBilefsky, Dan. \u201cJ.K.
