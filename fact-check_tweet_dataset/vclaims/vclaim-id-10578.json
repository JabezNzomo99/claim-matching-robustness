The same figures for all EU immigrants show smaller contributions.\n\nThis research has since been updated, but even then this study doesn\u2019t present an undisputed picture of immigrants\u2019 costs and contributions to the UK.\n\nNot all research agrees on this topic\n\nThere is no single \u2018correct\u2019 answer to the question of how much immigrants contribute to public finances, according to the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford.\n\nResearchers make different assumptions which affect their numbers, such as how to find the cost of educating the children of immigrants and the impacts of migration on economic growth and unemployment.\n\nThe particular findings of one study alone shouldn't be quoted without context or reference to who's made the estimates.\n\nAccording to one study, EU immigrants and recent arrivals contribute more\n\nImmigrants who arrived in the UK since 2000 contribute more in taxes than they receive in benefits and other state assistance, on average. That\u2019s based on research analysing the years from 2001 to 2011.\n\nFor those from the EU the picture was most positive: they were estimated to have contributed \u00a31.34 for every \u00a31 they took out. This what the headline claim refers to.\n\nThe same research found those from outside the EU put in \u00a31.02 for every \u00a31 received.\n\nThis is only part of the story though. Recent arrivals tend to be younger than those here for a longer time, and this can mean they\u2019re less likely to be receiving state assistance. And if people come here when they\u2019re working-age and leave before they get old, they\u2019re much more likely to be putting in more than they take out.\n\nImmigrants here for longer contribute less to public funds\n\nThe same research looked at all immigrants living in the UK between 1995 and 2012\u2014these people could have arrived decades ago in some cases. For EU immigrants the contributions were smaller and those from outside the EU took out more than they put in.\n\nEU immigrants living in the UK are thought to have contributed \u00a31.05 for every \u00a31 received and, for non-EU immigrants, 85 pence for every \u00a31.\n\nNon-EU immigrants are more likely to have had children while in the UK than EU immigrants. Counting the cost of those children\u2019s education is one reason why the contributions are lower than the receipts for this group.\n\nThis research has since been updated, but the figures largely aren\u2019t equivalent to the ones quoted above.\n\nThe latest findings estimate that recent immigrants from the 10 countries that joined the EU in 2004 (mainly eastern European) contributed \u00a31.12 for every \u00a31 received. Those from the rest of the EU put in \u00a31.64 for every \u00a31.", "lang": "en"}
