They want to steal your liberty, your freedom.\"\n\nThe president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. sounded a similar theme: \"It starts by rejecting radicals who want to drag us into the dark, and embracing the man who represents a bright and beautiful future for all. It starts by re-electing Donald J. Trump president of the United States.\"\n\nElected officials and former administration members who spoke Monday night included Sen. Tim Scott and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, both of South Carolina. Their speeches focused on their own biographies but also contrasted the Republican Party and Trump with \"radical\" or \"socialist\" Democrats.\n\nWe fact-checked several claims from speakers during the convention\u2019s first evening.\n\n\"We actually saw revenues to the Treasury increase after we lowered taxes in 2017. Rest assured the Democrats do not want you to know that.\"\n\nTax revenues rose by 0.4% between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 (federal fiscal years run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.). But that small increase disappears once you account for inflation. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors shrinking the federal deficit, found that once you adjust for inflation, tax revenues actually fell by about 1.6%. When you factor in economic growth, revenues fell even more.\n\nIn fact, the actual amount of tax revenue collected in FY2018 was significantly lower than government projections made before the tax package was signed into law, according to a February 2020 analysis by the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"In 1994, Biden led the charge on a crime bill that put millions of Black Americans behind bars.\"\n\nThis needs context. Analysts don\u2019t cast the 1994 crime bill as the sole driver for mass incarceration. Experts say Biden\u2019s 1994 bill was part of a trend that was already underway on the state level.\n\nAnnual reports from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics show that the Black incarceration rate rose from about 1,200 per 100,000 in 1985 to about 2,450 per 100,000 in 2000. (This is for both men and women. The rate for Black men in 2000 was 3,457 per 100,000.)\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible to draw a straight line between those changes and the crime bill, experts say. Also, criminal policy is driven mostly by state and local decisions, not federal.\n\n\"The act didn\u2019t cause mass incarceration,\" Hadar Aviram, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings told us in 2019. \"Prison populations started rising two decades earlier, in the early 1970s, and by 1994 had already more than tripled, from 300,000 to over 1 million.\"\n\nThe U.S. prison population continued to rise after the 1994 act took effect. But the overall rate of growth slowed down.\n\nNikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations\n\nSays Joe Biden and Kamala Harris \"want massive tax hikes on working families.\"\n\nThis is False. Biden has said he said that \"no new taxes\" would be imposed on anyone making under $400,000.\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal would repeal provisions in Trump\u2019s tax law for taxpayers earning over $400,000. Specifically, Biden would:\n\u2022 Increase the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%;\n\u2022 Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners.\n\n\"When we brought in good-paying jobs (to South Carolina), Biden and Obama sued us. I fought back, and they gave up.\"\n\nThis partially accurate recounting of a labor dispute exaggerates some of the details.\n\nHarking back to her time as South Carolina governor, Haley is referring to a hearing process between the National Labor Relations Board and airplane manufacturer Boeing after the company decided to start a production line in South Carolina. (It wasn\u2019t technically a lawsuit.) Boeing\u2019s move in 2009 was essentially taking some work away from union plants in Puget Sound, Wash.\n\nThe International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union complained, and the federal board started a hearing process against Boeing on the grounds that it built its factory in South Carolina to punish the union. Retaliation of that sort, if proven, violates federal labor law.\n\nThe union and Boeing eventually struck a four-year deal in December 2011 that provided raises, job protections and a commitment to make more planes in the Puget Sound area. With the South Carolina plant no longer seen as a threat to jobs in Washington state, the union dropped its complaint and the NLRB ended the process.\n\nAs for the political overtones that Haley mentioned, while the case was handled by the Obama-appointed general counsel, it never came before the four board members that Obama appointed. We previously found no evidence that the White House intervened.\n\nThe composition and presidential influence varies among different federal agencies, and it's a stretch to portray NLRB actions as directly managed by the Obama administration.\n\n\"Democrats claim to be for workers, but they\u2019ve spent the entire pandemic trying to sneak a tax break for millionaires in Democrat states into the COVID relief bill.\"\n\nThis statement requires more context. Trump Jr. is referring to efforts by Democrats to erase a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that caps the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000. Overall the law\u2019s benefits flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers.\n\nThe Democratic-led House passed a $3 trillion bill in May that included provisions to reinstate the local tax deductions for 2020 and 2021. The bill, known as the Heroes Act, didn\u2019t reach a vote in the Senate.\n\nTrump Jr. said Democrats tried to \"sneak\" in the tax break, but it was widely reported that Democrats wanted to roll back the deduction cap.\n\nThe deduction benefits high-income taxpayers in high-tax jurisdictions, according to the Tax Foundation. New York politicians fought against the deduction. However, it did not only affect states led by Democrats. The deduction has also been used by taxpayers in other states, such as Texas.\n\nTrump\u2019s portrayal of Democrats trying to help out millionaires through the Heroes Act neglects that several provisions would help people of lower and moderate incomes by expanding paid sick leave and lengthening the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures.\n\nBiden has \"pledged to repeal the Trump tax cuts, which were the biggest in our country.\"\n\nBiden\u2019s official campaign proposal is to repeal provisions of Trump\u2019s tax law, but not the whole thing. The specific increases in his plan would primarily hit taxpayers earning over $400,000.\n\nIn one video clip from May 2019, Biden said that the \"first thing\" he will do in office is repeal the GOP tax cuts. However, he appears to be shorthanding his policy in a public event. That\u2019s not his official campaign proposal.\n\nAs for the part about the Trump tax bill being the \"biggest,\" that\u2019s also wrong.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation \u2014 Congress\u2019s nonpartisan arbiter of tax analysis \u2014 said the 2017 tax bill would cost the government (or save taxpayers) about $1.5 trillion over 10 years, or about $150 billion a year.\n\nSeveral bills since 1980 were larger, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product, which is a measure of the size of the overall economy. In inflation-adjusted dollars, the recent tax bill is the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of GDP, it ranks seventh. We\u2019ve summarized the tax laws here.\n\n\"Joe Biden has embraced the left\u2019s insane mission to defund (the police).\"\n\nThis is False. Biden has explicitly said he does not support defunding the police.\n\nBiden in June told \"CBS Evening News\" host Norah O\u2019Donnell that he supports \"conditioning federal aid to police,\" based on whether they meet \"certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.\" In a June opinion piece in USA TODAY, Biden also said that abuse of power in police departments must stop and that reforms were the answer to problems. He said police departments should have the money they need to institute changes and proposed an additional $300 million \"to reinvigorate community policing in our country.\"\n\n\"While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people\u2019s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police,\" Biden wrote. \"The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms.\"\n\n\"Wages (are) rising the fastest for lower income levels.\"\n\nThere\u2019s little evidence that the lowest-income workers are seeing wage increases that exceed those of higher-income Americans.\n\nSince Trump took office, the lowest-income workers have seen largely stagnant wages, while the top 5% show the sharpest increase, according to federal data compiled by the liberal Economic Policy Institute.\n\nAnd to the extent that lower-income workers have gained in recent years, it\u2019s because of state and local minimum-wage increases pushed by Democrats, often over Republican opposition. A Washington Post analysis found that before 2016, wages for lower-paid workers rose across the country at more or less the same pace. Starting in 2017, though, wage growth in states that increased minimum wages began to accelerate.\n\nLouis Jacobson, Amy Sherman, Samantha Putterman and Miriam Valverde contributed to this report.
