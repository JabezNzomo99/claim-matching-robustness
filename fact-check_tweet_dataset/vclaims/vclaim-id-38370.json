{"title": "No, Celine Dion Didn't Die in a Plane Crash", "subtitle": "The singer was killed (again) by a death hoax.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2019-11-07T09:40:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-38370", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/death-hoax-celine-dion-crash/", "vclaim": "In November 2019, a video supposedly featuring a CNN news report about the death of singer Celine Dion was widely circulated on social media:\n\nThis is not a genuine CNN news report, and Dion did not perish in a plane crash.\n\nThis video is not hosted on CNN.com. Rather, it was posted on websites such as online.newstrends2k18.info and https://worldnews.hytactv.info. These are not a credible sources for news. In fact, these websites don\u2019t appear to have a functioning homepage and seem to have been set up simply to host this fraudulent news report.\n\nViewers who watched this video will notice that the two news anchors never actually say Celine Dion\u2019s name. Rather, they say \u201cwe have some terribly sad news to report this morning, heartbreaking, and devastating\u201d before cutting away to a still image of the singer. That\u2019s because the first few seconds of this video come from a news report about the death of a different celebrity: chef Anthony Bourdain.\n\nWhoever created the fraudulent video took the first few seconds from CNN\u2019s report on Bourdain\u2019s death, changed the chyron to read about Dion, and then cut the footage short and replaced it with an image of the singer.\n\nWe should also note that this fake video started circulating on or prior to Nov. 3, 2019. Since then, Dion has held concerts in Milwaukee and Detroit, something that would be difficult to do after dying in a plane crash:\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time she has been the target of a death hoax. We covered a similar false rumor back in 2013.", "lang": "en"}
