The tweet was deleted by the handle after twitter users pointed out the gaffe.\n\nBOOM did a Google Reverse Image Search of the picture and found that it had been used on several websites as a stock photo of photovoltaic power stations.\n\nWe also found the image on old URLs.\n\nThe website Convert News featured the same image. BOOM was able to parse EXIF data of the photograph to reveal the camera, settings and date when the picture was shot.\n\nExif of the picture shows that it was taken with a Panasonic DMC-FZ30 camera on June 8th, 2006.\n\nHere's a better quality image showing the exact same meta data.\n\nThe Pocking solar park formerly the world\u2019s largest grid-connected photovoltaic system with a power of 10 megawatts is built on a former military base near Pocking in Bavaria (Germany). Construction of the solar park began in August 2005 and was completed in March 2006.\n\nBOOM also did a comparison of the actual photo and satellite images using exact co-ordinates of the plant available online.\n\nOn March 1st, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah inaugurated the first phase of the Pavagada solar park in Thirumani of Tumakuru district, about 180 km from Bangalore. The park is said to become the world\u2019s largest when it reaches its full potential of 2,000 MW, the Hindu reported. The first phase of the park has 600 MW. Another 1,400 MW will be added by December 2018. The project has been named \u2018Shakti Sthala\u2019 and has been built at an estimated cost of Rs. 16,500 crores. The solar park spans across 13,000 acres spread over five villages.\n\nThe park's development was initiated by the Karnataka Solar Power Development Corp. Ltd (KSPDCL), an entity formed in March 2015 as a joint venture between Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd (KREDL) and Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI).\n\nSiddaramaiah on March 4th tweeted a few actual photos from the inauguration.", "lang": "en"}
