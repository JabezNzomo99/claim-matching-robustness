In the video, Ram Katha preacher Morari Bapu can be seen.\n\nThe above tweet is by a user Geetika Swami, who is followed on Twitter by the office of Nirmala Sitharaman. It has been retweeted over 750 times so far. On Facebook too, the video has been shared with this narrative.\n\nFACT CHECK: NOT THE CROWN PRINCE OF ABU DHABI\n\nThe claim accompanying the video is false. The person seen in the video is NOT the crown prince of Abu Dhabi (Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan), but a United Arab Emirates-based columnist and commentator on Arab affairs named Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi. His profile may be accessed here.\n\nThe video in question is from Abu Dhabi, and dates back to September 2016. The complete video, uploaded on Morari Bapu\u2019s official YouTube channel, can be seen below. In his opening remarks, an unknown speaker is heard announcing a list of guests. However, the name of the Crown Prince is not announced. Moreover, he cannot be visually spotted in the guests that were present for the event. Hence, it is evident that Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was not present at the event.\n\nThe same video clip had been shared on social media earlier in 2019, with the claim that the video showed the Sultan\u2019s wife carrying the Ramayana on her head as she walked towards the first Hindu temple constructed in Abu Dhabi. The narrative was false at multiple levels. The first temple in Abu Dhabi is still under construction. The foundation stone laying ceremony was held in April 2019.\n\nIn February 2018, Alt News had debunked another video pertaining to the same event, where it was falsely claimed by leading news channels \u2013 Times Now and Zee News \u2013 that Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan attended the Ram Katha of Morari Bapu in Abu Dhabi. Later, it was found that the person is not the crown prince but a UAE columnist and commentator on Arab affairs named Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi.\n\nIt may be reiterated that the video in question does not show the crown prince of Abu Dhabi chanting \u2018Jai Siya Ram\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
