(The Palestinian who stabbed Force was allegedly shot and killed by a police volunteer even though a video indicates he was wounded and no longer posed a danger.) Palestinians say the payments are intended to balance an unfair system imposed by an occupying power. The payments include $10 million a year in allowances to Palestinians to buy food, clothing and other items in the prison shop (\u201ccanteen\u201d) that pays royalties to the Israeli prison system.\n\nItai Bar-Dov, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, said the government considers all payments to prisoners to be for acts of terrorism. \u201cThe PA only pays those who have been convicted in an Israeli court for causing or attempting to cause harm against Israelis,\u201d he said. He acknowledged, however, that the martyr payments are more complex. \u201cThere are also payments to families of Palestinians who were killed (shuhada),\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, we don\u2019t deem everyone to be terrorists, and that of course depends on the circumstances of their death.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
