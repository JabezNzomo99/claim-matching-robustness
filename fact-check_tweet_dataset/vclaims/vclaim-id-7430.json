In exchange, AMI received the rights to her story of an extramarital affair with Trump with the express purpose of killing McDougal\u2019s story and preventing it from influencing the election, according to the plea agreement.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty to two campaign finance law violations. Under federal law, individuals such as Cohen cannot make a contribution that exceeds $2,700 per election, and corporations, such as the Trump Organization and AMI, cannot make campaign contributions.\n\nBelow are two timelines that record the false, misleading and contradictory statements made by Trump, Cohen, Giuliani and others about the payments to Daniels and McDougal.\n\nThe timelines show, for example:\n\u2022 Trump denied knowing anything about the payment to Daniels, answering \u201cno, no \u2013 what else?\u201d when asked on April 5 if he knew about the $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\u2022 Cohen lied when, on Feb. 13, he claimed he paid Daniels using his own funds and was not reimbursed. He falsely said, \u201cNeither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford,\u201d Daniels\u2019 real name.\n\u2022 Trump and Giuliani falsely claimed that Cohen was reimbursed by Trump, not the Trump Organization or the campaign, and that the payments were drawn from a legal retainer that wealthy clients typically have with lawyers. The Justice Department said that \u201cthere was no such retainer agreement.\u201d\n\u2022 When asked about the $150,000 payment AMI made to McDougal, T Journal on Nov. 4, 2016 : \u201cWe have no knowledge of any of this.\u201d\n\u2022 A White House spokesperson in February dismissed a New Yorker story about Trump, McDougal and AMI as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nWe start with the $130,000 payment to Daniels, a story that was first reported by the Wall Street Journal at the start of this year.\n\nJan. 12 \u2014 The Wall Street Journal writes that Michael Cohen arranged a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. The White House, Cohen and Daniels \u2014 in a statement put out by Cohen on behalf of Daniels \u2014 all deny the affair and/or hush money.\n\n\u201cThese are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,\u201d the White House says in a statement to the Journal.\n\n\u201cRumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false,\u201d Daniels says in a statement released by Cohen. \u201cIf indeed I did have a relationship with Donald Trump, trust me, you wouldn\u2019t be reading about it in the news, you would be reading about it in my book.\u201d (Daniels would later deny that she signed the statement.)\n\n\u201cThese rumors have circulated time and again since 2011. President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence, as has Ms. Daniels,\u201d Cohen tells the Washington Post.\n\nJan. 18 \u2014 Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah aboard Air Force One tells the press that questions about the payment to Daniels were \u201canswered during the campaign.\u201d\n\nJan. 30 \u2014 Appearing on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!,\u201d Daniels denies signing a statement put out by Cohen on Jan. 12 in which she said she did not receive \u201chush money\u201d from Trump. \u201cThat does not look like my signature does it,\u201d Daniels says. \u201cI do not know where it came from.\u201d\n\nFeb. 13 \u2014 Cohen issues a statement to the New York Times claiming that he paid Daniels and falsely saying he was not reimbursed by the Trump Organization.\n\n\u201cNeither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,\u201d Cohen\u2019s statement says. \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d\n\nMarch 7 \u2013 At a press briefing, a reporter asks White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders \u201cdid the president approve of the payment\u201d to Daniels, and Sanders says that the president \u201cmade very well clear that none of these allegations are true.\u201d\n\nReporter: Sarah, you\u2019ve said repeatedly that we\u2019ve addressed our feelings on that situation, in regards to the Stormy Daniels payment. But specifically, can I ask, did the president approve of the payment that was made in October of 2016 by his longtime lawyer and advisor, Michael Cohen? Sanders: Look, the president has addressed these directly and made very well clear that none of these allegations are true. This case has already been won in arbitration. And anything beyond that, I would refer you to the president\u2019s outside counsel. Reporter: When did the president address, specifically, the cash payment that was made in October of 2016 to \u2014 Sanders: The president has denied the allegations against him. And, again, this case has already been won in arbitration. Anything beyond that, I would refer you to outside counsel. Reporter: But did he know about that payment at the time, though? Sanders: Jeff, I\u2019ve addressed this as far as I can go. Reporter: I\u2019m not talking about the actual allegations, but about the payment. Did he know about the payment at the time? Sanders: Not that I\u2019m aware of. And, again, anything beyond what I\u2019ve already given you, I would refer you to the president\u2019s outside counsel.\n\nMarch 26 \u2014 A day after Daniels appeared on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d to discuss her alleged affair with Trump, the White House deputy press secretary says that \u201cthe president strongly, clearly, and has consistently denied these underlying claims.\u201d\n\nApril 5 \u2014 In a brief exchange with reporters on Air Force One, Trump denies knowing about the payment to Daniels:\n\nApril 9 \u2014 The FBI executes a search warrant at Cohen\u2019s home, office and hotel room.\n\nApril 26 \u2014 In an interview on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Trump says Cohen \u2014 whom he refers to as a \u201cgood guy\u201d \u2014 handles a \u201ctiny, tiny little fraction\u201d of his overall legal work. Trump says Cohen represented him on the \u201ccrazy Stormy Daniels deal,\u201d but the president goes on to falsely claim that Cohen did \u201cabsolutely nothing wrong\u201d because the payment wasn\u2019t made by campaign funds. (In a previous story, we explain why it could still be a campaign violation even if campaign funds were not used. Federal law states that a personal loan or \u201canything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office is a contribution,\u201d whether or not it is repaid.)\n\nMay 2 \u2014 In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, Giuliani discloses for the first time that Trump repaid Cohen, but makes the false claim that the payment was \u201cperfectly legal\u201d because campaign funds weren\u2019t used. He also claims the president \u201cdidn\u2019t know about the specifics\u201d of the payment.\n\nHannity later in the interview asks if Trump knew about the payment.\n\nAfter the Hannity interview, Giuliani falsely tells the Washington Post later that night that Trump reimbursed Cohen through a $35,000 monthly retainer, beginning in January or February 2017. \u201cThe repayments took place over a period of time, probably in 2017, probably all paid back by the end of 2017,\u201d Giuliani says. (Giuliani\u2019s claim about the legal retainer is false. In announcing the plea agreement with Cohen, the Department of Justice would later say, \u201cIn truth and in fact, there was no such retainer agreement, and the monthly invoices COHEN submitted were not in connection with any legal services he had provided in 2017.\u201d)\n\nMay 3 \u2014 Trump tweets that the payment to Daniels had \u201cnothing to do with the campaign,\u201d (contrary to Cohen\u2019s subsequent guilty plea statement), and falsely claims Cohen \u201creceived a monthly retainer.\u201d\n\nSanders, the White House press secretary, is asked at a press briefing why Trump \u201cwas not truthful with the American people\u201d when the president on April 5 denied knowing anything about the Daniels payment or where the money came from. Sanders says that \u201cthe president didn\u2019t know at the time, but eventually learned\u201d about the payment.\n\nMay 4 \u2014 In remarks to reporters, Trump falsely denies that he changed his story about payments made to Stormy Daniels. Specifically, he tells reporters to \u201cgo take a look at what we said\u201d on April 5 \u2014 which is when the president denied knowing anything about the payment or where the money came from.\n\nAug. 21 \u2014 Cohen admits in open court that he made a $130,000 payment to Daniels \u201cat the direction\u201d of Trump without mentioning Daniels or Trump by name. He pleads guilty to campaign finance violations, telling the judge that illegal payments were made to two women \u201cfor the purpose of influencing the election.\u201d Cohen\u2019s attorney would later confirm that the payments were made to Daniels and McDougal at Trump\u2019s direction.\n\nAug. 22 \u2014 Trump tweets that Cohen has decided to \u201cmake up stories in order to get a \u2018deal\u2019\u201d with federal prosecutors. He falsely claims that the two campaign finance violations \u201care not a crime.\u201d Cohen admitted to paying or causing payments totaling $280,000 to keep two women silent during the campaign and being repaid for one of the payments by the Trump Organization. Under federal law, individuals such as Cohen cannot make a contribution that exceeds $2,700 per election, and corporations, such as the Trump Organization, cannot make campaign contributions.\n\nIn an excerpt of an interview with Fox News, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host Ainsley Earhardt asks the president if he knew about the payments to Daniels and McDougal. \u201cLater on I knew. Later on,\u201d he says, without saying exactly when. He goes on, again, to falsely claim that there was no campaign finance law violation because the payments were not made by the campaign.\n\nNov. 4, 2016 \u2014 The Wall Street Journal publishes a story saying, \u201cThe company that owns the National Enquirer, a backer of Donald Trump, agreed to pay $150,000 to a former Playboy centerfold model for her story of an affair a decade ago with the Republican presidential nominee, but then didn\u2019t publish it, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the matter.\u201d The Journal reports that Karen McDougal signed the agreement with American Media Inc. in August 2016.\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks tells the Journal: \u201cWe have no knowledge of any of this.\u201d She says, according to the newspaper, that the claim of an affair between McDougal and Trump was \u201ctotally untrue.\u201d\n\nAMI, whose chairman and CEO, David J. Pecker, is friends with Trump, denies that this was an instance of \u201ccatch and kill\u201d \u2014 paying for the exclusive rights to a story with no intention of publishing it. \u201cAMI has not paid people to kill damaging stories about Mr. Trump,\u201d the company says in a statement to the Journal.\n\nFeb. 16, 2018 \u2014 The New Yorker publishes a story on McDougal\u2019s alleged affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007 and the contract with AMI. A White House spokesperson tells the magazine: \u201cThis is an old story that is just more fake news. The President says he never had a relationship with McDougal.\u201d\n\nJuly 23 \u2014 In a press briefing, a reporter asks if the president still denied that he had a relationship with McDougal. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders says, \u201cOnce again, the president maintains that he\u2019s done nothing wrong, and I would refer you to Rudy Giuliani for all questions on that matter.\u201d\n\nJuly 24 \u2014 CNN obtains an audio recording from Cohen\u2019s attorney, Lanny Davis, of Cohen and Trump discussing the payment to McDougal in September 2016. \u201cI need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David [Pecker],\u201d Cohen says in the recording. The two men discuss arranging a payment. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to pay,\u201d Cohen says, and Trump seems to say, \u201cpay with cash,\u201d though the recording is muddled.\n\nAug. 21 \u2014 Cohen pleads guilty to tax evasion and campaign finance violations in federal court. Cohen says in court: \u201cOn or about the summer of 2016, in coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office, I and the CEO of a media company at the request of the candidate worked together to keep an individual with information that would be harmful to the candidate and to the campaign from publicly disclosing this information \u2026 under which she received compensation of $150,000.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice press release on the plea says that in August 2015 Cohen and \u201cone or more members of the [Trump] campaign\u201d were involved in an offer by \u201cthe Chairman and Chief Executive of Corporation-1, a media company that owns, among other things, a popular tabloid magazine\u201d to \u201chelp deal with negative stories about Individual-1\u2019s relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided.\u201d\n\nThe press release says that in June 2016 \u201cWoman-1,\u201d who is McDougal, attempted to sell her story of an affair. \u201cAt COHEN\u2019s urging and subject to COHEN\u2019s promise that Corporation-1 would be reimbursed, Editor-1 ultimately began negotiating for the purchase of the story,\u201d the DOJ release says. The agreement with McDougal was struck on Aug. 5, 2016.", "lang": "en"}
