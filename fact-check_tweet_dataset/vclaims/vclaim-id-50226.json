The sign makes reference to the \u201cNB Emergency Measures Act,\u201d where \u201cNB\u201d stands for the Canadian province of New Brunswick. On March 19, 2020, New Brunswick declared a state of emergency under the Emergency Measures Act and issued a mandatory order in response to the threat posed by COVID-19 to public health and safety. According to that mandatory emergency measure issued (and repeatedly renewed) by the provincial minister of public safety, Carl Urquhart, businesses in New Brunswick that admitted customers for purposes such as eating and drinking were required to \u201cmaintain a record of the names and contact information of all persons who attend\u201d and to \u201cmake those records available to Public Health Inspectors\u201d:\n\nThe purpose of such measures is to enable the tracking and tracing of any COVID-19 cases arising in persons who have visited a particular establishment, and to warn and protect other patrons who may have been exposed to them.", "lang": "en"}
