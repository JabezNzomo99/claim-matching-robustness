The picture is not from India, but Bangladesh.\n\nThe image with the false claim is also going viral on Facebook. The archived version can be seen here.\n\n\n\nUsing Google reverse image search, we found that many Bengali news website have used similar pictures in their articles while reporting the incident.\n\nAs per Bangla Tribune, an online newspaper in Bangladesh, the incident took place recently in Noakhali district of the country.\n\nOn May 29, police recovered the bodies of a woman named Bibi Mariam and her two-and-a-half-month-old daughter. Mariam's brother alleged that she often had altercations with her husband over his extra-marital affair, and which is why she was killed along with the baby.\n\nAnother report said all the family members of the deceased woman's husband had absconded after the incident. A Bangladeshi newspaper called the daily observer had also covered the incident.\n\nTherefore, it can be said that the picture used in the viral claim has no relation to India. It was an incident in Noakhali district of Bangladesh.", "lang": "en"}
