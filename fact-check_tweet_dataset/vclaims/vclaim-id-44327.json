It had been uploaded by a YouTube handle called Prabhat Khabar.\n\nThis indicates that the video is not related to anti-NRC protests at Lucknow\u2019s Ghanta Ghar.\n\nOn conducting a reverse search on more images, we came across two news reports that provided some context to the incident.\n\nOne report dated 24 November 2017, by a Hindi website called Rajneeti Today, carried photos of the same incident and said that it had taken place in Uttar Pradesh. The report also said that these two women had come to vote wearing burqas and were trying to cast fake votes. The video had gone viral at that time, according to the report.", "lang": "en"}
