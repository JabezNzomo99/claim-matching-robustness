At the time of writing it had been retweeted over 3,000 times.\n\nThe particular brand of glucose sensor mentioned in the tweet is available on the NHS across the UK to some extent.\n\nIn November 2017 it was added to the drug tariff\u2014which sets out how much pharmacists and GP practices will be reimbursed for prescribing various drugs or medical devices to patients.\n\nIn England\u2014where the UK government is responsible for healthcare\u2014it is ultimately up to individual groups of GPs, consultants and other NHS staff responsible for spending on healthcare in the local area to decide whether the sensor is funded and available.\n\nNHS England has said that from April 2019 the FreeStyle Libre will be available on prescription for all patients in England who meet the\n\nThese glucose sensors are available to some extent on the NHS across the UK\n\nThe FreeStyle Libre is \u201ca small sensor... placed under the skin to check glucose levels in the tissue\u2019s fluid. The sensor stays in situ and transmits information about glucose levels to a monitor.\u201d\n\nThe brand of sensor in question is now available on the NHS across Great Britain to some extent and through Health and Social Care Northern Ireland (the NHS equivalent there).\n\nThe original tweet appears to come from a Scottish account. In Scotland the FreeStyle Libre was available in seven of the fourteen NHS health boards as of June 2018.\n\nIn England the FreeStyle Libre has also been introduced in some areas but not in others. An investigation by the British Medical Journal reportedly found that as of July 2018 two of 195 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in England prescribed it to more than 20% of patients with Type 1 diabetes. Another 15 had prescribed it to more than 10% and 25 had issued no prescriptions.\n\nNHS England says that that if CCGs followed the clinical guidance on who can be prescribed the devices, the number of patients with access to them could be increased to around 20-25% across England. It also says that 144 of 195 CCGs have already signed up to providing the Freestyle Libre.\n\nApproving glucose sensors for use across the UK\n\nThere are a number of stages between a drug or health appliance being ready for the market and people being able to purchase it or get it on prescription from the NHS.\n\nThe licence and use of drugs and medical devices in the UK is monitored by , the European Medicines Agency which functions across the EU and European Economic Area (EEA), and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which is a branch of the Department of Health. In order to be made available in the UK a drug or health appliance has to be approved by one of these organisations.\n\nIn September 2014 the FreeStyle Libre glucose sensor was approved by the EMA for use on the European market.\n\nThe route to the NHS\n\nGuidelines on various treatments in England they\u2019re produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u2014though NICE guidance can be used in the rest of the UK too.\n\nThese guidelines are produced to help medical professionals and patients understand the evidence behind a new treatment or device and to help them make decisions about it.\n\nAccording to the Scottish Parliament Information Centre \u201cSIGN guidance is not mandatory but it is expected that healthcare professionals should take it into account in their practice. If it is considered that guidance does not reflect the most recent evidence, clinicians would be expected to look to more recent guidelines such as those from NICE.\u201d\n\nThe most recent NICE guidelines say that \u201cContinuous monitoring of interstitial fluid glucose using a continuous glucose monitor is not recommended for routine use but can be considered for some people (see table 1). No NICE guidelines currently include recommendations for intermittent interstitial fluid glucose monitoring (such as that provided by FreeStyle Libre)\u201d.\n\nTaking the guidance of these bodies into account it is then up to individual CCGs Groups (across England) or NHS Health boards (in Scotland) to decide whether they will introduce the drug or technology in their area.\n\nIn England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland the FreeStyle Libre device has been available for prescription on the NHS since November 2017, though the NHS says this is dependent on local approval and the person being prescribed it meeting certain criteria.\n\nWhere it is available, the NHS says patients typically need to test their blood glucose eight times a day and have \u201cdisabling hypos\u201d before they would be prescribed a sensor.\n\nPrivate purchase is also possible\n\nIt is also possible to purchase the FreeStyle Libre separately, rather than getting it on prescription. The NHS\u2019s \u201crough guide\u201d says that this will cost around \u00a3150 for the starter pack and then another \u00a350 each for more sensors and readers to top this up.", "lang": "en"}
