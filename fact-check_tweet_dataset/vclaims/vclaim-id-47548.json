But experts say evidence does not indicate the virus was spreading within the United States at that point, and health authorities put the first case of infection in the country in 2020.\n\n\u201cIf you were sick around Thanksgiving and Christmas\u201d and \u201cthe doctor told you that you tested negative for strep and flu, and said you \u2018MAY\u2019 have an \u2018Upper Respiratory Infection\u2019 because it was hard to breath and that you would have to let it run its course, and it took a minimum of 10+ days.. You my friend have already had the Coronavirus,\u201d an April 21, 2020 post by a Facebook user whose location is given as Ohio says.\n\nThe same text is included in other Facebook posts archived here and here, from users whose profiles also identify them as being US-based.\n\nDr. Julian Leibowitz, an expert in coronaviruses who is a professor of microbial pathogenesis and immunology at Texas A&M\u2019s College of Medicine, said of the claim: \u201cThis statement is just so wrong.\u201d\n\nThere is \u201cabsolutely no data that I know of to directly support this statement,\u201d he told AFP by email.\n\nDr. Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses who chairs the Biological Sciences department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, agreed.\n\nThe first US case of COVID-19 was \u201ccertainly not at Thanksgiving, but possibly earlier in January than we had anticipated,\u201d he said by email, adding that it is \u201cextremely unlikely that there were coronavirus cases spreading in the US in December 2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe virus would have likely spread far more than it has, if it had been moving from person to person in the United States for two months longer,\u201d Neuman said.\n\nThe novel coronavirus and the disease it causes \u201cwere unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019,\u201d according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe disease -- which mainly spreads from person to person but can also be contracted from contaminated surfaces -- has since proliferated around the world, killing more than 227,000 people and wreaking havoc on the global economy.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s data on COVID-19 cases in the United States lists the earliest date of illness onset as January 14, 2020.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 400 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
