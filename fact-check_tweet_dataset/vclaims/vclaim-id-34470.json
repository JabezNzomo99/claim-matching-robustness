Somehow, we\u2019ve never gotten around to assigning a Pinocchio rating for this claim. Maybe that\u2019s because there aren\u2019t enough Pinocchios available in our system to truly do this justice.\n\nTrump made these comments the day after Fiona Hill, his former top Russia adviser, told Congress that any notion that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 election was a hoax hatched by Russia to deflect from its well-documented efforts to interfere in the vote.\n\n\u201cSome of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThis is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s GOP allies on the committee reacted with some outrage at her comments, insisting that they did not deny Russian involvement. Yet just hours later, Trump once again insisted the real culprit was Ukraine.\n\nThe server (there\u2019s more than one) is not in Ukraine; it\u2019s in Washington, displayed at the DNC\u2019s offices beside a filing cabinet the Watergate burglars pried open in 1972. (Here\u2019s a photo of the server and the filing cabinet that ran on the front page of the New York Times in 2016.)\n\nTrump first publicly raised this strange theory shortly after he became president, in an April 2017 interview with the Associated Press. He brought it up again in his July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s apparently nonplussed president, Volodymyr Zelensky: \u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it,\u201d Trump told Zelensky.\n\nTrump has been obsessed with the idea that the FBI never took physical possession of the servers at the DNC that were hacked. (Our database of Trump\u2019s false and misleading claims shows that he has brought this up more than 20 times.)\n\nBut the FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC\u2019s premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike, which first identified that the DNC had been hacked by Russian operatives. Then-FBI Director James B. Comey testified that his staff told him that this arrangement was an \u201cappropriate substitute.\u201d\n\nNope. CrowdStrike is a California company, founded in 2011 in Sunnyvale. It trades on Nasdaq under the ticket symbol CRWD. In fact, it went public about a month before Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, earning headlines for popping as much as 97 percent in its first day of trading.\n\nIn the space of 10 sentences, Trump told four whoppers. Ukraine does not have the server, the FBI did not need physical possession to investigate, CrowdStrike was not founded by a Ukrainian, and it is not a Ukrainian company. It is dismaying that despite all of the evidence assembled by his top aides, Trump keeps repeating debunked theories and inaccurate claims that he first raised more than two years ago.\n\nThere are some days when we wish we were not limited to just Four Pinocchios. We were tempted to display 16 Pinnochios, four for each false statement. But this claim will certainly end up on our list of the Biggest Pinocchios of 2019.", "lang": "en"}
