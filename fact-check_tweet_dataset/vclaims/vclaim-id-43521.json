The New York Times, which published the op-ed, described the author as \u201ca senior official in the Trump administration whose identity is known to us and whose job would be jeopardized by its disclosure.\u201d\n\nIt prompted several administration insiders to issue statements denying they had written it, and President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call the writer \u201cgutless\u201d and urge the newspaper to reveal his or her identity.\n\nThe writer\u2019s identity still has not been publicly divulged.\n\nTrumpbetrayed.us, a website that describes its mission as provoking conservatives, has now capitalized on the mystery to claim: \u201cWhite House \u2018Resistance\u2019 Mole a Fake \u2013 NY Times Admits They Were Trolled.\u201d\n\nEven though the story was written as a spoof, at least three other websites copied it and presented it as though it were legitimate news. Two of those websites are registered to an owner in Macedonia, and the other is registered to an owner in Pakistan.\n\nAlthough the websites that copied the story don\u2019t have a satire disclaimer, there are some clues that the story isn\u2019t true.\n\nFor example, the story says \u201cArt Tubolls\u201d wrote the op-ed. But that\u2019s the name of a fictitious character who often shows up in spoof stories from America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a network of websites that includes trumpbetrayed.us. Tubolls has been described on America\u2019s Last Line of Defense websites as a spokesman for Michael Jordan, a Comedy Central CEO and a legal analyst.\n\nSimilarly, the bogus story claims to quote New York Times \u201csenior editor John Pragerski,\u201d but there is nobody by that name on the newspaper\u2019s masthead of senior staff.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.\u201d New York Times. 5 Sep 2018.", "lang": "en"}
