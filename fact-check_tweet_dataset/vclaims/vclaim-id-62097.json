I am happy that the chief of Komenda, Nana Kodwo Kru II, is here. The truth is that, people are claiming that the sea defence which is being constructed along the coast of Komenda through to Elmina is the initiative of some NGOs and not the government\u201d, the chief said and pleaded with the Works and Housing Ministry to clear the air on the issue. When contacted via telephone, the chief was not able to name any NGO but insisted that the situation was so in Komenda.\n\nThe chief\u2019s claim came a few days after Vice President Bawumia had mentioned on page 45 of his presentation of the Government\u2019s infrastructure development on Tuesday August 18, 2020 that the Elmina sea project was constructed during the first term of the NPP government.\n\nUpon further research, Dubawa discovered that the Elmina sea defence project is captured in page 88 of the 2020 NPP\u2019s manifesto as part of an ongoing sea protection project being undertaken by the current government together with the ones in Axim, Amanful Kumah, Kommenda, Cape Coast, and Anomabu.\n\nThe same project is also captured in page nine of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for (2018 -2021) of the Ministry of Works and Housing.\n\nIt is stated in the MTEF that \u201cWorks are currently ongoing on the New Takoradi/Elmina, Adjoa, Blekusu and Dansoman whose current statuses of implementation are 40%, 65%, 45% and 45% respectively.\u201d\n\nWe visited the project site and saw signage detailing the nature of the project, location, clients, consultants, and the name of the contractor.\n\nAccording to the inscriptions on the signage, the Elmina sea defence is part of the phase III of the construction of the Takoradi/Elmina emergency sea protection project. It is being constructed by Vuluxx Company Limited, a fully-owned Ghanaian company with the Hydrological Services Department as the consultants.\n\nWhile responding to the chief\u2019s claim, the Minister for Works and Housing, Mr Samuel Atta Akyea, emphasised that the Government of Ghana was financing the construction of the sea defence in the area. He said the project was a five kilometer stretch with a construct sum of $70 million. He added that the project was about 50 percent complete.\n\n\u201cThis is a project we awarded to Vuluxx Company Limited. It is a five kilometer stretch which is ongoing. For now, the contractor has done 50 percent of the work. The contract sum is 70 million dollars. So before we started this project (Elmina fishing port), the President had already cut sod for this coastal protection project currently ongoing. So let us not be deceived,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, outlining some major projects his ministry has implemented as part of the Coastal Protection Project aimed at protecting the beaches and environs at a media briefing in Accra on Wednesday June 24, 2020, Mr Atta Akyea mentioned the Elmina sea defence project.\n\nIn the process of our verification, we did not come across anything that suggested that the Elmina sea defence project was being financed by some NGOs. The chief himself was not able to name any NGO. Therefore, the claim by the people of KEEA that the sea defence project currently under construction in their area was being financed by some NGOs and not by the government of Ghana is false.\n\nThe reporter produced this fact-check under the auspices of the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship to facilitate the ethos of \u201ctruth\u201d in journalism and to enhance media literacy in the country.", "lang": "en"}
