The video is from 2017, when it first surfaced online and shows police cars besieging a Land Rover.\n\nAfter breaking the video to several key frames using the InVid google chrome extemsion, we carried out a reverse image search. That directed us to a freewechat.com article. The article mentioned that the video is from Shandong Wudi in China. Picking up hints from there we carried out a Google keyword search using terms \u2018Shandong Wudi Car Accident\u2019. We then came across another article from February 2015.\n\nThe article mentioned that, \u201con 4 February 2017, a man from Shandong Wudi released a video showing dozens of police cars besieging a Land Rover in a scene like a police bandit.\u201d While we haven\u2019t been able to independently verify the video, the fact that it has been in circulation way before the outbreak was announced on 31 December 2019, proved that it has nothing to do with Coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
