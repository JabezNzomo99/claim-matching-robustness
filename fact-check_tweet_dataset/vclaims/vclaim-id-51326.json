The photos have been shared in a misleading context; the first photo shows the aftermath of a family event in Yala Province in the south of Thailand; the other two photos were indeed taken after an anti-government event in Bangkok.\n\nThe photos were shared hundreds of times after being published in this Facebook post on January 13, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post features a collage of three photos: the top photo shows a park littered with rubbish and a filled blue-coloured bin; the bottom left photo shows a pickup truck parked along a small road surrounded by trees; the bottom right photo shows a grass field with three buildings visible in the background.\n\nThe yellow superimposed text on the first photo translates to: \u201cAt Lumpini Park\u201d, while the text in red, placed across the two bottom photos, read \u201cat Rot Fai Park\u201d.\n\nLumpini Park and Rot Fai Park are both public parks in Bangkok.\n\nThe Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201cTop photo from Lumpini Park 12/1/2020 #WalkToCheerUncle / Bottom photo from Rot Fai Park 12/1/2020 #RunAgainstDictatorship\u201d.\n\n\u201cUncle\u201d is a reference to Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-cha, who is nicknamed \u201cUncle Tu\u201d.\n\nThe post refers to a pro-government and anti-government event held at two parks in the Thai capital in January 2020.\n\nAccording to this report published by Al-Jazeera on January 12, 2020, Rot Fai Park hosted an anti-government \u201cRun Against Dictatorship\u201d march, and a pro-government \u201cWalk to Cheer Uncle\u201d event was held in Lumpini Park, both on January 12, 2020.\n\nThe photos in the misleading post was also shared on Facebook here and here, and on Twitter here, here and here, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe photos have been shared in a misleading context; the first photo was taken at Khwan Muang Park in Yala Province, Thailand after the park hosted an annual Children\u2019s Day event.\n\nAccording to this report published by the English-language Thai newspaper Khaosod English on January 13, 2020, image was taken from a Facebook page named Pattani News.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of Khaosod English article:\n\nIt reads in part: \u201cBut it turned out the photo of dirty \u201cLumpini Park\u201d was actually taken from Pattani News Facebook page, which shows Suan Khwan Muang Park in Yala province after a Children's Day event was held there on Saturday. The page chided festival-goers for not picking trash after themselves.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post published by Pattani News:\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai-language caption translates to English as: \u201cEvery year, there will be snow. This morning in Yala where we have the most beautiful landscape, where people say it\u2019s the cleanest and most liveable city, just Children\u2019s Day and it\u2019s a mess. Let\u2019s help each other, when you travel, please put all your rubbish in the bin. Khwan Muang Park is full of litter. Please help spread the word: January 12, 2020.\u201d\n\nThailand celebrates Children\u2019s Day on the second Saturday of January each year. This year\u2019s event was held on January 11.\n\nDuring a conversation via Line Messenger, a spokesperson for Yala police told AFP that the photo was taken at Khwan Muang Park in Yala after a Children\u2019s Day event, and sent AFP a photo taken from the same angle as that shown in the misleading post.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the photo AFP received from local police (L) and the photo in the misleading Facebook post (R):\n\nLocal police also sent AFP a close-up photo of rubbish bins used exclusively in Yala.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the photo AFP received from local police (L) and the rubbish bin, circled red by AFP, in the misleading Facebook post (R):\n\nTanawat Wongchai, organiser of the \u201cRun Against Dictatorship\u201d event told AFP via Line Messenger on January 15, 2020, that the other two photos in the misleading post were taken by event organisers after the event ended in Bangkok.\n\n\u201cThe original photos were taken by event organisers.
