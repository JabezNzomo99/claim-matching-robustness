However, neither Hopkins nor the district attorney\u2019s office returned our phone calls or email messages.\n\nAdditionally, Wilson police personnel denied a reporter for Raleigh\u2019s local newspaper, The News & Observer, access to a physical copy of the police incident report, citing precautions to limit in-person contact to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, the newspaper reported. The reporter was directed to a web page on the city of Wilson\u2019s website for information on the shooting, and police declined to comment beyond statements posted there.\n\nThat web page did not include copies of a police report, probable-cause statement, arrest warrant or any other documentation to outline the criminal investigation. It began with the following updates:\n\nOn August 9, 2020 at 5:33 p.m., officers of the Wilson Police Department were dispatched to 5100 block of Archers Road in reference to a shooting. Officers arrived on the scene and located a 5 year old suffering from a gunshot wound. Officers and EMS personnel began performing lifesaving efforts. The victim was transported to Wilson Medical Center. Tragically, the victim succumbed to their injuries. \u2026 Officers of the Wilson Police Department have identified Darius N. Sessoms (Wilson/25) as the suspect in this case. Sessoms has an active warrant for 1st Degree Murder and has been entered as wanted with the [FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center] database, with full extradition. The Wilson Police Department is using all its resources to locate and apprehend Sessoms at this time.\n\nBased on that statement, Wilson police believed Sessoms fatally shot a 5-year-old child on Aug. 9, and then fled. North Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Sessoms\u2019 arrest and identified Hinnant as the victim in a statement the following day.\n\nAccording to an interview with a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office in Wayne County (about 30 miles south of Wilson), as well as the Wilson web page, a multi-jurisdictional team of law-enforcement officers including U.S. Marshalls arrested Sessoms in a home in Goldsboro, Wayne County, on Aug. 10.\n\nThe Wilson web page included this mugshot of Sessoms, confirming that he is a Black man:\n\nHe was booked in the Wilson County Jail without bond on charges of first-degree murder and made his first court appearance (virtually) with Wilson County District Court Judge John Britt on Aug. 11. There, Sessoms said he wanted to try to hire a private lawyer to argue his case.\n\nA GoFundMe page established by Gwen Hinnant \u2014 the child\u2019s grandmother, according to his obituary \u2014 included the below-displayed photo that confirmed the child was white.\n\nTo recap, it was accurate to state Hinnant, a white 5-year-old, was fatally shot on Aug. 9, and the person who police believe pulled the trigger \u2014 Sessoms \u2014 is a Black man.\n\nNext, we searched for evidence of an alleged scheme on the part of mainstream news organizations to eschew covering Hinnant\u2019s death because it did not fit within an alleged \u201cpreferred race narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cFox News is the only mainstream outlet in the U.S. that has covered Cannon\u2019s gruesome murder,\u201d someone claimed, referring to stories about the case on FoxNews.com.\n\nTo unpack this claim, we specifically considered commentary by Matt Walsh, a writer for Ben Shapiro\u2019s Daily Wire, who wrote on Aug. 13:\n\nTwo days earlier, he tweeted screenshots that he said were negative search results for Hinnant\u2019s name on the following news sites: The New York Times, The Washington Post, Reuters, Yahoo! News, NBC News, and ABC News.\n\nFor the purpose of our analysis, we will consider those news organizations cited by Walsh as the alleged culprits of a nefarious scheme to keep the child\u2019s death quiet, as well as CNN and The Associated Press, two news organizations with broad audiences. As of Aug. 14, these headlines and other related stories appeared on the following news sites, partly disproving Walsh\u2019s assertion:\n\u2022 \u201cA 25-year-old man has been charged in the shooting death of 5-year-old Cannon Hinnant\u201d (CNN)\n\u2022 \u201c5-year-old shot to death in North Carolina; suspect sought\u201d (The Associated Press)\n\u2022 \u201cAuthorities capture suspect in 5-year-old\u2019s fatal shooting\u201d (The Associated Press)\n\u2022 \u201cMotive a Mystery in 5-Year-Old\u2019s Murder\u201d (NBC New York and NBC Boston).\n\u2022 \u201cFuneral planned for 5-year-old boy shot at point-blank range in N.C.\u201d(NBC12 in Richmond, Virginia).\n\u2022 \u201cWilson man wanted in fatal shooting of 5-year-old apprehended\u201d (WRAL-TV, an NBC-affiliated station, in Raleigh).\n\u2022 \u201c\u2018He meant the world to me\u2019: Family, friends honor life of Cannon Hinnant, the 5-year-old boy shot and killed while riding bike in Wilson\u201d (ABC11 in Raleigh).\n\u2022 \u201c5-year-old shot and killed while outside on bike, 25-year-old charged with murder\u201d (ABC7 in Los Angeles).\n\u2022 \u201cFuneral, vigil scheduled for Cannon Hinnant, the 5-year-old boy killed in North Carolina\u201d (ABC6 in Philadelphia).\n\u2022 \u201cBoy, 5, \u2018shot dead by neighbour\u2019 as he played with sisters\u201d (Yahoo! News)\n\nIn other words, it was inaccurate to claim CNN, The Associated Press, Yahoo! News, NBC News, and ABC News ignored Hinnant\u2019s death.\n\nHowever, we found no related stories by Reuters, The New York Times, or The Washington Post, which meant we next sought evidence to prove or disprove the assertion that those sites purposefully did not cover Hinnant\u2019s killing as part of some conspiracy to cover up the killing of a white child by a Black man.\n\nFor that, we reached out to the news organizations to ask why they had not covered Hinnant\u2019s death and what factors go into those type of editorial decisions, and we will update this report when or if we hear back from them. The news organizations\u2019 ethical policies, which are available online, however, include promises to report the news accurately and fairly without bias \u2014 standards that, in practice, would prohibit the newsrooms from only covering certain stories and purposefully hiding others as part of some nefarious scheme because of the races of those involved.\n\nIn sum, while it is truthful to state that Sessoms, a Black man, was charged in the shooting death of Hinnant, a white 5-year-old, in North Carolina, there is no evidence substantiating a pattern of mainstream news organizations omitting coverage of the child\u2019s death to further a particular racial narrative or for any other purpose. For those reasons, we rate this claim a \u201cMixture\u201d of fact and fiction.", "lang": "en"}
