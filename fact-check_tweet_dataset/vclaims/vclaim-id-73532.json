Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of PM Modi\u2019s letter to UP CM Yogi Adityanath congratulating him for his contribution towards \u2018Hindu Rashtra\u2019 and Ram Mandir. Fact: The letter in the post is fake. The \u2018Press Information Bureau\u2019 has clarified on Twitter that the letter is fake. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe letter is purportedly written by PM Modi in his official capacity to UP CM Yogi Adityanath. So, the use of the word \u2013 \u2018Hindu Rashtra\u2019 and congratulating a State CM for contributing towards a \u2018Hindu Rashtra\u2019 by the PM is highly unlikely as India is a Secular State and the PM in his official capacity would not refer to India as a \u2018Hindu Rashtra\u2019 (Hindu State).\n\nAlso, when we searched further regarding the letter, it was found that the \u2018Press Information Bureau\u2019 has already clarified regarding this issue. They have tweeted that the letter is \u2018fake\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, this letter purportedly written by PM Modi to UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Ram Mandir is fake.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
