Multiple versions say the image is of Hyde Park in London after the protest, while one post also included a picture of climate protests in Australia. The picture has been shared at least 13,000 times in recent days.\n\nThe picture does not show the aftermath of any climate protest. It was actually taken after a \u201c4/20\u201d event promoting the legalisation of cannabis in Hyde Park in April 2019.\n\nThe mess in the same picture was also falsely attributed to Extinction Rebellion climate change protestors back in April, which we debunked at the time.\n\nRoyal Parks, which manages London\u2019s royal parks, said in April that the photo was \u201cthe result of an unofficial event in Hyde Park on Saturday [20 April], not the #ExtinctionRebellion protestors in Marble Arch.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
