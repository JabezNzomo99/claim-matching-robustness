After addressing troops in Nimu base, PM Modi visited a military hospital treating soldiers injured in violent clashes with China in Galwan Valley. Photographs of the Prime Minister\u2019s visit to the hospital ward has sparked a controversy on Twitter. Several members of the Congress party have claimed that a conference hall was converted into a ward for theatrics and photo-op. National media panellist of Congress, Abhishek Dutt, tweeted in Hindi, \u201cHow does this look like a hospital \u2013 no drip, a photographer in place of a doctor, no medicines with the beds, no water.\u201d\n\nOther users whose tweets drew hundreds of retweets and likes were \u2013 Ishaan Sethi, Rofl Republic, Doctor Roshan R and Abhishek Baxi.\n\nDuring his two-day visit to Eastern Ladakh, Army Chief General MM Naravane had visited soldiers in the same ward as PM Modi on June 23.\n\nA video of General Naravane\u2019s visit is posted below.\n\nVisuals clues which suggest that the ward is the same have been highlighted.\n\n3.

These have been marked below.\n\nA door is seen on a different side of the ward and the colour of the beds also match \u2014 PM Modi\u2019s visit (left), General MM Naravane\u2019s visit (right).\n\nThe projector/ stage area visible in pictures of Prime Minister Modi can be spotted in a video of General Naravane\u2019s visit in June. Screenshots of the same have been attached below.\n\nPhotographs of identical interiors of the ward in June prove that it was not set up for PM Modi\u2019s recent visit.\n\nIn a press release on July 4, the Indian army clarified, \u201cThe said facility is part of the Crisis Expansion capacity of 100 beds and is very much part of the General Hospital complex. The COVID-19 protocol had necessitated some wards of the General Hospital to be converted into isolation facilities. Hence, this hall which otherwise was normally used as a Training Audio Video Hall was converted into a ward ever since the hospital was also designated as COVID treatment hospital. The injured braves have been kept there since their arrival from Galwan to ensure quarantine from COVID areas. The Chief of Army Staff General M M Naravane and the Army Commander have also visited the injured braves in the same location.\u201d\n\nResponding to the claim that the patients seen in the photographs are not \u201creal\u201d because they don\u2019t seem injured and are sitting in an upright position, Major Navdeep Singh wrote, \u201cThe soldiers are not there for major physical injuries but for recuperation cum debriefing, a standard process.\u201d\n\nSeveral members of the Congress party and critics of Prime Minister Modi shared photographs of his visit to soldiers recuperating in a hospital ward in Leh. These were accompanied with false claims suggesting that the ward was \u2018set-up\u2019 for the cameras.", "lang": "en"}
