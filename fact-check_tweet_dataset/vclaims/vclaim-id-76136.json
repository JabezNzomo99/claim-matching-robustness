(We also analyze a statement by House Minority Leader John Boehner.)\n\n \n\n We'll take the claims in order.\n\u2022 Did the economy shed 3 million jobs during the last six months of President George W. Bush's administration? Actually, that understates the losses.\n\n \n\n In July 2008, the general employment level was 137,075,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By January 2009, it was 133,549,000 -- a decline of about 3.5 million jobs.\n\u2022 Did the economy shed 3.6 million or 3.7 million jobs in the first six months under Obama? That modestly overstates the losses.\n\n \n\n In January 2009, the general employment level was 133,549,000. In July 2009, it was 130,294,000. That's a decline of 3.26 million jobs.\n\u2022 Did the economy add almost 600,000 private sector jobs during the first six months of this year? Very, very close.\n\n \n\n In December 2009, the number of private-sector jobs stood at 107,107,000. By June 2010, the number was 107,700,000. That's a difference of 593,000 jobs -- \"almost 600,000\" in our book.\n\n \n\n In all, Biden's numbers understated the losses under Bush and overstated the losses under Obama, but both of these errors work against the administration's own interests. And in the third case, Biden's number easily qualifies as \"almost 600,000.\" All in all, we rate Biden's statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
