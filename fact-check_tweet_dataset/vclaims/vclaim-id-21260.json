On this side of the pond, hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Central America have sought refuge in the United States since 2014, many fleeing violence in their home countries.\n\n\u201cAt roughly 5.76 million, the number of criminal offences committed in Germany is the lowest since 1992,\u201d Horst Seehofer, the German minister of the interior, said in a statement May 8. \u201cThis drop in crime is even more apparent in relation to the total population: fewer than 7,000 offences per 100,000 residents. That is the lowest rate in more than 30 years!\u201d\n\nGermany has seen a huge population influx in recent years, taking in \u201cmore than a million migrants, many fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa in 2015 and 2016,\u201d according to Reuters. In 2016, one-fifth of the country\u2019s residents, or 18.6 million, were first- or second-generation immigrants with \u201cat least one parent who was not born with German citizenship,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cAs in the previous year, about 30% of all suspects were not German nationals; the absolute number fell from 616,230 in 2016 to 599,357 in 2017,\u201d according to the German government. \u201cOf this number, 27.9% were asylum applicants, beneficiaries of national or international protection, persons granted asylum status, persons whose deportation has been temporarily suspended, refugees admitted under humanitarian relief programmes or foreigners residing in Germany illegally. This group accounts for 8.5% of all suspects (2016: 8.6%).\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. But one study sponsored by the German government showed that violent crime rose nearly 10 percent in 2015 and 2016, attributing more than 90 percent of that increase to young male refugees. This study paints a partial picture, however, considering the official numbers we discussed above for 2017 and the Germans\u2019 25-year record.\n\n\u201cMy answer is that the interior minister presented the crime statistics a short while ago, and they speak for themselves,\u201d Merkel said June 19. \u201cWe are seeing a slight positive development. We must always do more to fight criminality. But they were very encouraging numbers.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department reports that 90 percent of U.S. prisoners are housed in state or local institutions, and because states generally do not report data breaking down how many of their prisoners are undocumented immigrants, experts on several sides of the immigration debate say it is not possible to verify Trump\u2019s claim.\n\nBut a comparison of census and FBI data shows the U.S. rate of violent crime was cut by nearly half from 1990 to 2013, while the number of undocumented immigrants in the country tripled. And almost all the independent research on this question \u2014 do immigrants bring more crime? \u2014 contradicted Trump in 2015 and continues to do so in 2018.\n\nWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re going out on a limb by saying the Germans probably have more accurate data than Trump on this one. We\u2019re compelled to give the president\u2019s unsupported claim and his bogus warning Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
