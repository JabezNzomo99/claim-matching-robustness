No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that makes a living by publishing fictional stories often involving weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or strange accidents. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on February 7, 2019 titled \"Florida nursing home shut down by FDA for feeding elders with dog food\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA Florida nursing home has been shut down after the Food and Drug Administration found no less than 2,5 tons of expired animal food during an inspection of the facility.\n\nFort Myers police seized over one hundred and twenty 52-lb bags of dog food in the basement of the Mariposa Nursing Center after families of the residents raised a number of complaints which led to an official FDA investigation this week. Many residents reported a number of gastrointestinal symptoms such as severe digestive problems, chronic flatulence, frequent vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. \"We believe residents of the Mariposa Nursing Center were fed large quantities of dog food which were blended into the actual food and made more palatable with salt and sugar,\" Fort Myers Police Officer Ray Johnson said.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut there is no \"Mariposa Nursing Center\" in Fort Myers. And the story is illustrated with a picture of the Fort Myers chief of police (Hilton Daniels) but it was taken as far back as 2006 when it showed up in a news article:\n\nThe current chief of police is Derrick Digs according to the department website:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nOn March 20, 2019 the site added a new header that included the slogan \"Where facts don't matter\" to make it clearer to casual visitors the published content is fictional:\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Zoo Keeper NOT Accused of Impregnating Female Orangutan in Indonesia\n\u2022 Fake News: Elderly Couple Did NOT Burn Down House During Sex Game Involving WW2 Flamethrower\n\u2022 Fake News: 63-year-old Daycare Owner Did NOT Breastfeed Toddlers in Public While Smoking Crystal Meth\n\u2022 Fake News: Cousins NOT Arrested After Refusing to Stop Having Sex During Funeral Ceremony\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Ejaculate in Boss' Coffee Every Day For Four Years", "lang": "en"}
