He claimed it was \u201cthe most incredible thing anyone has ever seen.\u201d It\u2019s not incredible or even unusual.\n\nFBI policy does not require its agents to conduct interviews under oath, and it doesn\u2019t matter, anyway, because it is a crime to lie to the FBI regardless of whether an oath is taken.\n\nThe president made his remarks before departing for Utah, where he announced that he would reduce the size of the state\u2019s Bears Ears National Monument and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. As he prepared to board Marine One, a reporter asked Trump when he learned that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had lied to the FBI.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty on Dec. 1 of making false statements to the FBI during its ongoing investigation into Russia\u2019s efforts to influence the 2016 presidential campaign and whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. The president didn\u2019t answer the question; instead he said the FBI was \u201cvery unfair\u201d to Flynn and \u201cdestroyed his life.\u201d\n\nTrump, Dec. 4: I will say this: Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI and nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life. I think it\u2019s a shame. Hillary Clinton, on the Fourth of July weekend, went to the FBI, not under oath \u2014 it was the most incredible thing anyone has ever seen. She lied many times. Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it\u2019s like they ruined his life. It\u2019s very unfair.\n\nTrump is referring to the FBI\u2019s three-hour-plus interview with Clinton on July 2, 2016, near the end of the agency\u2019s investigation into whether she or her staff mishandled classified information. The investigation stemmed from Clinton\u2019s decision to exclusively use a private email account and personal server when conducting official government business.\n\nThree days after the FBI interviewed Clinton, then-FBI Director James Comey announced that he would not recommend filing charges against Clinton. He said that she and her staff were \u201cextremely careless\u201d in handling classified information, but the FBI did not find evidence that their actions were intentional.\n\nThe FBI also did not find that Clinton lied to the FBI, contrary to Trump\u2019s claim.\n\nAfter announcing the outcome of the FBI investigation, Comey testified on July 7, 2016, before the House oversight committee about his decision not to recommend pressing charges. Chairman Jason Chaffetz specifically asked Comey if Clinton lied.\n\nRepublicans have long maintained that Clinton \u201clied\u201d to the public about her email use. And we have certainly written numerous stories about how Clinton provided the public with false and misleading information about her email use.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a crime to give false information to the public. It is a crime, however, to intentionally provide false information to federal agents during a criminal investigation \u2014 and, contrary to what Trump said, it is a crime whether the subject is under oath or not.\n\nAt the same House oversight hearing, Republican Rep. John Mica asked Comey whether the FBI interviewed Clinton under oath, and Comey said it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThree former FBI agents told us that the agency does not conduct interviews under oath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen an agent put someone under oath \u2014 that\u2019s just not how it operates,\u201d said Michael J. Clark, a special agent for 22 years who now teaches criminal justice at the University of New Haven.\n\nLuke William Hunt, a former FBI agent who teaches criminal justice at Radford University, referred us to the FBI\u2019s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide, a 258-page manual that details the agency\u2019s intelligence-gathering rules. It makes no reference to placing witnesses, subjects or targets of investigations under oath.\n\nIn an email, Hunt told us that \u201cFBI interviews (which \u2018may become the subject of court testimony\u2019) are recorded on the \u2018FD-302\u2019 form. This simply contains a \u2018record of statements made by the interviewee.'\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in Clinton\u2019s case. On Sept. 2, 2016, the FBI released a summary of Clinton\u2019s statements to the FBI.\n\nIn a phone interview, Hunt told us he did not experience any instances of FBI agents placing someone under oath during an interview in his seven years at the agency. Stuart N. Kaplan, a former FBI agent for nearly 11 years who is now a lawyer in private practice, separately told us the same thing.\n\n\u201cWhen conducting interviews subjects/targets and or witnesses are NOT put under oath,\u201d Kaplan said in an email. \u201cAs long as an FBI agent properly identifies him or herself and it\u2019s in the official capacity of his job lying to that agent under 18 USC 1001 is a crime.\u201d\n\nKaplan emphasized that the false statements \u201cmust be intentional or intentionally misleading\u201d for the subject to be charged with a crime. Clark noted that the false statement must be \u201cmaterial\u201d to the investigation.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in Flynn\u2019s case, and he now faces up to six months in prison.\n\nAs for Clinton, the FBI had \u201cno basis to conclude she lied to the FBI,\u201d as Comey said. But, under the law, if she \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d made false statements to conceal \u201ca material fact,\u201d then she could have been charged with a crime whether she was under oath or not.", "lang": "en"}
