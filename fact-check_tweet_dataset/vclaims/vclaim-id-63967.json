The claim, however, is misleading; the video has circulated online since at least March 2020 in reports about an Indian police officer beating a man who allegedly violated lockdown restrictions.\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on August 16, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe protectors of the constitution hoisted a blue flag instead of the tricolour today on the occasion of the Independence Day. Police arrived and attracted waving their sticks.\u201d\n\n\n\n The blue flag represents the Dalit resistance, an anti-government party who says it is striving for equality in India, as reported here in AFP.\n\nThe video was also shared here, here, here, here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found a similar video published here on YouTube on March 25, 2020.\n\nThe video is titled \u201cThe Result of Violating Lockdown\u201d. The footage in the misleading post corresponds to the YouTube video from the beginning to the 20-second mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nA screenshot of the YouTube video was also published here on Rajasthan Patrik, a local Hindi daily newspaper on March 25, 2020.\n\nIndia announced it had implemented a lockdown on March 25, 2020, as AFP reported here. Police officers were seen swinging \"lathi\" batons, a long hardened bamboo cane, to control some crowds on the street, as AFP reported here.\n\nA frame-by-frame analysis of the video shows the badge on the police officer\u2019s uniform at the 11-second mark and the logo on the police car at the 20-second mark. It suggests the incident happened in Maharashtra, the western peninsular region of India.\n\nThe same police officer uniform can be seen in the photos published here on Twitter by the Beed District Police on August 16, 2020.\n\nThe logo seen on the police car, circled in red by AFP below, corresponds with the logo of the Maharashtra Police.\n\nThe Hindi-language caption on the logo translates in English as: \u201cMaharashtra Police\u201d.\n\n\n\n The misleading post was also debunked by an Indian fact-checker BOOM here on August 16, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
