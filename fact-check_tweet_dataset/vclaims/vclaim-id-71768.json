It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

This is not a time to compound one tragedy upon another by spreading fear in our community with false rumors of ICE operations.\"\n\nThe statement reiterated what ICE had tweeted on Aug. 4.\n\nThe agency added that ICE personnel do routinely participate in the initial response to local tragedies, and did provide such support to local and state law-enforcement officials in the immediate aftermath of the El Paso shooting.\n\nHowever, ICE\u2019s role in this immediate response, by policy, does not include immigration enforcement operations, the agency said.\n\nAnother federal agency, the west Texas office of Customs and Border Protection, also tweeted that its personnel did not conduct any \"enforcement operations at area hospitals, the family reunification center or shelters. We stand in support of our community.\"\n\nA widely shared social media post said that \"ICE just rolled up to the school where the families are reunifying after the El Paso shooting to check citizenship papers.\" While ICE did help back up state and local law enforcement officials in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the agency said that immigration enforcement is specifically prohibited in such situations.", "lang": "en"}
