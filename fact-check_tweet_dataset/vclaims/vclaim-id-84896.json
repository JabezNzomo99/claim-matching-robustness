We awarded Three Pinocchios to a series of his odd exaggerations about guns, including the comparisons to buying vegetables. (After the fact-check published, some readers pointed out that he may be referring to \u201cfood deserts,\u201d or areas of the country where it is difficult to buy fresh vegetables.)\n\nFederal law prohibits licensed firearms dealers from selling a handgun, such as a Glock, to people under 21 years old. It prohibits unlicensed people, like family, from selling or transferring handguns to anyone under 18. In most states, you need to be at least 18 to purchase and own a handgun.\n\nJohn Lott, a gun-rights analyst who runs Crime Prevention Research Center, sent us this calculation as an example of access to free public resources for books and computers: There are 80 public libraries and 95 public high schools in Chicago, within a city of about 230 square miles. That comes out to a library or high school every 1.3 square miles, albeit not equally spread out throughout the city.\n\nThe White House pointed us to the full context of the claim to say Obama was making \u201cthe serious point about the lack of opportunity and ready access to guns in way too many places\u201d (the quote we are fact-checking is in bold):\n\n\u201cWe also know what [Dallas Police] Chief [David] Brown has said is true, that so much of the tensions between police departments and minority communities that they serve is because we ask the police to do too much and we ask too little of ourselves. As a society, we choose to under-invest in decent schools. We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental-health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book. And then we tell the police, \u2018You\u2019re a social worker; you\u2019re the parent; you\u2019re the teacher; you\u2019re the drug counselor.\u2019 We tell them to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs and do so without causing any political blowback or inconvenience; don\u2019t make a mistake that might disturb our own peace of mind. And then we feign surprise when periodically the tensions boil over.\u201d\n\nIn Englewood, a Chicago neighborhood, teens have such easy access to illegal guns that they can get one for free or as little as $25 with a simple phone call. A news report by WBEZ Chicago interviewed teenage boys who have bought several guns from fellow gang members or through family or friends, starting when they were as young as 12.\n\nFurther, the 80 branches of public libraries in the city this year plan to distribute more than 1 million books \u201cto address a persistent lack of access to books in low-income neighborhoods. \u2026 There, on average, 300 children share a single book. For middle-income neighborhoods, the ratio of books per child is 13 to 1, library officials said.\u201d According to the Chicago Tribune: \u201cThe challenge is that there are many homes in Chicago that do not have age-appropriate books for kids,\u201d Chicago Public Library Commissioner Brian Bannon said. \u201cObviously, you can take a library book home, but owning your own is very different.\u201d\n\nThis is a catchy talking point that people obviously paid attention to, but it doesn\u2019t make much sense. Literally speaking, not all states allow people under 21 years old to buy a handgun. And as far as we know, there\u2019s no minimum age or a background check required to get a book or use the computer for free at a public library.\n\nThe White House noted that in the context of the speech, Obama was speaking about the lack of opportunity and ready access to guns in many communities, particularly lower-income areas. It\u2019s accurate to say there are communities that lack education, employment and health-care resources. And it\u2019s fair to say that in some communities, there is ready access to illegally obtained guns for teens who can get them easily from a fellow gang member, friend or a family member \u2014 perhaps without even having to leave their home or their street.", "lang": "en"}
