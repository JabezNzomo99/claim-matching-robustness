The post claims that, as per WHO, masks should only be used by healthcare workers, caretakers, or by people who are sick with symptoms like cough and fever. When Vishvas News investigated we found the claim to be misleading. This is outdated guidance that has since been changed. WHO has advised that \u2018medical masks\u2019 should be used by healthcare workers, caretakers, or by people who are sick with COVID-related symptoms. If there is widespread community transmission, and especially in settings where physical distancing cannot be maintained, WHO stated in its recent advisory that governments should encourage the general public to wear a fabric mask. WHO also provides details on the composition of a fabric mask and how to safely wear one.\n\nA post shared on Facebook by a user named \u091a\u0902\u0926\u0928 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092f (Chandan Arya) shows a screenshot with the logo of World Health Organization (WHO).

The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News contacted the Technical Officer at WHO Health Emergencies, SEARO who said: WHO\u2019s guidance on mask use is clearly stated on our website. WHO recommends the use of MEDICAL masks for health workers, people who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19. WHO advises that governments should encourage the use of non-medical fabric masks, which can act as a barrier to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others where there are many cases of COVID-19, for people in the general public where physical distancing of at least 1 metre is not possible \u2013 such as, on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.\n\nShe also shared some important links of advisories issued by WHO on masks.\n\nAccording to WHO, governments are advised to encourage the use of non-medical fabric masks, which can act as a barrier to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others where there are many cases of COVID-19, for people in the general public where physical distancing of at least 1 metre is not possible \u2013 such as, on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.\n\nMasks can be categorised as medical masks or non-medical / fabric masks. WHO\u2019s guidance provides specific considerations for the use of non-medical masks, also known as fabric masks, by people as a means for source control in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare suggests that people who are not suffering from medical conditions or having breathing difficulties may use the handmade reusable face cover, particularly when they step out of their house. This will help in protecting the community at large.\n\nThe old guidance was on the WHO\u2019s website in March 2020. Dr. Baller\u2019s video published in February 2020 on usage of masks can be seen here.\n\nIn June 2020, the World Health Organization updated its guidance, which now recommends that the public wear fabric masks in areas where there is community transmission and where social distancing cannot be maintained.\n\nFox News also stated in its report that WHO has changed its guidance on masks. Here\u2019s the link of the report.\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named \u091a\u0902\u0926\u0928 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092f (Chandan Arya).
