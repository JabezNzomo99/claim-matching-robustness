Awasthi identified himself as an ABVP activist. India Today investigation revealed three names \u2013 Akshat Awasthi (ABVP activist), Rohit Shah, and Geeta Kumari (former JNUSU president and AISA activist) \u2013 who confessed the roles they played that fateful night. The second part of the investigation, broadcast on January 11, provided details of ABVP activist Komal Sharma\u2019s alleged involvement.\n\nAkhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) National General Secretary Nidhi Tripathi issued a statement distancing the student body from Akshat Awasthi and claimed that he is not a member of the organisation, \u201cAkshat Awasthi is neither an office bearer, nor a karyakarta of ABVP, as claimed by IndiaToday\u201d, reads the statement.\n\nResponding to ABVP\u2019s denial, anchor Rahul Kanwal took to Twitter and posted images of Awasthi at \u201can ABVP rally\u201d on November 12, 2019.\n\nRight-wing website OpIndia published a report raising questions against India Today\u2019s investigation and Awasthi\u2019s affiliation with ABVP. The article claimed that the photograph shared by Rahul Kanwal pertained to a rally against hostel fee hike organised by JNUSU. It is noteworthy that ABVP is not a part of the JNU students\u2019 union.\n\nOpIndia traced the image to November 11, 2019, published by Manorama.\u201cThe picture used by Manorama says that the picture is from the 11th of November 2019 when the police stopped JNU students who were staging a protest over the hostel fee-hike issue. The picture was taken by Kamal Singh of PTI,\u201d said article which was also published by right-leaning website Swarajya.\n\nIn this report, Alt News will fact-check two separate claims namely, OpIndia\u2019s assertion that Akshat Awasthi\u2019s presence in a JNUSU rally would suggest that he\u2019s associated with the Left and not ABVP, and ABVP\u2019s assertion that Awasthi is not associated with the student body.\n\nWith a keyword search on Twitter, we found that Awasthi\u2019s image, where he is raising the tricolour, was shared by JNU ABVP account. According to ABVP, the photograph is part of a protest organised against the proposed fee hike in the varsity. \u201cABVP-JNU outrightly rejects the massive fee hike since very first day,\u201d reads its description.\n\nABVP was a part of JNUSU protests but withdrew support on November 19, 2019. According to Economic Times, ABVP backed-out after Left parties accepted HRD ministry\u2019s decision to set up a committee to look into the issue. Since then, the RSS-affiliated body has been protesting independent of the JNUSU protests under Left-backed parties.\n\nOpIndia declared Awasthi a JNUSU activist because of his presence in a protest against the fee hike organised by JNUSU. But OpIndia also proved that the photograph was shot on November 11. This was when ABVP was still supporting the JNUSU protests. The website\u2019s assertion that Awasthi\u2019s presence in the rally organised by JNUSU automatically excludes him from being a part of ABVP doesn\u2019t hold water.\n\nAlt News was also able to independently locate multiple pictures and videos of Awasthi with ABVP members. In the image posted below, he is accompanied with individuals carrying saffron-coloured ABVP scarves.\n\nThe above image was posted by one Shivam Chaurasia on November 21, 2019. \u201cWe are detained in Parliament Street Police Station.#ABVPMarchOn #RollBackFeeHike\u201d, reads the accompanying message. It may be noted that on November 21, 2019, ABVP members were stopped by the police near Parliament Street police station for protesting against fee hike. This image was taken inside the police station.\n\nIn a graphic shared on his Facebook profile, Chaurasia declared himself ABVP\u2019s candidate for councillor.\n\nABVP\u2019s Office Secretary Nawnit Kumar shared a video of their detention where Awasthi can be spotted at 52 seconds.\n\nMoreover, Awasthi can be seen in another video posted by ABVP Secretary Manish Jangid that same day.\n\nBelow is the part where Awasthi is spotted amidst chants of \u201cABVP zindabad\u201d and \u201cKanhaiya Kumar murdabad\u201d.\n\nIn several images posted by ABVP members (Ayush Kasana, Nishul Khrub), Awasthi is seen walking with a group wearing saffron scarves.\n\nABVP\u2019s Secretary Manish Jangid [2] and ABVP member Bharat Sharma [3] were photographed alongside Awasthi [1] in the image below.\n\nThe video below was taken at the same location as the image. Here, Awashti can be spotted standing behind a group of people holding an ABVP banner and chanting, \u201cKaun lada hai ABVP, kaun ladega ABVP.\u201d\n\nWhile ABVP has denied association with JNU student Akshat Awasthi and vice-versa, Alt News has found multiple pictures and videos of Awasthi in protests led by ABVP as well as in photographs with prominent ABVP members and office-bearers, sloganeering in support of the student body.", "lang": "en"}
