If women in labour endure more pain than the \u201chuman body can bear\u201d, it would mean women were superhuman \u2013 or that they always die in childbirth, as fact-checking site\n\nOld unit of pain was the \u2018dol\u2019 \u2013 there\u2019s no \u2018del\u2019\n\nSecond, a unit of measuring pain is the \u201c\n\n\u201c\u2018Dol\u2019 is the term used to denote the unit of painfulness, and has a value of approximately one-tenth the intensity of the maximal pain,\u201d a\n\non the study of pain reported.\n\nThe paper records a pain intensity of 10.5 dols as \u201cthe most intense pain which can be experienced\u201d.

Consequently, comparing different types and degrees of pain between different patients is not easy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat hurts me may not hurt you and vice versa! Pain can be graded using scales 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible). How could anyone realistically measure the pain caused by a person having 20 broken bones? Labour pain, gallstones and kidney stones are all noted as causing severe pain. But the actual severity is very personal.\u201d\n\nIn other words, while childbirth without medication is extremely painful, the degree of that pain can\u2019t be said to \u201cequal\u201d anything \u2013 because we each have our own experience of pain.\n\nGouke also dismissed \u201cdel\u201d as the unit of measurement for pain, terming it an \u201curban myth\u201d that had been \u201ckept alive on the internet\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
