But the point that you made about chemical and biological weapons is critical. That\u2019s an issue that doesn\u2019t just concern Syria; it concerns our close allies in the region, including Israel. It concerns us. We cannot have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people. \u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.\u201d\n\nWhen The Fact Checker was a diplomatic correspondent for The Washington Post, one rule of thumb was that prepared statements should be given more weight than off-hand statements at news conferences. Prepared statements often were the result of careful staff discussions and thus generally provided a better sense of the actual policies of an administration. Of course, talking points at news conferences can also be the result of staff discussions, but they may not always be delivered correctly.\n\nIndeed, the New York Times later reported that Obama had stunned his aides with his \u201cunscripted\u201d language. The Times said that his comments were made \u201cto the surprise of some of the advisers who had attended the weekend meetings and wondered where the \u2018red line\u2019 came from. With such an evocative phrase, the president had defined his policy in a way some advisers wish they could take back.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the President said yesterday in terms of Syria, we\u2019re watching very closely the stockpile of Syrian chemical weapons; that any use or proliferation of efforts related to those chemical weapons is something that would be very serious and it would be a grave mistake. \u201cThere are important international obligations that the Syrian regime must live up to in terms of the handling of their chemical weapons. And the officials who have that responsibility will be held accountable for their actions and will be held accountable for living up to those international obligations.\u201d\n\nIn April, in a letter sent to lawmakers saying there was evidence that chemical weapons had been used in Syria, White House legislative affairs director Miguel E. Rodriguez asserted: \u201cBecause of our concern about the deteriorating situation in Syria, the president has made it clear that the use of chemical weapons \u2014 or transfer of chemical weapons to terrorist groups \u2014 is a red line for the United States of America. The Obama administration has communicated that message publicly and privately to governments around the world, including the Assad regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve also said is that the use of chemical weapons would be a game-changer not simply for the United States but for the international community. And the reason for that is that we have established international law and international norms that say when you use these kinds of weapons, you have the potential of killing massive numbers of people in the most inhumane way possible, and the proliferation risks are so significant that we don\u2019t want that genie out of the bottle. So when I said that the use of chemical weapons would be a game-changer, that wasn\u2019t unique to \u2014 that wasn\u2019t a position unique to the United States and it shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise.\u201d\n\nThis new language was first introduced by Secretary of State John F. Kerry when he testified before the Senate on Tuesday \u2014 the day before the president made his remarks in Sweden. Kerry even brought up the long-forgotten Syrian Accountability Act of 2003, which included a few lines about Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile in its preamble. However, the \u201csense of Congress\u201d barely mentions the issue; the bill was mostly about the regime\u2019s support of terrorist organizations and de facto control of Lebanon.\n\n\u201cSome have tried to suggest that the debate we\u2019re having today is about President Obama\u2019s red line. I could not more forcefully state that is just plain and simply wrong. This debate is about the world\u2019s red line. It\u2019s about humanity\u2019s red line. And it\u2019s a red line that anyone with a conscience ought to draw. \u201cThis debate is also about Congress\u2019s own red line. You, the United States Congress, agreed to the chemical weapons convention. You, the United States Congress, passed the Syria Accountability Act, which says Syria\u2019s chemical weapons are \u2014 quote, \u2018threaten the security of the Middle East and the national security interests of the United States.\u2019 \u201d", "lang": "en"}
