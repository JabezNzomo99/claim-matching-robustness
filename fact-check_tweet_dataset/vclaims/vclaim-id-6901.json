That story, posted May 6 by the website Mad World News, has been repackaged and shared across social media channels. On Facebook, users rightly flagged such a post \u2014 published on quickdailyupdates.com \u2014 as potentially false.\n\nThe fictitious headline followed Obama\u2019s interview with the actress Tracee Ellis Ross at the United State of Women Summit in Los Angeles on May 5.\n\nAbout halfway into their on-stage conversation, Ross asked Obama about young girls\u2019 dreams and whether they\u2019ve evolved over time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still at that stage where we\u2019re trying to figure out what it means to be women and what we think of ourselves, what we think of each other,\u201d Obama responded, as a video of the 40-minute talk shows. \u201cSorry, in light of this last election, I\u2019m concerned about us as women and how we think about ourselves and about each other and what\u2019s really going on.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think more about, what is going on in our heads where we let that happen, you know? So I do wonder what are young girls dreaming about if we\u2019re still there \u2014 when the most qualified person running was a woman, and look what we did instead. I mean that says something about where we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we as women are still suspicious of one another \u2026 if we still have this crazy, crazy bar for each other that we don\u2019t have for men,\u201d Obama added. \u201cIf we\u2019re still doing that today \u2026 if we\u2019re not comfortable with the notion that a woman could be our president, compared to what? \u2026 We have to have that conversation with ourselves as women.\u201d\n\nThough some of what Obama actually said appears in the Mad World News story, the piece is mostly the author\u2019s opinion and interpretation of what the former first lady said.\n\nFor example, the article says: \u201cAccording to Michelle, \u2018how did we [women] let that happen\u2019 translates into any women who voted for Trump was stupid.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not what Obama said, but the headline \u2013 \u201cAfter Michelle Says \u2018Stupid Women Elected Trump,\u2019 Melania Gives Her Nasty Surprise\u201d \u2014 falsely claims that she did.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cAfter Michelle Says \u2018Stupid Women Elected Trump,\u2019 Melania Gives Her Nasty Surprise.\u201d Quickdailyupdates.com. 7 May 2018.\n\nDiserio, Rebecca. \u201cAfter Michelle Says \u2018Stupid Women Elected Trump,\u2019 Melania Gives Her Nasty Surprise.\u201d Mad World News. 6 May 2018.\n\n\u201cHow Groups Voted 2016.\u201d Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University.
