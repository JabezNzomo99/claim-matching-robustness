The post claims that the man in the picture is Congress leader Farooq Imam Husain, who had stripped a Dalit woman in public view.\n\nMore such posts can be seen here, here and here.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found it to be misleading.\n\nWhile fact-checking for the authenticity of the picture, we came across a blog post on movies dated August 2014, which had used the same picture which talks about the movie \u2018Aurat Khilona Nahin.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the full movie is also available on YouTube and at 2 hours 11 minute, the same frame can be seen.\n\nHowever, on opening the link which put out the post against the Congress leader, we found that the article is unavailable, but the posts on social media are misleading.\n\nInterestingly, the same picture went viral in past as well claiming that the man in the picture is BSP leader Bakruddin Ansari.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707", "lang": "en"}
