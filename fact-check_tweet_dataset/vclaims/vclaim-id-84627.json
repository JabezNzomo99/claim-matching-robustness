When SP Channappa was specifically asked about the issue of celebrations and slogans raised in support of Hafeez Saeed, he stated that no evidence of such activities was found in their investigation. SP further stated that certain mischievous elements had spread this rumour because of the upcoming local body elections in this area.\n\nEarlier, Gaon Connection had spoken regarding this issue to IG Range Lucknow Jay Narayan Singh who had stated that those who had put out rumours on social media will be investigated by the Cyber Cell.\n\nWhile the right-wing groups claimed that they were in possession of videos which had evidence of the locals raising slogans in support of Hafeez Saeed, Alt News couldn\u2019t find any such videos on social media.
