The claim is false; the footage has been doctored; Pelosi\u2019s speech has been slowed down.\n\nThis video has been viewed more than two million times and shared nearly 50,000 times since being published to Facebook on May 22, 2019.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi on President Trump walking out infrastructure meeting: \u2018It was very, very, very strange.\u2019\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nIn the comment section of the post, Facebook users said that the video showed Pelosi was \u201cdrunk\u201d and \u201ca babbling mess\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of comments on the post, with the users\u2019 identities redacted:\n\nThe clip has been shared widely on social media, for example here and here on YouTube.\n\nIt was also shared here and here on Facebook, including by an account that purports to belong to US President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka.\n\nBut the Facebook ID of the account is @IvankaFC2024, while that of Ivanka Trump\u2019s verified Facebook account is @IvankaTrump.\n\nAFP analysed the footage and found that the speed and motion of the video had been slowed.\n\nThe footage shows a blue background with words on it, similar to the one at the Center for American Progress Ideas Conference, which was held in Washington DC on May 22, 2019.\n\nPelosi was one of the speakers at the conference.\n\nHer full speech, which was around 33:10 long, was published online by American cable and satellite TV network C-SPAN.\n\nThe caption of the C-SPAN video states: \u201cAt the Center for American Progress Ideas Conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) repeated her comments that she believes President Trump is \u2018obstructing justice\u2019 and is engaged in a \u2018cover up\u2019 by refusing to cooperate with investigations by House Democrats.\n\n\"She added that the president\u2019s efforts to thwart them may be an \u2018impeachable offense.\u2019 She also discussed the Democratic agenda, women\u2019s rights and health care at the event in Washington, DC.\u201d\n\nThe same part of Pelosi\u2019s speech as included in the doctored video can be viewed at around 06:09 of this C-SPAN video.\n\nHere is a transcript of that part of her speech:\n\n\u201cAnd then he had a press conference in the Rose Garden with all these... sort of visuals that obviously were planned long before I said most recently that he was engaged in a cover-up. So it\u2019s really sad. Here\u2019s the thing, and I told this to the room and he came in and made that statement and he walked out. You got the Secretary of the Treasury, this, that, and the other, distinguished group of members from the House and Senate, Democrats. Said 200 years ago Thomas Jefferson tasks his secretary of the treasury... to develop an infrastructure initiative for America to build into the Louisiana purchase, the Lewis and Clark expedition... the Cumberland Road, all those kind of things for America. 100 years later, Teddy Roosevelt instituted his infrastructure initiative, the National Park Service. The Green Initiative - the greenest infrastructure initiative in America. So I said... we want to give this president the opportunity to do something historic for our country. While there are those in our family who think - why would you work with him? You know, and basically he is saying why would I work with you if you are investigating, but the fact is something happened there. So I pray for him and I pray for the United States of America. It\u2019s really\u2026 he walked away. Whether he ever intended to honour what he said before remains to be seen, but Democrats believe in building infrastructure of our country - mass transit, roads, bridges, broadband into rural America, into underserved areas in our cities, wastewater, clean water infrastructure, the satellite so we can have precision farming. There are so many needs and we thought we had some level of agreement, but you never know with this president of the United States, so that\u2019s what happened this morning. It was very, very, very strange.\u201d\n\nAFP took a YouTube version of Pelosi\u2019s original speech uploaded by American news website NowThisNews (starting at 01:50) and slowed it down by 75 percent.\n\nAFP then took the same clip of the original speech and imported it to Anilyzer, an online tool that allows frame-by-frame analysis, and cut the speed by equal measure.\n\nBoth of the slowed versions of her speech resemble the doctored video.\n\nAccording to this Washington Post report dated May 23, 2019, Pelosi\u2019s pitch has also been altered.\n\n\u201cTo possibly correct for how that speed change would deepen her tone, the video also appears to have been altered to modify her pitch, to more closely resemble the sound of her natural speech,\u201d the Washington Post report says.\n\nWhen playing a YouTube video in slower motion, both the visuals and sound would be slowed as a result.\n\nAFP could not detect any obvious alteration specifically to the motion of the video, for example to Pelosi\u2019s blinking and hand gestures.\n\nThe doctored video is uploaded in lower definition than the original, but there is also no apparent motion blur in the slowed-down video.\n\nOn May 23, 2019, a day after the doctored clip was posted, US President Donald Trump tweeted a different video compilation which also purports to show Pelosi\u2019s slurred speech with caption: \u201cPELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE\u201d.\n\nPelosi and Trump have publicly traded barbs in recent days. Here is an AFP report on their dispute.\n\nMultiple previous misleading reports have portrayed Pelosi as sluggish or drunk. For example, the speaker was falsely accused of being drunk at a cancer fundraiser in January 2019, according Poynter-owned fact-checking PolitiFact.", "lang": "en"}
