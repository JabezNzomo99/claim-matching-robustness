While Ram Madhav has deleted this tweet, a screenshot of the same can be seen below.\n\nAccording to Indian Express, the aforesaid incident took place in the heart of Belonia town in Tripura\u2019s extreme south at 2.30 pm on Monday, 48 hours after the assembly election results were announced.\n\nWhen this issue was brought to the notice of Tathagata Roy, the Governor of Tripura, instead of condemning an act of vandalism and hooliganism responded with whataboutery, indirectly justifying the events.\n\nTathagata Roy is not new to controversy on social media. In the past, he sent out a tweet urging a Twitter user to appreciate \u2018what Hindus did in 2002\u2019.\n\nDelhi BJP Spokesperson Tajinder Bagga tweeted, \u201c\u0932\u093e\u0932 \u0917\u0941\u0932\u093e\u092e\u0940 \u091b\u094b\u0921\u093c \u0915\u0930 \u092c\u094b\u0932\u094b \u0935\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u0924\u0930\u092e\u201d with the same picture, a tweet which again comes across as celebratory in nature. Ironically, Tajinder Bagga is the founder of a right-wing organisation called \u201cBhagat Singh Kranti Sena\u201d, Bhagat Singh who was reportedly reading a book on Lenin just before he was hanged to death.\n\nFilmmaker Vivek Agnihotri meanwhile quoted a poem by Faiz Ahmad Faiz, the founder of Communist Party of Pakistan, to celebrate the falling of a statue of a Communist icon.\n\nMakarand Paranjape, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, termed this act of vandalism an \u201cAmazing spectacle\u201d, while quoting Ram Madhav\u2019s now deleted tweet.\n\nNupur Sharma, the editor of right-wing portal OpIndia, was of the opinion that such an act of vandalism was a democratic act, \u201cWith the communist\u2019s exit, their idol should go too\u201d. Can an electoral loss be a justification of demolition of iconography related to the losing party?\n\nMany people whom PM Modi follows on Twitter either celebrated the falling of the statue or defended it. Abhishek Mishra who is followed by PM Modi on Twitter suggested that the demolition of the statue should be a moment to pride and not defensiveness.\n\nThis tendency to applaud and encourage the desecration of iconography was illustrated by another BJP leader from Tamil Nadu. BJP National General Secretary H Raja tweeted that the statue of social reformer EV Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar) would be pulled down. Following an uproar, he deleted the Facebook post.\n\nThe fall of the Left in Tripura is a watershed moment for the politics of the state and the verdict of the people is probably a manifestation of the desire for change. The razing of the statue of Lenin, however, is a shameful act which deserves to be unequivocally condemned. Instead, what has been witnessed is widespread approval of such vandalism from those who are on the other end of the ideological spectrum, egged on by senior leaders of the BJP.", "lang": "en"}
