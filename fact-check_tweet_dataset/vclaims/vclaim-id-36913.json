Alcohol to be banned all over India from tonight.'\n\nIllicit liquor claimed 23 lives in Uttar Pradesh's Barabanki on May 28, 2019. Read more it here.\n\nAn archived version of the viral post can be accessed here.\n\nThe same image has also been shared on Twitter with a similar caption.\n\nBOOM looked for any order banning alcohol pan-India issued by the Central government but found none.\n\nThe only news of alcohol ban that came in recent times was that from Mizoram. The nort-eastern state that had once been a complete dry state has gone back to being an alcohol-free state from May 28.\n\nBOOM then looked at the viral post closely and found several red flags.\n\nWe ran a reverse image search on Modi's image and found that it was taken from a two year old speech on new year's eve in 2016.\n\nBelow is the video of the Modi's 'address to the nation' published on December 31, 2016.\n\nNext, we compared the fonts of the news flash and the tickers and found that the news flash was much brighter when compared to the tickers on the screen.\n\nA portion of the digital clock in the top right corner has been covered by the photoshopped text.", "lang": "en"}
