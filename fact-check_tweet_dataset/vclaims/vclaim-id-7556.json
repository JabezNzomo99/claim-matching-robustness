No, that's still not true: the story was already disproven in September 2017 but has recently gone viral again. It is not real.\n\nThe article went viral again around May 23, 2018 and was titled \"17-year-old teenager sues his parents for being born white\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nSt-Louis, MO | A 17-year-old is undertaking one of the most controversial lawsuits of the history of the country as he is suing his own biological parents for being born white.\n\nAnthony Dwight, 17, claims he has suffered his whole life from the shame of being born white. \"When I was a kid, I'd spend hours in the shower trying to wash off the white off my skin, but it would never go away,\" he recalls painfully.\n\nBack in September of 2017 we already debunked this one:\n\nIt is unclear why it suddenly became popular again.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Babysitter NOT Arrested For Auctioning Kids Under Her Care On eBay\n\u2022 Fake News: Man's Hand NOT Cut Off For Masturbating During Ramadan In Saudi Arabia\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Sue Alabama Over 1865 Document Giving Him Right To Own 'Black Slaves'\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Crash Into River After Attempting To Give Himsef Oral Sex While Driving\n\u2022 Fake News: Donald Trump NOT Bestowed Honorific Title By Association Of People With Small Hands", "lang": "en"}
