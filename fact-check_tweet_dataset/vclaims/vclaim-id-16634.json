And even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering. And then I heard that there were protests. I said, \u201cWhere are the protests? I don\u2019t see any protests.\u201d I did see a small protest today when I came \u2014 very small. So a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say. But you saw the people waving the American flag, waving your flag; it was tremendous spirit and love. There was great love. It was an alliance. And I didn\u2019t see the protestors until just a little while ago, and it was a very, very small group of people, put in for political reasons. So it was fake news.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump didn\u2019t see the mass of protestors, as he said. But that doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t exist, or that reports of such crowds are \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nUSA Today reported that \u201c[t]he protest route ran from London\u2019s Trafalgar Square, past No. 10 Downing St. \u2013 Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s official office and residence \u2013 and on to Parliament Square, a large open green space across the street from the British Parliament.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cbecause of the way British police placed security barriers,\u201d the newspaper explained, \u201c[m]ost of the demonstrators were out of his sight.\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s claims, the Guardian, a British news publication, posted a short video of interviews with some of the protestors who gathered in those locations. (It also posted a longer video of people marching and listening to speakers criticize Trump.)\n\nABC News and CNN also published stories including a video and photos of more than a \u201cvery small\u201d number of protestors holding signs with messages denouncing the president. There also was a parade-sized balloon depicting Trump as a baby, and a giant statue of Trump wearing an \u201cimpeach me\u201d hat and sitting on a toilet with a phone in his hands.\n\nNBC News reported that \u201c[t]ens of thousands of protesters assembled in the streets of London on Tuesday\u201d in what it said was the \u201clargest of more than two dozen anti-Trump protests planned around the U.K. this week.\u201d One of the groups that organized the demonstration claimed \u201csome 75,000 people\u201d attended the June 4 protest.\n\nIf so, that wouldn\u2019t even be London\u2019s largest ever gathering of Trump protesters.\n\n\u201cWhile thousands turned out, the protests were significantly smaller than the anti-Trump demonstrations that emerged during the President\u2019s visit to the U.K. last July,\u201d Time reported. The magazine said that time \u201c[a]bout 250,000 people flooded the center of London, and an estimated total of 400,000 people protested across the U.K, resulting in a large-scale police and security operation, in which more than 10,000 police officers were deployed.\u201d\n\nAs we have written before, the president has a habit of labeling accurate news stories as \u201cfake news.\u201d This is yet another example.", "lang": "en"}
