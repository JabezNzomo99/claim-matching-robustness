But a bogus story circulating online claims that it has been.\n\nFacebook users were right to flag as potentially false a story with the headline: \u201cBREAKING: FBI Executes Search Warrant At Obama D.C. Mansion.\u201d\n\nThe story originated on reaganwasright.com, which is part of a network of sites that labels its content as satire and tells readers in a disclaimer that, \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d\n\nBut stories published on those websites are often copied and reposted by sites that have no such disclaimer. That\u2019s what happened in this case.\n\nIt\u2019s been posted on at least half a dozen other websites since it was first published in September 2017. It was recently reposted on a site called kosalb.info on March 21.\n\nThe story starts with a reference to President Donald Trump\u2019s unfounded claim that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential election. The rest of it is a fictional account of an imagined FBI raid on the Obamas\u2019 home that uncovered evidence of a surveillance program.\n\nShelly Smithers, the person quoted as an FBI spokeswoman, is fictional, too. That\u2019s the name of a character in a 2013 mystery novel about the FBI.\n\nThe story also says that the FBI would release a statement about the raid, but there is no record of any such statement from the bureau.\n\nNot only was there no raid, the story doesn\u2019t even get the price of the Obamas\u2019 home correct. According to the deed and related information on file with the Office of Tax and Revenue in D.C., Homefront Holdings, LLC. (which is controlled by Barack Obama) purchased the Tudor style house in May 2017 for $8.1 million, not $8.9 million, as the false story says.\n\nAlso, the photos that appear in the bogus story have nothing to do with Obama. One shows an FBI agent carrying boxes out of a Dearborn, Michigan, home in June 2017, and the other shows a San Francisco-area mansion during a raid in 2006.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nDangremond, Samuel. \u201cSee Photos of the Obamas\u2019 New House.\u201d Town and Country Magazine. 1 Feb 2018.\n\n\u201cMichigan home raided by FBI in operation described as national security issue.\u201d Fox News. 2 Jun 2017.", "lang": "en"}
