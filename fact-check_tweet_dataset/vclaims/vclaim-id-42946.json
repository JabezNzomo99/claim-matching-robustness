While Dettol and other disinfectant products may kill the new coronavirus on surfaces, the makers of Dettol says \"under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route)\".\n\n\n\nA Facebook post shows an image claiming that Dettol spray can kill coronavirus and that it was known about in 2019. It has been shared over 10,000 times on Facebook. Another shows an image of a Dettol bottle and asks \u201cif Corona virus is so new and so dangerous how come dettol can kill it?\u201d It has been shared over 7,000 times.\n\nThe implication is that the new coronavirus observed in China is not new, or that it is not very dangerous if Dettol can kill it.\n\nBoth images are of genuine bottles of Dettol, as we\u2019ve written before, and a number of Dettol products say they are proven to kill \u201cHuman Coronavirus\u201d.\n\nBut the key point here is that coronavirus is a broad category of viruses which includes a number of different respiratory illnesses. One is the common cold, but the category also includes SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome of which there were outbreaks in 2002 and 2004), and the new coronavirus identified in Wuhan. The \u201cHuman coronavirus\u201d referred to on the Dettol bottle is not the same as the new one (recently named Covid-19 by the World Health Organisation.)\n\nThe new coronavirus has not been tested with commercial cleaning sprays yet to see whether or not it can be killed by them.\n\nAs for how dangerous the new Covid-19 virus can be, the World Health Organisation has said: \u201cAs with other respiratory illnesses, infection with [Covid-19] can cause mild symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever. It can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.\u201d\n\nThe isn\u2019t necessarily a link between how dangerous a virus is to those infected with it, and whether disinfectants are effective against it. For example, one study in Nature suggests that Dettol is effective against Ebola, although Dettol don\u2019t make that claim themselves. Covid-19 spreads primarily through person-to-person contact, such as \u201crespiratory droplets generated when a person, for example, coughs or sneezes\u201d\u2014so the most common route of infection isn\u2019t via surfaces that could be cleaned with such products.\n\nWhat has Dettol said?\n\nDettol has issued information about the Covid-19 coronavirus. It says the new virus \u201cis not yet available for commercial testing.\u201d It also claims that a number of its products have proven effective against other types of coronavirus.\n\nIt adds: \u201cGiven the structural similarities of the novel 2019-CoV virus to the coronavirus strains tested previously (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Human Coronavirus), and based on the evidence available to us, we would expect our Dettol products (listed above) to be effective against the new strain. Definitive scientific confirmation of this, as with all other commercially available virucides, can only be provided once testing against 2019-nCoV Coronavirus has been conducted, following release of the strain by relevant health authorities.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
