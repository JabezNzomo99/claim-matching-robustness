The price ranges from Rs. 6 lakh for a Hindu Brahmin girl to Rs. 3 lakh for a Jain girl and Rs. 7 lakh for a Sikh girl. It has been shared by Facebook group PROUD HINDU with the caption, \u201cShocking document. Love jihad is real. Save our Hindu daughters. Sponsored by PFI.\u201d\n\nSeveral other users have also shared the purported \u2018rate card\u2019.\n\nOn August 4, 2018, actor Koena Mitra tweeted an image of what appeared to be an extract from a newspaper, Sanjha Lokswami which advertised the same \u2018rate card\u2019 writing \u201c\u0932\u095c\u0915\u0940 \u092d\u0917\u093e\u0913 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e \u092c\u0928\u093e\u0913 \u0914\u0930 \u0907\u0928\u093e\u092e \u092a\u093e\u0913\u201d (Elope with a girl, convert her to Islam and gain a reward). Mitra\u2019s account is permanently suspended by Twitter.\n\nThe image tweeted by Mitra is photoshopped, and this particular message has been circulating on social media and on WhatsApp for several years now. Alt News found that the earliest version of this dangerous provocation is on a blog titled \u2018Sikh and Islam\u2019 published on February 5, 2010. There are a number of clues in the image posted below which prove that it is fake.\n\nFirstly, this poster has the phrase, \u201cin the name of allah\u2026\u2026most merciful, most benificiary\u201c, while the usual phrase used is \u201cIn the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful\u201c. Such a mistake would be unusual if this had actually been a pamphlet issued by an Islamic organisation. Moreover, it is the heart-shaped image at the top of the pamphlet that gives the most concrete evidence of this poster being a photoshopped one. The gun-shaped image within the heart is actually the flag of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shi\u2019a Islamist militant group. The heart-shaped image has been independently in circulation since 2006.\n\nIn June 2017, Times Now had broadcast a prime time story based on this old photoshopped picture with the claim that it was from Kerala, and with the hashtag #CaliphateConvertsHindus.\n\nThis message had also been circulated by various fake news sites like Hindutva.Info, Jagruk Bharat and Hindu Existence in February 2016 and had also featured in Saamana, the mouthpiece of the Shiv Sena in 2010.\n\nSuch inciteful content is pervasive on social media and keeps circulating at regular intervals, with the objective of keeping communalism active and relevant.", "lang": "en"}
