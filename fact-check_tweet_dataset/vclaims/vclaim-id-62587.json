Many of them are risking their lives for the sake of all of us. Does the Prime Minister think it is right that careworkers coming from abroad and working on our frontline should have to pay a surcharge of hundreds, sometimes thousands of pounds to use the NHS themselves?\u201d \u201c\u2026we must look at the realities. This is a great national service\u2014it is a national institution\u2014that needs funding, and those contributions help us to raise about \u00a3900 million.\u201d\n\nAt this week\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, Boris Johnson claimed that health surcharges paid by international care workers \u201chelp us to raise about \u00a3900 million.\u201d\n\nTo clarify, \u00a3900 million is the total amount international residents working in all sectors have paid towards the immigration health surcharge over four years, not just the amount paid by healthcare workers themselves, as might have been understood by the Prime Minister\u2019s comments.\n\nThe government has since said it will scrap the charge for international health staff and care workers.\n\nHow does the immigration health surcharge work?\n\nThe immigration health surcharge is currently paid by nationals of countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who are:\n\u2022 making a visa application to come and work, study or join family in the UK for more than six months, but not permanently,\n\u2022 living in the UK already and are making an immigration application to stay in the UK for any period of time, but not permanently.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to pay the surcharge in a number of other circumstances, for example if you\u2019re an asylum seeker, or have a family member who is an EU national.\n\nAt the moment, the surcharge costs \u00a3400 per year (with the exception of students or those coming to the UK on a youth mobility scheme for whom it costs \u00a3300).\n\nThe government plans to increase this surcharge to \u00a3624 from October 2020 and extend it so that EU and EEA nationals also have to pay it when they come to the UK. A discounted rate of \u00a3470 will apply to all under 18s.\n\nHow much is raised from healthcare workers, and in total?\n\nAnnual reports from the Home Office show that, since its introduction in 2015/16, the surcharge has raised around \u00a3920 million, with \u00a3300 million raised in 2018/19. By comparison the health spending in England in 2018/19 was around \u00a3129 billion.\n\nNewsnight reported that NHS workers (which doesn\u2019t include social care workers) contribute around \u00a335 million a year of that total, data sourced to the House of Commons Library, a service which provides briefings to MPs.\n\nThe Library told us the data behind the figure was produced for Seema Malhotra MP, but that, as responses to enquiries from MPs are confidential, it could not share the figures with Full Fact. We have asked Ms Malhotra\u2019s office to share the data.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how many healthcare workers currently pay the surcharge, and according to a parliamentary question earlier this year the Home Office does not collect that data. Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation has pointed out that there were around 88,000 non-EU international workers in the NHS in England and a further 134,000 in the adult social care sector in 2019, though added that some of these people will have permanent right to remain in the UK and so won\u2019t be paying the surcharge.", "lang": "en"}
