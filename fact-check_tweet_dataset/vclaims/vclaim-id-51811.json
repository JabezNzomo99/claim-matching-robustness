A nostalgic reunion between the two ensues. \n\n\n\nThe clip is going viral on WhatsApp and Facebook with a caption falsely identifying the man as Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\"Sunder Pichai Google CEO visiting his maths teacher after 27 years at her residence in Mysore. see humility\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90\", the text claims.\n\n\n\nBOOM got the same video on its WhatsApp helpline from several readers with a request to fact-check the clip.\n\nA verified YouTube channel Telugu Film Producers Council Official channel with more than 1 million subscribers shared the video with the same misleading caption.

An archive of the post is available here.\n\nBOOM did a keyword search with 'Ganesh Kohli,' the name band that appears at the beginning of the viral video, and the name of the teacher he mentions, 'Molly Abraham.'\n\nThe first Google search result directs you to Ganesh Kohli's website page, 'Teacher'. Kohli is the founder of the International Career and College Counseling (IC3), a company that offers school-based career and college guidance. It has a presence in the United States as well as India.\n\nKholi credits his teacher Molly Abraham for his success. An excerpt from the website says, \"Ganesh was first inspired by his Math teacher in school, Mrs. Molly Abraham. He began teaching Mathematics in 1997 for a variety of students, and over time shifted focus to preparation for standardized tests such as GRE, GMAT and SAT.\"\n\n\n\nThe page had the same video posted from IC3 Movement's YouTube channel, titled 'Molly Teacher' on Sept 1, 2017.\n\nFurther, Ganesh Kohli has clarified on his social media accounts that he was the man paying a tribute to his maths teacher in the viral video, and it is not Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google or Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft.\n\nBOOM has reached out to Kohli, who confirmed that it was him in the video. Kohli, who is based in Mumbai, told BOOM that he had studied under Molly Abraham when he was studying at SCDB high school in DN Nagar, Andheri West. Abraham moved to Mysore in 1996 after her retirement. \n\n\n\nMoreover, according to news reports by The Hindu Business Line and Mumbai Mirror, Sundar Pichai grew up in Ashoknagar, Chennai and attended school till standard X at Jawahar Vidyalaya in Chennai along with his younger brother Sreenivasan. Pichai finished his schooling in Chennai before moving on to pursue his engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, in West Bengal.", "lang": "en"}
