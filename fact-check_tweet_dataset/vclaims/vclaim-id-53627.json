Now imagine the desert of Karbala several centuries ago, where Hussain, son of Ali, and his 71 companions were killed after being kept thirsty for three days. Through his life to across his death, there was a message for mankind. Before the battle began, one of the enemy troops came across Hussain\u2019s caravan. The army commander asked Hussain for water. Hussain asked his companions to give water not only to the soldiers but to their horses too. These soldiers were here to kill him, Hussain knew that. But still he didn\u2019t refuse water. Though few days later, the same soldiers didn\u2019t allow Hussain to access the water from the Euphrates. However, inspite of the thirst, Hussain did not leave the path of truth and sacrificed his life for the good cause. He stood up against the tyrant and corrupt ruler of his times. Taking inspiration from Hussain, our volunteers in Raipur (Chhattisgarh) installed a water cooler for passengers at the Raipur railway station.
