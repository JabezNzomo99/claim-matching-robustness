This line has been removed, as it did not accurately capture the ranking system of the US army. On the same basis, the calculation of an average soldier\u2019s salary has been removed from this check and will be corrected pending comment from the US Army.\n\nFacebook posts shared tens of thousands of times claim that retired U.S. presidents are paid an annual salary of $450,000 for life, U.S. Senate and House of Representative members get $174,000 annually for life, the speaker of the House receives $223,500 annually for life, while the Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader and the House minority leader are each paid $194,400 annually for life. Meanwhile, the posts claim, the \u201caverage salary of a soldier deployed in Afghanistan\u201d is $38,000 and the \u201caverage income for seniors on Social Security\u201d is $12,000. The claims made in these posts are partly false.\n\nExamples of these posts can be seen here , here and here .\n\nU.S. code stipulates ( here ) that the U.S. president, while in office, \u201cshall receive in full for his services during the term for which he shall have been elected compensation in the aggregate amount of $400,000 a year, to be paid monthly, and in addition an expense allowance of $50,000.\u201d The $450,000 salary claim made in the posts may come from the sum of these two amounts.\n\nIn addition, the president is given $100,000 each year for travel and $19,000 for entertainment, according to CNBC ( here ).\n\nUpon leaving office, ex-presidents have an annual pension of $200,000, plus paid official travel and healthcare coverage, according to media reports ( here ). As reported here by Business Insider, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton received annual pensions of $205,700 in 2016. In 2017, Barack Obama received $207,800, according to GoBankingRates ( here ).\n\nThere is also ample opportunity for former presidents to profit from high-paid speaking engagements and lucrative book deals. In 2015, for example, Politico reported that former President George W. Bush had given at least 200 paid speeches since leaving office, typically making $100,000 to $175,000 per appearance ( here ).\n\nAlso in 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that former President Bill Clinton and former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had earned more than $30 million combined in the 16 months prior, with $25 million from paid speeches. ( here ).\n\nWhile still in office, President Barack Obama earned $15.6 million between 2005 and 2016 in advances and royalties from his bestselling books \"The Audacity of Hope\", \"Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters\u201d and \"Dreams From My Father,\" Forbes has reported ( here ).\n\nIn 2017, the Los Angeles Times reported that Obama was making $400,000 per speech ( here ). The same year, he and former First Lady Michelle Obama both signed book deals worth at least $60 million ( here ).\n\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-profit, nonpartisan group that tracks the role of money and lobbying in elections and public policy, President Donald Trump had reported earning $2.3 billion from business ventures and investments between announcing his presidential run in the summer of 2015 and the spring of 2019 ( here ). Trump donates the equivalent of a quarter of his presidential salary each quarter, but continues to earn income from his real estate holdings ( here ).\n\nSince 2009, the annual salary for a U.S. senator has indeed been $174,000 ( here ). As stated on the official Senate website, since the early 1980s, \u201cSenate leaders\u2013majority and minority leaders\u2026 have received higher salaries than other members. Currently, leaders earn $193,400 per year.\u201d\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives also receive $174,000, while the House majority leader and the minority leader each receive $193,400 ( see page 9 here ). The speaker of the House earns $223,500 annually.\n\nPENSIONS FOR FORMER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS\n\nAs explained here in the summary section of a 2019 Senate paper on retirement benefits for members of Congress, \u201cCongressional pensions, like those of other federal employees, are financed through a combination of employee and employer contributions.\u201d\n\nDepending on when they were elected to Congress, former senators and representatives are covered by one of four different pension arrangements: 1) the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Social Security 2) The CSRS Offset plan, which includes both CSRS and Social Security, but with CSRS contributions and benefits reduced by Social Security contributions and benefits 3) The Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System Act (FERS), which includes the FERS basic retirement annuity, Social Security, and Thrift Savings Plan 4) Social Security alone ( here ).\n\nThese four arrangements stipulate different age and length of service requirements for post-retirement pensions, described in detail on pages 4 through 6 here .\n\nAs explained here in an April 2020 PolitiFact article, the youngest age at which a retired lawmaker can begin receiving a pension is 50.\n\n\u201cEven for the longest-serving lawmakers,\u201d PolitiFact says, \u201cfederal law caps pensions at 80% of full salary,\u201d contrary to the social media posts\u2019 claims that members of Congress and congressional leaders receive pensions equal to their salaries \u201cfor life.\u201d\n\nAs is the case for presidents and former presidents, members of Congress both past and present have sources of income beyond federal salaries and pensions. As reported by The Atlantic in 2014, \u201cmore than 150 lawmakers reported earning more from outside investments than from the congressional salary\u201d in 2010 ( here ).\n\nAccording to the House Committee on Ethics, House members \u201care subject to a number of\u2026 restrictions on their outside employment (See Chapter 5 here ).\n\nHonoraria (payments for appearances, speeches, or op-eds) are limited, or, in some cases, prohibited for House reps (see page 189 here ). A condensed guide to restrictions on outside employment for members of the House can be found here .\n\nCompensation for an active-duty U.S. Army soldier depends on rank and experience. While a private with fewer than two years of experience may earn $20,170.80, a staff sergeant with more than six years of experience can earn $39,049.20 ( here ) .\n\nReuters contacted the US Army to ask the average salary of a soldier deployed in Afganistan, but had not received a response at the time of this check\u2019s update.\n\nAccording to the Social Security Administration\u2019s fact sheet for 2020 ( here ), retired workers currently receive on average $1,503 a month in Social Security benefits. This totals to $18,036 a year, over $6,000 higher than the posts claim.\n\nIn 2016, when some of these posts originated, the weekly average for retired workers was $1,342 a month, or $16,104 a year (see page 16 here ).\n\nPartly false. Presidents and members of Congress do not receive these salaries \u201cfor life.\u201d Retired Social Security recipients receive more than the amount listed in the posts.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
