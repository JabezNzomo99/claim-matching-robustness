A set of images of an abnormal newborn child is now viral. It has been shared with the claim that the baby was born in Garoth village and her mother died after giving birth. The claim further adds that the child started speaking within one hour of her birth and said, \u201cIf you sleep tonight, you will sleep forever.\u201d\n\nFrom the Facebook profile of one Khan Ajaz, the images have drawn 4,400 shares. The complete message reads, \u201c\u0906\u091c \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u0941\u0930\u0940 \u0916\u092c\u0930 \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0920 \u0917\u093e\u0902\u0935 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u090f\u0915 \u0932\u0921\u093c\u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u093f\u0938\u0915\u0940 1 \u0918\u0902\u091f\u093e \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u0941\u0906 \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u0939 \u092c\u094b\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u093f \u091c\u094b \u0938\u094b \u0917\u090f \u0935\u0939 \u0938\u094b \u0917\u090f \u0914\u0930 \u091c\u094b \u091c\u0917 \u0917\u090f \u091c\u094b \u091c\u0917 \u0917\u090f \u0914\u0930 \u0909\u0938\u0915\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0924\u094b \u092e\u0930 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0948.\u201d\n\nA Twitter user @HindustaniRia_ shared a video of the baby and wrote that she was born in Rajasthan and died two hours after birth.\n\nAlt News has received multiple requests on its mobile application to fact-check the claim.\n\nAlt News found that the viral claim is false. In one of the images, a board reads \u201c\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0928\u0926\u094d\u0930\u201d (health centre, Kalandri) and in the video, a woman can be heard speaking Rajasthani. Taking these as clues, we found that a health centre is located in Sirohi district\u2019s Kalandri in Rajasthan. Upon speaking with the centre\u2019s doctor S Bhati, we discovered that he is the one photographed in the viral images.\n\n\u201cYes, I am the doctor in the photographs. The child was born dead and the mother is still alive,\u201d he informed Alt News. Speaking about the child\u2019s condition he said, \u201cSuch kids have a deficiency of folic acid hence their growth is abnormal. The medical term for the condition is \u2018Anencephaly\u2019 and it hampers the growth of the brain\u2019s neural tube. Sometimes, babies also develop water clots on the back of their bodies.\u201d\n\nMore information about Anencephaly is available on the website of US public health institute Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nDr Bhati also sent us videos where he gives details of the incident.\n\nTherefore, images and videos of a newborn baby who died suffering from a birth defect where parts of the brain and skull do not fully develop were shared with false claims. The assertion that the baby started talking after birth and warned that people who fall asleep will go on an eternal sleep is absurd, to put it lightly.\n\nPhotographs and videos of the baby are viral on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nLocal channel Udaipur News and YouTube channel Jio News TV also shared the video of the incident. They claimed that the abnormal child was born in Udaipur\u2019s Gogunda.\n\nIn the past, Alt News had debunked a video of a baby born with the genetic disorder Cyclopia shared as the advent of \u2018antichrist\u2019 born in Israel. Another video of a baby suffering from a rare genetic disorder was shared as \u2018demon\u2019 baby born in Assam.", "lang": "en"}
