Soon after, a video of Prime Minister Narendra Modi watching the live broadcast of the meet on a big screen started doing the rounds on social media.\n\nThe 44-second-long video was shared by Facebook page 'Tangi Pti Official'.\n\nA logo of news agency ANI can be seen in the video. Till the time of filing this story, the video has already been viewed more than 22 lakh times and shared over 94,000 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the video to be fake.\n\n\n\nUsing InVID tool, we broke down the video in key frames and reverse searched the images. We found that the actual video is of PM Modi watching live the launch of Chandrayaan-2 on July 22. Instead of the satellite launch, the video of Imran Khan meeting Donald Trump has been super-imposed on the big screen in the fake video.\n\nOn July 22, Donald Trump met Imran Khan at the Oval office. Chandrayaan-2 was launched on the same day.\n\nThe original ANI tweet of PM Modi watching live the launch of Chandrayaan-2 can be seen here.\n\nTherefore, it can be definitely said that the video of Modi watching live the meeting between Imran Khan and Donald Trump is fake. The PM was actually watching the launch of Chandrayaan-2, India's second lunar exploration mission after Chandrayaan-1.", "lang": "en"}
