But there\u2019s still no evidence that he said, \u201cMy mother raised me with no help from the government.\u201d\n\nIn November 2015, Ben Carson briefly led the polls for candidates seeking the Republican nomination for president.\n\nNow that he\u2019s the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a meme from his days as a candidate is circulating again on Facebook. The meme claims that on Nov. 7, 2015, Carson said: \u201cMy mother raised me with no help from the government. We had food stamps and welfare and Section 8 housing, but we made it on our own.\u201d\n\nMany of those posting it now are doing so in defense of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, adding the observation: \u201cAnd conservatives want to laugh at AOC?\u201d\n\nCarson wrote in his 1990 autobiography, Gifted Hands, that his family relied on government assistance, specifically food stamps, for a time when he was growing up. But there is no evidence in the public record that Carson said what the meme claims.\n\nNov. 7, 2015, was a Saturday; Carson sent one tweet that day, but it was about donations to his campaign. The only extensive comments we found him making were in an interview taped that night for a segment that aired on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d the next morning. In that interview, Carson answered questions about his claims of being a violent teen and being offered admission to West Point. He did not talk about food stamps and public housing, as the meme claims.\n\nActually, an early version of the Carson meme included the web address of a now-defunct Facebook page that described its content as political \u201csatire and parody.\u201d That indicates the meme was never meant to be taken seriously in the first place.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nNBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cBen Carson Answers Questions on His Past.\u201d NBCnews.com. 7 Nov 2015.\n\nCarson, Ben (@RealBenCarson). \u201cWe the People have made 10,000 donations each day this week, raising $3.5M this week alone. Thank you biased media.\u201d Twitter. 7 Nov 2015.", "lang": "en"}
