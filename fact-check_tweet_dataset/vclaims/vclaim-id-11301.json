It is possible that this accusation was based off of confusion regarding Nike\u2019s \u201celephant print\u201d shoes. \u201cElephant print,\u201d however, refers to the design on the sneaker and not the material.\n\nThe only other reference we could uncover regarding Nike and elephants occurred when the company made a shoe for an elephant, not from one:\n\nSeveral years ago, Nike learned of an elephant that had one leg shorter than the others. To help the elephant find its balance, Nike manufactured this massive leather shoe, complete with laces and buckles at the heel. The elephant was fitted for the shoe using lifts. Pink remnants on the sides are what\u2019s left from the Swoosh logos that used to adorn the sides.\n\nOn 28 April 2016, Facebook user Jason Gunn Burton, who originally posted the \u201cJust Boycott It\u201d message, added some additional information about Nike\u2019s alleged elephant skin shoes. A recent BBC report into the \u201csuper-rich\u2019s insatiable appetite for luxury goods\u201d highlighted a sneaker that really was made with the hide of an elephant:\n\nThis shoe, however, was not created by Nike. The sneakers were designed by PMK Customs (a high-end sneaker customization company originally called \u201cPimp My Kicks\u201d) and made from an Air Jordan 1, which was then retrofitted with several different animal skins. The shoes, dubbed the \u201cBrooklyn Zoos,\u201d feature elephant, stingray, lizard, crocodile, ostrich hides, and can fetch up to $20,000. PMK Customs does work with the Nike brand (and others) as well, but neither Nike nor any other brand has a say in how the shoes are altered.", "lang": "en"}
