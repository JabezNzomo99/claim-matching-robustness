However, the video was from October 2019 and had nothing to do with either group. New York police said the man in the video was charged in connection to the incident. According to local news reports, he had a long history of arrests related to New York City public transportation.\n\nTrump retweeted the group TDN_NOTICIAS, a Spanish-language account that appears to have an anti-Biden, pro-Trump slant. The video was originally posted by the account \u201cI\u2019m with Groyper.\u201d According to the Anti-Defamation League, \u201cgroypers\u201d are associated with the alt-right and supporters of white supremacists. CNN contacted the user and said he \u201cidentified himself as an advocate of White people creating their own \u2018nations\u2019 for supposed \u2018protection\u2019 from racial minorities.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump tweeted the video, Twitter suspended the \u201cI\u2019m with Groyper\u201d account for spam and platform manipulation and the video eventually disappeared from Trump\u2019s tweet. More than 35,000 people tweeted or liked Trump\u2019s tweet. By Monday morning, the video appeared to have had more than 650,000 views.\n\nMoreover, this was not the first time Trump shared this exact video in connection to the protests that have erupted across the country this summer. He shared a tweet in June that included the video and said \u201cThe invention of the cell phone now records gratuitous violence everywhere. Where are the protests for this?\u201d Trump added, \u201cSo terrible!\u201d (This video did not come from the same account as \u201cI\u2019m with Groyper.\u201d)\n\nIn June, Trump also promoted other videos on Twitter showing Black men attacking White people. A Southern Poverty Law Center 2018 study found that sharing false information about Black-on-White crime statistics is a trademark of white-supremacist thinking and websites. And Trump critics have noted that his tweets in the context of the recent protests imply crimes by Black men are equivalent to the systematic police violence against people of color.\n\nA White House official, who asked not to be identified, said: \u201cThe President simply retweeted a video, which is not an endorsement of the content or the account. President Trump will always condemn violence in all forms, especially the recent uptick in violence we\u2019ve seen in Democrat-run cities across the country.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s retweet from Sunday is a clear example of misrepresentation. As outlined in The Fact Checker\u2019s guide to manipulated video, \u201cpresenting unaltered video in an inaccurate manner misrepresents the footage and misleads the viewer. Using incorrect dates or locations are examples of subverting context.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Twitter bio does not state \u201cRetweets are not endorsements.\u201d He is responsible for the content he retweets to his more than 85 million followers. Retweeting racially charged misinformation from the account of a self-declared white nationalist does not reflect well on his allegiances during the nation\u2019s reckoning on race.", "lang": "en"}
