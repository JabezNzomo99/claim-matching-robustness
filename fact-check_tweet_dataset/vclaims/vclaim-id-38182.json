And they said, \u2018He asked. He asked for help.\u2019 Right?\"\n\n\"Russia, if you're listening\u2026 A very famous \u2014 they cut that thing so quick at the end because they didn't want to hear the laughter in the place and me laughing. It was just \u2018boom.\u2019 These are really dishonest people.\"\n\nJust like at the 2019 CPAC, where he used a similar line, Trump was not being honest about what happened July 27, 2016, at his Doral, Fla., resort.\n\nWhat Trump said at his July 2016 press conference in Doral about Russia\n\nTrump\u2019s retelling made it sound like the Russia line happened at a big rally with \"25,000 people.\" But it emerged during a one-hour press conference at his Doral resort.\n\nTrump talked about Clinton\u2019s emails several times, and at no point did he indicate he was joking. (That excuse was televised the next day.)\n\n\"Russia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" Trump told a roomful of TV cameras and reporters (including this fact-checker). \"I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let\u2019s see if that happens.\"\n\nTrump delivered his comment (around minute 13:30 on the C-SPAN video) with a straight face. We didn\u2019t hear any laughter after what he said; it was news. The Q&A continued with Trump calling on a reporter who asked about the minimum wage.\n\nIn the same press conference, Trump said, \"By the way, they hacked \u2014 they probably have her 33,000 emails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 emails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.\"\n\nAnd when NBC reporter Katy Tur asked whether he was encouraging a foreign country to hack into emails, he said, \"Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.\"\n\nTrump tweeted a similar statement after the news conference (with still no trace of an LOL).\n\nTrump cast the comment as a joke later in the day, amid criticism of his request. Fox News\u2019 Brian Kilmeade interviewed Trump the same day for a segment to run the next morning on \"Fox and Friends.\" He asked Trump, \"Were you being sarcastic?\"\n\nTrump replied: \"Of course, I'm being sarcastic.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s response caught on with supporters Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich who said the media missed the joke.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to know what was going through Trump\u2019s mind when he made the comment. Our job is to look for whether people laughed, and whether the media deceptively left that out (and neither happened).\n\nThe same day as Trump\u2019s press conference, Russians launched their first email spear-phishing campaign of emails used by Clinton\u2019s personal office.\n\nTrump said the media distorted his \"Russia, if you\u2019re listening\" comment in 2016 by cutting out \"the laugher, the joke.\"\n\nThe laughter was not cut. The full video shows that no laughter followed.\n\nTrump has recast the delivery and response of his 2016 press conference in an effort to distort the media\u2019s coverage. We rate this statement False.", "lang": "en"}
