But while Baio, Nugent, Sabato, and Diamond and Silk are all supporters of Trump, the Trump campaign has not officially announced this lineup of speakers at the convention.\n\nMike Sington, the Twitter user who originally posted this message, confirmed to The Associated Press that this tweet was intended to be a joke.\n\nThe Trump War Room, a Twitter account managed by the president\u2019s campaign, labeled the message as \u201cfake news\u201d:\n\nThe schedule for the 2020 Republican National Convention has undergone some changes this year, in large part because of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. The convention was scheduled for Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Jacksonville, Florida, but the Florida portion of event has been canceled.\n\nAs of this writing, a pared-down version of the convention will still take place in Charlotte, but much of the event is expected to take place online. The RNC has not announced a list of guest speakers for the event, and Trump is expected to only make a virtual appearance:\n\nOn Thursday President Trump abruptly canceled the four days of celebratory pomp and speeches in Jacksonville, scheduled to take place in just a month. He cited the dangers of the coronavirus, which is surging in Florida. GOP officials confirmed Friday that the shorter business portion of the event will still take place in Charlotte on August 24. That includes the actual nominations of the president and vice president. Trump is not expected to be in Charlotte. In Thursday\u2019s announcement, he said he could do \u201ctele-rallies.\u201d A GOP official said organizers are still planning four nights of convention programming, even virtual, though details aren\u2019t final.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic National Convention is also expected to be a largely virtual affair.\n\nAlthough the RNC has not announced that Nugent, Baio, Sabato, or Diamond and Silk would be speaking at the 2020 RNC \u2014 as of this writing, no announcements concerning guest speakers have been made \u2014 this fictional lineup isn\u2019t far-fetched. Baio and Sabato both spoke at the 2016 RNC.", "lang": "en"}
