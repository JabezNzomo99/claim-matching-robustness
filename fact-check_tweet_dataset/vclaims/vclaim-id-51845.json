The clip dates back to August 2019.\n\nThe search results showed that the same video was uploaded on November 4, 2019, on this website which shows that it is not a recent video as is being claimed.\n\nOn searching for clues in the video, we noticed the green carpet on the floor and men in skull caps standing around which made us guess that the place could be a mosque.\n\nWe then looked for the phrase 'naked man in mosque' on YouTube and found a longer video with the caption that said the video was from Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nThe 2.48 minutes YouTube video was uploaded on August 25, 2019, by a channel Top Trends with the caption, \"Naked man entered in Mosque, Gulshan e Hadeed Karachi\".\n\nIn the longer version of the video, a person is following the naked man on his bike before the man enters the mosque. The description of the video when translated from Urdu reads, \"An unidentified man broke into the Khalid Bin Walid mosque of the Ahl-e-Hadith school district on Gulshan-e-Hadid Phase 2 Double Road and the imam's place lay down after the glasses were damaged.\" \n\n\n\nOn searching with the same caption in Urdu, we found an older video dated August 23, 2019, on a Facebook page Pakistan Today Webtv, which stated that the naked man was identified as Shafiq Abro after being arrested by Steel Town Police, Karachi and according to reports, he is mentally ill.\n\nWe searched with the Urdu caption (\u06a9\u0631\u0627\u0686\u06cc : \u06af\u0644\u0634\u0646 \u062d\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0641\u06cc\u0632 \u0679\u0648 \u06a9\u06cc \u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u06cc\u06a9 \u067e\u0627\u06af\u0644 \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u06a9\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0691 \u067e\u06be\u0648\u0691) from the Facebook post and found that multiple small Pakistani news pages had posted the viral video.\n\nWe also found another video which shows the same man covered in blood and flies lying in the back of a pickup van. The man appeared to be in a delirious state. Alt News had previously debunked this false claim.\n\nThe video is the latest in a series of misinformation targeting the Muslim community in India after several people who took part in a religious congregation of the Tabligh-e-Jamaat''s Markaz in Delhi earlier last month, tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Video Of Eatery Staff Blowing Into Food Packets Is Not From India\n\nThe event which lasted a few weeks in early March and which ended before a total lockdown was announced on March 24, saw attendees from outside India. The event continued despite restrictions on large gatherings and movement of people in many parts of the country. The organisers of the gathering are now under fire from the Indian government and the mainstream media.", "lang": "en"}
