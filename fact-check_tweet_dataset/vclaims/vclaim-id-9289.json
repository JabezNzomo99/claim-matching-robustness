But from the get-go, Western governments and Syrian opposition activists said Russia was primarily targeting not IS, but rather other rebel groups opposed to the regime. These have included some backed by the United States and its allies, who by the start of Russia\u2019s intervention were one year into their own air campaign targeting IS forces in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSix months into Russia\u2019s air campaign, rights groups said its strikes had killed more than 1,700 civilians, amid allegations that Moscow\u2019s planes had deliberately targeted hospitals and other civilian areas.\n\nThe most recent tally by the Syrian Network says 2,704 civilians have been killed by Russian air strikes. The Syrian Observatory puts the number higher, at 3,089 fatalities.\n\nTo be sure, strikes by the U.S.-led coalition have caused civilian deaths too -- more than 1,500 in the two years since the coalition launched its operation against IS in Iraq in August 2014 and Syria the following month, according to Airwars.\n\nU.S. Central Command has acknowledged a total of 55 civilian fatalities.", "lang": "en"}
