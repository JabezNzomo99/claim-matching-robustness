The video is shot by a photographer and videographer who had then told BOOM that the video shows a sand bar in Ponnani beach and is not the Ram Setu near Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu. We had also reached out to Anwar Sadath, Tehsildar (Revenue office), Ponnani Taluk who told us that the stretch was not solid land but a sand bed and added that the phenomena is not rare and happens every year.", "lang": "en"}
