Because the details of the story are murky and based in part on anonymous sources, we won\u2019t put any claims to the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nInstead, we\u2019ll explain what we knew previously, what new information has come to light, and what we still don\u2019t know.\n\nWhat we knew before\n\nThis complex tale involves a company with significant U.S. uranium assets, the Clinton Foundation, and a decision by several federal agencies to allow greater Russian influence in the United States\u2019 uranium market.\n\nIt first emerged in the book Clinton Cash, a 2015 investigation by Breitbart News senior editor-at-large Peter Schweizer. The book looked into donations to the Clinton Foundation; an April 2015 New York Times article also documented the connections.\n\nIn 2007, Frank Giustra, a donor to the Clinton Foundation, sold his company, UrAsia, to another company, Uranium One, and unloaded his personal stake in it. The combined company kept Uranium One as its name but Toronto as its base. Under the terms of the deal, the shareholders of UrAsia retained a 60 percent stake in the new company.\n\nUranium One had mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity. Its actual production is a smaller portion of uranium produced in the United States, at 11 percent in 2014, according to Oilprice.com.\n\nIn 2009, Russia\u2019s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, bought a 17 percent share of Uranium One. In 2010, Rosatom sought to secure enough shares to give it a 51 percent stake.\n\nOn the one hand, Russia doesn\u2019t have a license to export uranium outside the United States, so, as Oilprice.com noted, \"it\u2019s somewhat disingenuous to say this uranium is now Russia\u2019s, to do with what it pleases.\"\n\nThat said, the possibility that a foreign entity would take a majority stake in the uranium operation meant that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, had to approve the deal. So did the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Utah\u2019s nuclear regulator.\n\nThe membership of CFIUS includes the State Department, meaning that the Secretary of State would have had a voice. The panel also includes the attorney general and the secretaries of the Treasury (who chairs the committee), Defense, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security, as well as the heads of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nCFIUS did approve the proposal, and in 2013, Russia assumed 100 percent ownership of Uranium One and renamed the company Uranium One Holding.\n\nWhy would the United States allow the transfer of a uranium company?\n\nAs others, including a New York Times\u2019 investigation, have suggested, the United States was still seeking to \"reset\" its relationship with Russia and trying to get the Kremlin on board with its Iran nuclear deal. But another factor may have been that, at the end of the day, the Russian deal wasn\u2019t that big.\n\nRussia\u2019s purchase of the company \"had as much of an impact on national security as it would have if they set the money on fire,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute and former director at the New America Foundation, in an interview with PolitiFact last year. \"That\u2019s probably why (CFIUS and the NRC) approved it.\"\n\nWhy some of the critics\u2019 charges during the campaign went too far\n\nIn June 2016, we fact-checked a statement by then-candidate Donald Trump -- who was running against Clinton for president -- that Clinton\u2019s State Department \"approved the transfer of 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.\"\n\nWe gave the statement a rating of Mostly False. While the connections between the Clinton Foundation and the Russian deal may appear fishy, there was simply no proof of any quid pro quo.\n\nTrump\u2019s allegation went too far in two ways.\n\nOne, Trump seemed to say that Clinton bears all of the responsibility for the deal\u2019s approval. That is incorrect.\n\nClinton told a New Hampshire TV station in June 2015 that \"I was not personally involved because that wasn\u2019t something the secretary of state did.\" And Jose Fernandez, who served as assistant secretary of state for economic, energy and business affairs under Clinton and represented the department on the panel, told the Times that Clinton \"never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter.\"\n\nBut even if you don\u2019t take either Clinton or Fernandez at their word, the reality is that the State Department was just one of nine government agencies that signed off on the transaction.\n\nSecond, while we concluded that nine people related to the company did at some point donate to the Clinton Foundation, we found that the bulk of the $145 million came from Giustra. Guistra said he sold all of his stakes in Uranium One in the fall of 2007, \"at least 18 months before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state\" and three years before the Russian deal.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t independently verify Giustra\u2019s claim, but if he is telling the truth, the donation amount to the Clinton Foundation from confirmed Uranium One investors drops from more than $145 million to $4 million.\n\nThe main exception is Ian Telfer, an investor who the New York Times found donated between $1.3 million and $5.6 million to the Clinton Foundation during and after the review process for the Russian deal.\n\nSo while Trump was within his right to question links between foundation donors and their ties to Uranium one, his specific charge was exaggerated.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington Post Fact Checker subsequently looked at a similar Trump statement: \"Remember that Hillary Clinton gave Russia 20 percent of American uranium and, you know, she was paid a fortune. You know, they got a tremendous amount of money.\"\n\nThe Fact Checker came to the same conclusion about Trump\u2019s misleading language, giving Trump\u2019s assertion its worst rating of Four Pinocchios.\n\nWhy this story is coming up again\n\nAfter Trump won the presidency, the Uranium One story received relatively little attention -- perhaps because Clinton is now a private citizen rather than serving as president. But that changed in the wake of a report published in the Hill newspaper on Oct. 17, 2017.\n\nThe article\u2019s key finding was that by the time CFIUS was weighing the deal, the FBI had been investigating whether Russia was trying to gain influence in the U.S. nuclear industry. The report said that the FBI has already \"gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin\u2019s atomic energy business inside the United States.\"\n\nThe implication of the Hill article is that Clinton either did know, or should have known, about problems with the Russian bid for Uranium One before deciding whether to let it go forward. (Clinton, the FBI and the Justice Department did not provide a comment on this story.)\n\nThe article cited FBI, Energy Department and court documents showing that the FBI had gathered \"substantial evidence well before the committee\u2019s decision that Vadim Mikerin \u2014 the main Russian overseeing Putin\u2019s nuclear expansion inside the United States \u2014 was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.\"\n\nHowever, rather than bringing immediate charges in 2010, the article said, the Justice Department \"continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin\u2019s commercial nuclear ambitions.\"\n\nWhat remains unclear after the newest report?\n\nThe relevance of the Hill report for Clinton\u2019s role would be whether she knew anything about this investigation at a time when she could have used her role in CFIUS to block the Russian deal. (It could also be relevant for the actions by then-Attorney General Eric Holder, whose department has a seat on CFIUS.)\n\nFor now at least, we aren\u2019t aware of any evidence that Clinton knew anything about the FBI investigation. If anything, the Hill\u2019s reporting suggests the opposite.\n\nThe Hill article quoted Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, saying that he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin\u2019s case.\n\n\" \u2018I had no idea this case was being conducted,\u2019 a surprised Hosko said in an interview,\" the Hill article reported.\n\nAt least one key lawmaker -- then-Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who chaired the House Intelligence Committee at the time -- also said he did not know about the investigation.\n\nIf the assistant FBI director at the time knew nothing of the investigation, then Clinton -- someone in a different department and several rungs higher in the organizational chart -- might not have known about it.\n\nStewart A. Baker, a partner at the law firm Steptoe & Johnson, was skeptical that such information would have reached the Secretary of State -- \"at least not until she was asked to weigh in on the transaction, and that would only happen if it were deeply controversial, which it was not. In my experience, the State Department was always one of the quickest agencies to urge approval of a deal, and they did that without checking with the Secretary.\"\n\nThe vast majority of cases that CFIUS reviews are handled by lower-ranking staffers and appointees, added Stephen Heifetz, a partner at the law firm Steptoe & Johnson who specializes in CFIUS law.\n\n\"Even though the heads of the CFIUS agencies comprise CFIUS as a matter of law,\" he said, \"it is relatively rare to have a cabinet secretary directly involved in a CFIUS case.\"\n\nThat said, several experts said they were surprised that word had not filtered up from the FBI.\n\nThe FBI \"is well represented as part of the Justice Department\u2019s CFIUS team,\" Baker said. \"It would be somewhat surprising to me if a company was under scrutiny as a buyer in CFIUS and simultaneously under investigation for criminal behavior by the FBI, but the criminal investigation was not known to the FBI\u2019s representatives on CFIUS.\"\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s Justice Department policy to consolidate all Foreign Corrupt Practices Act inquiries within department headquarters in Washington, said Michael Koehler, a professor at Southern Illinois University School of Law and an expert on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This makes word of those cases more likely to reach top officials than other types of investigations.\n\nAnd the fact that the Mikerin case included a confidential informant makes it \"more likely than not that top Justice Department or FBI officials either knew of the inquiry or should have known of the inquiry,\" Koehler said.\n\nEven if word had filtered up to CFIUS this way, it might not have been enough to scuttle the deal, Heifetz added.\n\n\"CFIUS often has cleared transactions when there is adverse information about foreign investors but no apparent risk to national security,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, we don\u2019t know enough to be able to say whether the apparent lack of information about the FBI investigation among higher ups was due to internal reporting failures or the more mundane reality that ground-level FBI investigations take time to mature and solidify.\n\nBut for now, there isn\u2019t enough evidence to suggest that Clinton\u2019s actions -- ill-advised as they might have been -- were any more problematic than it seemed they were a year ago.", "lang": "en"}
