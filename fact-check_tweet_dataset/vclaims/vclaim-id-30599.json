Mitt Romney was the only Republcan to vote to convict President Donald Trump of abuse of power. Attorney General William Barr appeared to acknowledge that on Twitter on Feb. 5, at least if you saw this Facebook post.\n\nThe Feb. 6 post features a screenshot of tweet from \"A.G. William Barr,\" whose Twitter handle is @AGWilliamBarr.\n\n\"BREAKING NEWS,\" the Feb. 5 tweet says, \"Senator Mitt Romney is the only Republican Senator who voted to remove President Trump from office\u2026 IN A COMPLETELY UNRELATED STORY Senator Mitt Romney is also the only Republican Senator who has a son who sits on the board of a Ukrainian Energy Company.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe tweet is real, but the account doesn\u2019t belong to Barr. What\u2019s not clear from the Facebook post is that @AGWilliamBarr is a parody account.\n\n\"The Official PARODY Account of the Attorney General with the USA,\" the Twitter bio says. \"Followed by Corn Pop, Blocked by Pierre Delecto & RT\u2019d by Right Wing Conspiracy Theorists.\"\n\nAs for whether Romney has a son on the board of a \"Ukrainian Energy Company,\" we\u2019ve already fact-checked that. There\u2019s no evidence any of his sons have served on the board of any energy company with ties to Ukraine.", "lang": "en"}
