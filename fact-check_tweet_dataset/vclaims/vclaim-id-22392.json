RIA Novosti claims that the small volumes of American LNG coming from the U.S. are political pressure and constitute a \u201cgas war\u201d against Moscow, even as the state-owned news agency attempts to belittle the U.S. natural gas industry.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "August 27, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-22392", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-accuses-usa-of-waging-gas-war-in-europe/29455949.html", "vclaim": "Cheniere Energy\u2019s LNG plant, with 27 million tons per year nameplate capacity at the Sabine Pass River on the Louisiana-Texas border, was commissioned in 2016 and was the first of its kind in the U.S. Dominion Energy\u2019s Cove Point plant on the Chesapeake Bay, which can produce 5.25 million tons of LNG per year, started to stream last month. At least four more natural gas liquidation facilities are set to start operating in the coming months, and dozens of companies have submitted long-term application forms for LNG exports with the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that the country\u2019s liquefied natural gas exports had increased to 2.8 billion cubic feet per day as of November 2017. That followed the completion of the fourth liquefaction unit at the Sabine Pass terminal, which has the largest capacity in the lower 48 states.\n\nBrussels\u2019s and Washington\u2019s efforts to open and diversify the natural gas market in Europe are perceived by some Russian observers as a \u201cgas war\u201d being waged by the U.S. against Moscow.\n\nHowever, the demand for de-monopolization and diversification of the market is a requirement of the European Union\u2019s Third Energy Package, which stipulates separation of companies\u2019 production and sale operations from their transport networks.\n\nRussia's state-controlled energy giant Gazprom has consistently pushed to increase the volumes of its natural gas deliveries to Europe, by building the Turkish Stream pipeline in southern Europe through the Black Sea and by pressing affected countries to permit the construction of Nord Stream 2, the second edition of the disputed pipeline under the Baltic Sea. All of this violates the Third Energy Package.\n\nThe first edition of Nord Stream, both lines of which were completed in 2011, was actually built to circumvent any land transit for Russian gas through the Baltic states and Poland, therefore directly influencing the supply of gas to Western Europe. Currently, at least a third of Europe\u2019s gas comes from Russia, and Gazprom\u2019s shipments to the continent reached a record high last year and are only expected to grow.\n\nIn 2011, the energy package was already in force, and merely inaugurating the Nord Stream pipeline violated EU laws. Gazprom, the majority owner of North Stream AG, the operator of the pipeline, is actually the sole producer, seller and transporter of the gas.\n\nHowever, while the launch of Nord Stream violated EU law, protests by officials in Poland and the Baltic countries were futile at that time, given that Moscow was playing energy geopolitics, with Gazprom signing one-on-one gas deals with many EU member states.\n\nOver the course of natural gas payment disputes with Kyiv, Russia interrupted the supply of gas to Ukraine and Ukraine\u2019s EU neighbors on at least three occasions between 2009 and 2011. The Russian government-owned media outlet RT also twisted the facts surrounding Russia\u2019s energy supply pressure, which Polygraph.info fact-checked in March.\n\nEach of these gas cuts interrupted the market, leaving several European countries without natural gas supplies during the winter. On the heels of skyrocketing oil prices - gas prices follow oil prices with a delay of several months - Russia found a new tool to influence the domestic policies of the affected countries. Playing geopolitics with energy followed Vladimir Putin\u2019s infamous anti-Western speech in Munich in 2007.\n\nFast-forwarding to the present day, Europeans are still depend on cheap Russian gas. The Russian media and government continue to portray Washington as the aggressor, spinning the recent visit of Jean-Claude Junker, the president of the European Commission, as a way for U.S. President Donald Trump to persuade Europe to build more terminals for American LNG.\n\nRussia has dominated the European energy market for decades and even RIA Novosti has said Russia\u2019s gas cannot be simply replaced by American LNG, which is a small supply compared to the continent\u2019s overall gas consumption. Polygraph.info\u2019s January fact check detailed the fact that the U.S. LNG supplies do not \u201creduce the energy security in Europe\u201d as RT claimed, but actually contribute to energy stability in Europe.", "lang": "en"}
