The archived versions of the posts can be accessed here and here , and the Facebook post can be viewed here.\n\nThe variety of apple was developed by researchers at the Consorzio Italiano Vivaisti (CIV) in 2007 by crossing the Liberty and Gala varieties of apples.\n\nThe 'Filipo' in the fake post could be a reference to Pier Filippo Tagliani, chairman of CIV.\n\nBOOM also checked the official page of Modi Apple Australia. It turns out that the 'Modi' in question here is renowned painter and sculptor Amedeo Modigliani and not India's prime minister.\n\nThe About section of the page traces the 'apple' story in detail.\n\n\"The unusual name comes from the world of art, more exactly from Amedeo Modigliani, an artist born in Livorno and affectionately known as Mod\u00ec to his friends; he was famous for his portraits of women painted using intense red earth colours, just like those of the Mod\u00ec Apple.\"\n\nAmedeo Modigliani was an Italian Jewish painter and sculptor. He found great popularity after his death in 1920. His notable works include the Redheaded Girl in Evening Dress, Jeanne H\u00e9buterne in Red Shawl, and Madame Pompadour.\n\nBOOM also reached out to the Modi Apple, Australia for a comment. In their response, they reiterated the statement on their website i.e. 'It is inspired by the Italian Painter - Amedeo Modigliani (sic.)'.\n\nA number of images were shared with the viral post that claimed the name Mod\u00ec Apples was inspired by Narendra Modi.\n\nWe ran a reverse image search on the images and found that most of them were lifted from the company's Facebook page or Twitter handle.", "lang": "en"}
