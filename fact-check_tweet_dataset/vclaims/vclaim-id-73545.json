The uptick in their popularity appears to have coincided with an increase in misinformation about the devices.\n\nThis particular Instagram post claims non-contact infrared thermometers deliver a harmful \u201cshot of radiation\u201d to the pineal gland, a small endocrine organ in the brain that produces melatonin and other hormones. Accompanying the claim are two juxtaposed images: an illustration of brain structures and a photo of someone having their temperature taken.\n\nBut, according to medical experts and a temperature instrument retailer, the post\u2019s claim is inaccurate.

It\u2019s catching light waves.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
