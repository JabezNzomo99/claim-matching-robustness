Lewis once said, \u201cYou can\u2019t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Lewis wrote this expression, which may only date back to the 1980s.\n\nIn 1982, author James Sherman published a book on how to overcome rejection. \u201cAll of us have been rejected more than once. We\u2019ve been turned down for jobs, had applications refused, and lost out in romance,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSherman advised readers not to fixate on the past, making this observation: \u201cYou can\u2019t go back and make a new start, but you can start right now and make a brand new ending.\u201d\n\nThe excerpt, found by the website Quote Investigator, tracks closely with the quote shared on Facebook. It also happens to be the first known instance of the saying.\n\nThough the Facebook post attributes the quote to Lewis, who died in 1963, there is no record of him saying it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fairly sure that that was not written by Lewis, as it doesn\u2019t quite sound like him, nor have I ever encountered it,\u201d Steve Elmore, vice president of events and communications for the C.S. Lewis Foundation, told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\nThe statement appears nowhere in Lewis\u2019 writings, and the attribution has been previously debunked by William O\u2019Flaherty, author of \u201cThe Misquotable C.S. Lewis.\u201d\n\nThe quote reminded Elmore of a section in the book \u201cMere Christianity\u201d in which Lewis talks about progress: \u201cIf you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case, the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
