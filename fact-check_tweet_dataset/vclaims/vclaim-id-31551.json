Amy Klobuchar on her record as a county prosecutor, asking why minority voters should forgive her for her office\u2019s role in the controversial conviction of a black teenager.\n\n\"You did prosecute a black teenager who was sentenced to life in prison, despite what are now serious doubts about the evidence,\" Todd said.\n\nThe case involving then-teenager Myon Burrell has faced heightened scrutiny following a year-long Associated Press investigation that raised questions about Burrell\u2019s conviction.\n\nThe investigation concluded that Burrell\u2019s investigators relied on flawed evidence and failed to chase down leads that could have exonerated Burrell of charges that he fired the stray bullet that killed an 11-year-old girl, Tyesha Edwards, at her dining room table in 2002.\n\nIn response to Todd\u2019s question, Klobuchar defended her career as the Hennepin County attorney and called for a review of the case based on the AP\u2019s findings.\n\n\"I think it's very important that that evidence come forward,\" she said.\n\nThe answer marked a shift in tone for the Minnesota senator, who previously heralded the case as proof of her commitment to justice for African Americans devastated by gun violence.\n\nKlobuchar highlighted the victim\u2019s story in TV ads aired during her Senate campaigns, and she\u2019s also cited it in interviews and speeches during her ongoing bid for the presidency.\n\nOn stage in September for the Democratic debate in Houston, she said she was \"proud\" of her record seeking justice for African Americans, including the \"little girl named Tyesha Edwards, who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window.\"\n\nAlthough Burrell, now 33, was convicted twice, he has maintained his innocence, filed several appeals and rejected all plea deals, arguing that he wasn\u2019t even at the scene of the shooting.\n\nMore than 17 years later, the AP\u2019s investigation revealed that the case against him may have been flawed, and the Hennepin County attorney\u2019s office is standing by its conviction.\n\nHere, without weighing in on which side is right, we provide the facts.\n\nKlobuchar served as Hennepin County\u2019s attorney from 1999 through 2006, meaning she supervised Burrell\u2019s original jury trial, conviction and sentencing in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed Burrell\u2019s conviction over a Miranda-rights violation and other errors. By the time Burrell\u2019s case was revisited in the form of a bench trial, Klobuchar had moved to the Senate, leaving the retrial to her successor, Michael Freeman.\n\nIn both trials, Burrell was convicted along with co-defendants Hans Williams and Ike Tyson of murdering Edwards while shooting at Timothy Oliver, a rival gang member.\n\nTyson now insists that he pulled the trigger, shooting from behind a 5-foot wall roughly 120 feet away with the intention of scaring Oliver, according to the AP\u2019s report.\n\nBut other evidence led prosecutors to Burrell. At one point, Oliver said Burrell was the shooter. (Read the findings of fact in Burrell\u2019s second trial in the spring of 2008.)\n\nThe AP reviewed more than a thousand pages of court documents, police records and interrogation videos. Its reporters interviewed dozens of witnesses, inmates, family members, ex-gang members, attorneys and criminal justice experts.\n\nTheir report said that Oliver, who died shortly before Burrell\u2019s second trial, had contradicted himself when describing what he saw during the night in question.\n\nThe report also pinpointed potentially exonerating evidence that it said investigators did not fully pursue, including surveillance video footage from the convenience store Burrell claimed he was in at the time of the shooting, as well testimony from the people Burrell claimed he was with.\n\nProsecutors did not recover the gun or gather fingerprint or DNA evidence, the report said.\n\nFinally, the report accused Burrell\u2019s prosecutors of building a case in the second trial that was overly dependent on jailhouse informants, some of whom have recanted, who were shown on tape being offered cash and sentence reductions in exchange for hearsay information.\n\nOne informant, Terry Arrington, told the AP that \"everybody told a lie to get time cut.\"\n\nWhat Klobuchar, the Hennepin County attorney\u2019s office said\n\nWe asked Klobuchar\u2019s campaign if she believes the case was correctly prosecuted and if she disputes any details of the AP\u2019s report. The campaign did not directly answer those questions.\n\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, Klobuchar said the case should be reviewed \"immediately.\"\n\n\"If any evidence was not put forward or was not appropriately investigated, or if new evidence has emerged that should have been discovered at the time, it must be reviewed,\" she said.\n\nFreeman, the current Hennepin County attorney, said in a statement that his office has been cooperating with Burrell\u2019s lawyers and remains open to reviewing new evidence. But he also said the bulk of the evidence identified in the AP\u2019s report was not new.\n\n\"We pretty much dispute everything in the AP story,\" office spokesman Chuck Laszewski said.\n\nFreeman\u2019s statement addressed several of the AP investigation\u2019s findings, including the idea that Burrell could have been cleared by surveillance footage from the convenience store.\n\nFreeman said Burrell offered conflicting stories about where he was at the time of the shooting and that the people who claim to have been with him at the store \"never came forward.\"\n\nHe said Burrell\u2019s conviction hinged on Oliver\u2019s testimony, earlier testimony from Williams and Tyson, and testimony from two people who said Burrell confessed to them privately.\n\nFreeman also said it\u2019s common for investigators to offer cash rewards and for prosecutors to secure convictions without fingerprint or DNA evidence.\n\nDaniel Guerrero, an attorney for Burrell since 2017, said Burrell\u2019s legal team is moving forward in their attempts to free him.\n\n\"There is really nothing definitive I have reviewed in either the investigation or prosecution of this case that leads me to believe Myon is guilty,\" Guerrero said.\n\nIn an interview with \"Fox News Sunday\" after the AP investigation published, Klobuchar told host Chris Wallace that she \"didn\u2019t know about this new evidence until I saw the report.\"\n\nBut the AP reported that Klobuchar\u2019s office would have been aware of a number of the problems with Burrell\u2019s prosecution, including:\n\u2022 That Oliver gave conflicting accounts of what he saw.\n\u2022 That investigators did not get testimony from the people Burrell said he was with.\n\u2022 That investigators did not seek the surveillance tape from the convenience store.\n\u2022 That no gun, fingerprint or DNA evidence incriminated Burrell.\n\u2022 That video shows an investigator offering cash for hearsay information.\n\u2022 That Williams and Tyson have said Burrell was not with them during the shooting.\n\u2022 That investigators did not follow up after Williams identified a different man, Tyree Jackson, by name and in a photo lineup as the third person involved in the shooting.\n\nThe Hennepin County attorney\u2019s office noted that Klobuchar was \"not the trial attorney\" during the first trial and said the conviction at the second trial was obtained \"with no input from her.\"\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily clear her from responsibility, Guerrero said.\n\n\"There were two lead attorneys who prosecuted the case, but obviously as their boss, she ultimately bears responsibility for the actions of her line prosecutors,\" Guerrero said.\n\nIn the weeks since the AP\u2019s investigation came out, Klobuchar has faced calls to suspend her presidential campaign from civil rights activists and community leaders in Minneapolis.\n\nThe president of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP said Klobuchar has \"questions that need to be answered,\" while the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota called Burrell\u2019s conviction \"a gross miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nMedia figures have also pressed Klobuchar on the issue. Before Todd prodded her in Las Vegas, former federal prosecutor Sunny Hostin, a co-host of ABC\u2019s \"The View,\" blasted her office\u2019s prosecution of Burrell.\n\n\"I\u2019ve reviewed the facts of that case, and it is one of the most flawed investigations and prosecutions that I think I have ever seen,\" Hostin said.\n\nBurrell\u2019s trial jury has spoken out, too. Joe McLean, the jury foreman for Burrell\u2019s first trial, told the AP he regrets voting to convict and feels \"that we were misled.\"\n\nPaul Fedor, the last juror to decide on a guilty verdict, told the AP that he was bothered during the trial by the notion that Burrell, at 5\u20193\" tall, could have visibly fired a gun over a 5-foot wall.", "lang": "en"}
