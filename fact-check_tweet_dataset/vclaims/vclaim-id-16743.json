He said in an interview with the Kremlin-funded multi-language website NewsFront, which promotes pro-Russian ideas in European countries, that Montenegro sought approval from the U.S. for the legislation.\n\nIn response to a query by Voice of America, a senior U.S. State Department official, speaking on background, said Bozovic\u2019s claims have no merit.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not have a role in the legislative process in Montenegro,\u201d the official said. \u201cBroadly speaking, the United States has always been supportive of reforms that are needed to help any country to develop inclusive, transparent, and democratic institutions. But these decisions are for the respective governments and their people to decide.\u201d\n\nContacted by Polygraph.info, Dubravka Lalovic, the Deputy Chief of Mission in Montenegro\u2019s Washington embassy, backed the U.S. stance.\n\n\u201cThe statement is false,\u201d she said. \u201cMontenegro is a sovereign state and no other country has a part in decision making regarding the legislative process. Any support by our partners of the reforms we are implementing is always welcome, but all the decisions are made by the Parliament.\u201d\n\nMargarita Assenova, a Balkans expert at The Jamestown Foundation told Polygraph.info that the U.S. can only act in an advisory role.\n\n\u201cAlthough anti-corruption is among U.S. priorities in the region, the U.S. embassies can only help in providing technical expertise and advice, but not directly intervene in the law-making process,\u201d Assenova said.", "lang": "en"}
