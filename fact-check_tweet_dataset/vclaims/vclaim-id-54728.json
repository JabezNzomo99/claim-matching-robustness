This is false; the fabricated tweet has more characters than was allowed in 2009 and it does not appear in Twitter archives.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s handling of this whole pandemic has been terrible! As President, ALL responsibility becomes yours during a crisis like this, whether or not you\u2019re entirely to blame. John McCain, and myself for that matter myself, would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office,\u201d reads the fake tweet, which has been circulating since at least April 16, 2020.\n\nA screenshot of the message appears on Facebook here and here, on Instagram here and on Twitter here. Some versions of the manufactured tweet show the date it was allegedly posted -- November 23, 2009 -- and a supposed \u201c1.1K Retweets\u201d and \u201c6.2K Likes.\u201d Some also include the caption \u201cWell this didn\u2019t age well.\u201d\n\nAt 297 characters, the content could not have been posted in 2009, when the Twitter limit was 140 characters, or even after 2017, when it was doubled to 280 characters.\n\nSearching the text on Factbase, a website with the goal \u201cto make available, unedited, the entire corpus of an individual's public statements and recordings,\u201d returns no results. Neither does the content appear on Trump Twitter Archive, a searchable database of Trump\u2019s tweets created by coder Brendan Brown.\n\nThe H1N1 virus (swine flu) emerged in the spring of 2009 -- shortly after which the tweet was purportedly posted. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that there were more than 60 million cases and nearly 12,500 deaths from the disease in the US between April 2009 and April 2010.\n\nThe novel coronavirus has spread from China around the world, killing more than 45,000 people in the US and infecting more than 830,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 350 examples of false and misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
