Ferguson also pointed to contributions from Trump to Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\n\nTrump\u2019s loyalties have not been exclusive to Republicans, Ferguson noted. In 2000, he launched a short-lived bid for the Reform Party\u2019s presidential nomination, receiving more than 15,000 votes in the party\u2019s California primary -- a tally that would have won him the state had he not already withdrawn from the race. Ferguson also directed us to his complicated history with party registration.\n\nWe went to two authoritative databases of campaign finance data to examine Ferguson\u2019s numbers: OpenSecrets.org, to find federal donations, and FollowtheMoney.org, for state-level donations.\n\nTrump has actually been relatively evenhanded in doling out cash to the two parties, but since 1989, he\u2019s contributed over $350,000 more to Republicans running for federal and state offices, campaign finance records show.\n\nData from the Federal Election Commission and state elections offices provided by the two websites show that Trump has given $584,850 to Democrats and $961,140 to the GOP over the last 26 years.\n\nThe difference in donations is almost entirely captured in Trump\u2019s recent giving. Since 2012, Trump has donated $463,450 to Republicans and just $3,500 to Democrats (California Attorney General Kamala Harris and New York Assemblyman Michael Benedetto).\n\nWe\u2019ve included those numbers below, with links to records of the individual contributions.\n\nIn short, Ferguson\u2019s claim might have been true had he uttered it just a few years ago. In 2011, a Washington Post analysis of Trump\u2019s donations found the majority of them going to Democrats. But the flow of cash from Trump to Democrats has fallen off; the last time he gave to a Democrat running for federal office was in 2010.\n\nWe can\u2019t drill down into local and city politics because there is no single campaign finance database. But we should note that Trump donated $50,000 to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel in 2010, as well as over $25,000 more to other Cook County Democrats, among other donations that he\u2019s made on the local level. (Trump has made his presence known in the Windy City.)\n\nAt the same time, however, the real estate mogul\u2019s gifts to Republican candidates and organizations increased dramatically. Since 2010, Trump has donated $124,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and given another $50,000 to American Crossroads, a conservative super PAC.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that just as Trump\u2019s political ambitions and private business interests often seem to overlap, it\u2019s sometimes difficult to parse out the exact motivations behind many of his political contributions over the years.\n\nAs an influential real estate developer in the Northeast and in cities around the world, Trump\u2019s contributions may have not have much to do with one\u2019s political party.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2007, for instance, Trump made 12 separate donations to New Jersey Rep. Frank LoBiondo, a Republican who represents the Garden State\u2019s Second Congressional District. The district includes Atlantic City, where the Trump Organization used to have significant holdings.\n\nWhile conservatives like Ferguson have criticized Trump for his donations to Democrats, Trump defended himself as having no viable Republican options in overwhelmingly blue states like New York. \"Everyone\u2019s Democratic,\" he told Sean Hannity in 2011. \"So what am I going to do \u2014 contribute to Republicans? One thing: I\u2019m not stupid. Am I going to contribute to Republicans for my whole life when they get heat when they run against some Democrat and the most they can get is 1 percent of the vote?\"\n\nFerguson said that Trump has \"given more money to Democratic candidates than Republican candidates.\"\n\nWe can\u2019t say definitively that his claim is wrong at all levels of government, since we don\u2019t have the local data. But public records show that the real estate tycoon has actually contributed around $350,000 more to Republicans at the state and federal level than Democrats. That, however, is a recent development.\n\nFerguson\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
