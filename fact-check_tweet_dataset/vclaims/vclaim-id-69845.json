Holding\u2019s ad tells the story of Udiel Aguilar-Castellanos, though it does not mention his name.\n\nThe video ad says \"an illegal immigrant sexually assaulted a child in Carrboro. ICE wanted to deport him, but Orange County released him \u2014 like a sanctuary city. Linda Coleman supports sanctuary cities. George Holding opposes sanctuary cities that protect criminals.\"\n\nThe radio ad goes into a little more detail:\n\n\"An illegal immigrant was arrested for a DUI in Durham. However, he was released instead of being deported. Then, he committed a second crime. He sexually assaulted an 11-year-old child in Carrboro. This time, ICE immediately asked local police to detain him, so he could be deported after his trial. But Orange County doesn\u2019t honor ICE requests to detain illegal immigrants. They released him, the same way sanctuary cities do.\"\n\nPolitiFact asked the Holding campaign to explain its claims about how the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department handled the Aguilar-Castellanos case.\n\nCharles Hellwig, chairman of the Wake County GOP, responded on Holding\u2019s behalf with several news stories about the case. He also provided a video of Coleman saying she supports sanctuary cities. The video, in which Coleman does indeed express support for sanctuary cities, was recorded during an April 23 candidate forum in Raleigh by the LGBTQ Democrats of Wake County, Hellwig said.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at what happened to Aguilar-Castellanos. Holding\u2019s ad says he was released. But it doesn\u2019t mention anything about whether he was charged or convicted.\n\nOn June 27, Aguilar-Castellanos pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual battery involving an 11-year-old child and was required to register as a sex offender, The Herald-Sun reported. He was initially charged with felony indecent liberties with a child and felony second-degree kidnapping.\n\nHowever, The Herald-Sun reported, an agreement with prosecutors allowed Aguilar-Castellanos to plead guilty to the lesser charge and to be released immediately because he had served 293 days in jail awaiting trial. The maximum sentence he could have received for the sexual battery charges was 150 days, the paper reported.\n\nThe time served by Aguilar-Castellanos isn\u2019t mentioned in the Holding ad. That omission could leave some believing that he was never punished for his crime.\n\nSo what did the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department do that was \"like a sanctuary city?\"\n\nWhile there\u2019s no formal definition of a sanctuary city, the term often refers to towns or cities that offer some protections to immigrants who are in the country without legal permission. In criminal cases, the local officials often refuse to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Policies and procedures vary by city and state.\n\nIn NC, the law signed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in 2015 makes it illegal for cities or towns to block their police or sheriff\u2019s departments from collaborating with ICE or other federal agencies. The law also forbids local governments from accepting consulate or embassy documents as a form of identification, WUNC reported.\n\nState designations aside, no NC town is considered a sanctuary city by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring low levels of immigration. And no NC town was targeted by the U.S. Justice Department last year when it sent letters to 29 jurisdictions, questioning the legality of their policies for dealing with immigration authorities.\n\nHowever, according to The Herald-Sun and the Associated Press, Orange County Sheriff Charles Blackwood has said his office does not honor immigration detainers from ICE because it has concerns about potential civil rights lawsuits. That means it doesn\u2019t hold immigrants in custody if there\u2019s no warrant, or if they\u2019re not serving a sentence.\n\nSo the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s department released Aguilar-Castellanos when he had completed his sentence on June 27, the same day he pleaded guilty. (Remember: He was sentenced to time-served.)\n\nICE agents later arrested him in Georgia \u2014 and publicly complained about having to track him down.\n\nICE said in a news release that Aguilar-Castellanos had been under a federal immigration judge\u2019s removal order since January 2015. An immigration detainer also was issued to the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office in September 2017 after his initial arrest, they said.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said it attempted to contact ICE by phone, but that the effort was unsuccessful. In response to ICE\u2019s public complaints, the Orange County Sheriff said that ICE could\u2019ve assumed custody of Aguilar-Castellanos \"at any point\" during his nearly 300 days in custody.\n\nHolding released a pair of campaign ads that say an illegal immigrant assaulted a child in Carrboro and that the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office released him \"like a sanctuary city.\" The ad doesn\u2019t mention that the immigrant was convicted and completed his sentence. The Orange County jail did release the man. But the ad doesn\u2019t mention that ICE had nearly 300 days to assume custody prior to his release. We rate this claim Half True.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
