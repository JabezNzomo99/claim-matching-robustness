But several experts told FactCheck.org and CNN that they never heard of such a 30-day timeline.\n\nIn fact, when the Obama White House first announced the deployment of special operations troops in October 2015, then-Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t have a specific date to give you when they will come out.\u201d\n\nEarnest said that \u201cwe\u2019ve been quite candid about the fact that this is not a short-term proposition in terms of our counter-ISIL strategy,\u201d referring to the terrorist organization known as the Islamic State.\n\nTrump also wrongly claimed that thousands of captured Islamic State fighters in Syria were \u201cmostly from Europe,\u201d when in fact they are overwhelmingly from Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe most recent report from the inspectors general of the Department of Defense, the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development says that of the 10,000 Islamic State fighters being detained by the Syrian Democratic Forces across northeastern Syria, 8,000 were nationals of Iraq and Syria. The rest were \u201cforeign fighters\u201d from other countries, including \u201cabout 800 \u2026 believed to be from European nations.\u201d\n\nFor more on these claims, see our story \u201cTrump\u2019s False Tweets on Syria.\u201d Our previous fact-checking video collaborations with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d are posted on our website.", "lang": "en"}
