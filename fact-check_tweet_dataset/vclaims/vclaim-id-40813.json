In receipts issued for donations made to political parties, the PAN number of the receiver and not the donor is listed.\n\nThe PAN number AAABB0157F, cannot belong to Narendra Modi as per the format followed by India\u2019s Income Tax Department.\n\nThe fourth character of a PAN number helps to identify if it belongs to an individual or entity.\n\nIn the fourth character, 'B' stands for Body of Individuals (BOI) whereas 'P' stands for an individual.\n\nThe PAN number AAABB0157F has 'B' as its fourth character, indicating that it belongs to a body of individuals, in this case the BJP.\n\nFurthermore, the fifth character of the PAN number is first letter of the card holder\u2019s last name. If the PAN number belonged to Modi, the fifth character in 'AAABB0157F' should have been 'M' and not 'B'.\n\nNarendra Modi\u2019s original PAN details are in the public domain, as a candidate contesting elections must reveal it as part of an affidavit submitted to the Election Commission of India.\n\nModi\u2019s PAN number 'AHHPM8993N' can be found here in an affidavit he filed before the 2014 general elections. Modi's PAN number AHHPM8993N meets the criteria of the fourth character (P) belonging to an individual and fifth character (M), first alphabet of the PAN holder's last name (Modi).", "lang": "en"}
