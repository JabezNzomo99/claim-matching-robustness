How \u2018Chinese\u2019 Social Media Warriors Are Waging a War Against India After the violent stand-off between Indian and the Chinese Troops in the Galwan Valley along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Twitter has emerged as a battlefront with multiple handles impersonating Chinese nationals being used to spread misinformation against India. The Quint debunked one such profile (@CNPakww) which goes by the username - \u7f8e\u9e97\u7684\u7537 \u4f55\u91d1\u6fe4 (Mandarin). We observed several red flags and during the course of our analysis identified multiple instances where the handle in question deliberately peddled misinformation on issues ranging from situation along the India-China border, India\u2019s relations with other South Asian countries and even on internal security-related matters. An archived version of the profile can be accessed here. Edited Video Used to Claim Three-Eyed Baby Born in Germany\n\nThe amount of fake news being generated from just this one Twitter handle presented a pertinent question on the scale of misinformation being propagated on social media on not just the situation along the India-China border but also on India\u2019s internal security-related issues. To understand this, we reached out to Nandakishore Harikumar, the founder of Technisanct \u2013 a cybersecurity firm based out of Kochi. He told us that his firm has been monitoring such activities for quite some time and using tools like Trendsmap, Twint and Social Bearing, they\u2019ve found that most of these fake profiles get huge traction from Pakistan. We also reached out to Twitter to understand how effective have Twitter\u2019s policies been in identifying and countering State-sponsored misinformation. A spokesperson from the company told us that it is Twitter\u2019s top priority to keep people safe from any kind of \u201ccoordinated activity\u201d on the platform. You can read the story here. 2. Viral Video of Amitabh Bachchan Thanking Nanavati Medics is Old A video of actor Amitabh Bachchan thanking the doctors, nurses and staff members of Nanavati Hospital is being widely shared on social media and by several news organisations with a claim that it is from his recent visit to the hospital after he tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday, 11 July. In the video, Bachchan can be seen thanking the medics for their relentless battle against the virus. He says, \u201cI thank the doctors, nurses and staff of Nanavati Hospital for the tremendous work that they are doing in these trying times.\u201d However, we found that the claim is false and the video is from April and was recorded by the actor during the lockdown to thank the medical fraternity for braving the virus and helping people. Fact-Check: That Photo of Sambit Patra With Vikas Dubey is Morphed\n\nA tweet from a fake Twitter account of Sara Pilot, wife of Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, is going viral on social media. The tweet seems to attack Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, amid the ongoing political turmoil in the state. News organisation IANS fell for the tweet and published a news report, leading the tweet to be amplified, but in reality, Sara has not tweeted any such thing. An archived version of this tweet can be seen here. In the tweet, Sara appears to be attacking Gehlot without taking his name, saying that even \u201cbig magicians\u201d will start sweating when they (referring to Sachin) turn to Delhi. In reality, Sara Pilot is not on Twitter and a fake account in her name has gone viral with a tweet about the current political scenario in Rajasthan. You can read the story here. 4.

Not Really!\n\nA viral message falsely claiming that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has approved a mixture of black pepper powder, honey and ginger juice as a cure for the novel coronavirus is doing the rounds on social media. But there is no truth to this message and while honey and ginger may have soothing effects, there is no evidence that they can cure COVID-19. Many such messages with claims about natural home remedies having the ability to cure COVID-19 have been doing the rounds since the pandemic broke. However, as before, none of these have been proved to be effective in curing COVID-19. Further, there is still no approved cure for the novel coronavirus and the world is still waiting for vaccines to be developed and approved. You can read the story here.
