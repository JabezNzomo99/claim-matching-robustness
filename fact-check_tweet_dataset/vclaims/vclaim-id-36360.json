This is false; both the agency and the retailer denied it, and there was no recall for beef products in Canada that month.\n\n\u201cBeef products sold at Walmart recalled due to E. coli,\u201d reads the headline of the article published on February 5, 2020.\n\nIt claims that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) issued a recall on all beef products sold at Walmart stores in the country on February 3. The recall was allegedly expanded to include products sold at \u201cPusateri\u2019s Fine Foods, and others in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and New Brunswick.\u201d\n\nBut the CFIA\u2019s website, which lists all active food recalls in the country, shows that there has not been a recent recall for beef products of any kind, nor were there any recalls issued on February 3.\n\nMarsha Johnston, the agency\u2019s spokeswoman, confirmed that \u201cthe CFIA did not issue a recall.\u201d\n\n\u201cWalmart Canada does sell beef products and there are no recalls on any of these,\u201d Felicia Fefer, a Walmart representative, told AFP by email.\n\nThe last CFIA warning for any beef product was published on January 17 and was about a type of beef sausages made by VG Meats and sold in Ontario.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that a recall for beef products was issued on February 3 and subsequently deleted, because recalls usually remain on CFIA\u2019s website \u201cfor a few years in case someone still has some of the product in their freezer,\u201d Christine Carnaffan, another CFIA spokesperson, told AFP.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked false content from the source of this incorrect warning, toronto-ontario.news, in the past. In July 2019, the website warned of an E. coli outbreak affecting lettuce sold in the central Canadian province of Ontario.\n\nAFP also debunked false reports of a recall of 400 million eggs in Canada in June 2019 due to a salmonella outbreak.\n\nConsumers who want more information about product recalls in Canada can learn about the food safety investigation process on this webpage.", "lang": "en"}
