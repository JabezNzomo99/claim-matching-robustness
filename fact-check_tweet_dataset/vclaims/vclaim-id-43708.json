The \u201clittle green men\u201d bloodless invasion resulted in unmarked Russian soldiers taking control of the Republic.\n\nOn March 16, the new Russia-installed government staged a referendum, which completed the annexation of the peninsula by Russia.\n\nOn March 27, the United Nation General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262, stating that the referendum, \u201chaving no validity, cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol.\u201d The resolution urged all countries \u201cnot to recognize any alteration of the status\u201d of Crimea.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s annexation of Crimea violated post-Soviet agreements Russia signed establishing the sovereignty and borders of Ukraine.\n\nIn December 1991, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and the Belorussian Supreme Soviet President Alexander Lukashenko signed the Belavezha Accord, which all three countries ratified that month, formally ending the Soviet Union and agreeing to existing borders.\n\nIn 1994, the U.S, Russia and Britain as nuclear powers, committed to respect the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine, under condition that Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons deployed on its territory \u2013 the Budapest Memorandum.\n\nThe international community\u2019s answer to Russia\u2019s violation of this important treaty was swift \u2013 it imposed a number of sanctions against many Russian companies, banks and individuals. Russia was kicked out of the Group of Eight (G8) of most industrialized nations \u2013 all considered advanced democracies.\n\nVatsev\u2019s comments quoted by RIA Novosti came as he visited Simferopol, Crimea\u2019s capital city and asserted that Crimea, as RIA put it, \u201c\u2026has long been Russian territory\u2026\u201d Let\u2019s dig into that history:\n\nCrimea was considered as one of the jewels in the Russian Tsarist crown, with Yalta as a top summer retreat of Romanov tsars and Odessa as an important cultural center where many Russian writers and poets were born or resided. The peninsula was part of Tsarist Russia from 1783, when Russia annexed it from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1991 Russia and Ukraine were part of one country, the former Soviet Union, the enter of communist ideology, a nuclear power seen as locked in a bi-polar rivalry with the U.S. and much of Europe.\n\nIn 1954, the Soviet government under Nikita Khrushchev, secretary of the Communist Party, transferred Crimea from the Russian Soviet Federation of Socialist Republics to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Many historians regard the transfer as \u201cadministrative\u201d and \u201ca gesture of goodwill,\u201d a propaganda move to consolidate Khrushchev\u2019s power after Stalin\u2019s death in 1953.\n\nDuring Soviet times, nearly 200,000 Crimean Tartars were deported from their original homeland. While many have since returned, the UN considers the Tartars \u201ca vulnerable minority\u201d in the largely Russian-speaking province \u2013 now under Russian rule or \u201coccupation\u201d as some call it.\n\nIn 2014, National Geographic Magazine described Crimea as \u201cphysically, politically\u2026Ukraine,\u201d but \u201cmentally and emotionally\u201d identifying with Russia, with memories of the peninsula as a Soviet-era holiday playground.\n\nYet, Russia defied the agreements it had negotiated and adopted when Vladimir Putin\u2019s government staged its bloodless invasion. And with the 2014 UN resolution in force, most nations regard Crimea as Ukrainian, under international law.", "lang": "en"}
