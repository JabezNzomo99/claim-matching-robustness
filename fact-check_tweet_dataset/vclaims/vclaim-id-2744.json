Mikhalych - Russian Patriot Executed by Ukrainian Nazi", "subtitle": "Despite the satirical nature of the tweet passing off a photo of the notorious American criminal as a Russian militiaman in Ukraine, the post was retweeted by top Russian politician and even made headlines in the Russian press.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "November 24, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-2744", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/charles-manson-russia-ukraine/28875532.html", "vclaim": "The day the news broke in the U.S. that Charles Manson, the notorious mass killer and cult leader who preached race war, had died, a Russian satirical Twitter account, @cinicarea, posted a photograph of Manson with the caption:\n\n\u201cThis brave old man was a messenger in a unit of fighters for the freedom of Novorossiya. Neighbors and friends in Luhansk knew him as Mikhalych, his fellow militiamen knew him by his nom de guerre Charlie. Today he fell into the clutches of the Banderovtsy. Before the execution these filthy men draw a swastika on his forehead. We will not forget, we will not forgive!\u201d\n\nIn Russia it is considered patriotic to call the parts of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russia-backed separatists \u201cNovorossiya,\u201d including the separatists\u2019 self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk \u201cpeople\u2019s republics.\u201d Kyiv accuses Moscow of having invaded these parts of Ukraine militarily, and the international community has also accused Russia of attempting to destabilize eastern Ukraine and promoting its secession.\n\nThe term \u201cBanderovtsy\u201d used in the tweet refers to Stepan Bandera, a World War II-era activist of Ukrainian of Polish origin who led a nationalist movement for Ukraine\u2019s independence from the Soviet Union. Bandera cooperated with Nazi Germany at the beginning of the war but was later arrested by the Gestapo and sent to a Nazi concentration camp. The term \u201cBanderovtsy\u201d is a favorite of Russian media and politicians, who used it to label those Ukrainians who opposed their country\u2019s Kremlin-backed president, Viktor Yanukovych, and later on also applied it to Ukrainian servicemen fighting the Moscow-backed separatists.\n\nDespite the obvious satirical nature of the Charles Manson-a.k.a.-Mikhalych tweet, many in Russia believed it was true, possibly including Igor Morozov, a Russian Senator representing Ryazan Oblast in the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament. The @cinicarea tweet was shared and liked nearly 700 times, and received about 80 responses.\n\nMorozov later deleted his retweet, but only after he was ridiculed in Russia\u2019s mainstream Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper.\n\nRussian government-backed media and even government institutions have regularly presented doctored photos and videos as \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d of the crimes committed by those Russia considers her adversaries.", "lang": "en"}
