Delhi's Jamia Milia Islamia University and Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have been at the forefront of the student agitation.\n\nSeveral posts on Facebook and Twitter have claimed that the man in the photograph is Bharat Sharma, a law student at Delhi University and a member of the ABVP, student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nClick here to view an archived version of the post.\n\nThe same misleading claim has been reiterated on Twitter.\n\nClick here to view the tweet.\n\nAnother video of a man wearing a red shirt lathicharging female protesters is also viral with claims that the man is Sharma, an ABVP member. The video is being shared with a screenshot of Sharma's now deleted Facebook profile.\n\nA shocking video of a man kicking a protestor has gone viral with several saying that he is Bharat Sharma. This video is being linked with the image of a plainclothes man posing with a lathi in full riot gear and the video showing a man in a red shirt hitting female protestors.\n\nBOOM contacted Delhi police who confirmed that the man striking a pose in full riot gear is a constable with the Delhi polices Anti Auto Theft Squad. MS Randhawa, DCP (Central), while speaking to BOOM said, \"This image is of a constable with the Anti Auto Theft Squad of Delhi Police who was posted as security for the protests.\"\n\nRandhawa told India Today that the Delhi police enquired about the man seen in the above photo and found that he is constable Arvind who was \"deployed near New Friends Colony on Sunday to control Jamia protestors\". He added that members of specialised units like the AATS \"mostly operate in plainclothes while controlling the unruly mob\"\n\n\n\nVIDEO OF A MAN KICKING A PROTESTOR IS OF BHARAT SHARMA\n\nBOOM also found a tweet by Sharma himself, confirming that he is the one seen in the video kicking a protestor at the Delhi University campus.\n\nHe also took to Twitter to clarify that he was not the person seen in the full riot gear posing with other Delhi policemen or the man seen lathicharging female protestors. While Sharma did not respond to calls, reports suggest that Sharma is a law student at the Delhi University and \"an active member of the ABVP\"", "lang": "en"}
