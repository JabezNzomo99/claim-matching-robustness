And what is surprising is that her daughter Mona is also a student of JNU now.\u201d\n\nThe posts have been shared more than 3500 times at the time of writing this article.\n\nThe screen grab is viral on multiple Facebook pages.\n\nThe post is viral in the wake of the protests against hostel fee hike at the university. In a latest development, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) announced in a notice that it has set up a high-level committee to hold discussions with students of JNU and resolve all issues peacefully.\n\nStudents continued to protest on Monday over the hike in hostel fees on the campus. The University had initially scaled down the hike in hostel charges. However, the students have demanded a complete rollback with regard to the hostel charges and other measures proposed.\n\nBOOM found the video of the viral screen grab, which is part of Zee News show DNA Analysis. The show, aired on November 15, revolves around the 'misbehaviour of JNU students against the Zee News reporters who were present on field, reporting about the protests.\" The same woman from the screen grab can be seen at 2.57 mark of the protests.\n\nBOOM reached out to Shambhavi Siddhi, a Master's student of the French department, identified as the woman in the viral screen grab. Siddhi confirmed that it is her and said, \"Yes, it is me in the photograph. I was shouting slogans against the propaganda media channels.\"\n\nSiddhi further added that she is 23 years old and not 43 as stated in the viral posts.\n\nMultiple past and present students have been subject of misinformation in the wake of the protests.", "lang": "en"}
