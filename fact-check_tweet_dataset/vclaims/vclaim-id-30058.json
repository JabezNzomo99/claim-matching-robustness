The video has a speech of Rahul Gandhi playing out in the background.\n\nSeveral people on Facebook and Twitter shared the video with an identical claim.\n\nWith a keyword search on Google, Alt News found that the same video was uploaded by YouTube channel \u2018Indian Weapons\u2019 on March 2, 2017.\n\n\u201cCongress Bribing Voters In Imphal, Manipur? VIDEO GOES VIRAL !\u201d, reads the title of the video. The above video uploaded in March 2017 doesn\u2019t have the background voice of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi but people\u2019s chatter.\n\nA closer look at the video reveals that a woman is holding a placard which reads, \u201cWard 5 KMC\u201d. With a Google search, we found that KMC stands for \u201cKakching Municipal Council\u201d. According to a report by The Wire, Manipur\u2019s Kakching was sliced out of Thoubal and made into a new district. It is worthwhile to note that the assembly election in Manipur was held between March 4 and March 8, 2017.\n\nThe audio of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s speech, superimposed over the video, is from an election rally at Gandhinagar during the Gujarat assembly elections in 2017. At 2:28 mins from the video, you can hear the relevant speech. This video was earlier fact-checked by BoomLive in October 2017.\n\nA 2017 video of men allegedly distributing cash to women holding INC flags was falsely shared with the claim these women were receiving cash for protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019.", "lang": "en"}
