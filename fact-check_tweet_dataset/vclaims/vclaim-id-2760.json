Charter and the Helsinki Final Act, adding that, \u201cas in the past, the threat runs from the Baltic to the Black Sea.\u201d\n\nHook said the \u201cconventional threat\u201d from Russia is \u201creal\u201d and the \"military arrangement of forces in Europe favors Russia.\u201d He pointed to Russia\u2019s military capabilities demonstrated during the Zapad 2017 drills with ally Belarus and its development of a nuclear-capable cruise missile in violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\n\nQuoting another RT piece examining Hook\u2019s statements, MacDonald portrayed the official\u2019s claims as \u201cabsolute balderdash,\u201d concluding that \u201ca claim that Russia\u2019s military strength eclipses that of European Union states is especially ludicrous... Thus, it [Russia] is not stronger than the European Union, by any measure, and the State Department\u2019s Hook is spreading clear disinformation. All to serve an agenda that has nothing to do with Europe\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nMacDonald\u2019s op-ed argued that because Russia\u2019s GDP and military spending are lower than those of the U.S. and select EU states, Russia is not the threat Hook makes it out to be. However, MacDonald\u2019s analysis is based on raw numbers rather than a quantitative and qualitative assessment of capabilities. It disregards cost differentials associated with fielding military forces. It does not assess the EU states\u2019 ability to conduct effective operations individually and in concert. And it ignores Russia\u2019s intentions and military capabilities as threat factors.\n\nThe fact that EU members have more servicemen and collectively spend more money on defense than Russia does not necessarily translate into effective national or joint military capabilities. And Russia has shown it has the capability to conduct effective offensive operations in Europe.\u200b\n\nAnalysts David Shlapak and Michael Johnson argued in a piece examining Russia\u2019s and NATO\u2019s military capabilities that \u201c[w]ithout a plan, without adequate logistics, without robust command and control, a better-prepared adversary would still overwhelm NATO.\u201d\n\nAs Polygraph.info has noted: \u201cWhen the Kremlin focuses selectively on U.S. troops, it fails to mention that the defense preparedness of some European states is suspect at best amid stagnant or declining defense budgets across the continent since the collapse of the USSR in 1991.\u201d This is despite a recent push for NATO member states to increase budget contributions given the financial burden on the U.S. and need to boost allied capabilities.\n\nSteven Pifer, an expert specializing in arms control and Russia at the Brookings Institution and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, says that \u201ca major modernization program, an increased number of military exercises, and more assertive actions by Russian military aircraft near NATO airspace\u201d underscore Russia\u2019s conventional military threat to the West, which \u201ccannot ignore this.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe threat of Russia attacking a NATO country \u2013 most scenarios focus on the Baltic states \u00ad\u2013 is very small. But five years ago, most analysts would have put that prospect at zero. Kremlin actions and rhetoric have changed how the West views Russia militarily.\u201d\n\nRussia enjoys a more favorable posture and capabilities in eastern Europe, prompting initiatives by the EU and NATO to bolster their members\u2019 security.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies comparing the U.S. and Russian armies, \u201cRussia has either equaled or surpassed certain U.S. capabilities in A2/A2, ground combat, and non-kinetic operations.\u201d However, the U.S. Army still enjoys \u201can overall qualitative advantage over Russian and similar near-peer forces,\u201d despite the narrowing gap in capabilities.\n\nIn the Baltic area, Pifer notes, Russia could muster more forces in the event of hostilities: \u201cWhile NATO forces are deployed in each of the Baltic states, those provide tripwires and would require major reinforcement to be able to stop a Russian attack.\u201d\n\nJustin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, shares this assessment: \u201cRussia could quickly mass forces sufficient to overwhelm local NATO troops and it would take time for NATO to build up sufficient reserve forces to dislodge them.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. special representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, stated in July that \u201cthere are more Russian tanks in there [Ukraine] than [all tanks] in Western Europe combined.\u201d\n\nIn testimony before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee in April 2016, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley said the U.S. military is \u201ctechnically outranged, outgunned\u201d by Russia\u2019s military in Europe.\n\nRussia, for its part, has blamed the West for the so-called \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d that removed pro-Moscow regimes in Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, and Ukraine in 2003-5.\n\nIt has also accused the West of breaking a promise not to expand NATO to Russia\u2019s borders.\n\nIn August, Russia\u2019s Ambassador to NATO Aleksandr Grushko said the political situation in Europe was \u201cseriously worsening\u201d amid a \u201cpump-up of arms and armor by the NATO countries on the eastern flank\u201d of Russia on the \u201ccontrived pretense of a Russian threat.\u201d\n\nA year earlier, Russia announced it would create three new divisions to counter four battalions NATO intended to deploy to Poland and the ex-Soviet Baltic states.\n\n\u201cThe political situation along the western border of the country remains unstable,\u201d Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said a few months later, noting NATO\u2019s increased military potential.\n\nRussia has also denounced Washington\u2019s plans to deploy a ballistic missile defense system in eastern Europe aimed at protecting European allies from Iran\u2019s missiles, portraying the declared goal as a cover to undermine Russia\u2019s strategic deterrent.\n\nAnd Russia views its actions in Georgia and Ukraine as necessary to protect its own citizens, minorities, and the Russian-speaking population, as well as to ensure regional security.\n\nSince 2014, Russia has viewed Ukraine\u2019s Western-backed government as illegitimate after popular protests in Kyiv led to the ouster of Victor Yanukovych as president. Under Russian pressure, Yanukovych had refused to sign an association agreement with the EU.\n\nThe concerns of the parties aside, the balance of forces in Europe and Moscow\u2019s recent actions clearly show that Russia poses a conventional military threat to Europe.", "lang": "en"}
