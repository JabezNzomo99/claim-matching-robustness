There are also no recent reports of the group making such a call.\n\nUsing reverse image search, VERA Files Fact Check found that the photo accompanying Opinion PH\u2019s post was actually uploaded on Feb. 9, 2017 by GMA News Online. It showed solons from the Makabayan bloc in the 17th Congress after they filed a resolution calling for the resumptions of peace negotiations. They were Gabriela Women\u2019s Party Reps. Arlene Brosas and Emmi De Jesus, Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate, Alliance of Concerned Teachers Reps. Francisca Castro and Antonio Tinio, Anakpawis Party-list Rep. Ariel Casilao, and Kabataan Party-list Rep. Sarah Elago.\n\nDe Jesus, Tinio, and Casilao are not members of the current 18th Congress.\n\nIn April, President Rodrigo Duterte abandoned furthering peace negotiations with the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People\u2019s Army (CPP-NPA) saying the group lacked \u201crespect\u201d for their \u201cspoken words or deeds\u201d following the killing of soldiers on humanitarian missions.\n\n\"There is no more peace talks to talk about. I am not and I will never be ready for any round of talks...,\" he said during his April 27 address. On July 7, the president \u201cdeclared\u201d the communist rebels as terrorists, four days after signing Republic Act 11479 or The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020.\n\nAt least 30 groups so far have filed petitions with the High Court questioning the constitutionality of the law, its broad definition of terrorism and provisions on extended warrantless arrests of suspects.\n\nOpinion PH\u2019s post has received over 600 interactions on FB and could have reached over 174,000 people, with traffic largely coming from FB groups Solid Duterte Supporters Worldwide, Senator Imee Marcos Supporters, and Inday Sara Duterte Supporters.", "lang": "en"}
