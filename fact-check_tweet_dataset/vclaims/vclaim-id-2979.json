On the website of Dr. Hyman (archived here) it is written like this:\n\nBut what is more relevant the quote is pulled out of context since it is not even speaking about human brains. It occurs in the context of several paragraphs discussing a 2007 study that was done on rats which showed rats preferred getting sweetened water over cocaine injections when given the choice. But that study never claimed sugar was eight times as addictive as cocaine. It also didn't matter if the water was sweetened with actual sugar or with artificial sweeteners, it seems like it was the sweetness overall that influenced the preference of the rats in the experiment, not the presence of actual sugar.\n\nWe haven't been able to locate any other scientific evidence about the relative addictiveness of sugar vs. cocaine so we are going to go ahead and rate this claim false. Despite the total lack of evidence the video has been shared over 300,000 times which possibly proves that online nonsense can be quite addictive as well, although we'll wait for experiments on rats before jumping to conclusions on that.", "lang": "en"}
