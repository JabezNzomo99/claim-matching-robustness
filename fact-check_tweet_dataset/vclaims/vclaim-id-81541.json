Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nEvery year, 23 March is celebrated as \u2018Shaheed Diwas/Martyrs\u2019 Day\u2019 in remembrance of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. A video of \u2018DD News\u2019 on the Martyrs\u2019 Day can be watched here.\n\nThe article published by \u2018The Tribune\u2019, on 25 March 1931, regarding their execution can be found in a tweet by \u2018Prasar Bharati\u2019. \u2018The Hindu\u2019 article published on 24 March 1931 can be read here.\n\nFrom the National Archives of India portal, Factly was able to access the fortnightly reports on the internal political situation in India for the month of March 1931. These reports were sent to the British government on a monthly basis. This report makes it clear that the execution of Bhagat Singh along with Sukhdev & Rajguru took place on the evening of 23 March 1931.\n\nTo sum it up, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were executed on 23 March 1931, not on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
