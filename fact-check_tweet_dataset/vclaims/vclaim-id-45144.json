Footage shot by witnesses showed a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, with his knee on Floyd's neck for close to nine minutes as the latter stopped responding.\n\nSince then, scenes of protests, looting, vandalism and a violent crackdown by police on protesters and media persons have flooded social media.\n\n\n\nSeveral posts online, including the one below, claim that the White House was stormed by angry protesters and purportedly showed protesters on the West Lawn of the compound.\n\nThe video was also uploaded on YouTube with the Arabic title: 'America demonstrators storm the White House .. Protesters stormed the White House after killing more than one brown person.'\n\nThe archive of the Twitter post can be found here; Facebook posts here and here and the YouTube upload here.\n\nAlso Read: Trump Stops WHO Funding; To Suspend Hong Kong Preferential Treatment\n\nBOOM Live also received the video on WhatsApp with the claim that US President Donald Trump has fled the White House. The text of the forward reads: \"Protestors already broke inside White House for the first time in American history, gun fire at east gate and some sources said Trump fleed with his family to Kansas, CIA have emergency meeting in an hour!\"\n\nWhile people were protesting outside the White House, it was not stormed in by protesters. Protesters reportedly threw rocks at the White House and pulled at police barricades. Secret Service agents also reportedly shepherded US president Donald Trump into a secret bunker on Friday night.\n\nAlso Read: Mail-in Voting In US Elections: How Secure Is It?\n\nMany users on Twitter refuted the false tweet and claimed that the building was, in fact, the Ohio Statehouse.
