After Amit Shah\u2019s attempt at communal polarization by suggesting that laptops which are given out for free by UP Government are reaching people of only one community, PM Modi has also tried his hand at communal polarization. At an election rally in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Fatehpur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, \u201cRamzan me bijli athi hai tho Diwali me bhi ani chahiye; Bhedbhav nhi hona chahiye (If there is electricity during Ramadan then it must be available during Diwali too; there shouldn\u2019t be any discrimination)\u201d. The PM also said \u201cGaon me kabristan banta hai to shamshaan bhi banna chahiye (If there is a \u2018kabaristaan\u2019 (graveyard), there should be a \u2018shamshaan\u2019 (cremation ground) too.\u201d\n\nBy playing the Hindu-Muslim polarisation card by comparing Diwali/Ramzan and Kabristan/Shamshaan, BJP is defaulting to its usual tactics. Many people on social media reacted harshly to this. We have captured some of the comments here. Gur Sandhu had the following comment on this issue on his Facebook account\n\nWhy has Mr Modi shifted from the \u2018Vikas\u2019 slogan to this polarization strategy? Is he afraid that BJP is slipping in Uttar Pradesh?", "lang": "en"}
