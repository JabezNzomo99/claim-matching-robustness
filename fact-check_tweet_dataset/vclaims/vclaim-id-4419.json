In 2017 it spent closer to 0.7%, although slightly less than the UK.\n\nThe figures for Canada, Italy, Japan, France and US are largely correct.\n\nHow much is given as aid?\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) publishes figures on how much each of the 30 countries in its Development Assistance Committee spend annually on aid.\n\nThe OECD does this in both total dollars spent, and as a proportion of the country\u2019s Gross National Income (GNI), which is its annual output of goods and services, plus any income it gets from abroad. GDP on the other hand doesn\u2019t include income from abroad.\n\nIn its latest release, the OECD said the UK spent the equivalent of 0.7% of its GNI on aid in 2017. France spent around 0.4%, Italy and Canada about 0.3%, and Japan and the US spent roughly 0.2%, which is broadly what the image shows .\n\nGermany spent 0.66% of its GNI on aid, which is closer to the UN target of 0.7% than the image says. Germany\u2019s contribution hasn\u2019t been as low as the image shows since 2014, when it spent the equivalent of around 0.4% of its GNI then on aid. The image is broadly correct for each country\u2019s 2014 aid spending figures.\n\nHow much does the UK give in comparison to other countries?\n\nThe OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee is a forum of 30 advanced and emerging economy countries, plus the European Union, that work on developing aid policy. Ranking them for aid spending relative to the size of their economies, the UK came fifth after Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway and Denmark.\n\nOut of just the G7 countries, the UK spends the largest proportion of its GNI on aid. In terms of actual cash spent, using 2016 prices and exchange rates, Germany (\u00a317 billion) and the US (\u00a326 billion) spent more than the UK, which spent about \u00a314 billion.\n\nYou can see how all 30 countries\u2019 aid spending has changed over time using the OECD\u2019s interactive tool here.\n\nThe UK government has a target, enshrined in law, for \u201cofficial development assistance\u201d to equal 0.7% of GNI. The legal duty can\u2019t be enforced through the courts but the International Development Secretary has to explain themselves to parliament if it isn\u2019t met.\n\nYou can read more about how the UK\u2019s aid budget is spent in our explainer.\n\nThe OECD\u2019s definition of \u2018official development assistance\u2019 is \u201cgovernment aid designed to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries\u201d. It includes bilateral aid, from donor to recipient, and multilateral aid, that\u2019s channelled through a development agency like the UN. It can be in the form of a grant or concessionary loan.\n\nThe UK government explains more about the different types of aid here.\n\nThe aid must be \u201cadministered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective\u201d and can be in the form of grants, \u2018soft loans\u2019 with lenient terms for the borrower, or technical assistance.\n\nIt cannot include loans for military purposes, and has to go to certain middle and low-income countries. Some countries, like Thailand and Turkey, both provide aid and receive it.\n\nNot all aid money gets spent overseas. Some countries, like the UK, include money spent on refugees within their own borders during the first 12 months of their stay as official development assistance.", "lang": "en"}
