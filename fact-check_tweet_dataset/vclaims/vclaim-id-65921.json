We applied for the licence based on classical evidence of the compounds used in the medicine. We worked on the compounds and put out the results of the clinical trial before people,\" Balkrishna said.\n\nBalkrishna on June 24 shared a copy of an email sent to him by the AYUSH Ministry. \"News item related to \"Shwashari Vati\" & \"Coronyl\" for COVID 19 being publicized by Patanjali Yogapeetha, Haridwar \u2013 reg,\" reads the subject of the mail. The CEO of Patanjali caption the letter as \"The resolution of AYUSH controversy, finally!\"\n\nThe term 'Resolution' could have misled people into believing that the approval for 'Coronil' came through.\n\n It is noteworthy to mention here that the mail was just an acknowledgement from the Ministry of AYUSH. It said that the required documents have been submitted by Patanjali Ayurved. The AYUSH Ministry on June 23 issued a statement saying that \"Patanjali Ayurved Ltd has been asked to provide at the earliest details of the name and composition of the medicines being claimed for COVID treatment; site(s)/hospital(s), where the research study was conducted for COVID-19; protocol, sample size, Institutional Ethics Committee clearance, CTRI registration and results data of the study (ies) and stop advertising/publicizing such claims till the issue is duly examined. Ministry has also requested concerned State Licensing Authority of Uttrakhand Government to provide copies of license and product approval details of the Ayurvedic medicines being claimed for the treatment of COVID -19.\" Below is the entire statement:\n\nOn 25t June, Vishwas News, a fact-checking website, talked to Dr. D.C Katoch, joint advisor in the Department of AYUSH on approval of Coronil. Dr. Katoch said the responsibility of approval of the medicine and its advertisements are a responsibility of state govt. He also said that the matter is still under investigation and no decision in regard to approval of the medicine hasn't been made yet. Therefore, as of today, 'Coronil' is yet to receive approval.\n\n If you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.
