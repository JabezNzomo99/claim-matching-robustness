Maxwell and Grady are not siblings.\n\nBritish socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested July 2 in New Hampshire on multiple charges related to the sexual abuse of girls and young women by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The announcement of Maxwell\u2019s arrest was quickly followed by various rumors on social media, including the bogus claim she has contracted COVID-19, as we reported.\n\nA social media post on Facebook now falsely claims that Maxwell is the sister of Dr. Christine Grady, the wife of Dr. Anthony Fauci. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a prominent figure during the coronavirus pandemic, has been the target of fake claims himself, as public backlash to COVID-19 mitigation measures has grown.\n\nThe Facebook post shows a photo of Fauci and Grady with the caption: \u201cDr Fauci is married to Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s sister.\u201d Another post claims: \u201cDr. Anthony Fauci is married to Ghislaine Maxwell sister who changed her name from Christine Maxwell to Christine Grady[.] There Are No Coincedences.\u201d\n\nBut Grady and Maxwell are not sisters.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, who was born in France in 1961 and attended the University of Oxford, is the daughter of British media mogul Robert Maxwell.\n\nRobert Maxwell, who was a member of Parliament in the 1960s, ran the Maxwell Communication Corporation, which included the Mirror Group Newspapers, Macmillan book publishers, and the New York Daily News. While at sea on his yacht in November 1991, Robert Maxwell disappeared, and his body was recovered in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moved to the U.S. after her father\u2019s death and became a close associate of Epstein, who died in prison on Aug. 10, 2019, as he awaited his trial on sex-trafficking charges. Maxwell, who has denied involvement in the alleged misconduct, is accused of working together with Epstein to recruit and groom victims.\n\nFauci\u2019s wife, Christine Grady, is the daughter of John H. Grady Jr., who like Maxwell had been a successful businessman and politician. Grady was a mayor of Livingston, New Jersey.\n\nBut the parallels, including familial relations, end there.\n\nReuters has reported that Christine Grady has four siblings: Joanne Grady Huskey, John H Grady III, Barbara Grady-Ayer and Robert Grady.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell has six living siblings: Kevin, Ian, Anne, Christine, Isabel and Phillip, according to Reuters. (Two siblings have died.)\n\nChristine Grady is a nurse-bioethicist and chief of the department of bioethics at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. She grew up in New Jersey and graduated from Georgetown University with degrees in nursing and biology. She also earned a master of science in nursing from Boston College and a doctorate in philosophy from Georgetown.\n\nGrady met Fauci while caring for a patient. The pair have been married for more than 30 years and have three adult daughters.\n\nThe bogus Facebook post is the latest example of a viral claim that \u2014 as we\u2019ve previously written \u2014 fabricates familial and marital relationships between prominent figures.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
