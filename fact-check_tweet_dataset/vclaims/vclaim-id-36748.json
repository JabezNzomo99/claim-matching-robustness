Incidentally, with 21 out of the 27 names in the list being Muslims, there\u2019s a communal spin to the claim.\n\nThe claim in Hindi along with the viral post translates to, This is the Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s first list of 27 candidates for the Delhi assembly elections, of which 21 are Muslims. Delhiites, be careful, else it won\u2019t be long before Delhi becomes another Kashmir and you\u2019ll put an axe on your own feet. Seelampur, Okhla, Shaheen Bagh, Jasola, Nangloi, Shahbad Dairy and Khureji are prepared to vote; development and honesty won\u2019t matter.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral list is fake and the party has not made any such announcement till the time of filing this story.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe post is quite viral on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nTo verify the claim along with the viral post, we contacted AAP\u2019s IT cell head Ankit Lal, who told us that the viral list is fake. Ankit Lal said the party has not announced its candidates yet and may do so in the coming week. Media reports also suggest that AAP may announce its first list on January 14.\n\nWe also ran a search on the Internet with appropriate keywords but could not find any media report confirming the viral claim. Being the ruling party in Delhi, if AAP makes any such announcement, it will make headlines.\n\nHence, it is clear that the viral list is fake and not the actual list of AAP candidates for the upcoming Delhi assembly elections 2020.", "lang": "en"}
