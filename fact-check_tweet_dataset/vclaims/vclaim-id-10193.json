These taxes often help fund schools and local governments and can be high in urban areas such as New York. The same day as the Fox interview, Schumer held a news conference to charge that ending the property tax deduction could result in $4,300 to $5,500 in additional average taxes for homeowners on Long Island and in New York City.\n\nThe document claimed that targeted tax breaks that benefit mainly the wealthy would be eliminated. But the plan would also repeal the alternative minimum tax, the estate tax and a 3.8 percent tax on investment income that was part of the Affordable Care Act. Removing the AMT, designed to ensure that the wealthy pay at least some tax, especially might save some taxpayers a lot of money; Trump\u2019s 2005 tax return that was recently revealed showed that he paid an additional $31 million because of the AMT.\n\nSince Trump has not identified all of the tax breaks that might be eliminated, it\u2019s unclear whether those items would make up for the elimination of the AMT. Nevertheless, since the wealthy pay most of the taxes \u2014 and because this is a broad-based tax revision that reduces income tax brackets \u2014 it\u2019s safe at this point to assume that the wealthy will garner most of the benefits. Small-business owners, in fact, might be able to reduce their top rate from 39.6 percent to 15 percent under Trump\u2019s plan. So there are potentially large gains in after-tax income for wealthier Americans.\n\nBut here\u2019s the biggest change: The Trump tax plan is silent on whether it would still repeal the personal and dependent exemptions or eliminate the head-of-household category. A White House official explained that the only things off the table are mortgage interest, charitable contributions and pretax savings of retirement accounts such as 401ks. But he indicated that the personal exemption might remain in place.\n\nInterestingly, when Cohn gave \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d his hypothetical example of the $56,000-a-year family, he did not include personal exemptions in his off-the-cuff calculations. Despite the official position, that appears to be a pretty good clue to the administration\u2019s thinking. For a married couple with two or more children, that is likely to mean at least a small tax increase, according to calculations of David Kamin of New York University.\n\nBatchelder said that if personal and dependent exemptions remain eliminated, her analysis probably would not change much. \u201cI don\u2019t expect it to change dramatically provided that the unspecified features from last week are the same as his proposal from the fall,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the magnitude and direction of any change would depend on the income bands for the new rate brackets proposed last week, and he didn\u2019t specify those income bands.\u201d\n\nHowever, she said, \u201cit would significantly change the calculation if they withdrew their proposals to repeal personal and dependent exemptions and head-of-household status.\u201d But she was skeptical that would happen. \u201cAll they would have had to do is add about 10 words to the bullet points they released last week,\u201d she noted. \u201cThey chose not to do so, despite the fact that they have known that their plan raises taxes on millions of middle-class families since last September.\u201d\n\nThe new Trump tax proposal is similar to his campaign plan but differs in key respects. That makes it problematic to cite an analysis of the campaign plan, as Schumer did. But at the same time, the White House has been incredibly vague about key details of the new plan, making it impossible to assess how it would affect taxpayers in different income groups.\n\nThe key here is what happens to personal and dependent exemptions, especially because Trump decided not to increase the standard deduction as much as he proposed in the campaign. Schumer\u2019s comment may well be correct, especially given Cohn\u2019s public comments. But until further details are released, we will have to label this as Verdict Pending.", "lang": "en"}
