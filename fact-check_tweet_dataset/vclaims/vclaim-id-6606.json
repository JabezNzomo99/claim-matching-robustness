In other words, schools will be given more money from the government, but their costs are set to grow by even more.\n\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) has said that per pupil spending in mainstream schools will need to decrease by 8% between 2014/15 and 2019/20, after inflation, to account for these extra costs.\n\nAn 8% reduction in per pupil spending\n\nSpending on mainstream schools is set to increase from just under \u00a335 billion in 2015/16 to around \u00a338 billion in 2019/20.\n\nBut there are a number of \u201cpressures\u201d that schools will have to deal with during this time which the NAO have identified. These include rising pupil numbers and increasing costs from staff wages and pension schemes.\n\nBecause of these pressures the Department for Education has estimated the savings schools will need to make in other parts of their budgets. By 2019/20 schools will need to save \u00a33 billion. About 57% of that is expected to come from staffing costs.\n\nIt is these changes that amount to an 8% reduction in spending per pupil, something that the Institute for Fiscal Studies has also said and we\u2019ve written about before.\n\nThe NAO also says it doesn\u2019t know if these spending reductions \u201cwill be achieved in practice\u201d.\n\nThe rules on how money is allocated to schools will be changing too\n\nSchools have money allocated to them by their local council largely based on the number of pupils and the deprivation in the area. It can also use other factors to decide how much to allocate like how well the school has performed in the past or how many children in care attend the school.\n\nThe money councils have to give to schools in their area is determined by the government and based on how much money the council has received per pupil in previous years.\n\nThis means that there\u2019s no national set of rules for how spending is allocated to pupils across the whole country which the government says is \u201cunfair, untransparent and out of date\u201d.\n\nIt plans to introduce new funding rules for schools in 2018/19 which will make schools\u2019 budgets more certain each year but according to the NAO could mean \u201cbudgets of schools which currently have high levels of funding being reduced, and more poorly funded schools having their budgets increased\u201d.\n\nOverall school spending increased between 2010 and 2014\n\nSpending on schools, in real terms, increased by 3% overall and 0.6% per pupil between 2010/11 and 2014/15, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nIt said that spending on schools was \u201crelatively protected\u201d. Across all public services spending fell by 8% over the same period. This relative protection will continue, according to the IFS: it expects some government departments to have to reduce their spending by over a quarter by 2019/20.\n\nThis is just about \u2018mainstream\u2019 state schools in England\n\nThe National Audit Office\u2019s findings apply to \u201cmainstream schools\u201d, which are all government funded schools excluding special schools and alternative provision schools.\n\nThere were 20,179 of these state-funded primary and secondary schools in England in January 2016. These schools taught 7.8 million children and just over 6.4 million were between the age of five and 15.\n\nSpending on pupils older than the age of 15 comes from a separate pot of money.", "lang": "en"}
