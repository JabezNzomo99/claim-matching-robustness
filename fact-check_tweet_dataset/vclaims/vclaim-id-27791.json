They were talking about \u2018net migration\u2019; how many more people immigrate to the UK than emigrate abroad over the course of a year, currently estimated at 273,000. Their study, which was widely covered in the press, estimated this could rise to around 380,000 after Brexit.\n\nHowever, just a few hours later, Migration Watch unexpectedly issued a press release saying it was withdrawing the paper:\n\nWe have the original report, and have spent the day looking into their claims. Here are some key areas where we think they went wrong.\n\nWhat the numbers are based on\n\nMigration Watch says its estimates are based on the predicted effects of the government\u2019s White Paper on immigration, published in December last year. That document outlines the government\u2019s plans for a new immigration system once the UK leaves the EU, ending the free movement of EU immigrants across the border.\n\nMigration Watch\u2019s estimates show net migration from both EU and non-EU countries increasing after Brexit, with the huge bulk of that coming from a 100,000 increase in non-EU net migration.\n\nMost of the 100,000 increase is based on the assumption that, after Brexit, there would be a lower salary threshold for certain workers to come to the UK. At the moment, there\u2019s a minimum salary of \u00a330,000 for workers to get a Tier 2 Visa into the UK (with some exceptions). Migration Watch speculates that if that threshold dropped to \u00a321,000, it would mean a large increase in non-EU immigration to the UK.\n\nThere's one problem with this assumption, however: that change isn\u2019t something the government actually proposed in its White Paper.\n\nThe study overestimates immigration by looking at total visas granted\n\nBut that\u2019s not the main issue with the study. To estimate non-EU immigration, it uses visa figures to estimate future levels. But these can\u2019t be used to estimate immigration.\n\nAn immigrant is usually defined as someone who comes to the UK to live here for a least a year. If they leave beforehand, they\u2019re just considered a \u2018short-term\u2019 immigrant, or a visitor. All of the figures you tend to see about \u201cnet migration\u201d use this longer term definition of immigration.\n\nVisa figures won\u2019t just include people who are long-term immigrants \u2013 it will include people who just come for the short-term, and it will even include people who get a visa but never end up coming to the UK at all.\n\nSo visa figures far exceed actual levels of estimated immigration to the UK.\n\nMigration Watch uses a figure of 456,000 a year for the number of visas granted. But the equivalent figures put actual non-EU long-term immigration over that period at closer to 290,000. That suggests a serious overestimation of the future level of non-EU immigration into the UK.\n\nOfficial immigration estimates aren\u2019t perfect, and have been subject to legitimate scrutiny in recent years over their accuracy. Nonetheless, Migration Watch\u2019s study is conflating estimates from both sources, comparing a figure based on visa grants to one based on official immigration estimates.\n\nThe estimates are based on proposals the government hasn\u2019t made yet\n\nMigration Watch says its estimate could happen \u201cif the proposals in the White Paper become the basis of our future immigration system\u201d. But as we\u2019ve noted, its estimate isn\u2019t actually based on what those proposals said.\n\nThe main driver of Migration Watch\u2019s estimate is a large increase in the number of workers coming on a Tier 2 visa, due to lowering the minimum salary threshold for that from the current \u00a330,000 to \u00a321,000 a year.\n\nBut the government hasn\u2019t proposed lowering the threshold to this level. It has hinted that it may want to lower the \u00a330,000 in some circumstances , but hasn\u2019t committed to how far this reduction would go. According to the government:\n\nMigration Watch acknowledges in its study that the threshold is still under discussion, but this uncertainty isn\u2019t translated into its headline claims.\n\nThe Home Office told us in a statement:\n\n\u201cThese remarks [from the Migration Watch report] are inaccurate and untrue.\n\n\u201cSkilled workers will be required to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the Migration Advisory Committee recommend should be set at \u00a330,000. We will be engaging with business on this, but this it ensures we can attract the talented people we need for the UK to prosper while controlling immigration.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
