There, users jokingly suggested that anyone curious about what lay within the highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility should attempt to \u201craid\u201d the base. While this event may have started in jest, some people truly did show up outside of Area 51 on Sept. 20, 2019.\n\nHow many people showed up? Well, according to a viral picture floating around social media, thousands:\n\nThis is not a genuine photograph of the crowd outside of Area 51 in September 2019. This picture was taken in November 2014 in Nikomazi, South Africa, during a \u201ccrusade\u201d by the religious group In His Name Ministries:\n\nEach year, In His Name holds five to six mass crusades in towns and villages across Africa. These open-air events are organised together with the local churches and held over a minimum of four days. While our generous donors enable In His Name to fund everything, pastors and believers labour with our team to market and plan the event over a period of several months. All this hard work yields phenomenal results:\n\nAt least one other miscaptioned picture was being spread as if it showed the crowd outside of Area 51 in September 2019:\n\nThis image also wasn\u2019t taken at Area 51. While we have been unable to determine the source of the picture, a few red flags suggest it\u2019s fake. For one, the government facility in Nevada is not actually named \u201cArea 51.\u201d Area 51 is a colloquial name for a facility officially called Homey Airport (KXTA). In other words, it\u2019s highly unlikely that this facility has an \u201cArea 51\u201d sign on its fence.\n\nOn closer inspection, the \u201cpeople\u201d in this photograph don\u2019t appear to be real humans \u2014 or aliens, for that matter. This picture seemingly shows a group of characters in a video game.\n\nWhile these photographs don\u2019t document the \u201craid\u201d on Area 51, some people truly did show up outside of the government facility on Sept. 20. As far as we can tell, no earnest effort exists to \u201cstorm the gates,\u201d and this \u201craid\u201d has been non-violent.\n\nMick Akers, a journalist for the Las Vegas Review Journal, reported that about 100 people showed up:\n\nAbout 100 extraterrestrial enthusiasts converged at the back gate of Area 51 near Rachel to follow through on the original Storm Area 51 plan\u2026 \u2026Law enforcement officers blocked the road about a mile from the gate, with attendees walking the rest of the way. About a dozen officers were stationed at the gate, ready to act if anyone tried to breach the area. At the strike of 3 a.m. an officer with a police dog in tow, walked up from inside of the gates. Some of the crowd acted as if they were going to \u201cstorm\u201d the gates, but stopped after getting laughs from the crowd, as Europe\u2019s \u201cFinal Countdown\u201d blared from a attendee\u2019s speaker. Law enforcement officials were lighthearted for the most part about the gathering, joking with the crowd. They gave a stern warning to a man in a purple Lucha Libre mask for touching the gate as he posed for pictures.\n\nAkers also shared several authentic photographs and videos of the crowd that gathered outside of Area 51 on that date:", "lang": "en"}
