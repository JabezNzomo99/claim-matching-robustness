This means we currently have no trade deals with key allies such as Australia, New Zealand or the USA - or important growing economies like India, China or Brazil. Instead of making a deal which is best for the UK, we have to wait for 27 other countries to agree it\u201d\n\nThe EU has responsibility for trade agreements with outside countries, so the UK can\u2019t negotiate its own.\n\nThe EU does not currently have trade deals with Australia, New Zealand, the USA, or India, China or Brazil. The European Commission has a list of trade deals it has negotiated with \u201csome 50 partners\u201d around the world, but those countries aren\u2019t on it.\n\nThere is a deal being negotiated with the Americans: the so-called \u2018TTIP\u2019 agreement. The EU is also seeking to make free trade deals with Australia and New Zealand. Negotiations with India began in 2007 but seem to have stalled.\n\nAs for waiting for 27 other countries to agree, that depends on the deal, but often each member country will have to agree to an EU trade deal, as well as the EU\u2019s Parliament and Council. The government has said that this should happen for the pending deal with Canada, for example.\n\nUltimately, if we leave the EU our trade will be controlled by the agreements we have or make with other countries, including our World Trade Organisation membership.", "lang": "en"}
