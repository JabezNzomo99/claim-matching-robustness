This is false; the curfew is aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus. Authorities say 5G licences have not been issued to any firms in Nigeria -- Chinese or otherwise.\n\nThe post, shared hundreds of times and archived here, claims \u201cNigeria presidency impose curfew to allow China mount their 5G athena (sic)\u201d, asking readers to \u201cshare widely\u201d.\n\nAFP Fact Check ran multiple reverse image searches to find the original picture of a 5G mast seen in the post. We traced the image to the archives of Getty Images, which state that the picture was taken in Cardiff, UK by photographer Matthew Horwood. s\n\n\u201cA 5G mobile phone mast on April 04, 2020 in Cardiff, United Kingdom. There have been isolated cases of 5G phone masts being vandalised following claims online that the masts are responsible for coronavirus,\u201d the caption reads.\n\nOnline conspiracy theories blaming 5G networks for the pandemic fuelled attacks on 5G towers last month in some European countries, including Britain and Cyprus. Experts sharply rejected the theory, as AFP Fact Check reported.\n\nNigeria has not approved the use of 5G\n\nFollowing the spread of misinformation around COVID-19 and 5G, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) explained that 5G licences have not been issued to any telecommunication network in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is no deployment of 5G in Nigeria at the moment,\u201d the NCC said on its website in April. \u201cThe NCC back in November 2019 approved trial test for 5G for a period of three (3) months, and the trial has been concluded and installation decommissioned\u201d.\n\nAs AFP reported, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered a lockdown of two states -- Lagos, Ogun -- and the Federal Capital Territory at the end of March to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe president eased the lockdown on May 4 but imposed a night-time curfew. The move fuelled new rounds of misinformation like this misleading post about 5G installation.\n\nNCC spokesman Henry Nkemadu released another statement on May 10 reiterating that there was currently no 5G rollout in the country.\n\nThe NCC \u201chas unequivocally stated that there is no deployment of 5G in Nigeria at the moment\u201d, he said, adding that claims suggesting the opposite \"cannot be further from the truth\".\n\nAFP journalists in Lagos also confirm that there have been no signs of 5G mast installations in the state.", "lang": "en"}
