Rand Paul, who opposes the Republican Senate health care bill, says subsidies \u201care actually greater under the Republican bill than they are under the current Obamacare law.\u201d But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the average subsidy under the bill would be \u201csignificantly lower than the average subsidy under current law.\u201d\n\nIn all, CBO estimates the government will save $424 billion over 10 years (compared with current law) due mainly to reductions in government subsidies.\n\nPaul\u2019s comment came on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on June 25, as he argued that the current version of the Senate health care bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, \u201clooks just like Obamacare and still doesn\u2019t fix the fundamental flaw of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, subsidizes health insurance in two main ways: tax credits to cover a portion of the premiums for individuals who buy their own insurance, and cost-sharing subsidies paid to insurance companies to reduce out-of-pocket payments required under insurance policies.\n\nTax credits to help people buy insurance would remain at the same levels as under the ACA until 2020. But over the long-term, the Senate plan would be less generous with tax credits than the ACA.\n\nUnder the Senate bill, \u201cthe premium tax credits would be smaller in most cases than under current law,\u201d the CBO says.\n\nThe ACA provides tax credits to those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the Senate plan, tax credits would go to those earning from 0 percent to 350 percent of the poverty level.\n\nAlso, the tax credit under the ACA is designed to cap what an individual would have to pay toward premiums, based on the cost of a benchmark plan. The Senate GOP bill would use a less expensive plan as the benchmark and adjust what individuals would pay out-of-pocket for premiums based on age for those earning above 150 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nSomeone earning between 300 percent and 350 percent of the federal poverty level, for example, would pay 6.4 percent of income for an insurance policy if he or she is 29 years old or younger. The required contributions then go up with age: 8.9 percent for 30- to 39-year-olds; 12.5 percent for 40- to 49-year-olds; 15.8 percent for 50- to 59-year-olds; and 16.2 percent for those over age 59. (Under the ACA, those at the poverty level contribute 2.4 percent of income in 2020, and those earning 400 percent of the poverty level would contribute 10.2 percent, according to projections from the Kaiser Family Foundation.)\n\nAs for the cost-sharing subsidies available now under the ACA \u2014 which can lower out-of-pocket costs for copays and other expenses for those earning between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 those would be eliminated under the Senate bill in 2020.\n\nAccording to CBO, while individual cases would vary, \u201cthe average subsidy per subsidized enrollee under this legislation would be significantly lower than the average subsidy under current law.\u201d\n\nIn all, CBO estimates the government will save $424 billion over 10 years (compared with current law) due mainly to reductions in tax credits for premium assistance starting in 2020 and from eliminating cost-sharing subsidies. Those savings would be partially offset, CBO says, by \u201can increase in spending of $107 billion for short-term assistance to insurers to address disrupted coverage and access and to provide support for states through the Long-Term State Stability and Innovation Program.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the amount of subsidies provided in the Senate bill is less than what was proposed in the Republican health care bill that passed in the House.\n\nSo why does Paul say that subsidies \u201care actually greater under the Republican bill than they are under the current Obamacare law\u201d?\n\nPaul\u2019s reasoning hinges on a legal debate over the cost-sharing payments currently being paid to insurers to offset the costs for millions of low-income Americans. The subsidies are critical to the success of the Affordable Care Act, as insurers have threatened to pull out of the ACA marketplaces or dramatically increase rates if the subsidies are cut off.\n\nA lawsuit filed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives in November 2014 contended that funding for cost-sharing subsidies was never appropriated by Congress, and that government payment of those subsidies violated the Constitution and amounted to \u201cunlawful transfer of funds,\u201d as the New York Times put it.\n\nA federal district court judge last year sided with the House. But the judge stayed her decision to allow the government to appeal. In May, the Trump administration asked for a three-month delay in the appeal case, leaving the issue in limbo.\n\nIn theory, President Trump could drop the appeal and stop making the subsidy payments. In fact, he has said he could end them \u201canytime I want.\u201d But so far, he hasn\u2019t. The payments have continued as the case is under appeal.\n\nSo are those subsidy payments part of the Affordable Care Act? Paul argues they are not. And since the Republican bill would specifically sunset those payments at the end of 2019, Paul\u2019s argument is that the Republican plan amounts to additional funding beyond what is contained in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe proposed new bill funds a piece of Obamacare that is currently not funded, the cost sharing subsidies which got blocked by a court,\u201d Sergio Gor, a spokesman for Paul told us via email.\n\nGor further points out that \u201caccording to CBO, the ACA tax credits will cost $156 billion in 2017, 2018, 2019. We do not make any changes to these credits in the first 3 years.\u201d\n\nOn this point, Paul is taking a short-term (three-year) view and ignoring the long-term implications of the Senate bill, which would cut tax credits after three years.\n\nPaul\u2019s comment suggests subsidies would be more generous under the Senate health care plan than those currently offered by the Affordable Care Act. That assumes that the cost-sharing subsidies, which have been regularly paid, are not a part of the ACA. On the tax credit side, it is a short-term comment that ignores that tax credits will be reduced significantly after the first three years.", "lang": "en"}
