The virus has spread to over 100 countries, with over 140,000 confirmed cases, and nearly 5,000 deaths. In such a scenario, where fear and anxiety has taken over people, the distribution of fake news is on the rise.\n\nA photograph from \"The Eyes of Darkness\", the thriller novel by Dean Koontz has gone viral over social media with a claim that the novel predicted the coronavirus outbreak much before.\n\n\"A Dean Koontz novel written in 1981 predicted the outbreak of the coronavirus!\" reads one such tweet.\n\nDean Koontz's novel \"The Eyes of Darkness\" predicted the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe novel is a work of fiction, and hence any resemblance is a meagre coincidence. In \"The Eyes of Darkness\" novel the author made reference to a killer virus called \"Wuhan-400\" \u2013 eerily predicting the Chinese city where Covid-19 would emerge. But the similarities end there: Wuhan-400 is described as having a \"kill\u2011rate\" of 100 per cent, developed in labs outside the city as the \"perfect\" biological weapon.\n\nDifferences Between Novel Coronavirus and 'Wuhan-400'\n\n\n\nIn the novel, \"Wuhan-400\" has a 100 per cent fatality rate. While World Health Organization officials announced an average case fatality rate of 3.4 per cent. The fictional \"Wuhan-400\" has an expeditious incubation period of about four hours. However, for COVID-19, the following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure: Fever, Cough, Shortness of breath.\n\nTherefore, there is no reason to believe that the famous novel predicted the COVID-19 pandemic long before its time.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Coronavirus Outbreak: 68-Yr-Old Woman Dies In Delhi, Second Casualty In India", "lang": "en"}
