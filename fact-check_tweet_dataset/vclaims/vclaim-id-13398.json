While Mallya faces an uphill battle to save his family home from risk of foreclosure, ANI jumped the gun. There has been no such ruling from the UK High Court. This was pointed out by Vidya Ram, London based correspondent with The Hindu.\n\nTimes of India has reported that in a setback to Mallya\u2019s legal defence, \u201cchief master Marsh of the business and property courts of the high court in London threw out the majority of arguments Mallya and his co-defendants had put forward in their amended defence dated May 11, 2018 to cling onto their prized home. A 10-day trial is scheduled to take place from May 7, 2019.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the trial to decide the fate of the property will take place only next year in May and the ruling is with regard to the arguments presented by Mallya\u2019s legal team, scores of which were struck down for being unsustainable. Times of India further reports that \u201cUBS had put in an application on August 9, 2018 to strike out certain parts of the amended defence. On Wednesday chief master Marsh ruled that all except one of them should be \u201cstruck out\u201d as they were \u201cbound to fail\u201d.\n\nThe inaccuracy of ANI\u2019s news update was also pointed out by Naomi Canton, who filed the Times of India report from London.\n\nANI\u2019s tweet was posted at 6:47 pm on November 22. Half an hour later, the news agency posted another tweet with the correct information, amending the original tweet, which was online at the time of writing this piece.\n\nANI\u2018s erroneous news flash was expectedly picked up by multiple news organisations which reported that Mallya is set to lose his London mansion after the High Court in London ruled the same. This was reported by The New Indian Express, Asian Age and also flashed by The Quint, Business Standard and NDTV, among others. They have credited this news to ANI.\n\nOn the other hand, the popular Hindi publication Dainik Bhaskarreported that the UK High Court has permitted UBS to take possession of Mallya\u2019s London home, although the article did mention that the trial will take place in 2019. Divya Bhaskar which is a Gujarati newspaper and part of the DNA group, reported on its front page that Mallya\u2019s London house, worth Rs. 195 crore, has been seized. BTVI also broadcast that #London High Court has ruled in favour of UBS to take possession of Mallya\u2019s London house.\u201d India TV also reported that the court has ordered seizure of the property.\n\nWhat must be noted over here is that while the titles of these news reports mention that the High Court has ruled against Mallya, attributing this information to ANI, the content of the reports is specific, and states that trial will take place next year and Wednesday\u2019s ruling was with regard to UBS\u2019 application to the court seeking to strike down portions of Mallya\u2019s amended defence.\n\nANI has been caught on the wrong foot on multiple occasions over its reportage. This was yet another error which did not go unnoticed.", "lang": "en"}
