No, that's not true: Jacek Hugo-Bader, a well-known Polish journalist, did appear in blackface at a Warsaw parade in 2016 as part of a reporting project on street reactions to a black person. He did not do attempt to establish a Black Lives Matter movement in Poland.\n\nThe claim appeared in an article (archived here) published by Camelot Daily News under the title \"Marxist Jew Applies Black-Face To Establish a Black Lives Matter Fake-Hate Propaganda Center in Poland Where There Are Few Blacks.\" It opened:\n\nMany of you have heard of Jacek Hugo Bader. The Marxist Jewish journalist who applied black-face to his putridly ugly mug so that he could set up a Black Lives matter campaign in Poland-where there are few black people.\n\nThis is how the post appeared on Twitter at the time of writing:\n\nThe following collage appeared atop the article:\n\nThe journalist appeared in blackface at a Polish Independence Day celebration on November 11, 2016. He wrote about his experience.\n\nHere is another reporter's tweet about Hugo-Bader from 2016, which translates to English as his blackface appearance at the celebration would provoke the right wing :\n\nHugo-Bader is a journalist in Poland, perhaps known for his writings about Russia and the former Soviet Union. He is the author of several books, including \"White Fever: A Journey to the Frozen Heart of Siberia\" and \"Kolyma Diaries: A Journey into Russia's Haunted Hinterland.\"", "lang": "en"}
