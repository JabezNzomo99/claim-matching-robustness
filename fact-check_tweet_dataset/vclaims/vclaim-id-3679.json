It is.\n\nThe post was shared first on the website dailyworldupdate.com, which churns out stories that it deems satire but that are sometimes consumed and shared as fact.\n\nWhen a Facebook group called \u201cAmerica \u2014 Love It Or Leave It\u201d shared the site\u2019s special election story, one commenter responded: \u201cNo wonder our children are so screwed up today when our adult government officials are a bunch of liars and cheaters.\u201d\n\nBut there is no such thing as the \u201cthe 45th Federal Appeals Court of Westmoreland County,\u201d as the story cited. The judge referenced in the story, \u201cMarshawn Little,\u201d is not real, either, as a review the Federal Judicial Center\u2019s online directory of federal judges shows.\n\nOther special election stories on dailyworldupdate.com alleged that \u201ctrucks full of illegals casted fake votes\u201d and that \u201cvoters reported more than 470 incidents in which they tryed [sic] to vote for Rick Saccone but instead found their vote changed to Conor Lamb.\u201d\n\nAnd while those stories are false, too, they all entered a news cycle rife with actual developments about the election, including anonymous allegations of possible voting machine glitches and the real prospect of a recount \u2014 perhaps worsening confusion about what\u2019s fact and what\u2019s not.\n\nAs of March 16, Republicans were still mulling a recount in the tight race. Lamb was ahead by 627 votes in a race that had 228,378 total ballots cast, according to the state\u2019s official results. No winner has been officially declared, and a Pennsylvania Department of State spokeswoman said there are about 400 provisional, military and overseas ballots, which could still affect the vote.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say for sure until we actually have the (final) count,\u201d Matt Gorman, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, told FactCheck.org when asked about a recount request. \u201cBased on what we\u2019ve heard so far, I think it\u2019s likely.\u201d\n\nThe NRCC did request that the four counties in the 18th Congressional District \u2014 Allegheny, Greene, Washington and Westmoreland \u2014 \u201cimpound,\u201d or preserve and secure, all ballots and machines used in the election, Gorman said, and they complied.\n\nGorman said he is aware of \u201cnumerous reports\u201d of voting machine miscalibration \u2014 resulting in people\u2019s votes for Saccone registering as votes for Lamb \u2014 though he could not quantify those reports. The NRCC has launched a digital campaign seeking voters who experienced voting irregularities or issues, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear to what extent such issues existed.\n\nWanda Murren, the Pennsylvania Department of State spokeswoman, told us in an email that the four counties in the 18th District had received \u201cvery few calls from voters about calibration issues with voting machines.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of the calls were not from individual voters who personally experienced a problem with selecting their candidate of choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIn an abundance of caution, Greene County sent technicians to two polling locations to recalibrate voting systems.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe NRCC also plans to air out several other concerns, Gorman said. Those include a counsel for the GOP being restricted from observing an absentee ballot count and confusion over information on a state website about Pennsylvania\u2019s forthcoming changes to the state\u2019s congressional districts.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what, if anything, will come of those claims, but they have no bearing on the false stories about 22,000 fraudulent votes or claims that the election result has been invalidated.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nBaker, Peter and Michael D.
