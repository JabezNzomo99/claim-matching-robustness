She said the cost of health insurance would go down. She said prescription drug prices would fall. She lied. Since then, millions of Americans have lost their health care plans.\"\n\nWhen we asked his campaign team about the claim, we were linked to a Washington Post blog by Sarah Kliff from 2013. This blog, along with several other supporting documents sent to us, focuses on cancellation notices sent out by insurance providers to those with plans that were grandfathered in when the Affordable Care Act took effect.\n\n\"Grandfathered plans\" are plans that didn\u2019t meet ACA standards but were still allowed to be sold as coverage for a period of time after the ACA was enacted. The notices made people aware that their grandfathered plans were being phased out of the insurance marketplace, as explained by Kliff in her post.\n\nOn the surface, these notices can seem alarming, so we reached out to experts to see if they actually meant that people who received them lost health care coverage.\n\n\"Many of those individuals were likely eligible for subsidized coverage under the ACA and may have been able to switch onto those plans, in some cases at lower cost,\" said Sommers.\n\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows that in the years following the enactment of the health care act, the percentage of uninsured Americans ages 18-64 has steadily dropped from 22.3 percent in 2010 to almost 12 percent this year. The biggest drop during the time when the main provisions of the ACA took effect was between 2013 and 2015.\n\nThe individual mandate penalizes people who did not buy any health insurance although they could afford to by requiring them to pay a fee, subsequently causing more people to purchase insurance plans. By removing this, some Americans may not purchase health insurance because they will no longer be fined for doing so.\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Josh Hawley wrote in an op-ed for the Springfield News-Leader that \"millions of Americans have lost their healthcare plans.\" He has focused in on this issue as a part of his campaign.\n\nHawley\u2019s claim is misleading because it asserts that coverage was automatically lost. Other options and a sizable time period were given to those experiencing cancellations. Coverage was only lost if a new plan was not sought out by the individual before his or her previous plan was phased out.", "lang": "en"}
