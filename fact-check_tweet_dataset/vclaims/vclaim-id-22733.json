Let\u2019s try to check the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen searched for the news on the internet, no results were found. If such controversial comments were made by a senior leader like Digvijay Singh, the media houses will definitely cover that but no such news was found. Previously, the same screenshot but with the image of Shashi Tharoor was viral with the same claim. At that time, FACTLY has written a fact-check article on that post. According to the ANI post on Twitter, Tharoor said, \u201cThere\u2019s an extraordinarily striking metaphor expressed by an unnamed RSS source to a journalist, that, Modi is like a scorpion sitting on a Shivling, you can\u2019t remove him with your hand & you cannot hit it with a chappal either.\u201d So, his comments were twisted in the post. Now, the same fake post is being circulated again in the name of Digvijay Singh. So, there is no truth in the claims made in the post.\n\nFinally, Digvijay Singh did not say that he will beat Shivling with a chappal, if required, to defeat Modi.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
