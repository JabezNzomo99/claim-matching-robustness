Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen searched for the information on transit homes for Kashmiri Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir, the information provided by Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary, MoS in the Home Ministry, to the Lok Sabha can be found in the search results. He provided that answer on 8th Feb 2015 to an unstarred question on Rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits. According to that answer, houses for migrants were constructed in the state of Jammu and Kashmir under various packages allotted to the state:\n\n\u201cUnder Prime Minister\u2019s Package 2004, 5242 two-room tenements have been constructed in Jammu at four locations (Purkhoo, Muthi, Nagrota and Jagti) and have been allotted to the migrants. Further, 200 flats have been constructed at Sheikhpora in Budgam district (Kashmir Valley) and have been allotted to the migrants on sharing basis, who have joined the State Government service under the employment component of Prime Minister\u2019s Package 2008. Out of these 200 flats, 31 flats have also been allotted to the local migrants who migrated from their native places to other places within the Kashmir Valley.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Comprehensive Package amounting to Rs.1618.40 crore was announced by the Government in 2008 for return and rehabilitation of Kashmiri Migrants, which provided for many comprehensive facilities for the migrants e.g. provision of 3000 state government jobs, financial assistance for purchase/ construction of houses, construction of transit accommodations, continuation of cash relief to migrants, scholarship to students, assistance for self-employment, assistance to the agriculturists and the horticulturist, waiver of interest on unpaid loan, etc. The Package is being implemented by the State Government of Jammu and Kashmir. So far state government jobs have been offered to 1963 migrant youths, out of which 1597 have joined. 469 Transit accommodations have been constructed in the Kashmir Valley and allotted to the newly appointed migrant employees under the Package and one family has availed the benefit of Rs.7.5 Lakh for construction of house in the Kashmir Valley.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment of India has approved another package, on 18th November 2015, involving an estimated expenditure of Rs.2000 Crore for providing additional 3000 state government jobs to the Kashmiri migrants and construction of transit accommodations in the Kashmir Valley for the Kashmiri migrants to whom state government jobs have been provided/ will be provided.\u201d\n\nFrom the above information provided by the minister, it can be concluded that this is not the first time where Kashmiri Pandits are being given homes in the Kashmir valley.\n\nAccording to the latest information available, the foundation stone was laid for the Ganderbal transit accommodation by PM Modi on 3rd Feb, 2019. Also, Ganderbal project was part of the rehabilitation package announced in 2008 by the Congress government\n\nTo sum it up, this is not the first time that Kashmiri Pandits were provided houses in the Kashmir valley. It happened during the previous governments too.", "lang": "en"}
