While some participants attempted to paint Ford as an alcoholic or a criminal, one user shared an image which purportedly showed Ford holding a \u201cNot My President\u201d sign at an anti-Trump rally. A few hours later, that image was turned into a meme and shared on the \u201cOverpass for America\u201d Facebook page in a post attempting to \u201cintroduce\u201d their fans to Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser:\n\nThe claim that the pictured woman is Christine Blasey Ford was made up out of whole cloth, however.\n\nThis photograph was taken on 12 November 2016 at a protest against President Trump in New York City by photographer Christopher Penler. The image is available on a variety of stock photograph websites, where it is consistently presented as an image of an anonymous woman with a \u201cNot My President\u201d sign. It wasn\u2019t until Christine Blasey Ford came forward with an allegation of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in September 2018 that the picture started circulating with Ford\u2019s name attached to it.\n\nWe compared an image of Ford (right) with the woman in this meme (left) and found that other than both pictures\u2019 showing blonde white women wearing sunglasses, they don\u2019t have much resemblance:\n\nFurthermore, the same user who posted the above-displayed photograph also posted a second picture in the same 4chan thread which supposedly showed Ford at another Trump protest. But the second photograph also featured an entirely different woman:\n\nLife News used this \u201cFacts Matter\u201d image to illustrate their story about Christine Blasey Ford, despite the fact (facts do matter, after all) that the picture was actually one of a woman named Liz Darner taken at the March for Science in April 2017 and not a picture of Ford.\n\nIt appears that those who were attempting to smear Ford as some sort of unreliable partisan were simply searching for images of any woman at a Trump protest who bore a passing resemblance to Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser. This same tactic \u2014 purposefully misidentifying a face in the crowd in order to apply a political ideology to a known individual \u2014 was employed by conspiracy theorists in October 2017 to falsely link the man who killed nearly 60 people at a concert in Las Vegas to the Democratic party.", "lang": "en"}
