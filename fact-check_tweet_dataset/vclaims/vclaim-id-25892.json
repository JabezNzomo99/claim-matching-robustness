Antonio Trillanes IV\u2019s recently revoked amnesty, wrongly implicated the senator in a mutiny he was not part of.\n\nIn a press release issued by the Office of the Solicitor General on Sept. 29, Calida said President Rodrigo Duterte was merely \u201cimplementing the law\u201d when he issued Proclamation No. 572, which voids the amnesty the previous administration granted Trillanes.\n\nCalida was also quoted saying,\n\nPresident Duterte said Calida did the research on and discovered the flaws in Trillanes' amnesty.\n\nTrillanes, a former Navy officer, was not part of the Feb. 26, 2006, Marine standoff.\n\nHe was in detention at the time, since surrendering to the authorities after staging the July 27, 2003, Oakwood mutiny in Makati. Trillanes was among the 10 junior officers then-Armed Forces chief Gen. Narciso Abaya ordered July 31 to be detained at the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP), and later transferred to a Marine detention center at Fort Bonifacio on June 14, 2006.\n\nDuring prosecution proceedings for the Oakwood mutiny, on Nov. 29, 2007, Trillanes and about 30 other soldiers walked out of their hearing, proceeded to the Peninsula Manila hotel, also in Makati, and called for the ouster of then-president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nTrillanes was in detention for about seven-and-a-half years. He was freed in 2010 through a presidential amnesty granted by former president Benigno \u201cNoynoy\u201d Aquino III.\n\nProclamation No. 75, which Aquino signed Nov. 4, 2010, granted amnesty to soldiers and their supporters who participated in the 2003, 2006 and 2007 failed coups against Aquino\u2019s predecessor, Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nAt least two other government documents also indicated that Trillanes was only involved in two of the three rebellions during Arroyo\u2019s presidency.\n\nA copy of DND Ad Hoc Resolution No. 2 \u2013 a document that was also mentioned in Calida\u2019s statement \u2013 shows the name \u201cEx-LTSG ANTONIO F TRILLANES IV O-11797 PN\u201d was only ticked for the columns indicating participation in the Oakwood mutiny and Peninsula Manila Hotel siege. The box for the Philippine Marines standoff was left blank. The document endorsed the application for amnesty of Trillanes and 38 other mutineers to Aquino.\n\nThe Certificate of Amnesty, which the Department of National Defense (DND) issued the senator in January 2011, stated:\n\nOn Aug. 31, 2018, Duterte issued Proclamation No. 572 declaring the grant of amnesty to Trillanes \u201cvoid ab initio\" because Trillanes did not file for amnesty. Malacanang said the DND \u201cholds no available copy of his application for amnesty in the records,\u201d and the senator did not admit guilt to his crimes.\n\nMakati Regional Trial Court Branch 150 on Sept. 25 deemed Duterte\u2019s proclamation as having \u201cfactual and legal basis,\u201d maintaining status quo and holding Trillanes still under trial for charges of rebellion.\n\nTrillanes had posted a P200,000 bail in July 2010 when the case first went forward, and had to do so again after being arrested last Sept. 25, following the voiding of his amnesty. He is set to face a second court hearing Friday, Oct. 5, at Makati RTC 148, for coup d\u2019\u00e9tat charges.\n\nTrillanes is the second opposition senator to be arrested under the Duterte administration, after Sen. Leila De Lima, who has been detained in Camp Crame since February 2017 for alleged involvement in illegal drugs.\n\nInquirer.net, Court documents show cases vs Trillanes, et al. dismissed in 2011, Sept. 4, 2018\n\nRappler, Ex-DND panel chair, official tell courts: Trillanes applied for amnesty in 2011, Sept. 24, 2018", "lang": "en"}
