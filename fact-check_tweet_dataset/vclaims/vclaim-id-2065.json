The amount of money the government owes has mostly risen over those two decades, under administrations of both hues. In particular, the financial crisis and ensuing recession led to a considerable increase in debt from about 2008 onward.\n\nWe don\u2019t examine here how much debt, if any, particular governments\u2019 policies have caused. The facts on debt here shouldn\u2019t be taken as proving that one party is more profligate than the other.\n\nPublic sector net debt, the measure we\u2019re using here, is what the government owes to private institutions. It doesn\u2019t include money owed between different branches of the government\u2014in other words, it doesn\u2019t count what the government owes itself\u2014or the debts of banks owned by the government.\n\nIn terms of raw cash, here\u2019s how that debt looks:\n\nSo when the Conservatives say that \u201cduring the 13 years in which Labour was in power, there was an almost threefold increase in the national debt\u201d, they\u2019re right if you only take the cash amount owed into account. Public sector net debt was \u00a3347 billion in 1996/97, the year before Labour came into office, and \u00a31,011 billion in 2009/10, their last financial year in power.\n\nThat\u2019s a cash terms rise of 191% over 13 years, which compares to a 71% rise over seven years with Conservative Chancellors between 2009/10 and 2016/17.\n\nHowever, the natural rise in prices means that \u00a3347 billion was worth more in 1996 than it looks like now. Taking inflation into account, the trend looks very similar:\n\nBut the rise in public sector net debt under Labour once inflation is accounted for is a considerably lower 125%.\n\nThe equivalent figure for the Conservatives up to 2016/17 is 53%. That means that UKIP and other critics of the government are wrong to claim that \u201cthe Tories have doubled the national debt\u201d. That would only be true, in cash terms or in real terms, if you started from 2008/09, whereas the first year for which the Conservatives (and their Liberal Democrat coalition partners) can be said to be responsible for the debt is 2010/11.\n\nAs we go into at greater length in our explainer on \u201chow much the government owes\u201d, it\u2019s common to look at government debt compared to the size of the national economy. The bigger a country\u2019s GDP, the easier it is for the country to support high government debt.\n\nPublic sector net debt as a proportion of GDP was down under Labour for most of its term. But it then jumped from 36% of GDP in 2007/08 to 65% in 2009/10.\n\nAs with the big jumps in the cash amount, that reflects the impact of the financial crisis and the accompanying recession that began in 2008. The reduction in economic activity in that period meant less in tax receipts and higher welfare spending\u2014blowing a hole in the national finances. The much bigger deficits every year added considerably to the overall debt.", "lang": "en"}
