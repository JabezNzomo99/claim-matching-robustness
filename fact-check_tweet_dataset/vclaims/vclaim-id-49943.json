The fake posts also included names of five people who allegedly won previous rounds.\n\nOther posts included extra instructions, such as adding the raffle publisher\u2019s FB profile, or following his or her Instagram and TikTok accounts, to join the giveaway.\n\nAmong the posts of this nature that has gained the most traction was published by FB page Puregold Club, an account created only on July 5. This has been shared over 131,000 times and has received nearly a million comments. It has published two other similar giveaways that also used the name of Puregold and a noontime variety show.\n\nThe version posted by the netizen who plugged the raffle mechanics in his social media accounts was shared by over 1,200 people and has over 10,000 comments. A post by an account using the name of a gameshow host, on the other hand, has more than 5,200 comments and 3,500 shares.\n\nAmong the fake posts\u2019 top traffic generators are FB groups Francis Leo Marcos Change Movement, TUTOK TO WIN SA - WOWOWIN GMA TV LIVE SHOW, and DSWD Social Amelioration Program 2nd Tranche {IMPLEMENTATIONS & ANOMALY}.", "lang": "en"}
