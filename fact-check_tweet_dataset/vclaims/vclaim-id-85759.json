Morris, a former Marine infantry officer, described his 1995 SERE experience in an article for Slate: \u201cWhile I was in the school, I lived like an animal. I was hooded, beaten, starved, stripped naked, and hosed down in the December air until I became hypothermic. At one point, I couldn\u2019t speak because I was shivering so hard. Thrown into a 3-by-3-foot cage with only a rusted coffee can to piss into, I was told that the worst had yet to come. \u2026 I was incarcerated at SERE for only a few days, but my mind quickly disintegrated. I became convinced that I was being held in an actual prisoner of war camp.\u201d\n\nBut this is disputed by the CIA. Michael Morell, former deputy CIA director, said in a 2014 interview with Charlie Rose that \u201cthe information that we got after EITs from these two detainees who made it very clear that he was bin Laden\u2019s courier.\u201d He said that it\u2019s possible the information would have been discovered eventually, but the \u201cvery specific information \u2026 led us to take this particular lead \u2014 remember there\u2019s hundreds of leads out there \u2014 to take this particular lead to the top of the list.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Morell said, when Mohammed was asked about Kuwaiti, at a time when he was being cooperative, he said that the courier had left al-Qaeda. Two other detainees who are being cooperative lie and say they had never heard of him \u2014 which suggests he\u2019s \u201creally important.\u201d Then, when \u201cKSM goes back to his cell and we\u2019re monitoring the conversations and KSM tells everybody he can reach \u2018don\u2019t talk about the courier,\u2019\u201d investigators realize they have stumbled on something significant, which eventually leads to using voice samples to locate Kuwaiti in Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
