One year, in 2010, the estate tax actually was repealed \u2014 but then it came back again the next year. (It turned out that the taxes due at death were even more onerous for most people than with the estate tax in place.) In the meantime, Congress has increasingly cut the tax rate and boosted the exemptions, making it less and less likely that Americans would face the tax.\n\nThere is special use valuation that permits one\u2019s gross estate to be reduced by an additional $1,100,000. (To be eligible for special use valuation, the land must continue to be farmed for 10 years after death and one or more family members must continue to meet two tests \u2014 one involves participation in management and the other, in most instances, does not permit cash rent leasing.) There are other possible discounts as well. There is also a provision that allows the tax to be paid off over 15 years, at low interest rates (with only interest due the first five years).\n\nNeil E. Harl, an Iowa State University professor who has written several volumes on the estate tax, said that Whitt\u2019s concerns make little sense. \u201cThe average land value in Iowa as of November of 2014 was $7,943 and that value has dropped since by probably five to eight percent,\u201d Harl said. \u201cIowa is one of the top states in terms of land values.\u201d (USDA says the average value per farm acre in Tennessee is $3,600, as of August 2014)\n\n\u201cIn 2013, the last year IRS data are available, only 660 decedents nationally reported owning any farm property,\u201d Harl said. \u201cHowever, the 100 decedents with estates valued at $20,000,000 or more had an average of $5,675,730 in farm property. I have been tracking this study for several years and the most striking feature is the increase in farm assets by the super wealthy. In my view, public policy is not served by eliminating the federal estate tax which is the force behind this push to argue that ordinary farmers, bona fide farmers, are likely to pay a huge amount of federal estate tax. It simply is not true.\u201d\n\nThune\u2019s staff conceded that they could not identify a single farm that had been sold because of the estate tax, but they said some farms had to sell acreage in order to pay the tax. Moreover, they said land prices have soared in South Dakota much faster than the estate-tax exemption, which is indexed for inflation. From 2013 to 2014, farm acreage in South Dakota increased in value by 22.5 percent, to $2,070 an acre, more than any other state, according to USDA. Cropland has increased in value by 20.8 percent, to $3,430 per acre. Overall, land values in South Dakota have increased seven-fold since 2000.\n\nJodie Anderson, executive director of the South Dakota Cattlemen\u2019s Association, also said she could not name a farm that had to be sold completely because of the estate tax. But she said her family had to sell off a \u201cfairly significant\u201d amount of land to pay the tax when her grandfather died a dozen years ago. Although the estate-tax exemption has climbed in the last decade, so have land values. \u201cWe are asset rich but cash poor,\u201d she said. That is another reason why farmers are wary of the estate tax, she said: They do not have the resources to pay for expensive estate planning.\n\nThe raw facts may not entirely support the case against the estate tax, but increasingly this does not seem to matter. It has become a philosophical issue, even if in the end the data shows that that relatively few small farms or businesses appear to be affected. Ryan said the tax \u201chits the little guy\u201d\u2014and even if it may be only a handful, that\u2019s apparently all that matters.\n\nCertainly, farmers and ranchers believe they will be hit by the estate tax and do not want to be bothered with paying for lawyers to figure out ways around it. Is that enough to justify throwing out a tax that now mainly affects the very wealthy who are passing on stock portfolios that have never been subject to capital gains taxes? Is that better than an alternative that might require immediate payment of estates with capital gains (as what happens in Canada, where there is no estate tax)?\n\nThat\u2019s for the pundits to decide. We are not going to issue a Pinocchio ruling on the grounds that the issue of the estate tax has become so unmoored from the facts that it has moved into the realm of opinion. But we would urge foes of the estate tax to acknowledge that this is a problem that affects very few Americans. With land values increasing, some farmers may have a case. But the vast majority of taxpayers never have to worry about the estate tax.", "lang": "en"}
