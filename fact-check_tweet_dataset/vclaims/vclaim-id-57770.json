All of the posts mocked her pregnancy and the fact that she had been a part of the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh.\n\nSafoora is a 27-year-old M.Phil. student from Jamia Millia Islamia. She was arrested by the Delhi Police's special cell on April 10. According to a report by The Hindu, Zargar who was 14-weeks pregnant at that time, was arrested and sent to judicial custody on April 10 based on an FIR which accused her of participating in anti-CAA and NRC protests at the Jaffrabad metro station, prior to riots breaking out in the area. Reportedly, at her bail hearing on April 13, bail was granted on the grounds of her pregnancy, other medical conditions, however, as the bail hearing was underway, Zargar was remanded under another FIR, which slapped her with the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. (2) She was found to be pregnant after her arrest on April 10. The claim is absolutely false and disgusting. Speaking to The Logical Indian, a fellow student at Jamia Millia Islamia, Monika said that Safoor got married on October 10, 2018. Monika used to live in the same hostel as Safoora which was the Bi Amma Hostel, Jamia Hall of Girls' Residence. There are Facebook posts with pictures from her wedding in 2018.\n\nIn fact, there are several news reports available which mentioned about her pregnancy at the time she was arrested. \n\n Therefore, it is clear that her pregnancy was already known at the time she was arrested.
