Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Videos of Muslims being beaten up and killed by RSS and BJP in India. Fact: The posted videos are not related to any communal violence. Also, in one video, the victim is not a Muslim. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, it was found that the video is related to a mob lynching incident in Madhya Pradesh in February 2020. In \u2018The Week\u2019 article, it can be read that a farmer and his associates were attacked by a group of villagers on the suspicion that they are child kidnappers when they came to collect money taken by labourers from Khirakia village. The video of a victim narrating the sequence of events can be watched here. So, it is a financial dispute which led to mob lynching due to child-lifting rumours. The man lynched by the mob is Ganesh Khasi and the other victims are Jagdish Sharma, Narendra Sharma, Vinod Mukati, and Ravi. So, it is not a communal incident and the man lynched in the video is not a Muslim.\n\nWhen the same video went viral last year with the same claim, FACTLY had written a fact-check article, which can read here. The man being beaten by the mob is Sahil Raiyan and he was attacked when he tried to escape after shooting Madhav Singh in a land-related dispute. The Police have clarified that there is no communal angle to the incident.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, a similar video uploaded by \u2018Chanchal News\u2019 was found in the search results. The title of the video reads \u2013 \u2018The teenager was hit by a motorbike on his way to join the procession of the Prophet\u2019s birthday\u2019 (English translation). Various news blog articles can be found regarding the accident. The news articles can be read here, here and here. FACTLY could not independently verify the details of the incident.\n\nTo sum it up, unrelated videos falsely shared as \u2018RSS and BJP terrorism against Muslims in India\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
