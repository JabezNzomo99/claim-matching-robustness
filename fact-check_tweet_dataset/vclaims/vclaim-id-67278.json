Senfronia Thompson urged a boycott of Macy\u2019s department stores on the day after Thanksgiving 2013.\n\n\"The fact that Macy's doesn't support equal pay for women should stop you from shopping there on Black Friday,\" the Houston Democrat wrote, saying that her equal-pay proposal cleared the Legislature earlier this year, but \"then Macy's sent a letter to Rick Perry urging him to veto the law, which he ultimately did.\"\n\nThompson\u2019s House Bill was among 24 bills Perry June 14, 2013. It would have created state law similar to 2009\u2019s federal Lilly Ledbetter Act, which gave plaintiffs more time to sue over pay discrimination in federal courts.\n\nAn Aug. 6, 2013, in the Houston Chronicle reported that Texas Retailers Association members including Macy\u2019s and Kroger\u2019s had written Perry in May asking him to kill the legislation because, they said, it would lead to open-ended litigation and duplicate federal law.\n\nThompson spokeswoman Milda Mora told us by phone that the representative learned of the letters from the Houston Chronicle reporter in August and checked with the governor\u2019s office, which provided her with copies that Mora to us.\n\nOne written on Macy\u2019s letterhead (click or scroll down to view it) concluded, \"The federal requirements under Lilly Ledbetter are unnecessary and would be harmful to Texas employers. We urge you to veto this legislation.\"\n\nMacy\u2019s spokeswoman Bethany Charlton confirmed that her company sent the May 31, 2013, letter, which was signed by a company vice president. By email, Charlton said the company \"absolutely supports equal pay for equal work among men and women\" but believes existing laws \"provide strong remedies\" for discrimination.\n\nPerry\u2019s logic was similar: \"House Bill 950 duplicates federal law, which already allows employees who feel they have been discriminated against through compensation to file a claim with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,\" said his June 14, 2013, .\n\nProgress Texas, the pro-Democratic organization that distributed Thompson\u2019s email and is organizing the , Perry\u2019s statement that the bill would have duplicated federal law, saying that the Ledbetter protections need to be codified in state law for them to apply to cases in state courts.\n\nThe group\u2019s executive director, Ed Espinoza, told us by email that his group launched a boycott of Macy\u2019s and other retailers when the news broke in August. An Aug. 7, 2013, Chronicle said Thompson took part in that boycott also, canceling a planned appearance at a Macy\u2019s store to mark the state\u2019s annual sales-tax holiday.\n\nMora said that Thompson, who was quoted in an Aug. 9, 2013 Texas Public Radio as saying she had previously been a \"card-packing member of Macy\u2019s,\" but had not shopped there since the letters became public.\n\nThompson said \"Macy's sent a letter to Rick Perry urging him to veto\" her equal pay measure.\n\nAs the Houston newspaper reported, Macy\u2019s wrote the governor May 31, 2013, saying \"We urge you to veto this legislation.\" The claim is True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
