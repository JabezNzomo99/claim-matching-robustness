Really?\n\nWe reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign for more information on the figure, but did not hear back. However, according to data from the Census Bureau, the U.S. trade deficit with China clocked in at $343 billion in 2014. That makes Trump off by more than 31 percent.\n\nFor comparison, a $343 billion trade gap is roughly the .\n\nSo far, the trade deficit for 2015 has been calculated through September 2015, totalling almost $274 billion.

See our for more information.\n\nTrump said that \"we\u2019re losing now over $500 billion a year in terms of imbalance with China.\"\n\nLast month, Trump said almost $400 billion during a speech in Iowa. He should have stuck to that figure.\n\nThe 2014 trade deficit totaled $343 billion, and it\u2019s expected to be larger in 2015 but not more than $500 billion.", "lang": "en"}
