There was a dispute between the Nigeria Embassy and their host, Democratic Republic of Congo. This led to some Nigerian diplomats\u2019 properties being thrown out; but the issue has since been resolved, according to a Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe video that went viral on social media platforms, showed a building purportedly belonging to the Nigerian Embassy in Congo under attack with properties belonging to the embassy allegedly thrown out of the building causing serious damage. Blogs like ZenithNaija and Nairaland also featured the story, expanding further. Allegedly, it was Mr Olusola Ojemane Orevba, a Nigerian Ambassador residing in Congo that was evicted.\n\nWhen the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) contacted Mr Ferdinand Nwonye, the Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs he admitted that there was a dispute between the Embassy and their host. Further adding that the situation was being handled; as the Head of Mission had written to the Permanent Secretary\u2026\n\n\u201cI can also confirm that activities were not disrupted in our embassy in Congo. The Nigerian Embassy in Democratic Republic of Congo was not shut down. There was a dispute on one of the properties of the mission where officials were residing. When we reported the matter to the Congolese government, the country authorities intervened immediately and the property was handed back to the Nigerian mission. The mission bought the property but is still in the process of updating the documents, which are still under Zaire, former name of the country.\u201d\n\nThe cause of the dispute is still somewhat unknown. \u201cIbim Nkem Charles\u201d, one of the men interviewed in the video voiced his opinion. According to him, the building was given to the Nigerian Embassy by the host country. This, of course, is in clear contradiction with Mr Ferdinand Nwonye, claims about the embassy owing the property.\n\nAdd to the fact that the French correspondent in the video never stated the reason as to why Nigeria was issued a court order. She only remarked on a court order being issued. Still, none of the aforementioned parties provided sufficient evidence to back up their opposing views.\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The embassy building was not affected, but the residence of some diplomats was. There was a dispute between the Nigeria Embassy and its host, Democratic Republic of Congo. This led to some Nigerian diplomats\u2019 properties being thrown out; but the issue has since been resolved, according to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nEbere Agozie is a Senior Correspondent with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) with a staff strength of about 880, Joined in 2014 as a correspondent.
