The story was picked up by local television channels and widely shared on social media. But the claim is false; a major investigation by Sri Lanka\u2019s Criminal Investigation Department found the doctor had not performed any sterilisations; all of Sri Lanka's law enforcement and intelligence agencies have said the doctor has no links to terrorism.\n\nMainstream Sinhala language daily newspaper, Divaina, published this story on May 23, 2019 which claimed that some 4,000 Sinhalese Buddhist women had been sterilised without their knowledge by a Muslim doctor at a hospital in Kurunegala, a town in Sri Lanka\u2019s northwest.\n\n\u201cThawheed Jamath doctor has sterilized Sinhala Buddhist mothers after C-section surgeries. Details revealed with proof. Widespread investigations carried out to arrest the doctor\u201d.\n\n\u201cThawheed Jamath\u201d is a reference to National Thawheed Jamath, an Islamic group that Sri Lankan authorities have blamed for the Easter Sunday attacks on April 21, 2019, which left more than 250 people dead. Here is an AFP report on the attacks.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Divaina report:\n\nThe Divaina report claims the secret sterilisations were performed by tubal ligation while the women were undergoing cesarean section surgeries.\n\nSubsequent Sri Lankan media reports, for example here in the English-language Sunday Times newspaper, identified the doctor as Seigu Shihabdeen Mohamed Shafi and said he was arrested by Kurunegala Police on May 24, 2019.\n\nMultiple local television channels picked up the Divaina report, for example, this report by Hiru TV, and this clip uploaded by Sinhalese-language Derana on May 25, 2019 titled: \u2018A Kurunegala doctor who performed over 8000 C-sections arrested\u2019.\n\nMultiple posts on Facebook shared screenshots of the Divaina front page report or the television clips, for example here and here.\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhalese-language caption says: \u201cRealise the danger now? This is Wahabism. He is a worse terrorist than the terrorist who carried out the bombings.\u201d\n\nThis Facebook post, uploaded May 23, 2019, called for the doctor to be given \u201cpunishments meted out during the era of ancient kings\u201d -- a reference to torture.\n\nCiting the purported sterilisations as justification, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most senior Buddhist figures, Asigiri Chapter Prelate Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana, publicly called for the doctor to be stoned.\n\nThe false reports were also shared in India, for example this June 9, 2019 tweet, alongside calls for an investigation into whether Hindus were being sterilised.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the tweet:\n\nThe claim is false; an investigation by Sri Lanka\u2019s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) which was presented in court hearings found that the doctor in question, Seigu Shihabdeen Mohamed Shafi, had not performed any sterilisations.\n\nShafi was arrested on May 24, 2019 and charged under Sri Lankan terrorism laws on May 27, but the CID probe found no evidence of his involvement either in sterilisations or terrorism and called for him to be released, according to court documents seen by AFP.\n\nThe case accusing him of mass sterilisation was brought before the Kurunegala Magistrate\u2019s Court on June 27, 2019 and, in a 210-page report submitted to the court, the Criminal Investigation Department of Sri Lanka said no evidence was found to link Shafi to non-consensual sterilisation procedures, adding that the Divaina report was baseless.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant section of the report:\n\n\u201cAn investigation was carried out on the lead story of the Divaina newspaper published on 2019.05.23 titled \u2018Thawheed Jamath Doctor has sterilized 4,000 Sinhala Buddhist mothers after cesarean operations details revealed with proof widespread investigation to arrest the doctor\u2019, under the instructions of the Inspector General of the Police. According to the statements obtained so far, the said story has been mentioned to the journalist who drafted the news by the Kurunegala Deputy Inspector General, as follows - \u2018...there are rumours of sterilisation procedures having been performed.\u2019 The investigation into the newspaper report has revealed that this journalist, Hemantha Randunu, published the news item without necessary verification of facts.\n\n\u201cI would like to respectfully report to Court that considering the above mentioned observations, the suspected Dr. Shafi is presently being detained under the Section 9 (1) of the 1979 No: 48 Prevention of Terrorism Act (temporary provisions) since 2019.05.27 for a period of 90 days upon obtaining a detention order to proceed with the investigation. As it is not justifiable to hold the suspect under the stated regulations to investigate, steps will be taken to bring this before the attention of the State Defense Minister and take necessary action.\u201d\n\nAccording to the documents seen by AFP, the CID investigation, led by Inspector Adrian Nishantha Silva, interviewed more than 40 employees at the Kurunegala Teaching hospital, including operating room nurses, OBGYN specialists, resident doctors and hospital attendants, who had worked with Shafi.\n\nThe CID report said that some of the staffers had assisted Shaffi in over 500 C-sections.\n\nAccording to the witness testimonies cited in the CID report, no one witnessed Shafi \u201cusing his hands or any surgical equipment to damage the fallopian tubes\u201d of any patient on the surgical table.\n\nThe court records show that the complaint against Shafi was lodged by Kurunegala Deputy Inspector General Kithsiri Jayalath on May 22, 2019, who accused him of aiding ISIS suicide bombers in Sri Lanka.\n\nAccording to reports from all of Sri Lanka law enforcement and intelligence agencies, including police, the State Intelligence Service, and the Terrorist Investigation Division, there is no evidence of Shafi having any links to terrorist activity.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant section of the report:\n\nThe documents translate as: \u201cTo determine whether this suspect has links to any other crime, terror activity or check if he is a wanted suspect, reports have been obtained from defense and law enforcement agencies and the response by each agency is listed below.\u201d\n\nThe document then lists 13 Sri Lankan law enforcement and intelligence agencies, all of which cleared Shafi of terrorist links -- Kurunegala Police, Police Special Task Force, State Intelligence Service, Criminal Archives, Terrorist Investigation Division, Western Intelligence Unit, Police Special Bureau, Dambulla Police Station, National Intelligence Bureau, Intelligence units of the army, navy, airforce.", "lang": "en"}
