That is not true. The main problem is crime in the black community,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cWhen you start doing this stuff that the [New York] mayor [Bill de Blasio] is doing, the president is doing, the attorney general is doing, they are perpetuating a myth that there is systemic police brutality. There is systemic crime. There is occasional police brutality.\u201d\n\nFormer Congressman Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) has been tweeting on this topic. In an e-mail to The Fact Checker, Walsh said he believes de Blasio, Holder and Obama \u201chave the blood of those two NYPD cops who were killed this past weekend on their hands.\u201d All three \u201cresponded by stressing how racist America still is, how understandable urban black anger is toward the police, and how police need to re-train and reform. They put all the onus on the police and created the clear atmosphere for people to be angry at and disrespectful toward police. \u2026 What they should have done is come out and say succinctly \u2014 \u2018The judicial system has spoken, respect the decision, cops are good, don\u2019t resist arrest, never ever attack a cop, and don\u2019t you dare riot, loot, and burn.'\u201d\n\nObama gave an update two days later, speaking directly to the violence in Ferguson. He said he expressed concern about the violence to Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D). \u201cThere is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There\u2019s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights,\u201d Obama said in his statement.\n\nOne statement from this briefing seems to directly contradict claims that Obama immediately took the side of the protesters, thereby launching \u201canti-police rhetoric\u201d: \u201cI have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed because, although these are issues of local jurisdiction, the DOJ works for me, and when they\u2019re conducting an investigation, I\u2019ve got to make sure that I don\u2019t look like I\u2019m putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other.\u201d\n\nAfter a grand jury decided not to indict officials in the case of Garner\u2019s death, Obama said \u201claw enforcement has an incredibly difficult job \u2026 there\u2019s real crime out there that they\u2019ve got to tackle day in and day out \u2014 but that they\u2019re only going to be able to do their job effectively if everybody has confidence in the system. And right now, unfortunately, we are seeing too many instances where people just do not have confidence that folks are being treated fairly.\u201d He added that it was his job as president to solve the problem of people not being treated equally under the law.", "lang": "en"}
