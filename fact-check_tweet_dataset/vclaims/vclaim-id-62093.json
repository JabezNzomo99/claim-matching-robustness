The data shows an increase of 372 insecurity-related incidents within the same six-month period when compared with that of five years earlier, though there was reduction in the number of deaths recorded.\n\nAlso, the NST data shows that the Boko Haram insurgency tops the list of causes of insecurity-related deaths in Nigeria between January 2015 and June 2015, followed by Kidnapping, Banditry and Sectarian violence respectively, among others, within the same period.\n\nWhereas, between January 2020 and June 2020, Kidnapping and Banditry top the insecurity list, followed by Sectarian violence and the Boko Haram insurgency.\n\nThe FackCheckHub reports that the NST is a project of the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Africa programme, which documents violence in Nigeria that is motivated by political, economic, or social grievances. The data are based on weekly surveys of Nigerian and international media.\n\nThough it noted on its website that \u201crelying on press reports of violence presents methodological limitations as there is a dearth of accurate reporting across certain regions; death tolls are imprecise, and accounts of incidents vary, the NST makes every effort to collect information from multiple sources.\u201d\n\nIn addition, using a 12-month range, the NST data shows that a total of 1,574 incidents which led to loss of 8,845 lives happened from July 2019 to June 2020. Whereas, a total of 15,106 people died from 931 incidents which occurred from July 2014 to June 2015.\n\nIrrespective of the range use \u2013 6 or 12 months \u2013 the number of insecurity incidents in 2020 is higher than five years ago.\n\nFurther findings by The FactCheckHub also corroborated Campbell\u2019s report of heightened insecurity in Nigeria when compared to five years ago.\n\nA report published on Friday, July 24, 2020 by the Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPs) \u2013 a consortium of three non-profit organisations (NGOs) \u2013 which include the Norwegian Refugee Council, Mercy Corps and Save the Children revealed that violent attacks especially by bandits in Nigeria\u2019s North-West region has led to death and displacement of citizens in their thousands.\n\n\u201cAttacks have included shooting and killing, cattle rustling, kidnapping, rape, torching of entire villages, and looting of valuables, and the numbers of fatalities and displaced people have continued to rise,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe six states of the North West, according to the report, are Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, Kaduna, Niger and Kebbi.\n\nIn addition, the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, July 31, 2020 also expressed worries over rising insecurity, contrary to the Army Chief\u2019s claim, saying \u201cWhat is coming up in the northwest and north central is very, very disturbing indeed,\u201d The Guardian (Nigeria) newspaper reported.\n\nThe data from NST covers cases of insecurity across the country and not all of these cases fall under the purview of the Army \u2013 Military, but incidents of insecurity \u2013 the state of being open to danger or threat \u2013 have increased across the country.\n\nThe country is witnessing a heightened spate of banditry, kidnapping among others.\n\nFrom the information presented above, Buratai\u2019s claim that \u2018Nigeria is safer now than we had five years ago\u2019 is MOSTLY FALSE. This is because even though death fatalities reduced in the period under review, there is a rise in insecurity incidents.", "lang": "en"}
