A reader also emailed the post to Rappler for verification.\n\nThe photo was taken in Zhejiang Province, China in 2011 \u2013 way before the first case of COVID-19 was recorded in December 2019. (READ: TIMELINE: The novel coronavirus pandemic)\n\nA reverse image search showed that the photo was used by Hainan Daily\u2019s online news service hinews.cn in an article published on January 5, 2011.\n\nThe report said that a company\u2019s chairman and other officers, dressed in black suits, greeted their rank and file employees with a bow on January 3, 2011, the first working day of that year. The report did not identify the company but said it was located in Taizhou City.\n\nIn February, a supposed photo of a Japanese medical team sent to Wuhan, China to help out with COVID-19 also circulated on social media. Rappler debunked the claim because the photo was taken in 2008 when a medical team from Japan helped out in China after the Sichuan earthquake.\n\nAs of Monday, August 10, the global death toll due to COVID-19 reached 727,288. Nearly 20 million cases have also been registered worldwide. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
