No, that's not true: Although Jay Z was close to the slain rapper, Lead Stories has been told by a source close to the Nipsey's family and another source inside Jay Z's circle that the report is false. Nipsey Hussle left his family financially stable and is not in need of charity, according to the family source.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on April 4, 2019 titled \"Jay Z creates $15 Million dollar trust fund for Nipsey Hussle kid's\" by the website HipHopOverload.com, (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nJay Z is the GOAT for many reason's not just for his rap skills. Jay is back at it again for his people! Jay Z and RocNation will be creating/donating $15 Million dolalrs to a trust fund which is set up for Nipsey Hussle's kids. Nipsey signed a management deal with Jay Z and RocNation so it is only right that Jay take care of Nipsey since this heart breaking event happened. The trust fund will have Lauren London has the executive of it and she can disburse and manage the money how she pleases. That is what RocNation reps told us when we reached out.\n\nNipsey Hussle, 33, was fatally shot in Los Angeles on March 31, 2019, allegedly by a lone gunman named Eric Holder.\n\nThe publisher of the debunked report insisted to Lead Stories in a text exchange on April 4, 2019, that he was standing by his unidentified source who worked with RocNation, the entertainment company founded by Jay Z. Hussle was signed to the RocNation record label. But a Lead Stories source that we know to be close to Jay Z -- but who asked to be unnamed in this story -- assured us \"the report is inaccurate.\"\n\nWhen Lead Stories asked the website for any addutional sourcing or information, we were directed to the Instagram account of Ceasar Emanuel, the reality TV star and owner of Black Ink Tattoo Studio. When we contacted him, he said \"I just retweeted\" the story and could not confirm it was true.\n\nThe report claimed that the $15 million trust fund would be controlled by Lauren London, Hussle's longtime girllfriend and mother of his child. The family source told Lead Stories that London was too distraught to speak to us about the matter at the time.", "lang": "en"}
