The accounts are false, using stolen imagery and made up claims to lure people into clicking onto advertising.\n\nThe reports, such as this, touch on a sensitive issue for the Philippines because about 10 million of its nationals are deployed abroad as migrant workers.\n\nThe overseas workers provide a lifeline to the economy, but regularly report being abused by their employers. The false sexual abuse reports prey on those fears to lure people into clicking onto advertisements.\n\nOn Facebook, the fake sexual abuse reports are accompanied by the image below.\n\nThe headline, when translated to English, says: \u201cFilipino nurse in Saudi in critical condition after he was raped by 5 Arab men\". It then alleges he was also abused with a Coke bottle.\n\nClicking on the link leads to a website with the same headline.\n\nOther websites with similar accounts, such as this, say the Filipino nurse died.\n\nThe accounts include an image of a bandaged man lying on a hospital bed.\n\nHowever that picture is of another Filipino who was beaten in Riyadh. The original image was posted on a crowdfunding website for the victim before the fake news reports emerged.\n\nThe fake posts also include a picture of a man in hospital worker clothes.\n\nHe is John Paul \u201cJap\u201d Nofuente, a nurse who told AFP that he worked in the Philippines and had never been employed abroad nor travelled to Saudi Arabia.\n\nNofuente sent to AFP via Facebook messenger the original image that the fake news sites had used without his authorisation. The image sent to AFP is below.\n\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t gone to Saudi,\u201d Nofuente told AFP on August 7.\n\nNofuente also wrote a Facebook post saying the reports were false.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t believe everything you read on social media. Kindly report the article if it appears on your timeline. Thank you,\u201d he posted on Facebook on August 4.\n\nThe fake reports have been shared more than 45,000 times to Facebook pages with hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nThey are clickbait leading to advertisements.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the posts, which includes an invitation to click on a fake Facebook survey that leads to further advertisements.", "lang": "en"}
