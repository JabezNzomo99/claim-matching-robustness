The posts purport to compare offender rates based on race and statistics on police killings. They were shared as large anti-racism protests were held across the US over the police killing of George Floyd. The claims are false; a US criminologist said the statistics are \u201cbogus\u201d; the San Francisco Police Department said the \u201cCrime Statistics Bureau - San Francisco\u201d cited in the posts does not exist.\n\nThe text graphic was shared on Facebook here, here and here. The image states 97% of black and 81% of white murder victims are \u201ckilled by blacks\u201d, and just 16% of white murder vicitms are \u201ckilled by whites\u201d.\n\nThe post circulated as major US cities were put under curfew following large anti-racism protests over the police killing of 46-year-old African-American George Floyd.\n\nOther Facebook posts featuring the graphic can be seen here, here, here, here, and here.\n\nAnother version of the graphic, which excludes the purported source, can be seen in Facebook posts here and here. A separate graphic displaying the same purported data was also published here, here, here, and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claims, however, are false.\n\nA spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department told AFP by email on June 19, 2020 that they are \u201cnot familiar with any \u2018Crime Statistics Bureau'\". The spokesperson noted legitimate sources of crime data include the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting program and the State of California\u2019s Department of Justice.\n\nJustin Nix, an associate professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, also told AFP via email on June 23, 2020 the statistics in the graphic were \u201ccompletely bogus.\u201d\n\nNix pointed to the FBI\u2019s known race/ethnicity homicide data for 2015, which show significantly different percentages than the misleading graphic. The percentages based on the FBI\u2019s data are as follows:\n\nNix added, however, that \u201cmany homicides involve an unknown perpetrator, making it impossible to estimate the percentages shown in that graphic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the FBI, there were 7,039 Black people and 5,854 White people murdered in 2015. But nevertheless, it\u2019s well established in Criminology that most crime is intraracial,\u201d Nix said.\n\nRegarding police killing statistics, Nix said US figures are \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d but pointed to The Washington Post\u2019s database on fatal police shootings, which Nix said accounts for \u201c~95% of all police killings\u201d.\n\nAccording to the database, which categorised victims by race, there were 994 fatal police shootings in 2015. The victims included 258 black people and 497 white people.\n\nNix added: \u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect, but we could add those numbers into the FBI homicide figures above to get the following: \"\n\u2022 258 / 2922 Black people killed in 2015 were killed by a police officer (9%)\n\u2022 497 / 3664 White people killed in 2015 were killed by a police officer (14%)\".\n\nMapping Police Violence, an independent research group, recorded even more total police killings than The Washington Post, claiming that police killed at least 1,152 people in the US in 2015.\n\nThe misleading graphic was also previously debunked in 2015 by Politifact and FactCheck.org after then presidential candidate Donald Trump retweeted the image.", "lang": "en"}
