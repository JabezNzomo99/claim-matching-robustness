The reporter who cannot be seen asks, \"So, you don't really want answers?\" which triggers the filmmaker's animated response saying there are no answers.\n\nThe clip is being shared after Sushant Singh Rajput's death led to a debate around nepotism and criticism of actors belonging to 'film families'. Following this, online campaigns to boycott such films, led to the trailer of Sadak 2 receiving over 11 million dislikes on YouTube within days of its airing. Sadak 2 is produced by Bhatt and stars his daughter Alia Bhatt and actor Aditya Roy Kapur.\n\nThe caption on the post translates to,\"After getting 10 million (1 crore) dislikes on Sadak 2, see how Mahesh Bhatt has become mad, the result of unity of Hindus, do not stop friends.\"\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nBOOM also received the viral clip on its WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111)\n\nA keyword search fo Mahesh Bhatt + there are no answers' showed articles from December 2019.

Soni Razdan, sitting next to Mahesh Bhatt, also tries to calm him down.\n\nAfter which Alia Bhatt says into the mic, \"I warned you that this was gonna happen,\" as Mahesh Bhatt goes on to say, \"I have never pretended to my children that I was in possession of the virtues that people flaunt.
