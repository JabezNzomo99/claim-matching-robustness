But while Kyari has indeed tested positive for the virus, there is no evidence to support the claim that Buhari was infected with COVID-19. The picture of the alleged broadcast was fabricated using another screenshot of a CNN show.\n\nThe doctored image of a CNN broadcast appears in several Facebook posts in Nigeria, including on this page called \u201cNG News Reporters\u201d. The post has been shared more than 2,500 times since its publication on March 26, 2020.\n\nThe screenshot shows CNN journalist Anderson Cooper and the US Senate\u2019s top Democrat Chuck Schumer in a TV segment alongside an image of Buhari and Kyari, and a breaking news ticker reading: \u201cNigerian President Muahmmadu Buhari and Abba Kyari tested positive for coronavirus, Government hiding Muahmmadu Buhari\u2019s real result (sic).\u201d\n\nAccording to the post, CNN reported the Nigerian government hid Buhari\u2019s COVID-19 test result after he tested positive for the virus alongside Kyari.\n\nUsing social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, AFP traced the story to a website called Akelicious.net. The web publication, archived here, was widely shared on Facebook, including here and here.\n\nSocial media posts claiming various presidents tested positive for COVID-19 have been widely shared across the West African region. AFP recently debunked a similar claim that Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo and a senior minister Yaw Osafo-Marfo tested positive for the virus.\n\nVisible text such as \u201cCapitol Hill\u201d and \u201c8:07 PM ET\u201d at the top right-hand corner of the viral television screenshot suggests Senator Schumer called into a CNN programme from Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., United States.\n\nAFP ran a keyword search on Google for \u201cSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Anderson Cooper\u201d and found this March 18, 2020 report published on American news website Real Clear Politics.\n\nThe news report was posted alongside a video clip of CNN\u2019s Cooper featuring Schumer on a television programme. The physical appearances of the two men and other features on the TV screen such as \u201cCapitol Hill\u201d show the viral image was indeed shot on a CNN broadcast at around 8:00 PM Eastern Time on Wednesday, March 18, 2020.\n\nComparing the time and date with the CNN program schedule, AFP confirmed that Senator Schumer was speaking on the \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\u201d programme on CNN.\n\nHowever, while the image of the purported CNN broadcast was shot at 8:07 PM Eastern Time, the 73-second clip started at about 8:11 PM Eastern Time.\n\nAFP conducted another search on Twitter for \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\u201d and found the TV show\u2019s official Twitter account. The account\u2019s tweet feed contains key interview excerpts from the show\u2019s previous editions, including this longer version of Cooper\u2019s interview with Senator Schumer. The senator was speaking on the impact of coronavirus on the US.\n\nA comparison of the two images shows the viral image has been manipulated to add a CNN Breaking News ticker, while a preview of an oncoming CNN\u2019s show was covered with an image of Buhari and Kyari.\n\nKyari contracted COVID-19 after travelling to Germany but Buhari tested negative for the virus. The outcomes of their tests were widely covered in Nigerian media, including in this AFP report.\n\nThere is no evidence that Buhari tested positive for the virus as claimed in the viral television screenshot.\n\nNigeria reported the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in sub-Saharan Africa on February 27, 2020. Since then, the figure has risen steadily to at least 232 cases including five deaths, as of April 5, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
