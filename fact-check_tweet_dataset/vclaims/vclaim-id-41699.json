The article originated on a satirical news website.\n\nThe website Dachshund Daily published an article on March 8 that claims the \u201cSix Million Dollar Man\u201d actor, who purportedly died during a surgical procedure, left $6 million to Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign in his will. Multiple Facebook users subsequently shared the article.\n\n\u201cMajors left 66% of his sizeable $9 million bequest to Trump 2020 \u2013 a representative aggregate of $6 million,\u201d states the article. \u201cA portion from his will indicated his adoration for our President.\u201d\n\nThe article also quotes an alleged section of the actor\u2019s will. (RELATED: Have Jennifer Aniston And Other Stars Decided To Start A \u2018Celebrities For Trump\u2019 Company?)\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has demonstrated the administration and quality that this nation has needed for quite a long time,\u201d reads the supposed clause. \u201cMy commitment will go to him yet will truly be for America. The sum is bionic. I trust it gives the USA power. I know Steve Austin would affirm.\u201d\n\nMajors has not died, however. His wife recently posted a series of photos on Instagram to wish Majors a happy birthday on April 23, saying, \u201cHAPPY BIRTHDAY SWEETHEART!! You are loved, adored, cherished, appreciated and celebrated today and everyday!\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any Federal Election Commission records showing that Majors has donated to Trump in the past. He and his wife attended a Christmas party at the White House in 2018, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe claim appears to have originated on Conservative Tears, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d The article, which put up the headline \u201c\u2018Bionic Man\u2019 Lee Majors Dead At 83;$6 Million Left To Trump 2020,\u201d is satirical in nature and should not be treated as fact.", "lang": "en"}
