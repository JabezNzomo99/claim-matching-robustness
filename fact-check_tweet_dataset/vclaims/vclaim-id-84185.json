The claim is false; the image actually shows the official final tally of the country\u2019s 2014 presidential election.\n\nThe image can be seen in this April 21, 2019, Facebook post, which has been shared 12,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe image contains an infographic which shows that 53.15 per cent of votes, represented by a red bar, were in favour of \u201c02\u201d and 46.85 percent of votes, represented by an orange bar, went to \u201c01\u201d.\n\nWidodo\u2019s ballot number in the April 17, 2019, elections was \u201c01\u201d and the ballot number of his sole challenger, Prabowo Subianto, was \u201c02\u201d. Here is the General Elections Commission, or KPU, announcement on the ballot numbers for each candidate.\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s translated caption reads: \u201cAn admin. Even though this fact is devastating, this is what Allah wants.. At the end, we, the fanatic supporters of Jokowi, have accepted the results. Hopefully this would bring joy. May peace prevails!\u201d\n\nBut the picture does not show Indonesia\u2019s 2019 polls results.\n\nThe translated headline of the bar chart depicted in the Facebook image reads: \u201cRESULTS OF COUNTED VOTES FROM EVERY PROVINCE AND OVERSEAS IN THE 2014 PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\u201d.\n\nAFP typed the Indonesian-language headline into a Google keyword search and found the image was originally published in this July 22, 2014, post on the website of the general elections commission regional office in Indonesia\u2019s Mandailing Natal regency.\n\nThe original post is headlined: \u201cKPU announces results of the 2014 presidential and vice presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe infographic is giving the results of the 2014 presidential election, which was also contested by Widodo and Subianto.\n\nAt that time, Widodo\u2019s ballot number was \u201c2\u201d and Subianto\u2019s \u201c1\u201d. Here is a 2014 report by Indonesian news portal Merdeka.com on the candidates and their ballot numbers.\n\nThis July 22, 2014, report by Indonesian news outlet Merdeka.com about Widodo\u2019s victory in the election also has a screenshot of the identical image as seen in the regional KPU office website.\n\nBelow is a side-by-side image comparing the Facebook image and the one obtained from the KPU regional office's website:\n\nThe misleading Facebook image has added the numbers \"01\" on the orange bar and \"02\" on the red bar, and removed the names of the presidential and vice presidential candidates from the original 2014 infographic.\n\nAccording to the KPU's official schedule which can be seen here, the official vote count for the 2019 elections will only finish on May 22, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
