Trump Foundation, and conflates it with allegations about the Eric Trump Foundation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s namesake charitable foundation agreed to cease operations in late 2018 as part of an agreement with New York\u2019s attorney general, who alleged that the nonprofit organization was improperly leveraged to further Trump\u2019s business and political interests. A November court order resolved the lawsuit, and Trump ultimately paid a total of $2 million in damages to eight charities, which also received equal portions of the foundation\u2019s remaining $1.8 million.\n\nBut it is not the case, as viral social media posts claim, that the Trump family was \u201cdisallowed from operating ANY charity\u201d in New York \u201cbecause they stole from a kids cancer charity.\u201d That distorts the facts on a number of fronts, including by conflating two separate matters.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s wrong to say the family was \u201cdisallowed\u201d from operating a charity in the state. There was no such stipulation in the settlement with the attorney general.\n\nWhile the attorney general\u2019s lawsuit initially asked the court to bar Trump and his grown children who sat on the foundation\u2019s board from serving as any charity\u2019s \u201cofficer, director, trustee or equivalent position\u201d for a period of time, the settlement reached did not do that.\n\nInstead, the agreement imposes a number of requirements that the president must meet if he \u201cdecides to serve as an officer or director of a pre-existing charitable organization\u201d \u2014 or \u201cform a new charitable organization and serve as an officer or director thereof\u201d \u2014 in New York. For example, if Trump were to start a new organization, he would need to \u201cprovide Annual Reports to the Attorney General for 5 years.\u201d\n\nIt also required Trump\u2019s children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump \u2014 to participate in \u201cmandatory training\u201d relating to charitable organizations, which the three have already undergone.\n\nThere also was no part of the state\u2019s lawsuit that dealt with allegations that the Trump Foundation \u201cstole from a kids cancer charity,\u201d as the posts claim.\n\nThat detail appears to stem from a 2017 Forbes story that alleged Eric Trump\u2019s separate nonprofit organization, the Eric Trump Foundation, engaged in self-dealing and misled donors.\n\nThe magazine wrote that the foundation publicly proclaimed that all proceeds from its annual golf tournament at a Trump golf club would go to St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. However, while the foundation did donate millions to that organization, it also made large payments to the Trump Organization to host the event and some funds were directed to different charities, Forbes found.\n\nWhile the New York attorney general\u2019s office said it was \u201clooking into\u201d the findings of the Forbes report back in 2017, those allegations were not part of the lawsuit involving the Donald J. Trump Foundation.\n\nEric Trump has since resigned from his foundation, which has rebranded as Curetivity.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
