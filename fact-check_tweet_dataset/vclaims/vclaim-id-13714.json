To start with, the first phase of Lok Sabha elections in MP will begin on April 29, but the post made on April 10 claims, \"Twenty-four hours before voting starts in Madhya Pradesh...\"\n\nSo the claim regarding the date turns out to be completely false as voting in MP will start much later, not 24 hours after April 10.\n\nTo verify the claim of EVM tampering, we did a thorough Google search by typing 'EVM tampering in Madhya Pradesh before Lok Sabha election 2019'. We found nothing as far as the claim is concerned.\n\nWe found several news reports on EVM tampering in Madhya Pradesh going back to 2018, which were related to the assembly elections and bypolls. There were reports in Indiatimes.com and Firstpost, apart from other newspapers and websites which clearly report on the issue.\n\nIn March 2018, the Madhya Pradesh government suspended the district collector and SP in connection with the tampering row. The Election Commission had also asked for a report on that.\n\nIndia Today also reported another incident of EVM tampering in MP on December 1, 2018, saying that members of the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party guarded EVM machines to ensure that they don't get tampered with.\n\nThough there are several reports of EVM tampering from MP in the past, there has been no such incident reported before this year's Lok Sabha elections as of now.\n\nFor further confirmation, we contacted our correspondent Hemendra Kumar Sharma, who is based in Bhopal. He confirmed that there has been no instance or any accusation of EVM tampering this year and the claim is totally false.", "lang": "en"}
