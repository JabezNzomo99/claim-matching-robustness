It also includes the words \"I stand with the president,\" along with the group's name and logo.\n\n\"Whoever is chosen president by the people will be unable to carry the burden without our support. Whatever good he starts we should continue till the end. Time to curb hurtful words. Set free a humane heart.\"\n\nThis claim was emailed to Rappler by a reader for fact checking. It was also flagged by Facebook's fact checking tool Claim Check as potentially false or misleading.\n\nMichael V did not say he stands with President Duterte or that he supports Sara Duterte in the 2022 elections.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Thursday, July 30, Michael V addressed the graphic that has been circulating, saying that he wrote the poem 4 years ago \"to encourage people to accept and respect the election results, consistent with the 'Dapat Tama' campaign na ginawa ko with GMA Network.\"\n\nIn his July 30 post, Michael V clarified that his poem was not a recent post. \"I have no problem with people using it for the right reason pero HUWAG PO NATING GAMITING CAMPAIGN MATERIAL,\" he said. (I have no problem with people using it for the right reason but let's not use it as campaign material.)\n\nHe used the hashtag \"#fakenews\" and also included a screenshot of the graphic being circulated. He encircled the words \"I stand with the president,\" \"SARA DU30 Supporters 2022,\" and the Facebook page's logo in red. \u2013 Vernise Tantuco/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
