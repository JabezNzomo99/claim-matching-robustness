The values for 2015/2016 and 2016/17 were 39.1% and 37.8%, Eric Njaggah, the director of technical services at the water regulatory board, told Africa Check.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for the high water losses, Njaggah said. These include old infrastructure, pipe leakages and bursts, theft and illegal connections. Meter under-registration - when a meter bills less than the water flowing through it - is also a challenge.\n\nin Mathare slum that allows residents to get water using a reloadable smart card for as low as KSh0.50 per 20 litres.\n\nHowever, most people in Nairobi\u2019s slums buy water from vendors who are close to where they live, community activists say.\n\nRachel Mwikali, an activist and resident of Mathare slum, told Africa Check that water is sourced from nearby Nairobi Water connections.\n\nWhile there are some legal water points, Boniface Muthee, who chairs the\n\n, says much of the water sold in the slums is acquired illegally.\n\n\u201cThese are people doing business outside the purview of Nairobi Water.
