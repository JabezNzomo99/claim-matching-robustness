It doesn\u2019t actually chart the specific locations in the U.S. where human trafficking incidents were documented as having taken place; rather, it was part of an exercise by one hospital\u2019s staff to try to identify the five states with the most cases of human trafficking:\n\nDuring Knox Community Hospital\u2019s inaugural Patient Safety Awareness Week activities held March 10-16, KCH staff combined their knowledge of U.S. states with an insidious topic \u2014 that is growing in cases each year \u2014 to gain more insight into the situation. Working with Christina White, RN, an Emergency Department nurse, and Levi Motter, RN, KCH patient safety officer, about 100 hospital employees were asked to stick five pins in different colors on a Human Trafficking Map. These would be the five states they believed had the most cases of human trafficking \u2014 including both sex tracking or labor trafficking, and sometimes a combination of the two.\n\nAccording to that article, the employees were fairly accurate overall in identifying the five states with the highest levels of trafficking activity:\n\nOverall, Motter said, KCH staff members did a good job in recognizing the five states with the most reported cases of human tracking: California, Texas, Florida, Ohio, and New York, in that exact order. Most got the five states right. But only two of 100 employees had the exact order right, he added. White and Motter both noted that many people would rightly guess the coastal, densely populated states of California, Florida and New York as being a beacon to criminal activity that involves human trafficking, and Texas as well. It\u2019s the largest state in the continental United States and shares a long border with Mexico. \u201cIts freeways, with easy access in and out of the state,\u201d White said. Motter agreed, adding, \u201cYou can get across Ohio in about two and-a-half to three hours.\u201d\n\nThis information corresponds with data presented by the Polaris Project\u2019s National Human Trafficking Hotline (NHTH) for 2018.\n\nThe Facebook post reproduced above does err in citing western Pennsylvania as the site of one of the \u201cbiggest concentrations in the country for abductions and trafficking.\u201d As noted above, the pins in the map only denote states as a whole (not regions within states), and according to the NHTH\u2019s data, in 2018 Pennsylvania ranked 11th in number of human trafficking cases among U.S. states.\n\nAlso, the Facebook post above references \u201cabductions and trafficking,\u201d but in fact most human trafficking does not involve the kidnapping of victims through physical force:", "lang": "en"}
