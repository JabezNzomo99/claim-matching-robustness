(The actual order does not single out Christians, but religious minorities in countries.) He said that \u201cif you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States.\u201d\n\nBut this is a case where figures can be misleading. Let\u2019s look at the numbers for Iraq, whose refugees register at the exact same offices in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and other countries maintained by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. UNHCR identifies refugees for possible admission to the United States, though the final approval and screening is done by the U.S. government.\n\nIn the case of Iraq, Christians represent 15 percent of the Iraqi refugees, even though they only make up less than 1 percent of the Iraqi population. (*Correction: an earlier version of this article undercounted the number of Iraqi and Syrian Christians because many were listed as \u201cCatholic\u201d or another Christian faith rather than \u201cChristian.\u201d Totals may reflect other religions.)\n\nThe simple fact is that the reason for the disparity is unclear, though there are a number of theories. Nina Shea, who heads the Center for Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute, says that Syrian Christians are \u201cmarginalized\u201d in U.N. programs, especially in refugee camps. She says that many Christians are afraid to settle in camps because the camps are dominated by Muslims.\n\nStill, UNHCR data indicates that relatively few of the Syrian refugees have identified themselves as Christian. In Syria, 1.5 percent of the 1 million refugees are Christian, in Jordan, 0.2 percent of the 655,000 refugees are Christian, in Iraq, 0.3 percent of the 228,000 refugees are Christian, and in Egypt, 0.1 percent of the 115,000 refugees are Christian. However, religion is not recorded in Turkey, where 2.7 million Syrian refugees have fled.\n\nChris Boian, a UNHCR spokesman, that the agency did not know why there was such a disparity between the Christian makeup of Iraqi and Syrian refugees arriving in the United States, except that the agency does not discriminate. \u201cWe believe part of it is that Syria is not Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cMany Syrian refugees may have the financial and social means to move without going through UNHCR.\u201d\n\nIn October 2015, Shea directly asked then-U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Ant\u00f3nio Guterres \u2014 now U.N. secretary general \u2014 during an appearance at the National Press Club about the dearth of Christian refugees from Syria. He responded by noting that the percentages were higher for Iraq, in part because he believed the experience for Christians was far worse in Iraq. He also noted that most of the Syria Christians had fled to Lebanon because of the long-standing links between the two countries.\n\nGuterres said that Lebanon\u2019s then-Christian president had even told him: \u201cDon\u2019t resettle Christians. They are vital to us.\u201d Guterres went on to say that the Middle East \u201cis where Christianity was born, and to see these communities at the risk of being eradicated from that area is something I consider with horror. \u2026 [To remove Christians from] that part of the world that would be to really do an amputation in the DNA of Christianity and in the DNA of the Middle East.\u201d\n\nHe said many Syrian Christians have fled to regime-held areas, such as Damascus and the Valley of the Christians, hunkering down to remain near their properties and businesses; he said they generally support the Syrian regime. Most Christians who have left Syria have not registered with U.N, agencies, which is a necessary step to be considered a refugee. By contrast, he said, \u201cmore Iraqis have registered once they travel to Jordan so as to join families in the West.\u201d\n\nTrump goes too far to claim that it is \u201cvery tough\u201d for Syrian Christians to become refugees in the United States, and that they have been \u201chorribly treated.\u201d While it is correct that a relatively small percentage of Syrian refugees have been admitted, the Iraqi experience is exactly the opposite, even though the same U.N. agency is handling the refugee requests. The basic fact is no one fully understands why there is such a disparity, though it appears connected to the roots the Syrians have with Lebanon. The president could highlight that situation without suggesting that something nefarious is going on.", "lang": "en"}
