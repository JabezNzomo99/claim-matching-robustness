The administration has used that ambiguity to confuse matters even more, often arguing about semantics.\n\nThe amazing video above by The Washington Post\u2019s video team sheds significant light on the timeline, including the use of chemical agents to disperse the crowd.\n\nInitially, the National Park Service\u2019s statement said \u201ctear gas\u201d was not used on protesters, just pepper balls, a projectile munition that lofts irritant powder into the air. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says \u201ctear gas\u201d is an umbrella term for a riot-control agent \u2014 \u201cchemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.\u201d Pepper spray was listed as a type of riot-control agent.\n\nBRENNAN: There were chemical irritants, the Park Police has said \u2014 BARR: No, there were not chemical irritants. Pepper spray is not a chemical irritant. It\u2019s not chemical. BRENNAN: Pepper spray, you\u2019re saying is what was used \u2014\n\nBut this is simply wrong. PepperBall\u2019s website declares: \u201cWith multiple payload options and a proprietary chemical irritant that\u2019s proven more effective from even greater distances, PepperBall\u00ae projectiles offer the protection and versatility for any situation.\u201d (The company did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nWhat\u2019s that ingredient? It\u2019s called pelargonic acid vanillylamide, or PAVA, a \u201csynthetic'' form of capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot peppers. Anyone who\u2019s tried to insert contacts in their eyes after cutting hot peppers knows what that feels like. PAVA is mostly derived from synthesis rather than extraction from natural plant sources, according to the \u201cHandbook of Toxicology of Chemical Warfare Agents.\u201d\n\nThe Park Police confirmed to our colleagues at PolitiFact that officers used products of the PepperBall company. A Park Police spokesman would not respond to a query about what products were used on June 1, but every product on the website \u2014 except for harmless ones used in training \u2014 contain some level of PAVA.\n\nIf Barr had bothered to check with his own department, he would have quickly learned that PepperBalls are a chemical irritant. A 2009 Justice Department report noted that the PepperBall system \u201cfires projectiles containing highly irritating pepper powder,\u201d saying the \u201csystem\u2019s accuracy and accompanying blunt trauma impact made it an ideal chemical dispensing system.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Barr really thinks \u201cpepper balls\u201d are just made from pepper. But it\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019s so poorly informed about facts. A simple Google search would have found that a key ingredient in pepper balls is in fact a chemical irritant. So he appears to playing a game of semantics to confuse listeners.", "lang": "en"}
