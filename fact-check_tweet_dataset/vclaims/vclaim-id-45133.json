The shirts appear to be in a Comic Sans font, and those wearing them are holding up a sign supporting the New York Police Department, prompting Snopes readers to ask us if they were members of the NYPD.\n\nThe shirts would appear to be both a dark and flippant play on words stemming from one of the last statements uttered by Floyd before he died on May 25, which was \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nBut the image actually shows protesters from a demonstration in December 2014, months after the death of Eric Garner, a black man, at the hands of an NYPD officer, and more than five years before the death of George Floyd.\n\nIn July 2014, Garner died as a result of police officer Daniel Pantaleo placing him in a chokehold. His dying words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d became a rallying cry for protesters calling for an end to police killings of black people. In early December 2014, a grand jury found \u201cno reasonable cause\u201d to bring charges against Pantaleo, triggering protests. In July 2019, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered that the case against Pantaleo be dropped, and a month later, Pantaleo was fired from the NYPD.\n\nAccording to one report from the 2014 demonstration, about 100 people gathered outside New York\u2019s City Hall in support of the NYPD on Dec. 19, while other reports said the number was closer to 50. The pro-NYPD gathering, organized by a group called Thank You NYPD, faced off against around 200 counter-protestors demonstrating against police brutality. Organizers from Thank You NYPD told The Village Voice that their group was not made up of police officers, but \u201ccitizens who appreciate the safety that the NYPD provides our great city. Ten million people policed by 35,000 officers is one hell of a task to handle.\u201d\n\nAt the demonstration, the pro-NYPD protesters chanted \u201cDon\u2019t resist arrest\u201d when the anti-police brutality demonstrators chanted \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nA video from the protest, by ReasonTV, sets the scene:\n\nA 2014 report from Gawker included some of the shirt-wearer\u2019s perspectives. An attendee named Mike Stables had flown in from Colorado for the protest, bringing \u201cI Can Breathe\u201d T-shirts with him.\n\nWhile it is not clear whether many NYPD cops were part of the protests or wearing the shirts, a number of people close to the police were present. Some attendees included a retired NYPD detective and a mother of an NYPD officer. According to CBS, neither Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, nor police unions, endorsed the rally because of concerns about violence. Bratton expected a low turnout. Patrick Lynch, a police union leader, complained about the lack of support from New York City\u2019s mayor and his administration:\n\nIn the above video, a pro-NYPD protester at City Hall responded to a journalist\u2019s comment on how the police use force to defend themselves: \u201cThey do it with force \u2014 well, no, we\u2019re not allowed to use force.\u201d\n\nSteven W. Thrasher, a columnist and faculty member at Northwestern University\u2019s Medill School of Journalism, reflected on his coverage of the December 2014 protest for Contexts. By his account, off-duty cops were indeed present:\n\nAnother report from Gothamist relates an exchange between protesters, indicating more off-duty cops were present:\n\nIt is clear from multiple reports that off-duty cops were indeed present at the pro-police side of the rally, but we are still unable to determine if any of them were wearing the shirts saying \u201cI Can Breathe.\u201d We do know that these images are from a 2014 rally supporting the NYPD after the death of Garner, and not in response to the death of Floyd. We thus rate this image as \u201cMiscaptioned.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
