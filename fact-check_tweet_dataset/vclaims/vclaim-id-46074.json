On April 7, 2020, news agency ANI tweeted quoting the DCP of Gautam Budh Nagar that those in Sector 5, Harola, Noida who came in contact with Tablighi Jamaat members have been quarantined.\n\nANI\u2019s news was amplified by Smita Prakash, Editor of ANIand Amish Devgan, Managing Editor of News18 Hindi.\n\nANI\u2019s news regarding the link with Tablighi Jamaat was however refuted by DCP Noida\u2019s official twitter handle saying that people who had come in contact with the positive case were quarantined as per the laid procedure. \u201cThere was no mention of Tabligh Jamat. You are misquoting and spreading fake news,\u201d wrote the DCP. ANI subsequently deleted the tweet without any explanation.\n\nEven though DCP\u2019s office reacted immediately to the misinformation and ANI\u2019s tweet was deleted, it found a mention in Times of India\u2019s Delhi lockdown news update.\n\nThe erroneous tweet also found its way in a Jagran report.\n\nANI has subsequently issued a correction taking out the reference to Tablighi Jamaat.\n\nThe news agency has been featured in several Alt News reports for publishing misleading news. In a report from February 6, 2020, Alt News found that ANI\u2019s coverage of citizenship law protests held abroad was skewed \u2013 reporting on pro-CAA rallies but missing out on anti-CAA protests. Last year, we published a compilation of the \u2018inadvertent errors\u2019 made by the news agency corrected mostly without clarifications.", "lang": "en"}
