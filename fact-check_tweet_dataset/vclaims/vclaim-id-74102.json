This is not true.\n\nAccording to the latest official Test and Trace data for England published the same day, \u201c71.8% of test results were received within 24 hours of the test being taken\u201d at regional test sites, and 60.6% at mobile testing units. This covers tests taken in the week ending 24 June.\n\nWe asked DHSC about this on Thursday and have not yet received an answer, but on Saturday Mr Hancock added a reply to correct his original tweet. The reply included a link to the official data, and said: \u201cTo be clear on this - this refers to the proportion of test results that are returned the very next day.\u201d\n\nThis is a different measurement, which includes some test results delivered after more than 24 hours\u00ad\u00ad\u2014for instance if somebody takes a test on Monday morning, then receives the result on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe government does not publish detailed data on this measurement, but it is mentioned in the latest Test and Trace bulletin, which says about regional test sites: \u201cIf we consider the day the test was taken, this means that 98.0% of tests results were received the next day after the test was taken.\u201d For mobile testing units, it gives a figure of 96.7%.\n\nThe government committed itself to a target of all non-postal tests turned around within 24 hours by the end of June. When we asked what was meant by \u201cturning around\u201d, a government spokesperson told us: \u201cTesting times are defined as time taken to process a result from when the sample is provided. That\u2019s what the 24 hour target will focus on.\u201d\n\nWe will write about whether this target has been met once the data for the end of June has been published, on Thursday 9 July.", "lang": "en"}
