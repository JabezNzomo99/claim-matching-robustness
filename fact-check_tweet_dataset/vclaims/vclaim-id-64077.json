But these claims are misleading; authorities in both countries issued statements against the prescription of hydroxychloroquine on safety grounds months ago.\n\n\u201cDr Stella Immanuel vindicated as France approves drug for Covid 19 treatment,\u201d reads the first line of one of the posts, which goes on to list four claims about hydroxychloroquine. The text was shared on Facebook, including here on August 3, 2020, and here just more than a week later. The same text was also shared in an article on a Nigerian-based news site called Henotace.\n\nThe post introduces Immanuel, who claimed to have successfully treated more than 350 COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine in the US, as the \u201cCameroonian-American physician, author, and pastor\u201d who \u201ccame under severe attack by tech giants ... for revealing to the world covid 19 has a cure\u201d.\n\nAFP Fact Check debunked Immanuel\u2019s claims on July 29, 2020, two days after her public announcement.\n\nFour other claims are made in the post. AFP Fact Check looks at each one.\n\nThe full claim reads as follows: \u201cFrance approves the use of HCQ for treatment of Covid 19. After trials proved successful. 800 hospital have commenced using it.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading. France revoked approval for the prescription of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, as a COVID-19 treatment in May following reports of side-effects in patients, as reported here by AFP.\n\nJust days after Immanuel\u2019s video went viral, a similar claim that she had been vindicated by French approval of hydroxychloroquine was shared on Facebook in South Africa here and here.\n\nAgain, this was misleading -- France had banned the prescription of hydroxychloroquine the month before Immanuel\u2019s address. These posts also linked to a TV report on France\u2019s use of hydroxychloroquine as a pandemic treatment, but AFP Fact Check found that the broadcast clip by One America News Network (OANN) predated the European nation\u2019s change of heart on the drug\u2019s safety and efficacy.\n\nThe claim that New York doctor Vladimir Zelenko successfully treated 699 COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine appears to originate from a YouTube video he posted on March 24, 2020, about the alleged efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cDr. Zelenko from New York treated 699 covid19 patients with HCQ, with 100% success rate. Treatment takes only 5 days -average recovery rate is 2weeks, but HCQ does it in 5 days,\u201d reads the claim in full.\n\nThe Zelenko footage emerged a day after he published an open letter asserting the same to US President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Zelenko did not provide any evidence to support his claims, and reportedly sparked the interest of federal investigators after an email gaffe by a conservative commentator in which he claimed the doctor had \u201can FDA approved randomized test of HCQ underway\u201d -- which was not true.\n\nTo date, there is no known cure for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of research ongoing with regards to finding an effective treatment for COVID-19, but we still do not have any cure for the disease,\u201d said Dr. Mary Stephen, technical officer for the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn March, we launched a solidarity trial with four lines of treatment. But the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) arm of the solidarity trial was stopped on June 17, 2020, following cases of cardiovascular side effects in patients.\u201d\n\nThe National Institutes of Health and the US Food and Drug Administration have also stopped their clinical trials on the anti-malaria drug.\n\nLast month, AFP reported on a Brazilian study that found hydroxychloroquine ineffective against COVID-19.\n\nThe Facebook post also claims that South Korea started using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients in February 2020.\n\nThis is false. South Korea has never approved hydroxychloroquine nor its sister drug chloroquine for coronavirus treatment and halted trials after concerns about associated risks.\n\nSouth Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the country has, instead, recommended the use of remdesivir against the viral disease.\n\n\u201cThe Central Clinical Commission, a government-organized task force of doctors and other medical experts, officially advised the use of remdesivir, an Ebola drug developed by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences Inc., for coronavirus treatment,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cBut the commission decided not to recommend the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, medications used to prevent and treat malaria, while advising that the use of kaletra, a medication for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), should be cautiously decided.\u201d\n\nNew York started trial use of hydroxychloroquine?\n\nThe claim that New York state has started the trial use of hydroxychloroquine is misleading. Clinical trials of the anti-malaria drug in New York were completed without major findings, as reported here and here.\n\nThe final claim reads: \u201cResearch for Oklahoma says its effective, New York have started trial use (sic).\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check also found that the claim about \u201cresearch\u201d in Oklahoma concluding hydroxychloroquine is effective against coronavirus originated from this news report published back in March by Oklahoma\u2019s largest daily newspaper The Oklahoman.\n\nThe report merely quotes Joan Merrill of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation saying that the drug could be effective for the prevention and treatment of the coronavirus based on early results from China and France regarding its potency.\n\n\u201cBut these are not scientific studies yet,\u201d the report quoted Merrill as saying.", "lang": "en"}
