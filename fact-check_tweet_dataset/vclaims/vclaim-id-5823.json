The quote does not exist outside of the social media posts and blogs.\n\nExamples can be seen here , here and here .\n\nThe posts often read: \u201cKurt Russell wrote: \u201cYes... let\u2019s all join in the hatred of all police for the sins of a few. Let\u2019s defund one of the most important public institutions in our countries history. Let\u2019s have all badges removed and allow people to tend to their own safety and security. But before you do so, let me tell you about the badge and the thousands of good men and women it represents.\u201d\n\nThe quote then goes on to list about 18 different heroic acts by police such as, \u201cThis badge ran towards certain death as the Towers collapsed on 9-11\u201d and \u201cThis badge ran into the line of fire to save the people in the Pulse Night Club.\u201d\n\nWhile the beginning of the quote links it to Kurt Russell, the end attributes it to \u201cUnknown\u201d.\n\nReuters could not find any evidence of a quote or social media post by Russell similar to the claim. A Google search of the quote brings up social media posts and blogs, but no credible sources linking it to Russell.\n\nAdditionally, Russell is not active on social media. On the \u201cThis Morning\u201d show, around the 1:35 mark, he said: \u201cI live in a different age now from when I grew up. I have nothing to do with social media. I don\u2019t know why anybody would want to Twitter out their anything I\u2019m thinking, you know. I don\u2019t know why, that\u2019s a part of the world I don\u2019t get. I don\u2019t do a computer, I\u2019ve got an iPad, I can do that.\u201d ( here )\n\nReuters found one interview where Russell talked about Law Enforcement in a Q&A about the 2002 film Dark Blue, but the police quote does not show up ( here ).\n\nKurt Russell\u2019s representative did not respond to Reuters request for comment as of this Check\u2019s publication.\n\nFalse. There is no evidence to show actor Kurt Russell ever said this quote about defunding police.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
