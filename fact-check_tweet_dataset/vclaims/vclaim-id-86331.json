Last year, the Fact Checker unveiled our guide to manipulated video, which includes three broad categories: Some video is taken out of context; other content is deceptively edited; or, in the worst instances, deliberately altered.\n\nThe Trump tweet is an example of \u201cMissing Context\u201d: The video is unaltered, but the way it is presented to the viewer lacks or misstates the context in which events occurred. In this specific case, this is an example of what we labeled as \u201cisolation\u201d \u2014 a brief clip from a longer video to create a false narrative that does not reflect the event as it occurred.\n\nFor instance, Republicans in 2018 cried foul when Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) shared on Twitter a clip of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings, claiming he uttered a \u201cdog whistle for going after birth control.\u201d The video snippet from his testimony did not make clear that Kavanaugh was quoting from the plaintiffs\u2019 position in a contraceptive case, rather than offering his own opinion.\n\nIn other words, Biden was calling for Democratic Party unity, not the reelection of Trump. But the video \u2014 eagerly shared by supporters of both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 does not let viewers know that. Instead, it appears to be part of an ongoing effort to suggest that Biden, who stutters, is too old or feebleminded to assume the presidency.\n\nIt turns out this is from a 1985 hearing for the nomination of William Reynolds to be associate attorney general, the No. 3 position at the Justice Department. Reynolds had been the assistant attorney general for civil rights, but his nomination foundered after he apologized for giving inaccurate or possibly misleading testimony about his civil rights record. Nevertheless, he went on to serve as a top aide to Attorney General Edwin Meese III.\n\nHere\u2019s what is going on. Biden, the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, had crafted a strategy that derailed Reynolds\u2019s nomination. He repeatedly focused on a Louisiana redistricting case \u2014 which President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s civil rights chief had called \u201ca blatant racial gerrymander.\u201d White officials in the state had excluded blacks from their meetings to draw up a plan that prevented a majority-black congressional district in New Orleans. Reynolds refused to challenge the plan, which was later overturned by the courts.\n\nBiden during the hearing read from a confidential memo written by Reynolds\u2019s staff. The memo said that white legislators allegedly used the \u201cn-word\u201d when they crafted the redistricting plan that did not allow for a majority-black district. Biden\u2019s tactic succeeded \u2014 enough Republicans joined Democrats to block the nomination.\n\nBut the word Biden used was \u201cNegro.\u201d The word may seem archaic or obsolete now, but is it really so offensive that it needs to be bleeped out? Some organizations, such as the United Negro College Fund and the National Council of Negro Women, still use it as part of their names.\n\nNegro was commonly used in the 1960s by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other early civil rights era leaders. But the mid-1960s brought the rise of \u201cblack\u201d as a replacement term, and by 1973, \u201cblack\u201d had most likely become more common than Negro. (\u201cAfrican American\u201d came into vogue in the 1980s.)\n\nThe audio of the speech shows that Biden was responding to a questioner who used the word Negro: \u201cFor some time I have had the feeling that the Southern senators are warmer now to the problems of the Negro in America. \u2026 Do you feel that way about it?\u201d\n\nBiden, in his response, used both Negro and black, indicating the transition in phrasing that was underway at the time: \u201cI think the two-party system is good for the South, and good for the Negro, good for the black in the South.\u201d\n\nWe sought an explanation from Fox News for the bleep but did not get a response. This video falls into another category of manipulated video that is missing context -- \u201cmisrepresentation.\u201d That\u2019s when unaltered video is presented in an inaccurate manner. Hannity told viewers the word that was bleeped out was \u201chorrible, degrading,\u201d when it is not.", "lang": "en"}
