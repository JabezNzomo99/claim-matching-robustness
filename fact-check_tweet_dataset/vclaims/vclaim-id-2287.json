Both have a point\u2014the Conservatives\u2019 latest proposals on executive pay have watered-down those they\u2019ve made in the past but they did strengthen shareholders\u2019 powers in 2013 as part of the Coalition government (and the responsible minister was actually Liberal Democrat).\n\nHow are they talking about different things? Because there\u2019s a difference between a \u201cpay policy\u201d and the actual pay that\u2019s set out for directors of a company each year. Theresa May is talking about the rules on setting the policy on directors\u2019 pay for future years, while Jeremy Corbyn is focusing on the amount a director gets in a given year.\n\nBetween the Companies Act 2006 and up until 2013, listed companies were required to publish an annual Directors Remuneration Report setting out, among other things, the company\u2019s policy on pay for its directors. Shareholders were able to vote on these reports\u2014but not the actual pay awards to individuals\u2014at Annual General Meetings, but those votes weren\u2019t binding on the companies.\n\nIt\u2019s worth saying that even if a vote is legally non-binding, it can still influence the company. Research has shown that in some\u2014but not all\u2014cases since 2003, companies did react when their remuneration report was voted down by shareholders.\n\nIn 2013, the Coalition government introduced reforms to make the votes on the setting of future pay policies binding, but kept the actual setting of directors\u2019 pay as an advisory vote.\n\nIn the last year Theresa May and the Conservatives have pledged to strengthen this further still, and make setting the pay packages a binding vote by shareholders.\n\nWhen she launched her campaign to be Conservative leader in 2016 Theresa May said: \u201cI want to make shareholder votes on corporate pay not just advisory but binding.\u201d\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 2017 manifesto followed that up by pledging: \u201cThe next Conservative government will legislate to make executive pay packages subject to strict annual votes by shareholders\u201d.\n\nThe latest reforms\u2014announced just last week\u2014amount to a watering-down of this particular pledge. Instead of introducing more binding votes on pay packages, the new requirements will focus instead on greater transparency. Companies with significant shareholder opposition to executive pay packets will be forced to have their names published on a register.\n\nA government official said: \u201cOur response will introduce reforms to make our largest companies more transparent and more accountable to their staff and shareholders and restore the balance between a company\u2019s performance and executive pay\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
