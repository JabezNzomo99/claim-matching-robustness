In May, the government made installation mandatory at risk of up to three years in prison and a $55,000 fine.\n\nThe app allows the Qatari authorities to keep track of coronavirus infections using GPS and Bluetooth technologies. It also provides people with COVID-19 safety information and situational updates.\n\nEHTERAZ requires users to register with their national personal identification number and has more than 1 million downloads on Google Play alone.\n\nThe developers describe the app as: \u201c[Y]our trusted smart application to follow up on the latest updates of COVID-19 Coronavirus in Qatar.\u201d\n\nThe claim is misleading, as are similar claims about apps in some other countries.\n\nIn a June 16 report, the Amnesty International Security Lab listed EHTERAZ among the contract-tracing apps that are \u201cmost dangerous for privacy\u201d used by governments in the pandemic.\n\nAn earlier AI Security Lab study criticized the app for a \u201chuge security weakness\u201d and failure to protect personal data collected by the app and housed on a central computer server.\n\n\u201cAmnesty International\u2019s Security Lab was able to access sensitive information, including people\u2019s name, health status and the GPS coordinates of a user\u2019s designated confinement location, as the central server did not have security measures in place to protect this data,\u201d AI said in its May 26 report.\n\nAmnesty said the Qatari authorities quickly fixed the issue after it notified them concerning the problem. Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Interior described EHTERAZ\u2019 latest update on June 24 as \u201c[m]inor bug fixes and enhancement.\u201d But Amnesty said that still fell short.\n\nThe fixes did not eliminate the options that allow for possible mass surveillance, Amnesty said. \u201cThe app is capable of optionally activating live location tracking of all users or of specific individuals,\u201d the lab reported, while noting that the feature was turned off for now.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has said coronavirus tracing apps, whether designed by governments or private enterprises like Google and Apple, should meet five \u201cminimal\u201d safeguards: consent, limitations on use, minimal data collection, data destruction when finished, transparency about what\u2019s being collected and how the collected data is being stored and used, and termination once the pandemic passes.\n\nIn addition to the Amnesty investigations, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created a database of 25 COVID-19 contact tracing apps used by governments. MIT said its COVID Tracing Tracker is intended \u201cto capture details of every significant automated contact tracing effort around the world.\u201d\n\nMIT reported that nearly all coronavirus tracing apps in its database breach either one or all of the ACLU safeguard policies. The AI Security Lab identified dozens of governments that use COVID-19 tracing apps with \u201chighly invasive surveillance\u201d capabilities.\n\nChina uses technology to \u201ctighten\u201d the government\u2019s \u201cgrip on citizens,\u201d an AI report on Chinese tracing apps concluded.\n\nAmnesty faulted Bahrain and Norway for use of centralized tracking in their apps, saying the countries are running \u201croughshod over people\u2019s privacy, with highly invasive surveillance tools which go far beyond what is justified in efforts to tackle COVID-19.\u201d\n\nNorway paused its contract-tracing app, called Smittestopp, after consultations with Amnesty International. In mid-June, after the country\u2019s Data Protection Agency raised concerns that it was constantly uploading users\u2019 data without their consent, Norwegian health authorities deleted data and halted uploads. According to a report by Tech Crunch, the app had been downloaded 1.6 million times and was in use by 14 percent of Norwegians older than 16.\n\nIn a statement, Norway\u2019s health minister, Camilla Stoltenberg, defended the app: \u201cWith this, we weaken an important part of our preparedness for increased spread of infection, because we lose time in developing and testing the app. At the same time, we have a reduced ability to fight the spread of infection that is ongoing.\u201d\n\nAs for other countries:\n\u2022 Iran claims its popular coronavirus app Mask is a safe tool to protect people from being infected. The app, however, has been banned from Google Play for \u201ccollecting more data than its rules allowed.\u201d\n\u2022 Turkey requires citizens to download the Hayat Eve S\u0131\u011far app developed by its health ministry. The app does not inform users that the data they upload is being shared with the police.\n\u2022 Bahrain\u2019s government promises to safeguard personal data collected by its COVID-19 app, BeAware. There is no indication Bahrain has responded to Amnesty listing the app as among those \u201cmost invasive\u201d and \u201cdangerous for privacy.\u201d\n\nAmnesty said countries such as France, Iceland and United Arab Emirates let users choose whether or not to upload personal data and explain how their data will be stored and used.\n\nIT security firms report that COVID-19 related cyberattacks are \u201cglobal and increasing,\u201d with malicious cyber actors seeing the pandemic as an opportunity for mass hacking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant rises in COVID19-related ransomware specifically since February, with some reporting indicating as much as a 900 percent rise in ransomware targeting the financial sector in particular,\u201d AJ Nash, senior director of cyber intelligence strategy at the U.S. based private cyber security firm Anomali, told Polygraph.info.\n\nA recent report by Anomali identified 12 fake Android contact-tracing apps \u2013 identical to the government-required apps but equipped with malware that steals personal data.", "lang": "en"}
