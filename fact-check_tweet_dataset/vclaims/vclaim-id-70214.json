The women are wearing sun hats and shoes, and two have megaphones slung over their shoulders. But they\u2019re not blockwalking\u2014they\u2019re facing what appear to be police and riot officers, who are standing on the other side of some makeshift fencing.\n\n\"Democrats campaigning!\" the Nov. 3 posts says. The next line is followed by an emoji vomiting: \"Showing a brilliant statement to gain your vote.\"\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nA reverse Google image search quickly shows that the photo is more than a decade old. Photographer Juan Barreto took it for Agence France-Presse on May 16, 2005. The naked women were part of a protest over land rights, and Barreto captured them at the entrance of the presidential residence in Mexico City.\n\nIn Vermont, a group of women did recently take their clothes off in hopes of boosting voter participation there and elsewhere in the country. Ten women \"stripped, held ballots in strategic positions, and let a photographer snap their images in an attempt to convince people to vote on Tuesday,\" Minnesota Public Radio reported.\n\nOn Oct. 30, the group posted a mission statement to a Facebook page called Grab Them By The Ballot, named for the get-out-the-vote campaign. It touches on progressive causes and concerns, but doesn\u2019t mention Democrats.\n\n\"With the #MeToo and #Wetoo movements and recent confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh there is much at stake in the upcoming elections,\" the mission statement says. \"This group of courageous Vermont women came together in a vulnerable artistic expression to protect al women\u2019s right to choose regarding their body, health, reproductive rights and sexual expression. We joined hands as an outcry against the collective sexual and emotional abuse and trauma endemic in our society. And to champion the rights of marginalized women including transgender people, women of color and physically \u2018disabled\u2019 women.\"\n\nPublications including Fox News, the Daily Mail, and The Sun reported that the group was seeking votes for Democrats.\n\nWhile there is a campaign featuring nude women supporting historically liberal causes, the Facebook claimed that the three women in the photograph were Democrats campaigning. They were activists protesting in Mexico City, and it wasn\u2019t a get-out-the-vote campaign.", "lang": "en"}
