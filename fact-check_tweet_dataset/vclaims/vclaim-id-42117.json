The claim is false; the same claim and list has circulated online since at least 2017; Muis told AFP it had not stripped the establishments of their halal status and said it had filed a police complaint about the misinformation; multiple restaurants on the list told AFP they were still halal certified.\n\nThe claim was posted on Facebook here on November 15, 2019.\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s caption says in part: \u201cMUIS has cancelled their halal-certified list. Check out the long list below.\u201d\n\nThe post then contains a lengthy list of 63 restaurants including their address.\n\nMuis is an acronym for the body\u2019s official name, Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same claim was also posted on Facebook here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; Muis has denied cancelling the restaurants\u2019 halal certification.\n\n\"A text claiming that Muis has cancelled the halal certification of 63 eating establishments is making its rounds on WhatsApp again. Once again, we will like to clarify that this claim is absolutely false,\u201d Muis wrote on Facebook on November 15.\n\nUnder Singapore law, Muis is the only organisation vested with the legal authority to issue Halal certifications, which attest that the food served is in accordance with Islamic principles.\n\nThe same claim and list of restaurants has circulated online since at least 2017, for example here.\n\nMuis told AFP that it had filed a police report on the issue in 2017. \u201cMuis filed a police report in 2017, when the list first surfaced online, and even before it went viral in 2018. We had not filed any police report since then.\u201d\n\nAFP found that the list of restaurants in the misleading Facebook post contains some eateries that are Halal certified and some that are not.\n\nFor example, Hanis, New Hawa, and Makan Bagus Nasi Padang are not certified halal according to Muis\u2019 official website.\n\nThe status of a restaurant's Halal certification can be checked on Muis\u2019 official website here.\n\nA search on Muis\u2019 website reveal that other restaurants on the misleading post\u2019s list, for example Siam Kitchen, were still certified halal.\n\nSiam Kitchen told AFP on December 6, 2019 that: \u201cAll Siam Kitchen outlets managed by Creative Eateries, past and present, are Halal certified by MUIS.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the halal certification status of the restaurant on Muis\u2019 website:\n\nAnother restaurant on the list, Seoul Garden HotPot, was also still listed as halal certified on the Muis website.\n\nSeoul Garden Group told AFP on December 11, 2019 that: \u201call outlets under Seoul Garden Group in Singapore are Halal-certified.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Muis listing:", "lang": "en"}
