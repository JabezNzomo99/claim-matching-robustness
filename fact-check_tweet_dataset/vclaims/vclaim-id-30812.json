According to the report, the viral video surfaced online on the night before elections in Mahasamund, Chhattisgarh. According to the report, Kausalya Devi Bansal, a BJP candidate from ward 19, and her relative were allegedly bribing voters. The report also added Bansal\u2019s statement that the video is fake. Alt News found Bansal\u2019s Facebook profile where she had posted an image in 2014 which states that she contested from Mahasamund, Ward 19 for BJP. Alt News compared a screenshot from the viral video with the Facebook cover image of Bansal in order to corroborate her identity. As evident, she is the woman in the white saree in the viral video. Alt News could not independently verify the allegations against Bansal however, the clip is unrelated to upcoming Delhi polls.", "lang": "en"}
