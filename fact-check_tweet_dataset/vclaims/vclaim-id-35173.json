There are two problems with this.\n\nFirstly, neither newspaper explained that the RCN recommended using \u201cwoman\u201d or \u201cwomen\u201d instead of \u201clady\u201d and \u201cladies\u201d.\n\nWhile the RCN did recommend using gender-neutral language in its style guide, it did not recommend this approach when describing women, as could be inferred from the reporting.\n\nAnd secondly, the RCN style guide is not a guide to nursing staff on how to speak to patients. It\u2019s an internal style guide for the RCN\u2019s own communications.\n\nThe RCN told us: \u201cThis was not guidance for nurses on how to speak to, or about, their patients. Instead it was a guide for staff who work at the RCN on respectful use of language.\n\n\u201cNurses are capable of making their own judgements about how they speak to the people they care for.\u201d\n\nSo suggesting that the terms have been \u201cbanned for use in hospitals\u201d, as the Mirror did, or that this is guidance that applies to nurses talking to patients (as both the Mail and the Sun did) is inaccurate.", "lang": "en"}
