Throughout the speech, Trump reiterates his administration is taking the threat of the coronavirus seriously.\n\nPolitico appears to misconstrue the subject of the president\u2019s statement, claiming that Trump \u201ctried to cast the global outbreak of the coronavirus as a liberal conspiracy intended to undermine his first term.\u201d But an examination of the video and transcript show Trump actually described Democratic complaints about his handling of the virus threat as \u201ctheir new hoax.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have exposed the far left\u2019s corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let\u2019s see what happens in the coming months,\u201d Trump said during the rally. \u201cLet\u2019s watch. Let\u2019s just watch. Very dishonest people. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they\u2019re politicizing it.\u201d\n\nThe novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has spread from China to 53 other countries, sickening 85,403 people and killing 2,924 others as of Saturday, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nSome Democrats, including former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Vice President Joe Biden, have criticized the administration\u2019s response to the outbreak as rudderless and ill-prepared due to Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health budget cuts and leadership by Trump. But The Associated Press called this characterization \u201cdistorted\u201d since the agencies haven\u2019t seen loss of funding and have a \u201cplaybook to follow for pandemic preparation\u201d regardless of who\u2019s president.\n\nTrump described the so-called \u201cpoliticizing\u201d of the White House\u2019s response to the disease as what he perceives to be an attempt to undermine his administration, likening it to impeachment and the Mueller investigation.

They\u2019d been doing it since you got in. It\u2019s all turning. They lost. It\u2019s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.\u201d\n\nWhen looking at the entirety of Trump\u2019s remarks, it appears the \u201cnew hoax\u201d comment refers to the alleged Democratic \u201cpoliticizing\u201d of his response to the coronavirus threat \u2013 not the coronavirus itself. The Hill, the Daily Beast and Slate, among other outlets, reported that the \u201choax\u201d comment was talking about Democratic criticism.\n\nSlate said, \u201cTrump Slams Democrats Over Coronavirus Criticism: \u2018This Is Their New Hoax,'\u201d while the Daily Beast posted, \u201cTrump: Democrats\u2019 Coronavirus Criticism A \u2018New Hoax.'\u201d\n\nAt no point in the rally does Trump directly call the novel coronavirus outbreak a \u201choax\u201d or \u201cconspiracy.\u201d In fact, he refers to the respiratory virus as a \u201cpublic health threat\u201d and reiterates \u201cwe have to take it very, very seriously. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We are preparing for the worst.\u201d\n\nTrump denied that he called the coronavirus a \u201choax\u201d in a Feb. 29 press conference. He said he was \u201creferring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody because we\u2019ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them. I\u2019m not talking about what\u2019s happening here. I\u2019m talking what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the hoax,\u201d according to NBC News.\n\nThe president and Vice President Pence, who has been placed in charge of the administration\u2019s response to the outbreak, announced new travel restrictions involving Iran and increased travel advisories for Italy and South Korea at the press conference as well. The new measures come after Washington health officials announced the first death in the U.S. from the novel coronavirus.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
