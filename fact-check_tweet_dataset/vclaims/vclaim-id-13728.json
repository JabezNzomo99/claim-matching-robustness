The figure quoted in the graphic seems to be based on multiplying that number by five to get a cost for \u201cfive years\u201d.\n\nWe don\u2019t have an up to date figure on the actual cost, and we haven\u2019t found a reliable source for the 128 languages figure.\n\nThe claim is based on an almost decade-old stat\n\nThe information in the image seems to come from a Daily Express article from 2017.\n\nThat article seems to be based on a 2012 report from think tank 2020health, which used FOIs to ask NHS trusts how much they spent on translation services. It\u2019s unclear from the report whether these trusts were just in England and when we asked 2020health they weren\u2019t able to tell us.\n\n2020health asked the trusts how many languages they translated patient information into as well as how much they\u2019d spent on the translation of written information, translation services and employing translators in the three financial years from 2008/09.\n\n247 of the 299 trusts they asked responded, or just over 80%.\n\n95% of these trusts said they spent \u00a323.3 million on translation services in 2010/11. That was around 0.02% of that year\u2019s health spending in England.\n\nBecause not all of the trusts responded, we don\u2019t know what the total spend will actually have been for 2010/11.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure where the five year cost of \u00a3100 million quoted in the Express came from, but multiplying the \u00a323.3 million figure (for one year) by five gives around \u00a3115 million. We\u2019ve asked the article\u2019s author for more information.\n\nThese figures are almost a decade old, and not complete. The report also said there was some confusion from the trusts about what information 2020health actually wanted.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how many languages the NHS translates into\n\nIt\u2019s not clear where the Express got its figure of 128 languages from. The 2020health report said that some trusts said they translated \u201cas many as 120\u201d, but it\u2019s unclear whether this was the number of languages trusts translated information into or the number of requests they\u2019d had to translate things.\n\nThe report also says: \u201cMost of the Trusts that responded with figures [for written translations] translated between 5 and 25 languages\u201d. We\u2019ve asked NHS England whether they know how many languages are translated in total.\n\n2020health told us services for the deaf or blind had not been included in these costs, but they may include costs of \u2018translating\u2019 text into easy read English.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how much the NHS is now spending on translation services\n\nInformation on how much NHS England spends on translation services is not held centrally. Last year the Department of Health and Social Care, responded to a question from an MP on the subject of NHS translation services, saying: \u201cthere has been no central audit of translation services in the National Health Service, as these services are commissioned by individual NHS organisations.\u201d\n\n2020health told us they hadn\u2019t updated the data since their 2012 report was produced.", "lang": "en"}
