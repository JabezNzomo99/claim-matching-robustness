There are more than 17 million vacant homes across the U.S., according to the Census Bureau.\n\n\u201cNo Masters No Gods,\u201d an online clothing store that sells clothing and other merchandise with left-leaning messages, posted the image on Dec. 13.\n\n\u201cOver 633k homeless in US, over 13.9 million vacant homes, 22 homes available per person, capitalism must end,\u201d reads the caption. It cites the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) as the source of its figures.\n\nWhile it\u2019s accurate to say there are more vacant homes than homeless people in the U.S., the statistics cited in the image aren\u2019t correct. (RELATED: Is Homelessness Up Nearly 50 Percent In Los Angeles Since 2013?)\n\nTom Murphy, director of communications for NAEH, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that the figure for homelessness doesn\u2019t reflect the most recent data, saying, \u201cThe last time the numbers were in that range was 2010, when the count was 637,077. The most recent federal data is for 2018, when the count was at 552,830.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, approximately 65 percent of all homeless people, or 358,363 individuals, were sheltered in some capacity, while the remaining 194,467 homeless people were unsheltered, according to NAEH. (The number of homeless people has fluctuated in recent years but has generally trended downward over the past decade.)\n\nThe Census Bureau tracks the number of vacant homes in the U.S. on a quarterly basis and, as of October 2019, the number stands at about 17 million. That\u2019s roughly 3.1 million more than the meme suggests. The last time the number of vacant homes was 13.9 million was in 2001, according to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis.\n\nBased on currently available numbers, there are about 31 vacant housing units for every homeless person in the U.S. (RELATED: Did Ben Carson Call Homelessness \u2018A Gift From Heaven\u2019?)\n\nSome government programs have been instituted to utilize vacant properties to help house homeless people. For instance, the Title V program of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act \u201cenables eligible organizations to use unutilized, underutilized, excess, or surplus federal properties to assist persons experiencing homelessness,\u201d according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s website.\n\nMany of the vacant housing units on the market are homes that have been foreclosed and are now owned by banks, according to Business Insider.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
