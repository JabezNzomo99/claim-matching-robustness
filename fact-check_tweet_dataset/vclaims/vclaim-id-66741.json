The mayor, however, has parsed his words more carefully, saying the project will create \"hundreds\" of jobs and has the potential to enhance the area culturally and economically.\n\nWe contacted Brian Hooker, executive director of the McPherson Implementing Local Redevelopment Authority. He told us the often-touted employment figure was formulated based on data from Perry\u2019s organization.\n\nThe Army, he said, wanted to assess how the proposed studio would affect vehicle traffic around the post, which closed in 2011.\n\nThe job numbers, developed in July 2014, assume that between 10 and 20 productions will be in the works at the studio all times. Each production involves 200 to 300 skilled union and nonunion workers, as well as the talent (the on-screen folks and those you and I would consider the stars).\n\nJobs at the studio could range from a low of 3,900 to a high of 8,300, according to the calculations.\n\nThe vast majority -- 2,000 to 6,000 -- involve contract work related to the productions. A production usually takes an average of four to five months, Hooker said.\n\nThe second biggest pool of workers -- between 500 to 1,500 -- will be temporary jobs building the studio.\n\nThe actual number of full-time jobs is estimated at between 400 and 800, with the bulk of those -- 300 to 500 -- being members of the professional and executive staff overseeing daily operations at the studio, Hooker said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly how many of those executive staff employees will be true new hires. That\u2019s because the permanent employees of the current Tyler Perry Studios, about 350, are expected to move to McPherson. (Tyler Perry Studios executives have not shared their plans for the existing studio facilities, Hooker said.)\n\nBetween 100 to 300 workers, categorized as \"operations labor,\" also will be full time. They will be responsible for assisting set designers and others who come to the studio as part of the various productions, Hooker said.\n\nTyler Perry plans to develop a major television and film studio at the former site of Fort McPherson, providing a major boost to the community and to Georgia\u2019s growing film industry.\n\nThe project has been forecast to create about 8,000 jobs, including some in construction. That\u2019s based on a report, which we examined that shows a potential range of jobs from 3,900 to 8,300.\n\nAt best only about 800 of those are expected to be permanent jobs.\n\nMost of them are in contract work. That\u2019s important and missing context that doesn\u2019t diminish the project but shortchanges the reader.\n\nThe overall statement from the city is partially accurate, but misleading.", "lang": "en"}
