This figure includes those farmers who cultivate their own land or leased land and of agricultural labourers, according to NCRB classification.\n\nThis, even as overall farm suicides in India declined year-on-year, to 11,379 in 2016 from 12,602 suicides in 2015.\n\nKarnataka ranks second, having 2,079 farm suicides in 2016.\n\nThe NCRB's data on suicides and accidental deaths was released on November 9, 2019 and pertains to calendar year 2016. This comes a little after their flagship report, 'Crime in India', which was released on October 21 and pertains to calendar year 2017, was released by more than a year's delay.\n\nDaily wage earners have the largest share of those committing suicide, followed by housewives and self-employed persons.\n\nIndividuals engaged in agriculture form the fourth largest cohort of suicides in India.\n\nThe distressing numbers of farm suicides in Maharashtra\n\nIn Maharashtra, farm suicides occurred for almost 1 in 5 of all suicides (3,661 of the 17,195) in 2016. At 3,661 suicides, the state saw an average of 10 farm suicides a day in 2016. Maharashtra's 3,661 farm suicides is more than 32% of all farm suicides in India, at 11,379.\n\nOf 11,379 farm-related suicides in India, the NCRB has provided the following categories, along with a breakdown at the state/UT level:\n\u2022 Farmers cultivating their own land, having 5,271 suicides, of which 2,283 are in Maharashtra.\n\u2022 Farmers cultivating leased land, having 999 suicides in India, of which 267 are in Maharashtra\n\u2022 Agricultural labourers, having 5,109 suicides in India, of which 1,111 are in Maharashtra\n\nMaharashtra has the highest number of suicides for all agriculture-related categories of any state in India.\n\nWhat is the reason behind farm suicides?\n\nThe NCRB provides no reason for the reasons behind agriculture-related suicides in India. This is a surprising, since the reasons were provided in the NCRB's prior report pertaining to 2015.\n\nThe 2015 report states that 'bankruptcy or indebtedness' and 'farming related issues' occurred for 38.7% and 19.5% of farmer and cultivator suicides in India respectively. This was followed by family problems and illness. The report further states that for agricultural labourers, family problems and illness accounted for the 40.1% and 19.1% of all suicides in 2015 respectively.\n\nInterestingly, similar breakdowns of the reasons behind suicides have been provided in the current report for overall suicides, but a agriculture-specific drill-down has not been provided.\n\nMaharashtra also leads overall suicide in India\n\nThe NCRB report also says all-inclusive numbers show Maharashtra had the single largest share of suicides in the country, with 17,195 of the 1,31,008 (or 13.1%). This is followed by Tamil Nadu, with 15,182 (or 11.6%) of all suicides.\n\nMaharashtra also has a suicides rate of 14.3%, above the national average of 10.3%, but trailing far behind Sikkim, with a suicide rate at 40.3%. The NCRB defines a suicide rate as the number of suicides per lakh of population.", "lang": "en"}
