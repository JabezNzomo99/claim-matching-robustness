Do you agree?\u201d\n\nOf the 1,000 registered voters questioned, 50.3 percent of them answered \u201cyes\u201d; 46.8 percent said \u201cno\u201d; 2.7 percent were \u201cundecided\u201d; and 0.2 percent \u201crefused\u201d to answer.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear which of Trump\u2019s claims respondents were agreeing or disagreeing with \u2014 that the Russia investigation is a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d or that there have been more politically motivated investigations of Trump than other presidents.\n\nThe survey question is \u201cflawed,\u201d Timothy Johnson, a past president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, told us in an interview.\n\nOther recent polls indicate that Americans have a more favorable opinion of Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Russian government and Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nA CNN poll published in February found that 58 percent of respondents said Russia\u2019s election interference is \u201ca serious matter that should be fully investigated,\u201d while 37 percent said the Mueller investigation is \u201cmainly an effort to discredit Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201d\n\nIn addition, a Washington Post/Schar School poll published last month found that 57 percent of adults thought \u201cMueller is mainly interested in (finding out the truth),\u201d while 36 percent said he is \u201cmainly interested in (hurting Trump politically).\u201d\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly referred to the nearly two-year-long investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d sent his tweet after the Suffolk University/USA Today poll results were released March 18.\n\nUSA Today published an article about the results that carried the headline \u201cPoll: Half of Americans say Trump is victim of a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 as trust in Mueller erodes.\u201d\n\nBut the responses were based on a problematic survey question, some experts say.\n\n\n\nAgain, the survey asked: \u201cPresident Trump has called the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 and said he\u2019s been subjected to more investigations than previous presidents because of politics. Do you agree?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first problem is that it\u2019s a double-barreled question,\u201d said Johnson, who is also the director of the Survey Research Laboratory and professor of public administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago. A double-barreled question is one that asks respondents to answer two questions at once.\n\nAre they being asked if they agree that the investigation is a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d or that Trump has been investigated more often because of politics, Johnson said. Those who responded with \u201cyes\u201d could have been answering either question or both.\n\nMonmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray made a similar point about the Suffolk University/USA Today survey question in a Twitter thread on March 18.\n\nAnother issue is that the question doesn\u2019t offer a counter to Trump\u2019s claim. \u201cIt only tells one side of the story,\u201dJohnson said.\n\n\n\nHe said it would be better to ask respondents if they agree that the investigation is a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d as Trump claimed, or if they agree that possible collusion is something that \u201cneeds to be investigated thoroughly,\u201d as others have claimed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always the goal to be balanced,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, only asking \u201cdo you agree\u201d can lead to acquiescence bias, which is when respondents are likely to agree regardless of the content of the question, Johnson explained.\n\n\u201cSome in our population will agree with any statement\u201d that is presented to them, he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the flaws mentioned,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cwe\u2019re not certain that this accurately reflects public opinion.\u201d\n\nResponding to the criticism, David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, told FactCheck.org in an email: \u201cThe statement links President Trump by name to his viewpoint on the investigation. If respondents were conflicted in any way, they opted for \u2018undecided\u2019 or \u2018refused.'\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Chrissy Terrell, director of communications and PR at Gannett, USA Today\u2018s parent company, emailed us a statement, saying: \u201cUSA TODAY and Suffolk University take seriously the framing of each question to ensure fairness and accuracy in response. We offer options that include \u2018undecided\u2019 or \u2018refused\u2019 for those who are unclear. Our reporting always specifies our methodology and with Suffolk University, we post the toplines and crosstabs to give transparency to the entirety of our polls.\u201d\n\nThe Suffolk University/USA Today survey is not the only one that has tried to measure how Americans view the Mueller investigation. Here are the questions and results from six other polls taken in the last five months. Some indicate there\u2019s less skepticism of the special counsel\u2019s probe.\n\nQ: Do you think Mueller is mainly interested in (finding out the truth), or that he\u2019s mainly interested in (hurting Trump politically)?\n\nQ: Thinking about the investigation into Russian efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016, which comes closer to your point of view about it?\n\nYou think it\u2019s a serious matter that should be fully investigated: 58 percent\n\nYou think it\u2019s mainly an effort to discredit Donald Trump\u2019s presidency: 37 percent\n\nQ: As you may know, there is an investigation into dealings between Trump associates and Russia. Do you think the investigation is justified, or is the investigation politically motivated?\n\nQ: Which comes closest to your view of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation into the 2016 election?\n\nIt is an unbiased investigation dealing with serious issues: 58 percent\n\nIt is biased political investigation designed to hurt President Trump: 42 percent\n\nQ: Which of the following statements comes closer to your opinion about Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible wrongdoing and Russian interference in the 2016 election?\n\nQ: Do you think that the investigation into any links or coordination between President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign and the Russian government is a legitimate investigation, or do you think it is a political witch hunt?", "lang": "en"}
