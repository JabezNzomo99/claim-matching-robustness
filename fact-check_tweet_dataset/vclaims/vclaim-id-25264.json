Several of our readers have asked us to check it.\n\nTo be eligible for asylum in the UK, you must be unable to live safely in your country out of fear of persecution because of characteristics like race, religion or political opinions that put you at risk there. Asylum seekers are those who are waiting for a decision on their asylum application. If asylum is granted, they get refugee status.\n\nKatie Hopkins makes claims about the financial support asylum seekers can apply for while they wait for a decision, and while most of these are broadly correct, one important thing is left out: only those who are destitute qualify for almost all of the financial support mentioned. Also, asylum seekers getting living support can\u2019t choose the type of accommodation they get.\n\nA potential asylum seeker who didn\u2019t make an application in France can make an application in the UK, no matter the legality of their route, or how safe France may or may not be for them. However, if there\u2019s evidence they\u2019ve passed through an EU country, they may be returned there under EU law.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at that claim here.\n\nAsylum seekers in the UK can apply for financial support, a place to live, or both, but only if they are \u201chomeless or don\u2019t have money to buy food\u201d. In almost all circumstances, asylum seekers cannot work while their application is being considered.\n\nThe government says decisions on straightforward claims are usually made \u201cwithin six months\u201d, but if it takes longer than 12 it is possible to apply for permission to work while the application is processed.\n\nThis is not correct. If an asylum seeker qualifies for asylum support, the government says the place they are given to live \u201ccould be in a flat, house, hostel or bed and breakfast\u201d. The government specifies that people \u201ccan\u2019t choose where\u201d they\u2019ll live, and accommodation is unlikely to be in London or south-east England.\n\nThat\u2019s the correct amount, but to qualify for this support, asylum seekers must be homeless or not able to afford food. \u00a337.75 per person in each household is loaded onto a debit card each week. They may also get extra money (between \u00a33 and \u00a35 per week) if they are expecting a baby or have a child under the age of three.\n\nAsylum seekers cannot work or claim other types of benefits while they\u2019re waiting for the decision on their application.\n\nIf someone is refused asylum, they may be eligible for somewhere to live, and \u00a335.39 per person on a payment card. They cannot take the payment card unless they take the offer of somewhere to live.\n\nThis is only for people whose asylum applications have been refused and their appeals rights are exhausted. Again, to be eligible, they must be homeless, not have money for food, and \u201ccan show that there\u2019s a reason why [they] can\u2019t leave the UK yet\u201d.\n\nFailed asylum seekers haven\u2019t necessarily made bogus applications, their circumstances may not have met the specific criteria the UK government has for making its decisions. Even if asylum is refused, the government may grant someone permission to stay for humanitarian or other reasons.\n\nAll asylum seekers and their dependents (and refused asylum seekers) in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are exempt from charges for GP treatment and consultations, whether or not they are receiving the asylum support described above.\n\nIn England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, asylum seekers are exempt from charges for hospital treatment. In England, where there are prescription charges, asylum seekers are usually exempt from these. For Great Britain, the government says asylum seekers may receive \u201chelp paying for glasses\u201d, rather than free glasses.\n\nThe rules are more complicated for refused asylum seekers.\n\nAll refused asylum seekers can receive free GP treatment, and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland they can get free secondary healthcare\u2014like hospital treatment\u2014too. In England, only failed asylum seekers who are receiving some type of asylum support can get free secondary healthcare.\n\nIn the UK, there are certain services like A&E treatment, family planning and treatment for infectious diseases that are free for anyone, regardless of immigration or asylum status.\n\nAsylum seekers on asylum support can apply for a one-off \u00a3300 maternity payment if their baby is due in less than eight weeks, or less than six weeks old. If someone has been refused asylum they can apply for a similar \u00a3250 payment.\n\nSeparate to asylum support, it\u2019s worth noting that UK residents in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (who are expecting their first child, or a multiple birth, and they or their partner are receiving certain benefits) can apply for the Sure Start Maternity Grant\u2014a one-off payment of \u00a3500. Similar payments of up to \u00a3600 are available in Scotland.\n\nIt is legal to apply for asylum in the UK, and this can only be done once someone arrives in the UK. This country is a signatory of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, so is supposed to grant asylum to those who are unable to live safely in their own country because of a well-founded fear of persecution there.\n\nThe video was posted at the same time as reports about people crossing the English Channel in small boats made headlines. Although getting to the UK in this way is not legal, potential asylum seekers can\u2019t be penalised for how they get into the country if it\u2019s to make a legitimate claim for asylum. The UN Refugee Convention says refugees can\u2019t be penalised for illegal entry or presence in a country \u201cprovided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence\u201d.\n\nThis is correct, around 46,700 were in receipt of either asylum support (the vast majority) or were failed asylum seekers receiving support because they were destitute. More recent figures for the end of September 2018 show around 47,500 were receiving support\u201443,400 were asylum seekers, and around 4,100 were failed asylum seekers.\n\nThe figure for asylum support is much lower than it used to be. At the end of 2003, over 80,000 people were receiving asylum support.", "lang": "en"}
