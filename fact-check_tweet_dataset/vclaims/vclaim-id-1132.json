The cards and flyers are \u201cfraudulent\u201d, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nPictures of the cards have been shared hundreds of times on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram (here , here , here , here , here).\n\nThe text on the \u201cFace Mask Exempt Card\u201d reads: \u201cI am exempt from any ordinance requiring face mask usage in public. Wearing a face mask poses a mental and/or physical risk to me. Under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose my condition to you.\n\n\u201cIf found in violation of the ADA you could face steep penalties. Organizations and businesses can be fined up to $75,000 for your first violation and $150,000 for any subsequent violations.\u201d\n\nSome U.S. states and major cities have introduced rules requiring face masks to be worn to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (here). However resistance to face masks has become partisan as President Donald Trump has not appeared in public wearing a face mask and has expressed disdain for those who do. (here)\n\nThe DOJ works to implement the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (here) . The department issued a statement entitled \u201cCOVID-19 ALERT: Fraudulent Facemask Flyers\u201d. It says: \u201cThese postings were not issued by the Department and are not endorsed by the Department. The Department urges the public not to rely on the information contained in these postings.\u201d (here)\n\nEarlier versions of the card contain a spelling error (\u201cposses\u201d instead of \u201cposes\u201d). Some cards have removed the Department of Justice\u2019s seal and corrected the spelling error, however they still misidentify the Americans with Disabilities Act as the \u201cAmericans with Disability Act\u201d. The website link on the card for the \u2018Freedom to Breathe Agency\u2019 is not accessible.\n\nPosts pointing out that these cards are fake have gone viral on social media with tens of thousands of retweets and shares (here , here).\n\nFalse. The \u201cFace Mask Exempt Cards\u201d being shared on social media are not endorsed by the United States Department of Justice, which describes them as fraudulent.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
