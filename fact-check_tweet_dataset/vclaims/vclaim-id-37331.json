He said:\n\nCiting the government\u2019s economic managers, he then said the inflation rate was 4.6 percent:\n\nTo Mercado\u2019s follow-up question, Panelo read from the economic managers group chat he earlier referred to, and said:\n\nPanelo confused the year-on-year inflation rate which indeed surged 6.4 percent in August, with the 4.8 percent year-to-date inflation rate.\n\nThe year-on-year rate compares August 2018 with August 2017 figures; the year-to-date from the start of the year to present, or January 2018 to August 2018.\n\nA joint statement by the country\u2019s economic managers themselves read:\n\nPanelo also refuted his own claim about previous administrations having higher inflation rates, when he told Mercado:\n\nThe matter of base years is a related but different issue altogether.\n\nThe Philippine Statistics Authority in February updated the base year for the Consumer Price Index, an indicator used in calculating inflation rates, from 2006 to 2012.\n\n\u201cRebasing is necessary when the basket of the reference year no longer represents what is commonly purchased by the households,\u201d the PSA said.\n\nPhilippine Statistics Authority, PSA Updates the Base Year for Consumer Price Index for All Income Households to 2012 from 2006, Feb. 22, 2018.\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
