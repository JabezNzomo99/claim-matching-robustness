Bruce Braley focuses on the minimum wage as part of his campaign\u2019s to paint Ernst as \"too extreme\" for Iowa.\n\nIt uses video and audio clips of Ernst speaking at primary debates and in interviews as evidence for the claim that she does not \"think there should be a national minimum wage.\"\n\nAccording to the most recent , Ernst and Braley are nearly tied. We wanted to know if this latest attack ad was accurate: Does Ernst oppose a national minimum wage?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first attack on Ernst for her position on the minimum wage. In a June , the Iowa Democratic Party accused Ernst of flip-flopping on the issue.\n\nWe decided to take a look back at Ernst\u2019s public statements and positions on the minimum wage, but it can get confusing. So we compiled a timeline to see if her views changed.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2014 Braley released a on minimum wage that suggested raising the national figure to $10.10 an hour. Ernst disagreed. \"I believe that businesses will do what is best for their business,\" she said in an interview the same day. \"I don\u2019t know that the government needs to be stepping in and telling them this is what you will do.\"\n\nErnst\u2019s to the federal government\u2019s role in raising a minimum wage continued. \"Government and government-mandated wage increases are not the solution,\" she said, as reported in a Quad-City Times story.\n\nAt a candidate held by the National Federation of Independent Business on March 18, 2014, Ernst said this: \"I do believe it is best left up to the states. Our state economies are much different from state to state, so I don\u2019t believe the federal government should be involved in setting the minimum wage.\" Ernst also talked about the great opportunity she had working a minimum wage job as a biscuit maker at Hardee\u2019s. \"I think $7.25 is appropriate for Iowa,\" she concluded.\n\nIn an April Ernst said she would not raise Iowa\u2019s minimum wage. She argued that minimum wage jobs were \"introductory level\" positions and eventually workers could progress into better paying jobs as they acquired more skills.\n\nErnst on Iowa Public Radio for a candidate profile on June 1, 2014. When asked about increasing the minimum wage, Ernst responded with a familiar line. \"I do not support a federal minimum wage. Every state has a different economy, different cost of living. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the role of the federal government,\" she said.\n\nBut she seemed to soften that position in late June. After Ernst won the Republican primary she suggested the minimum wage should be left as it is but not raised.\n\n\"I never called for the abolishment of it. Never,\" Ernst to U.S. News and World Report on June 23, 2014. \"I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t support a $10.10 minimum wage.\n\nThis is somewhat contradictory as her earlier comments suggested she saw no role for the federal government in setting the minimum wage.\n\nWhen we asked about it, Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel said Ernst believes that decisions about the minimum wage should be made \"locally, not in Washington.\" Ernst believes that \"Iowans know what\u2019s best for Iowa and that\u2019s where these decisions belong -- on the state level.\"\n\nPolitiFact asked the Ernst campaign on July 31, 2014, about Ernst's position on the minimum wage.\n\nPolitiFact: \"Does she believe that the federal government should play any role at all in deciding the minimum wage? Or should it be left up to the states entirely?\"\n\nErnst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel: \"While in college Joni worked for minimum wage at Hardee\u2019s and believes the minimum wage is a safety net. Joni does not believe in Washington\u2019s one size fits all approach; that\u2019s why any decision pertaining to the minimum wage rate going forward needs to be decided locally, not in Washington. What\u2019s right for New York or California, is not necessarily right for Iowa.\"\n\nPolitiFact: \"In a couple of debates and interviews she refers to the minimum wage as a 'safety net.' What exactly does she mean by that?\"\n\nHamel: \"The baseline minimum wage that has been set.\"\n\nBraley said that Ernst does not support a \"national minimum wage.\" Ernst's public statements have been confusing at times, but overall, she has said repeatedly that states should decide the minimum wage, not the federal government. She's also called the minimum wage a \"safety net,\" and her campaign told us that by that she means the current baseline minimum wage. Overall, we rate Braley's statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
