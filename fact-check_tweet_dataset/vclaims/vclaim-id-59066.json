Such grants were prohibited in 2014. Did Pres. Obama grant an exception?\"\n\nTo answer Giuliani\u2019s question, no exception was granted, because none was needed.\n\nThe policy that hit pause on certain research in 2014 didn\u2019t apply to the sort of work that was being done in Wuhan.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s wrong about what the policy was, and he\u2019s wrong about the dollars that went to the Wuhan lab.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, a cardboard box of vials labeled Variola was found in an ordinary cold storage room on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. The variola virus causes smallpox, and it had no place outside of a secure biological facility.\n\nIn August 2014, the Obama administration called for a nationwide stand-down and review for all labs working with potentially deadly biological agents. On Oct. 17, 2014, the White House announced it would not fund new projects that involved a certain kind of research called gain-of-function.\n\nLike the phrase suggests, gain-of-function research boosts the ability of a pathogen to cause disease. Why would anyone want to do that, outside of building a biological weapon? Well, this sort of work can help spot potential threats and give researchers time to craft ways to thwart a new virus.\n\nAdministration officials said that until they had new policies, this sort of work on viruses that cause influenza, MERS and SARS (two new diseases that had triggered pandemics) wouldn\u2019t get new money, and they asked labs with research underway to hit pause.\n\nBut the administration specifically let other research continue. The language is technical, but the key word is \"naturally.\"\n\n\"The funding pause will not apply to the characterization or testing of naturally occurring influenza, MERS, and SARS viruses unless there is a reasonable expectation that these tests would increase transmissibility or pathogenicity,\" the Oct. 17 policy said.\n\nThe policy and the Wuhan lab\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology was participating in a project led by the New York-based organization EcoHealth Alliance. That\u2019s a nonprofit that aims to protect the people, land and animals in areas where viruses can jump from one species to another, as coronaviruses are known to do.\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease backed work that focused on bats in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest from Wuhan, on the border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. Teams in the field gathered blood from bats and local residents. They sent the samples to Wuhan where the initial analysis took place.\n\nThe point is, any viruses found emerged in nature.\n\n\"The policy would not prohibit government agencies from funding any and all research at Wuhan Institute of Virology,\" said Gregory Koblentz, George Mason University associate professor of biodefense.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, Koblentz said, that some work done as part of the larger U.S. project might have involved gain-of-function experiments, but whether those would fall under the specific types of gain-of-function research covered by the restriction was doubtful.\n\n\"To the best of my understanding, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s claim is not consistent with reality,\" said John Holdren, one of the architects of the Obama administration\u2019s policy and a former assistant to the president for science and technology.\n\nThe work the lab did for the project did not involve gain-of-function research, but it is possible that other projects at the lab did.\n\nAdded Robert Kessler with the EcoHealth Alliance: \"We have not ever participated in gain-of-function research. Nor have we ever been funded to participate in gain-of-function research.\"\n\nGiuliani\u2019s claim has another flaw \u2014 timing. The moratorium policy took effect October 2014. The grant was approved at the end of May, five months earlier.\n\nWe reached out to Giuliani and did not hear back.\n\nGiuliani said the National Institutes of Health gave $3.7 million to the lab in Wuhan in 2017.\n\nThe correct amount is $598,500, according to the EcoHealth Alliance.\n\nThe NIH website shows that the total size of the grant was $3.4 million. About 15% of that went to the Wuhan lab. The grant was awarded in 2014, not 2017, as Giuliani said.\n\nGiuliani said that in 2017, the United States gave $3.7 million to the lab in Wuhan at a time when such a grant was prohibited.\n\nThe grant was made in 2014, and the amount that went to the lab was a bit under $600,000.\n\nThe grant restriction did not apply to identifying naturally occurring viruses, which is what the Wuhan lab did.", "lang": "en"}
