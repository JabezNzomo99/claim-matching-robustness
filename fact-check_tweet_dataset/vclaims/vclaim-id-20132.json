The claim is false; the footage is actually from a military simulation video game.\n\nThe posts, for example this one which was posted February 26, 2019 and has been viewed more than 13,000 times, contain black and white footage filmed through a target scope which shows people running from a building before it is hit by a rocket and explodes.\n\n\u201cIndian Air Force attacks Pakistan and kills about 250 terrorists. Historic! #SurgicalStrike Over 245 terrorist eliminated in IAF attack,\u201d the post's caption says.\n\nIndia\u2019s military has said that its jets carried out airstrikes in Balakot on February 26, 2019, hitting militants camps in retaliation for a suicide attack in Indian Kashmir on February 14, 2019 which left 41 Indian soldiers dead.\n\nPakistan\u2019s military rejects that account and says that after Indian planes intruded into its airspace, it scrambled jets and chased the Indian planes out, saying they dropped their payload harmlessly in Pakistani territory while fleeing.\n\nHere is an AFP story on the February 26, 2019 incident.\n\nThe misleading video has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here, here, and here where it has been viewed more than 400,000 times since it was posted February 26, 2019.\n\nA reverse image search using keyframes from the misleading video found that the footage is actually from a military simulation video game called Arma 2.\n\nThe original footage was uploaded to a YouTube gaming channel called Double Doppler on July 9, 2015 with a title: \u2018Really Short Engagement (ft. Taliban) - Apache Gunner FLIR Cam #6 - Arma 2\u2019\n\nBelow is the original footage:\n\nThe caption of the video on YouTube says: \u201c Gunner perspective in the US Army Apache during battle, using FLIR camera with M230 sound mod.
