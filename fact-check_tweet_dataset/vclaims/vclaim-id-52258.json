According to the paper, all three authors own shares or have stock options in the company.\n\nThe paper begins with a discussion of how the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, came about. The study says that this is an important first step because \u201cmistaken assumptions\u201d about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 \u201crisk creating ineffective or actively harmful vaccines\u201d.\n\nWithin this section, the study authors write about data showing that there are \u201cinserted sections placed on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike surface\u201d, which may explain how the virus binds with human cells. The paper in its current published and peer-reviewed form doesn\u2019t say this couldn\u2019t have occurred naturally.\n\nProfessor Anne Spurkland, an immunologist from the University of Oslo who was not an author on the paper, told NRK, the Norwegian state broadcaster, that this is not evidence that the virus was man-made. Another vaccine researcher, Gunnveig Gr\u00f8deland, who was also not involved in the paper, told NRK that these sequences can occur when a virus mutates and are found in other viruses including HIV and other coronaviruses.\n\nSo where did these claims come from?\n\nThe Telegraph reports that \u201can earlier version of the paper that it has seen concluded that coronavirus should correctly be called \"Wuhan virus\" and claimed to have proven \"beyond reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus is engineered\u201d.\n\nIn the podcast interview, Sir Richard says that the paper \u201chas been rewritten many times\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, the paper was initially rejected by leading academic journals, and \u201cwas watered down to remove explicit accusations against China, and the rewritten study was then judged to be of sufficient scientific merit.\u201d The Telegraph also writes that \u201cone of the authors, John Fredrik Moxnes, the chief scientific adviser to the Norwegian military, asked for his name to be withdrawn from the research, throwing its credibility into doubt.\u201d\n\nA few days after the Telegraph story was published, NRK published an article in which they spoke to co-author of the paper, Dr S\u00f8rensen about the origins of the new coronavirus. It reported that \u201caccording to the researchers [S\u00f8rensen and Dagleish] sequences in this protein may indicate that the virus does not have a natural origin.\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, Dr S\u00f8rensen refutes having papers rejected as reported by the Telegraph, saying that the work was divided into two. The published paper, referred to above, is about vaccine development, whilst the second \u201cgoes deeper into the question of whether the virus is man-made\u201d and is yet to be published.\n\nSeveral corrections now appear at the top of that NRK article, including the clarification that the claim that \u201csequences in the coronavirus spike protein appear to be artificially inserted\u201d was not from the research article but \u201cbased on statements from S\u00f8rensen to NRK\u201d. These were added after the Norwegian fact checker, Faktisk, asked NRK questions about the article.\n\nAs we have written about before, it is widely agreed by scientists that the new coronavirus came from an animal source and could not have been engineered in a lab.", "lang": "en"}
