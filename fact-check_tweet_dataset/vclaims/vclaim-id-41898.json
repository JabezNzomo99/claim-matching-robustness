The DHS cannot mobilize the National Guard in this manner.\n\nThe viral post urges Americans to stockpile necessities before the National Guard, purportedly mobilized by the DHS, begins to enforce a nationwide 14-day quarantine in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Similar claims have also circulated in the form of text messages in recent weeks.\n\nThe White House National Security Council debunked similar text message rumors of a national quarantine in mid-March.\n\n\u201cText message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE,\u201d reads the tweet. \u201cThere is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID-19. #coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe Ascension and Iberia Parish Offices of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness in Louisiana also debunked the image, noting that DHS cannot mobilize the National Guard in this manner. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Train Car With COVID-19 Marking)\n\n\u201cThe Department of Homeland Security does not have authority to mobilize the National Guard as described in the graphic,\u201d Maj. Rob Perino, spokesman for the National Guard Bureau, confirmed to the Daily Caller in an email. \u201cAdditionally, there is no discussion of a nation-wide quarantine.\u201d\n\nNational Guard members across the country have been activated to support states\u2019 responses to the new coronavirus \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t include a national quarantine of any kind. They are \u201csupporting community based testing sites, creating additional medical capacity, and providing logistical support to include transportation and distribution of medical supplies and food,\u201d according to Perino.\n\nThe post also misinterprets the Stafford Act, which President Donald Trump invoked when he declared a national emergency on March 13. That federal disaster relief law actually empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist state and local governments in dealing with the outbreak and to coordinate the country\u2019s response.\n\nOn April 16, Trump announced guidelines laying out a \u201cphased and deliberate approach\u201d to restoring normal activity in areas that have strong testing and are seeing a decrease in coronavirus cases, according to The Associated Press.", "lang": "en"}
