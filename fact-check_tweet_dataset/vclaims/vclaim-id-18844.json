Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of the current real situation (stone-pelting) in Kashmir. Fact: The video in the post is an old video. The clashes shown in the video took place in Srinagar in June-2018 after the killing of Dawood Salafi by the security forces in a gunfight in Anantnag. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, it was found that the same video was uploaded by \u2018RT Arabic\u2019 on June 22nd, 2019. So, it is an old video. When looked for any news on this incident, an article published by \u2018Greater Kashmir\u2019 on this issue can be found in the search results. The title of the article reads, \u201cMassive clashes erupt in HMT Srinagar after killing of ISJK chief in Anantnag gunfight\u201d. More photos from these clashes can be seen here and further information on the Anantnag gunfight can be read here. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, an old stone-pelting video taken after the killing of Dawood Salafi is being shared as the current situation in J&K.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
