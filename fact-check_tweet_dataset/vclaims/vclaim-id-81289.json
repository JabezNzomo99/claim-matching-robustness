Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) mixed apples and oranges, cited out-of-date numbers and then inflated the total.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2015-02-17T20:11:07Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-81289", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/04/07/mcconnells-stale-inflated-claim-on-health-plan-cancellations/", "vclaim": "We have explained before that, depending on the phrasing, this can be a misleading comparison. But the gap in the numbers in McConnell\u2019s op-ed jumped out at The Fact Checker, especially because Kentucky is a rare example of a red state building an exchange that, by most accounts, has operated smoothly. What\u2019s behind these numbers?\n\nThat adds up to 280,000, but already McConnell\u2019s comparison looks like a shaky case of apples and oranges. The 68,000 individual plans sold on the exchange (now 77,000) mentioned in his article can be related only to the 130,000 individual plan policies. Adding in small-group policies inflates the total.\n\nRonda Sloan, a spokeswoman for the department, said there was some confusion in the reporting about what the November statement meant, in that the 280,000 figure \u201cwas simply the number of people in the individual and small-group markets at that time who potentially could have received a letter saying their health insurance policies were being discontinued\u201d because benefits were changing.\u201d\n\nIn other words, when the state made the announcement, it did not know how many plans might actually comply with the law; it just described the size of the individual and small-group markets.\n\nThe statement also stressed that \u201cdiscontinuation notices\u201d would be mailed when policies were up for renewal. We have no idea what the flow would be, but just taking a simple average over 12 months yields 11,000 individual policies a month. That adds up to only 55,000 individual policies since November, yet McConnell assumed that all of the notices had been mailed and received. (Letters from insurance companies posted on the department\u2019s Web site indicate that at least 40,000 were sent through December.)\n\nFinally, it turns out that the 280,000 figure is out of date. In December, the state said it had determined that more than 48,000 plans were grandfathered in under ACA and that nearly 64,000 qualified for transitional relief under an administrative fix announced by the Obama administration. (The state did not distinguish between individual and small-group plans in its announcement, but overall that\u2019s a 40 percent reduction.)\n\nThat brought the total down to 168,000, a figure that was reported in the Kentucky news media under headlines such as, \u201cNumber of Kentuckians Who Must Upgrade Health Plans Under Obamacare Lower Than Expected.\u201d Newspapers in Kentucky have quoted other GOP lawmakers, such as State Senate President Robert Stivers, as using the revised figure.\n\nJust one month had passed from the first announcement, so \u201conly a small number of the 280,000 ever received a discontinuation notice,\u201d Sloan said. She noted that insurance companies gave the remaining plans the option to take early renewal (to continue pre-ACA plans) through at least Dec. 1, 2014.\n\nKentucky has not decided whether to accept the administration\u2019s offer to extend transitional relief through 2016. But at the very least, nearly 20 percent of Kentuckians in the initial estimate never did and never will receive letters because their plans complied with the law. Although exact numbers are not available, that suggests the individual market pool affected by the law was closer to 100,000 than 130,000 \u2014 and certainly not 280,000.\n\nOne interesting side note: State officials say preliminary research indicates that 75 percent of the people who signed up for private plans on the state exchange were previously uninsured. That suggests that the 77,000 figure cannot be easily compared to the 130,000 people who had insurance in Kentucky\u2019s individual market before the new health-care law took effect.\n\n\u201cThe op-ed pointed out that while Democrats were yelling \u2018mission accomplished,\u2019 Kentuckians who lost the plan they had [despite being promised the opposite] weren\u2019t popping any champagne corks,\u201d McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said. \u201cAnd while the Democrats may only want to point to people who have signed up, the point the leader made was that they were failing to count the consequences of their failed law. It makes sense to compare apples and oranges \u2014 because both groups were lied to.\u201d\n\nUnlike some Republican lawmakers, McConnell was not claiming that there has been a reduction in the number of insured or that 216,000 remained uninsured. In that respect, his comment was carefully crafted. But McConnell\u2019s claim that 280,000 Kentuckians have received cancellation notices does not hold up to scrutiny.\n\nAlthough 280,000 was a broad estimate released by the state in November, Kentucky officials reduced the figure by 40 percent just a month later \u2014 and yet McConnell is still citing outdated numbers. Moreover, because termination notices are sent on a rolling basis, it\u2019s likely that far few notices have even been sent.\n\nFinally, even if 280,000 was correct and even if all notices had been sent, it\u2019s still the wrong number to use when referring to individual health plans purchased on the exchange, as 280,000 is the sum of individual and small-group plans.", "lang": "en"}
