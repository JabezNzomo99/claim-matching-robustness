Compared to west Africa, America has well-resourced health care services, as well as federal programs and agencies dedicated to preventing public health crises in the United States.\n\nBut that\u2019s no thanks to Rep. Tom Cotton, says incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor in his . Pryor\u2019s running against Cotton, a Republican, to keep his seat.\n\n\"Tom Cotton voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola,\" the ad\u2019s narrator says. \"Congressman Cotton voted to cut billions from our nation\u2019s medical disaster and emergency programs. He was the only Arkansas congressman to vote this way. Just like he was the only one to vote against Children\u2019s Hospital. Instead, Cotton voted massive tax cuts for billionaires. Not protect our families\u2019 health and safety.\"\n\nAs a tea party Republican, Cotton has a of voting against federal government spending, including spending on . But tying Cotton to a potential Ebola outbreak caught our attention.\n\nThis year, Ebola has killed more than 1,400 people in west Africa as of Aug. 20 and is the largest ever recorded outbreak, according to the .\n\nNo cases have been recorded in the United States, though two American health care workers contracted the virus while in Liberia and were treated in an Atlanta hospital.\n\nWe asked Pryor\u2019s campaign for evidence backing up their claim, and they said the ad refers to the . The law -- passed in March 2013 -- continues funding various medical and public health emergency preparedness programs through 2018. (The first iteration of the law was passed in 2006.)\n\nAs you might guess from the name, the law pertains to preventing pandemics, like Ebola, from breaking out in the United States.\n\nSeveral programs funded under the act are already working on Ebola response, such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said Gretchen Michaels, a spokeswoman for the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services).\n\nAdditionally, the law\u2019s 2013 reauthorization gave the Food and Drug Administration the ability to authorize use of unapproved products in the case of an emergency. So , the FDA authorized use of a new tool for diagnosing Ebola, as well as .\n\nDid Cotton try to stop this legislation? At first, it seems that way.\n\npassed the legislation Jan. 22, 2013, with strong bipartisan support and very little opposition -- 395 to 29. Cotton voted against it, along with 28 other Republicans.\n\nThe bill moved on to the Senate, where lawmakers made a few changes, passed it by a voice vote, and sent it back to the House to approve the changes. The House once again of the bill with an overwhelming majority from both parties.\n\nThis time around, Cotton changed his position and voted for the bill. (Seven other Republicans who previously voted \"nay\" also changed their vote.)\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Cotton didn\u2019t vote for it the first time. The law passed with such little debate that it went over without much media attention.\n\nWe reached out to Cotton\u2019s campaign but haven\u2019t heard back -- though they posted on their website refuting the claim.\n\nAccording to , the major difference between the House and Senate version of the act is that the House version approves funding and programs through 2017, while the Senate version goes through 2018.\n\nWe also used a between the two texts and found that the final version includes a clause clarifying that state and local workers asked to temporarily take on a different assignment in case of an emergency would not be required to accept that reassignment.\n\nRegardless, the country\u2019s ability to address a pandemic does not hinge on either of those changes.\n\nThere is no readily available evidence showing that Cotton actively campaigned against the bill. And the final version, which got Cotton\u2019s vote, also got positive votes from nearly every Senate and House Democrat -- including Pryor.\n\nA Pryor for Senate ad said, \"Tom Cotton voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola.\"\n\nCotton voted against one version of a 2013 pandemic and emergency preparedness bill. However, Cotton voted for the final version, which Pryor also supported. The bill easily became law.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
