In fact, we\u2019re pleased to say this was a banner month for The Fact Checker, smashing all previous traffic records.\n\n1: \u2018Hands up, don\u2019t shoot\u2019 did not happen in Ferguson\n\n\u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d came to symbolize the need to hold law enforcement accountable in the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown at the hands of police officer Darren Wilson. But an extensive Justice Department investigation concluded that Wilson did not know whether Brown was armed, that he acted out of self-defense and that he was justified in killing Brown. The majority of witnesses told federal investigators that the initial claims that Brown\u2019s hands were up were not accurate. We concluded that \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d was worthy of Four Pinocchios.\n\n2: Ted Cruz\u2019s claim that there has been \u2018zero\u2019 global warming in 17 years\n\nUsing cherry-picked data, Cruz claimed that there has been \u201czero warming\u201d or \u201cno recorded warming\u201d since 1998, though he later modified his comment to say there is no significant warming. It turns out that 1998 was particularly warm, because of an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. Moreover, a range of available data, including ocean heat content, data about glaciers receding, sea-level-height data and others, all point to continued global warming even after 1998. Cruz earned three Pinocchios.\n\n3: Obama\u2019s claim that Keystone XL oil \u2018bypasses the U.S.\u2019 earns Four Pinocchios\n\nPresident Obama repeated false claims about the Keystone pipeline that had previously earned him Pinocchios, yet he managed to be even more misleading than before by suggesting that the pipeline would have no benefit for American producers. Moreover, his remarks are contradicted by the analysis of his own State Department. Thus the president earned Four Pinocchios.\n\nSpeaking to students at a South Carolina college, Obama made a number of exaggerated statements about guns, including that U.S. homicide rates are higher \u201cby a mile\u201d than those in other industrialized countries. He earned Three Pinocchios.\n\n5: Is the controversial Indiana law \u2018the same\u2019 as a law backed by Obama?\n\nNumerous readers requested a ruling on whether Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) was correct that the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed into law in Indiana was the same as an Illinois bill supported by then-state-Sen. Barack Obama in 1998. There is a case that the two laws are roughly similar. But there are certainly some differences \u2014 which might have become important as cases based on the law made their way through the courts. (Under pressure, the Indiana legislature amended it to address concerns the law could be used to target gays.)\n\nConservatives frequently cite the influence of Frank Marshall Davis, a friend of Obama\u2019s grandfather, on the president\u2019s thinking. We provided a definitive look at Davis\u2019s Communist Party activities and his relationship with Obama, based on competing research by those who have spent years trying to posthumously vindicate or indict Davis. We carefully considered the facts underlying this assertion, and the evidence is slim that Marshall was a close mentor.", "lang": "en"}
