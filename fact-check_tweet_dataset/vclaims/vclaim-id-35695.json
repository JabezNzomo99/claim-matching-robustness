Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Vice President Joe Biden shot back, arguing that experience is what\u2019s needed to take on Trump.\n\nOn stage at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., were Biden, Buttigieg, businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer, and senators Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nWe fact-checked their claims on health care, foreign policy, taxes, and attacks on Trump.\n\nKlobuchar: \"You sent out a tweet just a few years ago you said henceforth, forthwith you are for Medicare for All for the ages.\"\n\nButtigieg: \"The truth is I have been consistent throughout in my position on health care for every American.\"\n\nKlobuchar and Buttigieg sparred over his record of support for Medicare for All, the single-payer health care bill that Bernie Sanders backs. Klobuchar noted that Buttigieg previously tweeted in favor of the bill and has since changed his position. Buttigieg said he has been consistent on supporting an approach that would bring health care to all Americans.\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s point \u2014 that Buttigieg has at least expressed support for the specific bill, and no longer does \u2014 is supported by evidence.\n\nThe tweet was posted on Feb. 18, 2018. Buttigieg wrote, \"I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for All, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered.\"\n\nSince then, Buttigieg has narrowed his stance \u2014 backing \"Medicare for all who want it,\" a plan he argues would also achieve universal coverage, by letting people opt into a public health plan, and offering more generous subsidies for those who purchase private insurance. (Proponents of single-payer are skeptical it would succeed.)\n\nTo be fair, even Buttigieg\u2019s 2018 statement includes an important qualifier \u2014 he\u2019s not tied to the plan. He favors Medicare for All, he says, as he does \"any measure that would help get all Americans covered.\" If you agree that his current plan would also achieve universal health care, there\u2019s an argument that he has been consistent.\n\nBiden: Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan \"would cost more than the entire federal budget that we spend now.\"\n\nThis is not accurate. We contacted Biden\u2019s campaign, who directed us to the 2018 federal budget \u2014 $4.1 trillion \u2014 compared to the estimated $32 trillion price tag of Sanders\u2019 single-payer proposal. But there\u2019s a problem: That latter number is an estimate of the cost for 10 years. So putting one year of the budget against a decade of health spending is comparing apples and oranges.\n\nAnd converting one year\u2019s budget to a decade-long forecast is an economically complex proposition \u2014 it\u2019s not as simple as just multiplying by 10.\n\nWe also ran this claim by an independent expert, who crunched the $32 trillion estimate. Linda Blumberg, an institute fellow at the Urban Institute, told us Biden\u2019s comparison is \"an exaggeration\" and \"overstatement.\"\n\nCertainly, she said, Medicare for All would be \"a bigger increase to the federal budget than we\u2019ve ever experienced\" \u2014 more than a 70% increase, compared to the CBO\u2019s 10-year budget estimate.\n\n\"This is an enormous increase, but it wouldn\u2019t double\" the budget, she said.\n\nWarren: \"36 million Americans last year couldn\u2019t afford to fill a prescription, including those with insurance.\"\n\nThis is True. If anything, it falls a little short.\n\nThe data comes from a Commonwealth Fund estimate. Researchers found that in 2018, 37 million non-elderly Americans, about 1 in 5 people, skipped a prescription because they couldn\u2019t afford it. Some of those people had coverage. Others were \"underinsured.\" That means they had insurance, but it wasn\u2019t enough to safeguard them from large medical bills.\n\nOther data suggests it\u2019s potentially even worse. A November poll from West Health and Gallup estimated that 58 million Americans experienced what they called \"medication insecurity\" in the past 12 months.\n\nWarren: \"How about we start with what a president can do \u2014 I love saying this \u2014 all by herself? On day one I will defend the Affordable Care Act and use march-in orders to reduce the costs of commonly used prescription drugs like insulin and HIV/AIDS drugs and EpiPens.\"\n\nIt is True that the president has these executive powers. But it\u2019s likely it would be difficult.\n\nWarren has in her \"Medicare for All\" transition plan a pledge that she would use two legal mechanisms to achieve this goal \u2014 \"compulsory licensing\" and march-in rights.\n\nCompulsory licensing means the government will take over a patent if a drug\u2019s prices are too high and create competition. There is precedent for this approach, it was done in the 1960s for cheap generic drugs, and in 2001 for Ciprofloxacin during the anthrax scare. Experts said this likely couldn\u2019t be applied to all drugs but could work for insulin and EpiPens.\n\nMarch-in rights are when the government \"marches in\" during a public health crisis because a drug isn\u2019t available. But it only works for drugs in which the government holds all of the patents, such as Truvada, the HIV prevention drug. However, this mechanism has never been employed and it\u2019s unclear whether high prescription drug prices would qualify as a public health concern. Officials at the National Institutes of Health would also have to approve this measure, and it would face significant backlash from the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nSanders\u2019 math holds up \u2014 and is probably an underestimate.\n\nThe figure is derived by adding the \"net revenues\" for 10 pharmaceutical companies and 10 companies that work in health insurance. Multiple independent economists reviewed the methodology with, and affirmed that it\u2019s sound. In fact, the total \"net revenue\" is actually around $100.96 billion.\n\nThe talking point doesn\u2019t include health care\u2019s biggest earners, though: hospitals and health systems. When you factor them in, the level of profit in our system will grow significantly larger.\n\nSanders: \"30,000 Americans a year die waiting for health care because of the cost.\"\n\nThe way Sanders uses this number is problematic and oversimplifies the research. When we previously fact-checked this claim, we rated it Half True.\n\nIt appears that the number comes from Physicians for a National Health Program, which cited the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a study that assigned by lottery some participants to Medicaid and the others remained without insurance. A year into the experiment, researchers found that the death rate differed by 0.13 percentage points between those who were on Medicaid and those who were not \u2014 though this difference was not statistically significant. If you extrapolate this number to the number of Americans who are uninsured \u2014 about 27 million \u2014 then you do get close to a figure of about 30,000 people.\n\nHowever, experts said that since the difference was not statistically significant it shouldn\u2019t be extrapolated so broadly, and it\u2019s possible that Sanders\u2019 number is too high. Other research does show that there is a connection between being uninsured and higher likelihood of mortality. Thousands of Americans do die waiting for health care every year, but this number relies on imprecise math.\n\nButtigieg: Said Donald Trump refused \"to serve when it was his turn.\"\n\nThere is no proof that Trump orchestrated his medical deferment to avoid the draft, but questions remain. This reference to Trump\u2019s past rests on partial evidence.\n\nButtigieg, who was a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve posted to Afghanistan, was referring to Trump\u2019s Vietnam War era draft deferment. Between 1964 and mid 1968, Trump benefited from student deferments that exempted him from the military draft.\n\nAside from being a student, he had been judged 1-A, meaning available for service. When he completed his studies, he was once again classified as 1-A. Trump then saw a doctor, and a short time later his classification changed to 1-Y. It was based on a medical condition and meant he would only be drafted if there was a national emergency. Years later, Trump said it had to do with bone spurs in his heels. Trump reportedly was active in college sports, playing baseball, tennis and squash.\n\nTrump failed to mention his medical deferment when he told ABC News on July 19, 2015, that he was never drafted because the draft lottery went into effect and his birthday came with a high number.\n\n\"If I would have gotten a low number, I would have been drafted. I would have proudly served,\" he said. \"But I got a number, I think it was 356. That\u2019s right at the very end. And they didn't get, I don\u2019t believe, past even 300, so I was not chosen because of the fact that I had a very high lottery number.\"\n\nSanders: \"I am very proud that today I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA.\"\n\nWe rated this Mostly True when Sanders claimed it during the 2016 Democratic primary contest. Sanders\u2019 campaign back then told us that his D-minus NRA grade came during the 2012 election cycle, as shown in the NRA lobby group\u2019s subscriber-only database. The NRA in 2016 corroborated Sanders\u2019 low score.\n\nThe grade technically comes from the NRA\u2019s political action committee, the NRA-Political Victory Fund. It has graded Sanders as far back as 1992, when he ran for his second term for Congress as an independent from Vermont. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Sanders got five straight Fs. The group gave him a D-plus in 2004 and a C-minus in 2006, his first bid for the Senate.\n\nSanders\u2019 record on gun control has been scrutinized in the 2016 and 2020 election cycles. Biden claimed, accurately, that Sanders in the 1990s voted five times against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Here\u2019s an overview of Sanders\u2019 record on gun control.\n\nYang: Says that Amazon \"is literally paying zero in taxes.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not the case for 2019. Amazon\u2019s latest regulatory filing said it estimated it would pay $162 million in federal income tax for 2019.\n\nYang\u2019s claim has more standing for 2017 and 2018. Amazon did not expect to pay federal income tax for those years, reporting a federal income tax bill of negative $137 million in 2017 and negative $129 million in 2018, according to its annual 10-K filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAmazon\u2019s tax returns are private, but experts have told us that the best and closest source of information on Amazon\u2019s tax liabilities can be inferred from the SEC filings.\n\nButtigieg: Says Trump withdrew from \"the Iran nuclear deal that his own administration certified was working.\"\n\nThis is accurate. The 2015 multinational agreement that rolled back Iran\u2019s nuclear program, lifted sanctions, and opened the country to international inspections required regular certification of compliance. The formal name of the agreement is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.\n\nIn a State Department briefing March 21, 2018, director of Policy Planning Brian Hook said Iran was living up the deal. Under the agreement, Iran gave up 97% of its stockpile of enriched uranium. It also lost 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges, the machines used to enrich uranium, and it agreed to only enrich uranium to a level unsuitable for weapons for 15 years. It also had to dismantle its plutonium reactor.\n\n\"They are in technical compliance with their commitments under the JCPOA,\" Hook said.\n\nOn May 8, 2018, Trump announced that the United States would re-impose economic sanctions on Iran and Washington would no longer hold to the agreement.", "lang": "en"}
