The combined Facebook engagements of these posts reached over 3,700 shares, 4,100 reactions, and 590 comments.\n\nThe facts: The \"signatures\" of Jovito Salonga and Corazon Aquino in the letter are different from samples shown in laws they signed. The PCGG also never said Ferdinand Marcos had no ill-gotten wealth and is still chasing traces of the family's stolen funds to this day.\n\nBy August 1986 when Salonga\u2019s alleged letter was dated, the Swiss Executive Council had already frozen Marcos\u2019 bank accounts in Switzerland 4 months prior \u2013 or in April that year \u2013 after the PCGG requested legal assistance from Swiss authorities.

Senator Richard Gordon said the PCGG has collected at least P171 billion over the years despite a limited budget.
