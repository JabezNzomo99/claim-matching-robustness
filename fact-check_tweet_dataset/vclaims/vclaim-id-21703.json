But when Obama didn\u2019t launch such intervention, \u201cI think that set us back a long ways,\u201d Trump said. However, Trump ignores his repeated calls at the time to \u201cnot attack Syria.\u201d\n\nTrump is free to criticize President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of Syria and the \u201cred-line\u201d episode. As we said in 2013, Obama blurred the facts on the issue in trying to downplay his remarks. But Trump\u2019s comment also blurs the history of his own statements on the issue.\n\nThe White House released a brief statement by Trump on April 4, the day a chemical bombing in a rebel-held area of northern Syria killed dozens of people. Humanitarian groups said the death toll was as high as 100, the New York Times reported. Trump blamed the Syrian government for the attack, but also the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nIn an April 5 press conference with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah, Trump again criticized Obama, saying: \u201cI think the Obama administration had a great opportunity to solve this crisis a long time ago when he said the red line in the sand. And when he didn\u2019t cross that line after making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways, not only in Syria but in many other parts of the world because it was a blank threat.\u201d\n\nTrump said the recent chemical attack had \u201ca big impact on me\u201d and that his \u201cattitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much,\u201d but he stopped short of saying he had changed his mind about military intervention in Syria. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m doing anything one way or the other,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the time of the red-line episode, Trump didn\u2019t describe it as \u201ca great opportunity to solve this crisis.\u201d He instead advocated not intervening in Syria.\n\nLet\u2019s look back at Obama\u2019s 2012 statement, subsequent actions and Trump\u2019s public statements at the time.\n\nIn an Aug. 20, 2012, press conference, Obama was asked whether he \u201cenvision[ed] using U.S. military\u201d in Syria \u201cif simply for nothing else, the safekeeping of the chemical weapons.\u201d Obama said, \u201cI have, at this point, not ordered military engagement in the situation. But the point that you made about chemical and biological weapons is critical. \u2026 We have been very clear to the [Bashar] Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. \u2026 We have communicated in no uncertain terms with every player in the region that that\u2019s a red line for us and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on the chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons.\u201d\n\nMonths later, some Republicans pressed Obama to enforce that red line in some way \u2014 though not with a commitment of troops \u2014 when the U.S. believed Assad had used chemical weapons.\n\nAnd in August 2013, a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs killed more than 1,400 people, an act the U.S. determined with \u201chigh confidence\u201d was conducted by the Assad government. Days later, on Sept. 4, 2013, as the president was seeking support for military action, Obama claimed that his \u201cred-line\u201d statement wasn\u2019t his red line, but instead one set by the international community and Congress, which had passed legislation in 2003 forbidding Syria from using chemical weapons.\n\nTrump\u2019s stance at the time? He was firmly in the \u201cstay out of Syria\u201d camp. As the New York Times noted, he tweeted more than a dozen times about Syria in 2013, urging Obama not to take action. Through Trump\u2019s prolific use of Twitter, he advised Obama to \u201cforget Syria,\u201d to \u201cNOT attack Syria\u201d and to \u201cstay out of Syria.\u201d And he urged Obama to \u201cnot attack\u201d regardless of what Trump called Obama\u2019s \u201cvery dumb RED LINE statement.\u201d Some examples:\n\nOn Aug. 29, 2013, Trump\u2019s tweet on the topic said that \u201cObama needs Congressional approval\u201d for action in Syria, which is exactly what Obama sought two days later.\n\nOn Aug. 31, 2013, Obama, who had been considering ordering a military strike unilaterally, decided to seek Congress\u2019 approval. But there was plenty of division on such an authorization among lawmakers, and public opinion polls showed low support for military action. By mid-September, Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, had reached a diplomatic solution: an agreement between the United States and Russia to have Syria turn over its chemical weapons to international inspectors \u2014 a problematic agreement as it turns out.\n\nIn a Sept. 13, 2013, interview on CNN, Trump criticized Obama for indecision: \u201cWell, it all began when we he used the term red line, he\u2019s going to draw a line in the sand essentially and don\u2019t cross,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat they crossed but he didn\u2019t do anything and then it became very late, and he decides to go back to Congress, and Congress is having fits over it, and it looks like he wasn\u2019t going to even come close to getting to vote and he started looking very, very ineffective.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most incredible thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed as opposed to just either doing it or nothing,\u201d Trump said, adding that he didn\u2019t think military intervention should be done.\n\nTrump maintained his position of no intervention during the presidential campaign, even disagreeing with Mike Pence, his running mate, on the topic during the second presidential debate.\n\nPoliticians are certainly free to change their minds, and Trump indicated in his April 5 press conference that his attitude toward Assad had changed. And, as we said, Trump is free to criticize the Obama administration\u2019s actions. But the president\u2019s claim that Obama missed \u201ca great opportunity to solve this crisis\u201d when Obama set a red line glosses over Trump\u2019s past statements against intervention.", "lang": "en"}
