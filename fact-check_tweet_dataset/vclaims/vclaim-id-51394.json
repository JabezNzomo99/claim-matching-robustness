But this is misleading, as there was no special exemption; rather, government activity is considered an essential service and the US Capitol is not covered by the mayor\u2019s order, her office said.\n\n\u201cWashington DC\u2019s mayor is exempting members of Congress who attended John Lewis\u2019 funeral in Georgia from her mandatory 14-day quarantine. Let that sink in,\u201d said an August 2, 2020 post shared 14,000 times on the Facebook page of Conservative News Today.\n\nThe owner of the page is BizPac Review, which posted the same claim on its own page.\n\nBoth pages include links to the BizPac Review website, which says it provides \u201cnews and analysis unfiltered by the liberal bias that has eroded the media\u2019s credibility.\u201d Among the \u201ctop conservatives\u201d who have touted it are Donald Trump Jr, the president\u2019s son, according to the site.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and around 50 other members of Congress attended the funeral of Lewis at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia on July 30. Republican Representatives Barry Loudermilk of Georgia and Kevin Brady of Texas were among those present.\n\nLewis\u2019s body had earlier lain in state at the US Capitol, a rarely-bestowed honor.\n\nHe represented a Georgia district in the House of Representatives for 33 years until his death from cancer on July 17.\n\nHis funeral was held three days after an order took effect from DC Mayor Muriel Bowser \u201cthat persons self-quarantine for 14 days after traveling for non-essential purposes from high-risk areas to the District,\u201d in order to curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cEssential travel\u201d -- exempt from self-quarantine -- is defined under an earlier order from the mayor as including that related to \u201cessential government activities\u201d as well as travel \u201crequired to visit a house of worship.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment activity is essential, and the Capitol of the United States is exempt from the Mayor\u2019s Order,\u201d Bowser\u2019s press secretary Susana Castillo told AFP by email.\n\nWashington DC\u2019s government lists Georgia as one of 27 high-risk states \u201cwhere the seven-day moving average of daily new COVID-19 cases is 10 or more per 100,000 persons.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s order states that those who return to the US capital after essential travel to a high-risk state must still monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19 for two weeks, even though they do not have to self-quarantine.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 570 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus crisis.
