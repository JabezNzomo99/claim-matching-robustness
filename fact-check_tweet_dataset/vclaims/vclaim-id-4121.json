Mueller III and his investigative team.\n\u2022 Trump said, \u201cIn all fairness, Bob Mueller worked for [President] Obama for eight years.\u201d Mueller was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, and served longer under Bush than he did under Obama.\n\u2022 He described Mueller\u2019s team as \u201ca group of investigators that are all Democrats.\u201d That\u2019s an exaggeration: 13 of the 17 team members are registered Democrats.\n\u2022 Speaking of Mueller\u2019s investigators, Trump also said, \u201cIn some cases, they went to the Hillary Clinton celebration that turned out to be a funeral.\u201d The White House provided us with only one name.\n\nTrump\u2019s accusations against Mueller and his lawyers came when he was asked by a reporter on May 4 whether he had changed his mind and would be willing to sit with Mueller for an interview. Mueller and his team are investigating Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election and any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe president questioned whether he would be \u201ctreated fairly\u201d by the special counsel\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cWell, the problem with sitting is this: You have a group of investigators, and they say that I am not a target, and I\u2019m not a target. But you have a group of investigators that are all Democrats. In some cases, they went to the Hillary Clinton celebration that turned out to be a funeral,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cSo you have all these investigators. They\u2019re Democrats,\u201d Trump added. \u201cIn all fairness, Bob Mueller worked for Obama for eight years.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with Trump\u2019s claim that, \u201cIn all fairness, Bob Mueller worked for Obama for eight years.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mueller was nominated by Bush in 2001 to serve as FBI director, and the Senate unanimously confirmed his appointment 98-0. Mueller took over the job on Sept. 4, 2001 and served throughout the remainder of Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nMueller continued as FBI director under Obama. In 2011, facing a 10-year term limit, Obama asked Mueller to extend his tenure by an additional two years; and the Senate again unanimously signed off on that. So Mueller served as FBI Director until Sept. 4, 2013, exactly 12 years in total.\n\nIndeed, Mueller served longer under Bush \u2014 about seven years and four months \u2014 than he did under Obama \u2014 roughly four years and eight months.\n\nTrump also took aim at Mueller\u2019s investigative team, saying they are \u201call Democrats.\u201d That\u2019s an embellishment.\n\nAs we have written before, a spokesman for the special counsel told us the special counsel doesn\u2019t maintain any records on party affiliation of the staff. However, the Washington Post reported that 13 of the 17 team members are registered Democrats. The four remaining members of the team have no party affiliation, or researchers at the Post were unable to find any record of an affiliation.\n\nSix of the nine team members who have made contributions to federal candidates gave money to Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, totaling at least $11,436. Five of the team members donated a total of $8,800 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Information on the contributions is available through the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 website.\n\nWe should also note, Mueller was described as a registered Republican by the Washington Post when Bush first appointed him as FBI director in 2001. He was appointed special counsel last year by Rod Rosenstein, a Republican who was tapped by Trump to be deputy attorney general.\n\nRosenstein told a Senate panel last year that political donations are \u201cnot a disqualification\u201d for a lawyer serving on the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump also claimed that, \u201cIn some cases, they [Mueller team investigators] went to the Hillary Clinton celebration that turned out to be a funeral.\u201d\n\nAsked for backup for that claim, the White House press office referred us to an article in the Wall Street Journal, which reported that Andrew Weissmann, now a Mueller deputy, \u201cattended Hillary Clinton\u2018s election-night party at the Jacob K. Javits Center in New York, according to people familiar with his attendance.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the Wall Street Journal states, Weissmann was running the Justice Department\u2019s fraud section. As a member of Mueller\u2019s special counsel team, the paper notes, Weissmann led the cases against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and campaign aide Rick Gates.\n\nSo that\u2019s one, but not \u201csome,\u201d as the president says. His press office did not provide information that any other Mueller team investigator attended Clinton\u2019s election-night event.", "lang": "en"}
