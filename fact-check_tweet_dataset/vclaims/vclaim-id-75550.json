(The International Basketball Federation is more commonly known as 'FIBA' an acronym stemming from its French name F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Basket-ball.)\n\nA Facebook post by 'India Rising' got over 20,000 likes and more than 36,000 shares.\n\nWhile we are happy when our women\u2019s team succeeds in any sport, those on social media who made this image have got their facts horribly wrong.\n\nThe Indian basketball team was promoted to the Division A from Division B for the next edition of Women\u2019s Asia Cup in 2019, after having defeated Kazakhstan in the final on 29th July, according to the Basketball Federation of India. In short, this win against Kazakhstan has helped India to qualify to play in Division A in 2019. A phenomenal achievement by any standard.\n\nAlso this win against Kazakhstan cannot be called equivalent to winning the FIBA Asia Cup 2017 as the image claims. FIBA\u2019s own website gives us the name of the winner of this year\u2019s Asia Cup. Japan defeated Australia with a thrilling 74-73 scoreline in the FIBA Women's Asia Cup 2017 final on July 29 in Bengaluru.\n\nFIBA's website clearly says that India defeated Kazakhstan and won the Division B crown.\n\nIt also mentions Japan being the final winner of the FIBA Women's Asia Cup 2017.\n\nWhen we searched on the Internet, we found several stories on the women\u2019s team making it to Division A, contrary to what images from India Rising and The Youth stated that the victory had gone unnoticed by mainstream media.\n\nFollowing are excerpts from newspapers and websites that covered the event.\n\n\"In something straight out of a basketball fairy tale, a Shireen Limaye jump shot in the dying seconds of the fourth quarter cemented one of India\u2019s finest wins, as they came from behind to edge out a Kazakhstan 75-73 in the Division B final of the FIBA Women\u2019s Asia Cup at the Kanteerava Indoor Stadium on Saturday,\" - FIBA Women\u2019s Asia Cup: Stunning coup by India women - Deccan Chronicle\n\n\"Kazakhstan held the size advantage over the Indian team and this was punctuated by the play of Kazakh centre Nadezhda Kondrakova.

The website says it highlights issues related to Indian youth and stories that are passed over by mainstream media. In the past The Youth posted a fake image about how India's flag was hoisted above Israel's parliament during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit in July.\n\nRead BOOM's fact check on that image - (click here)", "lang": "en"}
