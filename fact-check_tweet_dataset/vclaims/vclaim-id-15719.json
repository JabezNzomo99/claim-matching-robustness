After one woman, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, was killed by a white supremacist while she protested a rally of alt-right groups, Trump made a series of statements that politically backfired on him. In his first remarks, he condemned racism but suggested \u201cboth sides\u201d were equally at fault. Members of his CEO manufacturing council resigned in protest, and Gary Cohn, a top economic aide at the time who is Jewish, also considered resigning.\n\nThat is confirmed by Facebook videos, streamed by AWR, that show roughly three dozen militia members marching through the streets of Charlottesville, armed and dressed in military-style clothing, supposedly seeking people whose rights were being infringed. Police encouraged them to leave, according to an independent review of the day\u2019s events commissioned by Charlottesville, but they attracted attention from counterprotesters. One militia member then was hit in the head by a rock, halting their retreat. \u201cThe militia members apparently did not realize that they had stopped directly across the street from Friendship Court, a predominantly African-American public housing complex,\u201d the review said.\n\n\u201cWe came to Charlottesville, Virginia, to tell both sides, the far right and the far left, listen, whether we agree with what you have to say or not, we agree with your right to say it, without being in fear of being assaulted by the other group,\u201d Shoaff says. But he complains, \u201cWhat happened when we came here? We were the one who were assaulted.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here? Anti-government militia groups are not racist but tend to be wary of Muslims and immigrants, according to experts who study the Patriot movement. \u201cBy and large, in my experience militia groups are not any more racist than any other group of middle-aged white men,\u201d said Amy Cooter, a Vanderbilt University scholar who has interviewed many militia members. \u201cMilitias are not about whiteness, not about racism,\u201d but their anti-Islam feelings spring from fear and ignorance of Muslims, she said.", "lang": "en"}
