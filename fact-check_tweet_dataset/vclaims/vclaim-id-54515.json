The 13th Floor post declared that \u201cThe Borghild Project was (supposedly) a super-secret attempt to stop the spread of syphilis by providing Nazi soldiers with inflatable sex dolls. That\u2019s right: Hitler invented the blow-up doll!\u201d\n\nHowever, the writer also acknowledged that the Borghild Project was a hoax: \u201cSadly, the evidence in support of this having actually happened is sketchy, so it probably isn\u2019t a true story. But \u2018Hitler invented the sex doll\u2019 is such an awesome idea, we should pretend it happened anyway. I mean, what\u2019s Hitler gonna do about it now, right?\u201d\n\nThe hoax appears to have originated with an undated post by an alleged journalist named Norbert Lenz, who hasn\u2019t published anything else. That article, entitled \u201cThe Borghild-project \u2014 a discreet matter of the III. Reich,\u201d alleged that the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden, Germany, created the dolls, which were destroyed in the Allied bombing of that city in 1945.\n\nWe sent an email the museum, which chronicles the history of medicine, asking about the hoax but have yet to receive a response. We\u2019ll update this article if we do.\n\nLaurie Marhoefer, an associate professor of history at the University of Washington, told us in an email that the hoax is built around \u201cvery real concerns [Heinrich] Himmler expressed about German men, particularly soldiers and SS men, being able to express their heterosexual sex drives, and also the syphilis prevention measures that the Nazi State took, such as regulated brothels. A lot of governments at the time did something similar. Sex dolls, however, is a hoax.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Heineman, a professor of history at the University of Iowa and author of the book \u201cBefore Porn Was Legal,\u201d told us there\u2019s no evidence inflatable sex dolls were even available during the World War II era.\n\n\u201cThe [erotica] customers were overwhelmingly veterans, and the industry had an astonishingly wide array of products on offer,\u201d Heineman told us by email. Catalogs for such items, she pointed out, \u201cwere sometimes over 150 pages long by the mid-1950s,\u201d but the items listed among those pages did not include inflatable sex dolls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that if sex dolls had existed \u2014 if men had memories of them, or if they\u2019d even heard rumors and now wanted to see one since they\u2019d returned to civilian life \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t have shown up in the erotica catalogs of the 1950s,\u201d Heineman continued. But, she added, \u201cthat\u2019s not proof they hadn\u2019t existed during the war. It\u2019s just to say that they\u2019re not showing up in a place where one would have expected to see them.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, there is no evidence that Hitler invented the inflatable sex doll, and claims that he did appear to be an urban legend. We therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
