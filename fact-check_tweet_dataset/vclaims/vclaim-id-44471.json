No, that's not true: This is a tasteless hoax being perpetrated by a conspiracy theorist who offered no evidence to support his accusations.\n\nThe claims originated from a series of videos published by Dr. Umar Johnson on January 28, 2020, one of which was titled \"Kobe Bryant's death stream, by Dr Umar Johnson\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nJohnson, a Ph.D., is a Pan African speaker who bills himself on his website as \"the most requested Black scholar in America.\"\n\nJohnson made several disturbing claims in his recent videos (another one can be seen here). In one video, he shared his belief that there are three suspects in the death of Kobe Bryant. The NBA superstar and eight others were killed on January 26, 2020, when the helicopter they were flying in crashed in thick fog in Calabasas, California, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn a video, Johnson said, \"The National Basketball Association is a suspect in Dr. Umar's investigation.\"\n\nHe went on to say, \"My second suspect is the pharmaceutical industry.\" He repeated the phrase \"pharmaceutical industry\" three more times, before adding, \"The Rockefeller Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission\" is also to blame in the victims' deaths.\n\nJohnson offered no evidence to support these assertions, but he claimed the NBA was upset that Bryant was starting a rival league in what Johnson called \"red China.\"\n\n\"Kobe Bryant's business ventures posed a threat to the NBA's success,\" Johnson said.\n\nBryant was massively popular in China, and it was well known he was interested in growing the sport there. Yet there is no reporting to suggest he was trying to start a rival league in China.\n\nJohnson later said Bryant was locked in a legal battle with \"big pharma\" over the right to use the phrase \"Black Mamba.\" While it's true that Bryant had been battling a company, Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, over the rights to use his famous nickname, the company produces dietary and weight loss supplements. It is not a \"big pharma\" biomedical company that is on par with the likes of Eli Lilly, Pfizer, or Merck & Co.\n\nJohnson's video clip ended before he may have explained why he believed the \"Trilateral Commission,\" a discussion group founded by David Rockefeller in 1973, is also a suspect in his mind.\n\nIn 2018, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Johnson was facing discipline from Pennsylvania's Board of Psychology for possibly failing to have a license. The paper said:\n\nIn 2017, The Root confirmed that Johnson had a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. The article linked to a certificate from the National Student Clearinghouse, which the author used for degree verification.\n\nThe Inquirer said Johnson is a polarizing figure with controversial views:\n\nJohnson's video musings on Kobe Bryant should not be taken seriously. They offer no evidence to support his wild assertions.\n\nWe wrote about fake news on YouTube before.
