Perry answered that it could be. He said people feel strangled by spending and taxation and they want help, according to an AP recording we reviewed in April 2010.\n\n\n\nShannon then asked Perry about some associating him with the idea of secession or sovereignty for Texas. \u201cOh, I think there\u2019s a lot of different scenarios,\u201d Perry replied. \u201cTexas is a unique place. When we came in the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, my hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention,\u201d Perry continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great union. There is absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what may come out of that? So. But Texas is a very unique place and we\u2019re a pretty independent lot to boot.\u201d\n\n\n\nPerry next fielded a question from someone else about whether Texas might now be considered a natural terorrist state \u2014 no, Perry said \u2014 and the question-and-answer period closed.\n\n\n\nAt the time, Perry\u2019s comments were widely interpreted as indicating the Republican governor believed secession could legally occur; he subsequently did not back down from that conclusion.\n\n\n\nHowever, a constitutional expert advised at the time that the Civil War long ago vanquished secession as a legal option.\n\n\n\nSanford Levinson, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said neither the Texas Constitution, the U.S. Constitution nor the Joint Resolution Annexing Texas to the United States of 1845, bestows an explicit right for the state to return to a Republic. Levinson said there is \u201cno possibility whatsoever that the United States or any court would recognize a \u2018right\u2019 to secede.\u201d\n\n\n\nLevinson noted that the 1845 resolution allows Texas to break into five new states, and it doesn\u2019t specify whether that would require congressional approval. But, he said, that\u2019s distinct from secession.\n\n\n\nDoes Perry\u2019s \u201cwho-knows-what-might-come\u201d comment support White\u2019s statement that Perry threatened to leave the union?\n\n\n\nUsing the Nexis search tool, we found 169 major newspaper articles linking Perry and secede. None quoted Perry threatening to push for secession, though critics and comedians framed his words in that way.\n\n\n\nTypically, San Antonio Express-News reporter Roy Bragg wrote in an April 19, 2009 article: \u201cThe governor didn't make an actual threat to secede.\u201d Bragg also quoted Harvey Tucker, a Texas A&M University political scientist, suggesting Perry saw political gain by speaking to secession. \u201cHe didn't intend (to) talk about it. He didn't plan it. He was just drawn into it,\u201d Tucker said.\n\n\n\nAn October 2009 article in The Dallas Morning News quoted Allison Castle, the governor's spokeswoman, saying Perry's intention in his April comment \u201cwas to point a critical finger at the federal government, not to encourage abandoning the U.S.\u201d\n\n\n\nBacon told us in an e-mail that Perry\u2019s \u201cspeculation, saying the state could secede if it wanted to, is a saber-rattling threat. Think about secession and all that is associated with it. He was not talking about it in a historical navel-gazing\u201d or constitutional-interpretive fashion.\n\n\n\nWhat we find: In a politically theatrical moment, Perry edged toward a secession threat. Then or since, however, he hasn\u2019t said Texas should quit the United States. (You wudda read all about it.)\n\n\n\nWhite\u2019s similarly theatrical statement at his party\u2019s convention is False.", "lang": "en"}
