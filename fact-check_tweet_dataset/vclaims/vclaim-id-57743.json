Tom Wolf said on April 3 that Pennsylvania residents should wear face coverings any time they leave their homes to help curb the spread of coronavirus. The announcement came the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formally recommended Americans wear face coverings in public.\n\nMore than 29,000 Facebook users recently shared a post claiming people in Pennsylvania face a \u201c$500 Fine and up to 6 Months in Jail if caught in public without mask.\u201d It also claims the penalty went into effect on April 27.

Wolf recently announced that 24 of the state\u2019s 67 counties will begin to roll back restrictions starting May 8, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nAs of midday May 5, Pennsylvania has more than 50,900 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health website.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
