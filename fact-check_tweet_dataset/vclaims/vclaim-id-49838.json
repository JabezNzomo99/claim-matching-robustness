All of the counts were related to a House intelligence committee investigation that ran parallel with a separate investigation by the Department of Justice.\n\nA key line of inquiry in the House investigation was WikiLeaks\u2019 public release of documents stolen by Russian intelligence officers that were damaging to the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and whether the Trump campaign had \u201cadvanced knowledge of or access to stolen information.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign, Stone \u2014 Trump\u2019s informal adviser \u2014 said that he had been in contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\n\n\u201cA jury later determined [Stone] lied repeatedly to members of Congress,\u201d special counsel Robert Mueller wrote in a July 11 opinion piece for the Washington Post, defending his office\u2019s prosecution of Stone. \u201cHe lied about the identity of his intermediary to WikiLeaks. He lied about the existence of written communications with his intermediary. He lied by denying he had communicated with the Trump campaign about the timing of WikiLeaks\u2019 releases. He in fact updated senior campaign officials repeatedly about WikiLeaks. And he tampered with a witness, imploring him to stonewall Congress.\u201d\n\nHere we review a July 10 statement issued by the White House press secretary about Stone\u2019s case and subsequent statements made by the president.\n\nIn its statement, the White House falsely described the special counsel\u2019s investigation as \u201cabsolutely baseless.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoger Stone is a victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump Presidency,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThere was never any collusion between the Trump Campaign, or the Trump Administration, with Russia.\u201d\n\nIt went on to say: \u201cThe simple fact is that if the Special Counsel had not been pursuing an absolutely baseless investigation, Mr. Stone would not be facing time in prison.\u201d\n\nThere was ample evidence to justify opening an investigation \u2014 even if the investigation \u201cdid not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities,\u201d as Mueller\u2019s report said.\n\nAs we wrote, the FBI launched a counterintelligence investigation on July 31, 2016, into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating with the Russian government based on information from a \u201cFriendly Foreign Government,\u201d according to the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General report on the origins of the investigation.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, told the foreign official that \u201cthe Trump team had received some kind of suggestion from Russia that it could assist \u2026 with the anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to Mrs. Clinton,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn his op-ed, Mueller explained why the FBI opened its investigation at that time.\n\n\u201cBy late 2016, the FBI had evidence that the Russians had signaled to a Trump campaign adviser that they could assist the campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to the Democratic candidate,\u201d Mueller explained. \u201cAnd the FBI knew that the Russians had done just that: Beginning in July 2016, WikiLeaks released emails stolen by Russian military intelligence officers from the Clinton campaign.\u201d\n\nMueller called Russia\u2019s actions \u201ca threat to America\u2019s democracy\u201d and said it was \u201ccritical that they be investigated and understood.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report said the investigation \u201cwas opened for an authorized investigative purpose and with sufficient factual predication.\u201d\n\nAfter opening the investigation, the FBI found other contacts between Trump campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. On June 3, 2016, for example, Donald Trump Jr. received an email promising information damaging to the Clinton campaign as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d Trump Jr. responded by saying, \u201c[I]f it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\u201d and attended the meeting in question with a Russian lawyer and others in Trump Tower on June 9.\n\nJared Kushner, who was a campaign adviser to his father-in-law at the time, issued a statement a year later to congressional investigators that said \u201cthere was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the Mueller report \u201cestablished multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government,\u201d but it \u201cdid not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\u201d\n\nThe investigation was not \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\nNo Evidence of \u2018Malice\u2019 Toward Stone\n\nThe White House statement also claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that Stone\u2019s conviction was the \u201cproduct of recklessness borne of frustration and malice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs it became clear that these witch hunts would never bear fruit, the Special Counsel\u2019s Office resorted to process-based charges leveled at high-profile people in an attempt to manufacture the false impression of criminality lurking below the surface,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThese charges were the product of recklessness borne of frustration and malice. This is why the out-of-control Mueller prosecutors, desperate for splashy headlines to compensate for a failed investigation, set their sights on Mr. Stone.\u201d\n\nIn his op-ed, Mueller said there were \u201ctwo key reasons\u201d why Stone was investigated.\n\n\u201cHe communicated in 2016 with individuals known to us to be Russian intelligence officers, and he claimed advance knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 release of emails stolen by those Russian intelligence officers,\u201d Mueller wrote.\n\nAccording to a Feb. 10 sentencing memo, Stone made at least five public statements from Aug. 8, 2016, to Aug. 18, 2016, that indicated he had a source connected to Assange. The House intelligence committee asked Stone to name the person he was referring to in those early- to mid-August statements, but he gave the committee the wrong name and then pressured that person to lie to the committee, too.\n\nOn July 11, Trump retweeted a baseless claim that Stone \u201ccommitted no crime\u201d and \u201cwas framed by Mueller.\u201d Similarly, the White House claims Mueller\u2019s office manufactured \u201cprocess-based charges.\u201d\n\nMueller and the Department of Justice have repeatedly explained why lying to federal or congressional investigators is serious business.\n\nMueller last year said lying to federal investigators \u201cstrikes at the core of their government\u2019s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable,\u201d particularly in a case of such \u201cparamount importance.\u201d\n\nIn his op-ed, Mueller said that is true of lying to congressional investigators.\n\n\u201cRussian efforts to interfere in our political system, and the essential question of whether those efforts involved the Trump campaign, required investigation,\u201d Mueller wrote in the op-ed. \u201cIn that investigation, it was critical for us (and, before us, the FBI) to obtain full and accurate information. Likewise, it was critical for Congress to obtain accurate information from its witnesses.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 10, the Department of Justice recommended that Stone serve a sentence ranging from 87 months to 108 months, or roughly seven to nine years, saying \u201c[o]bstructing such critical investigations \u2026 strikes at the very heart of our American democracy.\u201d Trump objected to the sentencing recommendation, and a day later the department filed an updated sentencing recommendation memo that left the decision up to the judge \u2014 prompting some federal prosecutors to withdraw from the case.\n\nTrump praised Attorney General William Barr in a Feb. 12 tweet \u201cfor taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought.\u201d\n\nBut even Barr recently described the prosecution of Stone as \u201crighteous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the prosecution was righteous,\u201d Barr said in an ABC News interview on July 8. \u201cAnd \u2014 I think the sentence that the judge ultimately gave \u2014 was fair.\u201d\n\nNo Evidence of \u2018Spying\u2019 on Trump Campaign\n\nA day after his decision to grant Stone clemency, Trump tweeted \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that former President Barack Obama and his vice president, Joe Biden, \u201cspied on my campaign \u2013 AND GOT CAUGHT!\u201d\n\nThe president reiterated that claim when speaking to reporters that same day when he was asked about Stone.\n\n\u201cTake a look at Biden, Sleepy Joe. Take a look at Obama,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they spied on Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. Those are the people \u2014 let me just tell you something: Those are the people that should be in trouble.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report released in December focused on the origins of the investigation, but it found no evidence of illegal \u201cspying\u201d \u2014 either before or after the FBI opened the investigation, known as Crossfire Hurricane, on July 31, 2016.\n\nThe report said that the Crossfire Hurricane team conducted an \u201cinitial analysis of links between Trump campaign members and Russia,\u201d and then opened four individual cases in August 2016 \u2014 on Trump campaign associates Papadopoulos, Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn. The IG report reviewed the department\u2019s handling of those four cases.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence that the FBI used CHSs [confidential human sources] or UCEs [undercover employees] to interact with members of the Trump campaign prior to the opening of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,\u201d the report said. \u201cAfter the opening of the investigation, we found no evidence that the FBI placed any CHSs or UCEs within the Trump campaign or tasked any CHSs or UCEs to report on the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nThe report said the interactions between the Trump campaign aides and the FBI\u2019s confidential sources \u201creceived the necessary FBI approvals\u201d and were \u201cconsensually monitored and recorded by the FBI.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Carter Page, a former campaign foreign policy adviser, the FBI used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to obtain four court-approved warrants to surveil Page, beginning in October 2016.\n\nThe IG\u2019s reported cited at least 17 \u201csignificant inaccuracies and omissions\u201d in court applications for Page\u2019s warrant \u2013 which Trump has cited in the past as evidence of political bias. But the IG report said it was unable to document any bias in the mishandling of Page\u2019s FISA applications.\n\n\u201cWe did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI\u2019s decision to seek FISA authority on Carter Page,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe White House statement also charged that the forewoman of Stone\u2019s jury had \u201cconcealed the fact that she is a member of the so-called liberal \u2018resistance\u2019 to the Trump Presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only was Mr. Stone charged by overzealous prosecutors pursing a case that never should have existed, and arrested in an operation that never should have been approved, but there were also serious questions about the jury in the case,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe forewoman of his jury, for example, concealed the fact that she is a member of the so-called liberal \u2018resistance\u2019 to the Trump Presidency. In now-deleted tweets, this activist-juror vividly and openly attacked President Trump and his supporters.\u201d\n\nStone\u2019s lawyers argued that their client should receive a new trial because social media posts by the jury forewoman suggested she had hidden a bias toward Stone when she filled out a questionnaire and was questioned in court before the jury was selected. Judge Amy Berman Jackson denied the request.\n\nThe judge wrote that \u201cwhile the social media communications may suggest that the juror has strong opinions about certain people or issues\u201d \u2014 in this case, a negative opinion of Trump \u2014 \u201cthey do not reveal that she had an opinion about Roger Stone, which is the opinion that matters.\u201d\n\nThe judge also said the defense had not shown that the forewoman, Tomeka Hart, lied when questioned before being seated. And she said the posts could easily have been found before the trial.\n\nAfter the Stone prosecutors withdrew from the case on Feb. 12 in protest of the Justice Department overruling their sentencing recommendation, the foreperson defended them on Facebook. She came under fire from Trump after other social media comments critical of Trump surfaced.\n\nWe note, however, that criminal cases require unanimous verdicts for conviction. One of Stone\u2019s jurors, Seth Cousins, wrote in the Washington Post on Nov. 22, 2019, that the conviction was based on the facts, not on politics.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: We did not convict Stone based on his political beliefs or his expression of those beliefs,\u201d Cousins wrote, adding that the \u201cevidence in this case was substantial and almost entirely uncontested.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur unanimous conclusion was this: The truth matters. Telling the truth under oath matters.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising. We rely on grants and individual donations from people like you.
