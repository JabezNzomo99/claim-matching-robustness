Since then, it has grown to a total of 2.4 million words: almost six times as long as it was in 1955 and almost twice as long as in 1985,\" the website said.\n\nHowever, the Tax Foundation also points out that tax code isn\u2019t the only thing that Americans must deal with to complete their taxes. It talks about the 7.7 million words of tax regulations from the IRS and the 60,000 pages of case law that is tax related. These are not law, but are also important pieces of understanding taxes.\n\nIf you download the Internal Revenue Code from the United States Code, also known as Title 26 in the document, the file is 6,550 pages long. Not all of that is the text of the code itself, but that is still rather lengthy. Blunt definitely got it right that the code is long, but has it doubled since 1985?\n\n\"Since it was last reformed in 1986, there have been thousands of additions and changes to the Tax Code over the last 30 years,\" said Caroline Bruckner, the Managing Director of the Kogod Tax Policy Center at American University. \u201cWe\u2019re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn\u2019t have a severance tax.\u201d\n\nA report from the Taxpayer Advocate Service to Congress in 2008 about the complexity of the tax code, outlined how the word count of tax code has grown from 1.395 million words in 2001 to 3.7 million words when the report was done. That\u2019s a 265 percent growth in word count in seven years.\n\nThe report from the Taxpayer Advocate Service stated the length of the code has more than tripled since 1975. A similar report published in 2012 by the Taxpayer Advocate Service noted 4 million words at the time of the report. That is a 286 percent growth in word count from the 2001 figure.\n\n\"Our tax laws are not static; and, in fact, when they are, they tend to create more problems than not for taxpayers. That\u2019s one reason why Congress adjusts the Tax Code so often,\" she said.\n\nSome view the volume of the tax code as the problem, but others think it is the complexity of the code and the process of collecting taxes. Bruckner believes there are ways to streamline the taxation process.\n\n\"The majority of adults in the U.S. now have a smartphone \u2014 who cares how long the tax code is if you could just pay your taxes using an app that tracks your expenses, deductions and credits for you? The challenge is how do we do that without compromising taxpayer privacy and security concerns,\" she said.", "lang": "en"}
