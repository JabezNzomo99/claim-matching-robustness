What happened?\n\nThe FBI announced in July that it had completed its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, concluding that although she and her aides were \u201cextremely careless\u201d with the handling of classified information, there was no case for criminal prosecution. In large part, Comey said, no prosecutor could bring a case because the FBI could not find evidence that indicated \u201cclearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information.\u201d\n\nWhat do we know about the new emails?\n\nNot much. In fact, it does not appear as if the FBI has yet examined them in depth. Comey, in his letter, said the new emails \u201cappear to be pertinent\u201d to the earlier investigation. He also added the FBI \u201ccannot yet assess whether the material may or may not be significant,\u201d including whether the emails contained classified information.\n\nHow many emails are there?\n\nHow did these emails get discovered?\n\nHow would State Department emails end up on Abedin\u2019s computer?\n\nAbedin had previously told the FBI that when Clinton requested a printout of an email, she would send it to one of two personal accounts because it was too clunky to use the State Department\u2019s system. She told the FBI that she also had maintained an email account for support of Weiner\u2019s campaign activities. It is unclear whether these emails were on an account that had not been disclosed to the FBI or if (and how) they ended up on the hard drive of the computer. Abedin has previously testified that she turned over to her attorneys all devices that she believed contained government work: two laptops, a BlackBerry and some files in her apartment.\n\nThere are different levels of classification. About 2,000 emails in the Clinton probe were not classified when they were sent, but were \u201cup-classified\u201d to the low-level \u201cconfidential\u201d classification after a review by intelligence agencies. But, Comey had said, \u201c110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received,\u201d including eight that were deemed Top Secret. In any case, government officials are supposed to know whether they are in possession of classified information, whether or not it is clearly marked.\n\nWas the investigation \u201creopened\u201d as Republicans claim?\n\nThis is a bit of a semantic dispute. The investigation had not been officially closed, but it had certainly been completed. Comey\u2019s letter was intended to alert Congress that information had been found (the emails on the computer) and the FBI needed to assess whether they are relevant. If it turns out these emails had been previously examined, the FBI would then determine they were not relevant. But if the emails actually had not been discovered in the initial investigation, then the FBI would make it active again.\n\nDid Comey only write to Republicans as Clinton claimed?\n\nDid Comey have to issue this letter now?\n\nThe Justice Department advised him not to make this new information public so close to the election, saying it was against government policy. But if he did not make it public, the information may still have leaked, especially as prosecutors would need court permission to use information seized in the Weiner probe in a separate investigation. In his letter, he referenced the fact that he had testified that the probe into Clinton\u2019s email server had been completed, and he wanted to update his testimony.", "lang": "en"}
