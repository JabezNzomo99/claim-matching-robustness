This will allow passengers to claim 25% of the cost of a single fare back if they experience a delay of between 15 and 29 minutes.\n\nThe scheme isn\u2019t up and running yet, but will be introduced to Great Northern, Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services on 11 December.\n\nIt will then be rolled out on other services including the South Western, West Midlands and South Eastern franchises. The government has said that all rail franchises will eventually include a requirement to introduce the Delay Repay 15 scheme.\n\nUnder the existing Delay Repay scheme, passengers can get 50% of their single ticket refunded if they\u2019re delayed for 30 minutes or more, or the full price returned to them if they have longer than 60 minutes to wait. Rail companies which aren\u2019t covered by the Delay Repay scheme have to refund at least 20% of the price of a single ticket if a train is either 30 or 60 minutes delayed, depending on the company.\n\nAt the moment, if a train is delayed for less than 30 minutes companies don\u2019t have to offer passengers compensation.", "lang": "en"}
