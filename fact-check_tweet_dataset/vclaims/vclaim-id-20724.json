Who would have thought?\u201d The White House cited a January report by the International Energy Agency that said the U.S. could become the No. 1 crude oil producer this year. That\u2019s not new. The IEA predicted in 2012 that the U.S. would become the No. 1 oil producer by 2017.\n\u2022 Trump said that \u201cwe\u2019re now exporting energy for the first time.\u201d That\u2019s false. The U.S. is not expected to become a net energy exporter until 2022. The White House said he was referring only to natural gas. The U.S. did become a net exporter of natural gas last year for the first time since 1957 \u2014 as projected by the U.S. Energy Information Administration in 2015.\n\nAt the same meeting, Trump also said the Department of Interior owns \u201calmost half the United States.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s about a fifth \u2014 not one-half.\n\nThe president, who has made energy a priority for his administration, made his remarks on energy and federal land during a White House meeting on 2018 hurricane preparedness.\n\nTrump went around the table to praise each member of his Cabinet. When he got to Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Trump made a series of boasts about U.S. energy production on the administration\u2019s watch.\n\nTrump repeatedly referred to \u201cenergy\u201d when, the White House tells us, he actually meant specific types of energy. But even so, Trump\u2019s boasts were either inaccurate or misleading.\n\nBy total primary energy production, China was the largest energy producer in 2015 and has been since 2008, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe EIA has international data only through 2015. But China that year was far ahead of the United States, and U.S. primary energy production was slightly lower in 2017 than it was in 2015. (Go to the EIA link for \u201cInternational Energy Statistics,\u201d click on \u201cselect data,\u201d and choose \u201cprimary energy\u201d for data through 2015. Primary energy production includes fossil fuels \u2014 petroleum, natural gas and coal \u2014 nuclear energy, and renewable sources of energy.)\n\nIt turns out, though, that Trump was not referring to all energy when he said that \u201cwe have become the largest energy producer in the world.\u201d\n\nThe White House said the president was talking about crude oil and referred us to a Fortune magazine story about the International Energy Agency\u2019s January Oil Market Report, which said the U.S. should overtake Saudi Arabia and perhaps Russia in 2018 to become the No. 1 crude oil producer.\n\n\u201cThis year promises to be a record-setting one for the US. Crude production of 9.9 mb/d [million barrels per day] is now at the highest level in nearly 50 years, putting it neck-and-neck with Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s second largest crude producer after Russia,\u201d IEA said in January. \u201cRelentless growth should see the US hit historic highs above 10 mb/d, overtaking Saudi Arabia and rivalling Russia during the course of 2018 \u2013 provided OPEC/non-OPEC restraints remain in place.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has averaged more than 10 million barrels per day every week since February, according to the EIA. So the U.S. remains on pace as projected by the IEA in January. But there is no indication that it has overtaken Russia.\n\nAccording to the EIA\u2019s most current monthly crude oil production data available for top producing oil countries, Russia produced about 10.6 million barrels per day, or bpd, in February, while the U.S. produced nearly 10.3 million bpd. Saudi Arabia was third at 10.1 million bpd.\n\nSince then, Russia reported producing 10.97 million bpd of crude oil for a third month in a row in May, while the U.S. four-week average reached a record 10.75 million bpd as of June 1.\n\nIf and when it does happen, the milestone won\u2019t come as a surprise \u2014 as Trump implied, when he asked, \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d The answer is: IEA.\n\nIn its 2012 World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency said the U.S. would become the top crude oil producer by 2020, largely because of technological advances that have made hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a popular method to extract natural gas and oil from tight spaces.\n\nAt a news conference in London that year, then-IEA chief economist Fatih Birol, who is now the IEA executive director, told reporters that the U.S. would become the world\u2019s largest oil producer by 2017.\n\nSo, the U.S. is pretty much on track with IEA\u2019s projections from six years ago.\n\nAs we\u2019ve often noted when Barack Obama was president, the remarkable boom in U.S. oil production is chiefly the result of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing \u2014 not of any governmental policy.\n\n\u201cU.S. crude oil production has increased significantly over the past 10 years, driven mainly by production from tight rock formations using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing,\u201d the EIA said in April, estimating that fracking accounted for about half of U.S. crude oil production in 2016.\n\nThere are other ways to measure energy production, and, by some measures, the U.S. became the largest producer of key energy sources years before Trump took office.\n\nFor example, EIA last year said that the U.S. has been the No. 1 producer of petroleum since 2013 and the leading producer of natural gas since 2009.\n\nSo, the U.S. is on pace to become the No. 1 crude oil producer, as expected by the IEA since 2012. But it already had been the No. 1 producer of petroleum, which includes crude oil and petroleum products, such as gasoline.\n\nTrump also claimed that \u201cwe\u2019re now exporting energy for the first time.\u201d That\u2019s incorrect.\n\nThe EIA said in February that it expects the U.S. will be a net exporter by 2022 \u2014 a few years earlier than it had previously expected \u2014 \u201cprimarily driven by changes in petroleum and natural gas markets.\u201d\n\nWhen told about the EIA\u2019s projections, the White House said the president was talking about natural gas. It referred us to the House Energy and Commerce Committee blog that said the U.S. in 2017 was a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957. The committee blog cited the EIA.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t say natural gas, of course. But, even if he did, it is not the \u201cfirst time\u201d it has happened, and it was not unexpected.\n\nIn 2015, the EIA projected that the U.S. would be a net exporter of natural gas by 2017. That was the projection under EIA\u2019s \u201creference case,\u201d a most likely set of assumptions. The last time the U.S. was a net exporter of natural gas was in 1957, so Trump is wrong when he said that the U.S. \u201c[n]ever did it.\u201d\n\nAs he went around the table to praise his Cabinet, Trump also gave a wildly inaccurate figure for how much land the federal government owns.\n\nThe president joked that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is the \u201cworld\u2019s largest landlord.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody knows that. But you\u2019re the largest \u2014 by far, the largest landlord,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost half the United States if you think about it. Right?\u201d\n\nWrong. The Department of Interior controls less than 20 percent of land in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, about 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States,\u201d the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in a March 2017 report on federal land ownership. The bulk of that land is owned by the Departments of Interior, Agriculture and Defense.\n\nTable 2 of the CRS report shows that three agencies within the Department of Interior \u2014 the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service \u2014 control about 417 million acres, which would be 18.4 percent of land in the U.S. The Interior Department\u2019s most recent annual report puts the figure at 20 percent.", "lang": "en"}
