The post claims the road was funded by the Chinese and build as part of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's flagship infrastructure program. The claim is false and the road is not part of Duterte's official \"Build, Build, Build\" program.\n\nThe November 26, 2018 Facebook post contains multiple photographs showing a truck that has fallen through a road.\n\nThe post claims the road was constructed as part of Duterte\u2019s \u201cBuild Build Build\u201d program, which aims to help reduce poverty through infrastructure development.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe caption, when translated to English, says: \u201cBUILD BUILD BUILD. Father Digong's Build Build Build program is truly amazing, that's why the DDS are so amazed with it. When it's made in China, it's really something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at this newly-constructed road which was easily destroyed because it was thinly-paved. What can you say about Duterte's build build build program?\u201d\n\nDigong is Duterte\u2019s nickname. His supporters also refer to him as \u201cFather\u201d.\n\nA reverse image search found the photos in the post came from a November 24 report from Inquirer.net, a local news organization, about a truck that had sunk through a road in Quezon city, a Manila suburb.\n\nRegina Samson from the Quezon city government\u2019s communications center told AFP that the road was a local government project, not part of the Build, Build, Build program.\n\n\u201cA box culvert under the pavement collapsed when a 22-wheeler truck loaded with sand passed over it on November 24, 2018. The box culvert was constructed by the Department of Public Works and Highways way back in the 1970s, and 10 meters of it collapsed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is just a box culvert, it's part of the regular road-building program of any local government. Build Build Build is for major road projects,\" she added.\n\nAnna Mae Yu Lamentillo, chairwoman of the Build Build Build infrastructure program, told AFP that the road project in Quezon city was not part of Duterte\u2019s flagship infrastructure program.\n\n\u201cThe project is not part of the \u201cBuild Build Build\u201d program. It\u2019s not funded by China\u201d.\n\nThe official website of the \u201cBuild Build Build\u201d program does not list the pavement of the road in Quezon city as one of its projects. The projects can be seen here.\n\nThis map here also shows where the projects are located. There is no project in Quezon city.\n\nThe post has been shared by an anti-Duterte Facebook group with 14,055 followers.", "lang": "en"}
