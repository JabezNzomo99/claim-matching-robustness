In Northern Ireland it is the second highest on record. On this measure, the gap between disadvantaged pupils and advantaged pupils across the UK has narrowed in the last ten years, although it is unchanged in the last year.\n\nA disproportionate number of private school pupils go to Oxford\n\nAround 44% of young, undergraduate full-time students attending the University of Oxford in 2015/16 went to an independent school, according to the latest data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency.\n\nLooking at the third most selective universities in England, around 23% of state school pupils who took A levels or equivalent qualifications went to these in 2014/15, compared to 65% of pupils at independent schools.\n\nThis gap is the largest it has been since 2008/09 (as far back as these figures go). The gap is smaller looking just at pupils who took A levels.\n\nAcross the whole of England 7% of students were attending an independent school in January 2017. That\u2019s the same proportion as it\u2019s been since at least 2003.\n\nAn analysis of \u2018leading people\u2019 in the UK by the social mobility think tank the Sutton Trust found that private school pupils were disproportionately represented at the top of many of the UK\u2019s professions.\n\nIt found that in 2015 around three fifths of top doctors went to private school, almost three quarters of top military officers and top judges and around a third of UK educated FTSE 100 CEOs. Around half of the senior civil service and top journalists were privately educated. We\u2019ve looked more at these figures here.\n\nLooking at the latest intake of MPs following the June 2017 election the Sutton Trust also found that 29% were privately educated.\n\nThe proportion of disadvantaged young students going to university is increasing\n\nIn 2016 the proportion of 18 year-olds living in the most disadvantaged areas going to university increased for all countries in the UK. It increased to the highest on record in England (almost 20%), Wales (18%) and Scotland (11%). In Northern Ireland it was at 16%, the second highest recorded level.\n\nCompared to 2006, the gap between the proportions of disadvantaged and advantaged students going to university has narrowed across all four countries. In the past year, the gap has stayed broadly the same.\n\nScotland\u2019s figures shouldn\u2019t be directly compared to those from the rest of the UK because there is a substantial chunk of higher education provision in Scotland not included in these figures.\n\nFigures for 2017 will be published next week.\n\nDisadvantage here is measured according to the rate of participation in higher education by young people in each area of the country, so the most disadvantaged areas are those with the lowest rates of participation by young people. There are a number of other ways to measure disadvantage and we\u2019ve looked into them in more detail here.\n\nLooking at pupils in England receiving free school meals, an increasing proportion are going to university by age 19, according to figures from the Department for Education. An estimated 24% of English pupils receiving free school meals had gone to university by the time they were 19 in 2014/15\u2014the highest on record.\n\nThe gap between students not receiving free school meals and those who do has remained at around 17-18 percentage points over the last eight years, based on these figures.", "lang": "en"}
