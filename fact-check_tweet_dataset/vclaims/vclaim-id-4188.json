No, that's not exactly true. A website known for taking real bits of news from other sites and then adding a headline and a few paragraphs of unsupported facts to spice things up has been at it again. Their goal appears to be profit driven, it looks like they want to get people excited and angry enough to share and like the story so they make money from advertising.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on May 2, 2018 on YourNewsWire titled \"California Gov. Jerry Brown Outlaws Homelessness\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown has outlawed homelessness in Los Angeles, banning tens of thousands of vagrants from using cars and RVs as temporary shelter. Under cruel new laws, it is now illegal to sleep in a car or RV between 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Themindunleashed.com reports: Fines will range anywhere from $25 to $75 which is impossible to pay for most people in these situations.\n\nThe real part of this story is that the City of Los Angeles has some new regulations governing where people who want to sleep in their car or RV are allowed to park for the night:\n\nCalling this a ban on homelessness (or that it outlaws it completely) is quite a stretch although activists may describe it as such for rhetorical effect. But the city of Los Angeles is only a small part of the state of California and it is not up to the governor of the state to set parking policy for individual cities. So the connection with Jerry Brown is completely made up.\n\nThis isn't the first time YourNewsWire falsely claims Jerry Brown did something that was unconnected to him:\n\nFake News: California Gov.

The claim was made by a website that habitually takes some real news and then adds a few paragraphs and an inflammatory headline to make it sound much, much worse than what is really going on in order to get people to click and share the article on social media.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: North Korea Did NOT Agree To Open Its Doors To Christianity (Yet?)\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Calls On US Authorities To Disarm The Population\n\u2022 Fake News: Israel Did NOT Drop Tactical Nuclear Bomb On Syria\n\u2022 Fake News: 'Smallville' Star Did NOT Confess She Sold Children To Rothschilds And Clintons", "lang": "en"}
