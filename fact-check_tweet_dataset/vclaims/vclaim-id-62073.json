The woman in the photo is an Indian model. Also, no such incident was reported by credible sources from Pakistan.\n\nThe viral image is also superimposed with the screengrab of a tweet purportedly by \u201cAasia Zubair\u201d, where she explains the ordeals she faced at the school.\n\n\u201cSo Apparently I received a termination letter from my school administration stating that my body is too 'fit' or 'erotic' for me to teach classes of the secondary education students. We usually We wear decent shalwar kameez with dupatta at our school & I've no idea what else they wanted from me? Ridiculous #TooSexyToWorkSoFired,\u201d the purported tweet reads.\n\nThe archived versions of similar posts can be seen here, here and here.\n\nUsing reverse image search, we found that the viral picture was published by an online website called \u201cRepublic of Buzz\u201d on August 17, with an article on the same claim.\n\n\u201cHer name is Aasia Zubair. She is 30 years old married woman with two children and is working as a teacher since last 12 years. On Tuesday, 11th of August, 2020, she was fired from her position on the basis of being \u2018too sexy\u2019 to teach students of secondary education,\u201d reads a part of the article.\n\nHowever, we couldn\u2019t find any credible sources from Pakistan reporting the incident.\n\n\n\nAFWA reached out to Muhammad Rizwan Safdar, senior editor in the Pakistan bureau of Gulf News, who confirmed to us that no such incident was reported from Lahore. \u201cWe feel the article was a propaganda piece. No media in Lahore reported the incident,\u201d he said.\n\nA further search on the Internet revealed that the viral picture is of an Indian model named Zoya Shaikh. We found that the same image was uploaded on the Instagram profile of Zoya Shaikh on February 14.\n\nHer Instagram profile says she is an actor, fashion blogger and model.\n\nThis proves that the woman in the viral image is not someone called Aasia Zubair.\n\nWe further found a Twitter handle of one Aasia Zubair which was created recently, in June, and had only a few tweets. There was no such tweet as mentioned in the screengrab superimposed on the viral image.\n\nHowever, we found a mention of the \u201cRepublic of Buzz\u201d article in her twitter handle on August 19.\n\nHence, it is clear that an Indian model\u2019s picture was used to falsely claim that a school in Lahore suspended a teacher for being too curvy for her students. Also, no credible source reported such an incident from Lahore.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Netizens bake confusion over Tricolour cake, accuse Ankhi Das of insulting India\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Is pollution control certificate mandatory for motor insurance claim?", "lang": "en"}
