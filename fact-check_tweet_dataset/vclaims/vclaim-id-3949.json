They confiscated his original wwII helmet, canteen, first aid pouch belt, and suspenders. Has a huge history buff and captain America is his favorite. He put a ton of work into making sure his outfit was pretty darn perfect and authentic. If captain America is offensive to you you should probably leave America. #avengers #captainamerica #theworldtoday\n\nOn 8 February 2016, Facebook user \u201cKeli Marie\u201d published the above-reproduced image and comment to Facebook and Instagram. According to her post, her brother had dressed as Captain America for a school movie day during \u201cspirit week\u201d and \u201cwas harrassed so badly by the assistant principal over his \u2018offensive\u2019 costume and his motives for wearing it\u201d that he opted to leave school early.\n\nKeli Marie\u2019s comments omitted a number of crucial details about the specifics of her claim, such as when and where the incident occurred, what the purportedly \u201charassing\u201d actions of the assistant principal were, and the circumstances under which the depicted young man left campus without incurring penalties for cutting classes. Others users commenting on the photograph indicated that the school in question was Rondout Valley High School in Accord, New York and pointed out that school \u201cspirit week\u201d typically took place around the September/October timeframe, not February.\n\nThe post also provided no explanation about why a Captain America costume would have deemed \u201coffensive\u201d by the school\u2019s vice-principal (or anyone else), although some commenters inferred that a lack of patriotism was the source of the administrator\u2019s purported ire:\n\nAn IHeartRadio blog identified the young man in question as Rondout Valley High School senior Steven Snyder and provided a bit more information obtained from Snyder\u2019s sister. Among the details that were not included in the original, more popular, post were information about a violation of school rules involving contraband and a possible date for the incident (8 February 2016):\n\nWhat I know as of now is his assistant principal called him into the office and used a prior time involving WWII gear to harass himabout his attire Monday. We somewhat understand his belt being a problem, it was empty and though to the general public it just looks like cargo pockets it is a WWII surplus belt used for many things including ammunition so we understand it is weapon related. However there was no reason for taking his helmet (the best answer given was it was real metal and hard), suspenders, or canteen. He was also made to show/empty his pockets and show and explain the shirt under his jacket (an under armor captain America shirt). He\u2019s a senior and a good kid who really does embody the ideals of Captain America.\n\nThis statement shed a bit more light on the situation: the young man had apparently locked horns with administrators over the his \u201cWWII gear\u201d before, and the items confiscated evidently looked like weaponry.\n\nWe contacted Rondout Valley High School for additional information on the claim, and Superintendent Rosario Agostaro returned our call on 10 February 2016. Agostaro stated that he was well-acquainted with the student in question, repeatedly describing him as a \u201cgood kid\u201d and relaying information about instances in which Snyder behaved admirably.\n\nHowever, Agostaro told us that the district had received several threats during the 2015-2016 school year and as a result was forced to adopt a stringent policy with respect to weapons and ammunition. Agostaro said that the teen\u2019s costume wasn\u2019t of the modern Captain America type: it was a replica of a uniform used in World War II-era scenes in one of the Captain America films and included a replica ammunition belt that violated school policy concerning weapon-related items on school grounds.\n\nAs for the other parts of the costume, Agostaro said he was not sure what items were initially confiscated from Snyder, but he affirmed that all the student\u2019s possessions had been promptly returned to him. He also confirmed that no disciplinary measures were taken against Snyder (at the time of the incident or later); if Snyder left school during class hours, it wasn\u2019t because he was ordered to go home.\n\nSo while it might be fair to say that the teen\u2019s Captain America-related costume was deemed inappropriate school wear, it was not because any school administrators were offended by the Captain America character or the sense of patriotism he represents. The administrator involved with the issue described himself as a big Captain America fan and confirmed that the sole problem with Snyder\u2019s costume was its inclusion of a replica ammunition belt.", "lang": "en"}
