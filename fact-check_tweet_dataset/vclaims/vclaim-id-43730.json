He claimed that migration accounts for 80% of the population increase in the UK, amounting to one million people every three years.\n\nSince 2000 the UK population has increased by about 7.8 million. Of that, 4.6 million (60%) is the increase from net migration (the number of migrants coming to the UK, minus the number leaving). In recent years, it\u2019s amounted to around 900,000 every three years and it\u2019s been lower before that.\n\nThis is according to the best available figures, though these still carry some uncertainty.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the increase in net migration made up closer to 70% of the change in population. Net migration has not directly accounted for 80% of the population increase at any point recently.\n\nSo the figures mentioned by Sir Iain don\u2019t appear to refer to net migration alone. However they could refer to research which looks not just at the direct population increase due to migration, but the indirect increase from children born to immigrant parents as well.\n\nThis research puts the population increase due to migration at 82% of total population growth\u2014equivalent to roughly a million people every three years between 2001 and 2016.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, this higher figure shouldn\u2019t be taken as precise, as there isn\u2019t enough data available to reach an accurate estimate of the population of children born to immigrant parents.\n\nIt does, however, give an indication of the rough scale if you choose to include children in this way when talking about the impacts of migration.\n\nIn any case, given that there are a number of ways to look at these figures, it\u2019s unhelpful to describe this as the impact of \u201cmigration\u201d on population growth without any context of what\u2019s being counted.", "lang": "en"}
