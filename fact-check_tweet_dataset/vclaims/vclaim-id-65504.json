The claim is false; the video shows an assault at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Hong Kong.\n\nThe 17-second video was published here on Facebook on July 15, 2020. It has been viewed more than 10,000 times.\n\nThe video shows a man standing in front of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant counter. He begins verbally and physically assaulting the cashier behind the counter. The video carries the words: \u201cBugis junctions\u201d.\n\nBugis Junction refers to a development project in Bugis, an area in central Singapore.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201cThis was shared by a friend on an incident in Mcdonalds Bugis Junction Can someone who was thwr confirm the veracity of the attack I have posted this to the Mcdonalds Facebook page to ask if a Police report was made on this customer It disturbs me no end to see such abuse...\u201d\n\nThe video was also shared here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, McDonald\u2019s Singapore had some of its restaurants temporarily closed in April 2020 after several of its employees were infected with the disease. It reopened those restaurants in May 2020.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\nAfter viewing the video in the misleading post, a spokesperson for McDonald\u2019s Singapore told AFP by email on July 27, 2020: \u201c(W)e would like to confirm that the incident did not take place in the Singapore Bugis Junction McDonald\u2019s outlet, it took place in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the man can be heard challenging restaurant staff to call the police and cursing in Cantonese, which is one of the official languages of Hong Kong, along with English. It is not commonly spoken in Singapore.\n\nThe video was featured in this July 15, 2020, report by Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily about an altercation at a McDonald's restaurant in the city's Tuen Mun district.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the one published by Apple Daily (R):\n\nHong Kong's English-language daily newspaper South China Morning Post (SCMP) also reported on the incident in this July 16 report. The article\u2019s headline reads: \u201cCoronavirus: Hong Kong police arrest two suspected triad members in connection with assault on McDonald\u2019s manager over refusal to wear mask\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
