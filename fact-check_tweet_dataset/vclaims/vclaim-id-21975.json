This is true friendship. Don\u2019t scroll without sharing.\"\n\nThis post, which has indeed been shared more than 56,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nOther Facebook users were also moved to tears, but more in the spirit of the crying-while-laughing emoji.\n\n\"This is a fraternity thing,\" one user wrote in the comments, \"they ain\u2019t holding him up.\"\n\nThis claim has been around since at least December 2016, when the website Diply posted a story titled: \"People are so wrong about this viral photo showing \u2018paralyzed man\u2019 held up at wedding.\"\n\nIt says the bride posted the photo on Instagram that year. The account credited with the photo is now private, but Diply published two others that show the bride and groom standing, unassisted.\n\nAs AFP Fact Check notes, someone commenting on a similar Facebook post in 2016 wrote that the groom \"belongs to the fraternity Omega Psi Phi and this is a traditional marriage pose that symbolizes how your brothers will always be there to support you.\"\n\nWe didn\u2019t find any other examples of wedding photos like the one featured in the Facebook post, but we found several photos of the pose in different contexts searching for Omega Psi Phi Fraternity and line brothers. This Omega Psi Phi Pinterest page has multiple such images.", "lang": "en"}
