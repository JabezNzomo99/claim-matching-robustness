Chris Christie warns they\u2019ll become ravenous. \n\n \n\n That\u2019s why Christie told a crowd in New Hampshire they should vote on Nov. 6 for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State. Otherwise New Hampshire, which doesn\u2019t tax wages, may go the way of New Jersey.\n\n \n\n Christie said 35 years ago New Jersey also didn\u2019t have an income tax, but then \"Governor Brendan Byrne, a Democrat, said if you just give me a small income tax, just a little one, I will lower your property taxes, for the people who have the highest property taxes in America back in 1977. So 35 years later, what have we got? We still have the highest property taxes in America and the income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent -- 9 percent.\n\n \n\n \"Here's the key everybody: you let a liberal politician in the door and give them permission to give you a new tax, they only know one direction for that tax to go and that's up,\" Christie said at the Sept. 25 event.\n\n \n\n Did New Jersey\u2019s income tax more than quadruple since it was first enacted, as Christie said?\n\n \n\n The governor\u2019s statement is partially accurate because a group of individuals -- those earning more than $500,000 in taxable income -- are now subject to a statutory income tax rate of 8.97 percent.\n\n \n\n But those individuals represent only a small percentage of filers in New Jersey and the tax rates are lower for other income levels. \n\n \n\n The governor\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment, but the history of the state\u2019s income tax is clear.\n\n \n\n In 1976 -- during Byrne\u2019s first term -- the state passed a temporary income tax with two rates. \n\n \n\n A 2 percent rate was levied on income less than $20,000 or about $80,000 in today\u2019s dollars, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\n \n\n Income in excess of $20,000 was taxed at the top rate of 2.5 percent. \n\n \n\n A year after the temporary tax was enacted, the state made it permanent. \n\n \n\n Over time New Jersey modeled its income tax into a more progressive system, which now has rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent depending on income level and filing status.\n\n \n\n The state\u2019s top rate is 8.97 percent, which only applies to income in excess of $500,000. Less than 2 percent of taxable New Jersey resident returns in 2009 had that level of income, according to state Treasury Department data. \n\n \n\n An individual with taxable income between $75,000 and $500,000 pays a 6.37 percent rate on that income. For income between $40,000 and $75,000, the rate is about 5.5 percent.\n\n \n\n The lowest rates are 1.4 percent and 1.75 percent, which are lower than the state\u2019s rates in 1976. Those rates apply to incomes below $20,000 or between $20,000 and $35,000, respectively.\n\n \n\n So for Christie to suggest the income tax, in general, jumped from 2 percent to 9 percent is misleading. That\u2019s true for one income level, but the statement oversimplifies New Jersey\u2019s current income tax system.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n Christie said, \"The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.\"\n\n \n\n When the state first implemented an income tax in 1976, two rates existed -- 2 percent for income less than $20,000 and 2.5 percent for income more than $20,000 -- but the state has since introduced a more progressive tax system. \n\n \n\n New Jersey\u2019s top rate is nearly 9 percent now, but applies only to taxable income above $500,000.\n\n \n\n Every other income bracket is subject to a rate lower than 9 percent, with some income levels charged a rate of less than 2 percent. \n\n \n\n We rate this statement Half True.\n\n \n\n To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
