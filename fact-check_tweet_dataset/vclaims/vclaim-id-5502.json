Now, we\u2019ve taken a closer look at the research about what could happen with higher turnout, or even full turnout, and that too doesn\u2019t show that more voters would always lead to Democratic wins.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the data on past presidential elections.\n\nIn February, we looked at voter turnout for the voting age population, numbers available from the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. But one of the directors of that site, John T. Woolley, a political science professor at UC Santa Barbara, told us data on the voting eligible population (which would exclude those not able to vote, such as felons in many states and noncitizens) would be better for this topic.\n\nThe voting eligible population turnout rates don\u2019t show a clear pattern either in past presidential elections. Here are the lists of Democratic and Republican presidential wins and the voting eligible turnout rates back to 1972. (The data go back to 1789 on the United States Elections Project website, run by Michael P. McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida.)\n\nSince 1972 the highest turnout was 61.6 percent in 2008, when Democrat Barack Obama won. The lowest turnout, however, was also for a Democratic president, Bill Clinton\u2019s reelection in 1996. And the second-highest turnout was 60.1 percent in 2004, when President George W. Bush won reelection. The average turnout for Republican winners during this time was 55.45 percent, and the average for Democratic winners was 56.88 percent, a slight edge for the Democrats.\n\nExperts told us the overall voter turnout rate by itself wasn\u2019t that meaningful. Which party benefits from higher turnout depends on who and where the additional voters show up at the polls.\n\n\u201cMost often, higher turnout favors Democrats,\u201d McDonald told us in an email. \u201cGenerally, it is true that low propensity voters tend to prefer Democratic candidates. However, this is just a tendency: there are also people who prefer Republicans among these low propensity voters. Thus, depending on who shows up to vote, it is possible to have higher turnout and for Republican candidates to do better.\u201d\n\nWoolley said that \u201c[g]ross turnout is not as important as turnout in \u2018battleground\u2019 states.\u201d With an electoral college, drumming up higher turnout in a state that reliably votes Democratic, or Republican, anyway, wouldn\u2019t make a difference. \u201c[M]obilizing the base in California or, say, Kansas will affect aggregate turnout but have no particular consequences for the overall election result.\u201d\n\nEven in battleground states, higher turnout can favor one party over the other, depending on who exactly turns out to vote and how they choose to vote in that particular election. For instance, in Ohio, in 2008, Democrat Obama won the state with 66.9 percent of the voting eligible population voting for the highest office. That\u2019s the highest turnout in the presidential elections in the state since at least 2000 (as far back as the state data go on McDonald\u2019s Elections Project site). But, Republican Bush\u2019s win in 2004 nearly matched that high turnout, with 66.8 percent of the voting eligible population in Ohio casting votes for president. That\u2019s a mere snapshot of two elections in one state, but it shows that Sanders\u2019 claim of a Democratic win with high turnout is far from a given.\n\nHere\u2019s another example: In the presidential elections from 2000 through 2012, the lowest statewide turnout rate for the highest office for eligible voters in Florida was 55.9 percent in 2000, when Republican Bush won in what was a very close and contested vote. But in 2004, Florida\u2019s turnout rate jumped to 64.4 percent, and Bush still won. Obama won the state in 2008 with an even higher 66.1 percent, but again won in 2012 with a lower 62.8 percent.\n\nThe Sanders camp has pointed to surveys from the Pew Research Center that show that nonvoters tend to have more liberal views on some policy issues than voters (but not so much on social issues). Pew has also found that nonvoters have weaker partisan ties, but are still more likely to identify as Democrats than Republicans. In terms of demographics, the Pew research finds: \u201cNonvoters are younger, less educated and less affluent than are likely voters.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that if all of those nonvoters \u2014 or even more of them \u2014 voted, Democrats would necessarily win.\n\nIn 2003, three researchers from the University of California, Berkeley wrote in the American Journal of Political Science that it was \u201cconventional wisdom among journalists and politicians\u201d that \u201chigher turnout would benefit Democrats.\u201d The thinking goes that \u201csince nonvoters in America are drawn disproportionately from the poor, the working class, and ethnic minorities \u2014 groups that tend to support Democrats \u2014 higher turnout would produce more Democratic votes.\u201d But, they said, \u201cMuch empirical research, however, suggests that increased turnout would not necessarily benefit the Democrats.\u201d\n\nOne complicating factor is that nonvoters tend to have weaker party loyalty than voters, and, therefore, stronger inclinations to favor a candidate from a party other than the one with which they traditionally identify. That 2003 paper noted that back in 1980 James DeNardo, at the time an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University, had found that higher turnout would \u201ctend to benefit\u201d the political party that is in the minority in that \u201cparticular jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nThe Berkeley researchers \u2014 Jack Citrin, Eric Schickler and John Sides \u2014 calculated what the impact would have been on U.S. Senate races between 1994 and 1998 if there had been full voter turnout \u2014 that\u2019s if everyone voted \u2014 using Census Bureau and exit poll data. They found that \u201cin the majority of cases, nonvoters tend to be more Democratic, sometimes substantially so.\u201d But nonvoters\u2019 partisan leanings \u201cfluctuate significantly across states and over time, and there are instances in which nonvoters are actually more Republican than voters.\u201d\n\nWould full turnout have changed who won these Senate races? In tight races, yes, the increased turnout could have flipped the result. But the researchers found few of those \u2014 many races simply aren\u2019t that close \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t always the Democrat who came out the winner under these simulations.\n\nThey did find that with full turnout \u201cDemocrats typically do better,\u201d but the margins are small. \u201cThe Democratic candidate\u2019s percent of the vote increases by an average of 1.5 percentage points in 1994, 1.3 points in 1996, and .15 points in 1998,\u201d they wrote. That\u2019s why the close races could have a different outcome if everyone voted, but full turnout wouldn\u2019t make a difference if the election wasn\u2019t tight. Among the four Senate races between 1994 and 1998 for which the researchers found a change in outcome, three benefited the Democrat and one benefited the Republican.\n\nMore recently, in 2008, Citrin, Schickler and Sides modeled what full turnout would have meant for the 1992 through 2004 presidential elections in a paper titled \u201cIf Everyone Had Voted, Would Bubba and Dubya Have Won?\u201d published in the journal Presidential Studies Quarterly. The bottom line: Again, full turnout could have tipped the balance in very close elections, but wouldn\u2019t have made a difference in others.\n\n\u201cOur estimates suggest that there is a reasonably high probability that Al Gore and John Kerry would have won under universal turnout, but both elections still would have been extremely close,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis suggests that although universal turnout might well tip very close elections in the Democrats\u2019 favor, the electoral landscape would not be transformed. And, of course, the impact of higher but less than universal turnout would depend on which voters were mobilized in a particular contest.\u201d\n\nThat paper described the nonvoters as \u201cslightly more Democratic than voters,\u201d explaining that the difference in partisan leanings of voters versus nonvoters in some states was large, but in others, not so much.\n\nMore recently, in a March 2015 piece for the Washington Post, John Sides, now an associate political science professor at George Washington University, gave a rundown of the available literature on this topic. President Obama had suggested mandatory voting would make a difference, saying, \u201cThat would counteract [campaign] money more than anything. If everybody voted, then it would completely change the political map in this country.\u201d But Sides said, \u201cIf everyone voted, a lot would be the same.\u201d\n\nSides also noted that the differences between voters\u2019 and nonvoters\u2019 political leanings were typically small, and larger differences, such as those found in the 2012 Pew survey \u2014 the one cited by the Sanders camp \u2014 \u201care the exception, not the rule.\u201d In a subsequent piece for the Washington Post, Sides explained that calculations by Anthony Fowler at the University of Chicago, as well as Sides and his Berkeley colleagues, suggest that this gap between voters\u2019 and nonvoters\u2019 party identification \u201cmay be larger in 2010 and 2012 than in at least some earlier elections,\u201d though that gap may vary from state to state.\n\nMcDonald, of the Elections Project site, cited a growing \u201cage gap\u201d in the political preferences of the youth and the elderly in a 2011 piece for Huffington Post, with the youth being more liberal. A much smaller percentage of the youth vote in midterm elections than vote in presidential elections, McDonald wrote, so if they did turnout for the midterms in the same numbers, that could make a difference for Democrats. But only in razor-thin races: McDonald found Democratic candidates would have garnered an additional 1 percentage point of the vote in the 2010 midterms if the electorate had been like that of the 2008 presidential election.\n\nSides and his colleagues aren\u2019t the only researchers to have reached the conclusion that full turnout would alter very few election outcomes. For instance, Sides cites the work of Thomas L. Brunell of the University of Texas at Dallas and John Dinardo of the University of Michigan. Their November 2004 paper on the simulated outcome of full turnout in the 1952 through 2000 presidential elections concluded: \u201cHigher turnout in the form of compulsory voting would not radically change the partisan distribution of the vote.\u201d\n\nBrunell and Dinardo, whose paper was published in the journal Political Analysis, found that of the 13 elections analyzed, full turnout would produce \u201cno change in the eventual outcome of the election with two possible exceptions: 1980 and 2000.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found a \u201cgenerally small\u201d bias against Democrats in the range of 2 to 3 percentage points, \u201cwhich is usually insuf\ufb01cient to overturn a presidential election, in large part because most presidential elections are won by more than a percentage point or two.\u201d\n\nA couple of caveats: Higher turnout is different from full turnout. As we noted above, with higher turnout, which party would benefit would depend on which voters cast ballots \u2014 that is, where the higher turnout comes from. And as Sides notes in his Washington Post piece, compulsory voting could lead to changes in the behavior of candidates and parties, unknown factors that these universal vote simulations can\u2019t model.\n\nOverall, Sanders\u2019 blanket statement isn\u2019t supported by data or research on past presidential elections. Higher turnout could potentially tip an election to the Democratic candidate, but, the research shows, that would be the case in very close elections. And it depends on where and how the increased turnout votes.", "lang": "en"}
