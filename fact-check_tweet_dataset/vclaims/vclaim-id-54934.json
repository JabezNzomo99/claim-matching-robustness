Shared multiple times on Facebook since April 18, the hoax graphic uses a photo of Elago as backdrop. It is a photo posted on her official FB account in March 2019.\n\nIn an FB post, the party-list representative condemned the fake claim and called on the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate.\n\nShe clarified that the Kabataan Partylist is not against the lockdown or the enhanced community quarantine because \u201cthis is important to slow down the transmission of the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor [a lockdown] to be effective in the containment of the virus, mass testing and protection are needed...There should also be a proactive giving of emergency subsidy and other relief efforts as protection for hunger and other diseases,\u201d she added.\n\nThe fabricated quote card emerged after Elago released the Kabataan Partylist's statement in support of the Senate Resolution calling for the immediate resignation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque.\n\nThe fake quote has also appeared on an FB page containing the Philippine National Police's announcements. Another is a pro-Duterte page called Papa Pogi which had close to 300 shares and hundreds of reactions.", "lang": "en"}
