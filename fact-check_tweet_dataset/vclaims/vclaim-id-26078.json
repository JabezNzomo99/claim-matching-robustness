No, that's not true: it is all part of a fictional article made up by a satire site that tries to fool conservatives and Trump supporters into sharing ridiculously over the top false news so their fans can then mock them for it. It did not happen, it is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on August 8, 2018 titled \"Michigan \"Sharia Zone\" Immediately Bans Bacon, Requires Burkas in Public.\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nFollowing the recent decision by Michigan's 109th Congressional district to adopt adherence to Sharia Law as well as traditional Wypipo Law, County Commissioner Art Tubolls took to the podium to announce further plans : A full-scale ban on bacon within the district, and compulsory wearing of a burka by all females in public. Indeed, as expected, this news proved controversial. Dearborn's 200 billion dollar Allah Just'ava'nosh Mosque was surrounded by protesters, and the phone lines were jammed with angry potato pancakes. County Pastor Johnathan Regarp tried to calm the crowd down.\n\nFirst of all, there is no \"109th Congressional district\", not in Michigan nor anywhere else in the U.S. Michigan currently has only fourteen of them. There is no \"sharia zone\" either.\n\n\"Wypipo law\" is a slang term meaning \"white people law\". \"Art Tubbols\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\" (the owner of the site) and pastor \"Johnathan Regarp\" has a last name that is just the last name of John Prager (another writer of the site) in reverse.\n\nThere are several other hints the story is fake, for example the notice in the header that says \"Information you probably shouldn't trust\".\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about americaslastlineofdefense.org before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Van Full of Illegals NOT Caught Voting in Ohio Special Election\n\u2022 Fake News: BREAKING: Michael Cohen NOT Caught On Tape Colluding With Hillary Clinton\n\u2022 Fake News: CNN Did NOT Fire Jake Tapper For Assaulting Eric Trump\n\u2022 Fake News: Eric Trump Did NOT Get In A Fistfight With A CNN Anchor, NOBODY Went To Jail", "lang": "en"}
