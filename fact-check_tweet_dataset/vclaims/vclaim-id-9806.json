Nope, the porn star accusing President Trump of having an affair with her several years ago is not dead and so her death was definitely not ruled a suicide. That story appeared on a satire website seeking to mislead conservative and Republican people into sharing fake stories so they could be mocked for it online.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on March 29, 2018 on Daily World Update titled \"UPDATE: Stormy Daniels' Death Ruled A Suicide\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe Chief Medical Examiner at Bethesda Naval Hospital has determined that Penelope Withers, AKA Stormy Daniels, died of an intentional overdose. He has listed her cause of death as \"suicide.\" Daniels' lawyer, Michael Alvaretto, says he will continue the lawsuit for her daughter: \"My client was bullied into taking her own life. We'll be seeking $159 million in damages.\"\n\nFirst of all, Stormy Daniels' real name is not Penelope Withers, it is \"Stephanie Gregory Clifford\" and her lawyer is \"Michael Avenatti\", not \"Michael Alvaretto\". And there have been no reports from any reliable news sources about any suicide involving Stormy Daniels.\n\nWe wrote about dailyworldupdate.com and their hoaxes before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Stormy Daniels Did NOT Have An Affair With Bill Clinton\n\u2022 Fake News: White House Did NOT Release Proof That Stormy Daniels Is Lying\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as ladiesofliberty.net, shareotonin.com and dailyworldupdate.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
