A fact-check suggests the story was fabricated.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 26, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19871", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-taliban-isis-afghanistan-us/28510720.html", "vclaim": "The Russian Ministry statement, issued Tuesday, was headlined \u201cComment by the Information and Press Department on repeated accusations of Russian support for the Taliban.\u201d In fact, the statement contained little about Russia and the Taliban, apart from a complaint that \u201csome Afghan MPs and heads of provincial Afghan security agencies\u201d continue to make \u201cinsinuations\u201d about - and \u201caccusations\u201d against - Russia \u201cfor allegedly supporting the Taliban.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the \u201cinsinuations\u201d and \u201caccusations\u201d referred to in the statement are likely based on Russia\u2019s own actions and statements. For instance, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s envoy in Kabul, Zamir Kabulov, said in March that Russia views the Taliban as a \u201clegitimate\u201d party to conflict resolution because it is \u201cno longer pursuing jihad.\u201d\n\nIn its statement Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the police chief of Afghanistan\u2019s Kandahar province, Abdul Raziq, \u201calleged that Russia is helping the Taliban with money and arms supplies.\u201d\n\nRather than denying that accusation, the ministry detailed what it said was an article posted by an Afghan website called Payam Aftab, which claimed that American troops were arrested in Afghanistan while trying to sell weapons to \u201cIS commandos.\u201d\n\nThe ministry claimed the Afghan website reported that the three U.S. servicemen were subsequently \u201creleased from custody and transferred to their command, while all documents, including interrogation records, money and arms, mysteriously disappeared.\"\n\nPayam Aftab publishes in two languages: Persian and English. It is difficult to obtain information about the website, including who owns it and its editorial policy, since the \u201cAbout us\u201d section of the website is empty.\n\nApart from news reports, the website offers opinions and analyses, most of which are published under the byline of Sayyed Mohammad Baqer Mesbahzadeh. His analyses mainly feature anti-Western, anti-Israeli conspiracy theories. For example, one of his recent pieces was headlined: \u201cShia: The target of conspiracies of Imperialism, Zionism and Fascism.\u201d\n\nA person with that same name and a similar profile photograph on LinkedIn claims to be living in the United States, and identifies himself as the owner of the Payam Aftab news agency and the chief-editor of the website.\n\nAt the time of publication, Polygraph.info was unable to obtain a comment from Sayyed Mohammad Baqer Mesbahzadeh via the Payam Aftab website\u2019s \u201ccontact us\u201d form or via LinkedIn.\n\nAt the same time, the article referred to by the Russian Foreign Ministry was not among any of the articles posted on the Payam Aftab website, either in Persian or English. This means the article was either removed or never existed.\n\nMeanwhile, on May 24, a day after the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s statement, Payam Aftab posted a news report in Persian which was headlined: \u201cThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow\u2019s military support to the Taliban in Afghanistan is not true, but a group of American soldiers has been selling weapons to ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201dAccording to a Russian Foreign Ministry statement, three U.S. servicemen with arms and ammunitions, were arrested in the Kohistanat district of Sar-e-Pul province,\u201d Payam Aftab\u2019s Persian-language report continued. \u201cSome IS members who wanted to purchase arms from the three Americans were also arrested.\u201d\n\nPayam Aftab\u2019s Persian-language report made no mention of the fact that, just a day earlier, the Russian Foreign Ministry had cited the website as the source of the original report alleging that U.S. servicemen had tried to sell weapons to IS commanders.\n\n\u201cU.S. and Afghan officials remain silent on this matter and have not reacted to the reports,\u201d Payam Aftab\u2019s Persian-language report stated.\n\nPolygraph.info asked Afghan authorities for information about this alleged incident.\n\n\u201cAfghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Defense is not aware of any such accidents,\u201d ministry spokesman General Dawlat Waziri told the Voice of America\u2019s Afghan service. He dismissed the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s statement as baseless \u201crumors.\u201d\n\nIn his book \u201cNothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia,\u201d UK-based investigative journalist Peter Pomerantsev details the techniques used by the \u201cKremlin propaganda machine\u201d to \u201cfabricate alternative reality.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry statement, apparently based on a non-existing report by an obscure website, would seem to fit into Pomerantsev\u2019s description of a \u201cfabricated reality.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
