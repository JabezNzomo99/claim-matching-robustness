It is actually a line by Scottish writer J.M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan.\n\nA novelist, playwright and poet, Wilde was an influential proponent of aestheticism, an intellectual movement that considered beauty to be the primary purpose of art. Among his best known works are the 1895 satirical play \u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest\u201d and his 1891 philosophical novel \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d both considered literary classics. (RELATED: Did Mark Twain Pen This Quote On Kindness?)\n\nWilde often brought up the subject of youth in his writings. \u201cThe old believe everything; the middle-aged suspect everything; the young know everything,\u201d he wrote in 1894.\n\nHowever, he did not author the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The quote appears nowhere in his collected works. \u201cThis is said by a character called Earnest talking to another called Agatha, but not in a Wilde Play,\u201d Donald Mead, chairman of The Oscar Wilde Society, told The Daily Caller in an email. \u201cIt is from Act 1 of the J.M. Barrie play \u2018The Admirable Chrichton.'\u201d\n\nIndeed, the statement appears in Barrie\u2019s 1902 comedic play, published about two years after Wilde\u2019s death. Barrie is best known as the creator of the fictional character Peter Pan.", "lang": "en"}
