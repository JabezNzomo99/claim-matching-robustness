In reality, California Assembly Bill (A.B.) 2943 would not ban the sale of Bibles in that state.\n\nThe clip from Wheeler\u2019s interview with Allen can be viewed below. Here is a transcript of the most relevant section:\n\nWheeler: This is essentially criminalizing religious beliefs. And I don\u2019t mean to speak in hyperbole here, but if this bill were to pass, would this prohibit the sale of the Bible, that teaches these things about sexual morality? Allen: Well, literally, according to how this law is written, yes, it would. This is, you know, PC culture, politically correct culture, gone horribly awry. This is really directly hitting at our First Amendment rights as American citizens. Now the Democrat legislators in this building, right behind me, the California state legislature, they want to tell you how to think, what sort of books that you can read, write and purchase.\n\nCalifornia Assembly Bill 2943 does not mention the Bible, Christianity, or religion at all, so when Allen claimed that the legislation would \u201cliterally\u201d prohibit the sale of the Bible, he was stating something that is demonstrably and clearly false.\n\nIn reality the legislation, which was introduced in February 2018 by San Jose-based Democrat Evan Low, enhances California\u2019s already-existing prohibition on \u201csexual orientation change efforts\u201d (SOCE), commonly known as \u201cgay conversion therapy.\u201d In 2012, the California Assembly passed Senate Bill 1172, which banned mental health professionals from performing SOCE on children under the age of 18. The law defines SOCE as: \u201cany practices by mental health providers that seek to change an individual\u2019s sexual orientation. This includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\u201d\n\nA.B. 2943, as it stood on 20 April 2018, would extend that earlier prohibition in the following ways:\n\u2022 Prohibit SOCE from being performed on anyone, not only children under the age of 18\n\u2022 Prohibit the advertising or sale of SOCE as a service\n\nThe bill also appears to prohibit SOCE from being performed by any individual, not just by mental health providers, but the Assembly Judiciary Committee\u2019s analysis notes it is not clear whether the text of A.B. 2943 would amount to a blanket prohibition on any and all SOCE.\n\nAnthony Samson, a Sacramento attorney and policy advisor told us by email that the bill would prohibit conversion therapy \u201cas a commercial service in exchange for monetary compensation,\u201d adding: that \u201cIt does not apply to the sale of books or any other kind of goods, and it does not prevent anyone from speaking or writing on the subject of conversion therapy in any forum.\u201d\n\nLow\u2019s bill does not seek to outlaw all religious or moral instruction regarding sexuality and sexual orientation, nor would it ban the sale or possession of generic religious texts such as the Bible. Christian dogma might form the basis of efforts change a person\u2019s sexual orientation, but the Bible itself is not a \u201cgay conversion therapy\u201d manual.\n\nThe text of the legislation cites rafts of clinical evidence which conclude that SOCE is not a legitimate treatment because it seeks to \u201ctreat\u201d same-sex attraction (something that is not classified as a mental illness) and because it can cause harm to the patient.\n\nIn 2009, the American Psychological Association published the results of a major two-year task force review of peer-reviewed research about SOCE, which concluded by noting that \u201cEfforts to change sexual orientation are unlikely to be successful and involve some risk of harm, contrary to the claims of SOCE practitioners and advocates.\u201d The review recommended that mental health providers, faced with an individual who wants to change sexual orientation, should implement a therapy based on \u201cacceptance, support, and understanding\u201d but should not \u201c[impose] a specific sexual orientation identity outcome.\u201d\n\nIn April 2018, Low \u2014 who is openly gay \u2014 made an emotional speech before the California Assembly, recounting his own past struggle with his sexual orientation and describing the anxiety and even suicidal thoughts he had wrestled with:", "lang": "en"}
