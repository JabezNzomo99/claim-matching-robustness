The Justice Department and FBI also work in conjunction with state and local law enforcement as part of Joint Terrorism Task Forces.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet prompted wide debate \u2013 with critics questioning his authority to make such a designation and others claiming it really didn\u2019t matter, since there were plenty of laws that applied.\n\nIt also sparked debate about the nature of antifa \u2013 an \u201corganization\u201d with no leaders and members who often group in small cells with the shared goals of being disruptive and anti-authoritarian.\n\nAlthough thought of in the U.S. as a domestic group, antifa has members who identify with the cause worldwide. In Canada, antifa expanded as a movement against the far-right and white supremacy. \u201cAntifa is not a group,\u201d one member of the movement told the Jesuit Review in a 2018 article. \u201cIt is an objective.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., Trump and allies have tried to associate antifa with the radical left. Attorney General William Barr, in a pair of statements over the weekend, first said, \u201cIn many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchistic and far-left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,\u201d he added the next day, echoing Trump.\n\nNeither the Justice Department, the FBI nor the White House has provided direct evidence of that antifa incited any of the violence. Some reports have suggested right-wing groups could be involved. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, authorities identified a young white animal-rights activist as an alleged instigator.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, nobody really knows,\u201d Keith Ellison, Minnesota\u2019s Democratic attorney general said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s supporters say the Patriot Act, passed after the 9/11 terror attacks by al Qaida in New York City, Washington and Pennsylvania, defines domestic terrorism and could provide grounds to designate antifa a terrorist organization. The act states that:\n\nOthers argue that a designation is beside the point.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to designate a domestic insurrectionist group as a terrorist organization, because there is an extensive panoply of laws, at the state and federal level, by which such groups can be investigated, prosecuted, and otherwise thwarted,\u201d Andrew McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney wrote June 1 in the National Review.\n\nMcCarthy led the prosecution of perpetrators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, a case that played out before the 1996 law that allowed for designating foreign terror organizations.\n\n\u201cThe lack of a designation process did not matter a whit. Because the jihadists\u2019 plotting and attacks took place on U.S. soil, the full scope of U.S. law applied to all their activities,\u201d McCarthy wrote.\n\nA proposed amendment to the U.S. anti-terrorism law to specifically target antifa was proposed in 2018 but stalled in the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe issue surfaced again last year after a white supremacist gunned down 20 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. He left a manifesto complaining of a \u201cHispanic invasion.\u201d The president of the FBI Agents Association called on Congress to make domestic terrorism a crime to \u201censure that F.B.I. agents and prosecutors have the best tools to fight domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other rights groups have been suspicious of such a law and the potential for abuse. Even former prosecutor McCarthy says such a law could be problematic.\n\n\u201cSince we already have a slew of criminal laws for investigating terrorists, the only point of such a designation would be to permit the surveillance of Americans in the absence of probable cause that they have committed crimes,\u201d he wrote. Still, \u201cWe should absolutely treat Antifa as a terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critics noted that antifa can\u2019t really be described as an \u201corganization\u201d because it has no official leadership or hierarchy.\n\nA 2017 intelligence assessment by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI describes antifa as a network of coordinated cells organized for \u201cdomestic terrorist violence.\u201d\n\nHistorian Mark Bray of Rutgers University is author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.\" Writing in the Washington Post on Monday, June 1, Bray said Trump\u2019s characterizations of antifa \u201cintentionally misrepresent the anti-fascist movement in the interest of delegitimizing militant protest and deflecting attention away from the white supremacy and police brutality that the protests oppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut antifa itself,\u201d Bray wrote, \u201cis not an overarching organization with a chain of command, as Trump and his allies have been suggesting. Instead, largely anarchist and anti-authoritarian antifa groups share resources and information about far-right activity across regional and national borders through loosely knit networks and informal relationships of trust and solidarity.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that Bray, in an earlier Washington Post op-ed published in 2017, described antifa as \u201ca radical pan-leftist politics of social revolution applied to fighting the far right,\u201d whose adherents \u201care predominantly communists, socialists and anarchists who reject turning to the police or the state to halt the advance of white supremacy.\u201d\n\nWhatever the true nature of antifa, the Trump administration is blaming it for the wave of rioting in U.S. cities.\n\nAsked on CNN about the violence and property destruction, Trump\u2019s new national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said: \u201cThis is being driven by Antifa. Whatever they are, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re militants who are coming in and burning our cities, and we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday evening, Trump in the Rose Garden called on mayors and governors to use \u201coverwhelming law enforcement presence\u201d to put down violent protests. Shortly after, a phalanx of officers with shields and helmets fired rubber bullets and used tear gas to move peaceful protesters away from a church near the White House.\n\nTrump then walked to the church with Barr and other officials and posed for cameras while raising a Bible.", "lang": "en"}
