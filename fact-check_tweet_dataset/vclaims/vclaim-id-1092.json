While it is true that there have been consecutive nights of violent clashes in Dijon in the past week between gangs from the Chechen and North African immigrant communities, the city has not been surrendered.\n\nOn the day the article was published, Interior Security Minister Laurent Nunez tweeted that France's elite 'RAID' police unit had been mobilised in the field and that those engaging in the violence would \u201cnot go unpunished\u201d( here ).\n\nThe following day, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner tweeted that the state will never \u201cback down in the face of violence\u201d ( here ).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question of the Republic (the state) retreating from a single square metre of our country, including in the face of this extreme violence,\u201d Castaner says in the video embedded in the tweet.\n\nThe wording of the headline is also misleading in that it implies all of Dijon is now controlled by armed gangs.\n\nBut according to multiple media reports in English and French, the violence was concentrated in the suburb of Gresilles rather than the whole city, and calm had been restored by Wednesday (June 17) ( here , here , here , here , here )\n\nFalse headline: While there have been clashes involving immigrant populations, France has not \u201csurrendered\u201d Dijon to armed Algerian immigrants.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
