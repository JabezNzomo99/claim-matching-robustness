However, a mother, while giving birth, feels up to 57 DEL of pain which is equal to 20 bones getting fractured. The post has resurfaced and Vishvas News earlier investigated it and found that it is fake.\n\nA viral post shared on social media by a user named Steve Young Boot reads: A human body can bear only up to 45 \u201cDEL\u201d (unit) of pain,but A mother feels up to 57 DEL of pain while giving birth which is equal to 20 bones getting fractured at once. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nThe first claim suggests that a human can bear only upto 45 del (unit) of pain but a mother feels up to 57 DEL of pain while giving birth which is equal to 20 bones getting fractured.\n\nThe claim has been checked in its earlier post that can be checked here.\n\nSecondly, the unit Del does not exist. There is no unit called \u201cdel\u201d used to measure pain. Click here to read the fact check story.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Sorabh Garg who is a Pain Management Expert at Primus Super Speciality Hospital. He said: \u201cThere is no objective way of measuring pain. Pain is a subjective experience. Comparing different types and degrees of pain between different patients is not easy. One cannot realistically measure the pain. The actual severity is very personal. The post claiming that 57 DEL of pain in experience by a mother while giving birth is fake.\u201d\n\nWe also spoke to Dr. Anita Gupta, who is a gynecologist at Fortis La Femme. She also said that the claim is incorrect. Del is not a unit of pain. The intensity of pain varies from person to person.\n\nConclusion: Fake post determining the measurement of pain intensity resurfaces. The post claiming that a mother, while giving birth, feels up to 57 DEL of pain which is equal to 20 bones getting fractured is fake.", "lang": "en"}
