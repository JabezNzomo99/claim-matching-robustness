No, that's not true: The \"Lean On Me\" singer, who died on April 3, 2020, did not leave part of his estate to Trump's campaign. The claim is part of a satirical article published by a website that trolls Trump supporters. Other websites often steal such content and republish it without proper satire labels.\n\nThe satirical claim originated in an article published by Bustatroll.org on April 3, 2020, titled \"Bill Withers Leaves $2 Million Estate to Trump Re-election Campaign\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nOther, similar articles addressed by Lead Stories from the same satire network include:\n\nFake News: 'Bionic Man' Lee Majors NOT Dead At 83; $6 Million NOT Left To Trump 2020\n\nFake News: Clint Eastwood NOT Leaving His Estate To The Trump 2020 Campaign\n\nFake News: Rock Icon Mick Jagger NOT Dead, Did NOT Leave Billions For Border Wall\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact-checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact-checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this, he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.

Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer, it is, of course, also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes bustatroll.org as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
