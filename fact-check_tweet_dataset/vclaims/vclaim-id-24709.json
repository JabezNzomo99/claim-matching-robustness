The photo had the same frame features as the images of the said news outlet.\n\nAs of this writing, the photo has been shared randomly by both camps who support and oppose Biron.\n\nThe Gorriceta camp also denied the false claim through an official statement. According to them, the said claim was just \"black propaganda\", and that they honor their \"gentleman's agreement\" to support Biron as the next governor.\n\nThe Gorricetas also condemned the proliferation of the said photo, saying \u201cit is a clear motive of those who want to condition the people and malign the credibility of the Gorricetas.\u201d\n\nBiron and the Gorricetas are running under the Nacionalista Party, while Defensor Jr and Tupas III are running under the banner of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban). All these family names have for years secured a solid hold on the province\u2019s politics, especially after the 2016 elections.
