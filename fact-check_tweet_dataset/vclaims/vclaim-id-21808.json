That\u2019s about 11%.\n\nThere is no consensus on the definition of a \u2018migrant\u2019, as the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford has discussed.\n\nThe other way you could define a migrant is anyone born outside the UK. About one in six people in employment in 2016 were born outside the UK (using a different set of data from ONS). That\u2019s about 17%.\n\nThe ONS has said that of the rise in non-UK nationals working in the UK since 1997, \u201cthis increase\u2026reflects the admission of several new member states to the European Union\u201d.\n\nSince 2000, about three quarters of the increase in the number of non-UK citizens working in the country was accounted for by a rise in those from inside the EU.\n\nAlmost all of the increase since 2010 came from a rise in the number of foreign workers from inside the EU.\n\nIn the past we\u2019ve also looked at the evidence surrounding the impact of immigration on jobs and wages, welfare benefits, public finances, and local public services.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed the most recent immigration figures in our guide to EU immigration to the UK.", "lang": "en"}
