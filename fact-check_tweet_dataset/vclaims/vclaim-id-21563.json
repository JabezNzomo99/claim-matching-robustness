Part of Blunt\u2019s claim deals with how George Washington\u2019s Cabinet appointment process was the longest and the only one that took longer than Trump\u2019s. So we decided to start there.\n\nAfter counting the number of days between a president\u2019s first elected term inauguration and the date his Cabinet was in place, we found that Washington did in fact rank as the longest. Even though it only took the Senate a day to confirm most of Washington\u2019s nominations, there were still 149 days between the time he was inaugurated and the time his Cabinet was fully in place. Much of this had to do with the fact that the country and its government were so new.\n\nAfter Washington, Barack Obama had the second-longest Cabinet appointment process. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius was confirmed on April 28, 2009 \u2014 98 days after Obama was inaugurated. It took 42 days from the time Sebelius was nominated till the day she was confirmed. She was also just one of four Obama Cabinet members who took longer than the 19-day benchmark that was set by Blunt\u2019s claim.\n\nFollowing Obama, in the third spot was Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson became president in 1963 after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so for the purpose of this fact-check, we looked at Johnson\u2019s first elected term in 1965. His Cabinet took 64 days to be finalized, with the confirmation of Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. Fowler.\n\nNext is George H.W. Bush, with the fourth-longest Cabinet appointment process. It took 56 days for his Cabinet to be fully in place. Like Obama, four of his nominations also took 19 days or longer to be confirmed. However, one of Bush\u2019s appointments for Secretary of Defense, John G. Tower, was rejected by a 47-53 vote on March 9, 1989. Five days later, Bush nominated Dick Cheney, who was then confirmed on March 17, 1989, to complete his Cabinet.\n\n\"This is a process that is highly constrained by all the questions that have to be answered,\" Light said. \"We hear about all the delays that occur once a candidate is nominated, but we don\u2019t hear about the delays in between making the phone call and the official announcement.\"\n\nDuring this time frame, potential nominees are subjected to a questionnaire, as well as an ethics test. Light said that in recent years these questionnaires have become much denser.\n\nOnce someone is officially nominated, the process isn\u2019t just reserved to the Senate confirmation hearing. The FBI compiles a list of all potential problems with nominees. This happens by sending out students in the FBI Academy to speak with people who know the nominee, including neighbors. The FBI then compiles a report that is handed over to the Senate committee chairs.\n\nSo where does Trump fall in all of this? As of Feb. 8, when Blunt made his claim, six of Trump\u2019s nominees had been confirmed, with the last being Jeff Sessions for attorney general. However, the Cabinet confirmation process is still ongoing, so it\u2019s hard to tell exactly where Trump will fall when all is said and done. As of March 23, there are two nominees who have yet to be confirmed\u2014 Sonny Perdue for Secretary of Agriculture and Alexander Acosta for Secretary of Labor. But at 19 days into his term, Trump technically would fall behind Clinton, who took 50 days to have a complete Cabinet in place.", "lang": "en"}
