This is the spending increase between 2018/19 and 2023/24 in cash terms, but that\u2019s not the most meaningful way to look at it. In real terms it\u2019s a spending increase of \u00a320.5 billion and that\u2019s not a record level. There will be 50,000 more nurses going into the NHS. The government has committed to do this by 2024/25. Not all of these nurses will be \u2018new\u2019. The government have announced the end of hospital parking charges for patients. In December it was announced that hospitals in England will have to provide free car parking to frequent hospital visitors, blue badge holders and at certain times to staff and parents of child patients. The government will build 40 new hospitals. Six hospitals in England are getting the money to upgrade their buildings within the next five years. Up to 38 hospitals are getting money to develop plans for their hospitals between 2025 and 2030, but not to actually begin any building work. The government is putting 20,000 more police on the streets. The government has committed to do this. If this happens it will take the number of police in England and Wales to almost, but not quite the same level as it was at in 2010. The government gave the police much more use of Tasers to help deal with street crime. The Home Office announced police in England and Wales can bid for part of a fund to equip their force with more Tasers. Final funding allocations will be announced in February. The government are lifting the living wage by the biggest ever amount, up to \u00a38.72, and it will go up to \u00a310.50. The national living wage set by the government is set to rise to \u00a38.72 in April, the largest rise since it was put in place in 2016. It was also announced at last year\u2019s Conservative party conference that it would rise to \u00a310.50 within the next five years.\n\nThis week the Prime Minister took part in his first televised interview since winning the election in December, appearing on BBC Breakfast to be quizzed on everything from the royal family to social care.\n\nDuring the interview he made a number of claims which we have written about before, plus a few new ones.\n\nThe \u00a334 billion is the biggest spending increase if you don\u2019t account for inflation, but that\u2019s not the most meaningful way to look at the numbers.\n\nIn real terms (accounting for inflation) there will be a spending increase of \u00a320.5 billion between 2018/19 and 2023/24. The last time spending increased by at least that amount was between 2004/05 and 2009/10. We\u2019ve written more about this here.\n\nThese were the staffing pledges included in the Conservative manifesto and whether these claims are accurate will ultimately depend on whether the targets are met. The party promised to have 50,000 more nurses in the NHS in England by 2024/25, though these won\u2019t all be \u2018new\u2019 staff. We\u2019ve written more about that here.\n\nGP numbers in England have stayed at roughly the same level over the last few years, based on the latest comparable figures. Rougher figures show that the number of GPs per person in England has fallen since 2009. We\u2019ve written more about that here.\n\nIn December it was announced that hospitals in England \u201cwill be expected to provide free car parking to groups that may be frequent hospital visitors or those disproportionately impacted by daily or hourly charges for parking\u201d. This includes blue badge holders and people who frequently attend outpatient appointments. It was also announced that at certain times of day parents of sick children who need to stay in hospital overnight and staff working night shifts will also be offered free parking.\n\nThese changes are expected to happen from April 2020.\n\nIn October, the government announced plans to build \u201c40 new hospitals\u201d across England. But only six hospitals have actually been given the money to upgrade their buildings within the next five years. The rest will get money to develop plans for their hospitals between 2025 and 2030, but not to actually begin any building work yet. Many of these hospitals will be on existing hospital sites, so might not be what people consider to be brand new hospitals. We\u2019ve written more on this here.\n\nThe plan for 20 hospitals to be upgraded was announced in July last year and is a separate policy.\n\nThis was a pledge from the Conservative party announced before the election. As with the commitment to more nurses and GPs we don\u2019t know the accuracy of the claim yet as it depends on whether the target is met.\n\nAs we wrote in our fact check of the Conservative manifesto, this would return the number of police officers in England and Wales to almost, but not quite, the total in 2010.\n\nBut because the population has grown since 2010, recruiting another 20,000 full-time police officers would still leave the number per person 8% lower than it was in 2010, factoring in projected population increase and the government\u2019s recruitment timetable.\n\nThis week the Home Office announced that it would allow police in England and Wales to bid for part of a fund to equip their force with more Tasers. It says that final funding allocations will be announced in February.\n\nThe \u201cnational living wage\u201d (the government\u2019s minimum wage for anyone aged 25 and over) will rise from \u00a38.21 to \u00a38.72 in April. That\u2019s the largest increase (not adjusting for inflation) since the national living wage was put in place in 2016.\n\nThe increase between 2015 and 2016, when the higher national living wage was introduced, was about 7% not taking into account inflation. That was an increase of 50p. That\u2019s ever so slightly higher than the 2019 to 2020 increase, which will be about 6%, or an increase of 51p.\n\nAt the Conservative party conference last year the party also pledged to increase the wage to \u00a310.50 within the next five years.", "lang": "en"}
