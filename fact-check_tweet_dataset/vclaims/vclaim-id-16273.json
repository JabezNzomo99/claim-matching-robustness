But his comparison is fundamentally misleading\".\n\n\u201cRussia Today, TASS, Sputnik are all media under control of the Russian government,\u201d said Herbst, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. \u201cThey are tools by which the Kremlin puts out as \u2018news\u2019 messages that they wish to spread.\n\n\u201cCNN and the BBC and the New York Times are private news organizations not controlled by their governments,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the media assets of the Russian government are in fact far greater than those of Western governments.\u201d\n\nRussian scholar Nigel Inkster of the London-based Royal United Services Institute, told Polygraph.Info that: \u201cRussia has a global media presence and a propaganda and disinformation system that is operating at full throttle. But there are no Russian media that command the authority and credibility that their Western counterparts do.\u201d\n\nNicholas Redman, a Russian expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, told Polygraph.info that Putin is disingenuous by comparing Western free media to propaganda efforts.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that he regards CNN and the BBC as tools of the U.S. and UK governments respectively,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past few years, the Kremlin has reorganized the national media in order to achieve greater effect at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nCatherine Owen, a Russia specialist at the University of Exeter, said Putin may want to emulate the success of Western media \u2013 for his own propaganda gains.\n\n\u201cI do think there is a large and growing market for a non-Western perspective on international news events and I think that if the RT/Sputnik project is developed sensitively it will rapidly increase its audience.\u201d she said.", "lang": "en"}
