It\u2019s actually quite complicated, and neither member captured the nuances. So we dug into it, for the constituents who didn\u2019t get the full story at their town halls. Here\u2019s what\u2019s really going on.\n\nBut members and their staff members generally make too much money to qualify for subsidies in the exchanges, which were intended for people who previously did not get insurance from employers. So the Obama administration made an exception that allowed them to use the D.C. small-business exchange to receive health-care stipends from their employer (the federal government).\n\nOn the exchanges, members and staff members get an employer (i.e., taxpayer) contribution of 72 percent for their premiums. So this allowed them to receive a similar subsidy as they did under the federal health plan. Some members say they donate to charity an amount equivalent to the taxpayer-funded subsidy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there about where members receive their health insurance. Many people in our District, and across the U.S., think that members are on the federal health program, when instead they purchase their health care through the D.C. health exchange,\u201d Green said.\n\nWhen enrollment for Obamacare began, some members decided to go on their spouses\u2019 insurance plans or buy their own in the private market. In December 2013, The Washington Post compiled a list of members of Congress who signed up for Obamacare. The list shows that Mullin bought insurance from the private market and allowed his staff to get insurance from the D.C. exchange.\n\nAt the town hall, Mullin repeatedly said that he pays for his own insurance. That may be a reference to his insurance from the private market. But it\u2019s not accurate that members and staff members \u201cgo into the D.C. exchange and we personally have to pay for 100 percent of it. Not a percentage, all of it.\u201d And it\u2019s misleading to say that \u201cevery member of Congress, they pay for their own insurance, too\u201d \u2014 since they can receive a taxpayer-provided subsidy for insurance from the exchanges.\n\nMullin also repeatedly rebutted claims that taxpayers pay his salary, calling it \u201cbullcrap,\u201d and that he pays enough in taxes to make up for it. His spokeswoman, Amy Lawrence, told a local news outlet: \u201cThe congressman is referencing the federal taxes that he and his businesses have paid to the government over the years, prior to his being in office. Like all business owners, Congressman Mullin pays his taxes, which contribute to congressional salaries.\u201d\n\nOf course, unless he\u2019s donating all $174,000 of his congressional salary, this argument doesn\u2019t make much sense. And he has to earn a lot of outside income to personally pay that money back to the U.S. Treasury. In 2014, the House Ethics Committee found Mullin may have violated House ethics rules and federal laws by earning more than $600,000 in outside income. Yet his attorneys argued that the majority of that amount was through distributions from his family\u2019s plumbing business in Oklahoma and that his earned income did not exceed the $26,955 limit on outside income.\n\nGiven Republicans\u2019 push to repeal and replace Obamacare, it\u2019s only natural for their constituents to ask how their policy decisions will affect their own health insurance. Is their insurance funded by taxpayers? How similar is their insurance to their constituents\u2019? How will they be affected if Obamacare is replaced? Lawmakers owe their constituents an accurate and detailed explanation.\n\nNeither Grothman nor Mullin quite captured the complexities in their answers at their town halls. Grothman\u2019s spokeswoman said he was making a distinction between the federal health insurance program and the D.C. small-business exchange, because many of his constituents believe he\u2019s on the federal program. It would have been better for him to explain that in detail at the town hall, but we\u2019re glad to get a more nuanced explanation from his staff. We won\u2019t rate his claim.\n\nMullin, however, went too far by claiming that members and staffers pay 100 percent of their insurance from the D.C. exchanges. That\u2019s not accurate: They receive a taxpayer-funded subsidy for two-thirds of their premiums. And he misled his constituents by repeatedly asserting that taxpayers don\u2019t pay for his salary or his insurance, or his staffs\u2019 insurance. We award Mullin three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
