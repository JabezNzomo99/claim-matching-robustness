Not once, not twice, watch attentively at least thrice. Watch these people who are stuck in this epidemic. The police administration there have to face so many difficulties to catch them. Your heart will stop after you watch this.' (translated to English)\n\nThe video is alleged to show that the Chinese authorities are now resorting to capturing suspected COVID-19 patients using force.\n\nChinese Police are cracking down on suspected Coronavirus patients.\n\nThe video dates back to September 1, 2019. It was shot during the Hong Kong protests last year.\n\nIt has been uploaded on Youtube by the BBC News.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests in 2019 began in opposition to a proposed extradition law that would have allowed the transfer of fugitives to mainland China, among other jurisdictions.\n\nThe demonstrations have since escalated into a much wider and prolonged anti-government movement that has resulted in increasingly violent clashes between protesters and police across the city.\n\nTherefore, the viral video falsely claims that is a scene from a metro station in China.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Anti-CAA Protesters At Shaheen Bagh Refuse To Disperse Amid COVID-19 Advisory", "lang": "en"}
