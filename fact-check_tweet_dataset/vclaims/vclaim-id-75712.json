Dawson Hodgson, who is running against Kilmartin for attorney general, is criticizing the Democratic incumbent\u2019s actions in the case.\n\n\"When the press went to the parole board and said \u2018how can you let an animal like this loose,\u2019 they responded by saying, well, we never received an objection from the attorney general or from the victim\u2019s family,\u2019\" Hodgson, a North Kingstown Republican, said in a March 27 interview on the public-access TV show \"State of the State.\"\n\n\"Nobody was there to speak for somebody who couldn\u2019t speak for herself,\" Hodgson said.\n\nWe wondered whether Hodgson had his facts straight.\n\nIn June 1999, Brissette and Marc Girard, both 25, were arrested and charged with luring Jeannette Descoteaux from her hometown of Woonsocket to the woods of Burrillville where they beat her to death. Brissette hit her multiple times in the head with a lug wrench.\n\nGirard went to trial, was found guilty by a jury in 2001 and sentenced to life. Brissette pleaded no contest to second-degree murder in 2004 and was sentenced to serve 35 years in prison. (The sentence included the time he spent since being imprisoned at the Adult Correctional Institutions since 1999.)\n\nThe judge in the case, Judith Savage, excoriated Brissette, describing him as a thrill killer who simply wanted to see someone die.\n\nBrissette was initially granted parole in June 2012, with a projected release in December, but concerns about whether he could meet the conditions of the release prompted the board to delay his release until November 2013, about 14 years after he was first jailed.\n\nThe board cited Brissette\u2019s clean prison disciplinary record, and his participation in ACI rehabilitation programs and the programs set up to monitor and support him after release.\n\nWas Hodgson right that Kilmartin hadn\u2019t objected to Brissette\u2019s parole?\n\n\"That is correct,\" Kilmartin spokeswoman Amy Kempe said.\n\nThe Brissette parole exposed a flaw in the parole process that has since been corrected, Kempe said.\n\nAt the time, she said, the attorney general\u2019s office would get a list of inmates up for consideration, sometimes as few as 10 days or so before the board met. The prosecutors in the office would review the list to determine whether they should raise any objections.\n\nIf that list had two dozen or more names, the review could take time, she said. Brissette\u2019s case was 14 years old, and none of the prosecutors who worked on it were still employed by the department, so no one raised an objection, Kempe said.\n\nSince the Brissette case, Kempe said the attorney general\u2019s office now gets the parole lists a month or even two months ahead of time, which gives the office enough time to investigate each request.\n\nIt also gives the office staff time to prepare an argument for its position, Kempe said. That was important, she said, because if the attorney general\u2019s office simply opposed every parole request automatically, the office\u2019s objections would become commonplace and lose their credibility.\n\nParole Board Chairman Kenneth Walker declined to explain why the board approved Brissette\u2019s release other than to say the board has confidence in the program devised for him. He said the lack of a recommendation from the attorney general had no effect on the board\u2019s decision.\n\nDawson T. Hodgson said Attorney General Peter Kilmartin\u2019s office didn\u2019t oppose the parole request of convicted murderer Alfred Brissette.\n\nKilmartin\u2019s spokeswoman and the chairman of the parole board confirmed that was correct.", "lang": "en"}
