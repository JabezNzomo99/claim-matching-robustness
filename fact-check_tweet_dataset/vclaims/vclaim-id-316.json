Trump, with the text \u201cTIME \u2026 to go\u201d. This is photo has been manipulated and does not represent an actual TIME cover.\n\nExamples can be seen here and here .\n\nThe claim uses the title of the magazine \u201cTIME\u201d and adds \u201cto go\u201d underneath to communicate the idea that President Trump should leave office.\n\nA spokesperson for TIME confirmed to Reuters via email that the cover in the claim is not authentic.\n\nDelving further, there are giveaways that the cover in the claim has been altered. The cover is missing the date of the issue on the top right corner and the \u201ctime.com\u201d on the bottom right corner, making it inconsistent with typical TIME magazine covers. It does include the words \u201cdouble issue\u201d in the top left corner, which some TIME magazine editions have ( here ).\n\nIt is possible the cover in the claim could have been modified from an authentic cover with similar design, such as the one visible here .\n\nPresident Trump has been on the cover of TIME magazine many times, prior to and during his presidency. Reuters could not find the cover in the claim in the \u201cVault\u201d page on TIME magazine\u2019s website where most past covers can be seen ( time.com/vault/year/2020/ ).\n\nFalse. This cover featuring President Trump has been fabricated.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .", "lang": "en"}
