However, there still remains a chance of the tweet being removed by the media organisation.\n\nTo figure out the authenticity of the tweet, we checked it for any abnormalities. In the collage below, the tweet on the left is picked up from the official Twitter handle of Times of India. The tweet on the right is the one viral on social media. If you notice the sentence alignment and the placement of the TOI logo on the left tweet, they all fall in a straight line. Contrastingly, the alignment in the image on the right is botched-up.\n\nIt is, thus, clear that the viral tweet ascribed to Times of India was manufactured. Furthermore, as far as Flipkart is concerned, neither has the company put up any statement declaring the removal of Surf Excel from the site nor have any media organisation reported the same.\n\nSince HUL\u2019s advertisement portraying Hindu-Muslim communal harmony, several people on social media called for boycotting the company\u2019s products. However, there are no media reports stating that HUL faced heavy loses due to the backlash.", "lang": "en"}
