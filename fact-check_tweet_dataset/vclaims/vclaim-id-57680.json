It also claims that the valves cost approximately $11,000.\n\n\u201cItalians Found Way to 3-D Print Key Ventilator Piece for $1 to Help Battle Coronavirus,\u201d reads the main text, which is also the headline from a March 18 Common Dreams article. \u201cSo The Company is Threatening To Sue.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Video Show A Dolphin Swimming In A Venice Canal During The Coronavirus Pandemic?)\n\nThese claims, however, are not true. While Intersurgical did refuse Fracassi and Romaioli the patented schematics for the valve, the company did not threaten legal action. Romaioli confirmed in an interview with The Verge that there was no threat of a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI talked to an operator who told me he couldn\u2019t give me the files, but after that we didn\u2019t receive anything from the original company \u2014 so I can assure you we didn\u2019t get any threat,\u201d Romaioli told The Verge. \u201cThey said they couldn\u2019t give us the file because it\u2019s company property, but that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nIntersurgical Managing Director Charles Bellm also said in a statement to The Verge that the reports of threatened legal action were \u201ctotally incorrect.\u201d He debunked the claim that the valves cost $11,000, as well.\n\n\u201cJust to confirm that recent reports from Italy are totally incorrect, we were contacted at the end of last week for manufacturing details of a valve accessory but could not supply these due to medical manufacturing regulations, we have categorically not threatened to sue anyone involved,\u201d Bellm said. \u201cThe valve is an accessory supplied as part of a CPAP Hood system which alone costs a few euros.\u201d\n\nMassimo Temporelli, the physicist who recruited the pair to 3D print the valves, was quoted during an interview with Business Insider Italia as saying that the device maker threatened then with an infringement claim. The Facebook post\u2019s claim appears to have stemmed that comment.\n\nBut the physicist, who wasn\u2019t directly involved in Fracassi and Romaioli\u2019s call with Intersurgical, offered a different account in a later interview with The Verge, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s say the risk to be sued exists since they bypassed a patent, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nItaly has been hit hard by the new coronavirus, with more than 105,700 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 12,428 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map.", "lang": "en"}
