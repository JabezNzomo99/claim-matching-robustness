One can talk about the policies of the current authorities, but not about the country, not about the people,\u201d Putin said. He added: \u201cStrange as it may seem, even the state [Russian television] channels have an independent editorial policy.\u201d\n\nRossiya-1 TV host Olga Skabeyeva responded to Putin on her Telegram messaging service channel, saying that presenting Ukraine in a negative light had \u201cnever been done on purpose.\u201d\n\nOleksandra Tsekhanovska of the Ukraine Crisis Media Center told Polygraph.info a disproportionate amount of Russian state TV airtime is dedicated to Ukraine, the bulk of which is negative.\n\n\u201cAccording to our research, jointly performed with the Estonian Center of Eastern Partnership, approximately 1/3 of all news and political talk shows on Russian top-3 channels are dedicated to Ukraine,\u201d Tsekhanovska said, adding that 90% of the coverage has been \u201cnegative.\u201d\n\nTsekhanovska said those three channels -- Rossiya-1, Channel 1 and NTV -- are completely controlled by the Kremlin.\n\nCiting 2017 polling data compiled by the independent Levada Center, the Ukraine Crisis Media Center noted that 90% of Russians watch news on TV, with the three stations cited above accounting for 42% of the audience share.\n\nThe preponderance of news coverage focusing on Ukraine at the expense of domestic news events in Russia even sparked the \u201c#\u0447\u0451\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0445\u043b\u043e\u0432\u201d (\u201cwhat\u2019s going on with the Ukrainians\u201d) meme, in which the Ukrainians are labelled with a degrading term.\n\n\u201cAs a TV-host for one of the most popular programs on the governmentally-controlled channel with a carefully established agenda that includes systematic anti-Ukrainian rhetoric, Skabeyeva, without a doubt, knew exactly what she and her colleagues were doing and did it intentionally,\u201d Tsekhanovska said.\n\nHowever, Tsekhanovska said, admitting that reality would undermine Putin\u2019s argument that the media is not \u201cunder the Kremlin\u2019s control\u201d and \u201cthe illusion of freedom of speech in Russia.\u201d\n\nYevhen Fedchenko, director at the Kyiv-based Mohyla School of Journalism and co-founder of the Ukrainian fact-checking organization StopFake, told Polygraph.info his organization had worked for five years to provide a clear answer to Skabeyeva\u2019s statement, adding the anti-Ukrainian propaganda has been \u201cintentional, systemic and very extensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kremlin built the whole system of disinformation to discredit Ukraine and promote metanarratives that are used now,\u201d he said.\n\nFedchenko said mainstream media programs like Skabeyeva's talk show \u201c60 Minutes\u201d serve as an entry point for disinformation that is then \u201camplified by social media.\u201d\n\nStopFake conducted a wide-ranging quantitative analysis of 919 fake stories published about Ukraine from March 2014 to June 2017. The study demonstrated how those fake narratives about Ukraine were systematically pushed through the media ecosystem.\n\nThe study found that Russian TV, state news agencies and some ostensibly private media outlets were a significant source for disinformation, with Rossiya 24 putting out 48 fake stories, RT (38), LIFE (38), NTV (32), TASS (31), Lenta.ru (30), Channel 1 (25) and Komsomolskaya Pravda (20).\n\n\u201cIn general, analysis of the theme narratives of fake news stories demonstrates continuous attempts of Russian propaganda to construct an image of Ukraine as a failed state, by means of delegitimization of its armed forces, government and policies in different areas,\u201d the report stated.\n\n\u201cAnother key element for the construction of Ukraine\u2019s image, along with the failed state one, is to show Ukrainian society as such where the ultraright opinions and groups gain more weight.\u201d\n\nNotorious fakes include the 2014 Slovyansk crucifixion story, in which Channel 1 ran a false report claiming Ukrainian soldiers had crucified a three-year-old boy in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nTsekhanovska, who noted the \u201cvehement criticism\u201d directed at Ukrainian authorities on Russian TV, said the \u201cUkraine is a failed state narrative\u201d carried over into negative portrayals of the Ukrainian people, as well as their culture and history.\n\n\u201cUkrainians are constantly portrayed as Russophobic and fascist, their culture is ridiculed and negatively stereotyped and the idea is promoted that they are not a \u2018real\u2019 nation, as Ukraine is not an actual state but a \u2018business project\u2019 and \u2018a historic mistake\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nSkabeyeva herself has engaged in dismissive rhetoric regarding Ukraine.\n\nAfter The Law on Ensuring the Functioning of Ukrainian as the State Language went into effect on July 16, Skabeyeva wrote on her Telegram channel that Russian could only be spoken in everyday life and at church. She mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose first language is Russian, writing \u201che hired a [Ukrainian language] tutor one month ago\u201d and adding: \u201cWhat a laughable country.\u201d\n\nContrary to Skabeyeva\u2019s claim, Russian can still be used in kindergarten and elementary school; publishing, print and broadcast media; and cultural events, among other areas of life.\n\nSkabeyeva has said that several works by the Kyiv-born author Mikhail Bulgakov would look \u201cfunny and strange\u201d in the Ukrainian language.\n\nShe has also delivered reports under the title \u201cUkrainian Circus,\u201d often calling Ukrainians \u201cinsane\u201d and claiming the \u201cinsane\u201d were the \u201cface of their nation.\u201d\n\nTherefore, Polygraph.info finds Skabeyeva\u2019s claim that she has never intentionally reported on Ukraine in an unfavorable light to be false.", "lang": "en"}
