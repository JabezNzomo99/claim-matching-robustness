The viral video is being circulated across WhatsApp and social media platforms with the caption: \"China PM who told we'll translate the Quran as our own, realised that the only one way to protect from the Corona virus is doing 'sajtha' to Allah and went to mosque to pray, Masha Allah....\"\n\nThe caption also refers to recent reports that China would be rewriting the Bible and Quran to 'reflect their socialist ideology'.\n\nAcross Facebook it has amassed over thousands of views from different pages.

The video does not feature current Premier \u2013 Li Keqian \u2013 the prime minister of the Chinese government.\n\nBOOM analysed the keyframes of the video and scanned through archives of wire news agency Associated Press and found the video uploaded to their official channel in July 2015. \n\n\n\nThe description of the video reads, \"Pan Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi walks into mosque\". The video has also carried the story from the visit, \"On the second day of his five-day trip to China, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi visited Beijing's Nan Xia Po Mosque and took part in Friday prayers. The mosque is one of China's oldest, built around three hundred years ago during the Qing dynasty.\"\n\nAccording to other media reports, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the Prime Minister of Malaysia at the time, visited Beijing's Nan Xia Po Mosque to take part in Friday prayers on the second day of his trip.
