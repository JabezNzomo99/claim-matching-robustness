However, we found that this screenshot has been morphed", "author": "www.thequint.com", "date": "2020-06-10T14:37:56+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-45760", "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/lockdown-in-india-post-15-june-no-zee-news-screenshot-is-morphed-fact-check", "vclaim": "Despite several searches, we found no such news published by Zee News or any other established media outlet which spoke of a lockdown possibly being imposed all over India after 15 June. Further, we compared photos of Zee News\u2019 Breaking News bulletin and other templates and found no similarities with the screenshot in circulation. While the photo in circulation is maroon and white, Zee\u2019s templates are generally white and bright red. Some photos which we found on their Twitter handle and website can be seen below.\n\nWe have compiled several other breaking news templates of Zee News below, none of which look remotely like the screenshot in circulation. Not only were the colours different, the font used in the actual templates and the viral screenshot is also different.\n\nWe also found a template which was similar to the one which has been morphed. The \u201cBreaking News\u201d and \u201cSabse Pehle\u201d banner can be seen to be the same in both. The band at the bottom, red-white in colour, can also be seen to be the same from the sides. What is different is the actual text of the breaking news and that the morphed screenshot has a band with more text imposed on the lower band.\n\nFurther, we found that Zee News had also called out the screenshot as fake on their own website in an article. According to them, they have not shown any such news on their channel and said that the photo is completely fake and photoshopped.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that Zee News had not run any such news and the \u2018screenshot\u2019 is fake.", "lang": "en"}
