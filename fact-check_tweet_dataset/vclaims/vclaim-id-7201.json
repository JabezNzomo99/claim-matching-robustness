Over the years since then, there have, unfortunately, been other tragic events during which parents and educators turned to him for his calming and thoughtful insight. Fred Rogers\u2019 wisdom is timeless, and his messages continue to be valuable for children and the people who care for them, as we deal with the events of today\u2019s world. In times of community or world-wide crisis, it\u2019s easy to assume that young children don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. But one thing\u2019s for sure, children are very sensitive to how their parents feel. They\u2019re keenly aware of the expressions on their parents\u2019 faces and the tone of their voices. Children sense when their parents are really worried, whether they\u2019re watching the news or talking about it with others. No matter what children know about a crisis, it\u2019s especially scary for them to realize that their parents are scared. Even if we wanted to, it would be impossible to give our children all the reasons for such things as war, terrorists, abuse, murders, fires, hurricanes, and earthquakes. If they ask questions, our best answer may be to ask them, \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d If the answer is, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d then the simplest reply might be something like, \u201cI\u2019m sad about the news, and I\u2019m worried. But I love you, and I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d If we don\u2019t let children know it\u2019s okay to feel sad and scared, they may try to hide those feelings or think something is wrong with them whenever they do feel that way. They certainly don\u2019t need details of what\u2019s making us sad or scared, but if we can help them accept their own feelings as natural and normal, their feelings will be much more manageable for them. Fred Rogers often told this story about when he was a boy and would see scary things on the news: \u201cMy mother would say to me, \u2018Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.\u2019 To this day, especially in times of disaster, I remember my mother\u2019s words, and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers \u2014 so many caring people in this world.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis bit of autobiographical advice is something Fred Rogers was offering at least as far back as 1986, when he wrote in a syndicated\n\nI was spared from any great disasters when I was little, but there was plenty of news of them in newspapers and on the radio, and there were graphic images of them in newsreels. For me, as for all children, the world could have come to seem a scary place to live. But I felt secure with my parents, and they let me know that we were safely together whenever I showed concern about accounts of alarming events in the world. There was something else my mother did that I\u2019ve always remembered: \u201cAlways look for the helpers,\u201d she\u2019d tell me. \u201cThere\u2019s always someone who is trying to help.\u201d I did, and I came to see that the world is full of doctors and nurses, police and firemen, volunteers, neighbors and friends who are ready to jump in to help when things go wrong.", "lang": "en"}
