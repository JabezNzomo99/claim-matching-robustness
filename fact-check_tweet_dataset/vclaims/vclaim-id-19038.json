While the image on the top shows both the Indian flag and the flag of J&K hoisted on the building, the image on the bottom shows only the Indian flag. It attempts to suggest that the state flag has been removed from the civil secretariat building. Indian wrestler Geeta Phogat was among those who shared the images. Her tweet drew nearly 5,000 likes at the time of writing this article.\n\nFrom a Facebook page \u2018Modi Mania\u2019, the post received over 7,600 likes and 2,300 shares.\n\nAnother page \u2018\u0c39\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c26\u0c42 \u0c39\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c26\u0c41\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c35\u0c02 \u2013 Hindu Hindutvam\u2018 also shared the photographs. They have been circulated on Twitter as well.\n\nAlt News also received verification requests of the post on its mobile app.\n\nThe first clue which debunks the claim is that apart from the flags, nothing else in the images is different. This is most apparent by the placement of cars and the people walking around which is exactly the same in both photographs.\n\nA Google reverse-image search led us to a 2016 article in Kashmir News Observerwhich carried the same image.\n\nFurthermore, an August 4, 2019 report in Dainik Jagranpublished a recent image of the civil secretariat building where the state flag is visible.\n\nThe article also quoted BJP Kashmir spokesperson Altaf Thakur who dispelled the rumours.\n\nAn associate editor with ABP News Neeraj Rajput tweeted images of the civil secretariat building on August 4 where both the Indian flag and the J&K flag can be seen.\n\nSocial media rumours claiming that the Jammu and Kashmir flag has been removed from the civil secretariat building are thus being furthered using a photoshopped image.", "lang": "en"}
