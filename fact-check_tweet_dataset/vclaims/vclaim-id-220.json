The singer-songwriter was a fan of Donald Trump. In a December 2015 interview in The Guardian, Rogers said of the then presidential candidate: \u201cI really like him. I think his problem is that he says what everyone wants to hear, but he doesn\u2019t say it well. I love what he says, I have to admit. He can be president and not owe anybody anything; he\u2019s one of the few people has the money to do it, and has the guts to do it. You\u2019re biting off a lot by doing that. He believes everything he says: whether he\u2019s right or not, he says what everybody fears\u201d ( here ).\n\nIt is not true, however, that Kenny Rogers\u2019 widow donated half of his estate to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. The posts stem from an article on \u201cTaters Gonna Tate,\u201d a website with an \u2018About\u2019 section that reads: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe article itself ( here ) names Rogers\u2019 widow as \u201cDominique Tubolls Rogers\u201d; he was actually married to Wanda Miller ( here ) . The satirical item continues: \u201cRogers has already done more for the Trump campaign than most, offering free coleslaw to Trump campaign staff with the purchase of a half-chicken dinner at \u2018Roasters,\u2019 and allowing them to refill their drink cups for half price. Staffers sent Kenny a thank you note once, telling how much they appreciated the gesture, as Trump paid them minimum wage and made no promises for White House jobs, though many of them now hold deputy cabinet positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoasters\u201d refers to Kenny Rogers Roasters, a chicken restaurant chain founded in 1991 ( www.kennyrogersroasters.com/ ). As reported by Vice, the chain still operates in Thailand, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines (here).\n\nFalse. Kenny Rogers\u2019 wife did not donate half his estate to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign; this article was intended as satire.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
