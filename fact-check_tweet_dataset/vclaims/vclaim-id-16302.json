The Treasury has received \u00a32.4 billion in profit on assets owned by the Crown since 2007, which is more than six times the \u00a3369 million estimated cost of refitting Buckingham Palace over the next 10 years.\n\nThat said, the level of the monarchy\u2019s public funding is based on the profits of the Crown Estate. So by our calculations the Treasury\u2019s net profit, if you like, has been more like \u00a32.1 billion over the last decade. It's then down to the government to decide how it spends that money\u2014whether that be on Buckingham Palace or other priorities.\n\nThe government keeps most of the money from Crown assets\n\nThe Crown Estate is land and other assets owned by the British monarchy. It\u2019s not the Queen\u2019s personal property, though: she can\u2019t sell any of it. The Crown Estate comes with the job.\n\nWorth \u00a312.9 billion, the Crown Estate includes half of St James\u2019s in central London, various business parks and shopping centres around Great Britain, offshore wind farms, and 136,000 hectares of rural land.\n\nIt\u2019s managed by independent commissioners rather than by the monarchy or the government. They hand over the profit from rent and other income from the Crown Estate to the Treasury, as has been the case since 1760.\n\nThe Queen gets a sum equivalent to 15% of this in a \u2018Sovereign Grant\u2019 to spend on the royal family\u2019s official duties, such as visits abroad, staff salaries, and upkeep on palaces like Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.\n\nBut the government says that the cost of \u201cessential\u201d repair work needed on Buckingham Palace means that 15% isn\u2019t enough. So the Sovereign Grant is going to be increased to 25% of the profit on the Crown Estate\u2014meaning that, in effect, less will go to the Treasury for the next 10 years or so.\n\nCould Her Majesty pay for it herself?\n\nThat decision has given rise to a petition, signed at time of writing by over 140,000 people, demanding that the Royal Family pay for the repairs.\n\nThe Queen and her family do have private sources of income, separate from the Crown Estate lands.\n\nSince 1399, land and property in the Duchy of Lancaster has provided the monarch with a \u2018Privy Purse\u2019. This is income that can be spent on whatever the Queen wants, although the House of Commons Library says that some of it is spent on her official duties. In 2015, the Privy Purse came to \u00a316 million.\n\nThe Duchy of Lancaster is held in trust for the Queen, and there is significant government involvement and oversight of it. The same goes for the Duchy of Cornwall, which provided the Prince of Wales with over \u00a320 million in 2015.\n\nThe Queen also has the legal right to own private wealth like anyone else. And like most people, she doesn\u2019t feel the need to make public how much she\u2019s personally worth. So we don\u2019t know exactly how much she could in theory put towards repair work on Buckingham Palace, although Bloomberg and the Sunday Times have estimated her personal fortune at around \u00a3340 million.\n\nThe rationale for increasing the Sovereign Grant instead is that Buckingham Palace isn\u2019t just a place for the Queen to live. The government points to the economic value of the palace as a tourist attraction, and to the official events that take place there.\n\nThose signing the petition against this decision may view Buckingham Palace as more of a personal asset, and the Crown Estate as a public asset rather than the monarch\u2019s.", "lang": "en"}
