Carmond was accused of stabbing to death Charles and Melinda Smith, aged 61 and 59 respectively, at their home.\n\nAlthough as of this writing the story was more than a year old, it began to go viral again in early August 2019 for unknown reasons. However, casting undocumented persons as criminals is not uncommon for those holding anti-immigrant views, regardless of the factuality of such reports.\n\nWe checked with the Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and a spokeswoman for the department, which is leading the murder investigation, told us they had no indication that Carmond was an undocumented immigrant. As such, we rate the Crime Report story as \u201cFalse.\u201d\n\nThe DACA program allows immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to continue residing in the country so long as they meet a set of requirements, including that those who qualify cannot have been \u201cconvicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety,\u201d according U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nDACA has been a political football for the current presidential administration. President Donald Trump has been vocal about his desire to stem immigration from across the U.S.-Mexico border, and the administration\u2019s effort to end DACA will go before the U.S. Supreme Court in the coming months.", "lang": "en"}
