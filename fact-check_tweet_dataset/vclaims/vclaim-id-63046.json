Trump was responding to a reporter who asked how long the president expected to take hydroxychloroquine, a drug that Trump has been promoting as a potential treatment for COVID-19 without medical evidence for its safety or efficacy.\n\nHere is a transcription of the exchange between the reporter and Trump, per WhiteHouse.gov:\n\nQ Sir, how long do you expect take hydroxychloroquine? THE PRESIDENT: I think it\u2019s another day. I had a two-week regimen of hydroxychloroquine. And I\u2019ve taken it, I think, just about two weeks. I think it\u2019s another day. And I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still here. And I tested very positively in a \u2014 in another sense. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I tested positively toward negative, right? So, no, I tested perfectly this morning, meaning \u2014 meaning I tested negative. Q Have you taken the antibody test yet? THE PRESIDENT: But that\u2019s a way of saying it: positively toward the negative. Q Have you taken the antibody test yet, sir? THE PRESIDENT: No, I have not.\n\nBecause Trump did make the comment and it was reflected accurately by the tweet in question, we rate this claim \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
