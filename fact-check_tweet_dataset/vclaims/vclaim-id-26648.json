Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes worldnewsdailyreport.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
