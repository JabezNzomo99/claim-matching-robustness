Both the pictured person\u2019s face and the t-shirt design have been altered.\n\nThe original image was taken in the gift lounge at the MGM Grand Arena during the 48th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards on 7 April 2013 and showed musician George Strait holding a \u201cStraight Shootin Country Boy\u201d t-shirt. That photograph, available via Getty Images, was used as the basis to create several other promotional images of Straight holding up various t-shirts:\n\nSurprisingly, this image has also been doctored to sell products unrelated to George Straight related. In addition to changing the t-shirt design, some vendors also placed another person\u2019s face on Straight\u2019s body in order to sell a variety of merchandise. We found versions of this image featuring musician Willie Nelson, actor Kit Harington, President Donald Trump, and New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick:\n\nDoctoring an image to make it appear as if a celebrity is wearing (or endorsing) a clothing item is a common tactic amongst some t-shirt vendors. The doctored image of comedian Bill Murray and author Hunter S. Thompson wearing vulgar t-shirts, for instance, originated with a promotional campaign.\n\nIn this case, the doctored message on the shirt appears to counter the quarterback\u2019s actual beliefs about the \u201ctake a knee\u201d protests. Before the Packers game on 24 September 2017, Rodgers linked arms with his teammates to show solidarity during the national anthem. He also posted a photograph of himself and other players kneeling along with the hashtag #unity:", "lang": "en"}
