His firm was lobbying to have the system remain as it was, instead of moving to a system in which the federal government directly finances student loans. (The shift eventually was accomplished through passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, with no Republican support.) While this might well have influenced loan rates eventually, the firm\u2019s efforts were not focused on interest rates \u2014 they were focused on their client\u2019s interests. This is a fine but important distinction that the ad glosses over.\n\nThe funds Gillespie was \u201cgiving\u201d away were part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) created in 2008 by the Bush administration in consultation with both the Obama and McCain campaigns. According to the Politico article the ad references, Treasury officials were \u201cconvinced that the fate of the American financial system\u201d was on the line. Consequently, the White House made a coordinated effort across the political and ideological spectrum to ensure a meeting of chief executives from all the major banks went smoothly. Gillespie merits one mention in the article: an email recounting how he persuaded the conservative Heritage Foundation to not attack the TARP program.\n\nThe link Gillespie and the president create between Northam\u2019s vote, sanctuary cities and increases in crime is a scare tactic and, frankly, fearmongering. Northam\u2019s vote wasn\u2019t decisive. Even if it had been, it would have been irrelevant. Virginia doesn\u2019t currently have any sanctuary cities, and no Virginia cities seem to be moving immediately in that direction. And even if there were some sanctuary localities, there\u2019s currently no evidence that sanctuary policies are in any way connected to increases in crime, much less a rise in MS-13 specifically. Using imagery from outside the United States in an ad about American crime adds inauthenticity to the inaccuracy of this ad.", "lang": "en"}
