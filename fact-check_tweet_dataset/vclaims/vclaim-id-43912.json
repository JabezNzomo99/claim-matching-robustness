Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: NPR document needs to be submitted to withdraw money from the bank accounts. Fact: Central Bank of India has issued a clarification that any one document from the mentioned list (in the advertisement) can be submitted for the KYC verification. NPR document is not mandatory. Hence the claim that the NPR document is mandatory for the KYC verification in banks is MISLEADING.\n\nCentral Bank of India advertisement, mentioned in the post, can be found in the Eenadu newspaper published on 11th January 2019, published in Telangana. In the advertisement, it can be seen that the \u2018letter issued by the NPR authorities\u2019 has been included in the list of documents valid for the KYC verification. But, in the advertisement, it is not mentioned that all the documents in the list need to be submitted for the KYC verification.\n\n\n\nRBI (Reserve Bank of India) is the regulating-institution of banks in India. On its official website, it can be seen that it \u2018prescribes broad parameters of banking operations within which the country\u2019s banking and financial system functions\u2019. So, it is unlikely for the individual banks to come up with their own new rules.\n\nOn the official website of RBI, in the \u2018Master Direction \u2013 Know Your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016\u2019, it can be seen that \u2018letter issued by the National Population Register containing details of name and address\u2019 is included in the \u2018Officially Valid Document\u2019 (OVD) list. The \u2018Master Direction \u2013 Know Your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016\u2019 is regularly updated and recently, it has been updated on 9th January 2020. Even in the updated direction, there is no mention of mandatory submission of the NPR document for the KYC verification.\n\nOn the Government\u2019s website, Vikaspedia, more information regarding the KYC can be read. KYC is defined as the \u2018process by which banks obtain information about the identity and address of the customers. This process helps to ensure that banks\u2019 services are not misused. The KYC procedure is to be completed by the banks while opening accounts and also periodically update the same.\u2019 Even, on this website, the \u2018letter issued by the National Population Register containing details of name and address\u2019 is mentioned as OVD for the KYC verification, but not mentioned as mandatory.\n\nAs the advertisement by the Central Bank of India (on 11th January 2019) did not mention that only one among the list of OVD documents is needed for the KYC verification, there was a lot of confusion among the people regarding the NPR document. The Central Bank of India has published another advertisement with the clarification. In the clarification, published in Eenadu on 17th January 2020, it can be read that \u2018any 1 document\u2019 from the list of Officially Valid Documents need to be submitted for the KYC verification. Also, the same has been clarified by the Central Bank of India on Twitter. So, the NPR document is not mandatory if you can submit any other OVD for the KYC verification.\n\nTo sum it up, the NPR document is not mandatory for KYC in banks.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
