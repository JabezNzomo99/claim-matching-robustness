The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nFoxworthy is famous for his \"You might be a redneck if\u2026\" jokes, but searching online we couldn\u2019t find any credible evidence that he penned this list that touches on abortion, Muslims and federal debt.\n\nRather, we found users on web forums crediting someone named Fritz Edmunds with the list.\n\nSnopes, which fact-checked this claim back in 2013, also noted that \"the original compiler of this appears to be Fritz Edmunds, who posted it to his \u2018Politically True\u2019 blog back in Feb. 3, 2013 (albeit with a disclaimer noting that \u2018some of the ideas were from an email that did not contain a copyright\u2019).\"\n\nThe link to that post is now dead but the url includes the words \"channeling Jeff Foxworthy.\"", "lang": "en"}
