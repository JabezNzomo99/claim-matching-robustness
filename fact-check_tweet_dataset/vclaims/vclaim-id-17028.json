He used his opening remarks to criticize the race\u2019s frontrunner, Democratic California Attorney General Kamala Harris.\n\n\"The PPIC (Public Policy Institute of California) recently reported that Kamala is failing to keep us safe,\" Sundheim said May 10, 2016. \"There is a 34 percent increase in violent crime in the state of California. \u2026 And that\u2019s just within the last year.\"\n\nThe PPIC, a nonpartisan think tank, reported no such thing.\n\nWhat the PPIC said\n\nThe cited by Sundheim doesn\u2019t include final statewide violent crime data for 2015. It has preliminary statistics for January to June 2015 for 66 California cities covering about half of the state\u2019s population.\n\n, the co-author of the report and a research associate at the policy institute, told PolitiFact California that statewide crime statistics for 2015 won\u2019t be available until this summer.\n\nMoreoever, Sundheim misstated the preliminary data that the PPIC did have.\n\nThe authors of the report said 34 of the 66 California cities saw a double-digit percentage increase in violent crimes.\n\nThey never claimed that the state, or even the sample of cities, saw a 34 percent increase in violent crime.\n\n\"I have not seen any data showing a 34 percent increase in crime in California in 2015. He made a mistake,\" , the study\u2019s author and a senior fellow at PPIC, told PolitiFact California.\n\nThe most recent full-year crime stats, from 2014, put the state\u2019s violent crime rate at , according to the PPIC.\n\nA spokeswoman for Sundheim\u2019s campaign said, \"Looking at the study, the wording is vague and our researchers believed that the '34' was in reference to the percent rise in violent crime.\"\n\nSundheim said California\u2019s violent crime rate increased 34 percent over the past year, citing a recent report.\n\nSundheim misread the report in question, its authors said.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
