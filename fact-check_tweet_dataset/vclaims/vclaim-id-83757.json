It claims a German photographer used 16 cameras and waited 62 days to capture the shot. The image was actually created by a Kosovar fine art photographer using Photoshop.\n\nThis Facebook post, which has been shared more than one million times, says: \u201cA German photographer had fixed 16 cameras to get this shot for which he had to wait for 62 days. See the moon and sun together. This can be only seen again in 2035. Enjoy the shot.\u201d\n\nThe original photo was taken by Kosovan photographer Bess Hamiti and posted online in 2012. It shows the sun between the trees, no moon.\n\nHamiti told AFP that he had Photoshopped the image.\n\nThe metadata in the photo Hamiti posted in January 2017 on photosharing site 500px shows that it was edited.\n\n\u201cThis is Photoshop,\u201d Hamiti told AFP of the image shared in the Facebook post.\n\nIn this YouTube video from 2012, Hamiti demonstrates how the image was manipulated using Photoshop software.", "lang": "en"}
