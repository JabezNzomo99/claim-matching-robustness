The tweet appears to be fabricated. A representative from Walmart confirmed that the rumor is completely false.\n\nThe alleged tweet appears to reference a growing call among some activists to defund police departments. The \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement comes amid nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality after George Floyd died on May 25 while in Minneapolis police custody.\n\nSome looting and rioting has occurred alongside such peaceful protests, according to The Atlantic. Retailers such as Walmart, Target and Apple, as well as other businesses, in major U.S. cities have been affected by such actions, the Washington Post reported.\n\nThe tweet, purportedly from Walmart, appears to be fabricated. There is no record of Walmart tweeting the statement from its verified account. Had Walmart done so, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on it. Anne Hatfield, Walmart\u2019s Global Communications Director confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that \u201cthere is no truth to the rumor.\u201d\n\nThe background color behind the Twitter handle differs from that of the body of the tweet, further adding to its dubiousness.

However, none of these statements appear to contain any announcement to the effect of that in the fake tweet.\n\nWalmarts in the Chicago area that were looted are still being assessed for damage and \u201cno decision has been made\u201d regarding the reopening of impacted retail locations, a Walmart spokesperson told Business Insider.", "lang": "en"}
