The claim is false; the photo shows the group at a rally in 2017 to commemorate the 1986 revolution which toppled then dictator Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on May 13, 2019. It has been shared more than 400 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \u201cBlack is the new color of the Yellows and Otso Diretso looks like they're mourning now because they're having a hard time entering the top 12\u201d.\n\nThe photo shows members and officials of the Liberal party, the main opposition party in the Philippines, clad in black.\n\nSenators Risa Hontiveros, Franklin Drilon, Francis Pangilinan and former Philippine president Benigno Aquino are seen sitting at a table in the photo. Singer and Liberal Party supporter Jim Paredes can be seen talking to Aquino.\n\n\u201cYellows\u201d refer to the supporters and allies of the Liberal Party; yellow has been identified as their political colour.\n\nOtso Diretso refers to an alliance of political parties in the Philippines which lost to parties supporting President Rodrigo Duterte in May 2019 elections. Here is an AFP report about the polls.\n\nThe photo was also shared here on Facebook with an identical claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo shows the opposition party members attending a rally in 2017 to commemorate the 1986 People Power revolution, which removed Marcos from power.\n\nA reverse search on Google found the photo published in this tweet dated February 25, 2017 by DJ Yap, a reporter for local news site Inquirer.net: \n\n\n\nThe caption of the tweet states: \u201cNow here: former President Aquino, other Liberals, Senators Pangilinan, Drilon, Hontiveros of Akbayan\u201d.\n\nYap\u2019s tweets on that day reported on a protest held in commemoration of the 31st anniversary of the 1986 People Power revolution.\n\nNational news site GMA News tweeted a similar photo of the opposition politicians at the event here on February 25, 2017:\n\nThis AFP report published on February 25, 2017 gives more details on the protest.\n\nTwo of of Yap's other tweets from the same event, this one and this one, are shown below:", "lang": "en"}
