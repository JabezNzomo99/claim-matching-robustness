The others have not.\"\n\nBut former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee signed the same \"no new taxes\" pledge in March. So too have Sam Brownback, Duncan Hunter, Tom Tancredo and Ron Paul \u2013 all Republicans vying for president.\n\nOn a base level, then, Romney's ad is incorrect.\n\nBut he did say he's the \"only major candidate.\" And among the pledge signers, Romney is certainly the top candidate. So the ad's truthfulness comes down to the definition of \"major.\"\n\nHuckabee, who has been feeling momentum after standout debate performances and a second place finish in the Iowa straw poll, views himself as a major candidate (don't they all?) and his campaign was quick to challenge the radio spot.\n\n\"There was no slight intended. The context was in line with comparisons between the top tier candidates in terms of fundraising and current poll numbers,\" Romney spokeswoman Gail Gitcho said.\n\nThe Presidential Taxpayer Protection Pledge was started in 1987 by Americans For Tax Reform, a group headed by national conservative figure Grover Norquist. Every Republican candidate since 1988 has signed the pledge, according to the group.\n\nBut so far in the 2008 contest, other top GOP presidential contenders have not, including Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson and John McCain.\n\nRomney has opposed a pledge in the past. In 2002, while running for governor of Massachusetts, he said he opposed all tax increases in principle but was not willing to put that in writing. His spokesman at the time called such pledges \"government by gimmickry.\"", "lang": "en"}
