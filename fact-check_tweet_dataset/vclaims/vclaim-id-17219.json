Additionally, Russia's economic growth during that period averaged 0.97% per year, according to the IMF, while Rosstat says it grew 0.91% per year. In any case, both estimates indicate that Russia\u2019s economy grew \u201cless than 1% per year,\u201d as Kudrin noted in his interview.\n\nFor a comparative chart, we took data on Russia from Rosstat, while using IMF data for the world average, including the fund\u2019s latest forecasts for the period up to 2024:\n\nThe IMF predicts the world economy will grow by 3.6-3.7% in 2023-2024, while the economies of developed countries will grow by just 1.6% during the same period. The Russian Ministry of Economic Development predicts that Russia\u2019s economy will grow by 3.3% in 2023-2024, while the IMF predicts the Russian economy\u2019s growth rate in that period will match that of world\u2019s developed economies \u2013 1.6 percent:\n\nStill, the IMF predicts that by the middle of the next decade, Russia\u2019s economic growth rate will be the lowest among the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China):\n\nHowever, if we proceed from the Russian Ministry of Economic Development\u2019s current forecasts and compare them with those of the IMF, Russia\u2019s economic growth rate by the middle of next decade will be in third place among the BRICS countries, behind India and China.", "lang": "en"}
