{"title": "Income tax cuts for basic rate payers", "subtitle": "Increases to the income tax personal allowance have taken millions out of income tax, although those on low incomes have been hit elsewhere.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-20903", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/income-tax-cuts-basic-rate-payers/", "vclaim": "It\u2019s correct that millions of people now aren\u2019t paying income tax when they otherwise would have been, due to increases in the income tax personal allowance, which we\u2019ve summarised before. But this doesn\u2019t mean all those people are taking home more money, due to wider changes to taxes and benefits.\n\nAccording to government estimates, around an extra four million people have not had to pay income tax since 2010/11 due to an increase in the personal allowance, which is the amount that can be earned before tax has to be paid. This is currently \u00a311,500, an increase from \u00a36,475 in 2010/11.\n\nThe 2016 spring budget said \u201ca typical basic rate taxpayer will pay over \u00a31,000 less income tax in 2017-18 than in 2010-11\u201d. Similar claims have been made in previous years. We\u2019ve asked the Treasury for the analysis that the latest claim is based on.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that those paying less due to income tax changes are taking home more money. The Institute for Fiscal Studies found that when including changes to other taxes and benefits such as VAT and child tax credits, changes have led to \u201csignificant reductions in household income\u201d for low-income households between 2010 and 2015.", "lang": "en"}
