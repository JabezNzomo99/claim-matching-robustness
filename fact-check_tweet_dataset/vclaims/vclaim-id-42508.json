No, this is not true: Hanks, who was being treated after contracting the novel coronavirus, was not arrested for pedophilia and being held in a hotel room in Australia as claimed as part of the QAnon conspiracy theory that Hanks and others are pedophiles or financial criminals being round up for alleged roles in international child sex-trafficking or schemes to dominate the globe..\n\nThe claim appeared as a post (archived here) published to Facebook by Juha Sawkat on March 15, 2020, under the title \"Please Read And Start Opening Your Eyes\". It opened:\n\nThis story is not true.\n\nHanks was diagnosed with coronavirus while filming a movie in Australia. He and his wife, Rita Wilson, were in the hospital for five days. They were then released and were recovering together. He was never arrested for pedophilia.\n\nShawkat also posted a screenshot of the alleged reports with the message:\n\nThe screenshot of the message from Facebook user Daniel Robert Dowell does not seem to exist on Facebook.\n\nAs the story went viral, Tom Hanks was posting on his Instagram account about his quarantine on March 17, 2020, two days after the Facebook post about his arrest.\n\nThe group QAnon seems to have started the fake story and included both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and television mogul Oprah Winfrey in the conspiracy.\n\nThe Washington Post called out the story on March 18, 2020, calling it an \"unhinged conspiracy theory,\" after Winfrey's name started trending on Twitter in connection with a supposed arrest.\n\nLate Tuesday night, as results trickled in from Democratic primary elections and the number of people infected by the novel coronavirus continued to climb, Oprah Winfrey's name began trending on Twitter. An unhinged conspiracy theory had taken root, claiming that she was arrested for her role in a global sex trafficking ring. It reached a point where Winfrey felt compelled to address the rumors, which quickly spread across the Internet as people bored and trapped at home searched for some form of entertainment.\n\nWinfrey Tweeted a response to the rumor late on March 17, 2020:\n\nThe claim became popular with QAnon followers, with more details about other fake arrests and legal actions that did not go as viral.\n\nOne of the pieces shared claimed this about Trudeau:\n\nTwitter user Travis View wrote about using coronavirus being used to cover for the supposed conspiracy.\n\nHere is The Washington Post's explainer video on QAnon:\n\nTwitter user Respectable Lawyer posted he had tracked down the man who posted the original story about Oprah's house getting raided, noting it looked like a $30,000 bungalow in West Detroit - not any of Winfrey's mansions.\n\nHanks has been a constant target of QAnon, the far right-wing conspiracy group that claims he and others send secret messages through social media and other means that refer to pedophilia and child sex-trafficking.\n\nIn addition to targeting Hanks and Winfrey, the conspiracy claimed that Italy and the United Arab Emirates were two other countries where mass arrests and criminal indictments were served on pedophiles and child sex-traffickers.\n\nNone of this is true.", "lang": "en"}
