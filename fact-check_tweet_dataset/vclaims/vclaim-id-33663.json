On top of this, the methods the Conservatives used to reach this number are not credible.\n\nBack in September, the Labour conference approved a proposal to \u201cmaintain and extend free movement rights\u201d. As we said at the time, this does not make it official party policy. We don\u2019t know what will be adopted in Labour\u2019s manifesto, or how an immigration policy to extend free movement would be implemented in practice.\n\nShadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott was quoted at the time saying Labour\u2019s conference motion would become part of the party\u2019s plans for government, though in an interview with the BBC this week, Jeremy Corbyn signalled the priority was to secure free movement \u201cfor those that have legitimate settled status in the UK, that is family reunion\u201d.\n\nHe also said that the case of free movement already enjoyed by EU citizens \u201cdepends on the ultimate outcome of the EU [Brexit] negotiations\u201d Labour wants to undertake if it wins the election.\n\nThe research behind this figure is not credible\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 figure refers to \u201cnet migration\u201d\u2014how many more people immigrate to the UK in a year than emigrate out\u2014rather than immigration. Net migration is currently estimated at 226,000 a year, but it\u2019s a somewhat uncertain figure and work is ongoing to improve those estimates.\n\nThe Conservatives have published a paper setting out the methods behind their calculation.\n\nThe methodology makes extreme assumptions about both what Labour\u2019s policy would be and the consequences of it.\n\nThe core assumptions behind it are that Labour wants to extend complete freedom of movement to the entire world, and that the resulting level of immigration from this policy is based off historical comparisons with what happened in 2004 and 2013, when a number of central and eastern European countries gained full free movement rights within the EU.\n\nThe Conservatives say that for \u201cshort-haul\u201d countries just outside of Europe, immigration to the UK would increase the UK population at a similar scale as the historical average for new EU members. For \u201clong haul\u201d countries further afield, they\u2019ve used the EU country with the smallest impact on the UK population in the years they\u2019ve analysed\u2014Hungary.\n\nSo in essence, this assumes that if the UK allowed global free movement, the impact on the UK population would be the same proportion as Hungary had in the five years from 2004. Estimates suggest the Hungarian-born population in the UK rose by roughly 80% over that period.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest this assumption is realistic.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t acknowledge a range of other factors that will play a part in determining levels of future immigration to the UK, like countries\u2019 relative economic strength, language and cultural connections, and other aspects of migration policy.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that extending free movement (currently only available to EU nationals while the UK remains an EU member) in isolation would lead to increased immigration compared to the status quo. But again, we won\u2019t know to what extent that is an accurate representation of Labour policy until their manifesto is out.", "lang": "en"}
