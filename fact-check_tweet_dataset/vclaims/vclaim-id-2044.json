The ship, which was supposed to be carrying \u201cemergency supplies,\u201d was actually carrying a cargo that had authorities stunned. BPA Harbormaster Jake Cummings explained to CNN: \u201cWe received a tip that the Clinton Foundation flagship, The Chelsea, was carrying illegal contraband into the United States. We honestly didn\u2019t know what to expect, but what we found was simply\u2026surreal. In the middle of the ship\u2019s large manifest of containers, most of which were empty, we found 14 containing\u2026people. Yes, people. They were all Refugees from places like Yemen and Syria and not a single one had any kind of documentation. We interviewed those who spoke English and were told that for $40K, anyone can catch a ride to the United States on a ship nobody would ever suspect.\u201d\n\nThe article continues with a list of more illegal items allegedly discovered aboard \u201cthe Chelsea\u201d:\n\nTwo other containers were also found to contain multiple crates of contraband, including illegal fruits that could potentially carry foreign insects and foodborne illnesses, weapons without serial numbers on them and no less than 30 pounds of marijuana. Several of the refugees were also found to be in possession of black tar heroin, an addictive, smokable form of the drug.\n\nWithout exception, all the above claims were fabricated, however. No such raid was reported in any legitimate news sources. CNN, specifically, did not run an interview with the Port of Baltimore harbor master in connection with this or any similar raid. We have found no evidence that the Clinton Foundation owns or operates any kind of cargo ship called \u201cthe Chelsea.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the article originated on a web site known as The Last Line of Defense (about which we have written many times), a \u201csatirical\u201d venue that cranks out false clickbait stories on a daily basis. As the site\u2019s administrators note on in a disclaimer on their \u201cAbout Us\u201d page:\n\nThe Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real.", "lang": "en"}
