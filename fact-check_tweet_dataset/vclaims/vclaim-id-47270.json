Netizens have widely condemned the video.\n\nA twitter user has attributed the content of the video to blind hatred towards Hinduism. The tweet has more than 80 thousand views.\n\nIn another tweet, a user wrote that the whole incident is shocking and asked how the CAA is related to Hindus.\n\nThis tweet was shared by Sambit Patra, BJP spokesperson, who wrote, \"This video is shocking \u2026how can any protest have a right to defile the tenets of Hinduism ..who gives them the right to burn the pictures of Hindu Gods & Goddesses ..why should any protest be an Anti-Hindu protest?? Is this is what the Congress & Communists promote?? #Shame\"\n\nHis tweet went viral all over twitter.\n\nPictures of Hindu gods set ablaze by Anti-CAA protestors at a rally.\n\nAn Old video falsely linked to Anti-CAA protests\n\nThe people in the clip can be heard chanting slogans in Kannada. At the 58-second mark in the video, one can hear the protestors chant, \"Zindabad, Zindabad! Ambedkar Zindabad!\"\n\nOn August 14, 2018, a Facebook user posted a longer version of this video and wrote: \"Young Ambedkarites burning portraits of Hindu Gods in Ashokpuram MYSORE to protest against Sanghis who burned copies of the Constitution\".\n\nOn comparing the two videos, it became evident that these two were identical.\n\nSince the original video was posted more than a year ago, it cannot be a part of the Anti-CAA protests, which started in December 2019 and is still continuing. Therefore we can ascertain that the video is not from an Anti-CAA rally.\n\nAlso read: UP Police Sends Notice To Man Who Died 6 Years Ago For Causing Violence During Anti CAA Protests", "lang": "en"}
