And now, a picture of policemen posing with a group of people has gone viral on social media with the claim that MP police arrested 25 child kidnappers from Ratlam.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim with the viral photo is not correct. The photo is related to a case where MP police arrested 23 members of a sex racket - 15 men and 8 women.\n\nThe viral claim posted by Facebook user \"Reetesh Namdeo\" has already attracted more than 5,500 shares at the time of filing this story. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe post is quite viral on Twitter as well.\n\nWe ran a reverse search on the image and found an article published in local news website \"Mandsaur Sandesh\" published on July 14, 2019. As per media reports, Ratlam police arrested 23 members of a sex racket. Other media houses also covered the incident.\n\nIn the viral image, one can read \"Karyalyay, Nagar Police Adhikshak, Jaora, Zilla Ratlam\" (Office of City Superintendent of Police, Jaora, District Ratlam) written on the board in the background. This also confirms that the incident as mentioned in news reports actually took place in Ratlam.\n\nThus, it is clear that the claim with the viral photo is not correct as the gang arrested in MP was running a sex racket and were not child kidnappers.", "lang": "en"}
